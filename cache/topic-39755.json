I would<br/>\n  watch it with my dad and since we lived in Charlotte, NC then I would<br/>\n  sometimes see the wrestling stars at local diners & movie theatres (which<br/>\n  was a major cool factor for me! haha) Anyway as the &quot;rumors&quot; started to<br/>\n  filter in to me that wrestling was staged I began to wonder if I could prove<br/>\n  or disprove it by tracking who won against who, who was portrayed as &quot;evil&quot;<br/>\n  and &quot;good&quot;, and all sorts of other things.  I never actually got this all<br/>\n  done (I was way too busy slaving away in school &lt;g&gt;), but I did have an idea<br/>\n  to put together a big chart to track many different things about the<br/>\n  wrestlers and try to find patterns in them.  I also wanted to track<br/>\n  &quot;signature moves&quot; and bio stuff like, who was married, how old they were,<br/>\n  did they have kids, etc.  There&#39;s tons of &quot;schooly subjects&quot; this type of<br/>\n  project could cover.  Maybe your son would find something like that fun. You<br/>\n  could even make a game out of it by using 2 different charts, one for you,<br/>\n  and one for him.  Keep your charts seperate for a while then bring them out<br/>\n  to &quot;compare&quot; notes to see who found the most info.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Zan (who is no longer a wrestling fan, but the trip down memory lane was<br/>\n  FUN!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you have questions, concerns or problems with this list, please email the Moderator, Joyce Fetteroll, at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!

If he&#39;s using Google to find new sites he&#39;s <br/>\nusing some Boolean Logic to get the right mix of words to produce the <br/>\nresults he wants. If he&#39;s reading the info about wrestling that&#39;s Language <br/>\nArts focusing on fiction vs. non-fiction. ;-) Practicing the moves is <br/>\nPhysical Education. And any discussion you may have with him about the odd <br/>\nnature of the wrestling shows would have to involve some Critical Thinking <br/>\nSkills. Does he guess on who is going to win based on their height, weight <br/>\nor strength? How about based on past performance?

I would<br/>\nwatch it with my dad and since we lived in Charlotte, NC then I would<br/>\nsometimes see the wrestling stars at local diners & movie theatres (which<br/>\nwas a major cool factor for me! haha) Anyway as the &quot;rumors&quot; started to<br/>\nfilter in to me that wrestling was staged I began to wonder if I could prove<br/>\nor disprove it by tracking who won against who, who was portrayed as &quot;evil&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;good&quot;, and all sorts of other things.  I never actually got this all<br/>\ndone (I was way too busy slaving away in school &lt;g&gt;), but I did have an idea<br/>\nto put together a big chart to track many different things about the<br/>\nwrestlers and try to find patterns in them.  I also wanted to track<br/>\n&quot;signature moves&quot; and bio stuff like, who was married, how old they were,<br/>\ndid they have kids, etc.  There&#39;s tons of &quot;schooly subjects&quot; this type of<br/>\nproject could cover.  Maybe your son would find something like that fun. You<br/>\ncould even make a game out of it by using 2 different charts, one for you,<br/>\nand one for him.  Keep your charts seperate for a while then bring them out<br/>\nto &quot;compare&quot; notes to see who found the most info.<br/>\n<br/>\nZan (who is no longer a wrestling fan, but the trip down memory lane was<br/>\nFUN!) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: the UN.. way of life..","postDate":"1028529872","msgId":39798,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3NS5jNzBkZjU2LjJhN2Y3OGQwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39796,"nextInTopic":39801,"prevInTime":39797,"nextInTime":39799,"topicId":39755,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/4/2002 10:16:31 PM Pacific Daylight Time, ...

Rules implies there is some kind of enforcer <br/>\n  -- some standard that we are required to follow. But - this is just email - <br/>\n  just a discussion list. You don&#39;t have to register as an unschooler and <br/>\n  nobody is authorized to check up on us &lt;G&gt;. People might say, &quot;That isn&#39;t <br/>\n  unschooling.&quot; So what? THAT itself is just something to consider -- think <br/>\n  about - &quot;Hey, maybe there is MORE to unschooling than I understood before - <br/>\n  let me ask some more or write some more and get more feedback about this new <br/>\n  development.&quot; Or they might think, &quot;Whoa - I think I was totally <br/>\n  misunderstood - let me clarify what I meant because I really DO think it is <br/>\n  unschooling. Let&#39;s see if my clarification changes the response.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Here on this list we often seem to talk about what unschooling really is -- <br/>\n  and when people do that, try to describe what they see as &quot;unschooling,&quot;  <br/>\n  sometimes other people feel like they are trying to impose rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think it does have to do, as Mary said, with how confident people are with <br/>\n  their own decisions. Some people feel personally criticized when someone <br/>\n  says, &quot;That isn&#39;t unschooling.&quot; Some people feel they are having rules <br/>\n  imposed on them when someone says: &quot;Using a formal phonics program is not <br/>\n  unschooling.&quot; Some people really have a desire to &quot;be&quot; unschoolers and it <br/>\n  feels bad to them when people take it farther than they really want to take <br/>\n  it. They see it as a power struggle over who gets the bragging rights - to <br/>\n  call themselves unschoolers. But REALLY it isn&#39;t about that - it is just <br/>\n  about exchanging ideas -- that&#39;s ALL.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Instead of feeling imposed on - a more confident person would say, to <br/>\n  themselves, &quot;Oh - interesting - that person doesn&#39;t think this is <br/>\n  unschooling. I wonder why not? I wonder what, in her opinion, an unschooler <br/>\n  WOULD do in this situation? I wonder if she really understood what I meant? I <br/>\n  wonder if there COULD be another way that would work better? I wonder if this <br/>\n  might actually have some deleterious side effects? I wonder what they might <br/>\n  be? Hmmm - I don&#39;t think I agree with this point she made - let me say on the <br/>\n  list why I don&#39;t agree and find out what the response will be - give me and <br/>\n  others something more to consider.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n  AND they might say, to themselves, &quot;Hmmm - I really like what we&#39;re already <br/>\n  doing - it is really working for us - so that comment didn&#39;t really hit home <br/>\n  for me. Maybe we&#39;re not as radical unschoolers as some others are  - <br/>\n  interesting to hear how far some people do take this, though. Should I change <br/>\n  what we&#39;re doing? I don&#39;t really want to. Well, at least I can consider other <br/>\n  options and know that there are people out there doing things differently. <br/>\n  Worth being aware of that in case I do decide that what we&#39;re now doing is no <br/>\n  longer working well for us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  --pamS<br/>\n  National Home Education Network<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\n  Changing the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you have questions, concerns or problems with this list, please email the Moderator, Joyce Fetteroll, at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
