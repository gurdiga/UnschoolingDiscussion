I hadn&#39;t even <br/>\nnoticed the kinds of imagery I have been using in my thinking and talking and <br/>\nwriting. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked this.  It was about my comments on Kelly saying she felt like she was <br/>\nin a tunnel.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery few months someone comes along here or some other unschooling <br/>\nthink-tank places, lays out a VERY clearly scary, negative load, and then gets angry if <br/>\nanyone sees what they&#39;ve deposited.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone did that at unschooling.com just the other day.  He was FURIOUS, <br/>\nbigtime, that we thought we knew anything about him.  We knew a WHOLE lot about <br/>\nhim, including that he couldn&#39;t even see what he himself had written, and <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t feel the frustration that was just oozing out of him, and that he didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow that he didn&#39;t even much *like* his poor little boy.  That poor kid didn&#39;t <br/>\neven know how to go for a walk in the woods right.  He just kept looking for <br/>\ngood sticks, and that was WRONG.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo after several comebacks from the dad batting away the really great <br/>\nfeedback of a dozen generous volunteers, he said the whole thing was a waste of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHOW WRONG for him.  <br/>\nEveryone who wrote benefited.  Her own understanding deepened.  She was a <br/>\nbetter person for having given freely of her experience.<br/>\nThose who were reading but not posting and who were undecided were benefited.<br/>\nEveryone who read it, I&#39;m guessing, felt an emotional reaction that either <br/>\nmade her feel a little guilty for having thought similar things, or maybe very <br/>\ngrateful for NOT having thought them lately or ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis child got a lot of sympathy from the readership, and the author (who had <br/>\nall kinds of freedom to think, to restrain himself, to withhold information, <br/>\nto edit before posting) was getting none.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat he wanted was for us to tell him he was right, he was doing a good job, <br/>\nhe was a great dad.  It&#39;s not what he got.  What he got was people saying his <br/>\nkid was right, and a good kid, and needed a great dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the very idea that we had no way of knowing anything about his situation <br/>\nor what the level of regard for his child was was bigtime delusional on his <br/>\npart.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone wants to read that, if you go to the last entries, all the <br/>\noriginal/previous show up at the top.
