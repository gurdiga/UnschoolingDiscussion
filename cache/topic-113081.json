We always  call <br/>\nfirst before going over because her kids are doing school and we really  never <br/>\nknow when they will finish.<br/>\nMy younger niece (11) has math, history, writing, reading, violin and more  <br/>\nas well as household chores that must be complete before she can  play.  <br/>\nSometimes, she can&#39;t come over if she hasn&#39;t  completed  them.   Logan doesn&#39;t mind <br/>\nat all helping his cousin  finish up her math but sometimes I get the idea <br/>\nthat my sister thinks that&#39;s  &quot;cheating&quot;  Very weird for us.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe older niece is 16 and is swamped with work.  She plays the piano 4  hours <br/>\na day, goes to music, voice, dance classes, takes online classes in  Spanish, <br/>\nChemistry, and Algebra 2, is studying for the SAT and goes to a  Huntington <br/>\nlearning center twice a week for tutoring  where they also give  her work to do <br/>\nat home.  All with the ultimate goal of her getting into a  private college <br/>\nnext year and winning scholarships.  Certainly a different  path than we are on.<br/>\n <br/>\nThey have multiple performances with either the symphony or chamber music  or <br/>\nmusic conservatory.  I&#39;m exhausted just writing about it.<br/>\n <br/>\nThese 4 cousins have been inseparable since they were very young but their  <br/>\nwork load now doesn&#39;t leave much time for them to just hang out.  We often  <br/>\nstop by to see my mom who lives with them and the kids are just  not available.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think it will be a great comparison story in about 5 years of 2 families  <br/>\nwho didn&#39;t have their kids in school but one was traditionally homeschooled  <br/>\nand the other unschooled.

My daughter would like to spend more<br/>\n&gt; time with her, but her mother does homeschooling in a different way<br/>\n&gt; from us.  They use a classical curriculum that involves a lot of<br/>\n&gt; reading and regular schoolwork.

But, in the high<br/>\n&gt; school years I sometimes hear that little voice asking me if I have<br/>\n&gt; prepared them enough for whatever they decide to do, if I should be<br/>\n&gt; pushing them more. Do you know what I mean?  I believe that they use<br/>\n&gt; Ambleside Online which looks like a very demanding curriculum. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have basically been avoiding the issue of how we homeschool in our<br/>\n&gt; discussions.  This young woman may be coming over to visit this week,<br/>\n&gt; but she says that she will have to bring her schoolwork with her.  I<br/>\n&gt; guess my daughter can do something to keep herself busy while she is<br/>\n&gt; here, but it seems so silly.  I know they would rather interact<br/>\n&gt; instead.

I am fantastic at coming up with <br/>\nways in which my life is wonderful and other people&#39;s lives, who choose <br/>\nnot to live as I do, aren&#39;t as good.  So, with that in mind, is she <br/>\nbringing the schoolwork because she wants to, truly wants to, or because <br/>\n1) it is the only way her mother would let her come over to your house <br/>\nfor an undirected activity or 2) because she has bought into the idea <br/>\nthat the only way to get ahead in life is to strive, strive, strive?  In <br/>\nthe end, I suppose it doesn&#39;t matter.  In the end the only thing for me <br/>\nthat matters is my relationship with my children.  So, if this young, <br/>\nintelligent, creative young woman and her family have a wonderful <br/>\nrelationship in spite of the pressures being placed on that relationship <br/>\nthrough the use of a demanding curriculum, or any curriculum, than, <br/>\nwell, good for them.  For me, I don&#39;t think my relationship with Simon <br/>\nand Linnaea would be as glorious as it is with the added burden of me <br/>\nbeing the director of their educational attainment.  It would limit how <br/>\nI see them.  It would put me in a position of monitoring their <br/>\nactivities to make sure they were achieving at an appropriate level, and <br/>\nI could set that bar as high as I wanted.  I would reduce their <br/>\nchildhoods to a college application with appropriate extra-curricular <br/>\nactivities and achievement tests and grades based on whatever curriculum <br/>\nI was using.  Instead everything they do is just about them doing <br/>\nsomething.  Their lives are rich with now and not limited by some future <br/>\ngoal.  So, however down I might be in comparing my child with some other <br/>\nchild I would quickly be able to turn that around to feeling so happy <br/>\nand so full of joy about who we are that there would be nothing to feel <br/>\nsour about.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout &quot;coming out&quot; as an unschooler, women are good at competition.  We <br/>\ncan be really good at subtly implying personal superiority that make <br/>\nothers feel somehow less than.  Not only have you been unwilling to <br/>\nshare your information, but you know exactly what curriculum the other <br/>\nfamily is using.  This other family has made available to you <br/>\ninformation about how they homeschool in such a way that lets you know <br/>\njust how hard they work, how perfect and good they are.  Simon has a <br/>\nfriend who is in school whose mother is good at touting his skills.  She <br/>\nis good at talking up his scholastic achievements.  However, she is also <br/>\nreally good at moaning about how burdensome he can be.  How hard it is <br/>\nto keep him from playing on his PS2 and how they have to limit him to a <br/>\nspecific amount of time per day.  How he can be a complete klutz and an <br/>\nabsolute idiot about remembering things.  How he could get lost in his <br/>\nown backyard.  So, because I listen I know she is willing to belittle <br/>\nher child, her son to someone else in the hopes of painting a more <br/>\namusing picture of her life, as well as using him to raise her status by <br/>\ndemonstrating his academic competence. I know that her relationship with <br/>\nhim is defined by  1) advancing him through academic achievement and 2) <br/>\nminimizing his leisure activities to (arbitrarily defined) reasonable <br/>\nlimits. Maybe if you listen to your daughter&#39;s friend and your <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s friend&#39;s mother you will see the cracks that can exist in a <br/>\nrelationship that is not based on the holism that unschooling tends to <br/>\nlead to.  You may want to choose not to publicly state that you are <br/>\nunschooling while not actively hiding your light under a bushel. You may <br/>\nwant to talk to your daughter about what she thinks would happen if you <br/>\n&quot;came out&quot; to her friend and her friend&#39;s family.

She is<br/>\na beautiful dancer and an intelligent, creative, and spirited young<br/>\nwoman like both of her parents.  My daughter would like to spend more<br/>\ntime with her, but her mother does homeschooling in a different way<br/>\nfrom us.  They use a classical curriculum that involves a lot of<br/>\nreading and regular schoolwork.  I respect this family a lot and do<br/>\nnot want to seem a &quot;bad&quot; influence on their daughter when I do not<br/>\nforce schoolwork on my daughter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, sometimes when I am around them I must admit that I begin to<br/>\nfeel like I have not done enough for my kids and that I must be lazy<br/>\nor something.  I really do not want to impose a curriculum on my kids.<br/>\n I know that they are constantly learning and that it is real learning<br/>\nonly when it comes from a desire inside of them.  But, in the high<br/>\nschool years I sometimes hear that little voice asking me if I have<br/>\nprepared them enough for whatever they decide to do, if I should be<br/>\npushing them more. Do you know what I mean?  I believe that they use<br/>\nAmbleside Online which looks like a very demanding curriculum.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have basically been avoiding the issue of how we homeschool in our<br/>\ndiscussions.
