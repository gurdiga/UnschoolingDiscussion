They want<br/>\nphonics. And drill work. And homework. And memorization.<br/>\n<br/>\nEducation of the past was for different purposes. It wasn&#39;t one size fits<br/>\nall. (Nor should it be.)

So for them it was, to an extent, practical knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers were learning for specific careers like bookkeeping or blacksmithing.<br/>\nIf they learned about their culture it was from living life not from their<br/>\nschooling (which might have been on the job training). (And their culture<br/>\nextended no further than English and Protestant so there wasn&#39;t nearly as<br/>\nmuch to learn.) They wouldn&#39;t have needed to understand the &quot;moyel line&quot;<br/>\nbecause no one else in their social class would have understood it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there was everyone else from the great unwashed illiterate masses<br/>\nto those who had the leisure to dabble in cultural literacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept for those who actually do need it in their careers, an education that<br/>\nhas the leisure to focus on impractical social and cultural knowledge is for<br/>\nthe elite who don&#39;t have to worry about competing for a good job and<br/>\nsupporting themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10722572,"authorName":"Nora or Devereaux Cannon","from":"&quot;Nora or Devereaux Cannon&quot; &lt;dcannon@...&gt;","profile":"thatincase","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] twelfth night","postDate":"1028661721","msgId":40006,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOWEwMWMyM2Q3ZSQ4ZTM5NzhlMCQ2NDIyZmVhOUBkYnE1MjBiPg==","referencesHeader":"PEI5NzU5MzFDLkIyQzQlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":39996,"nextInTopic":40059,"prevInTime":40005,"nextInTime":40007,"topicId":39847,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"To the extent that culture is understood to include the culture of various religions and to the extent that religion is banned in government schools under the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1282349784\">To the extent that culture is understood to include the culture<br/>\nof various religions and to the extent that religion is banned in<br/>\ngovernment schools under the rubric of separation of church and<br/>\nstate (bonus points if you know the religious basis of &quot;rubric&quot;),<br/>\nanything has to be better.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore seriously, yes I think there has been a decline in our<br/>\nattention to learning common culture, that is facilely handled by<br/>\ndismissing religion from school, but that actually is defeatism<br/>\nabout whether it is possible to become passingly familiar with<br/>\nthe different faiths that are regular parts of our experience in<br/>\ntoday&#39;s world.

The Catholic Church - and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2139145919\">One of the sad losses with government schools is the loss of<br/>\ncommon culture to understand so many references, like &quot;twelfth<br/>\nnight.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Catholic Church - and following on it, some other<br/>\ndenominations - keep a calendar through the year, a calendar of<br/>\nseasons and events.  The first day of the new church year is the<br/>\nfirst Sunday of Advent, which is the 4th Sunday before Christmas.<br/>\nAdvent is a season of prayerful preparation, like a mini-Lent.<br/>\nThe third Sunday in Advent is called Gaudete Sunday, BTW.<br/>\nChristmas Vigil is December 24; the feast of Christmas, December<br/>\n25.  The next 12 days are a celebration of the feast of<br/>\nChristmas.  There are several Saint&#39;s days scattered into the<br/>\nseason and some cultural events, such as boxing day in England (a<br/>\ngift giving day 12/26).  The Twelfth Day of Christmas is the<br/>\nFeast of the Epiphany, or arrival of the three wise men/kings.<br/>\nDepending on where you are, Epiphany is either a season that<br/>\nlasts until Lent or an event followed by a season called<br/>\n&quot;ordinary time&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nLent, called the slow fast, is the great penitential season of<br/>\nthe Church.  Various sacrifices and observances have been<br/>\ncommonly employed to mark the season.  Shrove Tuesday/Mardis Gras<br/>\nrefer to the same day - the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, marking<br/>\nthe last unfettered day before the fast.  Shrove relates to<br/>\nshriven, which is a term for being granted absolution after a<br/>\nsacramental confession.  In preparation for Lent folks would<br/>\nreceive the sacrament of Penance in order to observe  a worthy<br/>\nLent.  Fat Tuesday (English translation of Mardis Gras) refers to<br/>\nthe need to get rid of all the eggs, butter, meat and yummy stuff<br/>\nbefore Lent - think pancake suppers with bacon and sausage in<br/>\nmany places.  As a secular matter the dead of winter (as in<br/>\nJan/Feb) works well for a social season - there&#39;s not a heck of a<br/>\nlot else you can do, and the Church had no great events to<br/>\npreclude extending the preparation for Lent all the way back to<br/>\nEpiphany,<br/>\n<br/>\nAsh Wednesday, the beginning of Lent, is celebrated as a day of<br/>\nfasting, with members of many denominations wearing ashes on<br/>\ntheir foreheads as a sign of penance.  The ashes are prepared<br/>\nfrom the palms used the year before on Palm Sunday.  Lent<br/>\ncontinues for 40 days, culminating in Holy Week.  Holy Week<br/>\nstarts with Palm Sunday, commemorating the entrance of Jesus into<br/>\nJerusalem to celebrate the Passover.  You hang out then until<br/>\nThursday, which is the beginning of the Tridiuum (3 days - kinda<br/>\ncatchy, huh?).  Holy Thursday (Maundy Thursday/Gruendonnerstag)<br/>\ncelebrates the institution of the Eucharist and is usually<br/>\ncelebrated with the symbolic washing of feet as Jesus washed the<br/>\ndisciples&#39; feet.  New holy oils are consecrated for the year;<br/>\nfrequently some step in the reception of new members to the<br/>\nchurch is taken then.  The traditional name of Maundy comes from<br/>\n&quot;commandment&quot; or mandatum in the Latin - the new commandment of<br/>\nlove, given at the Last Supper.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Friday I think remains pretty well understood culturally;<br/>\nthe suspension between words that is Holy Saturday has no bearing<br/>\non those who are not churched.  Easter similarly is easy, but<br/>\nperhaps the &quot;Octave&quot; is not.  Easter is celebrated for 8 days<br/>\nafter the Sunday.<br/>\n<br/>\n... and the year continues.  For many years the only source of<br/>\ncalendar or of terms was the Church.  Without context, you miss a<br/>\nhuge amount of the richness of our literature and art. ... not to<br/>\nmention practical housekeeping.  The first Sunday of Advent is<br/>\ncalled &quot;Stir up Sunday&quot; as in &quot;Stir up you power, Oh Lord&quot; and<br/>\nwas how a housewife kept count that it was time to stir up the<br/>\nChristmas dishes that required long seasoning, like fruit cakes.<br/>\nFun stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sennmanor@...\">sennmanor@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 05, 2002 8:38 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] twelfth night<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| I think you might be confusing your seasons.
