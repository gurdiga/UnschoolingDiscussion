He wanted row after<br/>\n row of math problems.  So, I got him a workbook and he worked through the<br/>\n pretests until he hit one that he got fewre than 90% correct.  Then he<br/>\n started on the chapter, skipping what was easy, and spent a few weeks<br/>\n &quot;doing math&gt;&quot;  I say it is odd because I HATED math and just can&#39;t see<br/>\n someone enjoying doing it that way.  He&#39;d finished with that stage for<br/>\n now. &gt;&gt;<br/>\nDawn, all I have to say is, COOL . . .  Isn&#39;t it amazing what our kids do on <br/>\ntheir own. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m leaving Math-U-See for Carolyn, my 6 year old.  She hates it.  <br/>\nHates the manipulatives, refuses to use them.  Hates the worksheets too.  I&#39;m <br/>\ntaking a big gulp here.  Emily, my 11 year old, has done so well at using <br/>\nMath-U-See at her own speed, learning things in areas where she felt only <br/>\nfailure in public school.  But Carolyn is so different.  She mastered skip <br/>\ncounting by 5&#39;s, 10&#39;s and 2&#39;s, and addition with nine.  Now she wants nothing <br/>\nto do with addition with 8.  So, we&#39;ve dropped it.  I don&#39;t put out the books <br/>\nfor her anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you who pray, I would so appreciate your prayers for my family <br/>\nduring a very difficult time.   I have a growth in my leg that I hope to have <br/>\nsome answers to later this week.  It has prevented me from  being my usual <br/>\nactive self with my children.  And, my husband&#39;s sister passed away last <br/>\nweekend.  We saw her at Christmas and my oldest is having a really difficult <br/>\ntime with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7793,"nextTopicId":7670}}
