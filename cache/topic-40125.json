There are NO ABSOLUTES!  It makes reasonable discussion fun and enlightening.  My personal opinion, one based somewhat in cynicism due to personal conflicts with &quot;The Church&quot; (meaning the establishment, the political structure, the *rules*) has led me to interpret the integration of pagan sites and customs as a shrewd political move.  But the neat part is that while one bishop in one area may have been more politician than saint, other areas saw dedicated men and women driven by the Holy Spirit just doing their best to spread the word.  I guess I look at it in a similiar vein as a daily-thought thing I read recently.  If you&#39;re having a bad day and want to shake the negative emotions, force a smile and start acting happy.  Pretty soon, you will be happy.  If you&#39;re having trouble converting pagans, let them keep celebrating their holidays while you continue to convert.  In a few years, they&#39;ll start thinking of the holidays in Christian terms.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ve always loved religious history, from pre-history to present.  I attend a pretty conservative church in our rural area and don&#39;t get much chance at intelligent, non-hysterical dialogue about the bible and church history.  I am clear and confident in my &lt;liberal&gt; beliefs, but it is amazing to me how many Baptist friends have made it their mission in life to convince me of the error of my ways!<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, did you all know there are two distinctly different versions of Creation in Genesis?
