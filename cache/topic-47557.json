We would all<br/>\nbe belting each other and often. When do you stop assaulting the<br/>\nchild/ren? What age?When they learn what? Physically injuring little<br/>\npeople hurts. It is NOT OKAY! There are other ways. They might not be<br/>\nthe McDonalds (quick method)&quot;I feel angry so I think I will hit you so I<br/>\nget the control and power and you go away temporarily until next time&quot;<br/>\nway.  If you go overboard and cause bruises and welts what do you do/say<br/>\nto the child? Can you control your own anger? Can YOU learn a different<br/>\nway of thinking and reacting instead of physically injuring your child<br/>\nto release these emotions? I think so many adults expect more out of<br/>\nkids than they do themselves or other adults and it REALLY makes me<br/>\nangry. I am not going to hit you for it though. Your kids don&#39;t get that<br/>\nchoice do they?
