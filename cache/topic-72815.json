One <br/>\nteacher, at the beginning of the school year, would tell our foster son to <br/>\n&quot;wait&quot; to go to the bathroom.

Our situation with them, though, is we <br/>\nwere not allowed to homeschool them...otherwise I&#39;d have pulled them out 2 years <br/>\nago.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am doing pretty much what you explained in your post, with my 2 girls (they <br/>\nare older) who are in school.  I help them when they&#39;re stuck on homework, I <br/>\nbuy them things they need for school, but if they complain about getting up in <br/>\nthe morning, or the bus ride, or the homework, or the teachers, I let them <br/>\nknow I understand how they feel, but they knew this is how it would be when they <br/>\nbegan attending.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not do the whole &quot;school mom&quot; thing.  I go to conferences, I talk with <br/>\nthe foster boy&#39;s special ed teachers when there are problems, and I send <br/>\ncookies and such with them to school for parties.  I have attended field trips too.  <br/>\nBUT...I don&#39;t make them do homework I feel is useless, or over their heads, <br/>\nor BORING...They have gotten some bad grades, maybe because of missed homework, <br/>\nbut oh well.  The school has pretty much written them off as handicapped or <br/>\nretarded, so we&#39;re just crossing our fingers and toes that the adoption will be <br/>\nfar enough along that they won&#39;t have to go back and deal with the school&#39;s <br/>\ncrap next year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to ask my daughters to read the &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; over <br/>\nthe summer.

Maybe <br/>\nplan some cool trips for the 12 year old and remind her that she could do <br/>\nthese things all year round if she wasn&#39;t in school.

Or only if it<br/>\nbecomes<br/>\na problem with the children/adults in the home do you not support the<br/>\nattitudes?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious about what&#39;s really being said, I have one child who is thinking<br/>\nabout taking a semester off from college and one that wants to go and tour a<br/>\nprivate school that one of her friends is considering going to.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m answerinjg because I&#39;ve somewhat been there. Although Tara was always in<br/>\nschool, I wanted her to come home. Very much so. She was really on the fence<br/>\nabout what to do. We laid out a few choices and I left it all up to her. She<br/>\nchose school. I did support her decision, although I didn&#39;t like it, because<br/>\nwe both understood exactly what that meant for each of us. She also had the<br/>\nchoice to stop at any time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not an involved school mom. Did that when she was younger and I thought<br/>\nI had no choice and wanted to make the best of it. I go to school when it<br/>\nhas to do with college, which she wants to go to, or a matter of her safety.<br/>\nHer homework is hers along in the fact that I don&#39;t ask what she has or if<br/>\nshe&#39;s done it. If she needs any kind of help with a project, she&#39;ll ask I<br/>\ncertainly help with what I can. Grades are no big deal to me and she is much<br/>\nmore relaxed now in how she looks at them. So from that, she&#39;s actually<br/>\ndoing better and does like the grades she gets. When she brings home the<br/>\nreport, I ask first of all if she is happy with it and look at the comments<br/>\nand ask about those and the teachers. It&#39;s not all well did you get A&#39;s or<br/>\nB&#39;s?? If she&#39;s happy and satisfied, then I am happy for her. If she isn&#39;t,<br/>\nwe talk about making it work better for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is any problem at school that she talks to me about, and we talk a<br/>\nlot and it&#39;s only natural that some of those stories involve school, I will<br/>\nask if I can do anything to help. The answer has always been no and she<br/>\nhandles matters just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I do support her decision along with helping when I can, when she wants<br/>\nit. I offer her tools to manage the things she needs help with, whether it&#39;s<br/>\nbecause of school or something else. It&#39;s not very schooly at all. It&#39;s<br/>\npretty much like she has a job during the day and we talk about it<br/>\nafterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"jmcseals SEALS","from":"&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] forced homeschooling?","postDate":"1055278944","msgId":73553,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjM5dlZIMUx6ZVJXSU8wMDAyNzI3N0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73550,"nextInTopic":73565,"prevInTime":73552,"nextInTime":73554,"topicId":72815,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Hehe, quiet?

But I can&#39;t imagine not supporting my <br/>\nchild<br/>\nin something they really wanted to do.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t speak for anyone else but you pose an interesting question.  Quiet <br/>\nthought provoking!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had a child that wanted to go to school, yes, if asked, I would help <br/>\nthem with their homework.  Not because it was a requirement, but if my child <br/>\nwas truly interested and wanted my help.  I would never push them to do it <br/>\nin any way.  They would know that I am not supportive of public schools but <br/>\nthat I support THEM.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I wouldn&#39;t go full blast into being a room mom and supporting the <br/>\nschool through PTA funds, etc.  UNLESS, being a room mom meant that I might <br/>\nhave more involvment with my child and it didn&#39;t bother my child having me <br/>\nthere.  In that case, it would be out of my own desire to be near my child <br/>\nand his desire to have me there.  I would do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would help with homework, if asked, just as I help out with various <br/>\nschoolish things at home that my children ask for help with.  Nicholette <br/>\nasks to do reading and phonics work in some old workbooks and textbooks we <br/>\nhave and I oblige.  Sometimes, I might offer another way to learn the <br/>\nmaterial, but she truly loves the schoolishness of it all.  That&#39;s fine with <br/>\nme.  I love doing textbook work myself!  I recently purchased some textbooks <br/>\nfrom our local college to learn on my own and hopefully to later clep out of <br/>\nif I decide I want a degree in something.  Not that far into the future at <br/>\nthis time, though. &lt;g&gt;  Right now, it&#39;s just curiosity in a new field and <br/>\nsomething to help me out of some personal financial struggles.  If it piques <br/>\nmy interest enough, I may later use that knowledge to become a CPA to make <br/>\nsome side money from home.  Probably, I&#39;ll just have the knowledge for my <br/>\nown good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the thing is that if our children want to go to school and we are <br/>\nfirm believers against it, that by fully supporting it, we are going against <br/>\nour own principles and giving our children a double standard.  If we arm our <br/>\nchildren with knowledge and empower them with confidence, I also believe <br/>\nthey will come home.  I cannot imagine a child wanting to be stuck in a <br/>\nsituation where they have no control.  Even with parents who do not adhere <br/>\nto the importance of grades and such, there will be loads of pressure from <br/>\nteachers, administrators, friends and the like to conform.  I just don&#39;t see <br/>\nhow a child would stay in a situation like that.  Perhaps if their social <br/>\nlife in school outweighs the rest, they might make those decisions.  Perhaps <br/>\nif they are intent on being a pro football player, they will ride out high <br/>\nschool in order to have that experience and exposure public school affords <br/>\nfootball players.  But, perhaps they will find the social life they crave in <br/>\nps and decide they no longer need that as an outlet and will use their <br/>\nresources to continue the social life outside the school walls.  They might <br/>\npossibly decide that football isn&#39;t in the cards and want to come home to <br/>\nfully pursue new interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think school, especially for those children who have not attended, is a <br/>\nfantasy; a falacy they will all too soon figure out and want to avoid in <br/>\npursuit of their own dreams.  Their own lives.  On their own time and in <br/>\ntheir own way.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nHelp STOP SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8151304,"authorName":"rubyprincesstsg@aol.com","from":"rubyprincesstsg@...","profile":"rubyprincesstsg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: forced homeschooling?","postDate":"1055276608","msgId":73546,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwOS4yNDdjNjZmOC4yYzE3OTg0MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":73541,"nextInTopic":73550,"prevInTime":73545,"nextInTime":73547,"topicId":72815,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/10/2003 4:02:32 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

It was really, really hard on me. He did fine <br/>\nactually.

I <br/>\ndid help my son with studying for exams because he wanted it <br/>\nand I could be of help. I did pretty well until fijnal exams when I <br/>\nrelapsed pretty badly. I did apologize and we came to a healing <br/>\nfrom it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for next year, I told him that I was going to stay out of all <br/>\nstudying and homework. I&#39;m happy to offer help with material, but <br/>\nnot with habits or deadlines.
