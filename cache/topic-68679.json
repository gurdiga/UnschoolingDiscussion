(cutting a LOOONG, bitter story short) His <br/>\ndad&#39;s family is poisonous, and I really didn&#39;t want him there. My mom <br/>\ntried taking him for awhile, but he wanted his dad and his dad&#39;s <br/>\nfamily. (more cutting) dad&#39;s sister introduced him to Meth :( and he <br/>\nended up in prison for three years, from age 17 to age 20. And WENT <br/>\nTO LIVE WITH HIS DAD&#39;S FAMILY!!!!! and I was in anguish, but my wise <br/>\ndad said &quot;He&#39;s an adult. His choice. His life. Let him choose and <br/>\nleave him be. We don&#39;t have to agree, and we are allowed to tell him <br/>\nso, but it&#39;s HIS life.&quot; And so I swallowed my tongue and developed an <br/>\nulcer, hating that he had gone to his paternal gramma&#39;s house...(six <br/>\nmore months passed)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was able to see, without my nagging him and fretting at him, with <br/>\nhis own two eyes, how chaotic and dysfunctional his dad&#39;s family is, <br/>\nand he moved out of there ON HIS OWN. I didn&#39;t tell him to, I didn&#39;t <br/>\nask him to. He just DID IT. Still goes over and says hello, but will <br/>\nnever move in over there EVER again. And if I&#39;d had my way, he&#39;d <br/>\nmoved in with us, or with my mom and dad, and still been craving his <br/>\ndad&#39;s family...<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiC who sees this self-learning in ALL her kids!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":144628419,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"&quot;Kelli Traaseth&quot; &lt;tktraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] was smoking, now: feeling uncomfortable with games","postDate":"1052750966","msgId":68679,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNzIwMWMzMTg5NSRhZjVmNTRjMCRhMjMzMTlhY0B5b3VyZ2c4N3Zxem96cT4=","referencesHeader":"PDlENkNGOUNFQTc2ODNDNEQ4RjQxNUEzRjU0RDFDMDY2MDEyRjdFOEFAZHN0cDEuZGVsdGFzb2x1dGlvbnMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":68729,"prevInTime":68678,"nextInTime":68680,"topicId":68679,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But before I could post, I realized that he had stopped playing<br/>\nit.**<br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing happened to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also feeling this way about Grand Theft Auto: Vice City<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 10 ds,  wanted to rent it,  so we did.       I was watching him play it<br/>\nand in part of it you kill people in different ways.   One was you could<br/>\nbeat them with a golf club,  the blood comes out onto the pavement.<br/>\nEwwww,,,it really bothered me.   You can keep beating this person.  Sent<br/>\nchills down my spine.   The kids see it so differently though,  seeing it so<br/>\nmuch as a game and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell,  I was sitting there with knots in my stomach,  trying to figure out<br/>\nhow to talk with them about how I was feeling.   They lost interest.   The<br/>\npart they liked was driving vehicles around.  They played it maybe for 2<br/>\nhours and then put in Spyro.  Alec said it really wasn&#39;t very exciting.<br/>\n(Although I liked the music it played,  &lt;g&gt; all this 80&#39;s stuff from high<br/>\nschool).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he decided on his own that it wasn&#39;t worth his time.   I didn&#39;t get to<br/>\ntalk with him about it very much,  which I&#39;m wondering now if I should.<br/>\nBut now its gone.   I might bring it up sometime,  why it did bother me, but<br/>\nI dodn&#39;t want him to feel guilty for playing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so realizing that we are all sensitive to different things.   He wasn&#39;t<br/>\nbothered by Vice City,  but then really had a hard time watching Robin Hood:<br/>\nPrince of Thieves,  (I had mentioned this before on this list).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does show how much we can truly trust our children.    It blows me away<br/>\nthat I never knew this before we started unschooling.   Had never been<br/>\nexposed to this kind-of thinking.  Its so radical for so many people.<br/>\nUnfortunately.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI really wish more people knew this.  Some more shouting from the rooftops!<br/>\n&quot;YOU CAN TRUST YOUR CHILDREN!&quot;   &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68727,"nextTopicId":68660}}
