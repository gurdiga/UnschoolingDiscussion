All of my son&#39;s <br/>\nfriends are going to pre-school now, and i find it strange, lonely and quiet. <br/>\n The one HS event we go to is HS choir and my son runs rampant the whole <br/>\ntime! Oh well! I am sticking to it.  Like some of the rest of you, i have <br/>\npractise doing my own thing----on the organics end of things, slowly eating <br/>\nless meat, extended breastfeeding.  At a mom&#39;s group this morning the topic <br/>\nwas &quot;proud to be a mom&quot; and all the women were going on and on about how <br/>\nimportant it is to be at home, how it is an honourable profession, and how we <br/>\nneed more govn&#39;t recognition, and how well our kids turn out when we&#39;re home <br/>\nfor the early years.  Then one mom said, &quot;the only problem i see with staying <br/>\nhome is how difficult it is for our kids to adjust to being away from us and <br/>\ngoing to school&quot;!!! I squirmed and pontificated to myself (i don&#39;t want to be <br/>\na crusader in this group).  So many people take the home-based natural living <br/>\nthing so far, and then no more.  They might breastfeed, but for a short time, <br/>\nthey might stay/work at home, but then send their kids to school.  What i <br/>\nwished everyone out there understood, is that HS is just taking it one step <br/>\nfurther again, and teaching our kids at home, as a family together.  I know <br/>\npeople don&#39;t see it this way, because it is still viewed as an &#39;exotic&#39; <br/>\nlifestyle choice by so many.<br/>\n<br/>\ncath -montreal</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13647,"nextTopicId":13649}}
