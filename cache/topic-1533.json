We&#39;ve been unschooling since and will continue to do so.<br/>\nIt&#39;s new for both of us!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNo, I&#39;m not with a support group. There is one that meets monthly at<br/>\nour church (First Baptist), but I&#39;m not interested. Everyone around here<br/>\nlooks at me like I&#39;m crazy when I mention unschooling. That support<br/>\ngroup has nothing we need. The families in our church (and most others<br/>\naround here) are homeschooling young/younger children and are using<br/>\nstrictly Christian curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHave you found ANY kind of an unschooling community here in the<br/>\nLowcountry? <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\tPeace,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\tDenise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Stop by for a cup of tea ~ <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/sc/tealover\">http://www.angelfire.com/sc/tealover</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Denise where are you?
