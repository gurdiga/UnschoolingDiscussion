I would feel that she thought I was an imbecile who couldn&#39;t care for herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were a situation where I lived there and she continued to do &quot;everything&quot; for me, I&#39;d also start wondering why she seemed to have no respect for herself.  I DO think that part of living in a family means that everyone is responsible to everyone else-- creating a mess and then expecting someone else to clean it up for you is disrespectful.  If this occurred in my household and I&#39;d made a mess and my mom cleaned it up, I&#39;d feel as though she was allowing herself to be treated more like a servant than a mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that&#39;s just me-- but I think that there&#39;s a certain level of give & take here.  Yes, as others have said, sometimes requests for help are a way of asking for something totally different that the child cannot yet articulate.  And sometimes making a mess and expecting mom to take care of it is an expression of disrespect to mom.  And I also think that continually having mom pick up after me would make me feel that she saw me as incompetent AND that she didn&#39;t have much respect for herself as a member of the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know... could any of that be what&#39;s going on?

My husband <br/>\nthinks I do for my kids too much also. The kids are so use to the gates <br/>\nbeing up in the kitchen that when they aren&#39;t, the kids put their stuff on <br/>\nthe counter for me anyway. (pass through from kitchen to playroom) So <br/>\ninstead of saying, &quot;the gates down put your own glass or plate away&quot;, I grab <br/>\nit and do it. What&#39;s the big deal, I&#39;m standing right there. I&#39;ll pour their <br/>\ncereal or toast their bagel or poptart or get them a cookie. Again, I enjoy <br/>\ndoing for them and don&#39;t see it as life altering doing these things. My kids <br/>\ndo appreciate it. When I ask, &quot;who will help me clean up?&quot; I usually get 2-3 <br/>\nresponses as in &quot;I&#39;ll help you.&quot; Sometimes it&#39;s only one, I always get at <br/>\nleast that though. Tonight my daughter was crampy. When I asked if she took <br/>\nanything, she said she would. I went and got her some ice tea and the pills <br/>\nand brought them to her to take. She&#39;d do the same for me and has.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has a tendency to think sometimes that when kids can do for <br/>\nthemselves, they should. This doesn&#39;t creep into his thinking often, usually <br/>\nonly when I&#39;ve had a rough day or haven&#39;t slept in days. Of course he also <br/>\nthinks I do too much for him also.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I lost my thought. You were wondering why doing all these things has <br/>\nyour children not showing you respect. Could it be that you jump up to do <br/>\nwhen you aren&#39;t even asked? I&#39;ve been yelled at by my husband and mom for <br/>\nthat reason. My mom says I have a rubber butt.....bouncing up and down all <br/>\nthe time. All someone has to do is mention something and I&#39;m up getting it. <br/>\nUsually they had all the intention of getting it themselves. I just won&#39;t <br/>\ngive them the chance. My husband still jokes that he had to retrain me when <br/>\nwe met. I was always jumping up to get whatever he wanted. I was previously <br/>\nmarried to one of those guys that Sandra thinks are now 95. They do still <br/>\nexist!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe you are doing too much without being asked and without giving <br/>\nanyone a chance to do for themselves. You said you are constantly doing for <br/>\nothers, maybe slow down and look at exactly what you are doing and what the <br/>\ncircumstances are at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE* <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122926724,"authorName":"Rachel Ann","from":"Rachel  Ann &lt;hindar@...&gt;","profile":"salixj","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Housecleaning/homemaking/doing for others","postDate":"1042163328","msgId":54149,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFMUUyNjgwLjAwMDAwMS4wMzc2MEBBbm9saWNrRmFtaWx5Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDFiZC4xYWFhZjI2Yi4yYjRmNWQwYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":54171,"prevInTime":54148,"nextInTime":54150,"topicId":54149,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I do for my children.
