I am not expert on anything except my own daughter, <br/>\nbut I do hope you&#39;ll consider joining this group as well and posting <br/>\na bit on your beliefs. There are already a few homeschoolers but also <br/>\nmany who seem to have blindly internalized the mainstream views <br/>\n(maybe &quot;It was done to us so we&#39;ll do it to them&quot; or something like <br/>\nthat.) <br/>\n<br/>\nEllen owner HSCBOOK***<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I posted this at the boards, more unschoolers have joined the <br/>\nlist.  I just wanted to let other unschooling parents of highly <br/>\nsensitive children know about it...Here&#39;s the homepage:  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hscbook/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hscbook/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBe Well ~<br/>\nAnne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81730,"nextTopicId":81426}}
