Whatever. It is what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an 8 year old daughter who craves a lot of time with other people, <br/>\nespecially me. She seems to get her energy in an extroverted fashion, by <br/>\nbouncing ideas off of other people. She also thinks outloud. I think it is a <br/>\npositive thing for her to crave my attention. She needs another being in <br/>\norder to get her creative juices flowing and I&#39;m her first choice. That&#39;s a <br/>\ncool thing. She also has tons of cool stuff that could be used alone, but <br/>\nshe prefers to do with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I know I can&#39;t be involved with her for awhile, I will often bring out <br/>\nsomething interesting and set it out on the table. Quite often she&#39;ll get <br/>\ninto it with me and then let me drift off to do my own thing. She&#39;ll then <br/>\nremain happily engaged in the toy or project on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always tried to approach her need for me in positive terms. (And I&#39;m <br/>\nnot saying you don&#39;t, just giving you my experience.) As she gets older, I <br/>\nhave noticed more and more independence. But it&#39;s not because it&#39;s something <br/>\nI&#39;ve tried to develop in her. It&#39;s more that she knows I&#39;ll always help her <br/>\nor be with her or play with her. She knows that I&#39;m accepting of Who She Is <br/>\nright now, whether she&#39;s demanding my time or playing alone. I think that <br/>\nhas freed her up to venture off more on her own and to be more independent. <br/>\nShe knows I will not be dissappointed should she decide to be bored or needy <br/>\nof me again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as TV, computer or electronic media goes.....we have them, we use <br/>\nthem.

It&#39;s not intended as such. It&#39;s intended as help. Many<br/>\npeople *have* found it helpful to dig deeply into what may have felt like<br/>\ndecisions based on solid thought to uncover the ones based on comfort for<br/>\ntheir fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we don&#39;t feel comfortable questioning ourselves, we can at least<br/>\nappreciate the time someone took to think about our problem and help in a<br/>\nway they thought might be useful and perhaps find comfort in the fact that<br/>\nour question may have prompted the exact answer someone else reading along<br/>\nneeded to hear.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we insist that answers be limited to the type we want to hear, then we<br/>\nnot only eliminate the ones we don&#39;t want to hear, but eliminate the<br/>\ncreative ideas we never would have thought of.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is perhaps a fact of life that people will happily give of their time<br/>\nwhen they feel their time is being appreciated. People *do* recognize the<br/>\nhelp they have to offer won&#39;t necessarily be helpful but they *are* doing<br/>\nthe best they can.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also helpful when we don&#39;t get the responses we expected, to back up<br/>\nand look at how we worded our questions. Those very few things we&#39;ve chosen<br/>\nout of our lives to represent the sum total of what we are are all people<br/>\nhave to go on. If, for instance, we&#39;ve expressed a question in terms of our<br/>\nconcerns rather than something that&#39;s bothering our children, the answers we<br/>\nget will reflect that.
