Some <br/>\nkind of mania.   He should spend that time with his kids instead.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThat list, if anyone wants to go and discuss these things with him on his own <br/>\nturf, is <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HSDiscussions/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HSDiscussions/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I don&#39;t think he mentioned there, and didn&#39;t mention here, is that he&#39;s <br/>\nworking on a PhD in Education.   What he does mention there is that he was <br/>\nthrown off another homeschooling list recently.   He detailed it.   Honestly, he <br/>\ncould be spending that time with his children.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of our moderators (there are several) wrote this of the list, and it <br/>\napplies here:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- This list is for people who want to unschool, or who (whether<br/>\nthey want to or not) think unschooling might be what their kids need.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-The purpose of this list is not to wrestle with people who don&#39;t want to<br/>\nunschool just for exercise, or to entertain spectators.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-. . .that&#39;s the purpose of the waiting period, to let people do some of <br/>\ntheir<br/>\nown reading and thinking, rather than banging their spoons on their<br/>\ntrays and insisting we feed them whatever they want.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Keith and I were reviewing the day, and we both had stories of our <br/>\nkids being sweet to each other, and funny, and surprising us with their <br/>\ngenerosity.
