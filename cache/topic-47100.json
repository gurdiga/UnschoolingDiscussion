Maybe, in this regard, think of her as a<br/>\nfriend to help you see the difference between molding her and helping her.<br/>\n<br/>\nPresumably she doesn&#39;t want cavities.

Does she object because<br/>\nit&#39;s another one of those things that&#39;s always been forced? I know as a<br/>\nchild I remember brushing teeth taking a good half hour all by myself while<br/>\nthere were way more interesting things I could have been doing. Obviously it<br/>\nonly took 60 seconds of course ;-) but it seemed like half an hour! So I&#39;ve<br/>\nalways brushed my teeth with my daughter. She&#39;s old enough now to that it&#39;s<br/>\npretty much an automatic thing so she doesn&#39;t have to devote much<br/>\nconsciousness to it, but doing it together got her past the years when she<br/>\nwas hyperconscious of the tediousness of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, what about when she does slam that playstation out of<br/>\n&gt; frustration.

Say &quot;I&#39;m concerned that taking out your frustration on the Playstation<br/>\nmay break it one day. Is there something we can think of that you might bang<br/>\nor throw or do to release the frustration? Something we can keep right next<br/>\nto the Playstation?&quot; (And talk again to see how it working and whether<br/>\nsomething might work better.) And then when she does bang the Playstation,<br/>\nhumor helps as someone said. Saying &quot;The Playstation says Ouch!&quot; and then<br/>\nhand her something else to punch. Talk to her when she&#39;s not in the midst of<br/>\nplaying about what her feelings are before she gets to the<br/>\nneed-to-slam-the-Playstation feeling so she can become more aware of the<br/>\nbuildup and redirect it before it gets to that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssume she will unthinkingly slam the Playstation until she&#39;s able to insert<br/>\na moment of thought in there. It&#39;s a retraining as well as developmentaly<br/>\nissue.

Help her become more conscious of what she&#39;s<br/>\nfeeling and find new releases.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is she drawing on the walls? What about a big sheet of paper?

It is very eye-opening. <br/>\nAll other parenting books I&#39;ve read have had some excellent parts to <br/>\nthem, but this is the foundation of information that they all stand <br/>\non that I felt was missing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do I have a heart to heart with my <br/>\n&gt; daughter, and tell her there will be no punishments from me any <br/>\n&gt; longer?  She no longer needs to brush her teeth, or clean her room? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, you can tell her there will be no more punishments. Does that <br/>\nmean she no longer needs to brush her teeth? My own personal answer <br/>\nwould be no. Stepping away from punitive parenting doesn&#39;t mean you <br/>\nhave to become a completely permissive parent and allow your kids to <br/>\ndo anything. Teeth brushing is one of those things that is mandatory <br/>\nin our house. Then again, I have a very sensory-avoidant first child <br/>\nfor whom teeth brushing is extremely difficult - it used to be on the <br/>\norder of being tortured with hot irons - so I let it go for 2 years. <br/>\n$2,000 of dental work for him under general anesthesia later, I <br/>\ndecided it was mandatory and we found ways to get past the sensory <br/>\nissues. Live and learn!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe brush our teeth in the morning, and it must be done before we <br/>\nleave the house. We brush our teeth at night, and it must be done <br/>\nbefore I read stories. Sometimes it takes longer, sometimes shorter, <br/>\nI help the kids when they want help, but it always gets done. <br/>\nSometimes they just do it, sometimes they request silly songs or <br/>\ntooth brushing games. I think one important part of stepping away <br/>\nfrom punitive parenting is removing anger as a response. This is <br/>\nreally, really tough! Being kind, patient, but firm is not something <br/>\nmost of us have in our parenting tool box, so we have to acquire it <br/>\nsomehow, and practice it daily. It&#39;s really easy to descend into <br/>\nanger when you expect them to do something, like brush their teeth in <br/>\nthe next 5 minutes, and it doesn&#39;t get done. The anger itself is <br/>\npunitive, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, what about when she does slam that playstation out of <br/>\n&gt; frustration.  Just sit and wait - if she breaks it, she pays for <br/>\n </span></blockquote>it?  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (She and her brother share it). <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, the rule in our house is that you can slam, throw, or hit soft <br/>\nobjects (foam balls, pillows), but that if hard objects get slammed <br/>\naround or thrown, they go up until they can be used respectfully. <br/>\nUsually that&#39;s just a few minutes until the person calms down. This <br/>\nis a safety issue for me, and non-negotiable.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that I reiterate with my kids constantly is the <br/>\nfollowing &quot;Mom jobs&quot;. I tell them:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first job is to love you<br/>\nMy second job is to keep you safe<br/>\nMy third job is to keep you healthy<br/>\nMy fourth job is to help you find happiness<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if my child is doing something dangerous (throwing a hard object), <br/>\nit&#39;s my job to make sure they can&#39;t hurt themselves, things in our <br/>\nhouse, or others with that object. Reminding them of my jobs first, <br/>\nkeeps it first in our hearts that I love them, and that I&#39;m trying to <br/>\nkeep them safe and healthy. It lets them know that I&#39;m trying to work <br/>\nwith them, not against them. Often, I ask them for creative ways that <br/>\nwe can solve a particular problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If she slams her violin in <br/>\n&gt; frustration, how shall I handle it? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess that depends on how/why this is happening. Maybe she isn&#39;t <br/>\nready to be playing a delicate instrument if she is still in the <br/>\nphase where she is slamming things around. Maybe you could have a <br/>\ntalk with her about the instrument, why it is valuable, other ways <br/>\nshe can take out her frustrations. Maybe have an alternative punching <br/>\nbag sitting next to her while she practices that she knows she can <br/>\nhit? A basket of nerf balls she can throw? Or find ways to reduce the <br/>\nfrustration she&#39;s feeling while playing? Does she feel a lot of <br/>\npressure to play it well (either coming from herself or her teacher <br/>\nor others)? Are there ways to mitigate that pressure?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There need to be basic, <br/>\n&gt; considerate rules, for instance she can&#39;t throw things at the big <br/>\n&gt; screen tv, and can&#39;t color on the walls...  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Abandoning punitive parenting doesn&#39;t mean you have to go into <br/>\npermissive parenting and just have a free-for-all anything-goes kind <br/>\nof atmosphere. I found that it takes a paradigm shift. You have to <br/>\nget more creative, think of yourself as someone who is helping your <br/>\nkids learn the skills necessary to get along with other people, find <br/>\nsolutions to problems, find creative ways to vent anger, etc. This is <br/>\nwhat I personally mean by &quot;positive parenting&quot;, and we&#39;ve found it <br/>\ndoes work well in our family. My kids know that I&#39;m on their side, <br/>\nbut that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean I&#39;m going to guarantee their <br/>\nhappiness. If they break something, they need to find a way to help <br/>\nfix it. I will help them problem-solve, assist them in any way they <br/>\ncan, but they take responsibility for their actions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Please excuse the ignorant questions, this concept is so new to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>me!  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would have punished with priviledges lost, or no allowance in the <br/>\n&gt; past.
