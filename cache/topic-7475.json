I think when <br/>\nyou give to others as much as mothers do, you need to nurture yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually the times I have spent as a stay-at-home mom have been MORE tiring <br/>\nthan when I work, I think because the day seems so long, whereas my work <br/>\nschedule breaks things up a bit. Also, I don&#39;t do that much running around <br/>\non account of the kids; I&#39;ve limited things like sports and lessons outside <br/>\nschool because we have little enough time together as it is (sigh). And <br/>\nschool is 3 blocks away. I am looking forward to summer; I have been turning <br/>\nover in my mind the idea of doing away with school in our lives. Just wish I <br/>\nhad friends nearby like some of you all. But there is an unschooling group <br/>\nin the area that I plan to visit so maybe I&#39;ll find some likeminded souls.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, Carol and all, for the comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7474,"nextTopicId":7478}}
