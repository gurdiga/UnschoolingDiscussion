She counted all the<br/>\nalbums and then wrote down the names of artists that had more than one CD<br/>\nand wrote the number next to their names.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter lunch she asked how to figure out percentages.  We dug out her<br/>\ncalculator (she had to have one when the &quot;big boys&quot; decided they wanted to<br/>\ndo chemistry experiments) and the directions and spent a few minutes on<br/>\nexplaining how you do % both on the calculator and on a piece of paper (she<br/>\nasked &#39;what if I don&#39;t have my calculator).<br/>\n<br/>\nNo coercion, no &quot;stuff&quot; to get her interested, just a trust in her curiosity<br/>\nand imagination leading her to learn new things.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Bonni Sollars&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BSOLLARS@...\">BSOLLARS@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, April 13, 2002 9:16 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] thoughts<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Let your husband and his dad play with them!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; They do play cribbage together quite often.
