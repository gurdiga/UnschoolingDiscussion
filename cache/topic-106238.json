My daughter is having trouble creating the Sea Lion show she wants, can&#39;t seem to get water <br/>\nAND land in her show.

Also, I think the website has a hints section.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have never done a sea lion show, but I was having trouble doing a sea lion exhibit with both land and deep water, I had to put two exhibits right next to each other; one land and one water (with a water tank wall around the water exhibit, and a regular fence around the land exhibit).  If you make the walls that are shared the same height, the sea lions can go between exhibits.  I assume you could do the same thing with a show tank,  make it share a wall with a land exhibit, then make the walls the same height.  You will probably have to make a moat or another fence around the exhibits to keep the sea lions from escaping.  You can also sink the land exhibit a little, then the rock sides of the exhibit act like fences, but I don&#39;t know if that would work in conjunction with a show tank. <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":203597060,"authorName":"janethamlin@sbcglobal.net","from":"&lt;janethamlin@...&gt;","profile":"jefhdvm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Zoo Tycoon","postDate":"1117284193","msgId":106238,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjQwMWM1NjM4MiRkMDYyNzk2MCRjMTliZmVhOUBKQU5FVEhBTUxJTj4=","referencesHeader":"PDExMTcyNzIzNTcuMjM5MS4yMjM3Mi5tMTdAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":106242,"prevInTime":106237,"nextInTime":106239,"topicId":106238,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Does anyone s kids play this game?
