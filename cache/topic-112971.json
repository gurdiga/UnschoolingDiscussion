Or he can go to public school now. Or he can not go back<br/>\nto school at all. He was SO relieved, and even though he had been<br/>\nfeeling like he didn&#39;t want to go back, now that he has the choice,<br/>\nhe&#39;s thinking he WILL go back to the private school until the end of<br/>\nthe year. I told him he is free to change his mind if he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe seems very grateful for having his wishes listened to and<br/>\nrespected. I continue to be skeptical and a bit frightened of public<br/>\nmiddle school, but unless I find something actually dangerous, I&#39;m<br/>\ngoing to let him give it a try if it is what he really wants.

You know?**<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t been marinating in unschooling ideas long, then what I&#39;m <br/>\ngonna say may sound crazy to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think each kid is a better judge of what he can and can&#39;t do than his <br/>\nparent or his teacher is.  That&#39;s maybe hard to believe if you have a <br/>\nkid who hangs back cautiously from new experiences, as I do, but on some <br/>\nlevel, at least, I do believe it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be attractive to think that pushing and encouraging and noodging <br/>\ncan improve a kid&#39;s performance.  (Eep!)  But, I have seen kids come up <br/>\nwith wildly imaginative and varied ways to challenge themselves.  The <br/>\ntasks that they freely chose for themselves can be so creative that they <br/>\nput &quot;lesson plans&quot; of a teacher to shame.  It is really really hard to <br/>\nflog ourselves thru a series of hoops or tasks set up by others.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think learning has to be this hard.  (And I&#39;m a morning person, so <br/>\nplowing through homework in the evening when my brain is fried is <br/>\nespecially hard.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(I wish I could think of some of these creative challenge examples, but <br/>\nmy brain isn&#39;t retrieving them right now.  I hope others will post some.)<br/>\n<br/>\nA kid who struggles with a difficult task, say homework, doesn&#39;t <br/>\nnecessarily have a sense of elation or accomplishment when the paper <br/>\ncomes back with an &quot;A&quot; on it. (Even if we expect him to, or think we <br/>\nwould in his place.) And even if he did feel happy and satisfied for <br/>\nmany minutes, the satisfaction from completion or from his grade might <br/>\nstill not be strong enough to wipe out whatever self-talk and <br/>\nself-perception was happening while struggling with the task.  A kid <br/>\ncould carve a very long lasting memory (meme?) into his brain like &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nterrible at handwriting&quot; or &quot;Sentence diagramming stinks&quot; or &quot;I stink at <br/>\nfractions&quot;.  (Doing a math assignment without understanding the concept <br/>\nbeing practiced strikes me as an especially bad idea.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s some good stuff written by Frank Smith that talks about the fact <br/>\nthat we can&#39;t really learn when we are confused or frightened.  And I <br/>\nthink grades and competition can increase how frightened we feel.  <br/>\nSometimes our self-esteem is on the line.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152462241,"authorName":"katherand2003","from":"&quot;katherand2003&quot; &lt;katherand2003@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Problems with &quot;the decision&quot;--help?","postDate":"1143160111","msgId":112988,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR2dmVmZitrNWxpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGR2djNjNCtrY2dxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":112986,"nextInTopic":112990,"prevInTime":112987,"nextInTime":112989,"topicId":112971,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

What about just quietly fulfilling<br/>\nthe legal obligations for home schooling in your state (if possible) so that<br/>\nyou are then free to ask him each day if he wants to go to school &quot;today&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if this &quot;do what&#39;s expected&quot; dictum is feeling like an ultimatum or<br/>\neven abandonment to him. How could you support him being in a school where<br/>\nhe has his friends, but not enforce or support the &quot;do what&#39;s expected&quot;<br/>\npart? (I don&#39;t have an answer to this question, I&#39;m putting out there as an<br/>\nthinking tool).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the reasons to home school, let alone Unschool, is to avoid having to<br/>\nanswer to some one else&#39;s idea of what is &quot;expected&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for answering his fears for the future, you might get him Life Learning<br/>\nmagazine where Peter Kowalke publishes a column about the adult successes<br/>\n(and challenges but they seem good) of formerly Unschooled kids or the book<br/>\n&quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;.

I think that&#39;s understandable. <br/>\nWe have offered him homeschooling/unschooling in the past but he has <br/>\nbeen resistant to leave his school because of his friends. He blames <br/>\na lot of his problems on his private school and has been campaigning <br/>\nto be allowed to attend public school. He doesn&#39;t take responsibility <br/>\nfor his role in his trouble (giving up at the first sign of <br/>\ndifficulty, etc.) We believe that public school will be at best a <br/>\nwaste of time, at worst a meat grinder which will grind him up and <br/>\nspit him out in little pieces (pardon the disgusting analogy). (Of <br/>\ncourse we would pull him from public school if any hint if the meat <br/>\ngrinder scenario became apparent.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was SO upset last night about doing homework. He says he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to do ANYTHING, he just wants to sleep and read all the time and <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to be pushed into anything. He wants to spend his days <br/>\nin the library. Frankly, that sounds FANTASTIC to me, I have no <br/>\nproblem with it. But he is still resistant to leaving school all <br/>\ntogether. He actually said he&#39;s scared of not going to school now <br/>\nbecause he&#39;ll end up flipping burgers some day. I just don&#39;t think <br/>\nit&#39;s right for an 11yo of his intelligence to be worrying about that <br/>\nright now.....<br/>\n<br/>\nWe told him that he can either stay in school and do what&#39;s expected, <br/>\nin which case he can try public school in the fall, or he can leave <br/>\nschool now and commit to a year of unstructured learning, after which <br/>\nhe can return to school if he wants. I&#39;m hoping that he will make an <br/>\nactive decision, but I&#39;m worried that he is going to just let others <br/>\nmake the decision for him, which seems so disempowering......<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m looking for feedback here.
