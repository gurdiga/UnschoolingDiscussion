I think kids want to feel like <br/>\nthey&#39;re contributing - like they&#39;re an important part of what makes <br/>\nthe family work.  Different members of our family prefer different <br/>\njobs,  so most of the time,  I would say that a choice is available.<br/>\nI&#39;ve always also been flexible about timing, etc.  I don&#39;t expect <br/>\nthem to drop what they&#39;re doing immediately to clean the bathroom.<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t want to do that either.  When someone&#39;s not feeling well, <br/>\nthey probably won&#39;t have a job.  I think it&#39;s all about cooperation.<br/>\nThe kids are here all the time - not at school,  so they see what I <br/>\ndo and what their dad does.   They just seem to accept the fact that <br/>\nthey should help too.  Sometimes,  on days when we&#39;re feeling lazy,  <br/>\nwe try to help motivate each other.  My kids and I used to do <br/>\nsomething we&#39;d call commercial cleaning.  We&#39;d find a tv show we <br/>\nwanted to watch and then every time a commercial came on,  we&#39;d jump <br/>\nup and run off to see how much of our job we could get done before it <br/>\nwas over.   Our house is never spotless, and it&#39;s never a case for <br/>\nthe health department.  It&#39;s just a normal, lived in house that we <br/>\nall call ours.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane from KS<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2413,"nextTopicId":2395}}
