We have always homeschooled, but I am convinced that unschooling will be so much better. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaven&#39;t posted here yet, but wanted to say that this post is a great encouragement to me.  I am a voracious reader, also reading cereal boxes, shampoo bottles etc!  There are books all over the house, and many times I have a different book in each room that I am reading at the same time.  But my daughter hasn&#39;t picked up any great interest in reading.  In spite of what the commercials say, that if you want your kids to read then they should see you reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter sounds so much like your son.  She can read but not on the level &quot;they&quot; say she should be for her age.  Like your son, she can figure out how to put things together much better than I can, she has many interests and a lot of knowledge not picked up from books. She does like going to the bookstore or library though, but that&#39;s because she can socialize there and they have music and videos too!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first started kicking around the idea of unschooling, I was nervous about the reading and math.  After reading here and other places and thinking over how much more I learned outside of school than in it, I am ready to let go and let her be.  I realize I made alot of mistakes along the way, but I can see that now and am very excited about the changes ahead of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thanks to all of you who have gone on ahead blazing the trail!  Just lurking on these lists the last couple of weeks has helped me resolve some of my questions and fears.  You&#39;ve challenged my thinking and helped me to see things in ways I may not have considered before.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grlynbl@...\">grlynbl@...</a> <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Friday, August 15, 2003 11:20 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Does lots of books= Reading &quot;indoctrination&quot; ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an excellent question/thought.

We get a local trade paper every week and browse for <br/>\nbargains.   Barnes and Noble is a favorite hangout for Landon, Anna and I.    The <br/>\nlibrary is right up there with B&N.

(almost 12) couldnt care less if every book in the world <br/>\nburned up tomorrow.   Now, I do not mean that he hates books or has some <br/>\naversion to them.. the just does not care about them. .. at all.   He will opt out <br/>\nof going to the book store or library if he has an option.  ( Now that he is <br/>\nolder he can stay at home by himself).   He has some gaming magazines, but he <br/>\nmostly looks at the pictures.     He CAN read.. at a very basic level, but he <br/>\nwill avoid if at all possible.  I do not push him, never have.. and he was VERY <br/>\nfortunate to not have pushy teachers or some over  the top curriculum when he <br/>\nwas in school.   He does not seem to be ashamed of his reading level.   He <br/>\ndoes not seem embarrassed about it.  He is just ambivalent.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Our love of reading and the rich  reading/book availabilty environment that <br/>\nhe lives in, has zero affect on his feelings about reading.   Or in other <br/>\nwords,  he has not been indoctrinated, or even influenced by our &quot;lifestyle&quot; of <br/>\nreading or by the value that most of the members of our family places on books <br/>\nand reading.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I must make my disclaimer.  My description of Ethan and his reading ( or <br/>\nlack thereof)  does NOT mean I am worried about him, that I want to &quot;fix&quot; <br/>\nhim, or that something is &quot;wrong&quot; with him.   Ethan is a bright young man.  He <br/>\ncan do things, and he knows about things that none of my other children have a <br/>\nclue about.

He has <br/>\nbeen building lego models of Hummers.   Ethan has skills, interests, and <br/>\nabilities that he will most likely continue to explore and I have no fear that he <br/>\nwill have a full and happy, productive life.
