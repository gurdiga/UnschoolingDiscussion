I learned in British schooling that the past tense of DIVE is DIVED. It was strange to hear the common usage of DOVE over here in the States. Maybe it is also an issue of locality. Of course there are lots of minor language adjustments needed when a Brit comes to America. One very embarrassing moment for me was when I was tutoring for a Literacy Council. My student made a mistake.
