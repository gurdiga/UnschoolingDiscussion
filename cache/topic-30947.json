The girls and I plan out our meals in advance and they like going to the notebook to see what we are eating.

In my observation of<br/>\n+ adults, and through my own journey to grow-up (as an adult) I see<br/>\n+ that being organized is a learned skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat,<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s one thing to say &quot;being organized is an important skill&quot; and another<br/>\nthing to say &quot;you must be organized my way and be accountable to me&quot;.<br/>\nOrganization very definitely has its own inherent/intrinsic rewards....when<br/>\nit becomes important to your children, they&#39;ll either let you know or figure<br/>\nit out themselves.  I don&#39;t think it is necessary to devise systems *for*<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of us went to public school, right?  And we have widely varying degrees<br/>\nof &quot;organization skills&quot;, too, right?  I don&#39;t think school helps anyone<br/>\nbecome more organized....it certainly didn&#39;t help me.  I really think that a<br/>\nBIG part of one&#39;s ability to be organized is be innate, not learned.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t even know if organization can be learned....maybe, but I&#39;ve been<br/>\ntrying for years and I&#39;m not getting much closer to my ideals.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way you could help your girls is to show them in your life and in theirs<br/>\nwhere organization is helpful....or where you have challenges and why.  Get<br/>\nthem involved in whatever organizing you do--pay bills, sort mail, plan<br/>\nsocial activities, plan meals, shop, sew, cook, paint the house, build a<br/>\ndeck, plant a garden--whatever.  If *you* make a to-do list every day and<br/>\nallow them to be a part of *your* organizing, they will see how you benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are responsible for all their own activities.....gathering their<br/>\nmaterials for Scouts, signing up for camp and classes, making social<br/>\narrangements, even reminding me of what time and day their activities are.<br/>\n(I am *very* disorganized with this sort of thing--they&#39;ve HAD to be<br/>\norganized because I am NOT.....I keep a calendar, but get distracted during<br/>\nthe day and forget things....I do OK with morning activities, but by<br/>\nevening, I&#39;m lost again!  This hasn&#39;t always been a problem for me, but has<br/>\nbeen getting worse the last few years!)  If my kids are not organized, the<br/>\nconsequences are that they don&#39;t get to do that activity/event.  It&#39;s not<br/>\ncontrived....it&#39;s just a fact.  They also have several regular &quot;chores&quot;<br/>\naround the house that need to be done and most all of them have direct<br/>\nconsequences to them if they are not organized enough to get them done.<br/>\n(They do their own laundry--no clean clothes, feed their pets--or they die,<br/>\ntake turns unloading the dishwasher--or your sibling, whose turn it is<br/>\ntomorrow, nags you, clean their newly-pierced ears--or they close, take the<br/>\nnew puppy out to pee--or he messes in their bedrooms, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re part of my daily life--they know what tools I use to stay organized<br/>\nand what happens when I get disorganized.  They are very organized about<br/>\nwhatever&#39;s important to them.  I know they *can* be organized if they want<br/>\nto....if it is important enough to them.  They&#39;re not organized about<br/>\n*everything* in their lives, but they are a lot more responsible and<br/>\norganized than most kids their age...and, in fact, all 3 of them are<br/>\ngenerally more organized than I am.  They also have gone to work with their<br/>\ndad from time to time and have visited his office frequently....they see how<br/>\nPRISTINE his desk is (and how SLOPPY my home desk is!)  He is, luckily, very<br/>\norganized at home, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause organizing is a challenge for me, we do talk semi-regularly about<br/>\n*different* ways to do it.  We talk about whatever their organizing<br/>\nchallenges are and discuss different ways they might improve it.  We also<br/>\ndiscuss MY organizing challenges and different ways we can improve<br/>\nit....since almost every time I&#39;m disorganized, their activities suffer,<br/>\ntoo.  In our house, it hasn&#39;t been something we&#39;ve discussed, implemented a<br/>\nsolution, and never had to deal with again....it&#39;s very much an ongoing<br/>\nprocess!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think this is an important skill to learn, you can discuss that with<br/>\nyour children and explain your reasoning.  You can ask them what they think;<br/>\nask them how *they* organize things in their life currently--what works for<br/>\nthem and what doesn&#39;t.  You can tell them that you will be happy to help<br/>\nthem figure out what works for *them* so that things will be easier in their<br/>\nlives.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat, I get the idea that you&#39;re a very organized person.  Setting goals,<br/>\nmaking to-do lists and checking things off that list are probably pretty<br/>\nimportant to you.  But people can be organized in different ways....and even<br/>\ndisorganized people can be successful.  The most successful pay someone ELSE<br/>\nto organize things for them!  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, now I have to wrap up--Survivor is on.

If *you* make a to-do list every day and<br/>\nallow them to be a part of *your* organizing, they will see how you benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are responsible for all their own activities.....gathering their<br/>\nmaterials for Scouts, signing up for camp and classes, making social<br/>\narrangements, even reminding me of what time and day their activities are.<br/>\n(I am *very* disorganized with this sort of thing--they&#39;ve HAD to be<br/>\norganized because I am NOT.....I keep a calendar, but get distracted during<br/>\nthe day and forget things....I do OK with morning activities, but by<br/>\nevening, I&#39;m lost again!  This hasn&#39;t always been a problem for me, but has<br/>\nbeen getting worse the last few years!)  If my kids are not organized, the<br/>\nconsequences are that they don&#39;t get to do that activity/event.  It&#39;s not<br/>\ncontrived....it&#39;s just a fact.  They also have several regular &quot;chores&quot;<br/>\naround the house that need to be done and most all of them have direct<br/>\nconsequences to them if they are not organized enough to get them done.<br/>\n(They do their own laundry--no clean clothes, feed their pets--or they die,<br/>\ntake turns unloading the dishwasher--or your sibling, whose turn it is<br/>\ntomorrow, nags you, clean their newly-pierced ears--or they close, take the<br/>\nnew puppy out to pee--or he messes in their bedrooms, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re part of my daily life--they know what tools I use to stay organized<br/>\nand what happens when I get disorganized.  They are very organized about<br/>\nwhatever&#39;s important to them.  I know they *can* be organized if they want<br/>\nto....if it is important enough to them.  They&#39;re not organized about<br/>\n*everything* in their lives, but they are a lot more responsible and<br/>\norganized than most kids their age...and, in fact, all 3 of them are<br/>\ngenerally more organized than I am.  They also have gone to work with their<br/>\ndad from time to time and have visited his office frequently....they see how<br/>\nPRISTINE his desk is (and how SLOPPY my home desk is!)  He is, luckily, very<br/>\norganized at home, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause organizing is a challenge for me, we do talk semi-regularly about<br/>\n*different* ways to do it.  We talk about whatever their organizing<br/>\nchallenges are and discuss different ways they might improve it.  We also<br/>\ndiscuss MY organizing challenges and different ways we can improve<br/>\nit....since almost every time I&#39;m disorganized, their activities suffer,<br/>\ntoo.  In our house, it hasn&#39;t been something we&#39;ve discussed, implemented a<br/>\nsolution, and never had to deal with again....it&#39;s very much an ongoing<br/>\nprocess!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think this is an important skill to learn, you can discuss that with<br/>\nyour children and explain your reasoning.  You can ask them what they think;<br/>\nask them how *they* organize things in their life currently--what works for<br/>\nthem and what doesn&#39;t.  You can tell them that you will be happy to help<br/>\nthem figure out what works for *them* so that things will be easier in their<br/>\nlives.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat, I get the idea that you&#39;re a very organized person.  Setting goals,<br/>\nmaking to-do lists and checking things off that list are probably pretty<br/>\nimportant to you.  But people can be organized in different ways....and even<br/>\ndisorganized people can be successful.  The most successful pay someone ELSE<br/>\nto organize things for them!  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, now I have to wrap up--Survivor is on.  I know because it&#39;s on my<br/>\ncalendar....  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--Leslie Moyer / Oklahoma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84135975,"authorName":"Pat Cald...","from":"&quot;Pat Cald...&quot; &lt;homeschoolmd@...&gt;","profile":"homeschoolmd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Organization","postDate":"1010684769","msgId":30947,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjUwMWMxOTlmZSRiMDRjMDcwMCQwMjAxYThjMEBkZXNrdG9wPg==","referencesHeader":"PGExajFvYStodnE3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30964,"prevInTime":30946,"nextInTime":30948,"topicId":30947,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have another question for everyone.

In my observation of adults, and through my own journey to grow-up (as an adult) I see that being organized is a learned skill.  I realize some people are more naturally organized and this will come more easily to them, however if being organized is a desired skill, and I feel it is, then everyone will need to make an effort to learn the skill at some point.  So this is what I am struggling with, I thought I would have my girls tell me what they want to do each day and I would write it down as their to-do list, or they could write it down.  I would ask about when they thought they would do x or y and write that down too.  The next day, I would go over whether they did what they wanted or not and continue the process.  To do or not to do the things on their list is not the point, giving thought to the day and seeing what was done or not done the next day can be a learning experience.  My 10 yo dd (who likes a little structure) enjoys the process.  My 12 yo dd doesn&#39;t want any part of it.  I see my options as explaining the reason for doing what we are doing and asking if that is a good reason and hopefully getting some cooperation or just letting it drop with the older one and letting her make the long journey on her own with all its inherent difficulties.  Ps children learn to be organized to succeed at school (I know many don&#39;t).  Without the need to be organized at home, this skill may be under developed by the time it is needed for college or a job.  What do you all do to help develop organization skills?<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30501,"nextTopicId":31023}}
