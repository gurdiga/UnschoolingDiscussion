I don&#39;t<br/>\neven mean to imply that a child has to come up with the idea, most certainly<br/>\nunschooling moms come up with great ideas to interest their kids (today we<br/>\nlearned how to shear goats at my suggestion!!).  The difference is in<br/>\nwhether the activity is required.  I might suggest making cookies or going<br/>\nshopping or to the zoo, the kids are free to agree or decline.
