That way your <br/>\n  &gt; children will obey you in public, and people will marvel at your well <br/>\n  &gt; behaved children: <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  Yeah, that sounds typcical .. I remember one time hearing that one should <br/>\n  &quot;look for opportunities throughout the day to thwart the will of your child&quot;  <br/>\n  ( this was for infants and toddlers!!)    Anna was here reading over my <br/>\n  shoulder.. She read the excerpt from the text that was posted.  She was <br/>\n  appalled..  She said. &quot;Moma, thats like training a dog&quot;  She went on to <br/>\n  compare it to Landon training Joy( our Lab).. to  sit, stay, OFF, Down, NO.. <br/>\n  etc..  Anna even felt bad for Joy when Landon trained her to heel by yanking <br/>\n  on her leash.    I&#39;m glad that my kids have never had to be &quot;trained&quot; like <br/>\n  dogs.  ( despite that we live in the Bible Belt.. lol)   I have spanked my <br/>\n  kids.. But, it was out of anger, frustration, and on impulse.( just like <br/>\n  someone else commented. again, cant recall who)  I never felt worse than <br/>\n  after those incidents.   I attribute those misjudgings to immaturity, and <br/>\n  just not having  the skills to know what else to do.  I havent spanked in a <br/>\n  long time.     The advice to never spank is anger has always been good for <br/>\n  me.. Because, it never fails, after my anger calms, I wouldnt dream of <br/>\n  spanking my children. ( thats how I have avoided spanking them since I <br/>\n  &quot;stopped&quot;)  My anger scared me ( and them, of course).so I vowed to never <br/>\n  spank in anger.. Well, when the anger was gone, so was the impulse to spank.  <br/>\n  I agree, doing it in calm, calculated way seems even more &quot;cold blooded&quot;.   <br/>\n  And the &quot;training exercises&quot;. thats just plain stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Teresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
