I have smoked, drank, bit my nails, picked at scabs, bit my <br/>\nlips, etc. For me they are nervous &#39;self-picking&#39; habits I acquired from <br/>\nchildhood. I grew up in a very critical environment, not knowing where the <br/>\nnext criticism might come from, and never feeling safe to just relax and be <br/>\nmyself and know that all would be well. When I do these things now, I&#39;m <br/>\nfeeling tense, unsure of myself, not liking myself, not trusting or loving <br/>\nmyself, and sometimes from having been around others who are judging and <br/>\ncriticizing me. For me, the cure isn&#39;t to just force myself to stop (which <br/>\nbtw usually sends me to just redirect it into another habit), but to change <br/>\nat a deeper level. This is why I believe that telling someone, &#39;you&#39;re doing <br/>\nthis, it&#39;s causing this and you need to stop&#39; is ineffective. I know that <br/>\npicking at my nails til they bleed is wrong and hurts me, but finding out <br/>\n&#39;why&#39; I do it and trying to comfort the need to do it is more effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nP.s.

To bite <br/>\nmy lip when I want to tell my son he&#39;s doing it wrong or going the wrong <br/>\ndirection. To stop my hand when I want to put it in his project to shape it <br/>\nto what I &#39;know&#39; is better. To offer any and all truth, information and <br/>\nknowledge to him when he asks for it. This, to me, is based on the basic <br/>\nbelief that if a person is given the room, opportunity and support to grow <br/>\nand learn, he/she will naturally want to grow, learn and change to improve <br/>\nand further his/her life. If I, as an adult, personally trust in myself, I <br/>\ncan get life-changing ideas from experts, amateurs, ants, sesame street, etc. <br/>\nLearning is endless. But if I feel like someone or something outside of <br/>\nmyself has all the &#39;right&#39; answers, my growth may depend on that source.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, allowing this freedom is to respect my son in his own growth and <br/>\nprocess. I would like to extend that respect to everyone that I interact <br/>\nwith. I think the philosophy that someone may not know if it I don&#39;t tell <br/>\nthem is arrogant and flawed. If I have a truth, and someone wants it, it&#39;s <br/>\nwrong imo to withhold it. But if I have a truth, and I want someone else to <br/>\nhave it when they didn&#39;t ask, it&#39;s arrogant and controlling. And it&#39;s <br/>\nassuming that without the great wise and powerful &#39;me&#39;, they wouldn&#39;t get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the &#39;tell it like it is&#39; philosophy is great, when someone is asking <br/>\nfor it.  When I want someone to tell me straight out, I ask straight out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just spouting some thoughts here.  I just don&#39;t understand why we respect <br/>\nour kids to do the right thing for themselves if we encourage them to trust <br/>\nthemselves and provide access to everything, but in relating to other adults, <br/>\nwe need to tell someone who didn&#39;t ask that they&#39;re doing it wrong because <br/>\notherwise they might never know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is a balance between sickly sweet and cold hard truth. I also <br/>\nthink that just because someone knows a lot about a certain topic, such as <br/>\nunschooling, doesn&#39;t mean that they know the best way to convey new ideas to <br/>\npeople. Or the best way to introduce wholly different lifestyles to someone <br/>\nwithout insulting their ability to think for themselves or trust themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned a lot about the human body, massage, movement and nutrition.  <br/>\nBut it took me awhile (and I&#39;m still learning) to realize that just pushing <br/>\nthis truth onto everyone isn&#39;t always effective. And many counselors I&#39;ve <br/>\ntalked to have told me that there is a definite process to self change, and <br/>\nto rush that process is damaging. To just walk up and tell someone that <br/>\nthey&#39;re repeating a self defeating habit and here&#39;s what they need to do <br/>\ndifferent, when they didn&#39;t ask and most likely aren&#39;t ready, can be more <br/>\nharmful than good. It can cause defensiveness and loss of self trust and may <br/>\neven cause them cling even stronger to the self defeating behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was Rumi who said &#39;Follow people who are searching for the truth, <br/>\nrun from those who have found it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26465,"nextTopicId":26529}}
