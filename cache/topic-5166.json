Some people think it&#39;s the best<br/>\nthing they ever found. Others feel like they charge an awful lot (about<br/>\n$550 per year) for what they do. I think it depends on whether you feel<br/>\nlike you need this kind of cover. It actually is a school - not a legal<br/>\ndefense association like H$LDA. Clonlara states that they will help you<br/>\nby testifying in court if you need them too, but they don&#39;t offer<br/>\nlawyers, etc. That said, I would much prefer my money go to an org. like<br/>\nClonlara than H$LDA, but I&#39;d rather not spend the money on either. <br/>\nDiane in KS &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n$~~~~~~~~~~&lt;O~~****~~O&gt;~~~~~~~~~~$<br/>\nRobin&#39;s Nest <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.myfreeoffice.com/leuenberger/index.html\">http://www.myfreeoffice.com/leuenberger/index.html</a>   <br/>\n$~~~~~~~~~~&lt;O~~****~~O&gt;~~~~~~~~~~$<br/>\nSuggested Prayers for B&#39;nai Noah:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.myfreeoffice.com/leuenberger/prayers.html\">http://www.myfreeoffice.com/leuenberger/prayers.html</a><br/>\n$~~~~~~~~~~&lt;O~~****~~O&gt;~~~~~~~~~~$</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5139,"nextTopicId":5168}}
