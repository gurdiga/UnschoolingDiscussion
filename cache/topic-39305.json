My daughter is now 17,  we have only homeschooled her for the last 2 and a half years.  She was in PS and met this guy a year older and she said in love w/, well they both got into some troble w/ the law.  She has learned to deal with what has come.  I feel that she is a better person because of it and whatever happens in the future I stand behind her, because it is her life and she has learned from mistakes.
