This list does help a<br/>\nlot, but I&#39;m also seeking people to spend time with who are pondering<br/>\nthese issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nSooo, I guess I was hoping for a few unschoolers who met at the park once<br/>\nin awhile... =^..^=<br/>\n<br/>\nNext time we head over the pass I&#39;ll let you know.  It&#39;d be nice to meet<br/>\nand really cool if there were others in the area!  We are planning to go<br/>\nto the Titanic exhibit at Seattle Center, maybe in May.  Which parks do<br/>\nyou like to go to in Tacoma?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a GREAT friend in Tacoma, but she is now a teacher, aaaaggghhhh! <br/>\nWe are still good friends, but it&#39;s a challenge when there is a major<br/>\ndifference in child-rearing ideas.  Our daughters are the same age and we<br/>\nmet when they were newborns.  Also, it&#39;s tough to find time to get<br/>\ntogether because her dd keeps school hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking about starting an unschooling &quot;un group&quot; locally.  Just<br/>\ngiving it a name and listing it in the newspaper support groups and clubs<br/>\nlisting, maybe the library too.  Trying to find out if there are any<br/>\nother unschoolers around here.  It&#39;s quite possible that there are other<br/>\nunschoolers, but they haven&#39;t felt any need to join a homeschooling<br/>\ngroup.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do feel lucky to be part of an eclectic homeschooling group.  Members<br/>\nare very accepting of the variety of approaches that other members use. <br/>\nThere have been a variety of events through the group, but my favorites<br/>\nare the park days and play days, where we can just get together without<br/>\nan agenda.  There are a couple of unschoolers, but they are losing faith<br/>\nthat this approach will work as their kids get older and are requiring<br/>\nsome academics.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nMarch is National Nutrition Month<br/>\nDid you eat your 5 today?<br/>\n(fruits and vegetables, that is!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***&quot;Organized unschooling group&quot;? &lt;gales of laughter&gt; Mary Ellen, I&#39;m<br/>\nafraid<br/>\n*this* is the only kind of unschooling group I have...here on line. It<br/>\nwould<br/>\nbe fun to get together, though. Perhaps you and I could offer (on-line)<br/>\nto<br/>\nhost an unschooling picnic sometime?<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m driving through Gig Harbor tomorrow, as a matter of fact. :)<br/>\n <br/>\nValerie in Tacoma</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17163,"nextTopicId":17165}}
