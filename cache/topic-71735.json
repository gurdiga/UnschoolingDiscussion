I spend a lot of time backpacking and camping<br/>\nand the areas are always the worst just after hunting season is over. I<br/>\ncan&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve gone to a campground and found deer legs<br/>\nand guts hanging out on the ground, trashcans not used or overflowing<br/>\neverywhere, the pit toilets crammed with garbage, etc.  Even worse in the<br/>\nwilderness, where at least most backpackers will take out what they brought<br/>\nin. After awhile, we learned just not to go right after hunting season, give<br/>\nthe campgrounds a few weeks to get cleaned up.<br/>\nOne year while I was backpacking, we made camp after it got dark and had<br/>\nsevere bear problems during the night in our camp. Turns out that hunters<br/>\nhad used that same camping spot and had left deer legs and blood everywhere,<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t see it until morning. Now I&#39;m very careful to check out camping<br/>\nspots before setting up my tent!<br/>\n<br/>\nI come from a hunting family, and my grandpa bagged an elk most years. But<br/>\nhe and his buddies also took a ton of beer and cans of food and I sincerely<br/>\ndoubt that they left their camping areas cleaner than they found them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] hunting","postDate":"1054496142","msgId":71739,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Yi4xZmUwMWYzNS4yYzBiYWY4ZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71736,"nextInTopic":71767,"prevInTime":71738,"nextInTime":71740,"topicId":71735,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/1/03 1:09:12 PM, abtleo@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-334055685\">In a message dated 6/1/03 1:09:12 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abtleo@...\">abtleo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I know you made several good points in your post, but this one bothered me.<br/>\nI lived in Montana for a while and had friends that hunted, and worked two<br/>\nsummers in Glacier National Park before that, spending lots of time in the<br/>\nwoods.    <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;This isn&#39;t true.

They were from before the <br/>\ndepression, and some Americans seemed to take pride in disposable bottles and <br/>\nother signs of decadent plenty.

Piles of trash a hundred years before tended to <br/>\ndecompose better than modern trash does.  Leaving cold campfires with <br/>\nhalf-melted glass and cans didn&#39;t bother some of my parents&#39; generation.  They never <br/>\nleft them hot, but leaving them instead of taking them apart seemed a courtesy to <br/>\nthe next campers.
