Makes me mad just to think of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut let me give you the real life background.  This mom had a still-born<br/>\nchild that she still grieved over who would have been older than this child.<br/>\nThe mom felt guilty that perhaps she could have done something different so<br/>\nthat the baby would hav lived.  She played soccer as a stress-reliever for<br/>\nherself and had injured her ankle the day before and was limping along.  The<br/>\nmom and little girl were walking alone toward the parking lot where their<br/>\ncar was when the little girl took off running.  The mom called for her to<br/>\ncome back, to wait for her, to stop, etc. and the little girl laughed and<br/>\nkept running.  The mom was hobbling as fast as she could trying to catch the<br/>\nchild.  The mom felt more and more panic rising in her chest as she watched<br/>\nher dd getting closer and closer to the parking lot of cars.  She finally<br/>\ncaught her right at the curb, grabbing her by the arm and giving her a swat.<br/>\nThe mom cried on the way home thinking of what she had done.  Later, she<br/>\napologized to her daughter.  The mom felt so sad that she talked to me about<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas the spanking &quot;called for&quot;?  no.  Did it make her a bad mother? no.<br/>\nWould a stranger upbraiding this mom be helpful?  probably not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know people&#39;s past colors how they see things.  I have never been abused<br/>\nand perhaps that is why I see the above scenario happening much more often<br/>\nthan the woman who calls her kids names or pulls their hair when they don&#39;t<br/>\nmind her immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I think parents SHOULD feel bad when they hurt their children.

But to take it a step farther....what is an acceptable<br/>\nform of punishment?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were foster parents, we often had small children living with us who<br/>\nhad no clue how to treat people or how to expect others to treat them.  We<br/>\nwere told over and over to use time-out.

She was 5 for gosh<br/>\n&gt;   sakes.  I<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   had<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   children of my own and couldn&#39;t imagine not being able to handle<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt;   5yo.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Then David came to live with us when we were foster parents.<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n&gt;   was<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   3<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   and actively psychotic.  He threw fits almost non-stop, kept<br/>\n&gt;   forgetting<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   about the dog and screaming his head off every time he saw it,<br/>\nwould<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   attack<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   other children for no apparent reason, didn&#39;t sleep at all that<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt;   could<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   tell.

A mother of 2 who had been trained for 6 years in<br/>\nchild<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   psychology and had 10 years experience as a therapist couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;   handle a<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   3 yo<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   boy.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   That was when I quit judging the parenting techniques of other<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   parents...at<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   least the ones I didn&#39;t know.

Yes.  Do I think there are parents that have tried<br/>\ntalking,<br/>\n&gt;   tried<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   removing from the situation, tried distracting and then finally<br/>\n&gt;   spanked<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   because they didn&#39;t know what else to do?

I was raised with the<br/>\nspanking philosophy, so at times I did resort to<br/>\nspanking my kids, because that is what you&#39;re<br/>\n&quot;supposed to do&quot;.  <br/>\nHowever, while reading I had a odd remembrance from my<br/>\nyouth. I was 7 and my mom (divorced) was leaving me<br/>\nand my 8 yo sister with a babysitter (21 yr old male)<br/>\nso she could go pick up something from her work. I<br/>\nthrew a fit because we were being left (or so that is<br/>\nwhat my mom thought). I was spanked probably 5-6<br/>\ndifferent times in a 15 min span -- would get taken to<br/>\nmy room, spanked, then would run outside to try to<br/>\nstop her from leaving us, then the process would<br/>\nrepeat itself. She never stopped to find out why I was<br/>\nacting that way and I wasn&#39;t prone to acting out.<br/>\nEventually, she just up and drove away with me<br/>\nstanding in the front yard screaming at her to stop.<br/>\nActually, what was happening was the babysitter was<br/>\nsexually molesting my 8 yo sister, and had taken us<br/>\nboth with him to break into a couple houses while he<br/>\nwas &quot;watching&quot; us. I didn&#39;t want my sister to be hurt,<br/>\nso I was attempting to get us taken with her instead<br/>\nof being left. I guess she didn&#39;t talk much to us,<br/>\nbecause she wouldn&#39;t listen.<br/>\nSo... I hadn&#39;t thought of that in years, but it<br/>\ndefinitely is a good reason to listen to your kids,<br/>\nespecially if the behavior they are showing isn&#39;t<br/>\nnormal for them. <br/>\nI really have never thought about the fact that you<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to spank. Your discussions have a way of<br/>\nmaking people think twice about long held &quot;traditions&quot;<br/>\npassed down by parents and not passing them down to<br/>\nyour kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoberta<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

She was 5 for gosh sakes.<br/>\nI had<br/>\n&gt;     children of my own and couldn&#39;t imagine not being able to handle a<br/>\n5yo.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Then David came to live with us when we were foster parents.  David<br/>\nwas 3<br/>\n&gt;     and actively psychotic.  He threw fits almost non-stop, kept<br/>\nforgetting<br/>\n&gt;     about the dog and screaming his head off every time he saw it, would<br/>\nattack<br/>\n&gt;     other children for no apparent reason, didn&#39;t sleep at all that I<br/>\ncould<br/>\n&gt;     tell.  After 6 days, I asked for him to be moved because I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nhandle<br/>\n&gt;     that kid.  A mother of 2 who had been trained for 6 years in child<br/>\n&gt;     psychology and had 10 years experience as a therapist couldn&#39;t handle<br/>\na 3 yo<br/>\n&gt;     boy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     That was when I quit judging the parenting techniques of other<br/>\nparents...at<br/>\n&gt;     least the ones I didn&#39;t know.

Yes.  Do I think there are parents that have tried talking,<br/>\ntried<br/>\n&gt;     removing from the situation, tried distracting and then finally<br/>\nspanked<br/>\n&gt;     because they didn&#39;t know what else to do?

I think we all have beliefs and there is a big difference between judging and sharing our beliefs. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf nobody ever shared that there is an alternative to spanking, many moms might never know it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Have a Nice Day! <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, March 18, 2004 3:29 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] voicing your opinion?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thank you for saying that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As much as I strive to do better, there are times when I reach a point and don&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t believe in spanking, but my kids are familiar enough with it to know what it means.

She was 5 for gosh sakes.  I had<br/>\nchildren of my own and couldn&#39;t imagine not being able to handle a 5yo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen David came to live with us when we were foster parents.  David was 3<br/>\nand actively psychotic.  He threw fits almost non-stop, kept forgetting<br/>\nabout the dog and screaming his head off every time he saw it, would attack<br/>\nother children for no apparent reason, didn&#39;t sleep at all that I could<br/>\ntell.  After 6 days, I asked for him to be moved because I couldn&#39;t handle<br/>\nthat kid.  A mother of 2 who had been trained for 6 years in child<br/>\npsychology and had 10 years experience as a therapist couldn&#39;t handle a 3 yo<br/>\nboy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was when I quit judging the parenting techniques of other parents...at<br/>\nleast the ones I didn&#39;t know.  I don&#39;t know the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I think spanking is a good and effective parenting response?  No.  Do I<br/>\nthink time-out is?  No.  Do I think every child is capable of the empathy<br/>\nrequired to make discussions of how our behavior effects others effective?<br/>\nNo.  Do I think there are parents that spank their kids at the drop of a<br/>\nhat?  Yes.  Do I think there are parents that have tried talking, tried<br/>\nremoving from the situation, tried distracting and then finally spanked<br/>\nbecause they didn&#39;t know what else to do?  Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave I spanked my kids?  Yes.  Is it something I would recommend to others?<br/>\nNo.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Brian and Kathy Stamp&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstamp@...\">bstamp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 18, 2004 9:53 AM<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] voicing your opinion?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If you are on another email  list or group and something like spanking<br/>\ncomes up, do you try to voice your concerns or opinions on it?
