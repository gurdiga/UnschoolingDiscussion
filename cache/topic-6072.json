I really enjoying reading<br/>\nwhat others are doing...so,<br/>\nWe started the day very excited because my 7yr old son lost a tooth<br/>\nyesterday, so it was very exciting to find what the tooth fairy had<br/>\nbrought.  It started with a discussion of why she didn&#39;t take the<br/>\ntooth...hee..hee.. (she couldn&#39;t find it!)  Then progressed to how much<br/>\nshe had brought.  We have just started working with cuisinaire rods, so<br/>\nwe pulled them out and counted the money with them.  Was a bit over<br/>\ntheir heads, but I think they caught a gleam now and then.  That was<br/>\nfun.  Then on to more boring things like barn chores and getting dressed<br/>\nect..  After that Mom had to work on HS newsletter, so kids played<br/>\noutside and stopped in to visit Grandma.  Then we read the rest of<br/>\n&quot;Remember My Name&quot;  We are studying the cherokee indians with our<br/>\nhistory book club.  Then discussed more about the trail of tears, and<br/>\nfinished the last few pages about modern cherokee in &quot;If You Lived With<br/>\nThe Cherokee&quot;.  Then Mom had lunch very late, kids played inside<br/>\n(horsey) and then Mom painted their faces like indians.  All had to run<br/>\nup to show Grandma (she lives up our driveway.)  Mom worked more on<br/>\nnewsletter, and son wen to to barn to collect a couple of feathers for<br/>\nMom to put in his hair.  The little peacock feathers looked great!   Dad<br/>\narrived home to painted children with feathers in their hair.  Related<br/>\nall the happenings to him, and played war and match game with him.<br/>\nTonight we had problems with our satellite, so we all took turns<br/>\nsuggesting what to try.  Then caught a great show about Medieval<br/>\nTrebechets.  Way cool!!  We logged on to PBS, and found out more, then<br/>\nplayed the destroy the castle game there...Very fun!!  Played until the<br/>\nkids could knock down the castle themselves, while Mom made chocolate<br/>\npie.  Of course ate chocolate pie and then it was time for bed.  Had a<br/>\ndiscussion about why those men were wearing skirts  (kilts)  LOL  and<br/>\nmade a promise we could play more destroy the castle, and look into<br/>\nbuilding our own trebechet.<br/>\nWHEW!  I&#39;m pooped.  We aren&#39;t always this busy.  Some days, Mom goes to<br/>\nthe gym, and we read, and that&#39;s about it.<br/>\nIn the past week and a half we have made masks, painted them, and now<br/>\nare going to decorate them.  Learned the best ways to sled.  Are looking<br/>\nup science experiments to try, and are starting Miquon math.  Next it&#39;s<br/>\non to Bob books.  Slow and easy.<br/>\nWell, this was way long, but it&#39;s life, and we like it.<br/>\nAnn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6085,"nextTopicId":6122}}
