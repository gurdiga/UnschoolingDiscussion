Even as a <br/>\nbaby she never needed as much sleep as other children. So we do not <br/>\nenforce *bedtime* - she goes when she is ready.  She is usually <br/>\nasleep about 10-10.30pm. Rising about 8 - 8.30am.  She is not a <br/>\nmorning person and lounges around untill about 10am.  It took me a <br/>\nwhile to realize that she is different to me - I am a morning person <br/>\nI do my best work BEFORE 10am...  Our body clocks obviously work <br/>\ndifferently.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaths.  I always loved maths - english and English History.  I loved <br/>\nworking from work books and loved to learn.    My daughter is the <br/>\nopposite.  So when we started H/Sing 5 months ago i expected her to <br/>\nbe like me - my daughter is 11yrs and had attended school for 6yrs - <br/>\nI really did EXPECT her to be so happy not to have to go to school <br/>\n(she was very depressed because she was getting bullied) wrong.  So <br/>\nafter 5months I decided to go along with what people had suggested on <br/>\nthese message boards and unschool - well at the moment we are <br/>\ndeschooling - I am begining to wonder if she is ever going to <br/>\nprogress to unschooling...............<br/>\nMarianne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12081,"nextTopicId":12236}}
