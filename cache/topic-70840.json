My mom didn&#39;t have me until 25, and my dad was<br/>\n32. Her mom was 30 when she started having kids, so I come from a line of<br/>\nrelatively old mothers (especially for back then). My mom told me she<br/>\nthought it was a great idea to get a little of my own life under my belt<br/>\nbefore having kids, and a good idea to wait until age 25 or so. I think it<br/>\nwas good advice (for me at least). I&#39;m always grateful that I got to have a<br/>\nwhole bunch of different experiences, traveling, dating a wide variety of<br/>\npeople, etc. before I met my DH. When I met him, I knew how good he was, and<br/>\nI knew he was the one &quot;keeper&quot; I&#39;d met. So it took us about 2 weeks to<br/>\nfigure out we wanted to get married and have kids (though we did some<br/>\ntraveling and stuff together first). I&#39;m glad I had these experiences<br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m waiting for my kids to grow up so that my<br/>\n&quot;life&quot; can start. There&#39;s nothing I&#39;m missing out on, I know the value of<br/>\nwhat I have (though I&#39;m not saying all younger mothers are itching to get<br/>\naway from motherhood, this is just my experience).<br/>\nDH&#39;s family on the other hand has a new generation about every 16 or 17<br/>\nyears, and I can see the toll that it takes on the children who are being<br/>\nraised by kids who are too immature to be able to devote themselves to being<br/>\nparents. I&#39;ll never forget his niece leaving her 3 week old baby overnight<br/>\nso she could go and party in a town where the drinking age was low enough<br/>\nthat she could get in to bars. These kids just aren&#39;t done growing up, and<br/>\nthey&#39;re not able to care for the babies that they have. In so many cases<br/>\nthese days, the grandparents end up raising the kids, it&#39;s a huge<br/>\nphenomenon.<br/>\nI think there&#39;s a big difference between a 17 year old in a tribal village<br/>\nhaving a baby and having the support of her family and village; and kids in<br/>\nour society who are just entering into a stage of rebelling against school,<br/>\nlife, all the controls in their lives, and using their own reproductive<br/>\ncapability as part of that rebellion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"Heidi","from":"&quot;Heidi&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Young Women Re: rite of passage and adulthood","postDate":"1054043913","msgId":71004,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJhdnF1OStjNGoxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMzMjQxNSQ1MjZiOTA0MCQ1NWJjYTNjZUBrcmlzPg=="},"prevInTopic":70998,"nextInTopic":71012,"prevInTime":71003,"nextInTime":71005,"topicId":70840,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... were ... family ... energy ... young when ...

He never<br/>\nspoke kindly to me.  Although he never actually hit me, the verbal<br/>\nabuse was intense.  I also gained about 80 lbs during this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I FINALLY woke up to my life and realized that I needed to get<br/>\nout, my life changed completely.  I moved back in with grandma for<br/>\nabout 6 months while I worked on crawling out of the hole that I had<br/>\ndug myself into.  I re-gained my self esteem and came out of the<br/>\ndepression and boy what a difference that all made.

We don&#39;t have &quot;villages&quot; anymore to help <br/>\nsupport a young woman taking care of her young baby or the kind of <br/>\nvillage that makes sure the baby is cared for if the mother proves <br/>\nincompetent. A lucky few young teen girls are sane enough and lucky <br/>\nenough to choose a stable partner who can help give them the support and <br/>\nresources they need to parent in ways that a young baby needs and <br/>\ndeserves; statistically this is a very small percent of total teen <br/>\npregnancies. What happens to the rest? The young partner takes off and <br/>\nleaves the young girl to scramble for resources for herself. Society <br/>\nshames her and her child for their &quot;failure&quot;.

Among many animals, males routinely kill offspring that not <br/>\ntheirs. Richard Wrangham explains: &quot;The issue is confused with humans <br/>\nbecause society expects a stepfather to accept a parental role with his <br/>\nspouse&#39;s children, even though he evolutionarily he is a rival to the <br/>\nprevious father.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t something that we usually take a good, hard, honest look at <br/>\nin our society but I am sure it is something that welfare workers, <br/>\nemergency medical personal, and police are all too aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Young Women Re: rite of passage and adulthood","postDate":"1053967150","msgId":70852,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYjgwMWMzMjNhNSQ1NTY3MTFlMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDE3YS4xYjQ2NTQyYS4yYzAzN2M0Y0Bhb2wuY29tPiA8M0VEMjNBOEYuODc1QjY4QTNAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":70847,"nextInTopic":70866,"prevInTime":70851,"nextInTime":70853,"topicId":70840,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: Betsy   It took me","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-628608145\">From: &quot;Betsy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ecsamhill@...\">ecsamhill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Knowing what you need from a relationship and picking the right guy the<br/>\nfirst<br/>\ntime seems unlikely, to me&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took me 32 years to find Mr. Perfect for me.
