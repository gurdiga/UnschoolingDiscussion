At the risk of lingering<br/>\ntoo long on a topic, I will share how it happened for me, which<br/>\nmay help somebody understand what is going on with their own kid.<br/>\nThe Christmas I was 2 1/2, I had a new sister and very little<br/>\npleasure in that fact.  My maternal grandparents came to stay for<br/>\nan extra long holiday visit to help over the bump of<br/>\nsibling-ness.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy grandfather was academic dean of a university, but had started<br/>\nthere when it was a normal school (teacher&#39;s college).  As a<br/>\nresult he had a ton of very cool &quot;Stuff&quot; in his head and on his<br/>\nshelves.  He brought with him several sheets of perforated cards<br/>\nwith pictures, printed in red ink, woodcut style, of all the<br/>\nkings and queens of England, with just their names under the<br/>\npictures.  He taught me all the rules of phonics that Christmas.<br/>\nI remember after that being able to sound out most anything I<br/>\nwanted to, but also that it was HARD - and frequently not worth<br/>\nthe trouble.  I used the skill as needed, to look stuff up and to<br/>\nselect things that had no pictures - in a mill town, a lot of<br/>\nstuff was labeled with petty generic tags at the store.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also remember the Summer I was 7, the absolute smothering sense<br/>\nof panic that I felt when I realized I could no longer look at a<br/>\nword without automatically reading it.  The closest I have ever<br/>\nseen to a similar feeling being described is in people with<br/>\npsychosis who suddenly have voices in their head.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third piece that I have recently picked up is a letter my<br/>\nmaternal grandmother wrote to her sister at Christmas when I was<br/>\n5 1/2, commenting that I would be reading independently very<br/>\nsoon.  She apparently was right, because when I entered first<br/>\ngrade I read all the way through the first reader Alice and Jerry<br/>\nreader that morning (and got into trouble for showing off and<br/>\nskipping ahead - I had a rocky academic life).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut among my most treasured books from my childhood are some of<br/>\nthe &quot;early readers&quot; that my grandfather had collected from<br/>\ntextbook companies over 50 years.  The pictures are still<br/>\nbeautiful to me - and the memory of the joy of reading<br/>\nindependently rises up from those pages whenever I open them.  I<br/>\nwish I still had the cards, too.  I have no idea why or how he<br/>\nknew that that particular sequence of nouns would pick up all the<br/>\nrules of phonics, but it doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to know<br/>\nthat little girls love kings and queens, especially when shared<br/>\nexclusively with a big lapped grandfather.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could defend any of those steps as being the time I learned to<br/>\nread - in a way each one was.  But mainly when I talk about when<br/>\none of ours has started reading (or how), I recall my own<br/>\nmultiyear sequence.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Learning to read","postDate":"1032271076","msgId":44260,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3Ni5lYWIwMmNiLjJhYjg4ZWU0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":44258,"nextInTopic":44276,"prevInTime":44259,"nextInTime":44261,"topicId":22611,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/17/02 6:31:55 AM, myrandab@bellsouth.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1091746299\">In a message dated 9/17/02 6:31:55 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:myrandab@...\">myrandab@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; One of<br/>\n  the few things I didn&#39;t see was any discussion of how folks<br/>\n  themselves had learned to read.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t read when I went to first grade, but I could write my name in <br/>\ncursive, and spell some other words.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in Fort Worth Texas, W.M.

I don&#39;t know where 4yods <br/>\nlearned that S-A-D spells sad (he told me this yesterday), or how 1 <br/>\n1/2yodd learned her letters - the ones she knows - but somehow they <br/>\njust picked it up.  We read a lot, and we have a lot of words around <br/>\nour house.  Our clothes have words on them, food packages have words <br/>\non them, books, of course, and even toys often have words on them.  <br/>\nSometimes they ask what things say.  Yes, we read Dr. Seuss <br/>\nsometimes - ds likes Green Eggs and Ham.  He noticed that certain <br/>\ncolumns of words were the same.  Had I pointed it out, he probably <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have cared, but since he was the one who noticed, he did <br/>\nlearn.  A friend loaned me a book - Teach Your Child to Read in 100 <br/>\nEasy Lessons.  I really wasn&#39;t interested, but I leafed through it, <br/>\nand could hardly believe how arrogant the authors encourage the <br/>\nparent/teacher to be.  But I don&#39;t think other teaching materials are <br/>\nmuch better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; And the last question is re bilingual children. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>     *I find that my children are learning both at the same time.  We <br/>\ndo our best to keep as much Japanese materials around the house as <br/>\nEnglish, and we speak mostly Japanese at home.  They get English from <br/>\neverybody else.  My MIL sent us some Japanese worksheets that my son <br/>\nactually enjoys &lt;gag&gt;, but maybe that&#39;s because he decides when/if <br/>\nand how long he spends on them.  We also have frequent contact with <br/>\nfamily in Japan - we&#39;ll be visiting them this summer, and that <br/>\nhelps.  As long as they see and use both languages as LIVING <br/>\nlanguages (and not just dry rules that nobody in their world really <br/>\nuses), they&#39;ll just pick it up, as they will anything else.  DS also <br/>\nhas a Spanish CD-ROM that he likes to play with, but he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand or speak the language.  To him, it&#39;s not real.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>\nknow anybody who actually speaks or uses Spanish.  To him, it&#39;s just <br/>\na game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelanie in Indiana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Dalene Mactier","from":"&quot;Dalene Mactier&quot; &lt;Mactier@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"_fAVFgWizjCTiNVIe9KUUCC6jTppMfd2W8IlZi8NBFTgAmx_lUMrAMzOBsGqtPeSfGJNowTKrVKhUOOM6v0dmFMIKNTUQ2MHY13dWNw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Learning to read","postDate":"992472935","msgId":22611,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYTgwMWMwZjQ1YyQxM2FkY2RlMCRjMTQyMzZkMkBocHBhdj4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22612,"prevInTime":22610,"nextInTime":22612,"topicId":22611,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All I have a few questions regarding introducing letters and learning to read.
