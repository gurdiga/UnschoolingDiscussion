So at about 6, I made my first &quot;quilt&quot;<br/>\n  for one of my dolls - from leftover scraps of the quilt she <br/>\n  was working on.  I have a number of quilts that she made and<br/>\n  I consider them family heirlooms - even one is really in bad<br/>\n  shape.  When she was no longer able to make quilts, I made<br/>\n  one for each of my niece and nephews as baby gifts!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I do mostly machine now - Grandma thought machine was not as<br/>\n  good but if I want to get anything done ....<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have taken 3 art quilt retreats in the past 3 years - they are<br/>\n  held at a local store so I don&#39;t have to leave my family!  DH takes<br/>\n  off the 3 workdays to stay with our children.  I knew he was the <br/>\n  one for me when for a birthday present the first birthday we were<br/>\n  together, he took me to a fabric store and said &quot;buy!&quot;  We bought so<br/>\n  much fabric on our honeymoon (in Hawaii) that we shipped it home since<br/>\n  we didn&#39;t have space in our suitcases for it all.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Right now a lot of my focus in on making things for my children.  This<br/>\n  past winter I started a wall hanging which uses images my daughter drew<br/>\n  for me.  She also told me what she wants on a bed quilt.  My son listed<br/>\n  the transportation vehicles he wants on his!  I&#39;m a fairly non-traditional<br/>\n  quilter and I like the creativity of making my own patterns.  I also<br/>\n  dye or paint fabric since then I&#39;m not limited to the colors in the<br/>\n  local store!  I&#39;m sure I will involve them more as they get older.<br/>\n  They have depths of creativity that amazes me - and it&#39;s great to<br/>\n  work on projects together!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am also trying to organize my stash.  We used a lot of it as packing<br/>\n  material when we moved in the fall so it is jumbled now.  I have a lot<br/>\n  of &quot;help&quot; since Megan and Alex like to get some out and run around the<br/>\n  house with it!<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is a passion for me but I want to keep it a hobby.  At the retreat<br/>\n  I go to about half of us are hobbyists while others do shows and sell<br/>\n  their work.  At this point in my life I want it to stay a hobby.  My<br/>\n  children are more important to me than the extra money or the praise<br/>\n  of a fickle art world!<br/>\n<br/>\n  There&#39;s a lot of math skills in quilting (tie in to homeschooling!)<br/>\n<br/>\n  -- <br/>\n<br/>\n  Cindy Ferguson<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Then last October, she moved to the Midwest to be near us (that was a miracle in itself), and now lives four blocks away. By December, I was full swing into quilting!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nAt this time, I have finished quilt #1, putting the binding on quilt #2, sewing the backing on #3, making blocks for #&#39;s 4 and 5, planning #6 and #7 and buying fabric for all the ones I want to make!!! My mother-in-law says I already have a quilter&#39;s heart....I have been &quot;collecting&quot; fabric for years, thinking I would do something else with it, but not really knowing what...guess I was destined to become a quilter! And I&#39;m a machine quilter---don&#39;t have time to hand quilt, but my mil loves to hand quilt (she does both) and keeps insisting that I do it. I&#39;ll have plenty of time when the kids are grown, that is, if I&#39;m not busy playing with my grandkids! <br/>\n<br/>\nGot to tell you something else really cool---at Home Depot, you know how there&#39;s the &quot;some-assembly-required&quot; type closet organizers, namely Mill&#39;s Pride? If you don&#39;t go to Home Depot often or have never been, I&#39;d suggest you go, because I have found the neatest item, just for storing fabric! Okay, it&#39;s not really intended for fabric, but it is just perfect for fat quarters....it&#39;s a shoe rack! It has 24 little cubbyholes! The Home Depot employee that loaded the boxes onto my rolling cart-thingy thought I had lost my mind! He told one of the other employees that it was to hold my yarn. Of course, I corrected him--how dare he!?! (c;<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought one, and my mother-in-law bought two and some extra shelves. My husband mounted the shelves between the two shoe racks along the back wall of her sewing room. She&#39;s actually organized with places for FQs and extra yards folded on the shelves!! I&#39;m still working on it, but then again, she&#39;s been collecting fabric for 20 years!! I&#39;d say she&#39;s got a bit more than me!<br/>\n<br/>\nGosh, had no intention of babbling on--see what you started!?! Just get me started on my favorite subject and watch out!! <br/>\n<br/>\nTerri <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Johanna <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, May 27, 2001 5:21 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] quilting(was used books)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  or too many colors, or shades of colors.
