They are the trucks that carry what&#39;s in our heads to other<br/>\npeople&#39;s heads. If we use the wrong words, the message doesn&#39;t get<br/>\ntransfered.

Where *are* all these selfish teachers you keep harping about? I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever met any.

In<br/>\nfact I&#39;d bet you&#39;re *causing* a lot of angry responses in otherwise<br/>\nreasonable teachers. It&#39;s becoming self-fulfilling.<br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago on Phil Donahue there was an exotic dancer/model/stripper or<br/>\nsomesuch with enormous breasts. Her breasts were basically her career. And<br/>\nshe had nothing nice to say about men. She&#39;d been raped 11 times or<br/>\nsomething like that and was firmly convinced that every single man was just<br/>\ninches away from dumping wife and family for a chance to get his hands on<br/>\nher. She just wasn&#39;t in a position to see that her career wasn&#39;t going to<br/>\ndraw the good men to her, only the lowest element.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools are bad enough without exaggerating and falsifying what&#39;s going on.<br/>\nWe can help people understand why school feels so right and attractive<br/>\nwithout blasting them with opinions that don&#39;t match their reality. I&#39;d bet<br/>\nthe scare tactics are only effective on people burned by the system who are<br/>\nlooking for someone who shares their anger. It&#39;s going to shut the ears of<br/>\nmost everyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is for everyone drawn to more natural ways of learning, not just<br/>\nthose who hate school. In fact hating school shouldn&#39;t be a reason for<br/>\nunschooling. Though it&#39;s a good reason for homeschooling. But how someone<br/>\ngoes about homeschooling should be based on their kids, not on their anger.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":45073,"authorName":"amycats2@aol.com","from":"amycats2@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:2265 re: &quot;great phrases&quot;","postDate":"1029911034","msgId":41628,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNhLmZmNjU2Y2QuMmE5NDhiZmFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":41623,"nextInTopic":41634,"prevInTime":41627,"nextInTime":41629,"topicId":41612,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/20/2002 10:50:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
