I am still too schooled and hate seeing those<br/>\nreport cards and dittoes they look so boring you are right though it can be<br/>\nfun and full of patterns and rhythm etc. But maybe for some people it will<br/>\nnever be fun and how do you determine what needs to be learned in Math?

I used to love<br/>\nto teach with a number chart we made as a group so we would be able to<br/>\nrecord the number of days we were in school and we also did the counting by<br/>\n2&#39;s , 5&#39;s,10&#39;s etc. counting backwards from a hundred and blasting off into<br/>\nspace..
