Is it possible he is looking for more<br/>\nstructure FROM you because he feels so out of cantrol and doesn&#39;t know<br/>\nhow to get back in control?  I mean most of what you said is really out<br/>\nof his control, maybe he feels like he can&#39;t do anything right now<br/>\nwithout help.  If that is the case, maybe you just need to set a few<br/>\nschedules for the family and he would be okay.  <br/>\nIt does not sound like he wants help with WHAT to study.  You seem to be<br/>\nsaying his problem is in the when and if to study realm.  At the risk of<br/>\ngetting jumped here yet again, maybe what you need to do is make up a<br/>\nlist of what are appropriate amounts for a day or week as a guideline,<br/>\nwhich is what we did here.  If you discuss with him while making up the<br/>\nlist, he will feel a part of the process without having to feel sole<br/>\nresponsibility for it.  <br/>\nIf he really is asking for help choosing WHAT to study, I can&#39;t help much<br/>\nas I&#39;ve never really had to face that.  My girls heve NEVER wanted help<br/>\nwith the &#39;what&#39;!!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\nps - One other thing - tell him IQ tests are meaningless in the real<br/>\nworld.  He should not let a good score make him feel superior in<br/>\nintellect because all that test tested was one little type of thought<br/>\nprocess.  It can not test how well he knows literature, or if he<br/>\nunderstands the internal combustion engine well enough to fix it, or how<br/>\nwell he can play the piano, or how good he is at building furniture, or<br/>\nwhether he understands the concepts that rule our physical universe.  My<br/>\ndh and I both score really well on IQ tests (usually in the MENSA level).<br/>\n And neither of us thinks they are worthwhile.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOO  oo  00   oo   OO   00   oo  OO  oo  00  oo   OO  00  oo  OO  oo  00  <br/>\noo  OO  00  oo <br/>\nAnd the Geezer says:<br/>\n  &quot;Back in my day, &#39;Astral Projection&#39; meant mooning someone!&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"ddzimlew@juno.com","from":"ddzimlew@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"-vcjcuYePjJbXznqfYsGNuntzVjRJzUo6PsXXXuBfU_V29u7tmwXeS9WoooMByOFK8qOfpNLPm4","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] I&#39;d love some help (long)","postDate":"1001802749","msgId":26482,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTI5LjE2MzIzNi4tOTkzNjUuMC5kZHppbWxld0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26480,"nextInTopic":26498,"prevInTime":26481,"nextInTime":26483,"topicId":26471,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t think I understand this completely.( I m slow )  Is he only looking for structure in a few things or a regular sit down - every day - all subject -","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-689612632\">I don&#39;t think I understand this completely.( I&#39;m slow )  Is he only<br/>\nlooking for structure in a few things or a regular sit down - every day -<br/>\nall subject - curriculum?  <br/>\nSince you said he agrees unschooling is still the way to go, I&#39;m thinking<br/>\nit&#39;s just one or two things he&#39;s interested in structuring?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest thought here is, maybe he just wants you with him.  Right<br/>\nthere WITH him as he does - whatever.  If he&#39;s feeling uncertain about<br/>\nlife, maybe it&#39;s not so much a structure thing as it is an assurance<br/>\nthing.  I only bring this up because my own son went through something<br/>\nlike this after the death of his grandfather.  <br/>\nIf this isn&#39;t it, sorry about side tracking. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, if it&#39;s math or English maybe you could look for a math club or a<br/>\nbook club or young writers club that would meet regularly.  Maybe there<br/>\nare some on-line?  Or, what about those unit studies I seem to see<br/>\neverywhere on every topic.  Maybe you could find some on things that<br/>\ninterest him.   My son likes to do the Dell math puzzles and logic<br/>\nproblems that are published like a magazine once a month.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe could get a book of science experiments and work his way through.  Or<br/>\nZoobooks,  they now publish curriculums for certain issues.  Probably<br/>\nafter you look at a few of them you could make up your own. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it Cobblestone that publishes all kinds of magazines for kids?  They<br/>\nare usually available at the library and they are on such topics as<br/>\nsocial studies, culture, science etc.  He could create his own unit<br/>\nstudy.  Yes, they publish Calliope, Faces, Odyssey, and Cobblestone (<br/>\njust found the ad ) They sell these to schools so I bet they have<br/>\ncurriculums for certain issues too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWriting in a journal?  Might have therapeutic qualities too.  <br/>\nI&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m just guessing and thinking here.

I have <br/>\nmy son&#39;s permission to share the following with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are in our fourth year of homeschooling/unschooling. My 12 year old son is <br/>\ngoing through a hard time right now. His father, who is VERY active in his <br/>\nlife, announced this summer he is getting married at the end of October to a <br/>\nwoman he&#39;d known four days. My son, partner and I know her better, as she is <br/>\na close friend of a close friends of ours, and we all actually like her a <br/>\nlot, but my son is still understandably freaked out. It was a long summer in <br/>\nsome ways, with his dad acting like a jerk to all of us, being pissed that we <br/>\nweren&#39;t all delighted for him, blaming, etc. (My son&#39;s dad is one of my best <br/>\nfriends, and we have mostly gotten along forever. He also spends more time <br/>\nwith our son than most dads who live with their kids.) <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has also just hit puberty and is NOT happy about it. It feels like <br/>\nanother thing he&#39;s out of control about. He&#39;s stressed about the World Trade <br/>\nCenter events because even the WORLD seems out of control. In the last year <br/>\nhe lost two beloved pets, and the two left are quite old. His grandmother has <br/>\nan ongoing battle with cancer. You get the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot long ago, Julian expressed interest in doing an IQ test. I asked if he <br/>\nwanted a professional, &quot;official&quot; thing, or just something casual, and he <br/>\nsaid something casual was fine. I happened to find something on the web, <br/>\noffered it, and he did it. I was not surprised to find that he scored <br/>\nextremely high. He was.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out that he&#39;s always thought he was average or possibly slightly below <br/>\nin intelligence. (I had no idea that he believed this about himself. It was <br/>\nsomething he kept pretty carefully hidden.) I think much of this comes from <br/>\nhaving highly motivated friends who also have a certain amount of &quot;attitude&quot; <br/>\nabout their own intelligence, and from some bad early school experiences. <br/>\nThis basically objective information about himself (not so much a number, but <br/>\nthe fact that according to the test he scored higher than 98% of people <br/>\ntaking the test) feels good to him, but is also scary...it makes him have to <br/>\nincorporate new knowledge of himself. (Not only is he not average or a little <br/>\nbelow, but  probably pretty far above. Again, not a surprise to US...but <br/>\ncertainly to HIM.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...we&#39;re trying to help. First, he has asked to see a counselor for a <br/>\nlittle while, and we&#39;re going to do that. Second, he feels that he wants a <br/>\nlittle more structure. We talked about unschooling, and both agreed that we <br/>\nthink continuing to unschool is best...He wants to learn what he wants, in <br/>\nhis own ways...BUT he wants more nudging to do things, more structure, etc.  <br/>\nHe has a problem with self-motivation and wants help. He feels it will help <br/>\nhim feel safer, and like things are less out of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nSO... How does one incorporate more structure into unschooling, at the <br/>\nchild&#39;s request? I am NOT the world&#39;s most structured person anyway, and he <br/>\nhas no idea how he wants it to look. I think ANYTHING coming from me would <br/>\nhelp at this point, because I think he wants to feel taken care of and in <br/>\ncontrol. How do I help find a structure for us that still lets him be in <br/>\ncontrol of his life and learning? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Kathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26537,"nextTopicId":26526}}
