One mother talked <br/>\nabout her daughter, who could basically add, subtract, and multiply (just <br/>\nbarely) at 14.  She could deal with money and with fractions as they came <br/>\nat her.  She decided she wanted a high school diploma and started taking it <br/>\nby correspondance.  They tested her and put her in grade 8 math.  She had <br/>\nnot trouble understanding it and getting good grades in it and subsequent <br/>\ncourses.  In the mother&#39;s words, &quot;So. First 14 years, math largely ignored. <br/>\nNext few months, math learned<br/>\nas needed. No drills. No tears. No fear.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother mother posted with a similar story.  Her son had done a similar <br/>\namount of math up until age 14.  He&#39;s now attending a Sudbury Valley type <br/>\nschool and elected to take a grade 10 math class.

Yet, I find myself <br/>\nthinking that he needs to work on math and writing (his weak <br/>\nareas.)  He struggles with handwriting and has been working on <br/>\nlearning to type.
