Any of you more experienced,<br/>\norganized Mom&#39;s and Dad&#39;s have some tip&#39;s?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis reminds me that I said I would make a new phone list for our group, and <br/>\nthe notes from Thursday&#39;s meetings are in Holly&#39;s little note pad, and we&#39;re <br/>\nleaving for Washington D.C. before the next meeting.   *oh joy!*  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh wait--you said &quot;ORGANIZED&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\nOur group is a few years old and evolved from a play group some La Leche <br/>\nLeague members had had.  We still have two of the original members.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people will come for just a week or month or season.  Don&#39;t take that <br/>\npersonally.  Organizing unschoolers seems to be a bit like herding cats.  The <br/>\nnew unschoolers need to see older unschoolers (not biologically older, but <br/>\non-the-path older), and some of the older unschoolers have the wish to help <br/>\nnewer unschoolers so that they don&#39;t have to struggle and wonder and <br/>\nhit-and-miss as sometimes happened years ago, or as still can happen if <br/>\npeople don&#39;t have encouragement and feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur group (Albuquerque Unschoolers) is just a play group.  We have these <br/>\nrules:  No business meetings, no officers, and no field trips.   This doesn&#39;t <br/>\nkeep me from keeping a phone list, and doesn&#39;t keep people from getting <br/>\ntogether to do things in groups.  The group exists, though, so that the kids <br/>\ncan get together with other unschooled kids.  While that&#39;s happening, the <br/>\nmoms sit and talk.  That&#39;s all.  We don&#39;t usually talk about unschooling, <br/>\nalthough when new families come we&#39;ll certainly answer questions for them, <br/>\nand point out certain kids who might be good to observe or interview if they <br/>\nwant more direct reassurance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m tired of going, but my kids NEED to see their friends, and so I go.  Last <br/>\nwinter we met at my house, and we finally came to the point that I dreaded <br/>\nThursdays and even my kids were hoping for it to end.  We were having as many <br/>\nas twelve families, and the house is big, and not fancy/formal, but still <br/>\nthere was wear and tear (on nerves mostly).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn New Mexico we can meet in a city park at least half the year.  In Alaska, <br/>\nI don&#39;t know what to recommend.  Indoors a bunch of kids get loud and close.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut as to organization, if you have a day, time and place, even if it&#39;s just <br/>\ntwo or three families, you can gather other families up gradually.  We made <br/>\nflyers and put them in the most unschooling-related place in town, a used <br/>\nbookstore called Title Wave owned by a homeschooling family at which lots of <br/>\nhomeschoolers check in occasionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe meet on Thursdays, people bring food to share (snack stuff and drinks) and <br/>\nthe kids play for three or four hours.  Lately we have lots of boys in the 9 <br/>\n- 13 age range--sometimes ten of them.  They played dodgeball this week, and <br/>\npalled around in smaller groups playing Pokemon or talking about video games, <br/>\nand they played with some badminton stuff one mom had brought--making up <br/>\ngames without a net.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, rambling</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1264,"nextTopicId":1271}}
