Nor did it matter. I trust <br/>\nthat he will know what he needs to get on with his life. Its my job <br/>\nto allow the security for him to pursue it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he had just turned 4, he asked me if the batteries in his toy <br/>\nwere working. I was busy in the shower and said I&#39;ll check it out <br/>\nwhen I get out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next thing I knew, the shower got dark, light, dark, light.. and <br/>\nI heard him saying &#39;O-F-F&#39; and &#39;O-N&#39;. He was using this to determine <br/>\non his toy if the &#39;on&#39; button worked, hence he would know if its the <br/>\nbatteries or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeking the answers shows me that I trust children. They <br/>\nwill &#39;necessity is the mother of invention&#39; to get their information. <br/>\nTo get what they need to move on. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow wonderful they are when they aren&#39;t coerced, abused, manipulated <br/>\nor fed guilt and fear. How sad it is when you see the ones that are.<br/>\n<br/>\nk</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33757,"nextTopicId":33747}}
