We just got a response that <br/>\nmakes me wonder whether we need more rules!!   (I&#39;m joking, but yet again, <br/>\nread this:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I haven&#39;t read any messages from the group, my mom<br/>\nmade me sign up for some reason and I belong to enough<br/>\ngroups already. see you later.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think people should be on the list who don&#39;t want to be.   It&#39;s not <br/>\nthat kind of a list.   (ARE there those kinds of lists?  I guess online courses <br/>\nfor high school credit, maybe.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if any of you moms have made a kid sign on this list, please reconsider <br/>\nthe nature of unschooling!  Kids like what they discover on their own, what they <br/>\nchoose on their own.    This kid was &quot;made&quot; to be on this list and so didn&#39;t <br/>\nread any of the posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I have no idea whose kid it was, so nobody needs to jump up and confess.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s just an amusing illustration of some of the things that separate <br/>\nstructured learning (school at or away from home) and unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83428,"nextTopicId":83462}}
