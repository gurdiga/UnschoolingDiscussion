Every day I thank God  because I am soooo glad of our little &quot;mistake&quot;, or I may never have gotten the courage up to have another. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; For the longest time I thought that I wanted 3 children.  Now that I<br/>\n  &gt; have two, I am strongly believing more and more every day that 2 is my<br/>\n  &gt; personal limit.  I love my children with everything in me.  I spend<br/>\n  &gt; practically 24 hours a day with them and I treasure every second (even<br/>\n  &gt; those hard ones).  However, I am realistic.  My children wear me out.<br/>\n  &gt; My children cost A LOT!  There are times with two when I am home alone<br/>\n  &gt; that I cannot physically meet both of their needs.  How would I do this<br/>\n  &gt; with more than what I have?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Yes, I feel the same way about the 2 boys that I have (who are 9 & 11). I am<br/>\n  SO glad to have them and it&#39;s such a wonderful experience watching them grow<br/>\n  up and sharing life with them. BUT, I also know that I would have a hard<br/>\n  time having another one or two or three (yikes!) children. I would become a<br/>\n  physical wreck, I think. I would end up really resenting being a mom and I<br/>\n  think it would take all the joy out of motherhood for me, personally. Having<br/>\n  babies was an awesome experience but NOBODY could talk me into having more.<br/>\n  Sleepless nights, feeling like a zombie, more mouths to feed, diapers,<br/>\n  etc... no thanks, I&#39;m done. I am thankful that those days are behind me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Does that make me a bad, selfish mother? I don&#39;t know but I just really love<br/>\n  and appreciate the life we have right now. Our &quot;little&quot; family unit is just<br/>\n  perfect, IMO. OTOH, if I were to get pregnant by accident at this point, I<br/>\n  *would* embrace my new baby - I just wouldn&#39;t do it if I had a choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt; I love seeing happy and healthy large families.  Those that are<br/>\n  &gt; fulfilled seem SO fulfilled.  I envy them.  I look at them and see<br/>\n  &gt; children that aren&#39;t as demanding as mine and I think that perhaps that<br/>\n  &gt; is HOW their parents were capable of being good parents to the number of<br/>\n  &gt; children in their family.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Me too. When I see a mom with a large family, I truly respect and honor her<br/>\n  for having whatever it takes (that I don&#39;t have) to raise those kids. More<br/>\n  power to her and her husband. It&#39;s a wonderful thing, I&#39;m sure. Just not for<br/>\n  me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Karin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
