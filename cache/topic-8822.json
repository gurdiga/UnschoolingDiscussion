Only with my dh it<br/>\nwas cow milk! Now both my DDs have never drank cow<br/>\nmilk and I watch the cheese and buy organic from my<br/>\nco-op,but he only wanted cow milk for his cereal which<br/>\nhe had everyday. Well my DDs, so well versed now on<br/>\nwhy one should not drink cow milk( we are not baby<br/>\ncows is one!) that one day when we were out of cow<br/>\nmilk he tried the Rice Milk and then said he would use<br/>\nit and we haven&#39;t bought cows milk since! I read once<br/>\nthat it takes three weeks to change a taste habit and<br/>\nits been over three weeks for him and he loves Rice<br/>\nmilk now!<br/>\nJill<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well, I&#39;m married to the original card carrying<br/>\n&gt; skeptic!!!  <br/>\n&gt; (kinda reinforcing his comments) when he would have<br/>\n&gt; a fast food burger and<br/>\n&gt; would be complaining about how sluggish he felt,<br/>\n&gt; kinda gentle reminders. <br/>\n&gt; Then when we had an organic beef burger on homemade<br/>\n&gt; organic rolls, after<br/>\n&gt; dinner he suggested that we go out and do somemore<br/>\n&gt; gardening and I kinda<br/>\n&gt; mentioned that he wasn&#39;t feeling sluggish, &quot;Gee your<br/>\n&gt; full of spit and<br/>\n&gt; vinegar, not like after &quot;x&quot; burgers.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, after a while he jumped on the bandwagon and<br/>\n&gt; is now reading labels<br/>\n&gt; and telling the kidlets all about it (and they very<br/>\n&gt; sensibly nod their head<br/>\n&gt; up and down never letting on that I &quot;brainwashed&quot;<br/>\n&gt; them months ago &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I figured slow was better as it allowed time for<br/>\n&gt; everyone else to adjust<br/>\n&gt; and now, instead of food fights, I have an army of<br/>\n&gt; label readers and folks<br/>\n&gt; chomping on the bit for organic goodies.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lynda<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
