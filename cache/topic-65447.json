I can&#39;t seem to stay caught up on all the <br/>\nposts but figured I would just jump in.<br/>\nI have a ds who just turned 6, a dd almost 4 and a ds of 18 months.  <br/>\nI guess we have been unschooling since our first was born.  I have <br/>\nonly recently discovered how unsupportive everyone can be.  Most <br/>\npeople thought it was great until my oldest got old enough to go <br/>\nto &quot;real school&quot;  It seems many people think self learning is only a <br/>\nsupplement to a &quot;regular education&quot;.  I am not discouraged although <br/>\nI would love to find other unschoolers in my area.  I recently <br/>\nstarted attending monthly playgroups with a local homeschooling <br/>\ngroup but find that the adult conversations usually revolve around <br/>\ncurriculums so I have nothing to offer.  At the first meeting I <br/>\nmentioned that we were unschoolers and got a few polite nods and <br/>\nmore than a few raised eyebrows.  Later a woman whispered to me that <br/>\nshe was interested in learning more about unschooling.  It was <br/>\nobvious that she didn&#39;t want anyone to hear us!  My kids are just so <br/>\nexcited to find friends that they don&#39;t have to wait until after <br/>\nschool to play with so we will continue to go.<br/>\nI&#39;m sure I&#39;ve seen Florida mentioned on this list so just wondering <br/>\nif anyone is near me.  I&#39;m in Palm Beach county.<br/>\nMaggy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65508,"nextTopicId":65064}}
