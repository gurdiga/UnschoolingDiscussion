However<br/>\nrecently I have come across a biggie. I just found out our school<br/>\ndistrict is sending the kids entering 5th grade to the middle school.<br/>\nIt means an extra 2 hours a day for these kids. My youngest would be<br/>\nwith these kids. It seems the elementary schools crowded themselves<br/>\nwhen they started all day kindergarten. <br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine if I hadn&#39;t pulled him last fall I would have done it<br/>\nthis one. BTW  the middle school and high school share a bus out this<br/>\nway.So these 10 yos will be riding a bus with kids as old as 18 ,<br/>\nseems kinda scary. (No offense to anyone who has teenagers) <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen that old yellow bus comes rolling around 6:45 am on the first day<br/>\nof school next year you bet I&#39;ll be holding my boys extra<br/>\nclose!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wonder how many calls I&#39;ll be getting to ask about<br/>\nhomeschooling?? hmmmmm... <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMichele</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105963,"nextTopicId":105948}}
