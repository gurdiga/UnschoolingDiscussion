It doesn&#39;t advocate spanking or anything drastic like that does<br/>\nit? Is it a respectful treatment of children in parenting?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yikes! is all I can say.  I was raised in a scientology family.  I doubt<br/>\nthey have anything to say about spanking, but if your parent is an &quot;auditor&quot;<br/>\nyour questions and statements will all be met with, &quot;Thank you&quot; or &quot;Ok&quot;.  As<br/>\nin, &quot;I hate you, Mom!&quot;  &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother was eventually &quot;excommunicated&quot; (called suppressive to<br/>\nscientology) for disagreeing with L. Ron Hubbard, and my father wasn&#39;t<br/>\nallowed to communicate with her.  I have *nothing* good to say about<br/>\nscientology.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary<br/>\nsaftety deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;  Ben Franklin<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"scientology and unschooling","postDate":"1050175626","msgId":64521,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWMzMDEyOSQ4MGQ3ODI0MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":64598,"prevInTime":64520,"nextInTime":64522,"topicId":64521,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is anyone familiar with scientology and how it relates to parenting children?
