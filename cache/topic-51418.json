Rain broke two bones in her arm today, falling off a scooter<br/>\n&gt;after one of her clogs came off her feet and got under a wheel. I wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;there, although I arrived to pick her up a few minutes after it happened.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It was a miserable afternoon in the ER, although she doesn&#39;t remember<br/>\n&gt;them setting the fracture because she was on Versed, and they were pretty<br/>\n&gt;good about painkillers there. Now she&#39;s home and on Tylenol 3, which<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t seem to be doing much for her. She took 50 mg of benedryl a<br/>\n&gt;couple of years ago after three bee stings and didn&#39;t fall asleep, so I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;thinking she has a pretty high tolerance to stuff. I gave her more than<br/>\n&gt;they said to and she finally fell asleep...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;They put something on her arm that&#39;s not a real cast, and she has to go<br/>\n&gt;in next week for that part. The orthopedic surgeon said that they rarely<br/>\n&gt;put casts on in emergency rooms now because after the swelling goes down<br/>\n&gt;they don&#39;t fit tightly enough. We don&#39;t have any insurance, which sucks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve gone around with her one those clogs for over a year now. I hate<br/>\n&gt;&#39;em, and every time she wears them to go bike riding or stilting or<br/>\n&gt;scootering I try to get her to change to a sneaker type shoe, and she<br/>\n&gt;does... but this was at a friend&#39;s house, and a whole gruop of kids were<br/>\n&gt;messing around outside, and she&#39;s never very careful and she&#39;s frequently<br/>\n&gt;getting hurt. If there&#39;s a group of kids and one gets stung by a bee or<br/>\n&gt;falls out of a boat or falls down a cliff, it&#39;s her... not because she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;clumsy, but because she&#39;s gung-ho on doing everything and not especially<br/>\n&gt;careful. She doesn&#39;t generally mind bumps and bruises... She started<br/>\n&gt;walking a day or two after she turned 8 months old, and it was running,<br/>\n&gt;not walking, and she wasn&#39;t very good at it to start off and I wish she&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;waited a few months.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, I have not said anything to her about wearing the clogs and<br/>\n&gt;scootering, but I can&#39;t help thinking it. I know she doesn&#39;t need me to<br/>\n&gt;say I told you so, but I wish I could have convinced her that this was a<br/>\n&gt;bad idea before this happened. I did try... and I know I need to just let<br/>\n&gt;it go, but I had to say it to someone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, if anyone with broken bones (current or past) has any ideas on how to<br/>\n&gt;help her feel better, or help her manage live one-armed, or medications I<br/>\n&gt;should ask for (I have fioricet for my migaines, which I&#39;m tempted to<br/>\n&gt;give her next time) I&#39;d love to hear them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My mom died a year and a day ago, in a hospital with an IV and monitors<br/>\n&gt;and oxygen prongs in her nose... and Rain and I were both a little<br/>\n&gt;freaked out today when she had all the same stuff (when they reduced the<br/>\n&gt;fracture they had to get her really drugged out - the radius was broken<br/>\n&gt;and also out of place, the ulna was just broken). She mentioned that it<br/>\n&gt;was like grandma... and I knew she wasn&#39;t going to die but it was scary<br/>\n&gt;just the same.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We had planned to go visit another friend this afternoon, and all during<br/>\n&gt;the hours at the ER she told people she was going to her friend Hannah&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;house next, whenever they talked about her going home soon.
