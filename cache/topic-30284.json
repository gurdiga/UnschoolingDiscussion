Instead of offering help emotional help  (yes, she did pay <br/>\nmy hotel bill for a bit while I was homeless) she kept saying that I was <br/>\nhurting my child. Then of course, because of her belief, the rest of <br/>\nfamily offered their discontent with my choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt shook her core that I was willing to do anything to keep my kid out of <br/>\na area being inundated with pesticides.
