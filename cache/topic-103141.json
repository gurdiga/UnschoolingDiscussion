Not a favorite of mine but they had him taking them on a tour of his home. Not just the famous grotto but the whole property. And the whole time I was thinking how much fun my family would have in a house like that!! Of course not the kind of fun he&#39;s having but definitely an unschooling friendly house!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103136,"nextTopicId":103062}}
