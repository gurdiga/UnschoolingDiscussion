He isn&#39;t <br/>\npassionate about grammar,  but he knows that if he&#39;s going to take <br/>\nthe ACT or SAT,  he might have to do some review.  Still,  at 13,  he <br/>\nreaches these conclusions on his own without requirements from me.<br/>\nI think grammar and math drills can be accomplished in very little <br/>\ntime later when children see a need for them.
