In school it was always Mary and <br/>\nthere was only one other Mary in my class. So I was Mary K and she was Mary <br/>\nB. (hey, now I&#39;m a Mary B too) Anyway, when I moved to FL no one ever knew <br/>\nof a Mary Ann. When my husband and I went north to PA to visit my family, he <br/>\nwas shocked to hear everyone refer to me as Mary Ann. It sounds funny to me <br/>\ntoo when my northern relatives call me that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
