It was his first time <br/>\nwatching it. We had such a good time, he noticed so many things about that movie <br/>\nthat I never thought he would get. He  talked to me through the whole movie and I <br/>\nloved him doing it, we really shared it. I would never have thought to do <br/>\nthat before reading at this list, I would have just immersed myself in guilt for <br/>\nwatching the idiot box, but instead we reveled in a shared experienced. <br/>\nOn top of all that, I got to see Kevin Costner&#39;s bare bum again!!!!!!&lt;/Grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy in BC, full of caffeine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85084,"nextTopicId":85197}}
