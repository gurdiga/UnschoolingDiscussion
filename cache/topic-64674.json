An <br/>\nexercise in physics she tells me.  Also Physical Education. She&#39;s running <br/>\nwith the cats when they grab her creations and run off with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe cut up fresh strawberries for tonight&#39;s dessert.  She made whipped cream <br/>\nfrom heavy cream.  That&#39;s some science, liquid to solid. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s working on a scrapbook of her cheerleading season.  She&#39;s going later <br/>\nto pick up developed film from her competition in Myrtle Beach two weeks ago. <br/>\n She wants to know about developing film.  But not today she said.  The sun <br/>\nis shining and it&#39;s time to do something outdoors.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we are off to do something outdoors in the sunshine, which I&#39;ve almost <br/>\nforgotten what it looks like it&#39;s been so long.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Talking About Unschooling","postDate":"1050255267","msgId":64674,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxNGUwMWMzMDFlMyQ2MDhmMTZhMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEyYS4yN2E2ZGMxYS4yYmNhZjU0NUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":64684,"prevInTime":64673,"nextInTime":64675,"topicId":64674,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... any ...
