Three <br/>\n&gt; months is only one season.  And some kids will<br/>\n&gt; change sooner or in different <br/>\n&gt; ways than others.   But if you don&#39;t go that<br/>\n&gt; direction you can never get that <br/>\n&gt; direction and you&#39;ll spend the rest of your life<br/>\n&gt; trying to make people do things <br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t want to do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So if it we somehow could actually know and tell you<br/>\n&gt; it was going to take <br/>\n&gt; five years, would you go back to the old way?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope, never would.  This is really the way I want to<br/>\nsee our family moving.  I was pretty much thinking I<br/>\nhadn&#39;t given it enough time, but I was also thinking<br/>\nthat maybe I was going about it the wrong way as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if there were suggestions as to how to<br/>\napproach the children about helping out without it<br/>\nseeming like I was &quot;telling&quot; them they &quot;have to&quot;.  It<br/>\nis very hard to not have them interpret any request as<br/>\na &quot;have to&quot;, and understanding that it is my fault<br/>\nthey think like that, I still want some help around<br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I said we &quot;dropped assigned chores three months<br/>\nago&quot; I didn&#39;t mean I had just suddenly stopped all<br/>\nassigned chores (like letting go of the rope, as<br/>\nSandra mentioned).  Three months ago was really the<br/>\nend of the slowly letting go which began last summer. <br/>\nMy DH still hasn&#39;t completely let go, especially when<br/>\nthe level of grime reaches beyond his tolerance level;<br/>\nthen he starts barking a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just seems like as I eased up, I also took on the<br/>\njobs so that the same level of clean and tidy was<br/>\nmaintained.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that was deceitful though, to them and to DH.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-One child was overheard by another mom on the<br/>\n&gt; phone to<br/>\n&gt; say to a friend, &quot;oops, I spilled my smoothie all<br/>\n&gt; over<br/>\n&gt; the counter.  Oh well, someone else will clean it<br/>\n&gt; up&quot;.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And did you have a serious talk with that child? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh yes!  I was NOT pleased at the prospect of cleaning<br/>\ndried sticky fruit puree all off the counter.  And the<br/>\nchild did clean it up quite contritely.  Perhaps there<br/>\nwas showing off a bit for the friend on the phone, and<br/>\njust bad timing for the mom to pick up the extension<br/>\nat that moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (And I&#39;d say that to moms too.  Some<br/>\n&gt; moms have done little to no <br/>\n&gt; quiet and sweet cleaning.  They&#39;ve done a lot of<br/>\n&gt; grumbling and muttering <br/>\n&gt; cleaning and then they send their family the bill in<br/>\n&gt; one way or another.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OUCH!  That one hits way close to home! LOL!  I am<br/>\nsure I have &quot;sent them the bill&quot; many times, whether I<br/>\nrealized it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Given that, three months is like an hour. Probably a<br/>\n&gt; happy hour.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;DH doesn&#39;t have faith that this unchoring will<br/>\n&gt; work&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Neither do you, it seems, if you&#39;re tapping your<br/>\n&gt; foot at three months and <br/>\n&gt; saying &quot;When is this going to work?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is something to consider.  Perhaps I don&#39;t have<br/>\nas much confidence as I claim to.  Although I am<br/>\nreally looking for first signs that it is working,<br/>\nrather than a full-blown smoothly running household. <br/>\nUpon reflection I do see some things happening, just<br/>\nwith the oldest, such as the bedroom being picked up<br/>\nor personal laundry being done without being asked.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; But I&#39;m guessing that somehow in some way you gave<br/>\n&gt; your kids a speech and <br/>\n&gt; said &quot;From now on...&quot; and maybe something you said<br/>\n&gt; gave them the idea in some <br/>\n&gt; carts-before-horses way that if they leave a mess<br/>\n&gt; for someone else to clean (even <br/>\n&gt; if it&#39;s a sudden discrete mess they individually and<br/>\n&gt; specifically made) you <br/>\n&gt; said something I would never have said.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if it was a speech, but it could have<br/>\nbeen.  I *do* have that tendency, to make<br/>\nproclamations and declarations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was way back in the summer, when we decided that<br/>\nfreedom was desireable.  We had a discussion about how<br/>\nit might look to not have assigned chores, and how if<br/>\neveryone just cleaned up after themselves and each<br/>\nother, we wouldn&#39;t have to have weekly or monthly<br/>\nchores.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it was just one discussion during the summer, and<br/>\nperhaps it needs to be revisited to see how well it is<br/>\ngoing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t like the term &quot;dechoring&quot; or &quot;choring&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; &quot;chore.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For lack of brain power this morning, that is all I<br/>\ncould come up with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are you living well together as a group?  Does it<br/>\n&gt; involve freedom and choices <br/>\n&gt; and helping and cooperation?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see progress in that direction, but so much further<br/>\nfrom my &quot;ideal&quot; in my head.  Maybe I am thinking we<br/>\nwill turn into &quot;Surviving the Applewhites&quot; or<br/>\nsomething.  I guess I need to get a real view of *our*<br/>\nhousehold and how it will look here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s not something you<br/>\n&gt; can do behind your <br/>\n&gt; husband&#39;s back.   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oooh.  I never thought of it as going behind his back,<br/>\nbut more of trying to keep his stress level down after<br/>\na long days&#39; work.  Perhaps you&#39;re right,<br/>\nthough...maybe I am being sneaky instead of helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And maybe it&#39;s not something you<br/>\n&gt; can do altogether all at once.  <br/>\n&gt; Maybe more discussions with the kids about what you<br/>\n&gt; would like to see happen <br/>\n&gt; would help.  You could say &quot;If it seems there are<br/>\n&gt; other ways to go about this, <br/>\n&gt; we can do other things, but because your dad doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; believe it can work, we <br/>\n&gt; need to figure out an intermediary phase (or<br/>\n&gt; something).&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When we&#39;ve had adult housemates, we&#39;ve asked them to<br/>\n&gt; do things.  &quot;Would you <br/>\n&gt; be willing to make breakfast Saturday when we have<br/>\n&gt; company?&quot; or &quot;Could you fix <br/>\n&gt; that light fixture when you get a chance?&quot; or &quot;Could<br/>\n&gt; you change the laundry <br/>\n&gt; when it&#39;s done?&quot;  But I wouldn&#39;t have &quot;given them<br/>\n&gt; chores&quot; and insisted they did <br/>\n&gt; it all the time.  And I wouldn&#39;t have said, &quot;You<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have to do ANYTHING <br/>\n&gt; around here.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think I expected them to be so happy about not<br/>\nhaving assigned chores that had to be done whether<br/>\nthey had a free moment or not that they would gladly<br/>\njust pitch in wherever help was needed, which i see<br/>\nnow is unrealistic.  They just don&#39;t &quot;see&quot; what needs<br/>\ndoing unless I point it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe it wasn&#39;t anything you said.  Maybe it&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt; their experimentation to <br/>\n&gt; see if you&#39;ve just gone crazy and will regain your<br/>\n&gt; sanity soon and it will all <br/>\n&gt; be over.  So maybe they have no faith that this will<br/>\n&gt; work either, and they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; enjoying what they think might just be a lull.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m really enjoying being the cool mom and the fun<br/>\nmom, and being free...really free...to let go of<br/>\nself-imposed rules and regulations.  The kids&#39; friends<br/>\nthink my kids have the perfect life, and can&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand why their own parents don&#39;t relax even a<br/>\nlittle bit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think my kids are a bit stunned too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone mentioned during the dishes discussion how she<br/>\ncollects beautiful plates, not necessarily matched<br/>\nsets.  I was the one stunned.  I couldn&#39;t believe I<br/>\nhad always thought dishes should match.  What FUN!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, that empowerment thing is snowballing, though,<br/>\nand rolling down the hill faster and faster, sucking<br/>\nup different areas of my life.

With the kitchen clean, I&#39;m shopping better - for <br/>\nfoods they want more. Cooking more, less fast food. With the dining <br/>\nroom/living room clean, there is room for them to drag out projects to <br/>\ndo, games to play, etc. Everybody is hanging out more together. I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen buying scented candles and burning them a lot - house smells nice. <br/>\nEverybody is happier. I&#39;m doing more housework, but not a LOT more.

It&#39;s one thing not to <br/>\nrequire public chores of people (cleaning up after others, doing their dad&#39;s <br/>\nlaundry for him) but quite a whole foreign different thing to give a child the <br/>\nimpression that she&#39;s not responsible for even her own messes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were one of mine I would say that only AFTER she had cleaned other <br/>\npeople&#39;s messes up sweetly and quietly for a long time do they start to clean up <br/>\nafter her.   (And I&#39;d say that to moms too.  Some moms have done little to no <br/>\nquiet and sweet cleaning.  They&#39;ve done a lot of grumbling and muttering <br/>\ncleaning and then they send their family the bill in one way or another.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Now, if asked, they will do things, begrudgingly,<br/>\nbecause it has always been expected.

Does it involve freedom and choices <br/>\nand helping and cooperation?  It&#39;s not something you can do behind your <br/>\nhusband&#39;s back.   And maybe it&#39;s not something you can do altogether all at once.  <br/>\nMaybe more discussions with the kids about what you would like to see happen <br/>\nwould help.  You could say &quot;If it seems there are other ways to go about this, <br/>\nwe can do other things, but because your dad doesn&#39;t believe it can work, we <br/>\nneed to figure out an intermediary phase (or something).&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we&#39;ve had adult housemates, we&#39;ve asked them to do things.  &quot;Would you <br/>\nbe willing to make breakfast Saturday when we have company?&quot; or &quot;Could you fix <br/>\nthat light fixture when you get a chance?&quot; or &quot;Could you change the laundry <br/>\nwhen it&#39;s done?&quot;  But I wouldn&#39;t have &quot;given them chores&quot; and insisted they did <br/>\nit all the time.  And I wouldn&#39;t have said, &quot;You don&#39;t have to do ANYTHING <br/>\naround here.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it wasn&#39;t anything you said.

We have a goal at our<br/>\nhouse that each of us lives in complete freedom as long as it doesn&#39;t cause<br/>\nharm.  Note this is a goal and we don&#39;t always reach it, but we do try.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when something comes up, like people not cleaning up after themselves, we<br/>\nsit down and talk about it.  Not in a &quot;You little snot, I can&#39;t believe you<br/>\nexpect me to clean up after you.&quot;  But in a gentle, loving &quot;this is how I<br/>\nfeel when I see messes left around&quot; kind of thing.  We talk about how our<br/>\nactions have consequences, not only for ourselves but for others and the<br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think gentle reminders are likely to simply be a part of mothering.  Let&#39;s<br/>\nface it.  The kids are simply not as invested in picking up as you are.<br/>\nThey have other things on their minds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also try to treat our home, as &quot;OUR home&quot;, not MY house.  If I were at my<br/>\nmom&#39;s and I saw a mess in the living room, I would pick it up just to help<br/>\nout my mom.  I try to do the same things for the kids.  I help them where I<br/>\ncan because I love them and it models helpful behavior to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that was absolutely NOT helpful for us during the transition was<br/>\nfor me to go into the living room where all the kids are doing something and<br/>\nsay &quot;Would you guys go clean your rooms up?  I can&#39;t even walk in there.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was helpful was to ask a child individually, when they were between<br/>\nactivities (you know, that pass through the kitchen to see what everybody is<br/>\ndoing thing that kids do) if that individual child would help me do<br/>\nsomething, asked in a kind, fun, gentle way.  Like &quot;Hey Zach, I was having<br/>\ntrouble finding a book to read to Danny in y&#39;all&#39;s room last night.  I was<br/>\ngonna organize things in there so you can find them easier.  Would you like<br/>\nto help me?&quot;  I get the occassional &quot;no&quot; but most of the kids enjoy alone<br/>\ntime with mom and they know straightening up won&#39;t take but a minute.<br/>\n<br/>\n An important note on this I think, is then to take what they want to do<br/>\nabout helping very serious.  Example:  If Zach wants to put his underwear on<br/>\nthe bookshelves rather than in a drawer, I respect that and help him do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.---who in real life would be thrilled if Zach showed any interest in<br/>\nhis underwear at all<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Wife2Vegman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wifetovegman2002@...\">wifetovegman2002@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, December 27, 2003 11:28 AM<br/>\nSubject: Cleaning (was Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Radical v regular)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, I typed this all up, tried to send and the<br/>\n&gt; computer froze up...I don&#39;t know if it ever was sent,<br/>\n&gt; so I will try again...with a shortened version of what<br/>\n&gt; I originally typed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I dropped assigned chores about three months ago, but<br/>\n&gt; no one seems to be pitching in to help around here,<br/>\n&gt; and will even just leave messes for others to clean.<br/>\n&gt; I am ending up doing all of the cleaning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One child was overheard by another mom on the phone to<br/>\n&gt; say to a friend, &quot;oops, I spilled my smoothie all over<br/>\n&gt; the counter.

Just<br/>\nthought I had a thing for housework. I really enjoy keeping a neat clean<br/>\nhouse and aside from changing sheets, never grumble about any of it. So I<br/>\nthought the dish thing was the same. I never had a dish washer in my life up<br/>\nuntil 3 years ago. If I use it 6 times in a year, that&#39;s a lot. But with<br/>\nreading your post, I realized what keeps me joyful doing the dishes and when<br/>\nit does start to get to me a bit. I find late night washing irritates me<br/>\nwhen something dirty is still in the sink. It&#39;s because the kids aren&#39;t up<br/>\nor out and about. When I&#39;m standing at my sink, I have a large open window<br/>\ninto the playroom. That&#39;s where all the games and most of the toys are as<br/>\nwell as the tv and playstation. During the day, at least one body is usually<br/>\nin there. What better way for me to enjoy dishwashing then to see my<br/>\nbeautiful offspring enjoying life. Or to see my husband taking out his<br/>\nfrustrations on playstation. And in the daylight, I open the blinds and have<br/>\na wonderful view of the pool. Cats sitting on the ledge watching lizards and<br/>\nbirds fly about. Sometimes sitting on the counter watching me and the water<br/>\nand sponge move all about. So it&#39;s only late at night, when kids are<br/>\nsleeping or playing in their rooms and cats have no lizards to watch and the<br/>\npool is too dark to see that I think crap!!!! dishes again?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.

I have a bird feeder on the<br/>\n&gt; garden fence post I can see when I&#39;m standing at the sink and in the<br/>\n&gt; summer, my little herb garden grows and blooms there.  I have a tall and<br/>\n&gt; twirly copper sprinkler there looks like a cat jumping for a bird.  I<br/>\n&gt; have plants in my windowsill.  Some of Dylan&#39;s rocks are there, shiny<br/>\n&gt; obsidian and smoky quartz.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I turn on Asian Groove or Keb Mo&#39; or someone and pour myself a little<br/>\n&gt; wine.  I light a candle.  I like the way the hot water feels and I like<br/>\n&gt; the way the dish soap smells.  I like all the colors in the bubbles.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My dad gave me my dishes, Franciscan Ware, and I still think they&#39;re so<br/>\n&gt; pretty - especially the cups and saucers.  When I wash them I think about<br/>\n&gt; the day my dad and I saw them at the store and how he surprised me with<br/>\n&gt; them later for my birthday.   Before I had those I collected mismatched<br/>\n&gt; stoneware and have all kinds of assorted bowls and plates and mugs and<br/>\n&gt; whatnots.  When I wash my pitcher I think about when I found it at the<br/>\n&gt; Renaissance fair in Anchorage twenty years ago and who I was with and<br/>\n&gt; what they might be doing now.  I have a few pieces of Polish pottery that<br/>\n&gt; are so beautiful I don&#39;t know how I lived before I had them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I love the way glass and ceramic dries almost instantly if you&#39;ve rinsed<br/>\n&gt; it in really hot water.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I get all that, plus I get to do something nice and useful for my<br/>\n&gt; family.&lt;g&gt;  I put the herb garden just there on purpose, and the bird<br/>\n&gt; feeder, the pretty sprinkler, the wind chimes, the kitchen plants.

No, <br/>\nreally, if you saw how small my kitchen is, you&#39;d probably die of a <br/>\nheart attack. I wash while I&#39;m cooking away because I have very limited <br/>\ncounter & sink space. I do not enjoy in a whistly way like Mark. He <br/>\nloves doing dishes in the morning. It&#39;s his way of waking up. It&#39;s like <br/>\na working meditation for him (I sometimes feel he should have been a <br/>\nZen Buddist monk). Am I going to bitch to him about the dishes while <br/>\nI&#39;m cooking because someone else has to clean? No. It&#39;s just not <br/>\npractical. There is little space for 2 in the kitchen. I&#39;d rather do it <br/>\nwhile cooking. So practicality wins over whining.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome time ago I was doing the dishes after dinner, a rarity. Mark was <br/>\nnot around for some reason. The pile was high, he was coming home late, <br/>\nso I just dragged my feet to the sink. Then a thought crept in my mind. <br/>\nHow lucky I am that I have a husband and partner. That we complement <br/>\neach other on our neurosae. That we have someone to rely upon. I have <br/>\nso many single-mother neighbors here, with 1-2-4 kids to take care of <br/>\nand full-time jobs. When we all see each other at the playground, we <br/>\nall bitch about the same stuff: schedules, housework, chores. Then <br/>\nreality strikes. Not doing the dishes while Mark was not around seems <br/>\njust inconsequential. These women have lives much harder and <br/>\ncomplicated than I. What they have to go through actually makes my <br/>\n&#39;choice&#39; a privilege.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, I am grateful to my single-mom neighbors.

Some of Dylan&#39;s rocks are there, shiny<br/>\nobsidian and smoky quartz.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI turn on Asian Groove or Keb Mo&#39; or someone and pour myself a little<br/>\nwine.  I light a candle.  I like the way the hot water feels and I like<br/>\nthe way the dish soap smells.  I like all the colors in the bubbles.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad gave me my dishes, Franciscan Ware, and I still think they&#39;re so<br/>\npretty - especially the cups and saucers.  When I wash them I think about<br/>\nthe day my dad and I saw them at the store and how he surprised me with<br/>\nthem later for my birthday.   Before I had those I collected mismatched<br/>\nstoneware and have all kinds of assorted bowls and plates and mugs and<br/>\nwhatnots.  When I wash my pitcher I think about when I found it at the<br/>\nRenaissance fair in Anchorage twenty years ago and who I was with and<br/>\nwhat they might be doing now.  I have a few pieces of Polish pottery that<br/>\nare so beautiful I don&#39;t know how I lived before I had them. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love the way glass and ceramic dries almost instantly if you&#39;ve rinsed<br/>\nit in really hot water.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI get all that, plus I get to do something nice and useful for my<br/>\nfamily.&lt;g&gt;  I put the herb garden just there on purpose, and the bird<br/>\nfeeder, the pretty sprinkler, the wind chimes, the kitchen plants.  I buy<br/>\nlittle candles on sale when I find the kind I like.  I planned and saved<br/>\nfor a cd player for my kitchen .  I&#39;m not just doing dishes I&#39;m<br/>\nreflecting on the good things in my life.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Dylan was little if he was cranky and nothing seemed to help I would<br/>\nmake a bath for him and he&#39;d come out after awhile feeling happy and<br/>\nwarm.   Dish doing is my attitude adjustment.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Radical v regular","postDate":"1072461445","msgId":86853,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY2NzlCRDIzLTM3Q0MtMTFEOC05RDdGLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDdjLjQwN2EzOTVlLjJkMWRiYjM3QGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDdjLjQwN2EzOTVlLjJkMWRiYjM3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":86851,"nextInTopic":86854,"prevInTime":86852,"nextInTime":86854,"topicId":86848,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We&#39;re not there to see you or to hear you grumbling <br/>\ninstead of washing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned all this chore-choice thing from people at www.unschooling.com and <br/>\nsome of them explained it better.   But knowing you could choose not to do <br/>\ndishes does make it a choice.  You could use paper plates.  You could try to make <br/>\none of the kids do it (and that will involve negative side issues you might <br/>\nwant to choose to avoid).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could buy new dishes at a garage sale and throw your old ones away if <br/>\nyou&#39;re just tired of looking at them.  That might make doing dishes more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never had a dishwasher in my whole life until I was pregnant with Marty.  <br/>\nFor my birthday I got a birthday card from my husband that said I could have <br/>\nthe major appliance of my choice.  I didn&#39;t have a microwave either.  I chose a <br/>\ndishwasher.  Knowing I had considered a microwave, Keith&#39;s parents gave us one <br/>\nfor Christmas, and then Marty was born January 14.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo until 15 years ago,  I had washed dishes by hand my whole life. <br/>\n<br/>\nI made games with them, and patterns, and used the time to think or to sing <br/>\nsongs I was trying to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live where dishes are best left to dry themselves, so I rarely dried and <br/>\nput them away.  Putting them away when they were dry was another set of games <br/>\nand contests with myself.  Sorting silverware in my hand, twirling them into <br/>\nthe right order without putting them down or changing hands.  Stuff like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I got new &quot;silverware&quot; (stainless), service for 12.  VERY very <br/>\ncool, and that&#39;s making doing dishes fun again.  I washed them all by hand and <br/>\nadmired them all.  I totally rearranged the drawer and sorted what to give away <br/>\nand what to keep.  It was FUN.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Or <br/>\ncan&#39;t it be OK for me to be less-than-joyful about some things with the full <br/>\nknowledge that I chose to, for instance, eat, and will probably be a little <br/>\nhappier with a cleaner sink? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re all choices whether you&#39;re joyful about them or not.  They&#39;re not <br/>\nhave-tos.  You know where the door is.  You could throw the dishes out the window <br/>\nand walk out the door, but you have chosen to hang out and re-use those <br/>\ndishes.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;But it&#39;s not <br/>\ngoing to make me joyful in the short-term while I&#39;m doing the darn things. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat could make you more joyful?  Are they &quot;the darn things&quot;?  Why?<br/>\nI like my dishes.  Even the Rubbermaid plastic plates I collect from <br/>\nthriftstores because they stack so nicely and they&#39;re easy to use and wash.  Sometimes <br/>\nwe use &quot;the real plates,&quot; but they&#39;re heavy and dangerous.  I was in an <br/>\nemergency room with a friend who had been mugged once.  A woman was in next to us <br/>\nwho dropped a dinner plate on her foot and it had broken and cut her badly.  So <br/>\n95 cent used plastic it is.  A choice based on factors and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Maybe dishes make other people joyful. Maybe that&#39;s why they think I shou<br/>\nld <br/>\nbe joyful while doing dishes. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other way around.
