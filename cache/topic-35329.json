As far as I can tell, it seems rough to make a go of it year <br/>\nround in the northwoods.   There just aren&#39;t that many jobs available.  Of <br/>\ncourse, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re thinking of as far as jobs, but there aren&#39;t <br/>\na lot of either blue or white collar opportunties in many of those northern <br/>\ncounties.  A lot of service work-tourist related.  But hey, if it&#39;s your <br/>\ndream, and you can make it work...more power to you.  I personally think the <br/>\nwinters would be o.k. because it&#39;s just so darn beautiful and cozy and quiet. <br/>\n Good luck to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1278341,"authorName":"Ann Yates","from":"&quot;Ann Yates&quot; &lt;hooperck@...&gt;","profile":"mumsienc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Anyone in Northern WI","postDate":"1019277050","msgId":35329,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTMwMWMxZTgyNCQyNzk0OTQ4MCRmMTg1ZmVhOUBtb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":35687,"prevInTime":35328,"nextInTime":35330,"topicId":35329,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m wondering if there is anyone here from Northern Wisconsin.
