Once the design is taken care of, all you have to do is type in the <br/>\ncontent on the post forms (which are the same as webmail @ Yahoo or <br/>\nHotmail).<br/>\n<br/>\n3. The systems create standards complaint pages, meaning, it will make <br/>\nsure it is readable in as many web browsers are possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. They create RSS files that make it easier for news readers to pick <br/>\nup your articles. RSS is short for Real Simple Syndication. No <br/>\nself-respecting content-developer (aka writer) would publish on the web <br/>\nw/o making it easy to broadcast around the web. You&#39;ve been around long <br/>\nenough and have quite a niche that you do not have to worry. BUT if you <br/>\nwanted to make it easier for people outside the unschooling niche to <br/>\nreach you through Google searches. Imagine if someone googling <br/>\n&quot;unschooling + spanking&quot; found you on the first page if not the top of <br/>\nthe list. Could scare those advocates away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many ways to manipulate what happens with spiders on the <br/>\nWWWeb. Spiders go out searching for a sites keywords and its referring <br/>\nlinks. That&#39;s how the search engines rate sites. The way to make this <br/>\nwork more to your advantage is with web pages that are easy for the <br/>\nbots to read (hence the W3 standards issue) and for people to link to <br/>\nyour pages (hence the advantage of templates in blogss because they <br/>\ngenerate all the internal architecture of a site automatically.
