What I object to is what<br/>\nthey are doing *while* they are hanging out.<br/>\n I absolutely agree that kids go through a period of &quot;idle time&quot; and I would<br/>\nnever insist on interrupting that to do &quot;constructive&quot; things.<br/>\n However, &quot;idle time&quot; is not what is happening here.  They aren&#39;t idly<br/>\nhanging out.  They are actively being destructive in a way that hurts<br/>\nthemselves and others.  My daughter feels the need to be &quot;busy&quot; with things,<br/>\nso I will help her stay busy by &quot;strewing new things in her path&quot;, but the<br/>\ngoal isn&#39;t so much to &quot;do constructive things&quot;.  The goal is just to help<br/>\nher find herself.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would imagine that everyone&#39;s circumstances concerning teenagers who seem<br/>\nto rebel are different. No two families are alike, and that makes advice<br/>\nhard to work into personal situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a lot of problems with my daughter when she was younger. Mine with her<br/>\nwere due to depression, divorce and school situations, not to mention family<br/>\nthat did everything wrong when it came to loving her. Myself included.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, we did find our way and now she&#39;s 18, and for quite awhile, we have had<br/>\na wonderful relationship. I still have people marvel at how she is with me.<br/>\nIn fact, she&#39;s coming along on our next big homeschool picnic just to hang<br/>\nout with me and the other kids. But it wasn&#39;t easy getting here. Just know<br/>\nit is possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the problems came at 12 and 13 with her, I was into taking away<br/>\npriveleges. Didn&#39;t phase her in the least. Just made her more angry. She was<br/>\nnever grounded for long but had at one time, everything taken away from her.<br/>\nThat made her good around the house, just hell on wheels when she was away<br/>\nfrom us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went through her sneaking out. (not at our house, at her cousins) She<br/>\nhung out with all the wrong kids. We&#39;ve been called by the police to come<br/>\nand get her. She&#39;s lied about where she was, who she was with and what she<br/>\nwas doing. She&#39;s had physical problems of her own because of her actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing we were actually &quot;doing&quot; was working at all. So we stopped doing<br/>\nanything. She came and went as she pleased while we all calmed down. Then we<br/>\ntalked. A lot! About how we felt, what we were scared of and what could<br/>\npossibly happen. We made a game plan, all 3 of us, as to alternatives in her<br/>\nlife. Different paths she could take. She was free to chose any one she<br/>\nwanted. We made it clear that what we would not allow was for her behavior<br/>\nto interfere with the safety of the other people in this house. That we<br/>\nstill did have a legal responsibility for her because of her age. That there<br/>\nwere things she did that would cost us our comfort here at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on what was going on at the time, we let her know exactly what we<br/>\nwould do to help and what we wouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t do. Then we left it all up<br/>\nto her. That was the defining point in her life and our relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also had told us that as much as she listened to what we had to say, and<br/>\nas much as she valued our opionions, she had the need to find out for<br/>\nherself. That was her way of learning and finding herself. She learns by<br/>\ndoing and a lot of the times, it&#39;s the hard way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as much as I wished she would have waited to do all sorts of things,<br/>\nshe&#39;s so much more grounded now than kids her age. I also have to say we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t freak out over what a lot of kids do. (for this example I&#39;m talking<br/>\nschool kids) The sex, drugs, drinking and smoking had to not be a major big<br/>\ndeal in order to be able to talk to her about these things. If I freaked at<br/>\nthe mention of sex or smoking, then talking about it would be out of the<br/>\nquestion.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe still makes choices that I would prefer were different. But it&#39;s not my<br/>\nlife, it&#39;s hers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will also say too that when it came to a matter of safety, we did what we<br/>\ncould. But even at that, we talked about the choices, what our fears were,<br/>\nwhat could happen to her, and when we would step in and make a decision. We<br/>\ndid have 3 smaller kids to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe would do things so differently if we had it all over again. But we did<br/>\nwhat we knew at the time. For us it worked out well. We&#39;re not only very<br/>\nproud of how far she&#39;s come, and love her dearly, but we also really like<br/>\nher a lot!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to talk further about anything, feel free to email me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Ok, real problem here","postDate":"1084042510","msgId":93686,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNCNDJENDZDLUExMjEtMTFEOC1BQzNGLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMmEwMWM0MzUxYSRiMjI2YjcwMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBrdXNoNjkwMD4=","referencesHeader":"PEJDQzIyRUMxLjI2QTNDJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8MDAxMjAxYzQzNTA5JGM5YzgxZjkwJDAyMDFhOGMwQGFvLmxvcC5jb20+IDwwMDJhMDFjNDM1MWEkYjIyNmI3MDAkNjQwMWE4YzBAa3VzaDY5MDA+"},"prevInTopic":93685,"nextInTopic":93689,"prevInTime":93685,"nextInTime":93687,"topicId":93659,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You guys always say you want to discuss &quot;real&quot; situations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, here is a real situation for you that involves a real unschooler who<br/>\npractices real unschooling and mindful parenting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My 12 year old daughter (remember her, the one with the friend issues and<br/>\nthe one who has started smoking?) has gotten into some BIG trouble this<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I won&#39;t go into the details but its big enough to be taken out of my hands<br/>\nif the offended party chooses to go that route.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At this point I feel she is forcing me to restrict her freedom.  Honestly,<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what else to do.  She is deliberately doing things that she<br/>\n*knows* are wrong.  Its not a matter of not knowing or being confused.  She<br/>\n*does* know.  There is no question about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why she is doing this I cannot guess, other than she wants to it in with<br/>\nthe people she is hanging out with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the other hand, it doesn&#39;t make much difference who she is hanging out<br/>\nwith.  SHE has to be able to draw the line when she knows something is<br/>\nwrong.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The problem is she doesn&#39;t *want* to say &quot;no&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She has freedom, unconditional love, and parents who are involved in her<br/>\nlife.  She has been encouraged and supported in every single one of her<br/>\ninterests.  Why does she need to &quot;fit in&quot; with this kind of crowd? And in<br/>\nfact, I think she wants to be the ringleader.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can anyone really tell me that they would not step in and set limits on<br/>\nfreedom in this situation for their child&#39;s own protection and long term<br/>\nwell being?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kristen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

You guys always say you want to discuss &quot;real&quot; situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, here is a real situation for you that involves a real unschooler who practices real unschooling and mindful parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 year old daughter (remember her, the one with the friend issues and the one who has started smoking?) has gotten into some BIG trouble this time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t go into the details but its big enough to be taken out of my hands if the offended party chooses to go that route.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point I feel she is forcing me to restrict her freedom.  Honestly, I don&#39;t know what else to do.  She is deliberately doing things that she *knows* are wrong.  Its not a matter of not knowing or being confused.  She *does* know.  There is no question about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy she is doing this I cannot guess, other than she wants to it in with the people she is hanging out with.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, it doesn&#39;t make much difference who she is hanging out with.  SHE has to be able to draw the line when she knows something is wrong.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is she doesn&#39;t *want* to say &quot;no&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has freedom, unconditional love, and parents who are involved in her life.  She has been encouraged and supported in every single one of her interests.  Why does she need to &quot;fit in&quot; with this kind of crowd? And in fact, I think she wants to be the ringleader.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone really tell me that they would not step in and set limits on freedom in this situation for their child&#39;s own protection and long term well being?<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28916,"nextTopicId":93726}}
