The women are sitting<br/>\non a bench watching.   Eventually, they begin to talk.<br/>\nW1: Hi. My name is Maggie. My kids are the three<br/>\nin red shirts --helps me keep track of them.<br/>\nW2: (Smiles) I&#39;m Terri. Mine are in the pink and<br/>\nyellow shirts. Do you come here a lot?<br/>\nW1: Usually two or three times a week, after we go to<br/>\nthe library.<br/>\nW2: Wow. Where do you find the time?<br/>\nW1: We home school, so we do it during the day most of<br/>\nthe time.<br/>\nW2: Some of my neighbors home school, but I send my<br/>\nkids to public school.<br/>\nW1: How do you do it?<br/>\nW2: It&#39;s not easy. I go to all the PTO meetings and<br/>\nwork with the kids every day after school and stay<br/>\nreal involved.<br/>\nW1: But what about socialization? Aren&#39;t you worried<br/>\nabout them being cooped up all day with kids their own<br/>\nages, never getting the opportunity for natural<br/>\nrelationships?<br/>\nW2: Well, yes. But I work hard to balance that. They<br/>\nhave some friends who&#39;re home schooled, and we visit<br/>\ntheir grandparents almost every month.<br/>\nW1: Sounds like you&#39;re a very dedicated mom. But don&#39;t<br/>\nyou worry about all the opportunities they&#39;re missing<br/>\nout on? I mean they&#39;re so isolated from real life --<br/>\nhow will they know what the world is like -- what<br/>\npeople do to make a living -- how to get along with<br/>\nall different kinds of people?<br/>\nW2: Oh, we discussed that at PTO, and we started a<br/>\nfund to bring real people into the classrooms. Last<br/>\nmonth, we had a policeman and a doctor come in to talk<br/>\nto every class. And next month, we&#39;re having a woman<br/>\nfrom Japan and a man from Kenya come to speak.<br/>\nW1: Oh, we met a man from Japan in the grocery store<br/>\nthe other week, and he got to talking about his<br/>\nchildhood in Tokyo. My kids were absolutely<br/>\nfascinated. We invited him to dinner and got to meet<br/>\nhis wife and their three children.<br/>\nW2: That&#39;s nice. Hmm. Maybe we should plan some<br/>\nJapanese food for the lunchroom on Multicultural Day.<br/>\nW1: Maybe your Japanese guest could eat with the<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\nW2: Oh, no. She&#39;s on a very tight schedule. She has<br/>\ntwo other schools to visit that day. It&#39;s a<br/>\nsystem-wide thing we&#39;re doing.<br/>\nW1: Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Well, maybe you&#39;ll meet someone<br/>\ninteresting in the grocery store sometime and you&#39;ll<br/>\nend up having them over for dinner.<br/>\nW2: I don&#39;t think so. I never talk to people in the<br/>\nstore --certainly not people who might not even speak<br/>\nmy language. What if that Japanese man hadn&#39;t spoken<br/>\nEnglish?<br/>\nW1: To tell you the truth, I never had time to think<br/>\nabout it. Before I even saw him, my six-year-old had<br/>\nasked him what he was going to do with all the oranges<br/>\nhe was buying.<br/>\nW2: Your child talks to strangers?<br/>\nW1: I was right there with him. He knows that as long<br/>\nas he&#39;s with me, he can talk to anyone he wishes.<br/>\nW2: But you&#39;re developing dangerous habits in him. My<br/>\nchildren never talk to strangers.<br/>\nW1: Not even when they&#39;re with you?<br/>\nW2: They&#39;re never with me, except at home after<br/>\nschool. So you see why it&#39;s so important for them to<br/>\nunderstand<br/>\nthat talking to strangers is a big no-no.<br/>\nW1: Yes, I do. But if they were with you, they could<br/>\nget to meet interesting people and still be safe.<br/>\nThey&#39;d get a taste of the real world, in real<br/>\nsettings. They&#39;d also get a real feel for how to tell<br/>\nwhen a situation is dangerous or suspicious.<br/>\nW2: They&#39;ll get that in the third and fifth grades in<br/>\ntheir health courses.<br/>\nW1: Well, I can tell you&#39;re a very caring mom. Let me<br/>\ngive you my number--if you ever want to talk, give me<br/>\ncall. It was good to meet you.<br/>\n--Author unknown<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nJoin a new list today!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
