We finally started buying the <br/>\nHarry Potter legos and he LOVES them.  He helps his dad build some, <br/>\nbuilt one of the smaller sets himself with a little assistance.

We kept <br/>\nputting them away, but once he got a chance he was as gentle as can <br/>\nbe!!  So the experts tell you &quot;this&quot; age and up, and it is better to <br/>\nlisten to your children (as long as they don&#39;t eat them &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we were so excited.
