The university here does<br/>\nsummer programs, taking kids out to look for rocks and crystals.   That&#39;s<br/>\nfun because you learn some good places to hunt for rocks and there are<br/>\nusually some  stray geologists along for the ride.   The programs here<br/>\nare not structured at all.   You show up at the university, pay five<br/>\nbucks, jump in their van and go look for rocks.   Pack a lunch, wander<br/>\naround, have fun.  LOTS of folks on those types of excursions are<br/>\nhomeschoolers.  <br/>\nDylan keeps his little rocks in egg cartons and his big rocks everywhere<br/>\nelse.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a pretty book called Pebble Mosaics by Deborah Schneebeli-Morrell<br/>\nand Gloria Nicol <br/>\nISBN# 1-55297-573-8 published by Firefly books and it shows you how to<br/>\nmake baskets and fountains and walkways and such out of pebbles.  We made<br/>\nsome stepping stones after looking at that book and they&#39;re really<br/>\nbeautiful. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t found the various rock field guides to be especially useful. <br/>\nThe rocks in those books are museum quality specimens and almost never<br/>\nlook like the chunk of geology you&#39;re holding in your hand.   They have<br/>\nother good information in them but I think you need to be an expert to<br/>\naccurately identify rocks by a field guide and then of course, you<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t need the field guide.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s wonderfully fun to look at rocks under a microscope.   We look at<br/>\nrocks first just like we found them, with dirt and junk still on them.  <br/>\nSometimes you can find other cool stuff this way.   Once we found an<br/>\nant&#39;s head in a crevasse of a rock and were able to gently lift it out<br/>\nwith a needle.   Under the microscope it looked just like those pictures<br/>\nof little gray aliens that are always being seen in the Ozarks by guys<br/>\nnamed Joe Bob.   <br/>\nAfter you look at them dirty you can scrub them up and see what was under<br/>\nall that dirt.  <br/>\nIf you already have some river rocks piling up you can put them in your<br/>\nplants (I first typed &quot;pants&quot; there, I must still be thinking of<br/>\nCadburrys)  or cleaned up really well into a fish tank or frog or turtle<br/>\ntank.    That&#39;s a great excuse to get some frogs, if you needed one.&lt;g&gt; <br/>\nWhich reminds me of pants again as African dwarf swimming frogs are<br/>\nextraordinarily lusty.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLook for interesting rocks around gopher holes.  Apparently gophers don&#39;t<br/>\ncare much about keeping cool rocks and they just leave them where anyone<br/>\ncan pick them up.   Also, if the gopher is gone, look for spiders webs<br/>\nand their occupants in the opening.   We have seen some great spiders<br/>\nthis way.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what that has to do with rocks, but I&#39;m now wondering if it<br/>\nhas anything to do with the vanished gopher...<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: rocks","postDate":"1044931297","msgId":58456,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNTEwMWMyZDE3OCQxOTFlNmJlMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGIyN2ZocitqMnFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58455,"nextInTopic":58466,"prevInTime":58455,"nextInTime":58457,"topicId":58356,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Our sugar crystals haven t worked either.

He likes<br/>\n&gt; rocks. He has collected them since he was little. Since this is something he<br/>\n&gt; is interested in, what exactly do I do now? I am waiting for our library to<br/>\n&gt; get a book about experiments with rocks (it is checked out at the time). He<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem interested in reading books about rocks really because most of<br/>\n&gt; these are too encyclopedia-like to catch his interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why don&#39;t *you* read the books yourself?  Not to him, but to yourself.  You<br/>\nmight get some ideas.  You might learn something cool that you could share<br/>\nwith him.  You might even see why he&#39;s not particularly interested in these<br/>\nbooks. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou could use some of his larger rocks in art projects.  We&#39;ve made some<br/>\ncool painted rocks compliments of a klutz press kit that Tim got as a<br/>\npresent from his grandparents.  But the kit only has ideas.  All you need is<br/>\npaint, it&#39;s nothing fancy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about repeating Gallileo&#39;s experiment on larger/smaller: which falls<br/>\nfaster.  Can&#39;t be very hard to get any kid interested in dropping rocks out<br/>\nof a second floor window!  (Look out, below!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you broken any of them open?<br/>\nExplored crystals?  Crystals are cool because you can make your own with<br/>\nsugar and water and food coloring.<br/>\nWould he be interested in how some native peoples made arrowheads out of<br/>\nflint?  (flintknapping, it&#39;s called, if you&#39;re googling it)<br/>\nAny lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, or oceans nearby that you could go dig a<br/>\nhandful of rocks out of the bottom?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cool part of any one interest to me is not how long we can prolong that<br/>\ninterest, it&#39;s all the totally different places any one interest can take<br/>\nus.  And how one thing can take us somewhere totally different.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is a fanatic coin collector.  His allowance goes almost entirely<br/>\ntowards coin purchases.  It started because we went to a church conference<br/>\nin Rome.  I was there to represent my church, and had hoped that Rome would<br/>\nget him interested in history.  You know, Roman history.  (He was 5.  Duh,<br/>\nMom.)  But Tim seemed interested before we left, and was impressed by the<br/>\ncollesium and Roman ruins.  For about 10 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the people at my conference came from all over Europe, and the Bishop<br/>\nfrom Portugal (wearing a really cool purple shirt) gave him a portugese coin<br/>\nand mentioned that there were people here from Switzerland and Belgium and<br/>\nother places.  Everybody there met my &quot;shy&quot; son.  He asked every single<br/>\nperson for money from their country.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;ll still ask people for money from their country.  His goal is a coin<br/>\nfrom every country in the world.  From a trip to Rome, he learned about<br/>\nmoney and talking to people.  Kids are amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWonder where rocks will take your son.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] rocks","postDate":"1044834855","msgId":58356,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNkNBMkE0LjFFMDIlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDQ4MjkxODAuNTU4OC4xNTg4OS5tM0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":58357,"prevInTime":58355,"nextInTime":58357,"topicId":58356,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
