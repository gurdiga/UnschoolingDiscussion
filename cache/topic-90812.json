Since<br/>\nthis is her goal, I just do what we&#39;ve always done - find out what&#39;s needed,<br/>\nexamine various resources, etc. It&#39;s still all up to her. For instance,<br/>\nabout a year ago, I began a discussion with her about studying a language.<br/>\nWhat I said was: here&#39;s some options: you can do the required 2-4 yrs of<br/>\nlanguage in some way or you can forget about it and find colleges that don&#39;t<br/>\ncare. Zoe: I want to learn a language. Me: OK, any that strike you as<br/>\ninteresting? Spanish is practical. Zoe: Not Spanish, that&#39;s so ordinary<br/>\n(History repeats itself: that&#39;s how I ended up studying Russian in HS &lt;gg&gt;).<br/>\nMe: It seems to me that the best way to really be able to learn to speak a<br/>\nnew language is to be around someone who really speaks it. Zoe: my good<br/>\nfriend Hannah and her whole family speak German. It would be fun to learn<br/>\nwith them. Me: Cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was a year ago. Since then, she bought herself a dictionary and a<br/>\nworkbook. She did some work in the workbook right away and then none at all.<br/>\nHannah&#39;s family brought her some German kid&#39;s books. She hears them speak<br/>\nGerman a lot. She&#39;s learned some vocabulary. That&#39;s it. Maybe she&#39;ll do more<br/>\nas time passes. Maybe she&#39;ll bag it and find colleges that don&#39;t care. Maybe<br/>\nshe&#39;ll bag the idea of college and it will be moot. All reasonable choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember, not everyone goes to college at 18. And not everyone goes into<br/>\na regular 4 yr program. There&#39;s options galore!<br/>\n<br/>\nPaula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90726,"nextTopicId":90814}}
