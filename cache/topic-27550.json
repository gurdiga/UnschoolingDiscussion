When they were little, I pretty <br/>\nmuch was.  But people grow and change.  If I want to get their attention I <br/>\nneed to actually be saying something important or attractive.

Maybe because I didn&#39;t pre-judge the things <br/>\nto be bad, and pre-conceive what &quot;balance&quot; would be it&#39;s working out well <br/>\nhere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do have the advantage of having started early with kids who hadn&#39;t gone to <br/>\nschool.  And there are people here reading who are in that same situation.  I <br/>\nthink some of the limiting parents do is like school and because of <br/>\nschool--at least the school models in the parents&#39; heads.  They think school <br/>\nlearning has to look like and be like school, and they value school-learning <br/>\n(subject areas) over what they see as playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people don&#39;t honestly believe that learning can come from play.<br/>\nThat  makes it really hard to unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even new age health folk have &quot;sins&quot; to consider.  It seems this <br/>\nbeta-wave state is a state of sin to some here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs sleeping sin?  Do you limit your children&#39;s sleep to 8 hours a day?  Even <br/>\nbabies and toddlers?  Even teenaged boys?  How&#39;s the brain wave while <br/>\nsleeping?  (I already know; was hoping others would consider it, though, and <br/>\nremember what temporary insanities can be induced by lack of sleep.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder what brain wave state dancers and jocks are in?
