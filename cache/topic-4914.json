I do not home school my children because of<br/>\n&quot;racism, paranoia, religious intolerance or combinations thereof&quot;. <br/>\nRather it is for the benefits of a 1:2 teacher to student ratio, the<br/>\nprivilege of spending large amounts of time with my children, whose<br/>\ncompany I enjoy, and the ability to focus on basic education and<br/>\nextracurricular activities, just to name a few.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve it or not, my children do play with children who attend school<br/>\nand watch TV.  They even watch TV in our home (Gasp!).  They associate<br/>\nwith Catholics, Mormons, Christians, and Agnostics.  They play with<br/>\ncousins whose skin is a different color than their own.  When they are a<br/>\nbit older, I will probably read and discuss 1984 with them.  How many<br/>\nparents of schooled children do you know who read and discuss a variety<br/>\nof literature with their children?  Be honest!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said &quot;Lord knows those kids don&#39;t present a threat to my kids getting<br/>\na scholarship.&quot;  Are you aware that homeschooled &quot;kids&quot; are receiving<br/>\nscholarships at places like Harvard, not to mention numerous state<br/>\ncolleges?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou seem to be concerned about homeschooled children having an unfair<br/>\nadvantage in athletic competitions.  If you did even a little research,<br/>\nyou would find that there are requirements for homeschooling families. <br/>\nWe do not &quot;get up around 10 A.M., go to the gym for a couple hours, hang<br/>\nout for lunch&quot; and then lie about what we do.  I have done and continue<br/>\nto do research on education and home schooling.  Before you continue to<br/>\nslander a group of people whom you obviously know nothing about, please<br/>\ndo some research of your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nMary Ellen Gates<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>\nTry Juno Web: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4903,"nextTopicId":4892}}
