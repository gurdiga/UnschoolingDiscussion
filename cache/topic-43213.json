I only gave one driving <br/>\nlesson in my life and it was to a twenty-something woman from a small <br/>\ntown in Africa where women just didn&#39;t drive.  Her boyfriend asked me <br/>\nto take her out and teach her.  I told her nothing--assuming she knew <br/>\nthe basics.  We went out to a long straight country road and as we <br/>\nwere driving she was crossing the line into the other lane.  Let me <br/>\ntell, I was nervous.  But not nearly as nervous as when she asked me <br/>\nafter a few minutes how to stop the car!!
