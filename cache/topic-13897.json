The sun is shining here for a change and <br/>\nso we are thrilled. <br/>\n<br/>\nI told myself I was not going to join in on this discussion as everyone <br/>\nalways gets upset and angry when religion is the subject. Changed my mind :)<br/>\n    I enjoyed reading Sandra&#39;s remarks about Satanism because the kids and I <br/>\nhave been reading up on Halloween after an adult friend of my daughters told <br/>\nher Halloween was Satan&#39;s holiday. It got us curious as to how this theory <br/>\ncame about. Of course when we researched it we found nothing about Satanism <br/>\nbut instead read all about Paganism. Very interesting. Learned a lot of <br/>\nhistory. I wonder how all these Satan ideas got started.<br/>\nI also thought Sandra&#39;s remarks about Christianity being based on human <br/>\nsacrifice and cannibalism was interesting. We just saw a show on the Travel <br/>\nChannel about how horridly cruel people were to each other. And yes they were <br/>\nCatholic (as that was the only Christians at that time ). An example would be <br/>\nwitch burning, caused by the fear of Christians of witchcraft (and also just <br/>\na good way to get rid of someone you did not like). Lets face it, humans have <br/>\na bloody horrid history. <br/>\n<br/>\nReligion. It certainly seems to bring out both the worst and the best in <br/>\npeople. I am not talking about anyone on this list. I am thinking of my <br/>\nexperiences with people I have known. I have know people who argue that their <br/>\ndoctrine is the right one, they argue even though no one is challenging them <br/>\nor wanting to debate it. I have known people who do not even want to talk to <br/>\npeople outside their faith. Personally I do not enjoy arguing religion. I do <br/>\nenjoy reading about religions and their histories. For example I did not even <br/>\nrealize that there were still Pagans until I got online. I live in rural Ks <br/>\nwhat can I say. I encouraged the kids to read up on the Pagan religion when <br/>\nthey came to me saying they has met new Pagan epals. I also encouraged them <br/>\nto read up on Buddhism when they had a big interest in Japan. Information <br/>\nwill help them make decisions when they are adults. I cannot force them to <br/>\nfollow me, the time is getting near when they will have to make their own <br/>\nchoices. ( and besides, half the time I am lost anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe in being kind to everyone, no matter what. I try hard not to judge. <br/>\nBeing non judgmental is one of humanities biggest hurdles I think. <br/>\nDo not let the views on this list make you angry. This is a good list and I <br/>\nwould hate to see it go. Keep in mind that when expressing an opinion <br/>\nfeelings could be hurt. So be careful <br/>\nHave a great day<br/>\n<br/>\npeace and grace<br/>\nCandy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Ouuui7lVsnRgNwLgUHC5TpgavsfaOsH4x_a_d_p1d7rwB3Uni6sDJpMWD0y7X59pEvcLDHBw6TFw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Religion and Homeschooling","postDate":"973565906","msgId":14023,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQuYzIyZjdiYy4yNzM4YzlkMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":14010,"nextInTopic":14025,"prevInTime":14022,"nextInTime":14024,"topicId":13897,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 00-11-05 13:28:28 EST, you write: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-688568092\">In a message dated 00-11-05 13:28:28 EST, you write:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I dont feel you should make such comments about someones religion!<br/>\n Her beliefs are very powerful and not make believe. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich person do you think I potentially offended?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&lt;   It was<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  very upsetting for my son to be called a devil<br/>\n&gt;  worshipper by other school children. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>WAS her son a devil worshipper?<br/>\nI don&#39;t think so.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point was the only people who seem to even believe in the devil are <br/>\nChristians (and some Christians/former Christians who really truly want to <br/>\nirritate their parents and so they &quot;become&quot; Satan worshippers for a while, <br/>\nbut I certainly know of no second generation Satanists, nor even any longterm <br/>\nSatanists.

I wish I had such a legacy to impart to my children.  However, being a multi-European mix, with no particular family culture, religion, history, etc to pass on, I have very little to offer them in terms of heritage.  I have only one grandparent, and have not spent much time with her in my life, plus she is not the storyteller type.  My parents are also.......less than forthcoming about family history, nor do I enjoy spending much time with them due to their dysfunctionality.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT!!  I can pass on my own spiritual and religious beliefs that I have developed in my life.  We create our own family traditions to pass on to our children.  We are what is generally called &quot;eclectic Pagans&quot; with beliefs mixed from all the influences that are important in our lives.  We practice a mix of European traditions and Native American traditions, being Americans with European roots.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"adarl52357@aol.com","from":"adarl52357@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"q-V7X5Ihv5JJSZb9bQ1Dc8u3Nxia_r9waWYF0f9BE5YE6exBIyoyegAtyQostXOzmcjp99JtCqNf","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:Religion and Homeschooling","postDate":"973183392","msgId":13922,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhlLmM4OTQ1NjIuMjczMmYzYTBAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":13902,"nextInTopic":13923,"prevInTime":13921,"nextInTime":13923,"topicId":13897,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We are followers of a living saint from India known as Ammachi and are part of a Hindu Satsang in the San Francisco Bay area.
