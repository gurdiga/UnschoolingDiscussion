I don&#39;t think her parents ever knew that<br/>\nwhen she was young. She learned to read late. She said<br/>\nit was always a struggle to keep the words still on<br/>\nthe page. She learned to read by word recognition not<br/>\nby the shapes of the letters. She is still challenged<br/>\nby spelling. Yet she learned how to read with out any<br/>\nintervention. That is what I as unschooler wants to<br/>\nknow. Later she did get identified with a rare form of<br/>\nsomething I don&#39;t really know of it fell in the<br/>\nDyslexic label or not. She wears a special form of<br/>\nglasses  that helps calm the words on the page down or<br/>\ncalms her eyes down and helps the messages reach her<br/>\nbrain more clearly. Later in her life it was helpful<br/>\nto know she had a physical problem with reading so she<br/>\ncould get help. Just like we would go get glasses for<br/>\na kid who was near sighted or far sighted. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t go get glasses for a kid early to prevent<br/>\nthe child from getting poor eye sight that might<br/>\nactually be the wrong thing to do. It might more<br/>\nlikely ensure a childs eyesight becomes weeker. So we<br/>\nmight want to know if Dyslexia runs in the family to<br/>\nknow if our kids has it just in case there is<br/>\nsomething we could do to make it easier. Like the<br/>\nglasses my friend wears. My friend did learn to read<br/>\nwithout them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one of my kids had dyslexia I don&#39;t think I would<br/>\never sit down and do the lesson ideas or a program<br/>\nwith them in a real formal way like it happens in<br/>\nschools. I would probably read up more about it and<br/>\nfind a way to help without her knowing it. I would<br/>\nalso allow room for a late reader. If a kid has<br/>\ndyslexia this a problem that never goes away. They<br/>\nwill likely always struggle with reading. Or it might<br/>\ntake a person who has dyslexia longer to read. It<br/>\nseems to me over focusing on the problem would make<br/>\nreading more of a chore more of an issue. A kid who<br/>\nwas unschooled would hopefully never get the stigma of<br/>\nthe dyslexic label. They would be allowed to follow<br/>\ntheir passions that don&#39;t require lots of reading.<br/>\nThey would naturally figure out methods to learn<br/>\nthings they want to learn without reading. When they<br/>\nfinally wanted to learn to read or learn to read<br/>\nbetter they would. Reading would be a tool for them.<br/>\nSo they would learn better how to use the reading<br/>\ntool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSamantha<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

But to answer the question, however<br/>\nsnidely (or would that be snarkily) put, for starters, dyslexia does not<br/>\nmean &quot;difficulty reading.&quot;  That is a ps definition put out there by<br/>\nnon-medically trained personnel intent on getting more special ed money.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder the dyslexia umbrella are:<br/>\n<br/>\nDyslexia - a language-based disability in which a person has trouble<br/>\nunderstanding words, sentences or paragraphs; both oral and written language<br/>\nare affected.<br/>\n<br/>\nDyscalculia - a mathematical disability in which a person has unusual<br/>\ndifficulty solving arithmetic problems and grasping math concepts.<br/>\n<br/>\nDysgraphia - a neurological-based writing disability in which a person finds<br/>\nit hard to form letters or write within a defined space.<br/>\n<br/>\nDyslexics are visual, multi-dimensional thinkers sometimes described as<br/>\n&quot;intuitive and highly creative, and excel at hands-on learning.&quot;  They think<br/>\nin pictures, so it is sometimes hard for them to understand letters,<br/>\nnumbers, symbols, and the spoken and written words.<br/>\n<br/>\nDyslexia is a congenital and developmental condition which creates<br/>\nneurological anomalies in the brain. These anomalies bring about varying<br/>\ndegrees of difficulty in learning when using words, and sometimes symbols.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 60% of dyslexic people have phonological difficulties--difficulties<br/>\nsorting out the sounds within words.  This isn&#39;t limited to problems with<br/>\nreading, writing and spelling.  The majority of dyslexic children have<br/>\ndifficulty with language, memory and sequencing processes of basic<br/>\nmathematics.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then you are the resident expert on learning disabilities, so you knew<br/>\nall that, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Julie Stauffer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jnjstau@...\">jnjstau@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 29, 2001 9:39 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Real dyslexia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Yessiree folks, we have once again been cornered by Head of Ranch<br/>\nSecurity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tell us Hank, exactly what is &quot;real dyslexia&quot;?
