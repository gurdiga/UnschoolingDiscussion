Can&#39;t anything be unhealthy if it is a substitution for<br/>\nexperiencing life, I mean, if it is a coping mechanism we turn to instead<br/>\nof dealing with our problems?  Just like gambling or eating or other<br/>\npotential addictions.  Most addictions are just a dampener for pain, a<br/>\nfalse stimulant or sedative.<br/>\nOn the other hand, everyone eats.  Can&#39;t gambling just be simple<br/>\nentertainment?  So what I&#39;m saying is, tv can be unhealthy, but it can<br/>\nalso be healthy.  Couldn&#39;t watching tv for a while help us get through a<br/>\ngrieving stage?  TV can be educational and entertaining.<br/>\nSpeaking of addictions, the book The Alcoholic Personality said that<br/>\npeople who, either by neglect or too much control, never developed<br/>\nself-discipline were potentials for alcoholic personalities.  That is why<br/>\nwe talk about why&#39;s, give information and let the children participate in<br/>\ncoming up with solutions.  I want my son to learn independence, but<br/>\nsometimes it is too stressful for him to make some choices.  So, I will<br/>\nsit with him and do a pro&#39;s and con&#39;s list to help him learn<br/>\ndecisionmaking.  That way he doesn&#39;t feel overburdened with<br/>\nresponsibility or powerless to make a choice.  We also do the serenity<br/>\nprayer for figuring out what we can change and what we cannot change.  <br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24146,"nextTopicId":34593}}
