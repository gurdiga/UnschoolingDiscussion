My name is kama and I am thrilled and <br/>\nproud to be back in the loop.  Our family has homeschooled for three <br/>\nyears (some 13 and daughter 11).  Last fall our children determined <br/>\nthat they wanted to go to public school again......with dreaded and <br/>\nreserved acceptance we supported them in their return to the kingdom <br/>\nof tyrrany (my thought anyway).  That was in September and by end of <br/>\nNovember my son started sharing his thoughts of the public <br/>\nsystem.  &quot;I can&#39;t believe that we are there for seven hours&quot;,  &quot;I <br/>\ncan&#39;t believe that it takes us forever to do anything&quot;, &quot;I am tired <br/>\nof waiting for everyone and everything&quot;, &quot;they keep us all in one <br/>\nplace&quot;, and &quot;they even have a fence around everything to keep us <br/>\nthere&quot;.  Through this process our son made the choice to leave the <br/>\nsystem and return home and to the world.  I felt very proud and <br/>\nexcited that he had come to a place in his own heart and mind to <br/>\nallow himself to re-enter and re-connect with what was important to <br/>\nhim.  My daughter has decided to finish out the year in Public school <br/>\nand then buiy out of the system.  Anyway, it felt scary to allow that <br/>\npart of the process to happen but the self motivation, self <br/>\nassurance, and self knowledge that my children have obviously carried <br/>\nthem through.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong introduction but I wanted to share my moment.  Hope to be <br/>\nposting, sharing, living, and learning with all of you over the next <br/>\npart of our journey.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31844,"nextTopicId":31845}}
