We&#39;ve<br/>\nswitched over to Lingo voice over internet telephone service (~$25/mo),<br/>\nwhich gives us unlimited long distance to the US, Canada, and most of<br/>\nWestern Europe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur total home telecoms expense is about $80/mo, which compares favorably<br/>\nwith our old local phone service (which was running us ~$65/month) plus a<br/>\nstandard dialup account (say AOL, at $25/mo).  And we have the whole wealth<br/>\nof the Internet available to everyone in the house, as fast as we could like<br/>\nit - and we can call our relatives and former exchange students at no<br/>\nadditional expense.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore we went wireless, I had run wires through much of the house, and I<br/>\ncan tell you for certain that wireless is easier.  Do read up a bit on<br/>\nsecuring your wireless network (the key acronym here is &quot;WEP&quot; - wireless<br/>\nencryption protocol), as otherwise hackers passing by on the street may be<br/>\nable to see into your computers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your existing computers are not set up for wireless access, you can add a<br/>\ncard to handle it for about $10-15 per machine.  (Adding a card like this to<br/>\na laptop is as simple as plugging it in to the side of the machine; a<br/>\ndesktop is only a tiny bit harder, really!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a large house, be aware that wireless networking does have a<br/>\nsomewhat limited range -- more than a few dozen feet away, or any<br/>\nsubstantial amounts of metalwork in the intervening walls, and you may lose<br/>\nyour network signal, or suffer slowed-down connections.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sincerely hope that this helps -- finally, a topic here that I actually<br/>\nknow a bit about!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lars D.
