Visit <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.SaveHemp.org\">http://www.SaveHemp.org</a><br/>\n&gt; to send your second round of letters today!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Under the DEA&#39;s proposed regulation, literally millions of Americans<br/>\n&gt; will be criminalized for possessing shampoos, lotions, and soaps that<br/>\n&gt; have the slightest amount of naturally occurring THC, the primary<br/>\n&gt; active ingredient in marijuana. (It is impossible to get a<br/>\n&gt; psychoactive effect from hemp-based shampoos and soaps, but the DEA is<br/>\n&gt; proposing to ban them nevertheless.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Those who are arrested for shampoo or soap will face up to one year in<br/>\n&gt; federal prison and a $10,000 fine -- the same penalties they would<br/>\n&gt; face if they were arrested for possessing a small amount of marijuana.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If someone is arrested with a stockpile of (currently legal) hemp<br/>\n&gt; products that weighs hundreds of pounds, it stands to reason that<br/>\n&gt; the defendant would face a 5- or 10-year mandatory minimum prison<br/>\n&gt; sentence -- or even the death penalty -- under federal law.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are already 700,000 arrests every year in the U.S. for marijuana<br/>\n&gt; offenses. Our nation&#39;s beleaguered criminal justice system doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; need the additional strain of processing 100,000&#39;s of additional<br/>\n&gt; arrests that will result from the illegal possession of non-<br/>\n&gt; psychoactive shampoos and soaps.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We don&#39;t need another front in our nation&#39;s failed war on drugs.<br/>\n&gt; Please oppose the DEA&#39;s hemp ban before it is allowed to take effect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In urgency,<br/>\n&gt; Coalition to Save Hemp<br/>\n&gt; www.SaveHemp.org<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S. Please distribute this message as widely as you can. Thank you!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15046,"nextTopicId":15053}}
