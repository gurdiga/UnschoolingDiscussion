Tomorrow, <br/>\nthough, is supposed to be around +15, so that is making a move in <br/>\nthe proper direction.

My kids are little, so taking them outside in below zero <br/>\nweather is not a very good idea I think.  Even my dogs, who are <br/>\nfurry like polar bears, think it is a bit chilly.  At this point, we <br/>\nare watching quite a lot of cartoons and playing computer games.  <br/>\nOnce in awhile we&#39;ll look through a book on sea life or something, <br/>\nand, since we are practically in our pajamas 24 hours a day when it <br/>\nis this cold, even that seems like a bit much in the effort <br/>\ndepartment.  Cold makes us lazy.  Hopefully tomorrow we&#39;ll be out <br/>\nice skating or something.  The fact that you don&#39;t have to go to an <br/>\nice rink and pay is a bonus -- free skating right outdoors, <br/>\nimagine!  Enjoy your 19 degree weather.

I had to then explain to him that <br/>\nalthough there&#39;s really no such thing as a &quot;bad&quot; word, there are words that <br/>\nyou might say in the company of someone else&#39;s mother that will cause you <br/>\nnot to be invited over to play anymore and you can end up losing a <br/>\nfriend.  I also cautioned him that sometimes using words off the above list <br/>\nto express anger can become a habit (as is often demonstrated for us by <br/>\nLiam&#39;s dad) that&#39;s hard to break, and words can leak out of our mouths <br/>\nbefore we&#39;ve had a chance to turn them into something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nWatching the movie &quot;The Christmas Story&quot; this past year was very helpful in <br/>\nillustrating these points.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiam really got it and does not use &quot;shut up,&quot;  but you&#39;d blush to hear the <br/>\ninsults he comes up with when he&#39;s playing a particularly challenging <br/>\nNintendo game.
