I have 9 years worth of pictures with <br/>\nher at (or on) the sideboard in the dining room with a vase full of them. <br/>\nSeveral years ago, after she had internalized that the blooms meant her <br/>\nbirthday was at hand,  I mentioned to her that they bloomed a week after the <br/>\nfirst writing spiders appeared.  Serious birthday cake planning now begins <br/>\nwith the first writing spider.  She observed and recorded a year or two <br/>\nlater that preying mantises appear 2 weeks after the resurrection lilies. <br/>\nShe appears to be correct, at least as far as the indicator of when I have a <br/>\nmantis in a jar on the kitchen window.  All of this depends on which day it <br/>\nrains, but the general time line is dependable.  I am less sure of her <br/>\ndependability in sexing the things, but he assures me she can and will <br/>\nmanage to breed some this fall.  Why not???<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is remarkable to me as an involved but non interfering observer is the <br/>\nsheer number of these observations she has made - and made her own.  When <br/>\nshe was 4 she could look at caterpillar poop and tell you whether the <br/>\ncaterpillar was ready to cocoon and metamorphose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love unschooling for a whole bunch of reasons and love my daughter for <br/>\nmany more, but the connections like naked lady lilies and a whole host of <br/>\n&quot;unteachable&quot; learning skills rank pretty high in the why element of that <br/>\nlove for unschooling.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 09, 2005 9:06 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] MOONFLOWER BLOOMED!  and a mystery <br/>\nflower<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; That link said this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lycoris radiata (Dwarf Surprise Lily)<br/>\n&gt; Sun to Light ShadeZone: 6-10, at least 15&quot; tall Origin: China<br/>\n&gt; This Southern heirloom bulb is one of the most popular plants in old <br/>\n&gt; Southern<br/>\n&gt; gardens. The small, narrow strap-like blue-green leaves die away in early<br/>\n&gt; spring. Then seemingly out of nowhere in August, the 15&quot; tall spikes <br/>\n&gt; emerge from<br/>\n&gt; underground, topped with a deciduous azalea-like flower of bright red. <br/>\n&gt; After<br/>\n&gt; the flowers fade, the leaves emerge again and persist until spring, <br/>\n&gt; producing<br/>\n&gt; food for next year&#39;s flowering. L. radiata doesn&#39;t always flower every<br/>\n&gt; year...we feel the flowering is probably controlled by aliens who like to <br/>\n&gt; torment<br/>\n&gt; Earth-bound gardeners.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I LOVE that, because Holly said maybe the aliens sent it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My neighbor, when I asked him, didn&#39;t know but said &quot;Maybe those lights on<br/>\n&gt; the crest the other night caused it&quot; (people reported strange lights one <br/>\n&gt; night;<br/>\n&gt; it was a mountaintop photo shoot with bright lighting at night, we heard)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m definitely going to dig it up and move it to a safer place.   Maybe it<br/>\n&gt; would have bloomed other years but Keith mows the lawn.   The bulbs we <br/>\n&gt; planted<br/>\n&gt; there were planted seven or eight years ago, and after that we&#39;ve moved <br/>\n&gt; every<br/>\n&gt; one we saw come up to better places.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
