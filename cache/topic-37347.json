A<br/>\nsoda bottle? I guess I&#39;ll be going to HOme Depot instead of Walmart today!<br/>\nThanks for the advice.\r<br/>\nBeth\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOne tip, if you use straight baking soda and vinegar for your \r<br/>\neruptions it is rather spectacular.  It acts somewhat like a stromboli \r<br/>\neruption.  If you add a bit of dishsoap to the solution the eruption \r<br/>\nis more steady (and I can&#39;t think of the name of that type of eruption \r<br/>\nto save my life right now!) like Mt Kilowea (I suspect that is spelled \r<br/>\nwrong)\r<br/>\nWe build ours on a plywood base out, with a chicken wire frame and \r<br/>\nthat plater wrap stuff they sell in the craft stores - looks like the \r<br/>\nstuff they used to make casts out of.  They we painted it with acrylic \r<br/>\npaints and sealed it with polyurethane sealer.  It lasted for years!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBridget\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
