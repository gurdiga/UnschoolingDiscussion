I <br/>\ntried to calmly explain (again!) that we don&#39;t use textbooks, and the only <br/>\nones I had for them was for math.  This is course, brought on alot of <br/>\nyelling, since they have given me tons of public school textbooks for all <br/>\ngrades and subjects.  I had to admit that yes, we still have them, but they <br/>\nare put away in a closet and we don&#39;t use them.!  My parents were furious, my <br/>\nkids crying and begging me not to make them go to grandmas and grandpas <br/>\nanymore, which just made my parents more angry, as they blamed that on me as <br/>\nwell (Couldn&#39;t they see that their attitude about my kids and school work <br/>\nwere pushing them away?).  I just had to quit, I couldn&#39;t handle it.  <br/>\nNeedless to say, my kids are not being taught anything by their grandparents <br/>\nany more.<br/>\n     Do you know what the really tough thing is about all of this?  <br/>\nRegardless of how upset I get on the way they treat me and the kids, I really <br/>\nlove them!

Instead they assume that <br/>\nall children should learn to read in first grade, because the public school <br/>\nsystem teaches it then.  Automatically, they expect the same of <br/>\nhomeschoolers.  It doesn&#39;t do any good to talk about why, or bring up John <br/>\nHolts ideas, you just end up getting stranger looks than they already give <br/>\nyou for homeschooling.

If they ask something that my kids don&#39;t know, I just say <br/>\nthat we haven&#39;t covered that yet.  If it is a stranger, I try to change the <br/>\nsubject and go on.  In my case, my family seems to do most of this.  <br/>\nSometimes they ask questions when I am not around, so they can put my kids on <br/>\nthe spot.  Then they come back to me and complain about the things I haven&#39;t <br/>\ncovered yet.  They have even jumped all over my kids, saying that they should <br/>\nhave learned that by now!  It makes me so mad!  Usually, I have just taken it <br/>\nquietly, without really defending ourselves, but lately I have politely asked <br/>\nthem to quit quizing my kids.  I ask them if they feel like they need to quiz <br/>\npublic school kids like that.  The problem is that my relatives get mad and <br/>\nsay they are doing it because they love my kids and then they say &quot;you <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want us not to care about them would you?&quot;  How frustrating!

I <br/>\nthink they accept my homeschooling my youngest child, much more easily than <br/>\nthey do my teenagers.<br/>\n     I am with you.  That story was scary.
