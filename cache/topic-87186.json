It think anyone who went to <br/>\nschool at ANY level, up to grad school, knows there are people like that.   <br/>\nAnd knowing that, then just a piece of paper doesn&#39;t make &#39;an expert.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone really does know and care about a subject, what I respect is the <br/>\ncool ideas he or she has and the way in which they&#39;re expressed.  If a person <br/>\ncan make a subject really accessible and fascinating to others, then that&#39;s <br/>\nsomething to care about.  Lots of times those people have college degrees or <br/>\nyears in the field, but sometimes they don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sometimes someone is new to something and comes up with an incredible <br/>\ninsight that changes the lives around them and changes the knowledge base of <br/>\nexperts, who go back to their drawing boards and research and change what they <br/>\nthought they knew.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyone, whether a college student or doctoral candidate or ten year old, <br/>\nwho trusts one source instead of waiting/thinking/trying/looking further, is <br/>\nnot doing much thinking, is doing NO research, and is not (in my opinion) <br/>\nearning trust or faith.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is that something to argue against?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe there&#39;s any field which consists of all upright and competent <br/>\npractitioners.

There are <br/>\nreading experts who have never even TRIED to teach a child to read.

They won&#39;t add the current cutting edge theories, though.  <br/>\nPeople in ten or fifteen years will include today&#39;s theories in those that <br/>\ndidn&#39;t work.
