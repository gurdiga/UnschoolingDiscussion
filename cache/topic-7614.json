Way back when he was a child his Mother was very frugal, <br/>\nshe was divorced but never took a job, instead she rented rooms <br/>\nand lived simply.  This rubbed off on Dick and he worked many <br/>\nhours as a teen, was in the marines for three years during the <br/>\nKorean thing, and saved most of his money and had a sizeable <br/>\nsum to put down as a deposit on the farm.   She was a keen <br/>\ngardener and knew the benefits of adding organic matter to the <br/>\nsandy soil to improve it.  This has turned Dick into an organic <br/>\nfanatic, you should see the size of our compost pile...  we even <br/>\ncomposted the neighbours dead cow!!   She was very interested in <br/>\nbirds and at an early age Dick learned all he could about birds in <br/>\nan unschooled way.   Also his Mother was a very tidy person, and <br/>\nwhile this didn&#39;t rub off onto him the desire for order did, making for <br/>\nsome frustrations, as sometimes we have a bit too much to do <br/>\nhere for the place to be kept orderly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo hopefully he may now look at the role of stay-at-home parents <br/>\nof any gender as the most important job there is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-  Sue   -<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Winona Farm in Minnesota Welcomes Unschoolers All Year Round<br/>\nMy website:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e\">http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e</a><br/>\nFarm website:    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homepage.rconnect.com/winfarm\">http://homepage.rconnect.com/winfarm</a><br/>\nFarm newsletter: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To believe in something, and not to live it, is to be dishonest.&quot;<br/>\n-Mahatma Gandhi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Joshua Heath","from":"&quot;Joshua Heath&quot; &lt;heathfam@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"BE-jbZjyAp88J_Q60mLhTihDLqb8lXSDFyxpWVaEBPeCzB6eNrchyCVEFHy8wpvNU2UaA7E7eU3uS-ft8tyEMjnwZxkkThlfsVM","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Domestic dads Out of Hiding","postDate":"954566799","msgId":7614,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNmIwMWJmOWI5YiRhMzFkMzYyMCQwODgzNDJkOEBKb3NoSGVhdGg+","referencesHeader":"PDI4MDczLTM4RTU1RTgxLTEzNDNAc3RvcmVmdWxsLTI2NC5pYXAuYnJ5YW50LndlYnR2Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7620,"prevInTime":7613,"nextInTime":7615,"topicId":7614,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... years I would ...
