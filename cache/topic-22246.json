Brit said, once, that she&#39;d like<br/>\nto go to school. I asked why, and she said, &quot;I think they paint more there.&quot;<br/>\n&lt;g&gt; I told her she was welcome to paint as much as she liked at home, and<br/>\nwould that do? It would.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if it *really* came up, it&#39;s my cold sweat issue. On the one hand, I<br/>\ntotally believe that choice is where it&#39;s at. On the other hand, I totally<br/>\nbelieve that for 90% or more of kids, schooling is really, really bad (and<br/>\nsome of the really, really bad happens without them even knowing it, much<br/>\nless knowing to ask to get out of it -- some of the really, really bad is<br/>\nstuff that happens to kids in school-at-home situations, for that matter).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here I fence-sit. &lt;g&gt; Knowing me, it is probable that if they really,<br/>\nreally, REALLY (have I said &quot;really&quot; enough in this post? Really!) wanted to<br/>\ngo, I&#39;d find the best possible school scenario, be ready with subversive<br/>\ncounterpoint &lt;g&gt;, and let them. &quot;You can&#39;t&quot; isn&#39;t a phrase I use much, or<br/>\nwant to.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22193,"nextTopicId":22255}}
