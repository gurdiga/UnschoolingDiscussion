I also<br/>\nbelieve that TV has tons of dribble and the system of commercials promotes<br/>\nrampant consumerism. BUT, here we are, living in this society. I&#39;d rather<br/>\nmake sure my kids have the skills they need to view things critically, so<br/>\nthat when I&#39;m not around they know how to see what&#39;s true and what&#39;s not.<br/>\n<br/>\n I didn&#39;t have a tv myself for many years and didn&#39;t miss it a bit. Now I<br/>\nwatch quite a few shows and I&#39;m happy about that too. TV is just a tool and<br/>\nyou can use it to great advantage. I have seen my kids use tv as a<br/>\n&quot;socializing, community-building and knowledge and resource gathering tool.&quot;<br/>\nThe values that you disagree with are all around us, not just on television.<br/>\nI&#39;ve found that being able to talk with my kids about these messages is the<br/>\nbest way of combating them. Without meaning to be condescending, I have to<br/>\nsay that it is different when you have one four year old than when you have<br/>\nmore and/or older kids. When I had one four year old, we hardly ever watched<br/>\ntv either. But someday (too soon!) you will not be around her all the time<br/>\nand you will not be able to censor what she takes in.<br/>\n<br/>\n I think it&#39;s a bit different if you don&#39;t own a tv or if you have a tv and<br/>\ntry to impose limitations on your kids. I see that you are open to having tv<br/>\nin the future - and open-mindedness is something we&#39;re all shooting for.<br/>\n<br/>\nHoping I made some kind of sense,<br/>\nPaula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62038,"nextTopicId":62130}}
