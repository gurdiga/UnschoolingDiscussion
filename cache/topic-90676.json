Although it does bother me sometimes when he just wants to watch <br/>\nTV, I do agree that he often learns alot from it.<br/>\nNext time we stop at the library we are going to get some of the Cosmos <br/>\nseries by Carl Sagan as he&#39;s been asking about space and meteors alot lately!<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90568,"nextTopicId":90677}}
