Fun but exhausting at times of <br/>\ncourse! For a spaceship I would give Zain a big ole cardboard box and let him <br/>\ndecorate it, etc. I once gave my then-5 yo son some boxes to make a play <br/>\ncastle while i caught 40 winks with my then-newborn son and when i awoke <br/>\nthere was this enormous castle with turrets and doors! I was blown away! Now <br/>\nif i had gotten too involved it would never have been as elaborate or as <br/>\ncreative b/c this particular son gets into power struggles with me very <br/>\neasily. All he needed help with was opening the paints so he could paint it <br/>\nall bright green! We saved that castle setup for at least 5 years. And it was <br/>\nplayed with almost every day, whereas the same sort of cardboard castle <br/>\nstructure that we bought at a medieval festival last summer has yet to be <br/>\nplayed with! Also my crowd likes to play spaceship every time they see a <br/>\nlaundry basket! They dump out the laundry (grrrr!) and jump inside and shout <br/>\nblast off! sometimes the basket is upside down on top of them! But if i had <br/>\never suggested this i am sure the game would never have been repeated! In our <br/>\nhouse the bed is the moon, Michelle! Have fun!<br/>\nBridget<br/>\nHomeschooling Tim, 13, Christian,7, Jeremiah, 5, and Emmanuelle 17 months</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"A. Yates","from":"&quot;A.
