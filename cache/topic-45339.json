Upon deeper investigation, we find there are <br/>\nnumerous things about Canadian culture, and Toronto in particualr, that <br/>\ninterest and intrigue us. It&#39;s a very diverse city, very clean, has a <br/>\ncomparably low crime rate, good opportunities for hubby&#39;s employment, <br/>\ngood value for our money, favorable laws with regard to homeschooling, <br/>\nnon-vaccinizing (I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a word, lol), gun control, <br/>\nparental rights, etc, etc. It will of course demand more intensive <br/>\nresearch before a final decision is reached, but I&#39;m psyched to even <br/>\nTHINK about a nice, emphatic change of lifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust out of curiosity, are any listers from Toronto or other Canadian <br/>\nregions?<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nSally<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Friday, October 4, 2002, at 01:29  PM, MO Milligans wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;we&#39;ve recently been considering a move to Toronto in the next few <br/>\n&gt; years.<br/>\n&gt; ==<br/>\n&gt; If&#39;n you don&#39;t mind me askin&#39;, is there any particular reason, or is it<br/>\n&gt; just somewhere you&#39;ve always wanted to try and live in?
