Here are four methods you can use to<br/>\nestimate an egg&#39;s age.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Air-cell size increases as an egg ages. A freshly laid egg has no air<br/>\ncell. As the egg cools, its contents shrink, forming a cell or pocket at the<br/>\nlarge end of the egg. As moisture evaporates from the egg, its contents<br/>\ncontinue to shrink and the air cell grows. Candling an egg to measure the<br/>\nair cell will give you an idea of the egg&#39;s age. The cell of a freshly laid,<br/>\ncool egg will be no more than 1/8-inch deep.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Floating an egg in plain water lets you gauge its air-cell size without<br/>\ncandling. A fresh egg will settle to the bottom of the container and rest<br/>\nhorizontally. The larger air cell of a 1-week-old egg will cause the big end<br/>\nof the egg to rise slightly from the container bottom. An egg that&#39;s 2 to 3<br/>\nweeks old will settle to the bottom of the container vertically, big end<br/>\nupward.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Someone else adds: if the egg floats on the surface, it it should be<br/>\ndiscarded.)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Smell is the quickest way to detect the age of a very old egg. A rotting<br/>\negg emits foul-smelling hydrogen sulfide, otherwise known as rotten-egg gas.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Breaking an egg and examining its contents is another way to estimate the<br/>\negg&#39;s age. A fresh egg has cloudy, firm albumen that holds the yolk up high;<br/>\na stale egg has clear, watery albumen that spreads out thinly around the<br/>\nyolk. The older the egg is, the greater the likelihood that its yolk will<br/>\nbreak. However, this test isn&#39;t foolproof, as even the freshest egg<br/>\noccasionally has a watery white or an easily broken yolk.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1694471,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","profile":"anoydami","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] the big egg question!","postDate":"1019448686","msgId":35557,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZTMwMWMxZTliYSRjN2I4MDdjMCQzNjVkZDFkMUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PEI4RThCNzVGLjlDNCVhYnRsZW9AZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":35542,"nextInTopic":35566,"prevInTime":35556,"nextInTime":35558,"topicId":35527,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Actually, the inspectors have found that quite of few of the eggs out there are not only stale, they have been returned to the distributor and then been put in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1902018922\">Actually, the inspectors have found that quite of few of the eggs out there<br/>\nare not only stale, they have been returned to the distributor and then been<br/>\nput in a new carton with a new age dating stamp.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Alan & Brenda Leonard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abtleo@...\">abtleo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, April 21, 2002 4:39 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] the big egg question!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Blech!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll take my eggs stale, from now on, if I take them at all!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But Kate!<br/>\n&gt; If that same drop of blood showed up in our chicken at dinner time, we&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; only assume it needed a few more seconds in the microwave to finish<br/>\ncooking!<br/>\n&gt; :)<br/>\n&gt; brenda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
