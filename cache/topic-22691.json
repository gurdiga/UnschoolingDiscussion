(Maybe your library has it.)  The story describes<br/>\na girl who just wants to pick wild fruit and eat it, but instead, she&#39;s<br/>\nsent to some kind of school where to &quot;prepare&quot; her for learning, she has<br/>\nto eat big, unappetizing piles of cafeteria food as &quot;eating practice&quot;. <br/>\nIt&#39;s an interesting way to start a discussion about different styles of<br/>\nlearning.  It demonstrates vividly how trying to force learning can<br/>\nreally kill the learning &quot;appetite&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nA similar comparison is from Ivan Illych said a worksheet is like taking<br/>\na vitamin C tablet, while learning from life is eating the whole orange.<br/>\n Which is healthier, more natural and more appetizing?  (I&#39;m<br/>\nparaphrasing and have a bad memory.  If someone can quote more<br/>\naccurately that&#39;s great.  I heard Pat Farenga quote this part in an<br/>\naudiotape from the Sacramento conference.  He&#39;s speaking there about<br/>\nunschooling again this August.  www.hsc.org   , for people in or near California.)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!   Your daughter should bounce back just fine, but you might<br/>\nwant to search for information on &quot;deschooling&quot;.  Especially on the<br/>\nunschooling.com message boards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: New to list","postDate":"1052788688","msgId":68774,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3MC4xZTg2Yzk1NC4yYmYxYTFkMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68765,"nextInTopic":68912,"prevInTime":68773,"nextInTime":68775,"topicId":22691,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/12/03 6:50:39 PM, glmnw@winco.net writes:  Yes.

Our county will give you support information on raising the chicks. I believe it is geared towards fifth and sixth graders. check to see if your county has an agricultural exchange center.

That is one reason we were going to get into the 4-H, because we need to buy them and hopefully 4-H would give us some connections. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thanks to everyone for the warm welcome :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\nBronwen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Johanna","from":"&quot;Johanna&quot; &lt;saninocencio1@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"MeDUNGi4r_4lEmoVxZSrfNzg-dO361AYgkxiIORwOkF2lC0JbT-q_oqblJV7G0Zq7RXcPS7OPEIS58u86_hKm045mWsJjEPmPWcslA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] New to list","postDate":"993272682","msgId":22709,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwODMwMWMwZmJhMyRjMWRlODI4MCQyMDdjZDdhYUBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGFiLmIzNTEyZmUuMjg2NGEwNzhAYW9sLmNvbT4gPDAwNDYwMWMwZmIzYyRmOGFhNjUyMCRhYTE0MTVkMUB1c2VyPg=="},"prevInTopic":22701,"nextInTopic":22710,"prevInTime":22708,"nextInTime":22710,"topicId":22691,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Welcome Bronwen.
