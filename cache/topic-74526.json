He often called his underwear his &#39;panties&#39; <br/>\njust from hearing us say it so much and I tend to call his unders panties <br/>\ntoo, just makes life easier I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Ethan came along he couldn&#39;t wait for him to start wearing underwear so <br/>\nhe wouldn&#39;t have to call them panties anymore, on purpose or by accident.  <br/>\nEthan just turned three and we also now have Caeleb who is 2 but neither are <br/>\nout of diapers yet.  Funny thing is, Ethan and Caeleb both call them <br/>\npanties!!
