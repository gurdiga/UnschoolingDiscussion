I used to <br/>\nbelieve those studies about tv and we definitely limited it. What convinced me to <br/>\nchange my mind was realizing that the warnings to not let your kids watch more then<br/>\n2 hrs/day were based on kids who were in school all day. Betw school and homework,<br/>\nif kids were watching more then 2 hrs/day, they most likely were not doing much else.<br/>\nFor our kids, 2 hrs/day is really not much when you look at all the &quot;free&quot; time they<br/>\nhave. There is tons of time for them to do other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe lifted restrictions on tv back in october and it has worked great. They definitely<br/>\nwatch more then the 1 hr/day I previously let them, but I have found that they<br/>\nare now doing other things while watching (previously my oldest (6 yo) would<br/>\npretty much sit transfixed). Now he builds legos, bounces on his mini trampoline,<br/>\nplays with his brother etc. Much of the time the tv is more background noise. I have<br/>\nalso noticed that they do use the tv to relax...after we have had a really exciting day<br/>\nand also to transition to waking up in the morning (all 3 of us usually cuddle on the <br/>\ncouch and watch blue&#39;s clues). <br/>\n<br/>\nThings I have also noticed is that they don&#39;t fight when we have to go somewhere and<br/>\nturn off the tv. When my ILs were visiting, they hardly turned it on at all (my ILs<br/>\nlove playing with the boys). It is pretty easy to get them involved in other things<br/>\n(mainly with the tv on). The tv no longer goes on first thing when we get home and <br/>\nJason has started asking me to put on music. I have seen no loss in creativity...they<br/>\nstill like to do lots of stuff.

I agree with everyone that setting limits for or restricting our children can cause problems.  But, I think before we can come up with an answer for ourselves on what to do about TV, we need to answer the question- What is really wrong with TV anyway?  The book &quot;The Plug-In Drug: Television, Children, and the Family&quot; is listed under resources in Mary Griffith&#39;s book &quot;the unschooling handbook&quot; it is said to be a classic on why television is bad for children and for the family.  I have not read the book but I have come up with my own opinions.  Mainly the potential for the *over* exposure to outside influences that promote ideas that are destructive.  Ideas such as - happiness comes from buying things, that women should use their bodies to get what they want (instead of their minds), that there is no shame in promiscuity and sex is fun and there are no boundaries as long as it feels good.  My dh and I do use every opportunity to discuss  our values and to expose things on TV for what they are but I put too-much-TV in the same category as ps peer pressure.  I&#39;m afraid if there is *too much* exposure nothing I say will matter.  Which brings me to compare TV to ps.  In my mind there are similarities.  The children are captive audiences to some things that may influence them negatively.  Certainly there are many good things on TV as there can be some good things about ps.   Another thing that concerns me is the effect on the developing brain of a child.  Would the child&#39;s brain be better off (such as with breast milk) if there was a limit to TV exposure?  We have found that watching TV on the weekends only has worked for us.  The kids do not ask for TV all the time because they have found other things to do during the week and they do not miss it but they don&#39;t feel cheated either since they get to watch a fair amount.  Just with watching TV on the weekends (2-3 hrs. a night) my kids watch 4-6 hours a week.  That is still a lot but I think there is a balance.  Thanks for listening.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPat  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JAROCKI9@...\">JAROCKI9@...</a> <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Monday, December 31, 2001 12:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] tv<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 12/30/01 8:59:33 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:naake1999@...\">naake1999@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; And <br/>\nsome of the smartest and most successful adults I knew spent plenty of time <br/>\nin front of the TV when they were kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI follow this philosophy myself, yet I still wonder if this is a valid <br/>\nargument.

It would be easier if the desserts weren&#39;t anywhere around. <br/>\nBut wouldn&#39;t it be *great* if you could get to a point where it didn&#39;t *matter* if the desserts were there or not!  .... a point where you could take &#39;em or leave &#39;em. <br/>\nWhat would it take to make the desserts a non-attraction? I know if I stuffed myself with them and got really OD&#39;d on sugar, I would probably not have any desire for more sweets for quite some time. (I can say this with confidence as I just *did* this over the holidays!).<br/>\nSo with tv, what would it take to make it a non-attraction? Some people are trying not having cable. Others are trying no tv in the house at *all*.  Still others are not setting any limits on tv to de-mystify it. In my house ( and speaking only for myself & family), I find that if I totally remove tv, then the first chance they get to *see* one, they&#39;re glued to it and fail to interact with the family we&#39;re visiting. So, we don&#39;t do tv limits for that reason.<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">  ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Pat Cald... <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, December 30, 2001 9:21 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: tv was: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: grandparents<br/>\n  Since we are pondering some questions here .... How powerful is the power of suggestion?  If I went on a diet, and decided not to eat desserts until I lost the weight I needed to lose, which way would be easier, if the temptation was limited or if everyone ate dessert in front of me every night.  Now I know you are going to say that eventually I will be tempted and need to learn to deal with it and you will be right but by then hopefully there will be other positive reinforcements to help.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Pat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Rachel Wolfe Ravenhart","from":"Rachel Wolfe Ravenhart &lt;ravenhart@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"5bxXhaTNvfjfe-8fzcMUySPkCg-op0t5ORX3wb6Uj8OuR070MPXzQB605xjvof8QldnvsIAkiL4D3yDwd97fAp-l4km5S6AcpWUAev66m6mvNg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] tv","postDate":"999990834","msgId":24673,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNCOUFBNjMxLkU4Q0VBQkFGQGhvbWUuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PExBVzItRjIyOHZyZXhWVHhCbkMwMDAxNDQ3MkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30472,"prevInTime":24671,"nextInTime":24674,"topicId":24673,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Wild Thornberrys rocks! *G* I LOVE Tim Curry and Lacey Chalbert! *G* Rachel Ravenhart ...
