The way I understand it, if a child freely CHOOSES to <br/>\ngo to school, then that is still unschooling. I would go a degree <br/>\nfarther and also suggest that if parents and children have a family <br/>\nmeeting and mutually and respectfully arrive at the decision that <br/>\nhaving the children enroll in school temporarily for whatever reason <br/>\n(financial or otherwise) in a necessity, then that isn&#39;t something <br/>\nwhich can so easily be criticized.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that in the absence of intimitate knowledge about the <br/>\nFarengas&#39; private lives (specifically in regards to the central <br/>\nquestion of how much input the children had in being sent to school), <br/>\nthe charges that the Farengas are somehow hypocrites and are not <br/>\npracticing what they&#39;re preaching are just pure speculation on the <br/>\ncritics&#39; parts, based on anecdotal evidence and gossip.

It is what we fill in, on lists <br/>\nlike this, and what is filled in by us unschooling-parents who speak at <br/>\nconferences. I wish John Holt had lived to see it - he started the <br/>\nprocess with GWS which was entirely composed of parents&#39; descriptions <br/>\nof their unschooling lives and by holding small meetings with parents <br/>\nwhere he talked AND they talked. He knew that it was parents moving in <br/>\nthe directions he&#39;d pointed to who would really develop unschooling, <br/>\nI&#39;m sure.  I think he&#39;d be thrilled at the organic nature of the <br/>\nunschooling community and how individuals have stepped forward to offer <br/>\ntheir ideas even beyond his and their experiences implementing his <br/>\nideas in their families. When I speak at conferences, I am aware of and <br/>\nfeel very much a part of a process that started with John Holt and GWS.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn wrote about how kids learn math  but it was almost entirely <br/>\nobservation of kids in some kind of institutional learning situation. <br/>\nHe realized that that wasn&#39;t needed and talked about how kids could <br/>\njust learn from their regular life activities and then tackle formal <br/>\nmath and learn it very quickly when they wanted to do so -- but he <br/>\nreally doesn&#39;t talk in enough detail about &quot;how&quot; that natural learning <br/>\nhappens or about what parents can do to support it or at all about what <br/>\nparents who are, themselves, math phobic/anxious, can do to overcome <br/>\nthat. In other words - the practicalities of really BEING a <br/>\nhomeschooling parent were not what he wrote about.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat&#39;s not an educator - he doesn&#39;t work with children other than his <br/>\nown.

He does, <br/>\nimo, a darn GOOD job of speaking in place of John Holt, though. I think <br/>\nPat is a really enjoyable and inspiring speaker. I would feel a little <br/>\nduped, though, to think he was part of talking me INTO unschooling but <br/>\nwasn&#39;t convinced enough to unschool his own kids? Luckily, it couldn&#39;t <br/>\nchange my own mind about unschooling because the only thing that really <br/>\nconvinced me about unschooling was to do it and watch the kids and <br/>\npromise myself never to interrupt what they were doing with &quot;imposed <br/>\nlessons&quot; unless I was convinced that there was nothing at all of value <br/>\ngoing on already.
