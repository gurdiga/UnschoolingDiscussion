A lot of people just buy a cheap<br/>\ntest, have their kid take it, then file it away.  Parents are required to<br/>\nmake a good faith attempt to remedy areas of deficiency.  One woman buys<br/>\nthe test that is a school year below where her children would be<br/>\nage-wise.<br/>\nPeople with more energy, or who like this sort of project, keep a<br/>\nportfolio.  Really just a scrapbook, don&#39;t you think?  Save some of<br/>\nchild&#39;s favorite projects, or a photo if project is 3 dimensional, or a<br/>\nparagraph or two if project has nothing physical to save.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember that these requirements are for others.  Do what you must to<br/>\nfulfill it, while knowing that how you and your children feel about what<br/>\nyou accomplish is what really matters.  As children get older, hand more<br/>\nof this responsibility to them.  ie, &quot;what do you think matters about<br/>\nwhat you did this month?  How can you document it?  (again, sample or<br/>\nphoto or brief write-up).<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nMary Ellen in WA<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>\nTry Juno Web: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3443,"nextTopicId":3485}}
