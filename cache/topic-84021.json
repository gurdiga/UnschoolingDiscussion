She had the watch running whenever there was &quot;real instruction<br/>\nand schoolwork&quot; going on.  When the teacher had to stop and say, &quot;Johnny,<br/>\nkeep your fingers out of your nose&quot;, or &quot;Yes, Suzie?  Yes, you may go to the<br/>\nbathroom, but make it quick&quot; or &quot;Put your reading books away and take out<br/>\nyour math books&quot; or &quot;Settle down, class, settle down&quot; or any other &quot;non<br/>\nteaching&quot; stuff, the clock was not running.  At the end of the day, the<br/>\nstopwatch had ticked off one hour and six minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could relay this story to your mother and explain that since you are one<br/>\non one (or one on 5 or however many kids you have), you don&#39;t have all this<br/>\nadministrative wasted time.  That story gets people&#39;s eyes to pop.  &quot;No<br/>\nwaaaayy....you must be kidding.&quot;  Then I tell them to think back and they<br/>\nsay, &quot;Ewww...you&#39;re right!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, what are kids learning in school from 15 December until 15 January?<br/>\nNOTHING.  Before Christmas is the excitement and concerts and the parties<br/>\nand then there is the 2 week holiday and then when they get back, they have<br/>\nto get back into the swing of things, reviewing all that they forgot over<br/>\nChristmas.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people refuse to use &quot;school speak&quot; on principle.  Sometimes you have<br/>\nto speak another language to get your point across.  You just hafta decide<br/>\nwho deserves your efforts and who might benefit from them and then speak the<br/>\nappropriate language.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523757,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"&quot;Pam Hartley&quot; &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pdhartley2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"re: explaining unschooling (also intro)","postDate":"1068144983","msgId":84021,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMxMTA2MTg1Ni5oQTZJdU5yTTAxNDU1NkBtdGE3LnBsdG4xMy5wYmkubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":84024,"prevInTime":84020,"nextInTime":84022,"topicId":84021,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... month of school by the time we go back home, and that I won t have a single book or assignment for her to stay caught up with...it s going to get rough.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2032892440\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; SO when we go home, and my mother realizes that Sarah&#39;s &quot;missing nearly a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>month of school&quot; by the time we go back home, and that I won&#39;t have a single<br/>\nbook or assignment for her to &quot;stay caught up&quot; with...it&#39;s going to get<br/>\nrough.
