First I would like to say that I had a VERY emotional reaction to the people in traditional (ceremonial) costume.  It was very intense...visceral.  I felt a connection that was tangible.  ( I am supposed to have a not too distant Native American ancestor but we have not been able to find her...yet)  They were/are beautiful.  Really, the words escape me.  Anyway, at the start they had a parade with the American flag and then a prayer ( God/Jesus etc).  It made me ill.  Now I will qualify that I have no problems with the Christian religion (at its purest) and attend a church (whose motto involves respect for other paths to God).  And I certainly love my county (for better or for worst...the good, bad and the ugly etc.)  What did bother me was this just seemed WRONG!!! (both the flag and the prayer).  Now here is the question.  Is this common?  Is there a certain place or certain groups that do not do this.  Is there anywhere in the Eastern region where one (who is not a member of a tribe ) can attend an event that is not adulterated (sorry this is how I feel ) by white culture.  <br/>\nThanks for any input,<br/>\nBeth in MD <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76544,"nextTopicId":76549}}
