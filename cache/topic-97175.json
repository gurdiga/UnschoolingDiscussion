Just last week I <br/>\nbrought in an upholstered chair for Barbie.  It was a homemade wooden chair, made <br/>\nof little lumber scraps and &quot;upholstered&quot; with glued on drapery material.  <br/>\nPretty, but hard as a 2x4.  Barbie doesn&#39;t care.   I wrapped it in tissue paper, <br/>\nput &quot;Barbie&quot; on it, and stuck it back in &quot;Barbieland.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbieland is an under-stairs closet big enough for kids, not big enough for <br/>\nadults, which already had shelves and a light when we moved here.   Holly was <br/>\nsix, and because of my experience with Kirby&#39;s Ninja Turtle figures and their <br/>\ntiny weapons and pizza slices, I knew life would be better for Holly if we <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to negotiate Barbie&#39;s shoes and pizza slices, and if I didn&#39;t have to <br/>\ncheck the vacuum cleaner bag, so we gave her that space and she never had to <br/>\nclean up Barbie stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first it was a floor covered with clothes and parts of stuff, with naked <br/>\nbarbies and kens and Kelly dolls on the shelves.    A couple of times I paid an <br/>\nolder girl $5 to organize it  some.  They had fun, and Holly was thrilled.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, six years later, the shelf sections are various Barbie rooms, some with <br/>\nrugs or carpets, and wall decorations, and the clothes are in little Barbie <br/>\nclosets and drawers, the cars and boats are parked in the back corner (the <br/>\nstairs make a u-turn, so under the landing is the main room where the light is, and <br/>\nparking and storage are  under the short end of the stairs) and nobody&#39;s <br/>\nnaked.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo although I have rarely held a doll and wiggled it and talked, I have often <br/>\nmade sure Holly had a guest, the time, and the space to play Barbies.  She <br/>\nhas something scheduled for this Wednesday.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;That&#39;s the point, I think.  Do what you love with your kids, and that will<br/>\nbe more than enough. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIF...<br/>\nIt&#39;s more than enough if it&#39;s enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome moms might take that as permission to assume the kids will find their <br/>\nown entertainment.   I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good plan for unschoolers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMoms of kids in school have assumed that the kids will get art at school, so <br/>\nthey don&#39;t need to have art supplies; that the kids will get music at school, <br/>\nso they don&#39;t need to provide any musical enrichment; that the kids will have <br/>\na globe at school and maps, so they don&#39;t need to have globes and maps, and so <br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we all know moms who seem to assume kids will play with all their <br/>\nfriends at school and so they don&#39;t need to invite kids over, or let their kids <br/>\ngo play.  They seem to think that making them do homework, watch TV for some <br/>\nmeasured hour or two, bathe and sleep is all they have to do to be good parents. <br/>\n And society will back them up.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers need to provide opportunities for anything they think might be <br/>\nimportant or helpful or necessary. And that&#39;s a lot of responsibility.    Play <br/>\nis part of that.  The parents don&#39;t have to play everything their kids want to, <br/>\nbut they need to import other kids who will, then.   If a kid has a <br/>\ntwo-player video game and the parents can&#39;t or won&#39;t find him a gaming buddy, the <br/>\nparent ought to learn to play it.  It&#39;s as cruel as another cruel thing I&#39;ve seen, <br/>\nwhich is buying kids a board game and then declining to play it with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo sometimes it&#39;s not enough, and most parents could probably stand to do <br/>\nmore.  At least boost the flow of other people through their kids&#39; lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162967824,"authorName":"Dawn Adams","from":"&quot;Dawn Adams&quot; &lt;Wishbone@...&gt;","profile":"bluenosegoddess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Playing","postDate":"1091534384","msgId":97225,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2YwMWM0Nzk1MSQ1ZWJlZjAyMCQ4MzRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGY3LjNkZDAzMDk1LjJlNDA1MTc5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":97221,"nextInTopic":97230,"prevInTime":97224,"nextInTime":97226,"topicId":97175,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Nancy writes: This is sure me too.
