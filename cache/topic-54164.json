Sounds like we are a society that is afraid to love.  I guess the reason we are all so passionate about keeping our children out of school is that we know we all need to love one another more than anything else.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSuzanne (in Illinois too, south burbs)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dacunefare@...\">dacunefare@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, January 10, 2003 12:10 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: independence/mothering<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  **I personally believe that this culture puts too much stress on kids<br/>\n<br/>\n  becoming &quot;independent.&quot; Right after they&#39;re born they&#39;re supposed to go<br/>\n<br/>\n  in a separate bed, in a separate room, separated by school, and later a<br/>\n<br/>\n  job and a new family.

Haven&#39;t you ever <br/>\nasked anyone to do something for you that you can actually do yourself? <br/>\nI am bit surprised by your comments. You sound so cold!**<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone sounds colder and flatter in email, I find.  And talking about<br/>\npersonalities can make the discussion here deteriorate pretty quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**If what we want is to build a relationship based on trust and<br/>\nunderstanding, the attitude that they *should* do it themselves when<br/>\nthey ask for help (read support, love, companionship, comfort,<br/>\ntogetherness, etc.) certainly doesn&#39;t help. I am not sure where you are<br/>\ncoming from and what kind of relationship you want to establish with<br/>\nyour kids, but from what you say I get the impression that it&#39;s one of<br/>\ntotal *independence* (read distance) from each other.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this might fit Joyce&#39;s point that we may treat our children<br/>\ndifferently because we have different *goals*.  The goal of early<br/>\nindependence is such a strong current in American culture that we may<br/>\nnot even realize that it is there.  I appreciate your posts because I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s really worthwhile to think about the cultural messages that<br/>\nwe get that really discourage nurturing.  I think the goal of sweetly<br/>\nloving our children and the goal of making them independent at early or<br/>\n&quot;appropriate&quot; ages certainly can conflict with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  And the economic goal of full employment for adults, that leads us<br/>\nto require young adults to stay in school longer and longer, that goal<br/>\nconflicts with the goal of early independence.  If I were a teen, it<br/>\nwould make me crazy angry, I think.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1123183,"authorName":"dacunefare@aol.com","from":"dacunefare@...","profile":"undermom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: independence/mothering","postDate":"1042179055","msgId":54164,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1Mi4xYTFkNjA4Yi4yYjRmYmRlZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":54199,"prevInTime":54163,"nextInTime":54165,"topicId":54164,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**I personally believe that this culture puts too much stress on kids becoming independent.
