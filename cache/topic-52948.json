It&#39;s from Benjamin Franklin&#39;s Biography:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My list of virtues contained at first but twelve; but<br/>\na Quaker friend having kindly informed me that I was<br/>\ngenerally thought proud, that my pride showed itself<br/>\nfrequently in conversation, that I was not content<br/>\nwith being in the right when discussing any point, but<br/>\nwas overbearing and rather insolent, of which he<br/>\nconvinced me by mentioning several instances, I<br/>\ndetermined to endeavor to cure myself, if I could, of<br/>\nthis vice or folly among the rest; and I added<br/>\nhumility to my list, giving extensive meaning to the<br/>\nword.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot boast of much success in acquiring the<br/>\nreality of this virtue, but I had a good deal with<br/>\nregard to the appearance of it.  I made it a rule to<br/>\nforbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments of<br/>\nothers and all positive assertion of my own.  I even<br/>\nforbid myself, agreeably to the old laws of our Junto,<br/>\nthe use of every word or expression in the language<br/>\nthat imported a fixed opinion; such as certainly,<br/>\nundoubtedly, etc., and I adopted instead of them, I<br/>\nconceive, I comprehend, or I imagine, a thing to be so<br/>\nor so; or it so appears to me at present.  When<br/>\nanother asserted something that I thought an error, I<br/>\ndenied myself the pleasure of contradicting him<br/>\nabruptly and of showing immediately some absurdity in<br/>\nhis proposition; and in answering I began by observing<br/>\nthat in certain cases or cercumstances his opinion<br/>\nwould be right, but in the present case there appeared<br/>\nor seemed to me some difference, etc.  I soon found<br/>\nthe advantage of this change in my manners; the<br/>\nconversations I engaged in went on more pleasantly. <br/>\nThe modest way in which I proposed my opinions<br/>\nprocured them a readier reception and less<br/>\ncontradiction; I had less mortification when I was<br/>\nfound to be in the wrong; and I more easily prevailed<br/>\nwith others to give up their mistakes and join with me<br/>\nwhen I happened to be in the right.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this mode, which I at first put on with some<br/>\nviolence to natural inclination, became at length easy<br/>\nand so habitual to me that perhaps for the last fifty<br/>\nyears no one has ever heard a dogmatical expression<br/>\nescape me.  And to this habit (after my character of<br/>\nintegrity) I think it principally owing that I had<br/>\nearly so much weight with my fellow citizens when I<br/>\nproposed new institutions or alterations in the old;<br/>\nand so much influence in public councils when I became<br/>\na member; for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent,<br/>\nsubject to much hesitation in my choice of words,<br/>\nhardly correct in language, and yet I generally<br/>\ncarried my point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn reality there is, perhaps, no one of our natural<br/>\npassions so hard to subdue as pride.  Disguise it,<br/>\nstruggle with it, stifle it, mortify it as much as one<br/>\npleases, it is still alive and will every now and then<br/>\npeep out and show itself; you will see it, perhaps,<br/>\noften in this history.  For even if I could conceive<br/>\nthat I had completely overcome it, I should probably<br/>\nbe proud of my humility.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Lotus Therapeutics -<br/>\nAyurveda, Homeopathy, Yoga & Therapeutic Massage<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com\">http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDhyanyoga Center of NC -<br/>\nMeditation - Kundalini Maha Yoga<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dyc-nc.org\">http://www.dyc-nc.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\nWhen nothing is done, nothing is left undone.

As far as searching archives.  ( you may already <br/>\nknow this, so dont think I think your inept.. lol... its something I didnt <br/>\nknow til I accidentally figured it out.. which is how I learned most about <br/>\nyahoogroups..) Anyway.. when searching archives.. if you put the word, <br/>\nphrase, whatever, you are looking for in the search box... you will get a <br/>\npage of returns.. ( or maybe not. .maybe it says &quot;no posts met your <br/>\ncriteria.. blah blah blah)  BUT, that is only a search part of the messages!  <br/>\nYou  have to hit next or previous to get the next set of returns.   It <br/>\ndepends on where you are in the archives when you start your search whether <br/>\nto hit next or prev.  If you are at the most recent messages ( last) and you <br/>\nstart your search, then keep hitting prev til you find what your looking <br/>\nfor.. If you go to the beginning ( first ) of the archives, then continue <br/>\nhitting &quot;next&quot; til you find what you need.  I&#39;ve been involved with Yahoo <br/>\ngroups for a few years.. Owned and moderated a few.. so,  if I can help, <br/>\nplease let me know.. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] This list, using YahooGroups","postDate":"1041701316","msgId":53063,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMTA0MTcyODM2LjgwNDE5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PHAwNTAwMTk4Y2JhM2MxYTE0MDEyOUBbMjA4LjI2LjIyNy4yMDVdPg=="},"prevInTopic":53062,"nextInTopic":53065,"prevInTime":53062,"nextInTime":53064,"topicId":52948,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I totally agree Helen,   do you know how long it took me to try and find the no mail option when I went on vacation?
