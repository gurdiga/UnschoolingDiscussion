Currently I am in the US near<br/>\nSeattle on a project with my company.  I was reading through your Website<br/>\nand found it interesting.  I have 2 children and my wife and I are home<br/>\nschooling them right now.   I also work with a group in India on alternative<br/>\neducation.  I wanted to share my thoughts on education as I felt.  Here<br/>\ngoes....<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking at education where the children discover, innovate and learn<br/>\nabout things which are existing and new. Learning is not something which we<br/>\nessentially read and know it is more an experience.  There are no teachers<br/>\nhere and we can only be facilitators in the learning process.  Children<br/>\nlearn in their own way in their own speed in their own style.  We only<br/>\nobserve and facilitate them.  What then happens is they start discovering<br/>\nthemselves, their self.  They learn to be with themselves.  We also learn in<br/>\nthe process, learn to wonder at everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nEducation is something which helps a child flower into a beautiful human<br/>\nbeing.  It does not stereotype and create them into doctors, engineers,<br/>\nscientists, businessmen, carpenters etc.  These are only vocations which are<br/>\nexternal and they could become one or all of them in different times in<br/>\ntheir life.  But essentially they remain humans rather silent powerful human<br/>\nbeings. <br/>\n<br/>\nEducation is also about excellence.  Excellence for me is to do whatever you<br/>\nare doing with 100% being in it.  It can be anything from eating, talking to<br/>\nsomeone, running, walking.... to operating (doctor), carpentering etc.<br/>\nBeing in the present and totally in the present in whatever we are doing is<br/>\nexcellence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks and Regards<br/>\n<br/>\nSatish<br/>\n<br/>\n Unschooling-dotcom Moderator &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\nWelcome to the Unschooling.com Email Group,<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease take a few minutes to go over the following message:<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what<br/>\nthey need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent<br/>\nis a facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with<br/>\ncuriosity and enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what,<br/>\nwhen, where and how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to<br/>\nSpongebob Squarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to<br/>\nfind out more about how video games and life in general are filled with<br/>\nlearning, come join us!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling is<br/>\n*not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed<br/>\nlearning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest in<br/>\nunschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in<br/>\nmind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways<br/>\ndesigned to help each other become unschoolers or become better at<br/>\nunschooling.
