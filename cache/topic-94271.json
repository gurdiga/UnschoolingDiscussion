Most <br/>\nnovels, especially first-time novels either don&#39;t sell, or don&#39;t sell <br/>\nwell enough to pay the rent. Even most well-established novelists <br/>\nstarted out through their first few books working at other jobs <br/>\n(Stephen King was working at a laundromat, for instance). Actually <br/>\nKing&#39;s book &quot;On Writing&quot; is a really fascinating look at the craft of <br/>\nwriting and the kind of life one has as an emerging writer. He wrote <br/>\nprolifically as a child, too (and accumulated a stack of rejection <br/>\nslips, another thing that one has to get used to as a writer).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a novelist, working on my second novel. Even though I have a very <br/>\ngood agent, it&#39;s still a very tough row to hoe getting published <br/>\nthese days. 80% of first-time novels don&#39;t break even. Publishing <br/>\nhouses are being consolidated and taking less chances on new fiction <br/>\n(you&#39;d be way better off writing &quot;The Low Carb Diet for your Pet&quot; of <br/>\ncourse, non-fiction is selling like hotcakes). This can be gloomy, <br/>\nbut is also part of the reality of writing. You have to love it and <br/>\ndo it for love to do it at all. Fame and fortune are possible, but <br/>\nnot likely outcomes of writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe might look for a local writer&#39;s group. Ours sponsors lectures, <br/>\nreading, signings, conferences, how-to sessions, and critique groups. <br/>\nAll of these things can be great for someone entering the world of <br/>\nwriting. The writer&#39;s critique group I go to has been a wonderful <br/>\nsupport and has really increased the quality of my writing. My son <br/>\nstarted a kid&#39;s writer&#39;s group in our local homeschooling group, and <br/>\nthat&#39;s a great way to get together with other kids who have the <br/>\nwriting bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160951630,"authorName":"pmteet","from":"&quot;pmteet&quot; &lt;pmteet@...&gt;","profile":"pmteet","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingHighlights] writing/ thanks","postDate":"1085086207","msgId":94360,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM4ajVsditnMjFlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg1LmM1OGM5MTMuMmRkZTVlM2NAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":94342,"nextInTopic":94417,"prevInTime":94359,"nextInTime":94361,"topicId":94271,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===The what do you want to be? questions are not as nurturing as the what do you want to do? questions.==== See even as a child I would rather be asked","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1174117216\">===The &quot;what do you want to be?&quot; questions are not as nurturing as <br/>\nthe &quot;what do<br/>\nyou want to do?&quot; questions.====<br/>\n<br/>\nSee even as a child I would rather be asked what I want to be rather <br/>\nthan what I want to do.
