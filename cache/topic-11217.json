We have been <br/>\nraising tadpoles since mid June.  They are now out in the back yard in a <br/>\nplastic  baby pool, and are beginning to grow their back legs!  From this, we <br/>\nexpanded our learning to include fish, so we bought a 10 gal aquarium, and <br/>\nhave gradually added 10 fish.  My oldest (almost 6yo) helps to feed the fish, <br/>\nand likes to help me clean the tank.  In addition to that we have a dog, and <br/>\nmy son takes her out to &quot;use the potty&quot;, and sometimes feeds her, too.    We <br/>\nhave not done a lot of research, but we did get some books on frogs, and <br/>\nlooked up info on frogs on the web.   I have taken him and his bro. to 2 <br/>\ndifferent pet stores to see different fish, and they have seen me show how to <br/>\ntreat water to remove chlorine, boil rocks before adding them to the tank, <br/>\netc...  I have also made it a point to tell the kids the breed names of our <br/>\nfish, so they can begin to learn them.   In addition, we have a goldfish pond <br/>\nout back, and we also made it a point to watch birds and butterflies over <br/>\nthis summer, and looked up varieties of both on the web.  That&#39;s as much as <br/>\nwe have done with animals so far.  I would love to raise rabbits one day-- <br/>\ngot to convince dh to go along with it though!  :)  ~Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Brown","from":"Brown &lt;mjcmbrwn@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"VM4Mcb0c00a7SAWYy5690q7D-kkg53teO6ViyfGvd6Ev7M2EYP1nt0OPJYVFsIl5nSC7WGna4DwPAqkAW5oJItOQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Keeping Animals","postDate":"963864876","msgId":11254,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5NzM2OTJCLkU3RjdCRTY0QGlodWcuY28ubno+","referencesHeader":"PDguN2Q4OWJhMi4yNmE0NjUwNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11225,"nextInTopic":11265,"prevInTime":11253,"nextInTime":11255,"topicId":11217,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have 4 boys and we have had various pets at various times.

I have to say that<br/>\nthey have all responded differently to their responsibilities. They generally<br/>\nstart off enthusiastic, but then get sick of the concept.

The dog is new, and so far well looked after. The cat was looked after very<br/>\nwell in her later years by my youngest, but earlier, I had to be constantly<br/>\nnagging my eldest to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe aware of your child&#39;s ways: my #2 couldn&#39;t clean out the rabbit hutch without<br/>\nvommiting!

I help the kids when they aren&#39;t<br/>\ncoping, because the animal must be cared for or it dies. I think that if you make<br/>\nthat decision to have pets, life will be a lot easier if you accept beforehand<br/>\nthat the pet is your responsibility, even if you delegate that responsibility<br/>\nmost of the time.

Also to develop a sense of<br/>\nresponsibility.  However, any pet should be the ultimate responsibility<br/>\nof the adult in the family.  Pets are more then just an interesting<br/>\nexperiment.  You have chosen to care for another living being, a child is<br/>\nnot capable of fully comprehending that.  You must consider food costs,<br/>\nvet costs (a possibility even for rabbits), potential damage caused by<br/>\nthe pet and if you are willing to deal with it, and the life span of the<br/>\npet-can you keep them that length of time.  All of this goes along with<br/>\nthe joy of pet ownership.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to the miracle of birth,  unfortunately for pets in the United<br/>\nStates, the &quot;miracle&quot; of  death is far too common.  There are not enough<br/>\nhomes and millions of unwanted pets.  The babies you as an owner find<br/>\nhomes for are statistically very  likely not in a permanent home and you<br/>\ncannot guarantee the new owner will not have babies too.  Euthanasia is<br/>\noften the only &quot;solution&quot; for millions of unwanted pets.  Some shelters<br/>\nalso have small animals such as rabbits, rats and guinea pigs.  Please<br/>\ncheck with your local shelter.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a note of caution about rabbits;  I don&#39;t know if by &quot;in the garden&quot;<br/>\n you meant in a hutch or not.  As a kid we had rabbits who we fenced in a<br/>\nsmall section of our yard.  They dug way underground and came up on the<br/>\nother side of the fence and had a hay day in our garden.

Zak told me last week he would<br/>\n&gt; like to have 2 rabbits <br/>\n&gt; &quot;real ones&quot; he said that we could keep in the<br/>\n&gt; garden.  So we are going to <br/>\n&gt; look at animals today, including rabbits.  Went to<br/>\n&gt; our 2nd hand bookstore and <br/>\n&gt; found books on caring for rabbits, which lots of<br/>\n&gt; pictures in them (sort of DK <br/>\n&gt; type books), which are are going to give him this<br/>\n&gt; morning before our trip.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sort of nervous about the whole rabbit thing as<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to end up <br/>\n&gt; being the one who looks after them the majority of<br/>\n&gt; the time.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When getting animals in the past has been something<br/>\n&gt; your kids request how <br/>\n&gt; have you handled them taking the responsibility? <br/>\n&gt; What kind of research to <br/>\n&gt; they (the kids) do before having and animal?  Some<br/>\n&gt; feedback would be helpful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dawn F<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
