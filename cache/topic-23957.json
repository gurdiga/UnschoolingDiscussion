If it&#39;s any consolation, most of <br/>\nthe guys that work for us are college grads.  We had an especially good crew <br/>\na few years ago from Bates College.  One was working for us part time to <br/>\nsupplement his real job in a homeless shelter (a philosophy major).  One of <br/>\nour new guys is a recent Cornell graduate, one has  a journalism degree, one <br/>\nhas a degree in something related to the physics of water, but I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nwhat that is.   These guys comes and go and the thing they seem to have in <br/>\ncommon is a state of flux plus strong interests that they are pursuing <br/>\nindependent of the education they have.  One musician who worked for us is <br/>\ntouring the US now with a 10 piece mambo-samba-tango type Latin band.  Doing <br/>\nblue collar work  paid for his expenses while they got the band together and <br/>\nstarted getting regular bookings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my point is that your son will be ok.  These young men are full of <br/>\nenergy and life and will work it out.  (Though I know your angst.

I know<br/>\n&gt; he likes music more than doing dry wall we have talked about that in the<br/>\n&gt; past. I am worried he will give up his music and be a dry waller just<br/>\n&gt; because he is afraid to go to school!

Certainly enough to support a loved amateur<br/>\ncareer in music if it didn&#39;t pay for itself. He may much prefer to sweat<br/>\nduring the day and play for fun at night rather than do some bread-earning<br/>\nthing with music during the day and do the good parts of music at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve loved books since I read &quot;Are You My Mother&quot; in first grade, but I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t find a good and fun way to make a career of them until three years<br/>\nago. I&#39;ll be 35 in a few days. I love to write more than anything, but at<br/>\nthis time I don&#39;t want to study it, or try to earn my money from it. I may<br/>\nchange my mind.
