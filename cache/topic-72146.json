How cool to actually experience the processing,<br/>\nand hear Jaiden&#39;s reasoning.<br/>\n<br/>\n...now you reminded me of an &quot;A ha!&quot; moment I had, right before pulling my <br/>\nyoungest out of ps kindergarten.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI went into school to pick him up at lunch time.  The teacher was walking the<br/>\nclass down the hall...and hollered to me to stay until everyone was picked up,<br/>\nbecause she had something important to talk to me about.  She was very<br/>\nserious.  Once everyone had left, my son sat on the bench looking truly worried<br/>\nat what she was about to tell me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe informed me that math must just not be his thing.  She and her assistant<br/>\nhad been trying to get a simple concept across to him, and he just wasn&#39;t getting <br/>\nit.  She said she had asked him to count backward from 5.  He would look at her <br/>\na little confused, not say anything, and then start with &quot;100...&quot;  She would stop <br/>\nand tell him, &quot;NO...you have to start with 5&quot;....and he would say he didn&#39;t know  <br/>\nhow to do it.  This process was repeated several times before it was time to go...<br/>\nand she said he only actually got it after the assistant did it FOR him.  (No one had<br/>\nprovided him with any demonstration of what they wanted, and they had<br/>\nnot counted backward in class before).<br/>\n<br/>\nI told her I didn&#39;t know what the problem was, because he counts backward all<br/>\nthe time at home,  blasting off rocket ships, running races, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got home, I asked him at dinner if he could count backward from 5.<br/>\nHe said...(very emphatically) &quot;I KNOW how to do it NOW, Miss Anna showed <br/>\nme....5 4 3 2 1.....but that doesn&#39;t make any sense!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked him, &quot;What does make sense?&quot;  And he said &quot;100....&quot;  and I interrupted,<br/>\njust like his teacher, to tell him that he had forgotten to start with 5.  He was so angry,<br/>\nhe just did one of those growly things and left the room.  I went and apologized, and<br/>\nsaid, &quot;O.K.  tell me the rest.&quot;  He said, &quot;MOM....I have been trying to tell you people<br/>\nall day!!!  100....paused, waiting for me to stop him, then VERY slowly....95....90....85....<br/>\n80....75....&quot;  all the way down to zero.  I wanted to cry.  I felt so bad for not listening to <br/>\nhim the first time. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course this made complete sense, because for the past month in school, they <br/>\nhad been counting by 5&#39;s every day.  So when she asked him to count backward from 5....<br/>\nwell, you get the picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I explained to his teacher what had happened........she told me this clearly <br/>\nindicated that we have an attention problem on our hands, that he wasn&#39;t listening<br/>\ncarefully to instructions.  She spared not even one moment to consider the thought<br/>\nprocess that was required for him to have come up with the answer he did.  It didn&#39;t<br/>\nmatter, it wasn&#39;t the pre-determined answer, it didn&#39;t fit anywhere on her chart.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still conditioning myself to take lots of &quot;deep breaths,&quot; because when I STOP<br/>\ntalking, that is when he usually starts discovering and processing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI watched him yesterday staring out the windows in his bedroom.  I thought he <br/>\nwas enjoying the woods, or watching a squirrel.  A little later he came out to me and <br/>\nsaid, &quot;hey...did you know that 24 has 8 threes in it...did you know that 24 has 4 sixes in it...<br/>\ndid you know that 24 has 2 twelves in it.......   He brought me into his room and pointed out <br/>\nthe windows.  Actually, he was pointing AT the windows.  He had been studying the panes, <br/>\nand grouping them into equal sets.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were at dinner with my in-laws last weekend, and he said...&quot;Did you ever notice that with <br/>\nodd numbers, there is a middle one?&quot;  My mil gave him, and then me, an odd look.  He pointed <br/>\nto his middle finger, and said...look 2 on this side, 2 on this side, and one in the middle.  Then <br/>\nhe did it with three, and then told me to hold up my hands so he could show 7 and 9.  My mil <br/>\nlater told me that she was just surprised that he even knew what an odd number was.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can only imagine what keeping him in a &quot;school&quot; atmosphere would have done to him.  By the<br/>\nend of kindergarten he would have been convinced that math was not his thing.  And maybe it<br/>\nwon&#39;t be later...but, goodness, don&#39;t squelch it now!!  Maybe the teacher was right, &quot;school&quot; math<br/>\nwasn&#39;t his thing.  Not enough windows?<br/>\n<br/>\nStacey<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: phred <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, June 04, 2003 12:51 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] kids and workbooks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just wanted to share this, please excuse the length<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yesterday Jaiden was playing with some pre-school workbooks that my <br/>\n  mom had gotten for him. We were sitting on the couch and he was <br/>\n  having me read the directions of the pages he couldn&#39;t figure out on <br/>\n  his own. We came to a page that had three sections with three <br/>\n  unrealated objects, you were supossed to figure out wich two were the <br/>\n  same color and then color them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jaiden was kinda stuck on one that had a piece of fruit(looked like a <br/>\n  plum to me), a bunch of grapes, and a duck. I asked him if he needed <br/>\n  some help, he then explained to me that he didn&#39;t need help, but that <br/>\n  the workbook people had messed up. There were to many awnsers to that <br/>\n  question.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was stumped, to me the plum and the grapes were the awnser and I <br/>\n  couldn&#39;t figure out for the life of me what he was talking about. <br/>\n  Part of me was getting frusterated with jaiden, but I took a deep <br/>\n  breath and asked him is he would tell me what it was that he was <br/>\n  seeing because I didn&#39;t see what he was seeing. This is what he <br/>\n  explained to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If the fruit was a plum, then it went with the grapes, but what if <br/>\n  they were green grapes, not purple grapes? Then the plum couldn&#39;t go <br/>\n  with the green grapes, and the plum couldn&#39;t go with the duck. So <br/>\n  maybe it wasn&#39;t a plum. Maybe it was a peach or a necterine, and it <br/>\n  was yellow/orange, it didn&#39;t go with the grapes, it would go wiht the <br/>\n  duck. But, we had been looking at ducks a week ago, and he didn&#39;t see <br/>\n  any yellow dunks, the only yellow duck he had seen was his rubber <br/>\n  ducky, and the picture looked like a real duck, not a plastic one. So <br/>\n  he decided that the fruit wasn&#39;t part of the awnser, it was the <br/>\n  grapes and the duck. I was still stumped and asked him if he would <br/>\n  tell me how he figured it out. This is his reasoning. His favorite <br/>\n  grapes are green, but the steam is brown, so the grapes are green and <br/>\n  brown, The ducks we saw at the park had green heads and brown bodys <br/>\n  (mallard ducks, I think) so they both were green and brown.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was speachless. I am so glad I took a deep breath and let him do it <br/>\n  his way. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Rebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

We were sitting on the couch and he was <br/>\nhaving me read the directions of the pages he couldn&#39;t figure out on <br/>\nhis own. We came to a page that had three sections with three <br/>\nunrealated objects, you were supossed to figure out wich two were the <br/>\nsame color and then color them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJaiden was kinda stuck on one that had a piece of fruit(looked like a <br/>\nplum to me), a bunch of grapes, and a duck. I asked him if he needed <br/>\nsome help, he then explained to me that he didn&#39;t need help, but that <br/>\nthe workbook people had messed up. There were to many awnsers to that <br/>\nquestion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was stumped, to me the plum and the grapes were the awnser and I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t figure out for the life of me what he was talking about. <br/>\nPart of me was getting frusterated with jaiden, but I took a deep <br/>\nbreath and asked him is he would tell me what it was that he was <br/>\nseeing because I didn&#39;t see what he was seeing. This is what he <br/>\nexplained to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the fruit was a plum, then it went with the grapes, but what if <br/>\nthey were green grapes, not purple grapes? Then the plum couldn&#39;t go <br/>\nwith the green grapes, and the plum couldn&#39;t go with the duck. So <br/>\nmaybe it wasn&#39;t a plum. Maybe it was a peach or a necterine, and it <br/>\nwas yellow/orange, it didn&#39;t go with the grapes, it would go wiht the <br/>\nduck. But, we had been looking at ducks a week ago, and he didn&#39;t see <br/>\nany yellow dunks, the only yellow duck he had seen was his rubber <br/>\nducky, and the picture looked like a real duck, not a plastic one. So <br/>\nhe decided that the fruit wasn&#39;t part of the awnser, it was the <br/>\ngrapes and the duck. I was still stumped and asked him if he would <br/>\ntell me how he figured it out. This is his reasoning. His favorite <br/>\ngrapes are green, but the steam is brown, so the grapes are green and <br/>\nbrown, The ducks we saw at the park had green heads and brown bodys <br/>\n(mallard ducks, I think) so they both were green and brown.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was speachless. I am so glad I took a deep breath and let him do it <br/>\nhis way. <br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72368,"nextTopicId":72415}}
