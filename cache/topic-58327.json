I couldn&#39;t figure out how <br/>\nto thread that one either, but dh helped me get it.  It came with the <br/>\nbobbin threaded and I am not looking forward to the time when that <br/>\nruns out! lol  I don&#39;t care if the bobbin thread is bright blue, I <br/>\nwill put up with having the underside of the fabric showing blue <br/>\nthread instead of figuring out that bobbin.  It scares me to death <br/>\nfor some reason.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter needs jeans, and she is finding she needs plus sizes <br/>\nright now.  Plus girls sizes aren&#39;t in Wal-mart, and I don&#39;t have any <br/>\nput back from yard saling.  I&#39;m not about to pay 30 or more bucks for <br/>\na brand new pair of jeans from a department store.  So I took her to <br/>\nthe thrift shop and let her pick out bigger sized jeans and I&#39;m <br/>\nhemming them for her.  I had her stand on top of the table and I cut <br/>\noff about where I thought they should be cut off.  No one told me to <br/>\nmeasure an inseam--dh mentioned that to me afterwards. ;)  I hemmed <br/>\nthem, and one leg is a little longer than the other.  And because the <br/>\nthread is bright red on dark denim (to match the thread on the rest <br/>\nof the jeans), the places where I didn&#39;t go straight and have double <br/>\nlayers of thread show a lot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I went to Wal-mart and bought trim for the bottom of them.  I <br/>\nfigure if I let the trim hang a little lower on the side that is <br/>\nhemmed higher, it will make them look about even.  I also let her <br/>\npick out some cool appliques to put on the jeans.  Hopefully I can <br/>\nfigure out that zig-zaggy sewing that the instruction book says you <br/>\nshould use for appliques.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just pray that the blue bobbin thread holds out until I finish <br/>\nthese jeans.  Changing that bobbin thread just might stress me out <br/>\ntoo much! lol  <br/>\n<br/>\nGeez, sewing is just about as scary to me as algebra.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; BTW you can turn those jeans into jean skirts pretty easily.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Still have zippers.
