And I have Piers Anthony&#39;s Incarnations of Immortality and the series with the jockey, the robot woman and the Tourney, if you&#39;ve read it you&#39;ll know what I mean!!  I can&#39;t remember the name and it&#39;s in a box in the garage and I&#39;m not looking for it!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gardening book is an ooooold (1976!!) uk edition of The No-Work Garden Book by Ruth Stout, with UK relevant addition by Richard Clemence.  She used hay and normal vegetable waste for mulch, and it&#39;s a book in LLL-ish style of &#39;this is how I did it and it worked,&#39; rather than this is how it must be done :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of LLL, I&#39;m really fired up by the flyer I got this morning for the LLL European conference to be held in Nottingham this year.  Any Europeans on the list who will be going?  Or non-Europeans either, it sounds like a really good do!!!  Talk about mixing causes, huh?  I&#39;ll get struck off before I get struck on at this rate!!<br/>\n<br/>\nTTFN!<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: David & Debra <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, February 07, 2000 2:57 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 405<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: David & Debra &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:daubes@...\">daubes@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;No Work Garden<br/>\n  maybe &quot;Lasagna Gardening?&quot; - have been using the &#39;method&#39; for a year or <br/>\n  so and it IS easy and very effective, too. It suits our style - not a lot <br/>\n  of work, pretty foolpfoof and LOTS of results<br/>\n<br/>\n  For reading - have a look at Diana&#39; Gabaldon&#39;s series -<br/>\n  Outlander, Voyager, ( forget one title) and Dragonfly in Amber - 3 more <br/>\n  books to come. David got me the Companion to the series for Christmas and <br/>\n  acknowledged with a kiss that he was unlikely to get the chance again <br/>\n  until the book was devoured (hee hee).<br/>\n  Make sure your library has all volumes before starting - or get that <br/>\n  interlibrary loan thing going!  There is a site I like (clevermoms.com) <br/>\n  that has quite a few book discount coupon codes for Borders, B & N and so <br/>\n  on.<br/>\n<br/>\n  David is reading Clive Cussler&#39;s newest novel - says it is almost as good <br/>\n  as the Dirk Pitt ones (new main character) and is on the 3rd Harry Potter <br/>\n  with our daughter Hannah.  14 year old son Davy - who started reading at <br/>\n  8 and a half - is now reading Lord of the Rings series again and <br/>\n  impatiently waiting for another David Eddings (read that ENTIRE series <br/>\n  twice, too).  Recently discovered a novel by David Drake, &quot;Lord of the <br/>\n  Isles&quot; and is scouting today for a prequel or sequel. I read it, too - <br/>\n  very good.  Armus is having us read him fish stuff fish stuff and more <br/>\n  fish stuff as he just started an aquarium.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Debra<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n  Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6242,"nextTopicId":5973}}
