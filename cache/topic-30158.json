The reason I ask<br/>\nis that hubby and I were discussing this and he thinks that one would need<br/>\nto look at other reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, his point being that he is a Brockton, Mass native.  He lived in Mass<br/>\nuntil he was 10 and was a spelling bee winner, etc.  Now, he had a very<br/>\nthick &quot;Boston&quot; accent, baaa (bar), caaa (car), butta (butter), etc.  He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t think the &quot;beDDer&quot; is Boston at all and rather that with a true<br/>\nBoston accent it would be beTTa.   We called his sister to ask her (she has<br/>\na real &quot;problem&quot; &lt;g&gt;  born in Mass and now a NC resident with a southern<br/>\naccent covering up her Boston accent) what she thought and she said the same<br/>\nthing he did.  They don&#39;t &quot;hear&quot; their accents as being other than the<br/>\n&quot;right&quot; way to pronounce the words.  They &quot;hear&quot; the &quot;r&quot; in words like car<br/>\nor bar even if we don&#39;t hear them saying them.  Am I clear as mud as usual??<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had lived in CA for 15 years when I met him and you could tell right off<br/>\nthe top where he was from.  Many years later, folks can still tell and that<br/>\nis after living in CA for over 30 years.  And even with this lingering<br/>\naccent, he is the best speller in this house.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cleopatra@...\">cleopatra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, December 21, 2001 10:10 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Boston accent & reading & spelling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes Yes!!  a little background first...<br/>\n&gt; I taught myself to read at 5.

It was a huge thorn<br/>\n&gt; in my side that she couldn&#39;t read.  I got more and more<br/>\n&gt; frustrated.  Wasted more and more money on stuff like<br/>\n&gt; Hooked on Phonics ,etc.  Finally realized she did not want<br/>\n&gt; to read.  That was even harder to accept. But on her 10th<br/>\n&gt; birthday she decided she did want to read and has been<br/>\n&gt; going strong ever since.  EXCEPT... Here she is reading all<br/>\n&gt; sorts of books and comprehending and writing the best darn<br/>\n&gt; book reports, etc but she has the worst spelling.  I<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t understand how she could read so well and spell so<br/>\n&gt; poorly.  But one day recently I realized we work on her<br/>\n&gt; spelling via phonics and with her accent she simply can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; hear half the vowels.<br/>\n&gt; She was born in Massachusetts, on the South Shore.  Not<br/>\n&gt; only does she not hear vowels in some cases she doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; hear consonants either!  For instance the word -better-.<br/>\n&gt; She honestly hears -beDDer-.  She drops letters at the ends<br/>\n&gt; of words adds some on to others - it&#39;s SOooo frustrating -<br/>\n&gt; for both of us.  To make matters worse by the time she was<br/>\n&gt; 4 she was in a speech therapy class for almost 2 years,<br/>\n&gt; being taught by a woman with an even worse accent than dd<br/>\n&gt; already had!  Now the stuff is ingrained.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What do we do?  Her unbelievably horrid spelling silently<br/>\n&gt; appalls me but recently I realized that it really<br/>\n&gt; embarrasses her.
