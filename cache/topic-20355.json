Our 9yo went to K at public school and I was told he most likely had ADD.  The teacher gave examples of how he just couldn&#39;t settle down and concentrate.  My favorite was that he couldn&#39;t sit down and watch tv like the other children.  One look around the room and I knew he had a bad case of BWTB, bored with teacher&#39;s babble.  The class was packed with all those hands-on things to stimulate little kids into thinking school is a fun place.  He believed them and was out to have FUN.  This tended to distract the other students but he was still learning everything the schoolies wanted him too.  The way I seen it, how could he have an attention problem if he could concentrate on things (just not the teacher or lesson of the moment) and be learning.  The teacher assured me he would have mounting problems later on and I should seek the further advice of our doctor as they have medication to help with this problem.  See Ya. <br/>\n That was it for us.  It&#39;s taken me 4 years to convince him that school isn&#39;t like K with all the fun stuff and games.  Up until last year he still wanted to go back to play with the other kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t it nice to be out of the cave?<br/>\n<br/>\nKandi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104465,"nextTopicId":104559}}
