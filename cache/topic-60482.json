We went to a highly recommended dentist who has privileges at her local hospital to do general anaesthetic work.  <br/>\n <br/>\nNow while I would not want to go to her on a regular basis (too cold and businesslike for me), Michelle likes her (especially the toys they have.) The work is apparently extensive, and the wait is shorter for the hospital in this city as opposed to Children&#39;s Hospital in Vancouver.  I also feel safer than in a clinic, plus the anaethesia is covered under my medical plan. <br/>\n <br/>\nI plan to let her come with me in the future to watch how my appointments go, if she&#39;s willing.  I think I was so afraid of her picking up my fear of dentists, I didn&#39;t take her earlier on.  As it is, she&#39;s picked up on it anyway &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has been receptive to brushing more often - she now has a Scooby-Doo electric toothbrush which she picked out and she lets me do the brushing most of the time.  So she is getting comfortable with more &quot;hands in her mouth&quot; than before.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to laugh (though my first notion was to cry) at something this new dentist said to me, after she examined Michelle, had asked about what grade she was in and Michelle told her she homeschooled.  The dentist then equated tooth decay with homeschooling.  She said that being at home and having access to food whenever she wanted was a cause of her decay.  <br/>\n <br/>\nShe asked me what she drank and looked surprised when I told her Michelle preferred water and milk to anything sweet to drink.  I only thought later that I could have countered with &quot;homeschooled kids have more opportunity to brush their teeth than kids in school, who also eat throughout the day at two recess breaks and lunch with little time for dental hygiene.&quot;  But she had to latch on to some reason why, I guess.  Dentists wouldn&#39;t stay in business long if we didn&#39;t feel guilty for something we&#39;d done or not done.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for all your suggestions and thoughts.  I really appreciated them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This above all, - to thine own self be true;<br/>\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,<br/>\nThou canst not then be false to any man.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHamlet I iii 78, William Shakespeare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60619,"nextTopicId":60641}}
