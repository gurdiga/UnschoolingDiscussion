It took a LONG time to overcome (or undue) what a life in the PS<br/>\ndid to her.  She was a typical girl, I think, but she HATED school.  From as<br/>\nearly as kindergarten, she&#39;d go out the door kicking and screaming.  Every<br/>\nday for her was an ordeal.  She always did well in school, once she got<br/>\nthere, but her last year was a series of stomach aches, migraines, colds,<br/>\nflus, sore throats, and anything else she could manifest to get out of<br/>\ngoing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too fell into the trap of replicating school at home when we first<br/>\nstarted.  (I took my son out of school several months later too).  I did<br/>\nthis for about 6 weeks and saw that I was no better a force-feed teacher<br/>\nthan her public school teachers (surprise, surprise).  So I left them alone.<br/>\nAfter several months, my daughter started watching the news.  Now the news<br/>\nis on her TV all the time as she chats with her world-wide pen pals.  She&#39;s<br/>\nalso taken up instruments, writes stories, and is a fierce debater on any<br/>\ntopic thrown at her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I mentioned in my introduction, I enrolled them in the Chicago Sudbury<br/>\nSchool at the end of last year.  They&#39;ll be starting there again in late<br/>\nAugust.  The best thing about Sudbury, for my kids, is it gives them other<br/>\nkids to associate with (all mixed ages).  My daughter has begun watching<br/>\nother news type programs so she&#39;ll be able to participate in the debates she<br/>\nhas with her schoolmates.  Sudbury doesn&#39;t have grades, classes, regular<br/>\nschool hours or even a curriculum, but somehow they manage to conform to the<br/>\nprivate school legal requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are very mixed feelings about HSLDA, but I joined.  As an<br/>\nAtheist, I found it difficult, but I believed that their heart and motives<br/>\nwere in the right place.  I also saw that no other lobbying group had sprung<br/>\nup to help home schoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI lived in NJ and now live in Illinois.  The two best States to live in to<br/>\nhome school.  We considered living in another area once because of the job<br/>\nopportunity but looked at their home school laws and decided against it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not get a NJ address?  Then you&#39;ll be out of the radar of the public<br/>\nschools and will be more able to do what you know to be right for your<br/>\ndaughter.  The other option is to band together with other PA home and<br/>\nunschoolers in your area and get a P.O. box type address for your private,<br/>\nschool without walls.  Appoint one parent as principal, another as teacher,<br/>\nanother as school secretary, etc.  Have a monthly or quarterly meeting<br/>\n(local park sounds like a good place)--take minutes, fill out report cards,<br/>\netc.  If any of your group (or you) are religious, link up with your local<br/>\nchurch and run your private home schools through them.  Separation of church<br/>\nand state laws will stop the meddling immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Freedomfighter68@...\">Freedomfighter68@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Freedomfighter68@...\">Freedomfighter68@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, August 08, 2001 8:08 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling in PA!?!?!?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  California must be a great state to unschool in.
