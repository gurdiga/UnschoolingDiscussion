My family just wasn&#39;t like <br/>\nthat. So I don&#39;t have childhood experience with it... but I do have <br/>\nadult experience with it. And some of the feelings that came up as <br/>\nan adult were so intense and angry that I wondered if it would have <br/>\nbeen even more so for me as a child (because I do remember feeling <br/>\nthings very intensely, in general, as a child.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I felt: my boyfriend at the time would start out by <br/>\ninitiating some playful wrestling, even affectionate. It would <br/>\nalmost always turn into something, though, that wasn&#39;t just about us <br/>\nbeing physical with each other in a positive way. It was subtly <br/>\naggressive and competitive, and well, he was stronger than me. I <br/>\ncannot begin to tell you how filled with rage that our &quot;fighting&quot; <br/>\nwas not equal, that he had the upper hand and I felt weaker. I would <br/>\nreally want to hurt him I would be so angry. But I had the ability <br/>\nto control that impulse -- I can imagine it being harder for some <br/>\npeople to do so, perhaps especially a special needs child for whom <br/>\nit is too much to handle on top of all the other every day <br/>\nfrustrations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree totally with Kathryn, who wrote: &quot;My first suggestion is <br/>\nthat no adult (or bigger kid) should initiate this kind of play in <br/>\nyour house.[...] If Ben initiates a very active game, the adults <br/>\ninvolved should find a way to deflect the game so it&#39;s not a <br/>\nfighting game.

We all slept late.  <br/>\nMorning is always time for cuddling, especially Ben (our &quot;special&quot; <br/>\nkid...pdd-nos). He loves &quot;snuggling&quot;.  I snuggle him to bed, I <br/>\nsnuggle him in the morning when he comes in to our room.  The kids <br/>\nwent down and played with a new playdoh toy, after having breakfast.  <br/>\nAll was well. NOw, I know there are some Feingolders here (we used to <br/>\nbe) I have to say out front, the behavior I am about to mention is <br/>\nsomething that never changed on all the diets we tried.  It is the <br/>\nmost difficult of all his issues and springs out of nowhere.  One <br/>\nnever knows when an &quot;incident&quot; will occur.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Robert (my dh their dad) comes into the living room and starts <br/>\nplay fighting. Everything is fine, Ben is laughing, having a blast <br/>\nbeing launched onto the couch, Autumn, our almost 4 year old joins in <br/>\nthe fun. Ben has SID issues (obvious) and loves proprioceptive input <br/>\n(a crash bang kid).  So he&#39;s throwing punches and stuff.  Then I <br/>\njoin in because Robert is &quot;under attack&quot; and then Ben&#39;s play gets <br/>\nrough, he is out to get &quot;me&quot;.  He loves me more than anyone in the <br/>\nworld. But his anger toward me at the same time is immense. Once he <br/>\nseems to cross a line he really wants to hurt the hell out of me.  I <br/>\nran upstairs and enlisted the help of my 14 year old, Andrew, who is <br/>\nalways happy to kick some butt (g).  Actually, he is a very peaceful <br/>\nkid, but he&#39;s huge 6ft and 180 pounds.  SO he&#39;s a great shield.  Then <br/>\nI ran downstairs and hid in my husband&#39;s office  til Robert and <br/>\nAndrew could grab Ben and protect me from him.  When I thought I was <br/>\nin  the clear, Ben found me and started punching the crap out of me. <br/>\nRobert has him now, and is trying to calm him down. We sometimes call <br/>\nthis &quot;Hulk&quot; behavior, because Ben enjoys rough housing, but sometimes <br/>\nhe can cross the threshold and he is suddenly green with rage and is <br/>\nmy 7 year old Hulk. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious how many of you deal with this <br/>\nstuff, and what you do about it? Ben just came up and told me that he <br/>\ntalked with Dad and what happens is he thinks the fight is real and <br/>\nhe has to really get me. It&#39;s like this is that difficulty with <br/>\npretend play stuff. Robert came up and told me that Ben (at 7) is so <br/>\nworried about stuff WAY in the future. How is going to get a job, <br/>\nwhat if he gets lost on the way there.  How is he going to know what <br/>\ntoys to buy his kids, which toys to give to charity when his kids out <br/>\ngrow them.  Then he told Robert that he (Robert) needs to teach Ben <br/>\nthese things so he can be a grown up.  Robert answered that he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t teach these things to Andrew (14) and that Ben should just <br/>\nenjoy being a kid, but if Ben really wants him to he will. Ugh? You <br/>\nthink you have an idea of what&#39;s floating <br/>\naround in your kid&#39;s head, and you have really have no idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, worst of all, Robert says to me that he thinks we really should <br/>\nconsider special ed school for Ben, even if it is only a few days a <br/>\nweek.  I asked what he thought that could possibly accomplish for <br/>\nBen, other than teach him that when you are full of rage you get sent <br/>\naway from your loving family.  He understood, but he said that his <br/>\nconversation with Ben suggested to him that Ben feels out of control <br/>\nof things because he doesn&#39;t &quot;know&quot; about them. Granted, I have <br/>\nposted here before that Ben says he wants to know how to read, but he <br/>\nisn&#39;t interested in learning how to go about that. What do <br/>\nunschoolers say about a kid that is asking to be able to master a <br/>\nskill and wants your help, but then has no patience for when you try <br/>\nand give the asked for help. Is &quot;teaching&quot; always EVIL, or is it <br/>\nnecessary sometimes?  I really don&#39;t have a clue.  Here I am letting <br/>\nthis kid enjoy his life. I think it&#39;s going great, then he yells at <br/>\nas that we are preparing him for his future. What the hell??? FYI, I <br/>\nhave read the various essays on Sandra&#39;s site regarding special needs <br/>\nkids, and spend some time on the unschooling.com msg boards of the <br/>\nsame topic. For those that don&#39;t have a kid like this, it may be <br/>\ndifficult to understand, that in the back of my mind, I get scared of <br/>\nthe idea that when Ben is 14 and huge, if he gets that mad at me, he <br/>\ncould really hurt me. It scares me for both of us, because he if <br/>\nreally hurt me in a fit of blind rage, his remorse when it was over <br/>\nwould verge on suicide. He has already shown this side of himself at <br/>\n7 1/2.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a child who was nursed til he was 5. Slept with us til he was <br/>\nalmost 6. Has been unschooled, except for a brief 3 days per week for <br/>\n5 weeks stint in special ed class 2 years ago, at 5 (which was a <br/>\nnightmare I don&#39;t wish to repeat, though every one is bearing down on <br/>\nme to reapeat it.) He has been on meds for a year (for anxiety) and <br/>\nprior to that we did every natural diet, remedy, supplements in order <br/>\nto prevent meds. I am a concerned, educated, very in love with my <br/>\nchildren mother, who only wants the best for me kids. My husband, who <br/>\nmay not be on board, totally, with unschooling, has come a long way. <br/>\nMost of all, he loves his kids desperately too. He is so concerned <br/>\nand worried about his Ben. These kind of &quot;incidents&quot; scare the living <br/>\nsh*t out of us. Okay, I&#39;m ready, everyone with <br/>\nan opinion...FIRE AWAY.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel<br/>\n*******************************<br/>\nRachel, I absolutely think you SHOULD be scared, for you and for Ben. If at 7 <br/>\nhe gets so violent that you are in danger of being hurt and need help, you <br/>\nneed to work this out now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Julian was little his dad would play active games with him that would <br/>\nexcite and thrill Julian. At first he&#39;d be having a great time and laughing, but <br/>\nsuddenly he would fall apart and start to cry. Lots of guys do that with <br/>\nchildren, and it&#39;s hard to know when it&#39;s too much and when to stop. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy first suggestion is that no adult (or bigger kid) should initiate this <br/>\nkind of play in your house. Ben can&#39;t control the feelings that come up, and it&#39;s <br/>\nnot fair to him. This is one place where you CAN control the environment so <br/>\nhe isn&#39;t in this position. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf Ben initiates a very active game, the adults involved should find a way to <br/>\ndeflect the game so it&#39;s not a fighting game. It can still be active, but not <br/>\nhave implications that it could be anything real or serious where he could <br/>\nfeel out of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that might help is to have a &quot;safe word.&quot; When Julian was <br/>\nlittle he liked to be tickled, but it was vital that he (or anyone else in the <br/>\nfamily) could feel in control of it. So if someone said &quot;Tipper Gore&quot; it stopped <br/>\nimmediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t going to eliminate his issues of rage and violent reactions, <br/>\nbecause they may still come up in other contexts. But this is not a kid who needs <br/>\nthe pressure of play fighting. He must feel horrible when it happens, and when <br/>\nhe gets bigger it COULD be a real problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSending Ben to school will NOT make it better. It will be more stress. But <br/>\nyou could ask him what he wants to know for when he&#39;s grown up, and tell him <br/>\nyou&#39;ll make sure he knows those things. Ask him if he&#39;d like to learn to cook, or <br/>\ndo laundry, or help you do something for his little sister, so he can learn <br/>\nto be a good dad if he wants someday.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s feeling bad about reading (which sucks, given that he&#39;s only 7!), <br/>\ntell him that different people learn to read in different ways, and that you&#39;ll <br/>\nwork together to find HIS way, so it can be fun. Remind him that learning is <br/>\nsupposed to be fun. We can help brainstorm ideas for learning to read for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching is not bad or good, or even contradictory to unschooling. Julian has <br/>\na teacher for a course he&#39;s taking, and he has a guitar teacher. The <br/>\ndifference is that he chooses what he wants to learn, and chooses to have teachers for <br/>\nthose things. If Ben WANTS you to teach a particular skill, just make sure <br/>\nyou teach him in the way he wants to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, more than anything else, I&#39;d stop the play fighting in the house. <br/>\nAdult-initiated fighting games like that can be scary and feel out-of-control for <br/>\nkids with much calmer natures than Ben, and for Ben it seems really important, <br/>\nhowever much fun it seems at first.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160969203,"authorName":"Wendy Carr","from":"&quot;Wendy Carr&quot; &lt;WendyWCarr@...&gt;","profile":"wendycarrga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] spectrum kids, rage, unschooling (long)","postDate":"1074465638","msgId":89324,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTUtRjI5T205eDRuendqeVgwMDAzMmM1NEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":89321,"nextInTopic":89333,"prevInTime":89323,"nextInTime":89325,"topicId":89308,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-770942610\">&lt; once was sitting around a campfire with some families and the topic<br/>\nturned to brush fires we were experiencing - about a hundred miles away<br/>\nfrom where we were.

Everything is fine, Ben is laughing, having a blast <br/>\nbeing launched onto the couch, Autumn, our almost 4 year old joins in <br/>\nthe fun. Ben has SID issues (obvious) and loves proprioceptive input <br/>\n(a crash bang kid).  So he&#39;s throwing punches and stuff.  Then I <br/>\njoin in because Robert is &quot;under attack&quot; and then Ben&#39;s play gets <br/>\nrough, he is out to get &quot;me&quot;.  He loves me more than anyone in the <br/>\nworld. But his anger toward me at the same time is immense. Once he <br/>\nseems to cross a line he really wants to hurt the hell out of me.  I <br/>\nran upstairs and enlisted the help of my 14 year old, Andrew, who is <br/>\nalways happy to kick some butt (g).  Actually, he is a very peaceful <br/>\nkid, but he&#39;s huge 6ft and 180 pounds.  SO he&#39;s a great shield.  Then <br/>\nI ran downstairs and hid in my husband&#39;s office  til Robert and <br/>\nAndrew could grab Ben and protect me from him.  When I thought I was <br/>\nin  the clear, Ben found me and started punching the crap out of me. <br/>\nRobert has him now, and is trying to calm him down. We sometimes call <br/>\nthis &quot;Hulk&quot; behavior, because Ben enjoys rough housing, but sometimes <br/>\nhe can cross the threshold and he is suddenly green with rage and is <br/>\nmy 7 year old Hulk. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious how many of you deal with this <br/>\nstuff, and what you do about it? Ben just came up and told me that he <br/>\ntalked with Dad and what happens is he thinks the fight is real and <br/>\nhe has to really get me. It&#39;s like this is that difficulty with <br/>\npretend play stuff. Robert came up and told me that Ben (at 7) is so <br/>\nworried about stuff WAY in the future. How is going to get a job, <br/>\nwhat if he gets lost on the way there.  How is he going to know what <br/>\ntoys to buy his kids, which toys to give to charity when his kids out <br/>\ngrow them.  Then he told Robert that he (Robert) needs to teach Ben <br/>\nthese things so he can be a grown up.  Robert answered that he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t teach these things to Andrew (14) and that Ben should just <br/>\nenjoy being a kid, but if Ben really wants him to he will. Ugh? You <br/>\nthink you have an idea of what&#39;s floating <br/>\naround in your kid&#39;s head, and you have really have no idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, worst of all, Robert says to me that he thinks we really should <br/>\nconsider special ed school for Ben, even if it is only a few days a <br/>\nweek.  I asked what he thought that could possibly accomplish for <br/>\nBen, other than teach him that when you are full of rage you get sent <br/>\naway from your loving family.  He understood, but he said that his <br/>\nconversation with Ben suggested to him that Ben feels out of control <br/>\nof things because he doesn&#39;t &quot;know&quot; about them. Granted, I have <br/>\nposted here before that Ben says he wants to know how to read, but he <br/>\nisn&#39;t interested in learning how to go about that. What do <br/>\nunschoolers say about a kid that is asking to be able to master a <br/>\nskill and wants your help, but then has no patience for when you try <br/>\nand give the asked for help. Is &quot;teaching&quot; always EVIL, or is it <br/>\nnecessary sometimes?  I really don&#39;t have a clue.  Here I am letting <br/>\nthis kid enjoy his life. I think it&#39;s going great, then he yells at <br/>\nas that we are preparing him for his future. What the hell??? FYI, I <br/>\nhave read the various essays on Sandra&#39;s site regarding special needs <br/>\nkids, and spend some time on the unschooling.com msg boards of the <br/>\nsame topic. For those that don&#39;t have a kid like this, it may be <br/>\ndifficult to understand, that in the back of my mind, I get scared of <br/>\nthe idea that when Ben is 14 and huge, if he gets that mad at me, he <br/>\ncould really hurt me. It scares me for both of us, because he if <br/>\nreally hurt me in a fit of blind rage, his remorse when it was over <br/>\nwould verge on suicide. He has already shown this side of himself at <br/>\n7 1/2.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a child who was nursed til he was 5. Slept with us til he was <br/>\nalmost 6. Has been unschooled, except for a brief 3 days per week for <br/>\n5 weeks stint in special ed class 2 years ago, at 5 (which was a <br/>\nnightmare I don&#39;t wish to repeat, though every one is bearing down on <br/>\nme to reapeat it.) He has been on meds for a year (for anxiety) and <br/>\nprior to that we did every natural diet, remedy, supplements in order <br/>\nto prevent meds. I am a concerned, educated, very in love with my <br/>\nchildren mother, who only wants the best for me kids. My husband, who <br/>\nmay not be on board, totally, with unschooling, has come a long way. <br/>\nMost of all, he loves his kids desperately too. He is so concerned <br/>\nand worried about his Ben. These kind of &quot;incidents&quot; scare the living <br/>\nsh*t out of us. Okay, I&#39;m ready, everyone with <br/>\nan opinion...FIRE AWAY.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21680,"nextTopicId":89344}}
