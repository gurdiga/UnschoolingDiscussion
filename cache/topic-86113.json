So I thought about our family <br/>\ntrees and it&#39;s true that there are no girls with the mom&#39;s full name, though the <br/>\nmiddle name often is either the mom&#39;s maiden name or a grandmother&#39;s first <br/>\nname, and the first name often belongs to several people already beloved by that <br/>\nfamily, going back many generations.<br/>\n<br/>\n       But my parents always told me I wasn&#39;t named for anyone, that they had <br/>\nbroken from family tradition and given me a name that didn&#39;t refer to anyone <br/>\nelse, a name especially for me. <br/>\n<br/>\n       This notion charmed me and probably influenced the fact that 35 years <br/>\nlater, for our own daughter, we chose a name we just found beautiful and for <br/>\nher alone, not naming her &quot;after&quot; anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n       The funny part is now that she&#39;s become such a theatre buff, she tells <br/>\nvarious stories among her fellow performers about the legacy of where her <br/>\nfirst and middle names came from. The latest -- quite plausible -- version she&#39;s <br/>\nhaving fun with is that her first name came from a famous Broadway <br/>\ncomposer-choreographer, while her middle name was given in honor of the Wizard of Oz <br/>\nmovie. <br/>\n<br/>\n       (I&#39;ve never written my dd&#39;s or ds&#39;s real names on the Internet <br/>\nanywhere -- maybe someone can persuade me this is a foolish precaution even for a <br/>\nworrywart like me? &lt;g&gt;)  JJ</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":86138,"nextTopicId":86217}}
