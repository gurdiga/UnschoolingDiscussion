A friend&#39;s cat scratched her fairly badly <br/>\nin three long lines, on her calf, through her jeans.  She called crying and <br/>\nsaid they were bringing her home, when she had called just shortly before <br/>\nthat all happy and saying she&#39;d be home a few hours later.  But she was calm <br/>\nabout it as soon as the pain quit, and she was attentive about antibiotics <br/>\nand care of cat wounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she was playing with a balloon and somehow got something &quot;big and sharp&quot; <br/>\nin her eye.  She came upstairs to me saying &quot;something really big is in my <br/>\neye and it really hurts.&quot;  She was scared, but cooperative, and at one point <br/>\nasked &quot;Can I rub it, just a little?&quot;  I said sure, because I figured if it <br/>\nwas cutting her she&#39;d stop.  She pulled her own eyelid out, she lay down and <br/>\nlet me pour water on her eye so she could open it and let the water in.  We <br/>\nspent the whole time discussing what it might be (probably something from the <br/>\ncarpet that stuck to the balloon--probably a tiny piece of wood, as we were <br/>\nsplitting kindling by the fireplace last night).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we&#39;ve taught them to calm themselves by breathing since they were <br/>\nbabies, she does it herself matter of factly.  We neither freak out nor say <br/>\n&quot;You&#39;re fine&quot; when they say they&#39;re hurt or scared or whatever.  And the calm <br/>\nand communication have always been a part of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember my own mom would want to totally take over and knock my hand away <br/>\nfrom whatever she was doing, and tell me to be quiet.  If a problem was <br/>\nturned over to her it was HERS and no longer the kid&#39;s.  I would have stopped <br/>\nat any point Holly said stop.  She knows what she can handle and what she <br/>\ncan&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd other kids have been hurt here and not handled themselves or getting <br/>\nassistance NEARLY that well.  A cactus thorn in October was a huge ordeal for <br/>\na visiting little girl.  I sympathized with her for the first fifteen minutes <br/>\nor so of panic and &quot;NO! NO! Don&#39;t touch it!&quot; and then left it to my husband <br/>\nwho had more patience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a ton of faith in my kids&#39; good judgment and self-awareness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28058,"nextTopicId":28072}}
