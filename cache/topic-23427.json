The problem <br/>\nis that he is not terribly fond of being naked. He likes to be all covered <br/>\nup -- shirt and shorts at a minimum. Sometimes he&#39;ll sit on his potty if <br/>\nsomeone else is going to the bathroom, and most of the time if we are out <br/>\nsomeplace and a big person has to use the restroom he will use the toilet <br/>\nwithout any problem. All I&#39;m doing now is asking him throughout the day if <br/>\nhe wants to go potty. The answer is almost invariably &quot;no,&quot; but I just keep <br/>\nasking.
