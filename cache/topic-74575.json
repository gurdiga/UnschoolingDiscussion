There are people who don&#39;t expect cards, so they don&#39;t usually<br/>\nget them from us.  (But they might if I feel like I want to write one!)<br/>\nThere are people who do expect cards, like the grandparents, and so they get<br/>\nthank you cards from us.  I think something so little as cards is worth it<br/>\nto keep the peace in the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone gives a gift in person, then yes, I thank them in person.  But<br/>\n(for an example) I coordinated food for a church baseball game this weekend,<br/>\nand one person in particular took over an area and did a huge amount of<br/>\nwork.  I did thank her in person, but I also sent a card.  She made a huge<br/>\ndifference to me, and I wanted her to know I really did appreciate her hard<br/>\nwork. <br/>\n<br/>\nI remind Tim that it would be nice to send a thank you card to his<br/>\ngrandparents after he receives a gift from them.  (Remember, I live far away<br/>\nfrom them.  I won&#39;t see them next week.)  Sometimes he&#39;s in the mood to<br/>\nwrite a one-sentence note.
