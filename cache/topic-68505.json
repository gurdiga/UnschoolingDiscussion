My husband drew the conclusion that rape of servant<br/>\n&gt; girls/women was an intentional part of the government&#39;s plan of diluting<br/>\n&gt; racial characteristics.  I wonder if other people who saw the movie,<br/>\n&gt; read the book, or know the real history would agree with that inference.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh my, that makes total sense!
