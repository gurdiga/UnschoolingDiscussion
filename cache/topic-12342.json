I recommend it to anyone who is unschooling, thinking about<br/>\nunschooling, unschools but has doubts about their kids not learning<br/>\nanything, READ IT!!!!  I wish that I would have found this book a long time<br/>\nago!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Has anyone else on this list read it?<br/>\n&gt; Kim </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12341,"nextTopicId":12349}}
