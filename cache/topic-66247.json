You really shouldnât miss it. Our<br/>\nlatest new presenters are Zoe Readhead from Summerhill, testing<br/>\ncritics Susan Ohanian, Bill Ayers, and Mike Klonsky. This is in addition<br/>\nto John Gatto, Ron Miller, Pat Montgomery, and many others.<br/>\nThe site at Russell Sage College looks wonderful, with two gyms, a<br/>\nmulti-purpose space, a basic meeting hall in an old church with<br/>\nstained glass windows by Tiffany, a big open central quad, many workshop<br/>\nspaces, etc. Our biggest problem has been raising the funds<br/>\nso that the low income schools from around the world can attend. So far<br/>\nwe have students and teachers from 18 countries coming.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still have good sleeping spaces left at the conference site, Russell<br/>\nSage College, in Troy, NY. The cost is still amazingly low, as little<br/>\nas $15 a day for food $15 a day for sleeping, and $10 for the conference<br/>\nfees. And special group arrangements can be made. But time will<br/>\nrun out for those rates pretty soon, unless you at least contact us and<br/>\nlet us know you are coming. You can do that by replying to this e<br/>\nnewsletter. A deposit holds your place. The IDEC is from July 16-24. All<br/>\nthe info is at www.idec2003.com.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSEND THIS TO SOMEONE ELSE<br/>\nWe now have over 4000 readers, all people who have contacted AERO<br/>\ndirectly!
