The upcoming issue of the New Homeschool Encouragement<br/>\nNewsletter (N-H-E-N) focuses on the recurring question, &quot;How do you <br/>\nhandle<br/>\nthe &#39;hard&#39; subjects, like Algebra, Writing Papers and Advanced <br/>\nSciences?&quot;<br/>\nPlease take a moment and send your best advice. It doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>\nlong,<br/>\njust 3-4 lines will be great!<br/>\nHere&#39;s the link for where people can read more about past issues of<br/>\nN-H-E-N: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org/newhser/default.asp?id=418\">http://www.nhen.org/newhser/default.asp?id=418</a>&gt;<br/>\n*********<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay - this is an unschooling list so I have to admit here that I&#39;m <br/>\nsometimes at a loss as to how to respond to questions like this. The <br/>\nanswer is so &quot;off&quot; from what they think they&#39;re asking, that I&#39;m <br/>\nstymied.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut - it IS a question that gets asked, and we&#39;d like to have some <br/>\nunschooling answers included, so if anybody has anything they&#39;d like to <br/>\nsay, please do so - send it to me or send it to the list, either way I <br/>\nwill make sure it gets to the N-H-E-N editor.
