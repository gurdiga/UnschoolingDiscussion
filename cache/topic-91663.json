Most<br/>\nof the triplet moms in my support group  say they couldn&#39;t IMAGINE<br/>\nhomeschooling their kids - and they only have the 3!  Many have  gone to the<br/>\nends of the earth to have the kids - then they push them off to kindergarten<br/>\nat 5 so they can have 3 hours and 23 minutes &quot;to themselves&quot; and then have<br/>\nthem repeat Kindergarten the next yr bcz the kids can&#39;t keep up or &quot;fit in&quot;<br/>\nat school!  It just kills me.
