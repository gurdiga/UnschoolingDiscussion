I remember going to the unschooling section quite a bit <br/>\nand learning and thinking and coming to unschooling with my family.  <br/>\nIt was quite a struggle and a very exciting journey.<br/>\nI also remember there being a lot of fuss about this and that on the <br/>\nP/CP boards and sometimes on the unschooling boards, and as I recall, <br/>\nI paid very little attention to it.  I wanted to hear about <br/>\nunschooling and what people thought of it.  How they lived it.  Why <br/>\nthey thought something wasn&#39;t unschooling and ways to get to it <br/>\nwithout as much struggle or frustration.  Those were the posts I paid <br/>\nattention to.  The bickering and stuggle between the forceful powers <br/>\nof that board meant absolutley nothing to me.  I couldn&#39;t relate.<br/>\nI figured it was something important for them to stuggle through, but <br/>\nI needed to focus on ME and what I needed for my family.<br/>\nI remember lots of people leaving, complaining about the changes of <br/>\nthe boards(I still had no interest in that).  The unschooling board <br/>\neventually became pretty barren except for a few wonderful people <br/>\nlike Linda Wyatt and others.   <br/>\nI became a part of the P/CP &quot;crew&quot; and had many lively discussions, <br/>\nbut not too many on unschooling.  <br/>\nThe unschooling section would get heated up now and then, and I would <br/>\nhave a boost in my learning.<br/>\nI ALWAYS learned more when the discussion of &#39;what is unschooling and <br/>\ncan it be defined&#39; came up.<br/>\nThe more i participated in, the more I learned.

Here I sit with three <br/>\nlovely <br/>\n&gt;   boys of various ages playing Super Smash Brothers II on Game Cube.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Had a restless night so I logged on and read some posts. Not <br/>\nnearly <br/>\n&gt;   as many as I wanted, but the list has been ever so prolific of <br/>\nlate.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Do you see the irony going here?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;d like to take the liberty to sum it up in how _I_ perceive <br/>\nthis <br/>\n&gt;   whole she-bang. We&#39;re off to rollar skating soon, so I might not <br/>\nadd <br/>\n&gt;   all that I wanted to. And I find it necessary to paraphrase, if I <br/>\n&gt;   don&#39;t say what the original poster intended, its purely by <br/>\nperception.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Somebody posted something.. and in that post they said they <br/>\nrequired <br/>\n&gt;   something of their children. Elissa (the brave one who has <br/>\nalready <br/>\n&gt;   stepped forward on more than one occasion) said, and I paraphrase <br/>\nall <br/>\n&gt;   of this, &#39;you are not an unschooler, you might like the eclectic <br/>\n&gt;   homeschool list&#39;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   When the issue went further, and nobody could find anything in <br/>\nGWS or <br/>\n&gt;   Holt&#39;s work that said anything about not requiring.

It is <br/>\nnetiquette <br/>\n&gt;   not to discuss one list on another, but since there were no clear <br/>\ncut <br/>\n&gt;   statement in a welcome letter, the horse is out of the barn, and <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt;   issue is moot. Maybe it will fire a spark in people here that run <br/>\n&gt;   lists to add a letter to their protocol.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   As the mushroom grows, we begin seeing posts that are <br/>\nsaying &#39;well <br/>\n&gt;   why are you (plural) defending people who require their children <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt;   do math and call themselves unschoolers&#39;. This never happened. Do <br/>\nyou <br/>\n&gt;   see the telephone game being played with all the honest <br/>\nintentions of <br/>\n&gt;   the people doing the communicating?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   In an attempt to put unschooling into a common definition, most <br/>\n&gt;   people here were trying to find what does fall under it. Some <br/>\nwere <br/>\n&gt;   still riled up over the original incident (from either side, if <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt;   shoe fits wear it, if not, don&#39;t buy into it).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Those, like myself, were unaware that a message that we get from <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt;   moderators periodically on the list, were not give when someone <br/>\nnew, <br/>\n&gt;   or renew, signs on. The one that states &#39;Because unschooling <br/>\nmeans <br/>\n&gt;   different things to different people... (could Cindy or Mary <br/>\nplease <br/>\n&gt;   repost that for clarity). So the effort by some to clarify their <br/>\n&gt;   positions became what seems to be a struggle for &#39;right&#39;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Personally, I was mistaken in my communications more than once. I <br/>\nwas <br/>\n&gt;   told I didn&#39;t want people to share their experiences, and I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;   want the word mindful used, and some other comments. Neither was <br/>\n&gt;   true, but I don&#39;t blame the person who misunderstood. I feel it <br/>\nwas <br/>\n&gt;   the way the dynamics of how the conversation was going that it <br/>\nwas <br/>\n&gt;   hard to see through the misagosh.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Some people post in response to a specific issue. And call out <br/>\nthose <br/>\n&gt;   posts. Sometimes by name. Some people talk in theory and <br/>\nphilosophy <br/>\n&gt;   because it is their style.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Tlatter says &#39;unschooling is not doing one subject and then <br/>\ncalling <br/>\n&gt;   yourself an unschooler&#39;, when there was no such specific post to <br/>\nthat <br/>\n&gt;   mentioned. And this is the irony of it all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Frustration flew, as there was no such need to defend something <br/>\nthat <br/>\n&gt;   didn&#39;t happen and then all the going back and forth with the <br/>\noriginal <br/>\n&gt;   incident being totally neglected.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Helen, whom I have respect for in the posts I&#39;ve seen here and on <br/>\n&gt;   some of the homeschooling legal alerts boards, was overwhelmed at <br/>\n&gt;   seeing this going on yet again. I can understand when someone&#39;s <br/>\ntrue <br/>\n&gt;   livlihood is at stake because of this. Personally, I didn&#39;t <br/>\nsubscribe <br/>\n&gt;   to HEM because of something prejudicial that was said from one of <br/>\nher <br/>\n&gt;   columnists, and told her so back in December, in a private note. <br/>\n&gt;   Somehow I didn&#39;t get the feeling that it mattered, just one <br/>\n&gt;   subscription. Apparently it is more than that now, and one of the <br/>\n&gt;   people that I stayed here for is gone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Taking sides? Is that what people see that it looks like?

Here I sit with three lovely <br/>\n  boys of various ages playing Super Smash Brothers II on Game Cube.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Had a restless night so I logged on and read some posts. Not nearly <br/>\n  as many as I wanted, but the list has been ever so prolific of late.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you see the irony going here?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;d like to take the liberty to sum it up in how _I_ perceive this <br/>\n  whole she-bang. We&#39;re off to rollar skating soon, so I might not add <br/>\n  all that I wanted to. And I find it necessary to paraphrase, if I <br/>\n  don&#39;t say what the original poster intended, its purely by perception.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Somebody posted something.. and in that post they said they required <br/>\n  something of their children. Elissa (the brave one who has already <br/>\n  stepped forward on more than one occasion) said, and I paraphrase all <br/>\n  of this, &#39;you are not an unschooler, you might like the eclectic <br/>\n  homeschool list&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When the issue went further, and nobody could find anything in GWS or <br/>\n  Holt&#39;s work that said anything about not requiring. And Elissa said <br/>\n  something on the order &#39;if you require X (x=anything) then you are <br/>\n  not an unschooler, there are other lists to go and find what you <br/>\n  need.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n  This broke off into an larger mushroom because Elissa has stated her <br/>\n  unschooling philosophy included chores. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Then Helen and a few others came along and talked about how <br/>\n  requirements of our children did not mean being outside of the <br/>\n  unschooling scope. As that went on, Elissa said that we need to move <br/>\n  forward and forget it, she apologized already.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bear with me here, its a chronologed perception.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, I see after the fact, the brave Elissa said she did send out <br/>\n  a &#39;call to help&#39; because this list was letting unschooling fall into <br/>\n  a category that wasn&#39;t &#39;real&#39; or &#39;true&#39; unschooling. It is netiquette <br/>\n  not to discuss one list on another, but since there were no clear cut <br/>\n  statement in a welcome letter, the horse is out of the barn, and the <br/>\n  issue is moot. Maybe it will fire a spark in people here that run <br/>\n  lists to add a letter to their protocol.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As the mushroom grows, we begin seeing posts that are saying &#39;well <br/>\n  why are you (plural) defending people who require their children to <br/>\n  do math and call themselves unschoolers&#39;. This never happened. Do you <br/>\n  see the telephone game being played with all the honest intentions of <br/>\n  the people doing the communicating?<br/>\n<br/>\n  In an attempt to put unschooling into a common definition, most <br/>\n  people here were trying to find what does fall under it. Some were <br/>\n  still riled up over the original incident (from either side, if the <br/>\n  shoe fits wear it, if not, don&#39;t buy into it).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Those, like myself, were unaware that a message that we get from the <br/>\n  moderators periodically on the list, were not give when someone new, <br/>\n  or renew, signs on. The one that states &#39;Because unschooling means <br/>\n  different things to different people... (could Cindy or Mary please <br/>\n  repost that for clarity). So the effort by some to clarify their <br/>\n  positions became what seems to be a struggle for &#39;right&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Personally, I was mistaken in my communications more than once. I was <br/>\n  told I didn&#39;t want people to share their experiences, and I didn&#39;t <br/>\n  want the word mindful used, and some other comments. Neither was <br/>\n  true, but I don&#39;t blame the person who misunderstood. I feel it was <br/>\n  the way the dynamics of how the conversation was going that it was <br/>\n  hard to see through the misagosh.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Some people post in response to a specific issue. And call out those <br/>\n  posts. Sometimes by name. Some people talk in theory and philosophy <br/>\n  because it is their style.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tlatter says &#39;unschooling is not doing one subject and then calling <br/>\n  yourself an unschooler&#39;, when there was no such specific post to that <br/>\n  mentioned. And this is the irony of it all.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Frustration flew, as there was no such need to defend something that <br/>\n  didn&#39;t happen and then all the going back and forth with the original <br/>\n  incident being totally neglected.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Helen, whom I have respect for in the posts I&#39;ve seen here and on <br/>\n  some of the homeschooling legal alerts boards, was overwhelmed at <br/>\n  seeing this going on yet again. I can understand when someone&#39;s true <br/>\n  livlihood is at stake because of this. Personally, I didn&#39;t subscribe <br/>\n  to HEM because of something prejudicial that was said from one of her <br/>\n  columnists, and told her so back in December, in a private note. <br/>\n  Somehow I didn&#39;t get the feeling that it mattered, just one <br/>\n  subscription. Apparently it is more than that now, and one of the <br/>\n  people that I stayed here for is gone.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Taking sides? Is that what people see that it looks like? What a <br/>\n  shame.
