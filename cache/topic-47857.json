My husband and I were both spanked growing up and thought it was an option to discipline","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1935141869\">In our family, we spanked off and on until Alex (now 9) was 5 or 6.   My husband and I were both spanked growing up and thought it was an option to discipline children.  Wrong.  When Alex was in kindergarten, (he went for 1 semester), he started having troubles.  They have this colored card system that they use to notify the parents of the number of times a child was in trouble during the day.  They cut construction paper into little squares, of differing colors, to have the kids bring home daily and the parent sign and return to school the next day.  The child would miss recess if the card wasn&#39;t returned no matter the reason.  Green=no problems at all, yellow=1x, orange=x2, blue=x3, and the undesired red card for 4 or more infractions.  He started bringing home those darn red cards with an ugly note written on them about how my child wouldn&#39;t behave in class.  This is before I &#39;discovered&#39; that homeschool/unschool was even a possibility.  We tried our best to work with the school and the teacher (which now I believe she is a total witch and doesn&#39;t like the boy children in her classes because they are too much trouble).  I was called numerous times weekly about his behavior.  We tried talking with him, taking away privileges, and anything else the &#39;regular&#39; parenting books advocate.  Then we resorted to spanking him.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWe finally decided to spank.  He was talked with and told that Daddy would spank him if he brought home red cards anymore.  Before long, he was bringing home those red ones almost daily.  Ugh!  My husband would spank him, talk with him about behavior, and he just kept bringing home those darn red cards.  That is what proved to us that spanking is no deterrent and cannot change behavior.   We all cried a lot during that time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the teacher that pushed us to have him tested for ADHD and to medicate him for her class.  That was the straw that broke this camel&#39;s back!   That is when I started researching ADHD and found homeschooling.  Hallelujah!!  We had another option!  Not one person had mentioned it to me before.  My reading about homeschooling opened our minds and hearts to even more solutions to our parenting issues than any of the other &#39;regular&#39; parenting books had offered.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe remembers the spankings, the constant harrassment from this teacher, and the continual pleadings from us to try harder to behave.  He was only 5.  A boy.  Shouldn&#39;t he behave like a little boy??  We have told him that we continue to learn about the world right along with him and we did the best we knew at the time.  His self esteeem is just now returning and he is so excited about this journey we are on now.  He is surrounded by those who love and care for him and have learned better ways to parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think that there needs to be more information about alternate ways to raise your children from the norm.  I did not go to La Leche League meetings so I missed out on the information they could have provided.  I am a voracious reader and devoured any parenting book I could find..........almost.  I didn&#39;t know to look for _The Continuum Concept_, or _The Natural Parent_, or the unschooling books.  Ignorance is not bliss in this instance.   I am not sure how to &quot;get the word out&quot; to other parents who might not realize there are other options (like we didn&#39;t).  I do know that my friends and family somewhat understand our new philosophy so we are sharing books and advice with them when asked.  It&#39;s the people who don&#39;t know any different and might not have a friend or relative to offer alternative views that worry me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKimber<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1572768,"authorName":"Stephanie Elms","from":"&quot;Stephanie Elms&quot; &lt;stephanie.elms@...&gt;","profile":"elmsfam","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] spanking and then not ever anymore","postDate":"1035515342","msgId":47892,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlENkNGOUNFQTc2ODNDNEQ4RjQxNUEzRjU0RDFDMDY2MDEzREM3QUJAZHN0cDEuZGVsdGFzb2x1dGlvbnMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47857,"nextInTopic":47939,"prevInTime":47891,"nextInTime":47893,"topicId":47857,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
