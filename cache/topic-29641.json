I&#39;ve now read more than one study that shows that<br/>\nby the time one&#39;s in graduate school those who were labeled gifted and those<br/>\nwho were labeled challenged can not be told apart. I believe that all of us<br/>\nare gifted and should be allowed to pursue our gifts without being obliged<br/>\nto spend copious amounts of time working on stuff others, the professionals,<br/>\ndeem to be necessary. When the time is right a child will begin to use the<br/>\ntoilet and the same is true with the alphabet. You can have them drawing<br/>\nletters and repeating letters each day for as long as it takes or you can<br/>\nwait until they naturally come to it and they&#39;ll learn the alphabet and how<br/>\nto use it in an afternoon because it has actually been part of their<br/>\neveryday life experience all along.

Bart has been a life saver for my guy, a cool<br/>\nand clever character who doesn&#39;t fit the mainstream either. I try to watch<br/>\nwith them as much as I can stand and constantly critique the shows to make<br/>\nthem aware of controversial attitudes and behavior. Dylan likes the show<br/>\nTitus and I think it&#39;s horrible so when I hear it come on I&#39;ll often join<br/>\nhim to his dismay. They love Third Rock and the Simpson&#39;s and so do I so<br/>\nI&#39;ll join them for those too and point out the particularly clever parts<br/>\nwhich lead to great discussions about human nature and culture.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Leslie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

When I had my first, 18 years ago, all of my acquaintances were into flash cards and the like, insisting that their children would have a jump on the others if they were reading by 2 etc... I&#39;ve now read more than one study that shows that by the time one&#39;s in graduate school those who were labeled gifted and those who were labeled challenged can not be told apart. I believe that all of us are gifted and should be allowed to pursue our gifts without being obliged to spend copious amounts of time working on stuff others, the professionals, deem to be necessary. When the time is right a child will begin to use the toilet and the same is true with the alphabet. You can have them drawing letters and repeating letters each day for as long as it takes or you can wait until they naturally come to it and they&#39;ll learn the alphabet and how to use it in an afternoon because it has actually been part of their everyday life experience all along. I often wish I&#39;d developed Hooked on Phonics, not to teach kids how to read but to become a multimillionaire feeding on completive and insecure parents ( just kidding about taking advantage of  poor parents who are just trying to do the right thing. What good parent could forgive themselves for not taking the opportunity to &quot;raise their Childs letter grade by one full mark in less than a year&quot;)&lt;bg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  ......In the livingroom is a box with all of these &quot;quiet&quot; toys and these are the<br/>\n  ones they can &quot;play&quot; with when we watch television after dinner.  They&#39;ve<br/>\n  all been pulling them out and playing with them since they were old enough<br/>\n  to pull them across the livingroom floor.....<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have stuff like Lego and sketch books near the TV always hoping for a little creative activity while they&#39;re in front of the tube. Dylan loves shows like Crocodile Hunter and other nature and science stuff but the Simpson&#39;s is their favorite. Bart has been a life saver for my guy, a cool and clever character who doesn&#39;t fit the mainstream either. I try to watch with them as much as I can stand and constantly critique the shows to make them aware of controversial attitudes and behavior. Dylan likes the show Titus and I think it&#39;s horrible so when I hear it come on I&#39;ll often join him to his dismay. They love Third Rock and the Simpson&#39;s and so do I so I&#39;ll join them for those too and point out the particularly clever parts which lead to great discussions about human nature and culture.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Leslie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1694471,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","profile":"anoydami","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Unschooling/late readers, was OK here is my question :0) How do they learn??","postDate":"1007873222","msgId":29721,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZDcwMWMxODA2ZSQ4MDFjOTgwMCQ1MjVkZDFkMUBqaWRhMzU+","referencesHeader":"PDl1dDhjZyttdGpkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDAxZTAxYzE4MDBjJGRlMTNmZmEwJDAzMDBhOGMwQGFsYW4uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":29695,"nextInTopic":29744,"prevInTime":29720,"nextInTime":29722,"topicId":29641,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We are going off in different directions here.

I made no assumptions, I<br/>\nasked the question  because so many folks are talking about their late<br/>\nreaders and I was wondering if it was because for some folks unschooling<br/>\nmeans not doing things that we just kinda found to be &quot;natural.&quot;  I was<br/>\nwondering if sometimes folks don&#39;t start out by wanting to be so hands off<br/>\nthat they go too far in the opposite direction and don&#39;t do any play that<br/>\nmight come under the heading of educational.  That would not appear to be<br/>\nthe case for your children but I am still wondering if it was so for those<br/>\nthat have children that they are now worrying about because they are late<br/>\nreaders.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has happened in this house is that back in the 60s we &quot;acquired&quot; five<br/>\nnieces and nephews.  I didn&#39;t send them to school because I figured their<br/>\nlife was traumatic enough, why subject them to still more trauma.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought a whiteboard/magnetic board on one side, felt board on the other<br/>\nside for the baby (she was two) to play with when we went to the laundry<br/>\nmat.  It is old and decrepid now but all the kidlets have played with it.  I<br/>\nmade felt animals and people and bought magnetic letters and fridge poetry<br/>\nmagnets and fraction burgers and tangegrams and all kinds of magnetic or<br/>\nfelt &quot;stuff.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the livingroom is a box with all of these &quot;quiet&quot; toys and these are the<br/>\nones they can &quot;play&quot; with when we watch television after dinner.  They&#39;ve<br/>\nall been pulling them out and playing with them since they were old enough<br/>\nto pull them across the livingroom floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t mean that this house isn&#39;t filled with &quot;stuff&quot; but simply that<br/>\nthe one room (and only the one room &lt;g&gt;) is semi-organized.  Every single<br/>\nroom has at least one book case with some having as many as 3.  IMHO, one of<br/>\nthe greatest inventions of the 20th century was the over the back of the<br/>\ndoor hanging book shelves &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have lots of musical instruments and have sing alongs almost every<br/>\nnight.  All of the musical instruments are in the diningroom (isn&#39;t that<br/>\nwhat its for &lt;g&gt;) which is connected to our pathetically small kitchen.  So<br/>\nif hubby is cooking dinner, I play the piano and if I am cooking he plays<br/>\nthe guitar and fixing dinner has turned into a singalong hour.  They&#39;ve all<br/>\nbeen singing since they could talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of this was a forced issue, the use of all this was by their<br/>\ninitiation.  And, by request, half the time I would end up on the floor with<br/>\nthem or they would crawl up on the couch with me.  That is except during<br/>\nWheel of Fortune because they have all been playing along with that since it<br/>\ncame on tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;d be singing the Jimminy Cricket song and they would want to know what<br/>\n&quot;e&quot; was and so forth (from singing e-n-c-y-c-l-o-p-e-d-i-a) or Mickey Mouse<br/>\nsongs (what&#39;s an &quot;m&quot;, etc.) and of course the ABC song.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt anyrate, with this type of &quot;play&quot; which they initiated, they all knew<br/>\ntheir alphabet, numbers and could read when they were little guys, with the<br/>\nlatest being five.  And it didn&#39;t have anything to do with trained poodle<br/>\nresponses, they just did it.

What I wrote really does sound bad.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; mean it to offend anyone.  I honestly don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong<br/>\n&gt; with failing tests.  That&#39;s why I wrote that.  Of course, I don&#39;t mean<br/>\n&gt; to assume that all unschoolers will fail standardized tests.  I&#39;m sure<br/>\n&gt; many will do very well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The reason I wrote that is because some of us who choose to go the<br/>\n&gt; unschooling route, have kids who naturally start reading at a later age<br/>\n&gt; than schooled kids.  My boys are a good example.  They are 7 and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; sure it&#39;ll be a few years before they start reading.  My unschooled<br/>\n&gt; friends are all late readers, although there is one who started reading<br/>\n&gt; early at 4 1/2.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was referring to these standardized tests that young kids have to take<br/>\n&gt; in the early grades.  If the test-taker is an unschooler and is a late<br/>\n&gt; reader, s/he probably won&#39;t do very well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That isn&#39;t to say they&#39;re not bright.  They&#39;re just doing other things.<br/>\n&gt; My boys may just barely know their ABC&#39;s and their numbers but they sure<br/>\n&gt; know how to think.  They ask very sophisticated question and have an<br/>\n&gt; extraordinary vocabulary.  Both are very interested in history and the<br/>\n&gt; other day, I spent at least 30 minutes discussing various economic<br/>\n&gt; systems with them (we were in the car).  Leroy just would not stop<br/>\n&gt; asking those questions.  He wants to know everything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that, as unschoolers, we should<br/>\n&gt; not ALWAYS view failing a test as a bad thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mimi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Thursday, December 6, 2001, at 11:06 PM, kayb85 wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now wait a minute.

They require annual testing.  Can you find out how many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; years in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a row your child can fail the test before she&#39;s required to go back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; school?  I think the longer a child has the opportunity to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschool, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; better.  The older s/he is, the better s/he will be able to put up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the bull the state requires without much harm to her psyche.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; personal opinion.  I honestly don&#39;t know how else to advise you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
