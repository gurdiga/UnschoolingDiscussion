I have made it a practice never to lie to my kids, which goes as far as telling them the truth about Santa Claus, etc., from birth.  I have taken, and hidden, the remote previously.  I have unplugged the TV previously.  These things I have had to do in order to make a point that there are things that must be done before the TV goes on (like breakfast, getting dressed, etc. - a few chores don&#39;t hurt, too!).  At one point, we were having trouble with the remotes (yes, plural) being broken continuously, or batteries being removed (which does not make me a happy camper when I have to frantically reprogram the doggone thing FAST for some reason).  Then there are the times when the kids actually lose it for days......which is why we have more than one!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have considered placing the remote off limits for anyone under age 18.....but that would never work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I suppose I understand your point about trust and I never thought about that while writing my post.  Thanks for pointing it out.<br/>\nLaurie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24207,"nextTopicId":24224}}
