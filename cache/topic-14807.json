M. Slater&quot; &lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTwas the month after Christmas, and all through the house<br/>\nNothing would fit me, not even a blouse.<br/>\nThe cookies I&#39;d nibbled, the eggnog I&#39;d taste<br/>\nAt the holiday parties had gone to my waist.<br/>\nWhen I got on the scales there arose such a number!<br/>\nWhen I walked to the store (less a walk than a lumber).<br/>\nI&#39;d remember the marvelous meals I&#39;d prepared;<br/>\nThe gravies and sauces and beef nicely rared,<br/>\nThe wine and the rum balls, the bread and the cheese<br/>\nAnd the way I&#39;d never said, &quot;No thank you, please.&quot;<br/>\nAs I dressed myself in my husband&#39;s old shirt<br/>\nAnd prepared once again to do battle with dirt---<br/>\nI said to myself, as I only can<br/>\n&quot;You can&#39;t spend a winter disguised as a man!&quot;<br/>\nSo--away with the last of the sour cream dip,<br/>\nGet rid of the fruit cake, every cracker and chip<br/>\nEvery last bit of food that I like must be banished<br/>\n&#39;Till all the additional ounces have vanished.<br/>\nI won&#39;t have a cookie--not even a lick.<br/>\nI&#39;ll want only to chew on a long celery stick.<br/>\nI won&#39;t have hot biscuits, or corn bread, or pie,<br/>\nI&#39;ll munch on a carrot and quietly cry.<br/>\nI&#39;m hungry, I&#39;m lonesome, and life is a bore---<br/>\nBut isn&#39;t that what January is for?<br/>\nUnable to giggle, no longer a riot.<br/>\nHappy New Year to all and to all a good diet! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14805,"nextTopicId":14812}}
