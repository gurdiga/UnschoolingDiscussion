I am also just starting and my husband sounds very similar and comes from a large family of public school teachers, including his father.  I just keep putting little quotes and excerpts up on the refridge, table.... where ever I think he might see them.   Like right now , the quote from Linda Dobson is up.  So far he has been pretty receptive, I think it is such a jump for some people tho&#39;,  to me its makes so much sense,  Unschooling that is.  I think if I gently ease him into the thought it will be just fine.. I just have to be patient like she(Linda D.) says,  I think both of you who just introduced yourselves are on the right track.  I love seeing so many people new,  it gives me faith that more and more people will see the logic of our ways!!  <br/>\nI have to say that this is the first fall that I havn&#39;t been a basket case, gee, just happens to be the first fall we&#39;ve unschooled.  Usually the stress of school starting up practically shuts me down,  not this year!  I have fibromyalgia, (can never spell it) and the stress of school really was horrible. When I was young and now as a parent.  Can&#39;t wait for everyone else to go tho&#39; and we can go out and really enjoy our life.  It is so good to be home with my kids! <br/>\nLoving unschooling, especially during fall in northern Minnesota!  <br/>\nKelli<br/>\n <br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robin9700@...\">robin9700@...</a> wrote:In a message dated 9/2/2002 10:59:31 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> writes: <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Welcome Robin, that is SO true.
