Jayn at 4, is already an old hand at playing<br/>\ncomputer games both on disc and on the internet (eg Nick Jr, Barbie.com,<br/>\nPocket Polly). The first time she started being interested in keyboards - we<br/>\ngave her an old one to play with - I was full of delight. The pretend<br/>\ncomputer didn&#39;t last long - the real ones are so much more interesting. I am<br/>\nso impressed with her ability already with clicking the mouse etc. She is<br/>\njust going to grow up enjoying being computer literate with no work on my<br/>\npart.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband built our two desktop computers ( ie his and mine) from scratch,<br/>\npurchasing most of the components at Fry&#39;s Electronics. I guess they cost<br/>\nabout $600, and are fast. Add to that extra software over the years and the<br/>\nodd new motherboard, a hardware firewall, and now wireless technology, the<br/>\ncost goes up - but still less than you might have paid for a new fully built<br/>\none with equal memory and speed. Last week we bought laptops for he and I,<br/>\nso Jayn has pretty much inherited my old computer. I only get on it to look<br/>\nat stuff that is historical - my old &quot;favorites&quot; list eg - or send faxes. I<br/>\nget to haul my laptop to the bedroom and hang out with Jayn while she<br/>\nwatches Swan Lake for the umpteenth time.  It has become not uncommon for<br/>\nall of us to be engaged in electronic stuff at the same time - computers,<br/>\nresearch, writing, games. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nA word about costs - if you use your computer in your money earning - be it<br/>\ngraphics, creating invoices, writing articles, sending invoices (ie<br/>\njobsearch expenses) - don&#39;t forget that it is all deductible to greater or<br/>\nlesser degrees.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I stand at the front door to our apartment and look in to the living<br/>\nroom I see bookshelves lining the walls, the pretty big TV, Jayn&#39;s table<br/>\ncovered with art stuff, my sewing corner, the dining table kicked off on an<br/>\nangle (because we use the dining room part of the L-shape as our office with<br/>\ntwo armoires) and Jayn&#39;s toy &quot;room&quot; which is made from the coat closet and<br/>\nnearby area. Shelves and storage cubes - it is actually under reasonable<br/>\ncontrol considering she has no room of her own to put her stuff in. Books,<br/>\nmagazines, art works in progress. Clutter but not out of control, and I tidy<br/>\nbefore visitors as well as pick up each day. I think it is an enriched<br/>\nenvironment, and indicative of a very creative and active little girl.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYet whenever a parent visits our home for the first time, the invariable<br/>\ninitial comment, made with greater or lesser degrees of sniffing disapproval<br/>\nis &quot;What a lot of toys&quot;. The ones who get invited back are the few who say<br/>\nit with delight.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I can still remember specific incidents from when I was a kid when there<br/>\nwas <br/>\nSO much noise and crying and spanking and fear and resentment, and my mom<br/>\njust <br/>\nSEETHING with self-righteous anger, angry with us for &quot;making her mad.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMe too. One time I was eating spaghetti, and my mother walked past and hit<br/>\nme hard on the back. To this day I don&#39;t know what I did or said to set her<br/>\noff. I wasn&#39;t choking - she was raging about??? All I remember of my<br/>\nchildhood with my mother is an endless round of being hit, and her being<br/>\nsorry later, and I had to be the comforter. Happy times in my childhood are<br/>\nalways connected to other things - sometimes school (especially high<br/>\nschool), holidays with my grandmother, friends. But I have no happy memories<br/>\nof my mother when she was not angry with me. I am so determined that Jayn<br/>\nwill have a different picture of family life.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

It didn&#39;t make me love her more or trust her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love reading the stories here of people who might also have experienced <br/>\ntimes like that and not only never gotten an apology themselves, but been made to <br/>\napologize for the inconvenience to the parent of the parent having to throw a <br/>\nfit.  (Talk about tantrums, my MOM used to have some!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s nice being around people who are working at peaceful lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom died earlier this month, and when being debriefed by friends and <br/>\nrelatives about it, and about how I was doing, I came to see that though things <br/>\nwith my mom were bad for me, the legacy of that is my conscious awareness that <br/>\nthere are better ways, and my interest in helping others see them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone&#39;s life wasn&#39;t very bad, they have less incentive to move away <br/>\nfrom it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I&#39;ve known WAY worse lives than mine was.

The natural human instinct to play the <br/>\ngame to the highest possible level can work in places other than business and <br/>\nvideo games.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"Heidi","from":"&quot;Heidi&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"I did something good last night...","postDate":"1069598099","msgId":85197,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJwcWdpaityc3Q2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":85198,"prevInTime":85196,"nextInTime":85198,"topicId":85197,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"maybe it started out with something a bit less than good, but this debate on spanking (which btw I have not been following: been too busy by a LONG shot)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1801418069\">maybe it started out with something a bit less than good, but this <br/>\ndebate on spanking (which btw I have not been following: been too <br/>\nbusy by a LONG shot) brought it to mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 10 year old, whose passion at this point is computer games, had <br/>\nbeen playing off and on all day long. He had gotten to a higher level <br/>\nthan ever on one pretty cool game called Kid Chameleon...which <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t save. IOW, if he is to get to that level again, he will have <br/>\nto start over at level one (stupid game, in that regard)<br/>\n<br/>\nwell, he&#39;d been playing it for hours, literally. Like, at least three <br/>\nwithout stopping. I had some things I absolutely HAD to do on the <br/>\ncomputer, and it had to be right then, because I am coming down with <br/>\nsomething and had to get to bed. Normally, I let him play however <br/>\nlong, but this time it simply had to be the way it was. I thought it <br/>\nover &quot;If he were an adult, would I ask him to finish up soon?&quot; Yes. I <br/>\nHAD to do computer stuff. (and yes, I do know adults who spend hours <br/>\nat a time on the computer)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...that&#39;s the part that is &quot;a bit less than good&quot;: making him <br/>\nget off when he was obviously very into the game and having a great <br/>\ntime at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe did get off when I insisted, and went into major trauma mode. He <br/>\ncried, he stormed off, he got VERY upset. I finished my computer <br/>\nstuff pretty quick (under 10 min) while he wailed in his room. He <br/>\ncame back upstairs after I was ready for bed, sobbing and crying that <br/>\nhe hadn&#39;t ever gotten to that level before. What I didn&#39;t understand <br/>\nat the time was, he couldn&#39;t start at that level; he has to start the <br/>\ngame over completely.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here is where I did something good. Instead of rolling my <br/>\neyeballs and telling him to calm down, get over it, grow UP...I sat <br/>\ndown with him, put my arm around him as he sobbed, and said &quot;That&#39;s <br/>\npretty frustrating.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yeah...hic...frustrating...hic...It took me CENTURIES to get to that <br/>\nlevel! Sob, cry, wail...not centuries...but YEARSSSSSS!&quot; and so <br/>\nforth. I said to him &quot;You&#39;ve been playing that game today. Nov. 22 is <br/>\nNOT years, it is one day&quot; he stopped crying and looked at me.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Okay, but ALL DAY LOOONNNNNGGGG! sob, cry, wail&quot; and then I asked <br/>\nhim if we had other games that don&#39;t save &quot;ye-heh-hessss&quot; sob, cry, a <br/>\nlittle less wailing. I asked him what games, and he told me a few, <br/>\nand then I remembered a puzzle game I like that doesn&#39;t save, and <br/>\ntold him I knew how he felt, because that game frustrated me, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy this time, he was done crying and started telling me the favorite <br/>\nparts of some of his games (we were lying down in my room, me and all <br/>\nthe kids) and answering questions about the games that I was asking <br/>\nhim. We talked about having a two-hours-at-a-time limit per person... <br/>\nwith each turn at the computer being only two hours, then handing it <br/>\nover for someone else&#39;s two-hour turn. I also asked him if he needed <br/>\nme to help him govern this part of his life,(i.e. restrict his time <br/>\nat the computer) or could he govern himself. He thinks he can govern <br/>\nhimself. <br/>\n<br/>\nWithin less than a half hour after I made him get off the computer, <br/>\nwe were lying in bed together, calmly reading The Hobbit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis could not have happened if I had not been in &quot;Compassion Towards <br/>\nKids&quot; mode, and I do have this list to thank for that. It is <br/>\nimpossible to say how the evening might have been different if I&#39;d <br/>\ngone at the overwhelming emotional response with an emotional <br/>\nresponse of my own...or with a physical response such as &quot;give you <br/>\nsomething to CRY about, kid&quot; and swatting him on the butt. One thing <br/>\nI can say for sure...in former &quot;control-the-kid&quot; mode, we would have <br/>\nhad more crying, longer &quot;recuperation,&quot; and broken fellowship that <br/>\nwould have needed mending.<br/>\n<br/>\nwell, just another little stepping stone in my own journey<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks alla youse. much wisdom to be found, here.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, HeidiC</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85325,"nextTopicId":85343}}
