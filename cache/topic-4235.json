When young","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-531214560\">I read the story and would like to voice a bit of dissent.<br/>\n<br/>\nWork is definitely over-rated.  Work often strangles the values which we purport to hold.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen young Peter wants to quit after being verbally abused by a jerk his father goes on to say<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I knew, though, that if I just let him give up, he&#39;d never learn the importance of following through on<br/>\nthings. So I gave him a long lecture about how hard life is and how people are going to yell at him every day when he has a real<br/>\njob. And I kept asking him if he wanted to go back and try for that radio, until he finally said yes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t strike me as a very satisfactory response.  I personally don&#39;t want my children to settle for jobs where people are going<br/>\nto yell at them everyday. Of course it is possible to badger a kid into doing what you think is right.  He could have just as easily<br/>\nsaid &quot;Well selling stuff door to door is that way, maybe there is an easier way for you to get that clock radio you want.&quot;  I know this<br/>\nlacks that certain work ethic, Calvinistic flavour which seems to appeal so much to many people but really seems more relevant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find the whole exercise a &quot;teaching&quot; sort of enterprise.  The lessons in the whole thing have more to do with being exploited by a<br/>\nnumber of different people.  Those lessons are important and Peter would have learned them, given the chance.  However the work ethic<br/>\npropaganda of the father supplanted these real lessons.  So Peter winds up with getting a cheap radio for which he had to do unnecessary<br/>\nwork for a company that made most of the money, being abused by both a customer and (in my opinion) his father in the process.  In<br/>\naddition he gets the message that one should put up with undeserved s**t instead of changing the situation and meeting one&#39;s needs in a<br/>\nmore satisfactory way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lessons that there are unchangeable crappy things that happen, that there are evil exploitative institutions and employers from whom<br/>\nyou must accept crap, all can be learned if they must be learned at all ....on the job so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I am being simply contrary.  I didn&#39;t like the story.  I think that the virtues of struggling against adversity,<br/>\npersisting in the face of obstacles, and being able to set a goal and achieve it are much better served by other stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nEek. I  just reread the story again and like it less and less. Peter could have bought a better clock radio for 75 cents at a yard<br/>\nsale.  Retch!<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon second reading I think the father is an unmitigated bully who is using his kid for his own vicarious satisfaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot; But perhaps Peter&#39;s greatest reward is the pride he has given his parents, who know that their son can accomplish whatever he sets<br/>\nhis mind to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTherein lies the real confusion.  Peter is doing this to please his parents who don&#39;t really believe that Peter can accomplish whatever<br/>\nhe sets his mind to unless they &quot;teach&quot; or in this case &quot;make&quot; him accomplish it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn you seem right on the mark about many things but I think you should think this one out again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;John O.
