Of course, each of you knows whether or not your child could handle<br/>\nthe graphic scenes of Our Lord being beaten, scourged and crucified....\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYes, Mel is a devout Catholic - (our family is as well) and I was overjoyed<br/>\nto finally see a film with some Catholic overtones.  It has been beautiful<br/>\nto see the coming together of so many religions on a film....in support of<br/>\none another.  I pray that it continues.\r<br/>\nHis daughter is a nun (or close to becoming fully professed) and my little<br/>\nCatie hopes to join the nuns at 18 - this movie seemed to solidify her <br/>\ncalling&quot; to become a sister.  She has said she has wanted to be a nun since<br/>\nshe was 4 years old....so there must be something to her vocation.  This<br/>\nmovie only made that resolve stronger.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSadly, I must admit that I&#39;ve been waiting to hear some of our protestant<br/>\nbrothers and sisters start complaining about the Catholic &quot;overtones&quot;....i.e<br/>\n, the Blessed Mother, the scenes of the crucifixion while flashing back to<br/>\nthe Last Supper (where we believe Jesus instituted the Holy Eucharist)\r<br/>\nI did watch an interview on EWTN with Mr. Gibson and he said that he was<br/>\nclearly trying to show the bloody sacrifice of Christ on the cross while<br/>\nflashing back to the unbloody sacrifice of the altar.  Very moving for me<br/>\npersonally.\r<br/>\nI hate the fact that I feel like I&#39;m waiting for the other shoe to drop<br/>\nregarding other faiths and their interpretation of the film.  Makes me sad<br/>\n-- like why can&#39;t we just all come together on something and not start<br/>\npicking it apart.  Y&#39;know?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor what it&#39;s worth, I wanted to write and share that my 11 year old saw<br/>\nthis movie and helped her in her faith tremendously.  If any of you would<br/>\nlike to get Catie&#39;s direct feedback, she said she&#39;d be happy to write to you<br/>\nwith her &quot;review&quot; so-to-speak. ;-)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPeace be with each of you!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nClaudia\r<br/>\nwww.padrepiohomeschool.com\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYou know well enough that Our Lord does not look so much at the greatness<br/>\nof our actions, nor even at their difficulty, but at the love with which we<br/>\ndo them. \r<br/>\n~ St. Thérèse<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91637,"nextTopicId":91639}}
