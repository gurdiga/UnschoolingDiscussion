When the solar storms were at their worst 11 years ago (they&#39;re on an 11 year cycle, we&#39;re at primo northern lights time again), a friend of mine and I drove far out of town to watch them.  Not only could we see them, but we could hear them, they make a wierd humming, whining sound, kind of like a saw being played.  There are lots of Dene and Innu stories about the lights and their sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAllison<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Tami Labig-Duquette <br/>\n  To: Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, November 06, 2001 9:17 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Aurora<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  We saw them too here in Indiana, very chilly brisk night :) I have only seen <br/>\n  them in Mass. and Conn.
