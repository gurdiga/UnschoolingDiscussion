Unschooling at the finest for<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been watching what isaac does naturally and what he asks and i have<br/>\nbeen amazed to see him ask to do division, cus he neeeded it for a game. we<br/>\nhave had discussions on philosophy and G-d and on the space time continuum.<br/>\nThat is along with checking how rafts float in a pool , how far he can leap<br/>\nand how much of a wave he can make by doing a cannon ball.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I was mind controlled by the school system. I didnt think it was<br/>\nthat bad, but it must have been. i think I am coming out of a fog.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still scared adn unsure. does this feeling ever go away.would i feel<br/>\nbetter if i used a log book so i could see what he is learning. and why the<br/>\nhell do i have to see it to be comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndi...domestic goddess and active volunteer<br/>\n\t  mom to Isaac<br/>\n\t  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tl2b@...\">tl2b@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNever Underestimate the Power of This Woman!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":943,"nextTopicId":1080}}
