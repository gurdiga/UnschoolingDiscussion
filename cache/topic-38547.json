He returned<br/>\nhome from that school (across the alley) after attending about ten sessions<br/>\nand said, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go there any more.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were glad because we were interested in homeschooling and really didn&#39;t<br/>\nthink he was learning there. We told him, &quot;Fine, you can be in charge of<br/>\nyour own education from now on.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe smiled and said, &quot;Good, I&#39;ll do it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, we UNschooled from the start, once he no longer wanted school.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom that day on, he didn&#39;t attend any school, never looked at school books,<br/>\ndid NO school-type lessons, had no curriculum, no school subjects, no tests<br/>\nor grades, and we, his parents, did not &quot;teach&quot; him anything that he didn&#39;t<br/>\nrequest from us. Along with being in charge of his learning, he knew that he<br/>\nwas in charge of his LIFE, meaning that he would make many decisions that<br/>\nwould affect his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe enjoyed reading. I think that was true largely because we read to him<br/>\nfrom early on and he loved the stories in children&#39;s books, and was<br/>\ndelighted to tell us one day that now he knew how to read. He was just 4,<br/>\nand could read amazingly well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith control over his own life, he knew that he was trusted to make good<br/>\njudgments for himself. We strongly believe that he knew that the key to<br/>\nlearning was reading, and he had picked up phonics without instruction.<br/>\nAfter that, his own curiosity led him to everything he found interesting. It<br/>\nalso helped that he learned how to use a library when he was small. He would<br/>\ngo to a library ever week (at least once) and fill his large book bag and<br/>\nbring it home for his reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt age 18, he decided to go to college. He took the SAT and scored higher<br/>\nthan half of the high school valedictorians in the state of CT. He was<br/>\nimmediately accepted to the only college he applied for. He was never off<br/>\nthe dean&#39;s list and just graduated Magna Cum Laude.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat to tell your kids...? Tell them that you know they are intelligent, and<br/>\nthat they can learn and/or do anything they choose. They don&#39;t need to study<br/>\nany school stuff unless they want to. They can simply follow their own<br/>\ncuriosities and they will end up far ahead of their friends in school. Their<br/>\nREAL LIFE CAN NOW BEGIN. Tell them that they own their lives -- nobody else<br/>\ndoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe record of homeschooling is proving it to be a much more broadening<br/>\nmethod of growing than attending school. It also allows a young person to<br/>\nfind out how to become responsible and self-reliant, while schools only<br/>\nteach them to be dependent, to wait for others to tell them what to do, and<br/>\nto follow orders -- for their whole lives. ):O<br/>\n<br/>\nOur son took night adult classes at the high school where he learned<br/>\ncalligraphy, and conversational French. He went to the local craft center<br/>\nfor courses and had jobs at local museums that he liked a lot. He also went<br/>\nto work at fourteen making jewelry, and at sixteen clerking at the video<br/>\nrental store where he became assistant manager in record time. He really<br/>\nliked buying his own clothes, even his own computer with his own earned<br/>\nmoney.<br/>\n<br/>\nTell your kids that they are on their own paths, but that you are (and will<br/>\nalways be) there to help them whenever they ask. You can also help them to<br/>\nfind other people to help if they want that.  Do not try to be their main<br/>\nteacher. That can spoil your relationship with them, and that&#39;s the most<br/>\nimportant thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\nPS  For more hints about unschooling, try our webpage:<br/>\nwww.borntoexplore/unschool and/or  send an email to me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nedvare@...\">nedvare@...</a><br/>\nfor our packet of information.
