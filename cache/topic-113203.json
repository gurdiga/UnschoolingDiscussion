I would like to promote it on AL (and also  <br/>\nUnschooling Discussion--you are moderator of that one as well,  <br/>\nright?).  Is this OK?  Also, if you think it is worthy, I would be  <br/>\nthrilled if you mentioned it on the links section of your website.   <br/>\nThank you for all you have done for unschooling.

Contributions may include favorite games, crafts, activities,  <br/>\nprojects, clubs, as well as reviews of useful books, websites,  <br/>\ncatalogues, toys, and equipment. In addition, members are welcome to  <br/>\nask for information on a particular area of interest--how to best help  <br/>\na child with a passion for building circuit boards, or raising  <br/>\nrabbits, or whatever...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also a place where unschoolers of all ages can &quot;show and tell&quot;  <br/>\ntheir projects and hobbies. Pictures and stories of other people&#39;s  <br/>\ncreations are an incomparable source of inspiration and creative  <br/>\nsynergy. Learning about other people&#39;s interests and accomplishments  <br/>\ncan expand our understanding of what is possible and help take the  <br/>\nfear out of exploring unfamiliar territory.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can also share ways in which we organize (or disorganize) our homes  <br/>\nin order to foster learning and creativity while also facilitating  <br/>\nfamily life. How do we transform our homes to meet the different needs  <br/>\nof all family members?
