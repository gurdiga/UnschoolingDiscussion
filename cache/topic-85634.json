It will program<br/>\nyour phone auto dial to call only your mother-in-law&#39;s number. This virus<br/>\nwill mix antifreeze into your fish tank. It will drink all your beer. It<br/>\nwill leave dirty socks on the coffee table when you are expecting company.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will replace your shampoo with Nair and your Nair with Rogaine, all the<br/>\nwhile dating your spouse behind your back and billing your Visa.
