This is off topic, but I need \nto ask-- a few months ago, there were some people interested in e-pen pals for \ntheir kids.&nbsp; I was recently contacted by a sweet young girl, named Kaitlin, \nwho lives in Canada, and is 14.&nbsp; She expressed interest in writing to my 2 \nnieces that are of similar age, and have many similar hobbies.&nbsp; I \ntold&nbsp;Kaitlin I would let her know if my nieces were interested in writing \nthe next time I heard from her.&nbsp; Well, since then I have changed my e-mail \naddress, and she&nbsp; cannot reach me.&nbsp; So, if anyone on this list is a \nparent of Kaitlin, could you please let her know that my niece, Michelle, would \nlove to write her?&nbsp; Also, please tell Kaitlin my new address:&nbsp; <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:learnforlife@...\">learnforlife@...</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp; \nThanks so much!&nbsp; ~Karen Paulson</em></font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000080 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:earthmagik@...\"\n title=\"earthmagik@...\">Michelle Harper</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:luvthegoats@...\"\n title=\"luvthegoats@...\">luvthegoats@...</a> ;
