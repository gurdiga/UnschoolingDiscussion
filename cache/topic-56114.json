I figured it out, I am shipping my children<br/>\nto your house, maybe I &#39;ll come too, and once we have figured it out we will<br/>\ncome home again and try it out.  How long do you think it will take?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason for the rug for shoes is that we live in North Dakota.   There is<br/>\nsnow here all winter, and the shoes are wet when we come in.  If they place<br/>\nthem on rug, the snow melts there instead of on the linoleum!  Taking your<br/>\nshoes off as you come in the house is definitely a ND custom (at least<br/>\naround here).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am the one who breaks the rule here too, I leave mine on mostly.  It hurts<br/>\nmy leg too much to walk without shoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me learn along with YOU!<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings,<br/>\nerin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Well mine fling theirs in the general direction of the hall closet,<br/>\n&gt; so I&#39;ll bet our front entries look a lot a like! :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am grateful that they are in the general locale so that I can<br/>\n&gt; easily pick them up before visitors arrive and toss them in a bin.

I can maintain tidy and<br/>\n&gt; out of view.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I guess if your kids are tossing their shoes in the direction of<br/>\n&gt; the rug for tha tpurpose, your kids do have the habit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I sometimes will yell from the other room, &quot;Can someone throw<br/>\n&gt; all the shoes in the holder?&quot; And someone often does.
