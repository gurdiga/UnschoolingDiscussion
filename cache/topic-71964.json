Do you only <br/>\nparticipate when <br/>\n&gt; it is a natural participation?  Okay... like my boys wake up <br/>\nsomewhere between <br/>\n&gt; 7-8 am.  They watch TV until they feel like doing something else.  <br/>\nUsually, I <br/>\n&gt; go and exercise or something.  Then they go out and play... come <br/>\nin... grab a <br/>\n&gt; book to look up something that they saw or argued about while they <br/>\nwere <br/>\n&gt; outside (they usually look stuff up to settle things  : )   They <br/>\nplay... they try <br/>\n&gt; to figure stuff out... they eat... sometimes they prepare their own <br/>\nfood... my <br/>\n&gt; 6 yr old does laundry... dusts... vaccuums... he is a worker bee <br/>\nwithout being <br/>\n&gt; asked.  My 8 yr old is not very motivated.  When the little one <br/>\ncleans, the <br/>\n&gt; older one usually reads... like a Magic Tree House Bood or lately, <br/>\nJackie Chan. <br/>\n&gt;  Of course we are interacting daily with the world as we are out <br/>\nand about.  <br/>\n&gt; I went through a &quot;Saxon Math&quot; phase for a short time, but it was <br/>\nSOOOO <br/>\n&gt; unnatural for us.  My little one LOVES workbooks... my older one <br/>\ndoes the math one I <br/>\n&gt; have now without fuss... because I feel that I need to know that he <br/>\nis making <br/>\n&gt; progress so that I can &quot;prove&quot; that he is making progress if asked <br/>\nto.  <br/>\n&gt; Okay... so, my question is this... Is unschooling just really <br/>\nletting the kids do <br/>\n&gt; whatever comes naturally to them in a day?

They had <br/>\nto be there at 7:00 a.m. in uniform with sunscreen already on.   I don&#39;t <br/>\nconsider that natural, but I woke up at 5:50 and took him anyway!  (Half hour <br/>\ndrive.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as we got there, he realized he had forgotten the lunch I made him.  I <br/>\nrealized Tuesday was the day they were going an additional almost-half-mile by <br/>\nbus to a remote site for a rapelling tower and driving-range day, and bomb <br/>\nsquad demo.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of that is natural.<br/>\n<br/>\nSO I got a map and directions, came home, waited a while and at 8:00 woke <br/>\nHolly up to see if she wanted to go with me to see Marty rapel.  She usually gets <br/>\nup at 10:30.  She was pretty agreeable and I told her I&#39;d ask her again in <br/>\nfive or ten minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n3:10, we just got back.  AND we never got to see Marty rapel.  But Holly got <br/>\nto ride in a chase car, siren and lights,chasing two other cars, going <br/>\nthrough/between cones, swerving...  (Marty was getting out of one of the cars when we <br/>\npulled up.)  We saw the bomb squad stuff.  They blew a few things up, way out <br/>\nin the desert there.  We saw lots of other kids rapel.  Saw the kids drill <br/>\nand march and run.   When we left a big ladder truck had just shown up.  I heard <br/>\nthey were going to give the kids a ride and talk about the relationship <br/>\nbetween the fire department and police department.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Marty had remembered his lunch, I would have come home, read this list, <br/>\ndone some laundry...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a good yet totally unexpected and unplanned adventure.  We had put on <br/>\nsunscreen and taken water which was good.  We were out there four hours (not <br/>\ncounting driving  time, and for the former Albuquerque folk, it&#39;s past the city <br/>\nfiring/archery range, west of the volcanos, beyond the airport that&#39;s out <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Is unschooling just really letting the kids do <br/>\nwhatever comes naturally to them in a day?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if no days are that way, there&#39;s a problem, but if ALL days are that <br/>\nway that&#39;s also a problem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBalance.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes there should be something exciting and different to stimulate them <br/>\nand give them access to sights and sounds not available at home.
