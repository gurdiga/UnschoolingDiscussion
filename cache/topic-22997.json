He<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; concerned that they may not allow him to continue with CAP.  I<br/>\n&gt; told<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him they would be crazy not to.  Not to brag, but pleeeeeeaaaaase<br/>\n&gt; let<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me!  He knows all the questions they ask the group regarding what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they were supposed to study and sometimes does not hold up his<br/>\n&gt; hand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for fear of looking like a know-it-all.

We slowly became unschoolers, and when she <br/>\nkept asking my daughter what she was doing as faw as school work, my <br/>\ndaughter told her the truth, and mentioned &quot;unschooling&quot;.  She then <br/>\ntold my daughter &quot;How are you going to get a job someday!&quot;  She came <br/>\nhome and told me and we cracked up!!  Maybe you would just have to <br/>\nknow her friend to see the funny part about this.

Everyone was","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1387082988\">Last month I asked if anyone had any experience with the mandatory <br/>\nreport card check for Pop Warner football.  Here in S. CA they <br/>\nrequire it.  Everyone was surprised that I didn&#39;t have to do report <br/>\ncards or test.  Anyways, they asked for a copy of my r-4 affidavit <br/>\nand a letter stating we don&#39;t do report cards.  I gave them this and <br/>\nthen they came back with a paper they wanted me to sign that was <br/>\nmeant for a principal to sign for a student in &quot;regular school&quot; that <br/>\nstated the student was not earning a 70% in school, but they thought <br/>\nit would be good for the student to participate.  I signed, but noted <br/>\nthat my kids do not get grades and have scored quite high on the Iowa <br/>\nState test. This was taken a couple of years ago through my original <br/>\naffiliatilon with homeschooling.  It sort of ticked me off, but <br/>\nsometimes you just do what you need to do to get what you want from <br/>\nthe system.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 15 year old son told me today that he didn&#39;t want anyone in Civil <br/>\nAir Patrol to know that we don&#39;t do grades and all the jazz.  He is <br/>\nconcerned that they may not allow him to continue with CAP.  I told <br/>\nhim they would be crazy not to.  Not to brag, but pleeeeeeaaaaase let <br/>\nme!  He knows all the questions they ask the group regarding what <br/>\nthey were supposed to study and sometimes does not hold up his hand  <br/>\nfor fear of looking like a know-it-all.  He even knew an answer they <br/>\nasked that wasn&#39;t in their curriculum about Chinese gun powder or <br/>\nexplosives or something like that because he always watches the <br/>\nHistory Channel.  But then again, he has the time.  Most of the kids <br/>\nare in summer school, what a drag for those kids! O.K., I&#39;m through. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldsest daughter is thinking about going back to ps and I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to think of the run-around they are going to give me about that <br/>\nhepatitis shot all the kids are supposed to have.  If she does decide <br/>\nto go back, I&#39;ll just make up a course of study and report cards I <br/>\nguess to shut them up.  I hate to lie, but they don&#39;t make it easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23064,"nextTopicId":23074}}
