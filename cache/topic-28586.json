And then I make up a bunch of these little tiny glass bowls with<br/>\nhomemade dill dip, ranch dressing, peanut butter and peanut butter and honey<br/>\nin them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;ve found that when they have helped fix do the shopping and then<br/>\nhelped fix them they are more inclined to eat them.

To prepare apples or pears for leather making, wash fruit<br/>\nthoroughly, peel and core removing all seeds, puree in a blender or food<br/>\nprocessor until smooth. Mixture should be of pouring consistency. It is<br/>\nimportant to add honey to help keep the leather pliable when dried. If the<br/>\npuree is too thick, add liquid to thin. If too tart, add more honey or sugar<br/>\n(stevia works, also). Heat apple or pear mixture to 190° F to prevent<br/>\noxidization, cool before pouring onto dehydrator trays. Coat trays with a<br/>\nlayer of fruit puree about 1/8 inch thick. Dry at 135° F until leathery (use<br/>\nlowest oven setting and leave door propped open). Be careful there are no<br/>\nmoisture pockets. Roll up fruit leather while warm, wrap in plastic and<br/>\nstore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also made strawberry, watermelon, peach, plum, fig and date fruit<br/>\nleather.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Kolleen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kolleen@...\">Kolleen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: Unschooling.com &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 28, 2001 11:25 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1622<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Elissa writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My two<br/>\n&gt; &gt;year old is down to eating nothing until he gets junk.
