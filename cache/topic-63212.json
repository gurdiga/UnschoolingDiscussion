I don&#39;t read every single thing.  I read what I want.  I delete the rest.  I&#39;m on more than one list too.  And I spend time at Vegsource and Unschooling.com.  It takes me about an hour tops to get through it all, usually less than that.  Most of that time, that hour is divided into 10 minutes segments that I get between kids online.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust this weekend I spent time driving one daughter to the movies, had 2 nights of sleepovers with a total of 5 different kids in my house (besides my own 3), drove my son and his friends 45 minutes to the skatepark, went to the movies with my other daughter and 4 of her friends after they spent time helping me clean my house ( I paid their way into the movies as payment for their help), went out to dinner with my husband, drove to and watched my daughter&#39;s soccer game (while bringing friends along to watch too), played 2 games of chutes and ladders, watched a little tv,  read a WHOLE BOOK about WWI and the definition of a hero, washed a full days worth of dishes,  paid the bills, cleaned my house, AND read and responded to email.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m eating ice cream and writing some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSheesh...did I just post in another email that I thought I wasn&#39;t doing enough? Or that I felt guilty about it?  What on earth was I *thinking*!<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Karen M.
