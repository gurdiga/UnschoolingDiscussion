Kirby understood and agreed. I argued in  <br/>\nKirby&#39;s defense (lamely, it seemed) and they both turned on me and said no, it  was <br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nThis was the deal:<br/>\nEncouraged by two friends who have done it, Kirby wanted to deliver pizzas  <br/>\nfor the next few weeks until he can take a GED, get on at an adult job, and let <br/>\n the released high school kids deliver the pizzas.   Keith said if  Kirby <br/>\nowned his own car that would be one thing but Keith didn&#39;t want any of our  cars <br/>\nused for pizza delivery.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s all.  The big &#39;no.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nJust thought I should share. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso I had already told Kirby that we had a female friend who had been  <br/>\nrobbed several times delivering pizzas, but she was small and female and Kirby&#39;s  <br/>\nfull sized and karate trained, and pizzas aren&#39;t all that expensive and he  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have much money on him anyway.<br/>\n <br/>\nKeith told worse pizza robbery stories, besides risk to cars and wear and  <br/>\ntear.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105492,"nextTopicId":54066}}
