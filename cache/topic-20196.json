We used the <br/>\n5th grade curriculum this year. She likes having the structure to <br/>\nwork with. We abandoned the English component early in the school <br/>\nyear but have kept using the US History and Environmental Science <br/>\nlessons. We read through them to get the info and sometimes she picks <br/>\nan activity to do. She&#39;s also been reading a lot of historical <br/>\nnovels. We&#39;ve gotten good at noticing the difference between accurate <br/>\ninfo and dumb textbook writing. She is of course free to criticize <br/>\nthe text at any time, which can be half the fun sometimes. There&#39;s a <br/>\ngreat book called &quot;Lies My Teacher Told me which explains the <br/>\nproblems with US History textbooks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line for me with curriculum is that my kids asked for it <br/>\nafter spending most of their childhoods unschooling.
