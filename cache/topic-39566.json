But where would I put <br/>\nthem?  lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s started a collection of McFarlane baseball figures (famous <br/>\nplayers).  They&#39;re mostly limited editions, so he&#39;s got a catcher, a <br/>\nbatter, and a pitcher.  We have a homemade Lego table that just happens <br/>\nto have a green felt floor.  As soon as he gets his room cleaned up <br/>\ntoday, we&#39;re digging that out and are going to paint a diamond on it. <br/>\n I&#39;m sure he will spend hours dreaming up baseball scenarios with those <br/>\nthree players, until they come out with a few fielders and shortstop.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe and his father took a baseball trip to St. Louis last year, and I&#39;m <br/>\nplanning one for them on the sly for opening day next year.  He&#39;s been <br/>\nin quite a few major league parks.  Way more than I or his brothers had <br/>\never been to before they were 9.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe just spent about 2 hours in the JC Penney outlet looking for a <br/>\nbaseball (only) blanket/comforter/duvet to go with the Arizona <br/>\nDiamondbacks sheets he found on clearance.  At Wal-Mart after that, he <br/>\nspent 15 minutes talking to the guy with the airbrush t-shirt stand how <br/>\nmuch it would cost to airbrush a giant baseball on a comforter, because <br/>\nwe couldn&#39;t find anything appropriate to fit his bed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHis oldest brother helped him paint real infield lines on the grass in <br/>\nthe front yard, and since I mowed it all off, it&#39;s time to repaint. <br/>\n This time, he says, they won&#39;t forget the batters box!  Our new <br/>\nlanscaping even has a dugout (a bench) along the 3rd base line!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, he doesn&#39;t really *need* another outlet for this <br/>\nbaseball obsession, but I&#39;ll keep the models in mind in case he runs out <br/>\nof ideas!  lol.

Another possibility would be for *you* <br/>\nto take a few lessons with this teacher, not inviting her to listen but <br/>\nscheduling the lesson for when she&#39;ll be around.  Or, she might just not be <br/>\nready for lessons.<br/>\nA young friend of mine was kind of like this.  He was offered lessons and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want them.  Then at one point (age 9) he went along to his sister&#39;s <br/>\nlessons and then came home and played everything she had been taught.  His <br/>\nparents offered again, and he just took off.  After a couple of years, he <br/>\nstarted on violin.  He progressed rapidly and then his teacher said he <br/>\nshould play viola because we needed them in our orchestra.  It took him <br/>\nabout a week to get good enough to join us.  Before that, I used to take <br/>\nhim with me to orchestra rehersals, and he would follow the scores and <br/>\nwatch the conductor.  He was also composing during this time.  I always <br/>\nassumed he would either become a concert pianist, an orchestral violinist, <br/>\na conductor, or a composer.  Then he discovered fiddle music.  At age 15, <br/>\nhe was making good money fiddling and also accompanying fiddlers on the <br/>\nkeyboard.  Now at 18, he&#39;s in a very good fiddle band, touring, making CDs, <br/>\nand making a living.  And he *still* could go back and do any of those <br/>\nother things I mentioned at some point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this to say once again that they&#39;ll do it when they&#39;re ready.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and please remember to highlight and delete everything in the digest <br/>\n*except* what you&#39;re actually replying to.

But perhaps you might consider how<br/>\nmuch you are including in the term &#39;guidance&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of months ago, I showed my son the moves for chess.  He&#39;s learned a<br/>\nlot of theory since then, and I&#39;ve guided his learning by helping him find<br/>\nsome chess books that are at his playing level, and spending time playing<br/>\n&#39;talking-games&#39; with him (where we discuss why we&#39;d make the move we&#39;re<br/>\ngoing to make).  I would also say that I&#39;ve guided his Opa recently in<br/>\nselecting birthday gifts for my son that would be appreciated.  I reminded<br/>\nhim of Tim&#39;s recent interests, told him what book series Tim is currently<br/>\nworking his way through, and advised on what lego sets we already own.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn neither case did I require anything.  I never told Tim that his chess<br/>\ngame would improve greatly if he spent a certain amount of time each day<br/>\nplaying, and it never, ever goes over well with grandparents if I tell them<br/>\nthey need to buy THIS gift.  I guide.  I don&#39;t direct.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, that&#39;s unschooling.  Now, for me, it was easy to get used to not<br/>\nasking that my son do certain things each day.  I just stopped asking and<br/>\nthat was that.  It&#39;s taken longer for me to become accustomed to not<br/>\nthinking in terms of what is educational and what isn&#39;t.  It&#39;s just legos,<br/>\nand if I think about it, I can easily find what&#39;s educational about playing<br/>\nlegos.  But I no longer do, I have become comfortable with everything being<br/>\npart of my son&#39;s education.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 2<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 24 Jul 2002 07:59:00 -0700<br/>\n   From: Jeff & Kate Kerr &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:windystreet@...\">windystreet@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: how to unschool when your child wants to go to school<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been unschoolers for a few years now, it&#39;s a philosophy I have<br/>\nembraced since before I had children and my husband joined me in this<br/>\nattitude with very little persuasion.

He came home one day all excited and informed me that school<br/>\nwas starting soon and didn&#39;t I think it was about time to take him? He was<br/>\nactually shocked when I told him that no, I didn&#39;t think it was time, nor<br/>\ndid<br/>\nI plan on ever taking him. (Needless to say, Jack went to school last year!)<br/>\nHe begged, he pleaded, he told us exactly why he wanted to go to school and<br/>\nDarin and I finally agreed that he would go, so he did. School wasn&#39;t all<br/>\nJack thought it would be, he had to get up early (Jack likes his sleep) he<br/>\nhad to go on days Moly and I were doing things he would rather be doing...<br/>\nBy<br/>\nChristmas time, Jack was beginning to do the *I don&#39;t wanna* thing every<br/>\nmorning. Don&#39;t get me wrong, he loved being in school, he just hated the<br/>\nhours. After a year of it, he was glad to be done. He realizes he plays with<br/>\nhis friends more after school than during school, he doesn&#39;t have to miss<br/>\nout<br/>\non what Moly and I are doing, and he can get those much needed zzz&#39;s that he<br/>\nloves so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t recommend school, but it wasn&#39;t the worst experience of our lives.<br/>\nHe<br/>\ndidn&#39;t come out damaged, he wasn&#39;t labeled... (although I was sure he would<br/>\nbe) I don&#39;t know if he learned anything he wasn&#39;t already learning here at<br/>\nhome but he took from it what it offered and thankfully left the rest. It<br/>\nwasn&#39;t unschooling, but it certainly wasn&#39;t forced either.<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 6<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 24 Jul 2002 12:54:07 EDT<br/>\n   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PSoroosh@...\">PSoroosh@...</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: unschooling theory<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 7/24/2002 6:23:00 AM Pacific Daylight Time,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abtleo@...\">abtleo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s taken longer for me to become accustomed to not<br/>\n&gt; thinking in terms of what is educational and what isn&#39;t.

I took him<br/>\nout of school half way through 1st grade when he was showing signs of<br/>\ndepression. He was unstimulated and frustrated. He has huge frustrations<br/>\nwith reading and writing (we are looking into vision testing)but is<br/>\nconceptually advanced in most areas. The crunch came when the school<br/>\nprincipal refused to accept his giftedness and stated &quot;I will not rearrange<br/>\nMY school for your child&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been feeling our way through homeschooling ever since. I have now<br/>\ncome to the conclusion that I have been trying to &quot;school&quot; too much. I need<br/>\nto find a way to get him excited about learning again. I will go along with<br/>\nany interests he has but he is not very self led. He seems to need quite<br/>\nalot of guidance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure that total &quot;unschooling&quot; is our destination but I know that<br/>\nfinding the right balance for my son (and his siblings) IS my destination. I<br/>\nam also sure that a large degree of unschooling has got to be the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHence my plea to everyone out there! With all your experiences I hoping you<br/>\ncan give me some guidance. I&#39;m someone who likes to see something produced<br/>\non paper (workbooks look great to me although I&#39;ve never considered using a<br/>\ncurriculum - he may as well be in school!!) but I know they are not for him.<br/>\nI want to inspire him again. I can see ways and means of unschooling most<br/>\nsubjects (art, history, science,geography etc)since it seems to me that they<br/>\nare things we talk about and do as a family anyway. You&#39;ve probably guessed<br/>\nmy problem; MATH. I can see introducing concepts while cooking and crafting<br/>\nand in general everyday life but how do you unschool the formulas for<br/>\ncalculating the circumference of a circle, Pythagoras and higher Trig functi<br/>\nons, calculus, physics functions etc? Do I just have to leave this until he<br/>\npicks them up himself - I think I&#39;m scared to do that. He likes math and<br/>\nscience and these higher functions  are going to be important to be able to<br/>\nmanipulate the<br/>\n concepts that he already understands.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate any help. Please be gentle with me, I&#39;m new to this ;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening,<br/>\nLouise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________<br/>\nSupercharge your e-mail with a 25MB Inbox, POP3 Access, No Ads<br/>\nand NoTaglines --&gt; LYCOS MAIL PLUS.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mail.lycos.com/brandPage.shtml?pageId=plus\">http://www.mail.lycos.com/brandPage.shtml?pageId=plus</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 14<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 24 Jul 2002 15:25:40 -0500<br/>\n   From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:llindsey@...\">llindsey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: unschooling theory<br/>\n<br/>\ni will tell him about that.. but the YUCK factor might not be high enuf for<br/>\nhim.. lol..<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Louise Rynkewicz<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, July 24, 2002 2:28 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] unschooling theory<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Linda,<br/>\n  for days when there are no obliging lizards I bet he would enjoy<br/>\nwww.froguts.com where he can do a virtual dissection of a frog.

If he&#39;s really interested in science and math, he&#39;s going<br/>\nto be asking questions about those things.  You can help him go from one<br/>\nquestion to the next and show him how they all connect.

But after<br/>\nresearching on the net and such on her condition(ambloypia), its best to<br/>\ndiagnois in the early years to improve your chances on better eyesight.<br/>\nWasn&#39;t until 6 months ago, that the school caught it, when the pediatrician<br/>\nall these years has said nothing was wrong.<br/>\nHopefully she will do better with mom and learning one on one, then she<br/>\nwould have in school...  I just hope I have the patience I need, she is an<br/>\nextreme hyper child...but that&#39;s what makes her special!<br/>\nVanessa<br/>\nOur lil&#39; sweeties:<br/>\n   Victoria Rose, Madison Grace, and<br/>\n              David Kent<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
