If folks don&#39;t have anything better to do than look for ways to<br/>\neither disect or twist things she says, perhaps they need to look to<br/>\nthemselves to see where the problem lies.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Tia Leschke &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 02, 2001 9:14 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] meanness and curriculum<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bridget, you do have a lot to offer this list.  I&#39;d like to keep on<br/>\nreading<br/>\n&gt; what you have to say about unschooling and all that entails.  I do not<br/>\nwant<br/>\n&gt; to read one more post about your conflict with Sandra.  If you don&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt; what Sandra has to say, stop reading her posts.  This is what I&#39;m going to<br/>\n&gt; have to do with your posts if you can&#39;t put your dislike of her aside and<br/>\n&gt; participate in the group without it.  I&#39;d really rather just be able to<br/>\n&gt; read everyone&#39;s posts.<br/>\n&gt; Tia </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26603,"nextTopicId":26650}}
