Hubby and I grew up in Burlington, MA and <br/>\nall his family is still there.  My family is pretty spread out and <br/>\nmobile, so we thought it would be great to live near family we know <br/>\nwon&#39;t leave as soon as we get there.  We really need a support system <br/>\nbecause Ryan has autism and I want to surround ourselves with people <br/>\nwho would love to help out in a pinch.  Also, the kids really want to <br/>\nlive in the snow!  They both were born in CA and haven&#39;t seen the <br/>\nsnow too much.  It&#39;s a good opportunity to get to know the cousins <br/>\nand grandparents better.  There have been other reasons for us to <br/>\nmove, but that&#39;s the main one.  Besides, I really miss the Fall.  <br/>\nLast fall I was in a funk for about 3 months wishing for some kind of <br/>\nweather change. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope we can meet some more unschoolers when we finally get to MA.<br/>\nKristin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; We currently live in <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hawaii, but are hoping to move to Massachusetts by this fall. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kristin, welcome, and all that...but there is something terribly <br/>\n </span></blockquote>wrong with <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; this statement.
