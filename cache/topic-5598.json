I don&#39;t know all the<br/>\ndetails about starting your own business, but I think there may be different<br/>\nlaws in different states.<br/>\n<br/>\nA free resource you can use is the Better Business Bureau, they have a web<br/>\nsite but I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know the addy.  They can give you specific<br/>\ninformation on how to start a small business, what licenses you might need,<br/>\nphone numbers & addresses you might need, etc.  And it&#39;s all free.  I used<br/>\nto work for them long ago, they have lots of info about lots of things, they<br/>\ndon&#39;t just register complaints and/or conduct mediation/arbritration.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck on you move.<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5596,"nextTopicId":5601}}
