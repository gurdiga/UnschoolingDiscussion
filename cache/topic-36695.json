Holly <br/>\n(10) came back to do something, and as she left she said, &quot;Have a fun shower, <br/>\nmom!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShowers have never been considered &quot;a chore,&quot; either, here.  Showers and <br/>\nbaths are fun.  Kids haven&#39;t been &quot;made&quot; to wash--they do it to play with <br/>\ntoys, or to relax when they&#39;re really tired, or in Marty&#39;s case to shave his <br/>\nhead, or in Kirby&#39;s to wake up before he has to go to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nShowers are taken for real reasons, not because it&#39;s time, or because they&#39;ve <br/>\navoided it until mom made them take one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when they boys were twelvish I might say &quot;Marty, when&#39;s the last <br/>\ntime you had a shower?&quot;  (meaning I smelled him.)  He&#39;d tell me when, and I <br/>\nmight say &quot;Well since you&#39;re going to Logan&#39;s, could you take one before you <br/>\nleave?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI could say &quot;You&#39;re not going to Logan&#39;s if you don&#39;t take a shower.&quot;<br/>\nI could say &quot;You stink, Marty!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut as they got a bit older they became more self-conscious (in a good way) <br/>\nabout clean clothes and clean bodies, and smelling in the <br/>\nneutral-to-attractive range.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are days when there have been other teen boys around all weekend and <br/>\nthey&#39;ve been in Kirby&#39;s room playing video games, sleeping here and there, no <br/>\ngirls around and none expected, and they do begin to smell locker-roomish.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the sentiment &quot;Have a fun shower!&quot; is common, and I&#39;ve said to Holly and <br/>\nothers (including my husband and adult company) LOTS of times things about <br/>\nshowers.  &quot;Feels good, huh?&quot; about showers on hot, dry, summer days.  &quot;I feel <br/>\nSO much better!&quot; when I come out with wet hair.  Or competitions, when kids <br/>\nwere younger, humorous claims of &quot;I&#39;m the cleanest person in this house!&quot; and <br/>\nthe next person to bathe got to brag after that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI see around me, though, enforced, scheduled baths and showers which involve <br/>\nsome pressure, some shaming, some impatience, and I can&#39;t imagine those kids <br/>\nsaying to their moms, or hearing from their moms, &quot;Have a fun shower!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36635,"nextTopicId":36693}}
