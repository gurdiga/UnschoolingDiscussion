And, if you go to the web sites of most of the big software companies <br/>\nthey have free downloads. These are usually only a portion of the game on <br/>\nthe CD, but often they have enough to let you know if this is something your <br/>\nchild will use and enjoy rather than another &#39;bargain buy&#39; that ends up in <br/>\ndrawer gathering dust.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also saves me when the kids see a new software title and want me to buy <br/>\nit-if we have to go look for it on the internet and try it out, it stops <br/>\nalot of those impulse buying urges.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&lt;&lt; Can anyone recommend educational software that would appeal to a 7yo who<br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;  just starting to read?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                                       Hi Annette,  You might try the<br/>\n&gt;www.chumbo.com site.  They have a lot of software, and special offers, too.<br/>\n&gt;For example, they are offering free software on specially marked boxes of<br/>\n&gt;Cheerios, and Chex cereals.  We just ordered software for my almost 6 yo, <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;paid $1.99 to cover the shipping, and that was it.  (We had purchased 3 <br/>\n&gt;boxes<br/>\n&gt;of the cereal, of course, to qualify for the offer, but that&#39;s ok, b/c the<br/>\n&gt;kids eat it anyway.)
