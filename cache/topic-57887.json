I hope I didn&#39;t make my kids out to be overly abusive, they aren&#39;t, just a  impulsive in an agressive way. This list, though overwhelming at times, has been so helpful to get me to confront what I model for my children. I have always considered myself an attachment parenting, warm, loving mother(which I am) but I don&#39;t think I ever noticed the subtle ways that I would show my impatience and frustrations. This list has somehow illuminated some important things that I can now change...and the truth shall set you free!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny thing is that I originally joined with some basic questions about my 10 ds. We have always homeschooled and from the beginning he wouldn&#39;t accept instruction of any kind. I listened to him and backed off though now and again I would borrow something and try it on him always to be rejected. So here I have an incredibly creative, open minded, intelligent and busy 10 year old who is extremely nonacademic. He loves being read to and we read a lot(even with the difficulties of 3 younger siblings). But he is a non reader, non writer, has difficulty with numbers past 20, can&#39;t count money and can barely tell time. This is difficult for me. He says he wants to read but won&#39;t try. What does this mean? I have tried to share some different ways he could learn how: trying to read books alone, doing some kind of program to learn some basic rules etc. What should I do at this point? He is a perfectionist and I think that gets in the way. He doesn&#39;t want to start with &quot;baby&quot; books but he can&#39;t just pick up Harry Potter and read it even though it has been read to him number of times. Do I wait for him to show interest in adding and subtracting? Will he? Do I just let him do whatever and not learn to add, multiply, read on his own? Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again. -Christine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57939,"nextTopicId":57960}}
