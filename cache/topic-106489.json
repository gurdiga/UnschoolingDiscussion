My two older <br/>\nchildren are boys, and they wanted more from the plot than just <br/>\nthe &quot;Love&quot; story that came from it. I loved the deeper meaning of <br/>\nthe <br/>\nfilm...it spoke to me. My husband said, it was an &quot;okay&quot; movie for<br/>\nhim <br/>\nand he sided with the boys on the whole plot issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nI loved it, and I loved how it made since to me. Not too many <br/>\nmovie&#39;s <br/>\nspeak to me, but that one did. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn that note...have you seen the movie &quot;Whale Rider&quot;? I loved that <br/>\nmovie...the young girl in it is wonderful, the music is haunting and <br/>\nwonderful at the same time, and the story is so touching. <br/>\n<br/>\nTracymc<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;my3sonsinva&quot; <br/>\n&lt;my3sonsinva@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Recently I was telling a dad at Karate about homeschooling.
