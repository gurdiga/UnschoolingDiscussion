My husband has had booths for his woodworking  at our big local one for  almost 20  years . When the girls mom (adopted grandaughter) was 9-11 or so she made bracelets  and key rigs out of gimp (plastic lacing) and sold them to other kids  from our tables. She sold them from 50 cents-$1 as I recall. don&#39;t know if it covered the costs of the findings but I guess it did. Actually I bought most of the stuff and she made and sold it.<br/>\nShe helped in the shop whenever she  wanted to  and  when she was a bit older she made  a lot of the cedar  planters etc. and she was paid  by us for that. She was fast and good  at running the chop saw and air nailer. <br/>\nThe girls , age 9 have gotten very good at using the scroll saw and can turn out some pieces that you cant, tell from some of the adult stuff I see but they arent really interested in doing it for sale right now.<br/>\nThey do love the craft faire which is a November institution for us but as they get older they want to buy more from the other booths -that can get a bit crazy.<br/>\nThere is  &quot;always&quot; a sale for stuff priced from 25 c. to about 2$  -the kids at the sale usually have some change  to spend on themselves or friends.I see a few kids every year doing that even though the balance of the craft sale is geared to bigger bucks. <br/>\nthey sell-baking ( cupcakes-cookies etc by the each-plastic bead  things. bead animal key rings, -candles-decorated candies -can&#39;t think what all.<br/>\na few of the kids go on to produce a range of quality items as they get older.Some help a parent produce and sell. <br/>\n A lot just try it once but they  get a kick out of the personal interaction of selling .<br/>\nsometimes it is sad when  a bunch of kids have a whole table full of   higher priced but poorer quality things and they are so embarrased when no one buys. <br/>\nA homeschooling family in our area did that and I just felt so badly for them. the parent just didnt check out the type of sale beforehand.<br/>\nWhat I have seen that doesn&#39;t work is poorly made stuff  that they try to sell to adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps your daughter might gear her things for other kids to buy for their moms-grandmas etc. (little calendars-)<br/>\nIf you live in an area with lots of sales you will probably have to begin checking it out now to book a table. <br/>\nIf she is having fun with the whole thing  it might work.<br/>\nGrace,<br/>\n hearing the scroll saw as I work (as usual)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59461774,"authorName":"Sarah","from":"Sarah &lt;sarahanne1@...&gt;","profile":"sarahanne1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] entrepreneur","postDate":"1095126025","msgId":99574,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwOTE0MDE0MDI1LjEzOTM4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMzEwLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNpNWJqdStlamliQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":99573,"nextInTopic":99575,"prevInTime":99573,"nextInTime":99575,"topicId":99573,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Do you have a farmer s market?
