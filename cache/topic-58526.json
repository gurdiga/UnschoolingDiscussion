Did I *ask* him <br/>\nif he wanted therapy?  No.  And he does not have the cognitive <br/>\nability to understand the question even if I did.  Does *he* <br/>\ndetermine what his goals are for therapy?  Yes &lt;g&gt;.  I&#39;ve seen <br/>\ntherapists try to make my son do what he does *not* want to do, and I <br/>\ncan only admire my son&#39;s tenacity in sticking to his right NOT to do <br/>\nsomething.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, back to unschooling...I learned quite a while ago that my son <br/>\nwill *only* learn what he is motivated to learn; but more <br/>\nimportantly, that he *can* learn when it is something that *he* wants <br/>\nto know.  My role is to recognize what motivates him, and to provide <br/>\nsafe opportunities for him to learn.  I offer materials and <br/>\nactivities that I think he might enjoy, based on his other interests, <br/>\nand he is free to choose what he wants to do.  I believe in him, and <br/>\nhis right to a life that makes him happy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis belief in my youngest child led me to look at my other children, <br/>\nand gradually my dh and I began to reevaluate all that we thought we <br/>\nknew about homeschooling, education and learning.  I still don&#39;t call <br/>\nmyself an *unschooler* or what we do as *unschooling*.  I have an <br/>\ninstinctive resistance to labels, I suppose.  I do admit, though, <br/>\nthat we are closer to *unschooling* than anything else on the <br/>\nhomeschool continuum.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the length...my son&#39;s story doesn&#39;t really have a condensed <br/>\nversion. &lt;g&gt; I hope that other parents raising children with special <br/>\nneeds will recognize that even the most disabled child has the right <br/>\nto make choices for his life, no matter how limited that life might <br/>\nbe.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Does unschooling work for everyone?","postDate":"1045027951","msgId":58526,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyNS4xZTIwOTI3Ny4yYjdiMzY2ZkBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":58531,"prevInTime":58525,"nextInTime":58527,"topicId":58526,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/11/03 8:26:35 PM Central Standard Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-283414861\">In a message dated 2/11/03 8:26:35 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Where can I find the article to which you refer?
