If you <br/>\nare not totally adverse to workbooks there are TONS out there to look at. <br/>\nAlso, I wanted my kids to learn to print in a way that would make the <br/>\ntransition to cursive easier so I taught them Italic handwriting. There are <br/>\nalso TONS of workbooks for that as well. If you e-mail me privately I will <br/>\nlook through out my font files to see where I got the &quot;Penmanship Print&quot; <br/>\nfont, I believe it was a free download, but I am not sure. I will start my <br/>\nsearch. I know that as unschoolers most of us don&#39;t use workbooks, but when <br/>\nmy in-laws and parents have gotten that &quot;my grandkids aren&#39;t learning what <br/>\nthey should be&quot; bug up their... and they send us books and workbooks, my kids <br/>\ndo seem to enjoy using them on their own terms and when/how they want. (not <br/>\nusually how the instructions say to use them) So getting a few handwriting <br/>\nworkbooks that are bright and easy, w/o too much &quot;teacher&quot; in them isn&#39;t too <br/>\nbad. (In my opinion.) Let us know how this works out! And as for bi-lingual <br/>\nkids, we have found that exposure is the best! We live in a mixed <br/>\nneighborhood where english and spanish are spoken, both my children like to <br/>\ngo to friends homes and learn spanish from their friends and their friends <br/>\nparents. We also have a spanish CD rom for the kids to use. It is a bit <br/>\nschoolish, and geared toward older teens and adults, but the kids do like <br/>\nfinding words they know and learning new ones to &quot;show off&quot; Good Luck!:o) <br/>\n~Nancy <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22610,"nextTopicId":22617}}
