We celebrate Christmas but we also<br/>\ncelebrate Winter Solstice.  We spend an afternoon walking around wooded<br/>\nareas looking for just the right log and then decorate it with berries,<br/>\nleaves, grasses, etc..  On Winter Solstice, we don&#39;t use any lights.  As<br/>\nevening comes, the house gets darker and darker.  I have usually made some<br/>\nkind of comfort  food dinner.  Then we burn the Yule log and all sit around<br/>\nthe fireplace, talking and laughing.  It is so calming.  We have done this<br/>\nfor several years and the kids really look forward to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49345,"nextTopicId":49208}}
