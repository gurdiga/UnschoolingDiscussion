I also have 2 younger <br/>\nchildren. When I feel I can no longer keep up with my girl&#39;s constant need <br/>\nfor me, I invite friends over or get invited to friend&#39;s houses. She has a <br/>\nconstant need for sharing her life. It is how she learns. She does not nor <br/>\ncan I expect her to be alone and thrive. Aloneness is a type of punishment <br/>\nfor Ashley. When I hear I am bored, which happens after hanging out with our <br/>\nschooled friends by the way, I say my mantra,<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;boredom is the soil from which sprouts creativity.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids get very tired of this. I really say it over and over if they come <br/>\nto me bored. The schooled friends of ours think I&#39;m nuts, but they get it. <br/>\nAshley&#39;s mom does not fix our state of boredom. I also invite my daughter to <br/>\nhang out with me and fold laundry or wash or cook. Sometimes she does, but <br/>\nusually she will find herself having lots of ideas of activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have cool stuff sitting around unused, I find if i move stuff, <br/>\nmaybe check out a kit, the kids are all over me to play with it. Yesterday <br/>\nwe were doing a group stamping project, so I was sorting the stamps, <br/>\nchecking the ink pads. My three kids stamped for over 1 hour. The stamps are <br/>\nin reach, yet sat untouched until I touched them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thoughts so far. As for new baby, they are so fun for older siblings to <br/>\nhelp with and an 8 year old can do lots of important jobs including holding <br/>\nand rocking and burping. Including your son in as much baby stuff as you can <br/>\nmay help satisfy his need to be with you. My older got to watch newborn alot <br/>\nwhile I took my daily shower.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37237,"nextTopicId":37253}}
