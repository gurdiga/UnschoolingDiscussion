We have only been h/s unschooling for 8 months <br/>\nand like your son, she is very unmotivated.  She is very anti <br/>\nanything that smells of school.  And like you I was getting very <br/>\nfrustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere in New Zealand it is the ps hols - so I havent bothered too much <br/>\nabout school - not that we do school any more at any time - Anyway, <br/>\nmy dd has read several books from the library - she very rarely reads <br/>\nbooks - made a cake - wrote a story - made up a dance - explored the <br/>\nrock pools - learned that bats fly by sonar - played shops with a <br/>\nfriend - we have played the Game of Knowledge - and she has been <br/>\nswimming. Just to mention a few.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a child who during *school term* lays in bed half the day.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who will climb into bed with her son when she isn&#39;t <br/>\ntalking to her husband, and he is 18yrs old!!!!!<br/>\nI think it is pretty cool that yoou have such a close relationship <br/>\nwith your son.<br/>\nMy dd used to climb in bed with me almost every night when my husband <br/>\nworked away.<br/>\nmarianne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15091,"nextTopicId":15063}}
