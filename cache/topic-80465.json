I&#39;m really glad you are writing things about acoc, because feeling guilty all the time, or wondering if your doing it right because of all the old tapes etc. is really hard.  I feel like I&#39;m at home in this one.  The other day my mom was harrassing my 9 year old son.  I feel like she likes to see him get mad and &quot;disrespect&quot; her to 1) see how I will react or what I will do  or  2) she actually enjoys tormenting this child.  I do say stop mom and redirect the situation, send F out to play etc. and generally over ride her and she usually leaves in a huff.  good who cares LOL .  It gets to the point of ridiculous.  The other day she actually pinched his nose very hard to the point that his eyes watered.  She was giving us a ride some place.  How can you have a relationship with a grandma like that?   And she used to drink a lot and heavily, sometimes she just was ugly just because or what ever.  It makes me so angry that she thinks or I think she thinks that she is picking up where I am lacking. I was just thinking the other day that I am 45 years old and I have issues damn it and they just won&#39;t go away.  I just have to deal with them.  I left home and got married at 16 and yes had my own teddy bear too.  And I remember thinking &quot;finally something of my own.  That beautiful baby girl that I could love unconditionally and she loved me back very well. Well this turned into a rant.  sorry.

How wonderful that your sister and her husband quit because of your letter.  I once wrote a letter to my dad about how his intense smoking was scaring me because I felt my kids might not end up with any grandparents on my side (my mother had already died) and he quit for a few years from that letter.  He had already quit drinking. I hadn&#39;t thought about how free our lives are of the alcoholic insanity I grew up with.  My kids don&#39;t walk on egg shells and aren&#39;t &quot;toughened up&quot; at all.  It&#39;s a good realization.<br/>\n <br/>\nHowever,  I have been struggling lately with the emotions that come up in me when my more volatile son ignores me or gets really hyper.  I just lose it, inside.  I take a time-out, which usually calms me down pretty quickly.   But there are times when I yell.  I sometimes think he is smiling at my rising emotion, seeing if he can get it to erupt.  It&#39;s entertainment.  i don&#39;t think he feels nervous or unsafe, just likes the game.  I guess it&#39;s good that he isn&#39;t scared.  I&#39;ll think I&#39;ve broken the pattern and then i&#39;ll have a tired day or  be feeling emotional anyway and I lose my patience.  I find that I take it out on my dog and cat (verbally, and not in a big way) and not on my kids, as a rule.  I have been blaming this on my exhaustion when i am having a difficult bout of Chronic Fatigue (it comes and goes).  But maybe I should invest some time in adult chil. of alc. reading or meetings.

What<br/>\nelse did they know?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husbands whole family all just say things in the spur of the moment, very<br/>\nhurtful things that the next day they have forgotten all about. I&#39;m a strong<br/>\nbeliever, for me, not to say anything I don&#39;t really mean. I may be unclear<br/>\nabout things, but I won&#39;t tell someone to drop dead or that I hate them or<br/>\ncall them a name just because I may be upset.  I have always been aware of<br/>\nhow personal and hurtful words can be. I know they are &quot;just words&quot; but for<br/>\nme, I&#39;m just very careful in what comes out. Especially when I&#39;m upset.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo all the years of fighting and arguing and saying mean things with my<br/>\nhusbands family pretty much rolls right off his back. He grew up not knowing<br/>\nhow to communicate any other way. (with them) Surprisingly, he isn&#39;t that<br/>\nway with anyone else but them. They on the other hand are like that with<br/>\neveryone. If he wasn&#39;t the spitting image of his dad, I&#39;d swear he was<br/>\nadopted!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the more reason I think for me to be so careful about how I speak around<br/>\nand with my kids and how they in turn treat others. I like when on this list<br/>\nSandra will point out to her kids how maybe something they say or do is fine<br/>\naround each other but others may not always interpret those words or actions<br/>\nin the same way. I think that is very important for children to understand.<br/>\nI like that someone is saying it&#39;s okay here with me and the family, but<br/>\nsomeone else just may look at it differently. It makes the child aware of<br/>\nothers and the choices they can and will make accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s late, does all that make sense?!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":159022987,"authorName":"Olga","from":"&quot;Olga&quot; &lt;mccluskieo@...&gt;","profile":"britcontoo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Kids being tough","postDate":"1063598492","msgId":80509,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJrM2Rpcys5YXA1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNGEwMWMzN2IzMyQxZmQ2NmE0MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":80505,"nextInTopic":80513,"prevInTime":80508,"nextInTime":80510,"topicId":80465,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Mary, I think this is an excellent point:   ... dying) and no ... handle things ... across.

They may be over it, but the person <br/>\nwho is hurt may not be for some time.  This is a big issue with my <br/>\nfamily where my mom says hurtful things and thinks that sorry or <br/>\nsome excuse to point the finger else where is enough.  On the <br/>\nsurface it may be forgotten but it lingers in your heart for much <br/>\nlonger.  Obviously, it is different with children but as mentioned <br/>\nmany times before on this topic kids need to understand that the <br/>\nconsequences for such behavior can create a wound that might not be <br/>\neasy to heal.  It&#39;s kinda reminds me of that Mercer Mayer book &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nSorry&quot; where he does a bunch of things and thinks saying sorry is <br/>\nenough and Mom finally says sometimes that is not good enough.  I <br/>\nrefer to this story with my son all the time with much more minor <br/>\nbehavior.   I just gently remind him of the book and that we have to <br/>\nwork on that behavoir not just use sorry as a bandage.    I am not <br/>\nimplying that with any particular case discussed here as I know it <br/>\ngoes much deeper and everyone has mentioned reminding their children <br/>\nof this.

My first thought was when my sister in law<br/>\ncame to my house on the premise of handing over a belated birthday gift to<br/>\nSierra. Once inside, she went off on me big time. Things from years ago that<br/>\nmade no sense. To me, she went nuts. I&#39;m not used to seeing people act that<br/>\nway. I would say she was a lunatic. My husband didn&#39;t see anything so<br/>\nabsurd. He was used to it. But when she really went nuts, he wasn&#39;t home. I<br/>\nwas home with the kids and I asked her to leave. Then I told her to leave.<br/>\nShe refused and followed me through my house yelling like a nut. My kids<br/>\nwere scared and very confused. They just didn&#39;t handle that well. They had<br/>\nnever been around that kind of behavior. Sierra ran into my moms. I put<br/>\nAlyssa and Joseph together in his room and Tara headed for hers.

I have a long story but has <br/>\nto do with why some kids can be tough enough to ignore rage while others <br/>\naren&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister and I had an alcoholic mother.  She threw a fit so big and so bad <br/>\none day they put her in the hospital for two weeks where she resisted <br/>\ncounseling, refused drugs, and came home worse than ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not alcoholic.  My sister is (but doesn&#39;t drink any more).<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I left my home town, I didn&#39;t think too much about the fact that I was <br/>\nliving where there wasn&#39;t a lot of alcohol around, and life moves on through <br/>\nthe years.  Keith and I  were together seven years before we had a baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom quit drinking when Kirby was one, and quit for nine years.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby was two when my mom and I went to visit Irene, my sister, who&#39;s three <br/>\nyears younger.   She had three kids then, the oldest five.    They lived in El <br/>\nDuende, across the Rio Grande from San Juan Pueblo.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were going to spend the night.  My mom was taking a nap in my sister&#39;s <br/>\ncamper van, near the door to the house.   My sister, brother-in-law, and a male <br/>\nfriend of ours their age (we&#39;ve known him all our lives, his parents were <br/>\nBaptist missionaries who translated the Bible into Tewa) were there drinking in the <br/>\nkitchen, where we were sitting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIrene&#39;s three kids were lined up on the couch watching cartoons in the next <br/>\nroom.   I could see them all through the door from where I was sitting.  Kirby <br/>\nwas sometimes playing with toys, sometimes visiting the other kids on the <br/>\ncouch, sometimes nursing.  It got dark.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey drank and drank, and we were talking, and after a while my brother in <br/>\nlaw got insulting.   I asked him not to be that way.  He insulted that.  Don, <br/>\nthe friend, got into years&#39; old stuff, for fun, just razzing and poking, <br/>\ndefending Gene, for fun.  It wasn&#39;t going to be any fun for me.  I tried  changing <br/>\nsubjects, saying nice things, and they wouldn&#39;t have it.  It was verbal, not <br/>\nphysical, but they were totally into having a fight.  Kirby was scared of the <br/>\nyelling, and scooted out to go see his granny.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey laughed at him for being afraid, and said he was a &quot;titty-baby&quot; and if I <br/>\nhadn&#39;t nursed him after he could walk, he wouldn&#39;t be such a little baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that point I was getting pretty cranky, because I don&#39;t drive well after <br/>\ndark.  I can see fine, but I get sleepy.   So I felt trapped, 90 miles from <br/>\nhome, with crazed drunks intent on hooting until they passed out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom came in, watched the situation for a minute, and said &quot;I think we <br/>\nshould just go on back to Albuquerque.&quot;   By then I was angry enough I could have <br/>\nstayed awake to El Paso if I&#39;d needed to.   So I got our stuff and said we <br/>\nwere going, which was met by nonsense like &quot;Oh, don&#39;t go, we were just playing, <br/>\nyou were going to spend the night, you should stay.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got in the van and started driving, my mom said what Kirby had done <br/>\nwas come out in the total darkness, open the van himself, rush up onto the bed <br/>\nwhere she was and say &quot;Granny, there&#39;s a monster in there!&quot;  He had never <br/>\ncried or anything, just become really alert and worried, and gotten help.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the way home I was feeling mixed fury and elation.   Until that incident I <br/>\nhadn&#39;t seen how free of alcoholic insanity my life with Keith was.  I REALLY <br/>\nhad not noticed the huge difference between a life with resident drunks and <br/>\none without.  When our drinking friends visited, or we visited them, it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nthe same situation as living with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got home I wrote my sister a long letter telling her what I had <br/>\nthought on the way home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest and most telling thing of all was that through all the yelling, <br/>\nthrough all the insults, through people deciding to go home and leaving, <br/>\nIrene&#39;s kids didn&#39;t look away from the TV.  They sat as calmly as though the house <br/>\nhad been quiet.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby wasn&#39;t afraid because he had been nursed.  He was afraid because in <br/>\nover two years of life he had never ever yet once seen drunks yelling at each <br/>\nother.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was his age, I had. <br/>\nWhen Irene was his age, she had.<br/>\nTheir children obviously had heard it all before and it was no big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had resolved that night to continue to protect my kids from that kind of <br/>\nbehavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s really wonderful about the story is that my sister and brother in law <br/>\ndecided to stop drinking when they got my letter, and they still don&#39;t drink.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was fifteen years ago.  They got a divorce last year, and I was afraid <br/>\nGene, at least, would drink in the wake of that horrible separation and <br/>\ndivorce, but he didn&#39;t.  Neither did Irene.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are horrified when they see someone swat a child, and I&#39;m glad.  It&#39;s <br/>\nnot a weakness, it&#39;s a strength.  They&#39;re offended if a parent speaks really <br/>\nhatefully or sarcastically to a child, or when a parent laughs at his own <br/>\nchild in front of other people.  I think that makes them better people and will <br/>\nmake them better parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was tough as a kid.  When drunks woke me up yelling in the next room, I <br/>\njust went back to sleep, knowing they&#39;d eventually run out of liquor or pass out <br/>\nor both.   I wouldn&#39;t let drunks wake my kids up now if they&#39;re asleep.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t even let sober people make so much noise they wake other people up.  That&#39;s <br/>\nan example of a principle.  The people who live in a house have the right to <br/>\nsleep, even if they&#39;re little people.  I don&#39;t have to give anyone the right <br/>\nor power to disturb my children&#39;s peace in their own space.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80559,"nextTopicId":80468}}
