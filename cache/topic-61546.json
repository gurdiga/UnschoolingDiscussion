Censor a book? Nope.<br/>\n  Expose them to something inappropriate before they are<br/>\n  ready? Nope. Read it with them and discuss it when<br/>\n  they are? Absolutely!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  How could you possibly know when your kids are ready for something that they aren&#39;t exposed to so they can chose on their own? You monitor what they can see when they can see it. You could be keeping them from all sorts of interests you may never know they have. And if the time comes that you do introduce these interests to them, you may have missed the window for them when it would have been interesting. And what about things that interest you and not them? Will they have to sit through it because you think they should?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    &lt;&lt;I do realize that my children may very well have<br/>\n    different opinions than me as they grow, and I can<br/>\n    handle that. They may enjoy things I wouldn&#39;t at all,<br/>\n    so what? We&#39;re different people.Already my oldest,<br/>\n    who just turned 7, has stated emphatically that she<br/>\n    will NEVER be a reader like I am. I&#39;ve already told<br/>\n    her that&#39;s all fine and dandy but she still needs to<br/>\n    BE ABLE TO READ.&gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Opinions are one thing, interests are something totally different. When children are young, one of the best ways to encourage them to find their interests is by providing all sorts of things for them to look at, hear, smell and taste. They are the best judge of what interests them. They pick apart small pieces of what they see and hear to discover their own interests.<br/>\n    And did you ever think that by making your daughter read, because YOU say she needs to be able to, is why she feels the way she does about not reading like you?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    &lt;&lt;I am a visual/kinestheic learner and Sarah is an<br/>\n    auditory learner. So what? Am I holding her back by<br/>\n    making sure she knows how to read? Not at all. I&#39;m<br/>\n    giving her computer software based phonics instruction<br/>\n    and everything else we can think of INCLUDING her<br/>\n    attendence at a local public school under an IEP for<br/>\n    language arts tutoring.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    Yes you probably are. By not letting her discover all this on her own, you may very well be squashing her interests and not letting her discover how wonderful it is to learn on one&#39;s own. Just because you really want to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    &lt;&lt;My best learning experiences growing up were ones I<br/>\n    took upon myself. I want that for my children as they<br/>\n    grow older and have a firm foundation of reading,<br/>\n    writing, mathematics and a basic understanding of<br/>\n    history and sciences&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I think we all can agree on what you have said here. But what you say and think seem to be different than what you are telling us you do with your children. If learning and growing on your own were the best experiences, then why restrict tv and make a point to tell you children they really need to read. Probably before they are even ready to do so and are interested in it. I fyou want that for your children, then why not let them have it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    &lt;&lt;I may not be unschooling them at the moment, and we<br/>\n    may never totally forgo any sort of written<br/>\n    curriculum, and while we&#39;re totally enjoying the<br/>\n    curriculum we are using right now I don&#39;t want it to<br/>\n    be everything they learn from or how; but that doesn&#39;t<br/>\n    mean that unschooling won&#39;t work for us.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Well no you aren&#39;t unschooling now and if you can&#39;t even see yourself gettting rid of the curriculum, then you won&#39;t ever be unschooling. And it does mean that unschooling won&#39;t work for you. People unschool here every day and it works. When you come into this defending school stuff, not seeing anything else but in school terms, then it seems as if you are unwilling to look at what unschooling really is. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Mary B<br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Reply to Sandra","postDate":"1048391451","msgId":61620,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5Mi4xN2FjMjc0MC4yYmFlODkxYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61619,"nextInTopic":61623,"prevInTime":61619,"nextInTime":61621,"topicId":61546,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/22/2003 10:41:49 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
