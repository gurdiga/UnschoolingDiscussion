Also I urge you to look into getting your groceries delivered. *********<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn -<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your advice.  It would be wonderful if I could afford that, but I can&#39;t.  We live penny to penny here - we usually end up with too much month left at the end of the money...  I have no &quot;extra&quot; to spend.  This is part of why I am moving.  I had moved in when I divorced, and it was supposed to be temporary.  My mother&#39;s health delcined and it has become a 7 year kind of temporary... I have been taking care of all the bills, etc... on this massive house that my mother cannot afford on her own.  She&#39;s been planning on moving for 5 years now, and I have finally decided enough is enough.  If she looses everything, then so be it - I&#39;ve been here and available to &quot;help&quot; and now I feel that I am hindering.  We have to go - for my sanity, my daughters, and even to save my mother&#39;s an my relationship. Anyway, thank you... Do you know any other suggestions that may be more financially feasible right now?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
