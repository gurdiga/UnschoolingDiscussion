They learned freely how to spell, in various ways, by asking when they wanted to, by looking things up, using a spellchecker (carefully�not always trusting what the spellchecker thought they were trying to say) AND by being okay with misspellings, knowing that communication was the point, not perfection.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Keith and I had been unschooling so that WE the parents would seem cool and exctingly &quot;radical&quot; (that is a whole different &#39;radical&#39; than the one intended in &quot;radical unschooling&quot; for the past 20 years), our children would be secondary to the whole project, and their learning would be way down the line.  We might have, if we were unschooling for our own sakes, even discouraged them from learning to spell because it might seem cooler for them to spell wildly, to prove we were UNSCHOOLERS!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s not what we did.  We began with the peace and fun of attachment parenting, and the learning they had already been doing, and then did not add school. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, if anyone has joined here lately and your unschooling, because of your nearest conferences or other influences, has been a raucous party of &quot;ain&#39;t we COOL!,&quot; please try to turn more toward your children, and calmness and peace, support and security, and learning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor people who have thought of quitting good jobs and risking poverty because someone suggested that was the way to REALLY be unschoolers, please find better influences.  One of the parents ought to have a job.  ANY parents should be providing food and shelter, a soft, quiet place to sleep, a good place to keep things.  And if &quot;the job&quot; a family has is taking money from other unschoolers, that&#39;s not a very good example of the way unschooling works best.  If a &quot;job&quot; involves leaving a young child for a week to tell other people to be closer to their children, think carefully.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas should make sense to you before you change anything in your life.  Some ideas only make sense when you try them out.  It&#39;s a paradox.  People need to hurry and unschool without rushing in to it.  People can&#39;t wait forever, or it&#39;s too late.  But if they move too far too fast, it can make a mess.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why &quot;read a little, try a litle, wait a while, watch&quot; works.  Repeat it, as you understand more.   Read a little (of what it seems you need to think about at that moment), try a little (relax in that area, see if you can change just a little reaction or two, or lean toward the way you want to be), wait a while (give it some time) and watch (observe, feel, wait for evidence or feedback or assess your own thoughts and responses).  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/leaning-toward-balance.html\">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/leaning-toward-balance.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"Karen","from":"&quot;Karen&quot; &lt;semajrak@...&gt;","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Integrity","postDate":"1373940896","msgId":71738,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtzMmFiMCtsYmd0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNzM5MzMyNTkuMzE4ODguWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMDkwNC5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":71737,"nextInTopic":71739,"prevInTime":71737,"nextInTime":71739,"topicId":71722,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The same holds true for many writers here on Always Learning, which has been my source of inspiration and education on unschooling for years now.  For every one person that is full of shit (forgive me), there are many that benefit greatly from what you and others share.  My homeschooling and family life would be less joyful and much more anxiety laced if it wasn&#39;t for the ideas I have followed and personally scrutinized here on this list (and I like the Facebook group too).<br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand your reservation though, and I share your skepticism occasionally.  There have been times where I&#39;ve questioned whether a person *should* be unschooling at all.  I don&#39;t think we can do anything about people who claim to be something they are not.  Time will out them if they do not attempt to change their ways.  What concerns me is the families who have placed all of their aspirations for success in unschooling on an illusion.  That must be so frustrating and confusing.  Maddening even.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple weeks ago, a friend of ours, who is schooled, was talking about his spelling tests.  Now, I&#39;ve witnessed both my son and this friend typing and spelling together in computer games for a couple of years now.  They both do well.  The thing that stood out for me was just that.  They both do well.  My son has learned to spell naturally, by reading, writing, asking questions, comparing etc.  This boy has too, but he has also had several years of spelling tests to measure his success against.  He thinks he knows he can spell well because he got 9 out of 10 on a test.  My son knows he can spell well because he got the word he wanted to spell right.  There inlies the difference for me.  Not that one boy is better than the other, but rather that one boy feels his success, and the other waits to be told about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat preserved sense of confidence in one&#39;s own inherent ability to learn, to me, is so precious.  I feel for the families that leave or dismiss unschooling due to poor examples of it.

I hired tutors, created diaries and schedules... The usual story. And looked around the home ed community here in the uk for guidance. But. No family was the same as us, no combination of personality and circumstance the same ( of course).  I realised that I could not look to somebody, some curriculum, as all externally imposed ideas did not sit with INTEGRITY in our household. They niggled and felt uncomfortable. And so began the slow, scary realisation that it was something I needed to work out for MYSELF! By waiting, watching seeing how it went, then adjusting, waiting, watching, experimenting. I gradually began to breathe again and find MY integrity.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it was with great relief that this forum came into focus, as I was already waiting, watching, and really excited about coming from a place of thought, and first principles, being free from being told how things should be. Asking, watching, and making genuine observations and acting upon those observations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose we are always looking for validation of our own ideas, and actions, especially when they are so against the flow of society. But it&#39;s important that integrity comes from your own observations and reactions, of others and your own family dynamic. It&#39;s a funny road to go down if we are looking to Internet chat forums to tell us how to be with our own children. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust nice to find like minded souls to spar ideas with and to make observations of to add to my information gathering...I don&#39;t worry if they have &#39;integrity&#39; or not as if what they say feels wrong I reject it, I am not looking for a &#39;how to&#39; guide.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder of course how this will all &#39;turn out&#39;, but if each day is lived with integrity then doesn&#39;t that amount to a life?</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":221591978,"authorName":"Bernadette Lynn","from":"Bernadette Lynn &lt;bernadette.lynn@...&gt;","profile":"bwalyalynn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Integrity","postDate":"1373907086","msgId":71740,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTTZBM04yREJEeHZtTzZ0c1VpUUdoU0FnSjAtZkZTV25WM2J3UkNfMFZwT01ZVXBQZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT09UYVhNLVRRdkNVRXlTTkVkem1WdmpKbUtNdnk4VkMxMm91TnhRTmdZcldmLXFZd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEIwRkQxMkU2LTc0QTktNDM2Ny05MTA1LTAxRjEwRDBBQTRGNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPENBT09UYVhNLVRRdkNVRXlTTkVkem1WdmpKbUtNdnk4VkMxMm91TnhRTmdZcldmLXFZd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71739,"nextInTopic":71741,"prevInTime":71739,"nextInTime":71741,"topicId":71722,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There are certain positions of trust�priests, doctors, teachers, leaders�where there is an extra level of responsibility to live a life with respect to ideals.  If a private or sergeant has an affair, it&#39;s not as big a deal as if a general does.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong academics, there are &quot;degrees&quot;�bachelors, masters, doctor of philosophy�and those who are at that rank or higher examine and approve new graduates.   We don&#39;t have that among unschoolers, nor should we. It would be a nightmare of gigantic proportions, and there would be people who would lie and cheat to get those (because there are people who lie and cheat, already, to get those others, or claim to have them when they don&#39;t).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone makes a blatantly false claim (to have a PhD they don&#39;t have, or a Master&#39;s degree they don&#39;t have, or say &quot;leader in the field for a decade&quot; when they 1) haven&#39;t been around that long, and 2) aren&#39;t leading anyone except those who will believe made-up claims, it&#39;s possible that others should state as much.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut learning exists as water, and air, in the whole world.  Unschooling isn&#39;t centralized at a factory, and there is no front gate on which we can put warnings and notices and announcements.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAuthenticity is a problem because of things like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I know that this is only a set-back and it is only a matter of time before I come back stronger, healthier and more authentic than I was before.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSet back on the path to... what?<br/>\nCome back... where?  <br/>\nMore authentic?  That&#39;s an admission of having been inauthentic, or dishonest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe can&#39;t &quot;come back.&quot;  We are, all of us, alive in this moment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we&#39;re being responsible unschooling parents, we will be with our children as much as we can be, and help other unschoolers because  unschoolers helped us.   <br/>\n<br/>\nLa Leche League leaders and other members helped me freely.<br/>\nAdult Children of Alcoholics members helped me freely.<br/>\nI have helped other unschoolers freely since Kirby first didn&#39;t go to school, and our weekly playgroup that had been a La Leche League-based playgroup started evolving into an unschooling playgroup called &quot;The Goof Group.&quot;  That was 1990. :-)    If I were not who I said I was, that playgroup would&#39;ve bombed and died out in no time, but it lasted until 1999 or so, when Kirby and Marty said they were tired of it and could we please stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have lived my unschooling life in public.  My children agreed to let me share their experiences so that other children&#39;s lives would be better, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had left my very young children for a week to help other people be better mothers, that wouldn&#39;t have been evidence that I knew what a really attentive mother should do.

The money that comes in the mail - without being solicited - I do not use for myself; I use it for printing and postage. Those who attempt to buy spiritual truth are trying to get it before they are ready. In this wonderfully well-ordered universe, when they are ready, it will be given.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was immediately reminded me of those who charge for unschooling advice via consultation fees, etc.  And when she says &quot;Those who attempt to buy spiritual truth are trying to get it before they are ready&quot; I think that the word Spiritual could be replaced with the word unschooling and fit perfectly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone tries to Buy the Right answers, and pay for How To Unschool lessons :-) I think that is exactly because they&#39;re not ready to Get It - and they&#39;re hoping it can be paid for and installed.  And they are bound to be disappointed when the person they are Paying cannot make that happen for them.  And even *more* disappointed when the person they&#39;re trying to Buy unschooling from turns out to be a better Salesman than they are unschooler themselves :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think to unschool well and happily, rather than thinking unschooling can be Bought like shoes and salad :-) and then installed or devoured, one needs to Get It from within, and not have it Applied from without.  And I think for help along the way, one should look for the Peace Pilgrims who will help folks think for themselves, who literally walk their talk (she sure did!) and who are not looking to turn a Profit for something that&#39;s right out there, Free and in the world, for anyone who wants to make it their own.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinion :-)<br/>\nColleen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Integrity","postDate":"1373882507","msgId":71729,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1OTEyQTdCLUU0MzgtNDJDNC1BOERCLUI2MDFBRkI4MjVCREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDgzQkM1RTVCLUVEMDAtNDc4RS05OThDLTlBOUZDREQzMDcyMkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PEIwRkQxMkU2LTc0QTktNDM2Ny05MTA1LTAxRjEwRDBBQTRGNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDgzQkM1RTVCLUVEMDAtNDc4RS05OThDLTlBOUZDREQzMDcyMkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":71728,"nextInTopic":71730,"prevInTime":71728,"nextInTime":71730,"topicId":71722,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I m thinking back to the early AOL days when most unschoolers didn t know each other and most had young kids.

You couldn&#39;t know if an unschooler was presenting a true picture. And unschoolers were only reporting what was working with younger kids, like learning to read. There weren&#39;t enough grown unschooled kids to know for sure that they could get into college or that they&#39;d turn into decent people. There was no proof of the outcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was important was whether the ideas held together logically. *And* whether unschoolers were independently reporting similar results. *And*, where the results were different, whether that unschooler would allow her &quot;experiment&quot; to be pulled pulled apart and examined to see why the results were different.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen data gathering and analysis is the basis for decision making, if one person isn&#39;t presenting a true picture, it doesn&#39;t matter. The emerging truth doesn&#39;t depend on one person. It depends on many people showing consistent results. It depends on being able to look at what&#39;s going on when the results are different.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen integrity matters for decision making, is when you base your decisions on the ideas of one person such as when you can&#39;t analyze any data to see if what they&#39;re saying holds together. Or when you don&#39;t care about proof and care more about being inspired.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with following one person&#39;s ideas is they can say inspiring words that sound true. If what they say has a lot of emotional resonance, proof that it&#39;ll work doesn&#39;t seem important. It *feels* like it will work.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, that&#39;s the definition of guru. Guru can mean expert or whiz, but, for me, what sets guru apart is the element of spiritual inspiration. People go to hear gurus to get inspired. <br/>\n<br/>\nGurus don&#39;t need proof. Their worth (as gurus) comes from how well they can arouse emotions and make people feel good about an idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people do make decisions based on emotion, on what feels right. That&#39;s not bad. Analytical decision making is better for some things. Emotional decision making is better for other things. But emotional decision makers are highly vulnerable to gurus who can be inspiring without being true.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we&#39;ve been doing on the various forums that Sandra keeps focused and on topic is analyzing everyone&#39;s experiment. The data is all here. More comes in all the time. There&#39;s 70,000+ messages in the archives that can be mined for more. There&#39;s more on the Unschooling Discussion lists (that have fallen quiet). Anyone can analyze the data, pull it apart, ask questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere people presenting a true picture matters *here* is if someone doesn&#39;t want to analyze data, just wants to trust what&#39;s being said is true.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good use of these forums. But *because* the members report consistent results *and* allow what they&#39;re doing to be pulled apart, because the regular posters have been consistent with what they say about their lives over the years, because some have made themselves and their families available for others to see in real life it can be used that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra is who she presents herself as. I&#39;ve met her many times, been to her house, met all her kids. But the integrity of what&#39;s said here doesn&#39;t *depend* on Sandra presenting a true picture of herself because it&#39;s based on data that&#39;s been subject to analysis and that anyone can also analyze themselves. Sandra&#39;s value, as far as the integrity of what&#39;s read here is concerned, is in maintaining an atmosphere where what&#39;s posted is scrutinized and questioned and kept on topic. So people *can* trust what&#39;s read here without analyzing for themselves. But that isn&#39;t encouraged.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if someone is following one person because their words are emotionally stirring, it&#39;s very easy to get sucked in by someone who isn&#39;t painting a true picture. That&#39;s the big fat downside of depending on a person rather than data and thoughtful analysis. The best way avoid being surprised by gurus is to not follow gurus and instead frequent places where thoughtful analysis is the norm and do your own thinking and analysis.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Integrity","postDate":"1373870781","msgId":71727,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdDNDMwNDQ0LUIwNTctNDUyQy04NzVCLUQzRjAyNkVGRjdEMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEUxNjExRUYxLUJGNjAtNDg1RS04MUYwLTc1RkFBNTZBRTZDQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEIwRkQxMkU2LTc0QTktNDM2Ny05MTA1LTAxRjEwRDBBQTRGNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPENBT09UYVhNLVRRdkNVRXlTTkVkem1WdmpKbUtNdnk4VkMxMm91TnhRTmdZcldmLXFZd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPEUxNjExRUYxLUJGNjAtNDg1RS04MUYwLTc1RkFBNTZBRTZDQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71726,"nextInTopic":71728,"prevInTime":71726,"nextInTime":71728,"topicId":71722,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I misspelled a word.

It&#39;s just not a term I like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like &quot;integrity.&quot;  It doesn&#39;t mean the same thing; I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a replacement term, but it might be a better way to consider whether a person is trustworthy (if that&#39;s the question).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71711,"nextTopicId":71742}}
