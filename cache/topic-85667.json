My DS was warming up <br/>\nwith two other boys before Tae Kwon Do class. Inevitable &quot;where do you go to <br/>\nschool?&quot; &quot;I homeschool&quot; conversation. The others boys could not understand -- <br/>\nyou could just see the deeply puzzled looks on their faces -- my son&#39;s <br/>\nexplanation of being at home and just having fun all day. &quot;You don&#39;t have to do <br/>\nworksheets?&quot; was asked at least 3 times. &quot;What about homework?&quot; DS: &quot;Well, I&#39;m at <br/>\nhome, smile, so there&#39;s no homework.&quot; Puzzled looks. &quot;What about worksheets?&quot; DS <br/>\ntried to explain that it was like TKD, you like the class and you practice <br/>\nwhen you want to at home and you keep going and you learn. And he told them about <br/>\ncomputer stuff he does and they seemed to get that. &quot;But you don&#39;t have to do <br/>\nworksheets?&quot; I left then and TKD started soon but I&#39;m not sure the two boys <br/>\ngot much out of the conversation -- but I think DS, once again (he survived 7 <br/>\nmonths of K and was bored to tears), was reminded that he&#39;s not missing much in <br/>\nschool. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea how you might communicate that to your children or if you need <br/>\nto . . . but it reminded me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 12/4/2003 8:53:15 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\nI worry so much about Sarah (or the other children) coming to me later on in <br/>\nlife and saying that they totally regret not having had 1) the public school <br/>\nexperience &quot;everyone else&quot; did or 2) that they really wish I&#39;d taught them a, <br/>\nb, or c ... sigh! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85658,"nextTopicId":85634}}
