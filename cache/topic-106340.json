By that, in the <br/>\ncontext I can no longer remember, it seemed she meant that Kirby should have no <br/>\nchoice about school, was too young to want to homeschool, hadn&#39;t been to <br/>\nschool so it wasn&#39;t fair for him to reject it, so it was MY decision, made <br/>\nselfishly so I wouldn&#39;t have to go back to work (MAYBE that was her thought, as she <br/>\nalways whined about working as a teacher).  I had two younger kids, though.   I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t fixin&#39; to go anywhere.  Her emotion when she made the accusation was <br/>\npalpable, though.  She was full on indignantly angry, and already at the door, <br/>\nleaving my house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it can be selfish, possibly.  Someone on AlwaysLearning was <br/>\ndescribing the three kinds of homeschoolers in her area (Durham in NE England), and <br/>\nafter describing &quot;quality of education&quot; home educators and religous home <br/>\neducators, she described a third group, and I&#39;d consider this somewhat selfish  (she <br/>\nadmits it&#39;s a generality and somewhat bitter, but I&#39;ve known some of these <br/>\nfamiles from LLL, where it wasn&#39;t about the baby, it was about the mom&#39;s coolness <br/>\nratings):<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-The third type is the truly alternative type.  The people who are<br/>\n<br/>\nchoosing to home-educate because it fits in with their lifestyle<br/>\n<br/>\nchoices.  They have nutritionists and holistic therapists and are<br/>\n<br/>\nvegan, or wish they had the dedication to be, and insist that their<br/>\n<br/>\nchildren be vegan as well.  They have conversations about what kind of<br/>\n<br/>\nblood type diet they should be on. As parents the key educational<br/>\n<br/>\nlesson they seem to want to give is that sharing is the most important<br/>\n<br/>\nthing.  If any item is in question they will give it to someone not<br/>\n<br/>\ntheir child as it is more important that they teach their child to<br/>\n<br/>\ndefer their own needs to someone else&#39;s than that they (the parent)<br/>\n<br/>\ntake the time to help the other child or their own to come up with a<br/>\n<br/>\ncompromise or some alternative play.  In my experience the children<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom these backgrounds are less socially adept, less sure of<br/>\n<br/>\nthemselves.  If they get something that they really enjoy they hide it<br/>\n<br/>\nand fight for it and hope that the argument stays quiet enough that<br/>\n<br/>\ntheir parents don&#39;t notice and take away the coveted item.  There is<br/>\n<br/>\negotism to this kind of home-education that the other two don&#39;t seem<br/>\n<br/>\nto have as much of, a sense that home-education was less about helping<br/>\n<br/>\ntheir child and more about adding to their alternative legitimacy,<br/>\n<br/>\nlike a tattoo or a tongue stud or whatever.  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106271,"nextTopicId":106393}}
