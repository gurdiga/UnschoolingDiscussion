This is exactly the kind of<br/>\nthing I was wondering about. I have *felt* that this would be the case<br/>\nif unschooling was embraced fully, but I guess I have needed some<br/>\nreal-life examples to reassure me. The college question is one that<br/>\nhas come up in discussions with my husband about unschooling. (After<br/>\nreading about some other husbands on this list, I feel so lucky that<br/>\nhe is *far* from reluctant about the issue--we have been researching<br/>\nit together and he is very pro-unschooling.) I have a feeling that<br/>\nmany of our extended family members will bring that one up, too, since<br/>\nhigher education is a big priority in our families. I really<br/>\nappreciate you sharing your experience with me--I think it will help<br/>\nto offer &quot;testimonials&quot; like this to skeptical relatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\n<br/>\nTarasine </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2357","postDate":"1031710653","msgId":43673,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMzZwTGNFY0xzWEpCN29EYVMwMDAwMDgyMUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43669,"nextInTopic":43722,"prevInTime":43672,"nextInTime":43674,"topicId":43669,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I<br/>\n&gt; mean, I realize that an unschooling parent wouldn&#39;t coerce/push/bribe<br/>\n&gt; (as in Sandra&#39;s humorous example) a child to attend college, or even<br/>\n&gt; assume that college is a given for their child. But do children who<br/>\n&gt; have been unschooled feel a need or desire for college? Do those who<br/>\n&gt; decide on college need to do some preparation to &quot;get them ready&quot; for<br/>\n&gt; the schoolish way of doing things (e.g. exams, papers, lectures,<br/>\n&gt; etc.)? What has been your experience?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can give you our current experience with our unschooled kids:<br/>\n<br/>\nI teach part-time at a local community college and my kids have hung out at <br/>\ncolleges for their whole lives - we go to concerts and theater events there, <br/>\netc. So - it was very natural for them to want to do things there, too. My <br/>\noldest signed up for a voice class and a piano class when she was 13, almost <br/>\n14. She loved it. The next semester she was invited to sing in a jazz singing <br/>\ngroup and she took a psychology class and ceramics. After that she took <br/>\nspeech and got onto the forensics team and competed in debate tournaments, <br/>\netc. She took photography and had some large mural portraits displayed in a <br/>\nstudent show in a gallery in Laguna Beach (artsy-fartsiest place in Southern <br/>\nCalifornia &lt;G&gt;). She is now in her fifth year of taking classes there - she&#39;s <br/>\ntaken academic courses like history and math and composition and she&#39;s taken <br/>\nlots of fine arts classes and she&#39;s had a blast, but she&#39;s now very restless. <br/>\nShe wants to move on to something &quot;more&quot; - but can&#39;t decide what. She has an <br/>\nurge to &quot;just travel&quot; for some months - wants to visit all her unschooling <br/>\nfriends all over the US and Canada. Sometimes she wants to transfer to a <br/>\nuniversity. I&#39;m not sure what she&#39;ll end up doing. She also has a 30+ hours <br/>\nper week job that she absolutely loves - at Laguna Clay Company which is a <br/>\nvery large manufacturer of glazes and clays and pottery equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has very high grades, nearly all A&#39;s, and has had absolutely no trouble <br/>\nat all in adjusting to taking classes and studying and taking exams, etc. It <br/>\nis easy for her. She&#39;s also had no trouble adjusting to working - she&#39;s <br/>\nresponsible and a very-much-valued employee.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut - now - here she is at almost-18 and taking ceramics, print-making, and a <br/>\nmath class and I think she&#39;s burned out on school and needs time off and away <br/>\nfrom it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second child is following the same path -- but is into music and theater <br/>\nas well as computer programming. She&#39;s almost 15. No problems with handling <br/>\nthe college classes -- high grades and is enjoying it a LOT.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\nThe National Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43582,"nextTopicId":43735}}
