I have no clue as to why this all started and think the carrying on of<br/>\na few now, mostly over there, is just annoying and senseless.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, I think, and take that for what&#39;s it&#39;s worth, the name calling for at<br/>\nleast one person, stems from some stuff awhile ago. I do remember someone<br/>\nsaying that if that&#39;s what you think then you must be as a dumb as a brick.<br/>\nDidn&#39;t quote here as I&#39;m going on memory only. I do also remember possibly<br/>\none or two other times that something similar has been said. There have been<br/>\n*ifs* and *must* and *maybe&#39;s* used and never anyone that I recall saying<br/>\n&quot;blank you are as dumb as a brick.&quot; So actual name calling to a person I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t seen. Some have gotten annoyed and made statements that probably<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have been posted. I include myself in on that one. I do think that<br/>\nwhen one poster in particular is riling up the rest, it is better after<br/>\nseeing that they are not going to at least listen, to just not post at all.<br/>\nThat for some people though is easier said that done. I understand that, I<br/>\nthink most her do too. I&#39;ve gotten upset on this list a couple of times but<br/>\njust don&#39;t take it personally. Because of how I am, I have a hard time not<br/>\nseeing how others can not take it personally either. That&#39;s something I just<br/>\ncan&#39;t understand and get annoyed with. There was once on this list and now<br/>\non the RUL where I just really want to post &quot;why don&#39;t you just shut the<br/>\nf*** up!&quot; It&#39;s stupid. But I don&#39;t post that and just delete instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn nutshell I don&#39;s see what all the crap is about. I understand how some at<br/>\nfirst feel stepped on, but not giving any time to really look at the<br/>\nsituation and spouting off instead just isn&#39;t right. If some people that<br/>\ncome to this list have a hard time feeling like some think of themselves as<br/>\ngod like (my words here) then I feel like that&#39;s their problem. If someone<br/>\nwants to feel like a know it all, it doesn&#39;t make it so. If someone else<br/>\nbelieves it, it still doesn&#39;t make it so.
