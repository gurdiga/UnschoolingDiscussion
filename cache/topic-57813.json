When I first thought about homeschooling, it was just second nature for me to think &quot;school at home&quot; and dive into an overwhelming amount of curricula choices. The first book I read was &quot;The Well Trained Mind&quot;. This gave me the structure/plan that I needed at the time, but I wish I would have explored other philosophies first. I was always curious about unschooling, and I couldn&#39;t comprehend what exactly it was. I finally looked more into it when the curriculum just wasn&#39;t working.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo make a short story long:)...maybe you can nicely try to stress to her to explore several education philosophies before settling with one or even with a curriculum.

What I will do,<br/>\nwhen in a group of people who are all offering up their advice, is just<br/>\ngive the person my phone number and an open invite to call me if they<br/>\nhave any questions, or to come see how our days go. A lot of times seeing<br/>\nis believing. I have lent out books before, but I have too often asked<br/>\nthe people what they thought of them only to be told that after having<br/>\nthe books for months, they were never read. I do like to keep a list of<br/>\nfavorite books (of which the Unschooling Handbook is number one) and if<br/>\nanybody asks, I offer up the list. That way, if they are really<br/>\ninterested, they will take the initiative to search them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of weeks ago I got a call from my 60 year old aunt. She has a<br/>\nten year old daughter who they adopted from somewhere in South America at<br/>\n3. The child has a lot of issues caused by her mental and physical abuse<br/>\nas a toddler, and these issues are causing her problems in school. My<br/>\naunt wanted advice on homeschooling, but apparently had spoke to some<br/>\nother school-at-homers before contacting me. She wanted to know things<br/>\nlike curriculum, how we set up &quot;school&quot;, schedules, etc.etc. I told her<br/>\nwe don&#39;t, on all accounts. I suggested that maybe &quot;school&quot; itself was<br/>\npart of her daughter&#39;s problem, and that maybe if she could just do lots<br/>\nof fun things and just start to enjoy life , it would help her mental and<br/>\nphysical being. My aunt just said, yea, but that isn&#39;t teaching her<br/>\nanything. I said, neither is school (maybe I shouldn&#39;t have). She was<br/>\npolite, but you could just tell she wasn&#39;t interested, and didn&#39;t want<br/>\nany book recommendations. We&#39;ll see how it pans out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWende<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] How to handle new homeschooler situation","postDate":"1044403349","msgId":57825,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyZS4yMjIyM2NiYi4yYjcxYWU5NUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57824,"nextInTopic":57827,"prevInTime":57824,"nextInTime":57826,"topicId":57813,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/4/2003 6:46:44 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

I sat for a while and listened <br/>\n  as a few of the other moms told her how to juggle the different curriculums <br/>\n  of different grade levels of children.  How to keep records, how to record <br/>\n  tests and grade.  They talked about report cards etc etc and mentioned that <br/>\n  at 7 you have to send in you notice of intent to homeschool to the state etc. <br/>\n  I wasn&#39;t sure how to offer alternative ideas without sounding pushy.  She <br/>\n  does know we unschool and that we are the only ones there.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I just kind of butted in when they were talking about record keeping for the <br/>\n  state and said the only record you need to keep on a daily basis is <br/>\n  attendance record.  Also immunization record or statement of faith exclusion. <br/>\n  I wasn&#39;t sure how to say anything without being pushy myself.  Thought I <br/>\n  might lend her my copy of The Unschooling Handbook and just explain that I <br/>\n  know she intends to use a curriculum (she did say that) but that I thought it <br/>\n  might help to read about another option just to get some perspective on <br/>\n  homeschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I hate to have someone start out so overwhelmed with curriculum and tests and <br/>\n  grades and report cards.  None of it is state required.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just not sure how to handle these situations without being confrontational.  <br/>\n  Maybe I did enough.  Some women are so &quot;school at home&quot; and get kind of pushy <br/>\n  when they feel they really know &quot;how to work it.&quot;  Any other thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Pam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
