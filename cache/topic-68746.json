We plan<br/>\non<br/>\ngoing every week until school lets out. Last time we went, Alyssa was<br/>\nnot<br/>\nhaving fun after a half hour. She loves the pool but not water slides<br/>\nand<br/>\nsprinklers and shallow water. She wanted to go home. The other 2 didn&#39;t.<br/>\nI<br/>\nmade up my mind that I would do whatever I had to so that everyone would<br/>\nend<br/>\nup happy. It ended up that I got in touch with my mom and she came to<br/>\npick<br/>\nup the baby. Alyssa was happy to leave and spend time at home with<br/>\ngrandma<br/>\nand the other two were happy to stay. Then after a couple of hours,<br/>\nSierra<br/>\nwanted to leave and Joseph didn&#39;t. So we made an agreement, Joseph would<br/>\ndecide this time when to leave and next time Sierra would decide. So<br/>\ntoday,<br/>\nJoseph wanted to leave first but also knew he agreed to the decision<br/>\nlast<br/>\ntime around. He knew Sierra stayed longer than she wanted to for him. So<br/>\nhe<br/>\nwalked around and then sat and played alone in the shade and then sat<br/>\nwith<br/>\nme and talked for awhile. He waited patiently for Sierra like she had<br/>\nthe<br/>\nweek before for him. I then said next time we would stay until closing<br/>\nbecause that&#39;s what I wanted to do. I know one of them, probably both<br/>\nwill<br/>\nenjoy that. But the decision is off both of them for that one. They both<br/>\nmentioned bringing their gameboys so that if one gets tired of water<br/>\nplay,<br/>\nthey still have something to do. And in all honesty, if both get tired,<br/>\nwe<br/>\nwould leave before closing. It&#39;s not like I really need to be there<br/>\nuntil<br/>\n5:00!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI must also mention now that the baby stays home when we go and has no<br/>\nproblem doing so. This all went very smoothly and certainly didn&#39;t take<br/>\njust<br/>\none time to get it that way. A lot of communicating from when they were<br/>\nlittle brings us to this time and problem solving now. They don&#39;t see it<br/>\nas<br/>\none &quot;having&quot; to stay but as cutting a deal with each other. A lot of<br/>\ndeals<br/>\ngo on here with them on a daily basis. They figure it out for themselves<br/>\nand<br/>\nit works well. Sometimes they need some help, most times they don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a last note, one mom that was going to meet us there today cancelled.<br/>\nShe<br/>\nwrote me late Sunday night that her 10 year old son did something and<br/>\nshe<br/>\ngrounded him for today. I can guarantee you that whatever he did had<br/>\nnothing<br/>\nto do with the impending day at the water park.

How is taking away a ball from a child for throwing it at <br/>\nsomone a reward?  What is being rewarded?  It is a logical consequence in a <br/>\npunishing frame of mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n***In the problem with the child that is behaving in a negative manner to<br/>\nthings that a family must do to survive and thrive.he is making the time<br/>\nfor his sibling to go to the park an unmanageable time for the entire<br/>\nfamily. An equal reversal and logical consequence would be that he<br/>\nforfeits HIS time that would be spent with a friend that day.***<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo wrongs don&#39;t make it right.  Especially for the child.  In this case, he <br/>\nis being rewarded for his negative behavior.  It creates the possibility of <br/>\nan endless cycle.....He makes life miserable for the family, so Mom or Dad <br/>\nmakes his life miserable.  Well, next time he&#39;ll make SURE he is even worse <br/>\nto get you back.  I&#39;ve been there.  I have seven children.  It happens.  <br/>\nWhen children need attention and cannot find positive ways to get it, they <br/>\nwill seek out negative behaviors that are &quot;rewarded&quot; with increased <br/>\nattention.  Even if it is negative.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I still do not see this as a punishment.he used his brother&#39;s time to go <br/>\nto the<br/>\nplay date by being negative and ugly. So in exchange for mom spending<br/>\nthe effort to let him engage in his play date, he needs to forfeit it.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not following the logic in this.  Isn&#39;t the desired result a happy, <br/>\ntrusting child???  Or is it a mother who &#39;got even&#39;??<br/>\n<br/>\n***I would have thought that all the things suggested by you below would<br/>\nhave already been done.the mother already said, &quot;Lately it seems like<br/>\nI&#39;m spending a lot of time making things that have to be done fun for<br/>\nhim.&quot;  I took this to mean she had already tried the negotiating of<br/>\nterms of play (your suggestion) and the well, find something to take<br/>\nwith you, and the other logical things. If she did and the son was still<br/>\nrebuking going, at what point to you make him accountable for his<br/>\nfeelings and acting out about them? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own experience, a child who does not respond to the suggestions I <br/>\nmentioned is a child who *needs* positive attention, patience and <br/>\nunderstanding.  Children *want* to please their parents and be happy.  At <br/>\nthat point, I would be looking at *my* past and present behaviors and how <br/>\nthey are affecting my child.  I would look for inconsistancy and negativity <br/>\nin my actions.  Am I acting in peaceful trusting and loving ways, or am I <br/>\nexpecting and modeling negative, distrusting, and unloving behaviors.  It&#39;s <br/>\nnot an easy thing to confront but it often reveals so much if we are open <br/>\nand honest with ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] bad mommy moment","postDate":"1052795182","msgId":68803,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkZC45ODhmZGFkLjJiZjFiYjJlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":68802,"nextInTopic":68804,"prevInTime":68802,"nextInTime":68804,"topicId":68746,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/12/03 8:40:30 PM, gtvaldez@charter.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1893918385\">In a message dated 5/12/03 8:40:30 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gtvaldez@...\">gtvaldez@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Please don&#39;t be so defensive without<br/>\nasking first the literal meaning behind the language. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t need to ask the literal meaning behind English.

I have raised my children with<br/>\nthe thought process that every action we take, there is an equal and<br/>\nopposite reaction. Negative choices are rewarded with negative<br/>\nconsequences. Not punishment but logical consequences. <br/>\n <br/>\nIn the problem with the child that is behaving in a negative manner to<br/>\nthings that a family must do to survive and thrive.he is making the time<br/>\nfor his sibling to go to the park an unmanageable time for the entire<br/>\nfamily. An equal reversal and logical consequence would be that he<br/>\nforfeits HIS time that would be spent with a friend that day. I still do<br/>\nnot see this as a punishment.he used his brother&#39;s time to go to the<br/>\nplay date by being negative and ugly. So in exchange for mom spending<br/>\nthe effort to let him engage in his play date, he needs to forfeit it.<br/>\n <br/>\nI would have thought that all the things suggested by you below would<br/>\nhave already been done.the mother already said, &quot;Lately it seems like<br/>\nI&#39;m spending a lot of time making things that have to be done fun for<br/>\nhim.&quot;  I took this to mean she had already tried the negotiating of<br/>\nterms of play (your suggestion) and the well, find something to take<br/>\nwith you, and the other logical things. If she did and the son was still<br/>\nrebuking going, at what point to you make him accountable for his<br/>\nfeelings and acting out about them? <br/>\n <br/>\nI do want to apologize as I reread the original message - I<br/>\nmisunderstood her statement regarding the sending him to public school<br/>\nnext year part. I read it as though she THOUGHT it and when I reread it<br/>\njust now, I read it correctly. I would address this as being most<br/>\nprofusely apologetic and explaining how frustrated you were as a mom<br/>\nneeding to balance the needs of her kids and meeting the stress point of<br/>\nhis choice to act up about going. Discussing how his choice to<br/>\nmisbehaves makes it difficult for you to meet his little brothers need<br/>\nto socialize and you might even ask him some thoughts on how it could be<br/>\nmade better next time so that he might enjoy the time better. I<br/>\nNATURALLY would have assumed that one would have tried to find the cause<br/>\nfor such behavior. I personally rarely need to delve into the mind of my<br/>\n4 year old to get him to talk about his needs that aren&#39;t being met. I<br/>\nAM NOT WITH EXPERIENCE in the older child&#39;s needs and frustrations yet<br/>\nso I can only offer what I think I would do. But being an experienced<br/>\nchildcare provider for 12 years of in home care.I kept many children for<br/>\n5-10 years each.that is what I would do.<br/>\n <br/>\nHope I didn&#39;t offend anyone - I still am a believer in consequences of<br/>\nactions.

Honestly, if the<br/>\nball <br/>\nis taken away, he doesn&#39;t have the chance to play with it, properly or<br/>\nnot.  <br/>\nYou might try showing him how to play with the ball without harming<br/>\nothers <br/>\nand if he is angry, looking at the reasoning behind his anger and<br/>\naddressing <br/>\nthat.  Hitting you with a ball is either an accident or a display of <br/>\nemotion.

Offer to play with HIM while his brother or sister plays with the<br/>\n<br/>\nother kids.  I might also offer to do something of his choosing before<br/>\nor <br/>\nafter the playdate so everyone has the chance to do something they want<br/>\nto <br/>\ndo.  He is more likely to be accomodating of the playdate if he knows he<br/>\ncan <br/>\nchoose something HE likes to do before or after.  If his emotions behind<br/>\nhis <br/>\nactions are addressed and acknowledged and alternatives suggested he has<br/>\nthe <br/>\nability to learn problem solving and *trusts* that you are with him, not<br/>\n<br/>\nagainst him.

If you offer a safe alternative to his reason <br/>\nfor throwing the ball and model safe ball throwing for him and with him, his <br/>\nreward is learning that he can learn peaceful outlets for his emotions and <br/>\nsafe ball playing while still feeling peace with mom.

There are other possibilities.  <br/>\nOne being that he is told that hitting people is not a way to keep friends.  <br/>\nI&#39;d discuss the reason he chose to hit, if possible in front of his friend, <br/>\nand ask if he might think of another way to solve the problem so they can <br/>\nget back to being friendly.

Honestly, if the ball <br/>\nis taken away, he doesn&#39;t have the chance to play with it, properly or not.  <br/>\nYou might try showing him how to play with the ball without harming others <br/>\nand if he is angry, looking at the reasoning behind his anger and addressing <br/>\nthat.

They rarely ever <br/>\ndo.  Why not offer him something to take along to the park to keep himself <br/>\nbusy?  Offer to play with HIM while his brother or sister plays with the <br/>\nother kids.  I might also offer to do something of his choosing before or <br/>\nafter the playdate so everyone has the chance to do something they want to <br/>\ndo.  He is more likely to be accomodating of the playdate if he knows he can <br/>\nchoose something HE likes to do before or after.  If his emotions behind his <br/>\nactions are addressed and acknowledged and alternatives suggested he has the <br/>\nability to learn problem solving and *trusts* that you are with him, not <br/>\nagainst him.  He may not like the option still, but at least he can now <br/>\ntrust that Mom cares about his needs and wants and will try to accomodate <br/>\nhim while still following through with the task at hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n***And what exactly would the unschooling parent do to a willfully<br/>\nmisbehaving child?***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis unschooling mom would do all of the above while loving, listening, <br/>\naccomodating when possible or offering something desireable afterwards as an <br/>\nalternative and never forget HUMOR!

He is a kid that<br/>\nis learning to push buttons because of his disappointment in the<br/>\nsituation at hand. Simply fact of the matter is sometimes we all have to<br/>\ndo errands we don&#39;t want to do. When we do, we can pout, be nasty to<br/>\nothers, or make the most of it by taking along a different activity to<br/>\noccupy ourselves with. If we are nasty, that choice of behavior earns no<br/>\npriviledges of anything later he wants to do. If he pouts, ten as long<br/>\nas he isn&#39;t nasty, he is just making his time there miserable for<br/>\nhimself. But if he chooses to be occupied by a book, game or other<br/>\nmanipulative or toy, then he earns the priviledge of doing an activity<br/>\nhe chooses at a more convientent or appropriate time. This is called<br/>\nfamily.and it gets hectic and unbearable at times. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe choice of his behavior is his to make - the consequences of his<br/>\nchoices need to be clear and absolute and most consistent. Choose to be<br/>\nugly = lose preiviledges, choose to be polite = earns rewards or extra<br/>\npriviledges.
