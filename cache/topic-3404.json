When the topic first came <br/>\nup, my first thought was of all the money I would be spending. With 5 kids, <br/>\nit can really add up fast. Over the years I have gotten really sick and <br/>\ntired of worrying about there being enough presents and if everyone has what <br/>\nthey really want, and if each is getting the same number of gifts, and all <br/>\nthe crap that goes with Christmas.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did it to myself. When my oldest, Megan, was 3 she asked for 3 things from <br/>\nSanta. I got her those 3, and several more. She looked at all that, and said <br/>\n&quot;Mommy I only asked for 3 things, why did I get so many?&quot; I realized then <br/>\nthat I blew it. I should have stuck to the list. Instead I passed on the <br/>\ntradition of excess from my own childhood. At the time, I still wanted <br/>\nthat-the tree overflowing with presents, the excitement, and it was fun <br/>\nwhile the kids were little. They were thrilled with everything they got, <br/>\nwhether it was something expensive or just a little thing. Now I think that <br/>\nSanta presents are the big ticket items that they know I won&#39;t buy but they <br/>\ncan get from him for free.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to come clean on it and tell them that there is no Santa, but <br/>\nthen I remember telling Meg. She had said one day in the car that even <br/>\nthough other kids say there is no Santa, she knew I would never lie to her. <br/>\nI thought it was a big hint to go ahead and tell her, so one day when we <br/>\nwere alone, I did. She was totally horrified. She cried, I felt awful. I do <br/>\nnot ever want to go through that again. So, on we go. If I had it to do over <br/>\nagain, Oh, tough one. I still love that magic-I always want to believe in <br/>\nfairy tales, and Santa is such a good one. I guess that I would like it if <br/>\nSanta only brought some little things-the ones made by elves and not <br/>\nNintendo or Mattel. Then the big dollar toys would still be subject to <br/>\nreality. Wow, that is a good idea-wonder if I could start some kind of <br/>\npropaganda that Santa is going back to basics and making all his own stuff <br/>\nagain!! Do you think the kids would buy it?<br/>\n<br/>\nCathie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Nicole Brown &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nbrown@...\">nbrown@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Christmas<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 25 Sep 2000 21:56:37 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just curious as to how everyone handles the Santa Claus thing?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I myself am a confirmed Grinch; Christmas is a huge annoyance to me and<br/>\n&gt;I resent being assaulted by that horrid music all season long (yes, I<br/>\n&gt;realize there is GOOD Xmas music, but they play the horrible stuff in<br/>\n&gt;the stores and at work...).

I was putting her shoes on and talking about &quot;the spirit of Christmas&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;St Nicholas&quot;, etc, everything except actually saying &quot;Santa&#39;s not<br/>\nreal&quot;...I finally stop, and Cristina says, &quot;You&#39;re putting me on.&quot;  I<br/>\nconsider for a second and agree. She eventually figured it out. And we&#39;ve<br/>\nnever had a problem with Santa being on the same level as God.

I&#39;m sure they know at a young age that the characters are not<br/>\nreal, yet they adore them. It&#39;s magical. When I asked my mom if there was a<br/>\nsanta she said &quot;Santa is whoever you want him to be.&quot; To this day these<br/>\nwords ring true with me. I even have a sweatshirt that says &quot;I still believe<br/>\nin Santa Claus&quot; and I&#39;m 31 years old. It seems to me that Christmas would be<br/>\nlacking with out santa.

We did<br/>\nthe 24th with mine and 25th with his and every other year Thanksgiving<br/>\nstuff.  Then we moved 250 miles away, far enough that we prefer to stay a<br/>\nnight or two when we visit and the trip involves a mountain pass that<br/>\ngets plenty of snow in winter.  So we stay home (& invite all our family<br/>\nto come and spend holidays with us, so far no takers)<br/>\nThis will be our 4th Christmas here.  With my family of origin, we<br/>\ndecided a few years ago not to exchange gifts, except between Grandma &<br/>\nthe kids.  We broached this idea with Dh family, but they all continue to<br/>\ngive us gifts every year.  Last year we put together baskets with<br/>\nhomemade jam & dried fruits & a bottle of local wine.  Then I was annoyed<br/>\nbc I did most of the work on this and decided to make one for my sibs as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\nLet me add that we are on a TIGHT budget and dh went out & bought fancy<br/>\nbaskets (I would have been content to just put stuff in a bag, but he is<br/>\ngenerous and thoughtful and likes to do nice things for people).  So,<br/>\nthere was less money to buy stuff for our kids.  Not that I wanted to<br/>\nspend a lot on my kids, just that we had no money and were spending<br/>\ngiving things to grown-up siblings who are mostly financially better off<br/>\nthan we are.<br/>\nThis is part of my gripe with the whole gift thing.  I will quote from my<br/>\nbrother: &quot;Why spend money I don&#39;t have trying to pick out a gift for<br/>\n(relative) who doesn&#39;t really &quot;need&quot; anything anyway, & they are doing<br/>\nthe same for me&quot;  Why not instead use our money to choose things we&#39;ve<br/>\ndecided we need or want for ourselves?  Or to give to charity?  Or to not<br/>\nspend at all and get the whole Christmas thing away from tons of gifts<br/>\nanyway!<br/>\nI also like the idea someone said about sending gifts when you want to<br/>\n(rather than special occasions only).  I digressed quite a bit there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;What do you do for Christmas? We are right now trying to implement a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>new way <br/>\nof doing Christmas. This is when our children look like they just bought<br/>\nToys <br/>\nR Us! We decided that since Christ was given 3 gifts, we will give 3<br/>\ngifts, <br/>\nand then we will focus on clothing and needed items. In stockings my<br/>\nchildren <br/>\nare always blessed with undergarments, pencils, and other little goodies.<br/>\nI <br/>\nthink that this year we are going to tone down the big toy hype and focus<br/>\non <br/>\nfamily and Christ. We have also decided that instead of shopping for high<br/>\n<br/>\npriced gifts for family and friends, we will make bread, soup mixes,<br/>\ncookies, <br/>\nand hot chocolate<br/>\nStephanie<br/>\nMommy to Tiffany, Martin, James, and Stacie&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m all in favor of edible gifts!<br/>\nThe art of teaching is the art of assisting discovery.<br/>\nMary Ellen-<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>\nTry Juno Web: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"megates@xxxx.xxx","from":"megates@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"7nlwkBAwSaGR4elTThN7sBvIZR7xsijJ8WZEsTuzWMs8npBMzXhYjLyBxCQY7ZPIe9Oh1yWZXQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Christmas","postDate":"938567807","msgId":3404,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMzEuMzQwNC45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3422,"prevInTime":3403,"nextInTime":3405,"topicId":3404,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... family gatheringsgourmet meals & fancy clothes i The art of teaching is the art of assisting discovery.
