I think its helpful for people to see how a transformation can take place.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour transformation/experience in &quot;getting&quot; unschooling is similar to mine.   I read and read and read, oh did I say that I read?  &lt;g&gt;   It just clicked.  Made soo much sense to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n**What got me to this <br/>\nplace was that there were people way out ahead of me - shining a light <br/>\nand beckoning and giving me real clear no-nonsense uncluttered <br/>\ndirection.**   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that light was shining brightly for me also!  Right here at unschooling.com and Sandra&#39;s web site.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then,,instead of sitting and thinking about these &quot;dangerous thoughts&quot;---  I just jumped in,  head first,  no looking back.  Which sometimes can be quite a shock for some..my dh especially.    I look back now and wonder if I was too impulsive,  too brash?    <br/>\n<br/>\nNahhhh,  I did my research, my reading and you know what?  In my  heart I knew  that I was doing the right thing.  How could it be wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have loved the change,  its been over a year now and I&#39;m so glad that it wasn&#39;t a shock to them.   I know others have said that some kids have had a hard time with the change.   Mine have not.   Maybe its an age thing,  mine are still quite young, 10, 8 and 6.  Maybe its a personality thing.   Maybe we rode the tide of change together, so it was OK.   We talk alot,  maybe that&#39;s it?   I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess to me as long as we listen to our children and figure out what they need and like,  it can&#39;t be bad.   If a child wants some structure, we can help them find it.  If a child wants freedom its there.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIts interesting the way change takes place in peoples lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your post!<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Pamela Sorooshian <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, July 01, 2003 1:16 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Re: List Changes and Additions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  On Tuesday, July 1, 2003, at 06:35 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grlynbl@...\">grlynbl@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; No, I only asked because.. well, I think I stated the reasons I asked <br/>\n  &gt; in my<br/>\n  &gt; original post.

Although I&#39;d been enamored <br/>\n  of Summerhill and the free school movement way back in the late 60&#39;s, I <br/>\n  first read about unschooling on the AOL message boards. I was a quick <br/>\n  study - the minute I read the first few posts I was hooked and I <br/>\n  immediately ordered every back issue of Growing Without Schooling - and <br/>\n  read every one of John Holt&#39;s books and reread Summerville (having read <br/>\n  it as a college student) and so on. I was thrilled with the whole <br/>\n  concept of unschooling. Still, I had hang-ups. I was very very <br/>\n  &quot;well-schooled&quot; and it was scary to think of not guiding my children <br/>\n  along that same path of straight &quot;A&#39;s&quot; and honor societies and teacher <br/>\n  recommendations, etc. My own self-esteem was very wrapped up in my <br/>\n  school successes and degrees and professional life and I was afraid not <br/>\n  to push my children in that same direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I asked a lot of questions. I got a lot of answers that varied from <br/>\n  &quot;take it one step at a time&quot; to &quot;you can&#39;t unschool part time, it is <br/>\n  all or nothing.&quot; I confess I got a THRILL from the radical unschooling <br/>\n  answers. The more firm and blunt and clear, the better. I absolutely <br/>\n  needed the uncluttered-with-caveats and apology-free absolutist kinds <br/>\n  of statements that I heard from a number of people, but most especially <br/>\n  from Sandra. Anything less than that created more clutter in my <br/>\n  already-teeming brain. I was trying desperately to come to the most <br/>\n  important decision in my life (and, yes, that is how I DID think of <br/>\n  education - the MOST important decision) and I didn&#39;t need to be <br/>\n  coddled and I didn&#39;t want to hear watered-down ideas, I wanted straight <br/>\n  talk and nothing less. I skimmed over the posts that told me that <br/>\n  whatever worked for my family was what I should do. It was just a kind <br/>\n  of feel-good, everybody is okay, nonsense that said nothing and didn&#39;t <br/>\n  help me at all. I soon learned which posters would answer my questions <br/>\n  with concrete real solid-thinking advice and information and principles <br/>\n  and ideals and who would just say, &quot;Whatever&quot; (except, unfortunately, <br/>\n  they&#39;d say it at great length). I skipped the &quot;Whatevers&quot; and avidly <br/>\n  read (and reread) the hard-hitting stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then there was a conference scheduled in my neck of the woods (Los <br/>\n  Angeles area) and Sandra was going to speak at it. I bravely wrote to <br/>\n  her offlist and offered to pick her up at the airport and take her to <br/>\n  her hotel. She seemed a bit taken aback, but she let me do it and I got <br/>\n  to meet her and her family. We continued, over the years, to find ways <br/>\n  to meet in person and we have become good friends. The first time I <br/>\n  heard Sandra speak, she talked about &quot;thinking dangerous thoughts.&quot; <br/>\n  This was EXACTLY what I was struggling with. I had all these radical <br/>\n  scary dangerous ideas now filling my head and I was a bit paralyzed, <br/>\n  mentally, because I had some real decisions to make. Sandra said, &quot;If <br/>\n  you&#39;re really afraid, duct-tape yourself to a chair or get a spotter <br/>\n  and just sit there and think all the dangerous thoughts you want. When <br/>\n  you&#39;re done, you&#39;ll still be sitting in that chair and you can, if you <br/>\n  want to, get up and live your life as if none of those thoughts had <br/>\n  ever existed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was electrified. It hit me that I could just do it - just think as <br/>\n  radically and extremely as I could possibly manage - and that it didn&#39;t <br/>\n  mean I was stuck or that I had to actually DO anything. I just needed <br/>\n  to stop worrying and really open up and think. It changed my life. It <br/>\n  was absolutely the right thing for someone to say at absolutely the <br/>\n  right time. I thought, honestly, about what my schooling had really <br/>\n  done to me. I thought about how superficial my experience had been - <br/>\n  high school, college, and grad school. I thought about how unrewarding <br/>\n  my career really was, how I felt like I was doing nothing worthwhile, <br/>\n  just earning money. I thought about what I&#39;d been like as a toddler and <br/>\n  preschool-age kid - how learning had been so exciting and how I&#39;d been <br/>\n  so passionate and enthusiastic about everything. I thought about how <br/>\n  I&#39;d lost that and how that was really, ultimately, losing out on loving <br/>\n  life itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I literally sat, in a chair, and did nothing but urge myself on - <br/>\n  trying, on purpose, to think things that were difficult for me. (No, I <br/>\n  didn&#39;t duct-tape myself to the chair - I didn&#39;t need to, I got the <br/>\n  point.) If I started to feel uncomfortable about something I was <br/>\n  considering, I&#39;d force myself to think even more about it, not to shy <br/>\n  away from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am now as confident in unschooling as I am confident that I live in <br/>\n  California and have three daughters and a husband and am sitting here <br/>\n  typing on a nice new iBook. In other words, I have absolutely no doubts <br/>\n  about unschooling. Unschooling is as natural to me now as eating and <br/>\n  sleeping.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I didn&#39;t get to this place of confidence overnight. What got me to this <br/>\n  place was that there were people way out ahead of me - shining a light <br/>\n  and beckoning and giving me real clear no-nonsense uncluttered <br/>\n  direction. If they&#39;d met me where I was - we&#39;d all still be there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes, Sandra is now a dear friend of mine and I adore her and owe her <br/>\n  more than I&#39;ll ever be able to repay. There are also a lot of other <br/>\n  people who were down there at the end of the unschooling road urging me <br/>\n  on and some of you are here and remember me then and know how far I&#39;ve <br/>\n  come!  All the time I was devouring every word they wrote, there were <br/>\n  people nitpicking and criticizing their posting style and their tone <br/>\n  and saying they should be more gentle, etc. That they just kept going <br/>\n  and helping and were tireless in answering questions with infinite <br/>\n  patience and stamina and are STILL doing it today - is an amazing <br/>\n  testimony to their good-heartedness and, mostly, to how much they <br/>\n  deeply care about children. My kids are lucky that they know Sandra <br/>\n  and, believe me, they know that the magical life they lead is largely <br/>\n  due to her influence. They love her as much as I do. I hope that every <br/>\n  mom who is just starting out considering homeschooling gets as lucky as <br/>\n  I did and finds their path lit as brightly as mine was.<br/>\n<br/>\n  pam sorooshian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
