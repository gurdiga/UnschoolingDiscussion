There are those who see tv as having so much power that <br/>\nthey truly think it is addicting and that the child loses the ability <br/>\nto make choices regarding it.

I understand the visual, too, <br/>\nof slack-jawed children staring blankly, unmoving, at the flickering <br/>\nscreen at tv shows with seemingly little valuable content.  I get it. I <br/>\nunderstand the fear and the annoyance and the worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat got me past seeing all that, to seeing a somewhat different <br/>\nvisual, was trying to be a realist. Seriously. I wanted my kids to have <br/>\nself-control and I realized that, realistically, if I did the <br/>\ncontrolling for them that they were not practicing self-control.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I had to look straight at that question and try to answer it: &quot;How <br/>\nwere they going to learn to live in a tv-saturated culture and make <br/>\nreasonable choices for themselves that they were happy with if I <br/>\ncontrolled the tv for them and didn&#39;t give them the freedom to learn <br/>\nabout it in their own way.?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat idea turned out to be just a stepping-stone and I don&#39;t even think <br/>\nabout it that way at all anymore.

For goodness sake, I&#39;ve spent more time debating it (or rather, just sharing with folks how we do things around here than I do watching the silly thing- That right there is ridiculous.) <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, no it&#39;s not the televisions fault if my son and I sit infront of it. That&#39;s hardly the problem. And really, there is no problem when each of us has sat down and expressed their needs and wants to each other and discussed it through. My son and I have a written understanding as well. (He came up with that when he was reading about the Bill of Rights). He asked if we could each write the things down on pieces of paper that we each felt we needed for ourselves and what we would each like to see happening in the family/house. Some things were: Thursday night: Board Game Night. Other things were: Friday Lunches: Pizza, Then there was my need of two hours of quiet in the afternoon due to major headache from my illness and reading books before bed. (When we read books at night, he settles down. Son is Asperger&#39;s, panic disorder, OCD, ADHD and Tourettes). We have always read book before bed. He loves books before bed. Since I can remember my son has carried around books. Because of<br/>\n his Asperger&#39;s my son can tend to be quite different than other children. He didn&#39;t want toys as a child. He wanted radios, computers, mixers (sharp pointy things removed) telephones... but not to play with in the traditional sense, to take apart and build things from- we have some pretty dang cool looking robots in this house.) <br/>\n <br/>\nWell, we went through some horrible times. We lost several family members (close relations) within in few months period. It was so bewildering and life changing. We suddenly had no money. I mean, no money. It was actually quite terrifying. So, we had to make some hard choices... what do we give up in order to survive? TV was right at the top of the list. He was four going on five at the time. We found that going without TV was an adjustment, but we also found that it was really fun not having one. That was for us. Not saying anyone else has to do it because we do. <br/>\n <br/>\nAm I saying that the TV is the bringer of evil and the harbinger of death? No. When my sister got us cable and we started watching and watching and watching (new novelty after all those years) we really began to sit there instead of doing the things we once did with each other. After a while, that died down quite a bit. Anymore, it&#39;s only on for entertainment purposes and not all that often. We both usually choose a movie to watch over TV if we are going to turn it on at all. <br/>\n <br/>\nPaying 30 dollars a month for a product we barely ever use seems silly to me. It&#39;s silly to spend money needlessly when one doesn&#39;t have that much to spend. I would much rather use that 30 dollars (because on my birthday, the cable is discontinued because it was only a present from my sister for a year), for something else. But that&#39;s just me. I discussed it with my son. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen my son said he felt like he hadn&#39;t seen me all day or was missing me because he&#39;d watched too much TV (a choice I let him make) then he turned it off and left it off. We discussed what would happen when the cable wasn&#39;t here anymore. We discussed what that would mean for him and myself. Then we arrive at a decision. <br/>\n <br/>\nNow, I have to say something here. I think the most valuable discussion that seems to be an undercurrent to the one about this TV thing, is that what are we each doing? Does it influence our children? Do we send them messages about things? Do we help shape them or let them shape themselves? Okay... these are important. Very important issues here. Because... I don&#39;t believe for one moment a person just shapes themselves entirely out of nothing. A person learns to shape themselves by learning who they are on their own and testing themselves against what others think and feel and do. So... when a child shapes themselves, or even an adult, that person (whether child or adult) must come up against other ideas, rules, lifestyles, etc... to test themselves. To see if they have really given what they think and believe validity and can stick with it. To be able to define oneself this way is substantial. If a person (and I mean anyone) could live their lives however they wanted doing whatever<br/>\n they wanted, how ever they wanted, where would be the challenge? Where would be the test? And, I must say, I have been influenced by many people... my parents included. However, I also developed a very strong sense of self (which my son seems to have done as well in spades!)... so it didn&#39;t matter what those people said or did around me, even if it meant that for a time I had to do things a different way than what I wanted to. I still found a way to self satisfy and figure out how to do things for myself.<br/>\n <br/>\nI was brought up in a public school setting, as probably most of us have been. Even though I went through it like the cattle they treated us, I still had that flare and spark for individuality. I found ways to express it and found ways to become me. I think that (and I would never ever say that people should send their children to public schools... ick, yuck, hack bad, bad bad! but that&#39;s just my opinion- those places are grim and try to fit everyone into the same silly shape), I think that I am much more defined as the person I am because I was challenged so much as a child growing up. It fueled me. Do I believe my son should be challenged in this way? Heck no. But I believe my son is being challenged daily because he&#39;s learning to live with people and around people and compromising and finding that you don&#39;t always get your way, period. There are things that must be done, so put down that game and get to it. I need you to help with the laundry because I can&#39;t get down the steps<br/>\n today. Or I need you to help with the dishes because I can&#39;t hold them. Your cat needs to be fed and you will do it... sorry, turn off the tv there are things to be done. Does that make me a bad, overly controling Mom? I do not believe it does and I never will. I need that help. That&#39;s it. It&#39;s just he and I on a mostly daily basis. He&#39;s 12, he&#39;s able. I&#39;m sure he could learn laundry and cooking and cleaning and budgeting as an adult if he cared to, or even as an older child if he cared to. However, there is a need for it here right now. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen Mom has Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, Sjogren&#39;s Syndrome, etc... etc... etc..., she needs the help. Does that mean things have to be turned off. Yup. My son doesn&#39;t have a sense of time. He doesn&#39;t understand the passing of time until it&#39;s gone. He is always shocked when the day turns to evening and so much time has passed. He knows how to tell time, but he doesn&#39;t understand it&#39;s workings. From what I&#39;ve learned from my friends who also have children with my son&#39;s challenges, a lot of their children (not all) deal with the same thing. So... my son has no idea how much time he&#39;s really spent on a game or watched TV. The idea that things fit into half an hour slots continually seems confusing to him and it makes him angry because of it. So, I say, time&#39;s up, you&#39;ve been there for two hours, time to do something else &#39;cause Mom needs help. <br/>\n <br/>\nAs far as a TV being another window to the world... in some cases I believe you are correct. But over all, it&#39;s not like that for me.  That&#39;s my personal view. Whether my son would agree with that or not, I don&#39;t know, he&#39;s asleep. We came to an agreement over it for different reasons. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo, I think, really, the larger issue here, the bigger debate, would be whether we influence our children and their choices or not? I would have to say we do. Even if we don&#39;t mean to. I would say that children watch us and they make their choices based on a lot different things... but they watch us and they do learn from us and we definately learn from them. We learn soooooo much from them it&#39;s amazingly wonderful. Why isn&#39;t it equally wonderful to have that available for a child?<br/>\n <br/>\nBen Franklin, a major &quot;rebel&quot; and unschooled child, did learn things he did not want to learn nor have interest in... but then he used those things in a very positive way to do things he did want to do. That man had many positive people in his life who became an influence to him. Many of them were hard working people with very, very strong ideas, opinions and voices. He gravitated toward them because they represented learning experiences that would help him grow in the areas he felt were needed. When I read the autobiography of Ben Franklin I was deeply, deeply impressed (and I have to read it again, there was just so much in it) by his fierce sense of self, but his overwhelming sense of others. He kept his views, fine tuned them, even changed his life at points due to the influence of folks he found to be important and strong people in their values and opinions. His family life was sometimes very difficult, but he strived for what he felt was important to him and those things did<br/>\n influence him and caused him to think. I have read about other great unschooled minds who have done just the same. I think a little challenge is a danged good thing. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy son can fight against me and voice out his opinion when I have done something he feels is wrong. That&#39;s great and I welcome it. It means he&#39;s developing into his own man. How much more could a mother ask for? Does that mean I back down? No... because then he didn&#39;t develop into his own man inspite of someone else opposing him, he developed into someone who doesn&#39;t see that people have their own choices and demands on life as well. He&#39;s developed without challenge and opposition. And life, my friends, as we all very well know, is filled to the hilt with opposition. Sometimes, it&#39;s the stuff that gives it spice. It&#39;s the stuff that gives us the courage to fit for our selves, others and the right to be free. Not opression, that is different and horrendous. Oppression is the supression of all rights of an individual... and that is not what I&#39;m talking about. I&#39;m talking about people being the people they are because they developed around people being the people they are. He makes his<br/>\n own choices every day... and so do I, very independent of each other. We don&#39;t talk about those choices... just live them. Then, as a family, there are some things that must be done. That&#39;s it. And as a family, there is compromise and discussion, challenge and even arguements and the agreement to not agree.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s just my opinion, though. That is what I have tested and found to be true for myself and how I will live my life and I do wish for everything my son learns to be himself through all that people will do and say and feel around him. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t squash him when he tells me something is a load of _____, or that is totally not fair, or I have no idea why you do that, Mom... I&#39;ll never do that. Fine... that&#39;s great. That&#39;s what you need, kid... and you&#39;ll go far! Speak your mind and live by your own set of values and beliefs, no matter what. That&#39;s the spice of life. <br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nSusan <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\nIn a message dated 2/16/2005 8:57:47 PM Eastern Standard Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Those games ARE part of his life.
