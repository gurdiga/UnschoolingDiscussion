My kids<br/>\nlove to tease me (now that they&#39;re 19 and 16, respectively) about how I may<br/>\nhave never spanked or grounded them, but I punished them inhumanely,<br/>\nnonetheless, by talking them to death.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I kept the discussions short, sweet, to the point -- which was to<br/>\nhelp them learn to talk to one another effectively and to work out the<br/>\nproblem on their own -- and ALWAYS followed it up directly with a hug and a<br/>\nkiss, no matter how mad I might have been when we started (although there<br/>\nmight have been some quiet, alone time at the begining to allow all parties<br/>\nto chill...)  My big thing was to teach the kids how to really listen to one<br/>\nanother, how to respect each others&#39; perspectives, etc.  We rarely talked<br/>\nfor longer than five or ten minutes, max, and that was only when they were<br/>\nquite a bit older.  I know it just seemd like forever to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway, that&#39;s their perception, and I can&#39;t convince them otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, a couple of months ago, Liam spent the weekend away with friends<br/>\nplaying D&D.  They were with one of the boys&#39; family at a retreat center of<br/>\nsome kind, and were more or less stuck with each other for the duration.<br/>\nFirst time they&#39;d tried this.  Sure enough, a disagreement broke out and<br/>\nsoon two of the boys weren&#39;t speaking to each other.  It was threatening the<br/>\nentire weekend, not to mention the continuity of the game.  &lt;gasp&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLiam, he just got around to telling me in this discussion recently, stayed<br/>\nout of it as long as he could, then finally intervened and said, &#39;Look, if<br/>\nyou guys can&#39;t get this settled, why don&#39;t you try something that used to wo<br/>\nrk for my sister and me.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nYep, you guessed it.  He put them in separate places until they&#39;d each<br/>\ncalmed down, then called them together and helped them to listen to one<br/>\nanother, speaking calmly, and behaving respectfully to one another.  The<br/>\nspat was settled quickly, and they enjoyed the rest of the weekend with no<br/>\nproblems.<br/>\n<br/>\nI punched Liam in the arm when he told me this story.  The little rat.

He used our family as <br/>\na &quot;See mom?  I have respectable friends&quot; when she came to visit.  We went over <br/>\nwith our cute little children and talked to her about respectable things, and <br/>\nbragged her son up to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was finishing a PhD in physics AND on the side for fun, getting a master&#39;s <br/>\ndegree in early English literature, studying Jacobean theatre mostly.   He <br/>\nbought a jeep and he bought a handgun, and used to go with friends to a target <br/>\nrange.  Never hunting, he didn&#39;t hike so he wouldn&#39;t even have shot a snake.  <br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t for self defense, even, it was target shooting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he went to visit his mom, the receipt fell out of his backpack (&quot;fell <br/>\nout of his backpack&quot; is the official pronouncement) and she found it.  Not the <br/>\ngun, that was in New Mexico. The receipt for the purchase of a gun.    <br/>\n<br/>\nHe was probably 28 at the time.  She freaked out totally.   Beyond all <br/>\nreasonable behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nResult?  He married someone from here and moved to Nevada, and if she wants <br/>\nto see him she can go to Nevada, knowing he has a jeep (she was also big on <br/>\nusing public transportation and not owning a vehicle, but she was also a lifelong <br/>\napartment dwelling resident of Manhattan) and a gun.    <br/>\n<br/>\nTheir relationship was built on him doing what she said and being a good <br/>\nstudent.

He rushed on, &quot;I know how you feel  about <br/>\nguns in the house, but I just want you to know that the Army says I can  have <br/>\none in addition to my weapon in Iraq. And Mandy&#39;s going to be living alone  <br/>\nthe whole time I&#39;m gone and she&#39;s going to keep it in the bedroom.  And  when I <br/>\nwas buying it I felt so *guilty* like I was betraying everything you  taught <br/>\nme.&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nI said, &quot;The better armed you are in Iraq, the happier I will be.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nHe was glad to hear it, and relieved.  And he went on to say how he  thought <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t really be upset because I know he&#39;s grown up now, but that he  <br/>\nstill felt guilty about it.  We talked a bit more, and he wanted to make  sure <br/>\nthat he knew if Will was around their house he&#39;d have to keep them locked  in the <br/>\ncontainer, and that sometimes when they come to our house they&#39;ll be in  the <br/>\ntrunk of the car, but that he&#39;d never bring it into my house.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHis father and I have been divorced since he was 4.  His father hunts  and <br/>\nhas lots of guns in the house.  Jake has grown up hunting and shooting  target <br/>\nwhenever he was with his dad.  I would often reiterate  about gun safety with <br/>\nhim and his brother, and I know their father did,  too.  I was in the Army <br/>\nNational Guard for 10 years, and I was trained to  shoot rifles and repair all <br/>\nkinds of weapons, but I still wouldn&#39;t have one in  my house.  I *never* would <br/>\nhave guessed that he&#39;d feel like he  &quot;betrayed&quot; me or guilty about buying a gun <br/>\nfor himself as a married adult  man.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI have to say that I felt incredibly honored that he took me into such  <br/>\nconsideration before making a decision about his very own life, but I didn&#39;t  <br/>\nexpect it at all.  I would have felt horible if he had considered how  I feel about <br/>\nit and then NOT bought the guns because of that.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI guess my point is that we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to sink  in with our <br/>\nkids.  The choices we make today and the things we  tell them can have long <br/>\nlasting effects, and they can be grown before  you know about it.   I say choose <br/>\nwisely how strongly to voice your  opinions about your kids&#39; choices.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: peace and love","postDate":"1091989190","msgId":97471,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQyLjEzNTUyOTU2LjJlNDdjOGM2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":97480,"prevInTime":97470,"nextInTime":97472,"topicId":97471,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/7/2004 11:32:48 PM Eastern Daylight Time, phunkymamaof2@yahoo.com writes: so what  if this kid eats only organic vegetarian, there is no","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-113951621\">In a message dated 8/7/2004 11:32:48 PM Eastern Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:phunkymamaof2@...\">phunkymamaof2@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nso what  if this kid eats only organic vegetarian, there is no way in <br/>\nthe world i  would let my kid eat your fast food!! lol there is no way <br/>\nmy kid would be  drinking a coke filled with all those chemicals <br/>\nsupporting a company that  kills their employees to keep them quiet <br/>\nand rules our  marketplace&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd when he&#39;s ten or 12 or 15 and DOES these things---eat fast food  and <br/>\ndrink a Coke----how will you treat him then?
