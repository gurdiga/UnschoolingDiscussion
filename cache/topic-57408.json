Attachment parenting with teens? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I lucked out, because we had the food freedoms and the bedtime freedoms  and <br/>\n  the TV freedoms before we knew we were going to homeschool.

And being methodical about <br/>\n  something which ultimately leads to the idea that children don&#39;t have to <br/>\n  learn methodically is not going to lead to that point very easily at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s okay if kids learn fractions before they can count to ten.<br/>\n  It&#39;s okay if a kid watches Shakespeare videos before he knows Tigger from <br/>\n  Eeyore.<br/>\n<br/>\n  How does that translate to &#39;getting unschooling&#39; for the parents though?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not sure. <br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s okay if parents leave all their house rules in place and JUST loosen the <br/>\n  &quot;learning&quot; rules and expectations.    &quot;Okay&quot; means they&#39;re still unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There have been a few vocal people over the past eleven years who have <br/>\n  totally balked at any suggestion that unschooling is a way of being.

You do it for what the kids have to <br/>\n  learn from the state, and you don&#39;t have to look at or change any other part <br/>\n  of your life.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I suppose that could be so.
