If there was a pet over population problem<br/>\nthey would be used for human food.<br/>\n<br/>\nPet over population is not a myth but if it makes your live easier to live<br/>\nin, well believe away to your heart&#39;s content.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, btw, there are folks that believe in your method of pet population<br/>\ncontrol.  The next time you are in the grocery store and pass by the pet<br/>\nfood section, check the ingredients listed on the labels of pet foods.<br/>\nANIMAL DIGEST is exactly what you say would be around if there were a<br/>\nproblem:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Many pet foods use condemned parts, carcasses rejected for human<br/>\nconsumption (rancid, moldy), and the so-called &quot;4D&quot; animals- diseased,<br/>\ndying, disabled or dead because they are obviously much cheaper. These meats<br/>\nare &quot;denatured&quot;, that is, sprayed with chemicals like kerosene to prevent<br/>\nthem from being sold as human grade. The pet foods are cooked at extremely<br/>\nhigh temperatures to &quot;sterilize&quot; these meats. Dogs and cats, euthanized<br/>\nusing sodium pentobarbital (which survives the rendering process and will<br/>\nstill be present in the food), as well as roadkill turn up under the generic<br/>\nnames of &quot;meat&quot;, &quot;meat meal&quot;. What is skimmed off in the cooking becomes<br/>\n&quot;animal fat&quot;. Always be cautious if the manufacturer is unwilling to<br/>\nspecifically name the protein or fat source. Look for human-grade protein<br/>\nsources to insure that your pet is not being fed cancerous tissue or meat<br/>\nfrom a sick animal riddled with drugs.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.greenworldpets.com/Evaluating%20Food.htm\">http://www.greenworldpets.com/Evaluating%20Food.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Dorinda Oakes&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Oakes_family_homeschool@...\">Oakes_family_homeschool@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 30, 2001 11:49 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Pet population myth?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I think this is a problem totally designed by the aspc and similar<br/>\norginizations to help them to<br/>\n&gt; aquire funds and control peoples lives.
