No matter what one says &quot;the system&quot; --<br/>\nschool, economic, business, media or what not -- will twist it to mean<br/>\nsomething else. Many have thaken the wore &quot;community&quot; in our book &quot;Creating<br/>\nLearning Communities&quot; to mean the local government.  Our concept, carefully<br/>\nexplained, was that any group of families who get together to do something<br/>\nis a community.  Homeschool support groups are communities, learning co-ops<br/>\nre communities, cooperative community life-long learning centers (CCL-LLCs)<br/>\nare communities.  Our thesis is that it easier and more efficient, if not<br/>\nnecessary, for each of us to rely on and help others.  That is &quot;community,&quot;<br/>\n&quot;neighborhood,&quot; &quot;village&quot; &quot;extended family&quot; as we see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as Lynda says (and a chapter by a Native American in the book says) that<br/>\nis the way all peoples have learned until the EuroAmericans changed it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nCollaborative Unschooling is the name of the game.  I&#39;m pleased to see so<br/>\nmuch of it on this listserv.<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n    THE PEOPLE ARE NOT THE PROBLEMS.

The whole &quot;it takes a village&quot; thing has been<br/>\n&gt; perverted and turned around.  It originally was used to mean the<br/>\n&gt; old-fashioned town where everyone knew everyone, you had an extended family<br/>\n&gt; close at hand and you didn&#39;t have to worry about your kids because even if<br/>\n&gt; you weren&#39;t there right at the moment that they needed you, you knew<br/>\n&gt; someone else would be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is very much the traditional Native American way of looking at children<br/>\n&gt; also.  And that sure isn&#39;t packing them off to brain-washing school each<br/>\n&gt; day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Politics, yuck, they ruin everything they touch or come near!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lynda </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12398,"nextTopicId":12364}}
