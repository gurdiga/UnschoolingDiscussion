We hav been homeschooling for a long time, but not<br/>\nunschooling.  Since we are transitioning into unschooling, she has told me<br/>\nthat she would like to do math, but does not like the book she was using,<br/>\nSingapore NEM1( Pre-Algebra and Algebra).  She said she would like to learn<br/>\nsome trigonometry and that she would really like to have some kind of<br/>\ncomputer, interactive thing from which she could learn about triangles.  Any<br/>\nidea?  I can&#39;t afford to spend a lot of money at this point, but want to<br/>\nhelp her find what interests her.  (Coming from a schooling philosophy, I<br/>\nhave no idea how she can do trig without first doing Algebra, but I am<br/>\ntrying to ignore myself on that one, lol).  I did check out a trig video<br/>\nfrom the library, can&#39;t think of what they are called at the moment.  She<br/>\nwatched some of it, but it didn&#39;t thrill her).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nerin in nd<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A child who picks up math from liking math workbooks is going to look very<br/>\n&gt; different from a child who picks up math by manipulating the numbers she<br/>\n&gt; encounters in real life.
