Not<br/>\n&gt; to play with but to rescue from not being owned. (There&#39;s a big TV size box<br/>\n&gt; overflowing with *just* cats and that&#39;s not counting the Beanies.) (And yes<br/>\n&gt; she has real cats, 2 kittens, and we&#39;re fostering a mom and 5 kittens for<br/>\n&gt; the shelter.) There&#39;s a Beanie Baby cat bought over the weekend that was<br/>\n&gt; carried around for a day and now sits abandoned on my computer desk.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If she were focused on one thing, that would be fine. There are 5 big boxes<br/>\n&gt; of stuffed animals. (Lots of handmedowns, gifts, yard sales so not all full<br/>\n&gt; priced.) Pokemon cards. Beanies. (I could go on.) She &quot;rescues&quot; pens run<br/>\n&gt; over by cars. (She says she loves living next to the high school because you<br/>\n&gt; can find so many pens! ;-) Rocks. Soda bottles. Bottle caps. (I could go on<br/>\n&gt; with this too.) She is mildly interested in collecting, as in gathering<br/>\n&gt; things together to admire their likenesses and differences, but right now<br/>\n&gt; the primary drive is just to get stuff into the house and away from being<br/>\n&gt; &quot;lost&quot; in the greater world.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (Probably a psychologist would have field day with this, thinking she was<br/>\n&gt; playing out feelings of fear of abandonment or something. But I do<br/>\n&gt; understand the feelings that prompt it because I had the same feelings as a<br/>\n&gt; child, and well into adulthood. She personifies *everything*. Everything,<br/>\n&gt; even rusty springs and perhaps even candy wrappers (that she won&#39;t throw<br/>\n&gt; away but will allow me to though perhaps she feels a twinge ;-), has a soul<br/>\n&gt; that needs someone to care for it. Which is really sweet! But expensive and<br/>\n&gt; a storage nightmare ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She wants things she can interact with. Furbies, robots, Gigapets, video<br/>\n&gt; games but very few of them come close to meeting the need she&#39;s trying to<br/>\n&gt; meet. What she *really* wants is a holodeck ;-) And all the money in the<br/>\n&gt; world spent on things that are sort of like that won&#39;t be satisfying.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And, yes, she has friends. But what she needs from friends is fellow actors<br/>\n&gt; in her fantasies. It&#39;s a rare kid who can fulfill that and she has only 4<br/>\n&gt; who meet that and none are close by. There&#39;s one girl in town who plays<br/>\n&gt; Pokemon and video games and they have loads of fun when they&#39;re playing and<br/>\n&gt; she always declares she&#39;s going to play with her more often, but doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; feel like playing when I ask if she&#39;d like to call. And she doesn&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; why.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only thing that comes close to being satisfying are her imaginary<br/>\n&gt; friends and writing and drawing comic books so it&#39;s fortunate her artistic<br/>\n&gt; talent allows that to be as satisfying for her as it is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So that&#39;s where we&#39;re coming from. I&#39;m usually too self-centered to see my<br/>\n&gt; own situation clearly, and really can only understand me when I can tell<br/>\n&gt; someone else where they&#39;re going wrong in the same situation ;-) Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce, I have to tell you that your daughter sounds charming and wonderful!  <br/>\nIt sounds like the usual math pages, and things like that are too concrete <br/>\nfor this magical child. There must be ways of feeding into her rich fantasy <br/>\nlife to get math concepts, etc....I am not a mathematician, but maybe some of <br/>\nthe more advanced stuff would be more interesting to her than boring old <br/>\narithmetic.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould your daughter enjoy some little faeries? I make these fun little <br/>\nfaeries, and would love to send her some.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a twelve year old son who still plays with his tribes of Beanies, and <br/>\nhas 17 squirrels living in his curly hair. (Actually, right now, eleven of <br/>\nthem are just making it to base camp to prepare for a summit attempt on <br/>\nEverest.) I have conversations with many of the squirrels, as does my <br/>\npartner. There is much speaking in interesting voices in this house. Julian&#39;s <br/>\nsquirrels (also a badger, and a few others) are very real, and the magic of <br/>\nJulian is that you can absolutely believe in the squirrels AND not question <br/>\nhis (or your own) sanity. The sanity of some of these animals is <br/>\nquestionable, however...there&#39;s a badger that thinks it&#39;s a squirrel, a <br/>\nsquirrel that thinks it&#39;s a pigeon...many of these poor critters seem to have <br/>\nsome sort of benign mental illness.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulian also is obsessed with rubber bands. He has a fantasy of someday <br/>\ngetting a job at Staples so he can enjoy the employee discount. It&#39;s an <br/>\ninteresting approach to collecting, because if we ever actually NEED a rubber <br/>\nband he&#39;s quite generous with them. (If anyone has a plethora of rubber bands <br/>\nin their home that they&#39;d like to get rid of, I know a kid who would be <br/>\necstatic to receive them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when I picture this kid in middle school, I sigh in relief that we <br/>\ndiscovered homeschooling before it became an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn, who figures that when you have one of these wierd kids it&#39;s best to <br/>\nlighten up and go along for the ride.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26079,"nextTopicId":26137}}
