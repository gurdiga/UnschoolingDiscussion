He scavenges candy off the floor of the car,<br/>\netc.  If the problem is emotional eating, what else<br/>\ncan be done so that the throwing up *isn&#39;t* forever?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect, though his parents have allowed him the<br/>\nfreedom to eat as much as he wants and throw up as<br/>\nmuch as he wants, that this is still a control issue,<br/>\nand there is a lot still there to keep him obsessive<br/>\nabout it. He knows he&#39;s not supposed to do it, and<br/>\nthat he&#39;s supposed to get better. I was allowed<br/>\nfreedom of eating, but there was a tacit understanding<br/>\nin our family that one could eat too much (and that I<br/>\n*was* eating too much) and that some foods were bad.<br/>\nThis was enough to create an unhealthy craving in me.<br/>\nI snuck food too, because I felt ashamed -- I bet he<br/>\ndoes too. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been a hard, hard habit to break, and I feel<br/>\nlike I&#39;m still recovering at 38 years of age. I think<br/>\nyou said they had been at this for several months,<br/>\nwell, it just may take longer than that for him to get<br/>\nemotionally healthy. What&#39;s more is that with the<br/>\ncrazy eating his chemical feedback system may be<br/>\nmessed up -- he may literally not be able to recognize<br/>\nanymore when his body needs him to stop. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat worked for me was to get out of that judgemental<br/>\nenvironment -- living alone. With no one looking over<br/>\nmy shoulder, I could relax a little, so that the<br/>\nrelational issues were no longer overwhelmingly at the<br/>\nforefront of my consciousness and I could begin to<br/>\nreally feel and listen to what was happening to my<br/>\nbody, and feel that my decisions ultimately rested<br/>\nwith me and what *I* wanted and believed. I assume<br/>\nthey either don&#39;t want to or can&#39;t do this for him<br/>\n(allowing him enough of his own space that his food<br/>\npreparation and intake can be separate from the rest<br/>\nof the family&#39;s.) All I can think is going as extreme<br/>\nSudbury as they can stand. In other words, give him<br/>\nnot only freedom of eating, but also freedom from<br/>\ntheir judgement (implying freedom to make his own<br/>\njudgements.) I think, short of shaming or forcing him<br/>\nto stop, that that is all that will work permanently<br/>\nand deeply and long-term. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Linda<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

His point is that <br/>\neverybody has needs and when those needs are met, others sort of pop up <br/>\nto replace them.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhysiological - First most basic needs are for air, water, food, sleep, <br/>\nsex, health, and so on. This includes the need to get rid of physical <br/>\nillness or pain or discomfort.<br/>\n<br/>\nSafety - These are psychological needs for stability and security of a <br/>\nhome and family and feeling safe in the world. The need for the world <br/>\nto make sense, to be logical and orderly, and to have some kind of <br/>\nconsistency.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove and belongingness are next on the ladder. Humans have a desire to <br/>\nbelong to groups: clubs, work groups, religious groups, family, gangs, <br/>\netc. We need to feel loved (non-sexual) by others, to be accepted by <br/>\nothers.  We need to be needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext self-esteem which results from competence or mastery of a task. <br/>\nAnd also there&#39;s the attention and recognition that comes from others. <br/>\nThis is similar to the belongingness level, however, wanting admiration <br/>\nhas to do with the need for power, competence, ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nSelf-Actualization<br/>\nThe need for self-actualization is &quot;the desire to become more and more <br/>\nwhat one is, to become everything that one is capable of becoming.&quot; <br/>\nThey can seek knowledge, peace, esthetic experiences, self-fulfillment, <br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Sandra that unschooling means nothing more than not doing <br/>\nschool at home and not imposing the trappings of school on our <br/>\nchildren. But unschooling successfully relies on our kids being in that <br/>\n&quot;self-actualization&quot; stage on Maslow&#39;s hierarchy. Children who have <br/>\ntheir other needs met will experience the need for self-actualization <br/>\nand that is what unschoolers mean when they say things like, &quot;Kids are <br/>\nnatural learners, just support their interests and passions.&quot; It is <br/>\nobvious that you cannot punish, starve, beat, deprive, or shame a kid <br/>\ninto being a &quot;natural learner.&quot; What is less obvious, but just as true, <br/>\nis that an unschooling parent&#39;s primary job is to provide for their <br/>\nchild&#39;s lower needs to be met so that the self-actualization need <br/>\nbecomes primary for them and THEN to help them and support them in <br/>\nsatisfying their desire to become everything they are capable of <br/>\nbecoming.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo lots and lots of talk on the unschooling topic will necessarily <br/>\nalways be about how unschooling works and THAT is always going to be <br/>\nabout how to get all those other needs met so that the kids can <br/>\nfunction and live in the &quot;self-actualization&quot; stage. Once they are <br/>\nthere - then unschooling just flows easily and it is obviously a <br/>\nwonderful satisfying way to live.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, for YEARS unschoolers have tried to come up with terminology <br/>\nthat would indicate more what we &quot;do&quot; rather than what we do not do <br/>\n(school). Maybe something that describes what we do as a sort of <br/>\nMaslowian Self-Actualization Program would work! &lt;G&gt; Instead of saying, <br/>\n&quot;We&#39;re unschoolers,&quot; maybe we could say we&#39;re &quot;Maslowians.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple of other interesting things about Maslow&#39;s ideas, <br/>\nthat apply to unschooling - this post is long so I&#39;ll put them in a <br/>\ndifferent one.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":75152181,"authorName":"bakerbeads@aol.com","from":"bakerbeads@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] HSLDA - Was -Unschooling Vs Homeschooling","postDate":"1101139230","msgId":101299,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg3LjFiM2I4NTMwLjJlZDM2NzFlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":101297,"nextInTopic":101300,"prevInTime":101298,"nextInTime":101300,"topicId":101279,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Sondra!

We started out &#39;homeschooling lite&#39; no<br/>\ncurriculum, just projects and journal entries and then<br/>\nI read about &#39;de-schooling&#39; which made sense so I<br/>\nstopped all formal education stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wondered if there are folks out there who have<br/>\nmade the adjustment from taking the kids out of school<br/>\nand would share experiences/advice.  This is a<br/>\ndecompression period for me as well as I went back to<br/>\nwork when Aaron was three (my husband came home) and<br/>\nworked long hours for the next 2.5 yrs.  We did<br/>\nattachment parenting, child-led weaning and have never<br/>\nrestricted food or been very strict about bed times,<br/>\nso the &#39;unschooling&#39; lifestyle doesn&#39;t seem much of a<br/>\nstretch for us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut now with them home all day and the weather getting<br/>\ncold, I find myself stuck.  They want to stay home all<br/>\nday, not go into the yard (till the snow comes at<br/>\nleast) not do anything except play X Box and watch TV.<br/>\n This is not MY best season, so the biggest problem<br/>\nwith all that is that I need to get out of the house<br/>\nmost days (if not every day) to avoid serious seasonal<br/>\ndepression.  On the days I insist (and tell them flat<br/>\nout that it&#39;s for me - that I just can&#39;t sit in the<br/>\nhouse all day) there&#39;s always a struggle about getting<br/>\nready, etc. and often they complain on the subway (we<br/>\nlive in the NYC area and have no car), but in the end<br/>\nwe usually have an incident-free good time.  When<br/>\nthere is an incident, I feel badly because, after all,<br/>\nI *forced* them to come out in the first place.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m conflicted about how hands on to be.  I<br/>\nread something about &#39;strewing&#39; (on this list I think)<br/>\na couple of months ago, but my attempts are so obvious<br/>\nto them - they just roll their eyes as if to say,<br/>\n&#39;come on, do you think we don&#39;t know what you&#39;re<br/>\ntrying to do?&#39;.  I want them to have freedom (and they<br/>\ndo) and be able to make good decisions (which we&#39;re<br/>\nworking on) and occasionally get out of the house (at<br/>\nleast until they are old enough to stay home alone so<br/>\nI can engage with the outside world)  Does anyone else<br/>\nout there have a bunch of little homebodies?  Any<br/>\ncreative suggestions on getting them out to do things<br/>\nyou know they usually love to do (not to mention<br/>\ntrying something new).<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this post went on, but it&#39;s so amazing to have a<br/>\ngroup of people who can relate.  When I talk to (most<br/>\nof) my friends about it, they&#39;re like, &quot;well get out<br/>\nof the house and away from those kids -- no wonder<br/>\nyou&#39;re loosing your mind!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nPamela - who is already getting cabin fever even<br/>\nthough it&#39;s only November! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I had side e-mail and when I tried the respond, the<br/>\n&gt; address didn&#39;t work, so <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve brought it here (minus the poster&#39;s name) so<br/>\n&gt; she might find it, and since <br/>\n&gt; others might be interested too.

I&#39;ve never been unschsandra or<br/>\n&gt; kookymum or pookyschooler or <br/>\n&gt; anything other than SandraDodd. So those who want to<br/>\n&gt; personify what they fear <br/>\n&gt; or are drawn to have used me as the poster<br/>\n&gt; screenname. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From the time Kirby was eight and I was on *Prodigy,<br/>\n&gt; I would say &quot;Unschooling <br/>\n&gt; can work; it works at our house.&quot; So the questions<br/>\n&gt; would be &quot;HOW does it work <br/>\n&gt; at your house?&quot; &quot;How are you getting this to work?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Why are you not giving <br/>\n&gt; up/freaking out?&quot; And I would tell them how, and<br/>\n&gt; why. And I would tell them why <br/>\n&gt; I was so confident, which was following in the<br/>\n&gt; footsteps of two other <br/>\n&gt; families, and having had five solid years of La<br/>\n&gt; Leche League-inspired attachment <br/>\n&gt; parenting. I had decided after reading an article in<br/>\n&gt; Mothering when Kirby was a <br/>\n&gt; baby not only to continue with child-led weaning,<br/>\n&gt; but not to require or forbid <br/>\n&gt; foods, and not to &quot;do dessert.&quot; My husband and I had<br/>\n&gt; been together for seven <br/>\n&gt; years before Kirby came, and we hadn&#39;t made a<br/>\n&gt; practice of having desserts after <br/>\n&gt; meals anyway, so that was easy and made simple<br/>\n&gt; sense. We would try to ensure <br/>\n&gt; that food was never an issue, nor a power struggle,<br/>\n&gt; nor infused with great <br/>\n&gt; import or danger.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So by the time Kirby didn&#39;t go to kindergarten<br/>\n&gt; (which was a tentative thing; <br/>\n&gt; we were willing to see how that went and then put<br/>\n&gt; him in K or 1st the next <br/>\n&gt; year, maybe), I didn&#39;t &quot;kind of think&quot; that he could<br/>\n&gt; learn and do well making his <br/>\n&gt; own decisions, I KNEW. I knew because he ate all<br/>\n&gt; kinds of foods without being <br/>\n&gt; forced, he never gorged on candy, he went to sleep<br/>\n&gt; when he was tired, he took <br/>\n&gt; care of his things without being forced to, and he<br/>\n&gt; shared without being made <br/>\n&gt; to. Letting him make his own decisions about how to<br/>\n&gt; be while we were generous <br/>\n&gt; and gentle with him had worked out perfectly well.<br/>\n&gt; And at that time I had a <br/>\n&gt; three year old doing equally well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Because of the way we lived as a family, unschooling<br/>\n&gt; worked.<br/>\n&gt; The questions being asked were &quot;Why does unschooling<br/>\n&gt; work for you?&quot; and &quot;How <br/>\n&gt; are you doing that?&quot; and &quot;What did you do?&quot; They<br/>\n&gt; were asking me, because I was <br/>\n&gt; saying &quot;Can TOO work&quot; in the face of an onslaught of<br/>\n&gt; irrate criticism from <br/>\n&gt; school-at-home folk.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then gradually the unschooling discussion was large<br/>\n&gt; enough to be separate, <br/>\n&gt; and there were other regular contributors. Those who<br/>\n&gt; communicated the most <br/>\n&gt; clearly and who were the most thoughtful and<br/>\n&gt; analytical were also seeing that one <br/>\n&gt; good power struggle could cause a parent to resent a<br/>\n&gt; child, and a child to wish <br/>\n&gt; to spite the parent. Spite and resentment do not<br/>\n&gt; help make an unschooling <br/>\n&gt; environment.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So when people insist that &quot;all unschooling is&quot; is<br/>\n&gt; just homeschooling without <br/>\n&gt; a curriculum or without lessons, I don&#39;t disagree.<br/>\n&gt; They should take it out <br/>\n&gt; and put it on billboards. Lobby to get it into the<br/>\n&gt; dictionary. Whatever. But <br/>\n&gt; when families come to ask how they can make<br/>\n&gt; unschooling work, it does no good to <br/>\n&gt; say &quot;Just don&#39;t have a curriculum. See ya!&quot; It takes<br/>\n&gt; layers of understanding, <br/>\n&gt; it takes recovery from school, and a desire to have<br/>\n&gt; a relationship with a <br/>\n&gt; child in which learning is flowing and easy. It<br/>\n&gt; takes working to create an <br/>\n&gt; atmosphere in which children and parents wake up<br/>\n&gt; happy to see the day. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abraham Maslow says (as teachers have studied for<br/>\n&gt; decades) that learning <br/>\n&gt; cannot take place where there is hunger, fear,<br/>\n&gt; stress, or a lack of positive <br/>\n&gt; regard. One known failure of school is their attempt<br/>\n&gt; to insert info into chldren <br/>\n&gt; who are hungry, stressed, afraid, and labelled &quot;bad&quot;<br/>\n&gt; or &quot;slow&quot; or even &quot;average.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One known failure of homeschooling is when the<br/>\n&gt; parents do the same kind of <br/>\n&gt; damage at home. If a child is not eating when she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; hungry, sleeping when she&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; tired, being with her loved ones when she wants to<br/>\n&gt; feel connected, and <br/>\n&gt; receiving positive regard, she will not &quot;naturally&quot;<br/>\n&gt; want to learn. She will naturally <br/>\n&gt; want to get food, companionship, safety, love.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some of those who have lately defined unschooling as<br/>\n&gt; NOT parenting-related <br/>\n&gt; are also saying that no one has the right to define<br/>\n&gt; unschooling. Interesting <br/>\n&gt; that they want to define it, then. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t really care as much about the definition of<br/>\n&gt; unschooling as I do about <br/>\n&gt; helping real individual families to unschool in a<br/>\n&gt; way that works, that can <br/>\n&gt; last, and not just be a temporary respite from<br/>\n&gt; school or curriculum, but that <br/>\n&gt; can be sustained and enlarging in and for their<br/>\n&gt; whole family. IF learning stops <br/>\n&gt; where &quot;parenting&quot; starts, how will unschooling be<br/>\n&gt; &quot;learning from life&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a problem. Perhaps there&#39;s a disconnect between<br/>\n&gt; talking about <br/>\n&gt; unschooling in a clinical, detached &quot;technical&quot; way,<br/>\n&gt; and helping actual people really <br/>\n&gt; get it to work as well as it can -- not settling for<br/>\n&gt; &quot;good enough for the state&quot; <br/>\n&gt; or &quot;academics covered,&quot; but moving on to self<br/>\n&gt; actualization right in one&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; own home. Maslow&#39;s self-actualization has<br/>\n&gt; traditionally been thought to be for <br/>\n&gt; adults, past school age. I look at the descriptions<br/>\n&gt; now, though, of <br/>\n&gt; self-actualization, and I know teens who are there.<br/>\n&gt; Unschooled teens.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Everyone won&#39;t decide on a definition of<br/>\n&gt; unschooling. It doesn&#39;t matter if no <br/>\n&gt; two families decide on a definition. But when I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; asked &quot;How did you do <br/>\n&gt; that?&quot; I&#39;m going to be honest. It&#39;s not about<br/>\n&gt; academics. It&#39;s about having changed <br/>\n&gt; how I saw the world and children, and then living<br/>\n&gt; harmoniously with my <br/>\n&gt; children in a world I *know* to be filled with all<br/>\n&gt; the elements they need to thrive. <br/>\n&gt; I suppose someone could spend a lot of volunteer<br/>\n&gt; time telling people how to <br/>\n&gt; unschool without changing their attitude or<br/>\n&gt; parenting.
