My friend thought that we were absolutely nuts to put the kids together that way -- she worried about their nakedness when they change clothes, etc. I tried to explain that if it&#39;s a bedroom and the others are activity-oriented rooms, then there is always a place they can go to chill out, rest, nap, read, or whatever. It&#39;s the quietest room in the house and has lush Florida vegetation right outside the window. We&#39;ve put a bunk bed and a toddler bed in there to maximize floor space. Just last night when I came home late from teaching a class, I went in to kiss them. I couldn&#39;t find the younger two in their beds -- they had climbed up and were snuggled on either side of their big sister. It was beautiful.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Bridget <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, November 16, 2001 9:56 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: room enough<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I had a room of my own and 1 brother much older than I.<br/>\n  I have allergies, bi-polar tendencies and a host of other medical <br/>\n  problems.
