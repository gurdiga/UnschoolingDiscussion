I didn&#39;t mind <br/>\nencouraging tapes playing in my head, from people who had thought I WAS capable <br/>\nand fun, but the negative loops and the insults I had endured and collected <br/>\nas a kid were categorized as &quot;toxic&quot; and to be cleaned up.--<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I had thought to do this. At the time I got married and had my daughter I was really young - and really didn&#39;t even know that there were &quot;issues&quot; related to my upbringing in an alcoholic house. I worry all the time that I am not doing this right(mothering). I know I am doing better than my mother - but I think I can do better.  - Which is why I am reading here ;-) I am always learning, but I wish that I was more conscious of what I lacked as a child. You mentioned in one of your talks about treating your child in he way that you wanted to be treated as a child. I really try and always do this - but there are times when things just come out - or I speak in a way that sound like the way my mother spoke to me and I feel like all I can do after is apologize and hope that I can do better next time.  I have times where I feel that my children&#39;s childhood is so much better than mine. Things that I do with/for my kids that my mother would never have done for me.   But at other times I feel really inadequate and unsure of myself. I get &quot;feedback&quot; from my in-laws and sometimes from my husband that are coming from such a different philosophy regarding children. All the things that we discuss here, bedtimes, TV control, making them eat everything on their plate, spanking, etc. The views of unschoolers are so opposite all of the old ideas, it seems it will take a lifetime for me to fully embrace it all - and just feel confident in them to the point where I know this is best for my children and that the other ideas are wrong! It&#39;s just those &quot;tapes&quot; I guess, that need replacing with positive ones. I just hope that the process in and of itself has a positive impact on my children. But I wish I had it all figured out from the outset.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Money Management - dealing with yoru own childhoos issues","postDate":"1108142073","msgId":103322,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM4LjU4NjQ1Y2FmLjJmM2U0MWY5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103318,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":103321,"nextInTime":103323,"topicId":103315,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/10/05 9:50:17 PM, bacwoodz@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1781409218\">In a message dated 2/10/05 9:50:17 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bacwoodz@...\">bacwoodz@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; but there are times when things just come out - or I speak in a way that <br/>\nsound like the way my mother spoke to me and I feel like all I can do after is <br/>\napologize and hope that I can do better next time.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=I feel like all I can do after is...-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s worth working on.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Better&quot; than a bad situation is better than nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to do your optimal best, first picture it and define it and <br/>\nREALLY know what your principal goals are.
