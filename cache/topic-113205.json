I tried to do this before but my daughter freaked a little.  I didn&#39;t tell the kids we were changing our way of schooling.  I just gradually stopped assigning things to do.  My son (9) happily moved on with his life but my daughter(13) was concerned about her education and asked for the schedule back.  I don&#39;t think she really likes the schedule.  It often takes her 3 weeks to complete a week of assignments.  I obviously don&#39;t enforce the schedule.
