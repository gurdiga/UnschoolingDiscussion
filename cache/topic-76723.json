Have fun on this new journey!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\nUnschooling Basics<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is trusting the child to learn what he needs to learn when he <br/>\nneeds to learn it. Unschooling is also sometimes called &quot;natural learning&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;child-led learning&quot; . But mostly unschooling is NOT school-at home: we do not <br/>\ntry to replicate school in our houses. It’s real living in the real world---for <br/>\nand with a purpose. You cannot live and not learn---we’re surrounded by real <br/>\nopportunities every day to learn. And it’s REAL learning, not simulated as in <br/>\nschool. Living is learning is unschooling is living is learning is <br/>\nunschooling..... <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several good books on the inanity and insanity of schools and on <br/>\nthe marvels of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschooling &quot;patron saint&quot; is John Holt. He was a school reformer in the <br/>\n70’s who came to realize that schools are NOT reformable. His most popular <br/>\nbooks are How Children Fail, How Children Learn, Teach Your Own, and Learning All <br/>\nthe Time.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Taylor Gatto was a NY city and NY state teacher of the year. He finally <br/>\nquit and started on the speaking circuit. He seems completely behind <br/>\nunschooling. His two big books are Dumbing Us Down and The Underground History of <br/>\nAmerican Education.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank Smith has a great little book called The Book of Learning and <br/>\nForgetting that shows how little one learns in and remembers from school. He pushes <br/>\nREAL learning---for a purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlfie Kohn’s Punished by Rewards shows the total inanity of EXtrinsic <br/>\nmotivation (gold stars, grades, etc.) and the attributes of INtrinsic motivation.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrace Llewellyn’s The Teenage Liberation Handbook  (How to Quit School and <br/>\nGet a REAL Education) is the &quot;bible&quot; for unschoolers. It’s a great read for <br/>\nteens, but parents should read it too. Be SURE not to skip the &quot;cute little story&quot; <br/>\nat the beginning. Grace also hosts the &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; in the early <br/>\nfall for teen unschoolers---a place to meet other unschoolers and share <br/>\npassions and interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Griffith has two books,  The Homeschooling Handbook and The Unschooling <br/>\nHandbook. The Homeschooling Handbook has many great ideas for documenting what’<br/>\ns being learned; and, since that is a requirement in SC, it’s very helpful. <br/>\nBut The Unschooling Handbook is THE handbook for new unschoolers. In it she <br/>\ngives real life examples and explanations. VERY understandable. Convinced my <br/>\nhusband that what I was suggesting made sense! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert has two: And the Skylark Sings with Me and Homeschooling and the <br/>\nVoyage of Self-Discovery. Both are witty---and easy reads.<br/>\n<br/>\nValerie Fitzenreiter has a brand new book that I have not yet read: The <br/>\nUnprocessed Child: Living Without School. It&#39;s about unschooling her daughter, <br/>\nLaurie. I&#39;m looking forward to its release.<br/>\n<br/>\nWebsites:<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.unschooling.com is THE website for unschooling. There are others that <br/>\n&quot;say&quot; they unschool; these are the radicals who KNOW what they are talking about. <br/>\nThere are essays and FAQs which you should definitely read first. Afterwards <br/>\ngo to the message boards and read, read, READ! If you have questions after <br/>\nreading for a few weeks, then post---but most things have been explained before, <br/>\nso if you read, you’ll run across the answers to most of your questions. The <br/>\nposters to pay attention to are Sandra Dodd, Joyce Fetteroll, Pam Sorooshian, <br/>\nAnne Ohman, and Mary Gold. There are other wonderful posters, but these are all <br/>\nradical unschoolers who all have great ways of expressing themselves and <br/>\ngetting to the nitty gritty of unschooling. They will all be at the conference in <br/>\nAugust.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling.com also has e-lists if you prefer your messages in mail form, <br/>\nbut the traffic is HIGH. 200-400/day. Unless you’re hard core, or just prefer <br/>\nyour lists this way, I’d recommend the message boards.<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.SchoolsOutSupport.org is the SC unschooling support group. Membership is <br/>\nfree. It has a message board and info about laws and local groups. It hosts <br/>\nthe unschooling conference in August.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd is a radical unschooler of three children, 16, 14, & 12 (I <br/>\nthink). She has her own website that is chocked FULL of essays and stories about <br/>\nunschooling. It’s a great place to start. www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling   She is <br/>\nalso the keynote speaker at the August conference.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare & Luz Shosie have an <br/>\nalready-graduated-from-college-always-unschooled son. Their website is full of short essays on unschooling. They have a <br/>\nnewsletter as well.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://borntoexplore.org/unschool/\">http://borntoexplore.org/unschool/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBilly and Nancy Greer own FUN-books---a mail-order catalogue for unschoolish <br/>\nbooks and games.www.FUN-Books.com<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the conference: Here’s the flyer:<br/>\n<br/>\n School’s Out Support’s Live & Learn Unschooling Conference <br/>\nAugust 22-24 in Columbia, SC at the Holiday Inn-Coliseum. <br/>\n    <br/>\nThis conference is a must attend! Meet other families on the same journey, <br/>\nlisten to inspiring speakers, and discover the art of unschooling in beautiful <br/>\ndowntown Columbia, SC. This is a non-age-discriminatory conference: anyone can <br/>\nparticipate in any Funshop or Presentation. Bring the whole family for a <br/>\njoy-filled weekend!<br/>\n    <br/>\nSchool&#39;s Out Support (SOS) is a volunteer-driven, statewide organization <br/>\nwhose mission is to support and promote unschooling, provide information, monitor <br/>\nand influence legislation, offer opportunities for families to get together, <br/>\nand empower families to make the choices that respect the rights, needs and <br/>\naspirations of their children. SOS welcomes anyone with an interest in <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince its inception in April 2001, SOS has supported families that have made <br/>\nthe decision to unschool as they face difficult questions and challenges. <br/>\nThese families may wonder about socialization, the legal issues surrounding <br/>\nunschooling, accountability associations, or integration of John Holt&#39;s educational <br/>\nphilosophy into their everyday lives. Some families may doubt their abilities, <br/>\nfeel confused and ask themselves, &quot;Can I really do this?&quot;. SOS encourages <br/>\nparents to trust themselves and their children to make good decisions and <br/>\nempowers them to find the support and information they need. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur Presenters<br/>\nFor our Keynote presenter we are very fortunate to have the popular <br/>\ncontributor to Unschooling.com message boards, its e-list, AlwaysLearning, and regular <br/>\ncolumnist in HEM---unschooling guru, Sandra Dodd. A former middle school <br/>\nteacher, Sandra has talked countless families into running away from school and <br/>\njumping into learning for fun. Her motto: &quot;Everything Counts!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re also delighted to have Anne Ohman, from the Unschooling.com message <br/>\nboards, back for a return engagement. She &quot;stole the show&quot; last year with her <br/>\ndebut and is now in demand at conferences all over the country. AnneO&#39;s <br/>\npassionate, gentle approach to life and learning continues to inspire families daily.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian is well known in &quot;all the unschooling <br/>\ncircles&quot;---Unschooling.com&#39;s message boards, the unschoolingdotcom e-list, AlwaysLearning, NHEN, and <br/>\nthe California boards. When she&#39;s not teaching college level economics and <br/>\nstatistics, Pam&#39;s an unschooling mom of three teenagers: she&#39;s &quot;been there, done <br/>\nthat&quot;---and will surely have a few answers for you!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Gold is better known as &quot;Zenmomma&quot;--and you can find her wherever <br/>\nunschooling is a topic! Mary &quot;preaches&quot; peace and trust and joy---and the pure <br/>\ndelight of unschooling her children. Her encouraging words are music to a stressed <br/>\nparent&#39;s ears---and she always leaves you knowing that &quot;Life is good!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Weiss&#39; storytelling has captivated and delighted both adults and children <br/>\nwith his original stories and retellings of classics. To hear him tell a <br/>\nstory is to be swept into another world. Jim&#39;s award-winning tapes are favorites <br/>\nin many homes---including ours!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information, contact Kelly Lovejoy @ (803) 776 4849 or visit our <br/>\nwebsite- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org/2003conference.html\">http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org/2003conference.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------<br/>\nYou may also all me anytime to ask questions or discuss concerns.
