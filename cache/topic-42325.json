An unschooling parent is a <br/>\nfacilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with curiosity and <br/>\nenthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and <br/>\nhow of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob <br/>\nSquarepants!

Everyone with an interest in <br/>\nunschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in <br/>\nmind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways <br/>\ndesigned to help each other become unschoolers or become better at <br/>\nunschooling.

I always <br/>\nhave an opinion :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read many things on this list that have made me uncomfortable but I view <br/>\nthat as a good thing.  I&#39;m free to take or leave the advice given...but I <br/>\nfigure I have a lot to learn and who better to learn from than those who have <br/>\ndone it for a long time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy very first post was the one about my boys being &quot;spoiled rotten.&quot;  I&#39;ll <br/>\nadmit than when Sandra posted the link to her article and I read it I was a <br/>\nbit miffed.  After all, I don&#39;t truly believe they are spoiled.  But after <br/>\nreflecting on it I realized that choosing your wording is important.  I <br/>\nactually then forwarded the article to my mom because we had a discussion <br/>\nabout kids being &quot;spoiled&quot; these days a few weeks ago.  It was a learning <br/>\ntool for me and my mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, another post (Sandra again I think) talked about the ghost <br/>\nstructure of school in my life.  I&#39;ve been thinking about that now...at first <br/>\nI dismissed it.  Afte all, they are young so why should I think about it.  <br/>\nBut then I thought about it more.  My IRL friends have a profound influence <br/>\non me and the fact that they are so obsessed with the &quot;proper&quot; education for <br/>\ntheir children makes me feel defensive and unsure.  I&#39;m still &quot;grading&quot; <br/>\nmyself by what I should do rather than what is best for my family.  I&#39;m <br/>\nafraid I&#39;ll make a mistake and ruin the boys for life (no matter how <br/>\nunrational that may sound.)  (I do have a really great story about this <br/>\nthough...for another post!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is (and I do have one):  if this list were not so challanging I may <br/>\nnot have gotten the chance to challange myself.  I can still disagree but if <br/>\nI find something that may be useful...a different way of looking at things <br/>\nperhaps...then I&#39;ll be better for it.  That will benefit my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only concern I&#39;ve had so far is that someone would think I didn&#39;t belong <br/>\nbecause my kids aren&#39;t &quot;school&quot; aged yet.  I was a little defensive on <br/>\nthat...but now that I understand better even that is gone. :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing uncomfortable is unpleasant but I don&#39;t feel as though I&#39;m being <br/>\nattacked or take it personally.  I love it when someone refers me to a link <br/>\nor website that I may not have seen before...even though for the poster it <br/>\nmay feel like the same old stuff. I feel that I can ask any question I <br/>\nwant...but just as I don&#39;t have to take their (meaning those who have been <br/>\nhere a long time) advice...they don&#39;t have to agree with me either.<br/>\n <br/>\nTanya<br/>\nmom to Andrew Jordan 4/1/00 and Eli Hunter 10/29/01<br/>\nYou cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within <br/>\nhimself <br/>\n--Galileo <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] General....Please read......New to board","postDate":"1030538879","msgId":42340,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5OTIzRUJGLkM0N0ElZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGFraTUzOStoZGU2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42334,"nextInTopic":42388,"prevInTime":42339,"nextInTime":42341,"topicId":42325,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

(I mean, who in their right<br/>\nmind would question the rightness of 3 meals a day? ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt throws you off kilter to let go of those things that -- objectively<br/>\nlooking at it -- mostly make life easier for us adults.<br/>\n<br/>\n(So maybe it helps to read the statements that come across as &quot;Here&#39;s the<br/>\nright way to think&quot; as &quot;If you look at it from this perspective, your world<br/>\nview is going to change.&quot; It&#39;s like having looked at the rear end of the<br/>\nstatue without realizing there&#39;s a front end.

I joined the list in January and have spent that time reading the emails, learning, listening, thinking - and being with my kids... Being on several email lists, I feel it is important for me to get a feel for a list - so I wouldn&#39;t post anything until I felt I had something to say/share/ask.This is just what works for me in email lists :-)...I am entirely comfortable with this list - I like the mix  of posts and posters - and , as a newbie, I have felt welcomed...Leonie W. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9440128,"authorName":"ElissaJC@concentric.net","from":"&lt;ElissaJC@...&gt;","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] General....Please read......New to board","postDate":"1030531417","msgId":42327,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzZDcwMWMyNGU3ZiRjNTBhNjBjMCQ5NjJhMDM0MEBFbGlzc2FKQz4="},"prevInTopic":42326,"nextInTopic":42334,"prevInTime":42326,"nextInTime":42328,"topicId":42325,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Also, for the newbies that are feeling so uncomfortable with posting or questions, please please please! email Joyce or Helen and talk to them about it, that s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1119534604\">Also, for the newbies that are feeling so uncomfortable with posting or<br/>\nquestions, please please please! email Joyce or Helen and talk to them about<br/>\nit, that&#39;s what they are here for!

No new person to this <br/>\nboard is going to brave these battle weary unschooling veterans in <br/>\narms to ask a simple question for fear of what the next post will say.<br/>\n &quot;Thats not an unschooling topic&quot;-- never direct, always later and <br/>\nvague OR  &quot;HOW could you think that way...&quot; OR &quot;WHAT are you <br/>\nSAYING&quot;...  and so on, you get my drift. To be here comfortably you <br/>\nmust be an unschooler from birth and have had no other opinion ever <br/>\nabout life or (gasp)schooling. ~~forgive the dripping sarcasm~~<br/>\n I, personally, enjoy  the various views whether I agree or not and <br/>\n(mistakenly) thought the point of such a board as this was to support <br/>\npeople on the journey of life; I thought unschooling was about a <br/>\nlifestyle not a school style...obviously ,newbie that I am, I was <br/>\nwrong(at least for this board). I am regretful of this opinion <br/>\nbecause I think there are many people on this board I could learn <br/>\nfrom,( and DO in spite of themselves) could garner information and <br/>\nsupport from-- but darn it all I&#39;m not asking here, it&#39;s just not the <br/>\nright forum for questions about parenting and life--only unschooling. <br/>\n(lol, SEE??? That is ridiculous, but it&#39;s the vibe being given in my <br/>\nopinion) <br/>\nI feel this was a necessary public post, I think those who have &#39;been <br/>\nthere, done that&#39; have so much to offer and should know that it is <br/>\nbeing wasted right now. Either you are the quiet not posting ones or <br/>\nthe ones we&#39;re wary of. Normally,I feel good about expressing my <br/>\nopinion  in life at anytime, but I also have received a few private <br/>\nemails of newbies expressing such opinions so I&#39;m taking it upon <br/>\nmyself to share for all-- lol admittedly taking heat in other words.<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t post rash, heated public replies to this  in attempts <br/>\nto &quot;correct&quot; my opinion, I am merely expressing it and don&#39;t wish to <br/>\ninflame the board, just let you pillars of support know that your <br/>\neffectiveness is lacking in reaching those with questions...we&#39;re <br/>\nnot &#39;afraid&#39; to ask, we just don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the hassle and we <br/>\ndon&#39;t think you&#39;ll listen, just lash out at what you disagree with.<br/>\nAnd please don&#39;t say &#39;not all of us are that way&#39; ...where are those <br/>\nof you that aren&#39;t :0) Why are you not saying  ~~ahem, newbies, don&#39;t <br/>\nbe shy, it&#39;s okay~~ lol<br/>\nOkay I&#39;m done...all that said -- WHOOOHOOOOO I AM SOOOO EXCITED TO BE <br/>\nUNSCHOOLING AND OUR LIFE IS A HAPPY FULFILLING ONE :0)-- Any and all <br/>\nprivate emails are welcome!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42402,"nextTopicId":42492}}
