I have one son left at home out of 6 children.<br/>\nThis was my 40th birthday surprise child.  He still sleeps in our room at<br/>\nage 9 1/2, he nursed only to 14 month--broke my heart when he self weaned,<br/>\nhe toilet trained himself just past his second birthday, has never been in<br/>\npublic school.  Since our other children were adopted as toddlers & older, I<br/>\nwas not able to do the strong attachment type parenting of them I wanted to.<br/>\nAlso due to their multiple special needs they often required more<br/>\ntherapeutic parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, to my situation--we are licensed therapeutic foster parents.  Our<br/>\ncurrent placement is a 13 year old boy with borderline mental retardation as<br/>\nwell as several mental illness diagnosis, he must be in public school.  If I<br/>\nallow him some of the freedom of choices that I would like to give, he does<br/>\nnot know what to do.  An example--food:  my 9 year old will only eat when he<br/>\nis hungry and usually makes pretty wise choices about what to eat, balancing<br/>\nhis diet over the course of several days.  However, the 13 year old will eat<br/>\nregardless of hunger and he craves sweets and carbohydrates of all kinds.<br/>\nSince he is only 5&#39;4&quot; and already weighs nearly 200 lbs and one of the goals<br/>\nof his treatment plan is to learn healthy eating habits, I can not give him<br/>\ncontrol of his diet.  I am giving him guidance thru only having healthy<br/>\noptions for snacks, making meals attractive and healthy, but I still must<br/>\nsay no when he asks for 3rd or 4th servings or wants a snack immediately<br/>\nprior to a meal.  TV and games systems are very much the same deal--the 9<br/>\nyear old will veg out for several hours occassionally--the 13 year old does<br/>\nnot know any other way to entertain himself, he has no other interests.<br/>\nTherefore, I limit his time in front of a screen and insist that he go<br/>\noutside to play.  We will only have this child for a few more months before<br/>\nhe returns home where he will be very rule bound--I&#39;ve watched his mother in<br/>\naction with him and don&#39;t see a lot of changes in that area.  Okay, there<br/>\nreally is a question here--how can I incorporate the same style of parenting<br/>\nwith this child and still give his the strong guidance that he needs to<br/>\nlearn how to make good choices?  I think that this will take more time than<br/>\nwe have with him--that the best I can hope for is to be able to show him a<br/>\nbetter way to live and help him learn to make the best choices out of what<br/>\nhe has available.  It does create some conflict when he sees that we do<br/>\ntreat the 9 year old differently, but remind him that fair does not always<br/>\nmean equal--that each child is different and has different needs therefore<br/>\nwill be treated differently.  Having rules for one child and a more<br/>\nprinciple led life for the other is difficult--not saying that we aren&#39;t<br/>\nprinciple driven for the other child, it&#39;s just that he is not principle<br/>\ndriven he is rule driven.
