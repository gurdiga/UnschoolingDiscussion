Do you think that could be because at home, in one-on-one you are<br/>\nable to see them coming and head them off faster or do you think that the<br/>\nsituation of having to &quot;share&quot; you sets her off?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was reading your description, I originally thought &quot;Well, I&#39;d want to<br/>\nrule out temporal lobe seizures&quot; while those often result in very temporary,<br/>\noften bizarre, changes in behavior, they are not situation specific.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I really felt it was affecting my relationships with people who are<br/>\nimportant to me, including my daughter, I would simply get a baby-sitter for<br/>\nthose times that I wanted to interact with others.  I do believe that it is<br/>\ngood to be supportive of your daughter&#39;s need to be with you, but you don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to wind up resenting her and in essence, becoming her captive.  That<br/>\nisn&#39;t desirable or healthy.  I&#39;m not advocating a baby-sitter on a daily<br/>\nbasis, just for those times when you feel if you have to stay home or deal<br/>\nwith a tantrum, you will really resent it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1756,"nextTopicId":44137}}
