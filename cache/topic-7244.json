It will stretch you in new<br/>\nways, as she is clear that real education is far different from the<br/>\n&quot;conditioning&quot; that takes place under the same name in schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also highly recommend Nancy Wallace&#39;s &quot;Child&#39;s Work: Taking Children&#39;s<br/>\nChoices Seriously&quot;.  I know of no book (including my own) which is more<br/>\nrespectful of the knowledge quests of children. (you can read more about it<br/>\non my website - www.skylarksings.com)<br/>\n<br/>\n2 1/2 is a great age to begin thinking clearly about what kind of education<br/>\nyou want for your child.  That way, you don&#39;t immediately get caught in the<br/>\nrut of thinking that &quot;education&quot; begins with kindergarten, or that somehow<br/>\neducation is somehow different from helping your son fulfill his life&#39;s<br/>\npath.  For regardless of what the future may hold, learning is a &quot;quality of<br/>\nlife&quot; issue both for your son and your family in the here and now.<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations on choosing a direction!<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert<br/>\n<br/>\n-----<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me&quot; is to homeschooling what Tom Paine&#39;s &quot;Common<br/>\nSense&quot; was to the American Revolution.&quot;-Greg Bates.

My<br/>\n&gt; son is just 2-1/2 and my husb. and I just recently realized that<br/>\n&gt; unschooling is what we want for his &quot;education.&quot;  It was such a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;lightbulb moment&quot; (as Oprah would say!) when I realized what this would<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; mean for our son, our home life, our careers, and it just feels so<br/>\n&gt; right.  I was never interested in homeschooling, i.e. following a school<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; curriculum at home, but when I started thinking about unschooling I<br/>\n&gt; realized that was really the alternative to education that I was looking<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; for, but unable to articulate.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7243,"nextTopicId":7248}}
