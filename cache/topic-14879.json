Then I thought<br/>\nabout what we did yesterday and realized this is the essence of<br/>\nunschooling and I love it when I realize that. *We* consists of me and<br/>\ndh and 3 kids, daughter age 10, son age 8 and baby boy age 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yesterday we big folks and the wee one were up around 6:30 (not my<br/>\nchoice). We put the sap on to boil that we&#39;ve been collecting from our<br/>\nmaples. This boiled all day and we had a quart adn a half of syrup by<br/>\nbedtime. The others got up around 8 or so.  We ate, messed around, read<br/>\na little (Kaleigh undoubtedly did some creative thing in here, I can&#39;t<br/>\nbegin to keep up with her on that score) and got dressed then had to go<br/>\ngrocery shopping before a dentist appointment for the two older ones.<br/>\nThe plan was to get done with the store and then have the baby fall<br/>\nasleep on the way to the dentist.  It worked and we got there early so<br/>\nwe sat in the car for a while and played a word association game which<br/>\nled to discussions on definitions and geography.  When Lochie woke up we<br/>\nwent in and read a magazine about birds before the kids went to their<br/>\nrespective chairs.  This was X-ray day so they got to see what their<br/>\nteeth are doing beneath the surface and I got to ask about<br/>\ndevelopment(health and technology).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got home we had lunch and then went for a walk up the rpoad to<br/>\nget the mail (1/2 mile or so each way).  Actually, Kaleigh and I walked<br/>\nand Cerid biked.  On the way he was seeing how slowly he could bike and<br/>\nexplained to me that it is hard to go in a straight line when you are<br/>\ngoing that slowly because the wheel on a bike is kind of like a<br/>\ngyroscope and the speed is what keeps it on track(physics and exercise!<br/>\nI had never thought about *why* it is hard to bike slowly, it just is!<br/>\nThen Kaleigh told me that she thinks that the pile of unusual poop that<br/>\nwe saw on the day before is actually droppings from a Ruffled<br/>\nGrouse(biology and physiology).  She came to this conclusion because she<br/>\nfound another pile of it in front of the house where we had see the<br/>\ngrouse a few days before.  (are there guide books for animal droppings?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids then played outside while I tried to figure out how to rig up a<br/>\nclothes line(conservation and engineering).  They were using Kaleighs<br/>\nkit of photoreactive fabric dyes (art and light)  They also checked out<br/>\ntheir respective perrenial gardens and compared who had the most stiuff<br/>\ncoming up and why (botany and weather).  Then some friends stopped in to<br/>\nplay for a few hours.  They were mostly outside but got silly inside and<br/>\ntook photos of eachother looking like ants.  DH came home early adn<br/>\nCerid helped him dig a trench to drain the water that is collecting in<br/>\nthe yard from the melting snow (hydrodynamics).<br/>\n<br/>\nDH took the two older ones to fencing class.  When they got home we<br/>\nplayed some math games before bed (from the Mensa math pack and a game<br/>\nbook).  This just happened because the cards were in reach when we were<br/>\nsnuggling on the livingroom floor.  We read a little before bed too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat really was a typical go-with-the-flow kind of day for us.  We have<br/>\nsome things on certain days (fencing, karate, sign language singing and<br/>\nskiing).  The rest is all as it comes.  Hope this helps.  I have found<br/>\nas I&#39;ve had to write those silly reports for the school, that it really<br/>\ndoes help to do this once in a while and write it down.

No day is typical. :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday we got up early and surprised dh with donuts in bed for <br/>\nhis birthday. (See yesterday&#39;s post on educationese--fire safety for <br/>\nthat whole story ;)  <br/>\n<br/>\nDownstairs we got out a root-vue kit that they had gotten for <br/>\nChristmas.  You are supposed to be able to see the roots of the <br/>\nplants that are growing.  We planted carrots, onions and radishes in <br/>\nthat.  We had the oppportunity to get out the rulers for that.  The <br/>\nwicks that soak up the water needed to be cut to 6 inches, and the <br/>\nseeds had to be planted 1 1/2 inches apart.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen dd and I played a card game called Set.  It is a lot of fun, <br/>\nalthough I can&#39;t beat my daughter. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, dd was off to play her new pokemon ruby game and I sat <br/>\non the computer with the 3 and 5 year olds playing Putt Putt for <br/>\nabout an hour.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe boys also spent a lot of time playing with their matchbox cars <br/>\nand water in the kitchen.  They dumped all of the toys out of the <br/>\nplastic containers in the playroom, carried them into the kitchen, <br/>\nand filled them with water.  The floor is covered with wet towels--<br/>\nthe kitchen has been this way for several days now. ;)  They made a <br/>\nwaterfall in there, boat rides, and car washes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDh and dd went on a bike ride together in the afternoon and then he <br/>\ncame home and built Thomas track with the boys.  Dd and I played <br/>\nsome more of our on-going Uno game together.  (We&#39;re playing until <br/>\none of us hits 10,000).  <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo of the kids helped me make manicotti and salad for supper and <br/>\nthey played computer games while dh and I watched a movie in the <br/>\nevening.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nToday the boys played on their computers for much of the morning and <br/>\ndd played her new pokemon ruby game. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the afternoon we went to the library, made a quick trip to Wal-<br/>\nmart to buy supplies for girls&#39; club which we hold in our house <br/>\ntomorrow, and then went to a playground in a different town.  The <br/>\nkids had never been to this playground.  They love it when I find <br/>\nnew ones to go to.  This one had two really tall sliding boards, a <br/>\nnice treat for them because neither of the parks in our town has any <br/>\nmore than a tiny rickety sliding board.  It also had a merry go <br/>\nround (that everyone sits on and one person runs around in a circle <br/>\nto make them go fast), seesaws and monkey bars.  No swings out for <br/>\nthe summer yet.  They had me push them really fast and they <br/>\npretended that it was a time machine.  As soon as it slowed down on <br/>\ntheir own they got off and pretended it was a different time period <br/>\nand that they were kings and queens.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also found a tree that had fallen over and you could see it&#39;s <br/>\nroots.  We found some coal and shale--the kind where you can split <br/>\nthe rocks in half rather easily.  We spent awhile looking for <br/>\nfossils and although we found a few little things that &quot;maybe&quot; were <br/>\nfossils, we didn&#39;t find any good ones.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to my mil&#39;s for dinner and I came home because someone&#39;s <br/>\ncoming to fix our furnace soon.  They are still there, helping her <br/>\nfill eggs for an easter egg hunt her church is having.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe movie Blank Check is coming on tv tonight and the kids want to <br/>\nwatch that.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;flyerkat&quot; <br/>\n&lt;flyerrod@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Would anyone be interested in giving me a sample of their typical <br/>\n&gt; day?

He does not like to write, hates math (lessons), <br/>\nloves to surf, skate, fish, dirtbike.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTypical days around here vary so much. For the most part, anyone coming here for a day or a week to see how and what my children are learning, would probably say nothing. All they do is play. Excluding of course those of you on this list. &lt;bg&gt; Even Tara is amazed what they know because as she puts it, they never really &quot;do&quot; anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids usually get up one at a time. Joseph (8) Sierra (7) and Alyssa (2) all have different times of waking and one never knows who will be up first. Sometimes one or all of them will come and snuggle with me in bed. Sometimes one or all of them will head to my mom&#39;s and hang out with her. (she has an attached MIL apt) Sometimes one or all will turn on the tv and not see anyone else, or just start to play a movie from the night before that they didn&#39;t finish. (meaning act out with their toys) or just start drawing. My kids are usually up for an hour before they ask for food. They usually all eat at the same time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we are staying in for the day, the play goes from there. It varies in activity and time spent on each one. Sometimes it&#39;s all short and moves quickly from one thing to another and sometimes they literally may spend hours doing somthing. It&#39;s tv, reading, either to themselves or to Alyssa. They play on the computer, lately a lot. They found this thing on postopia where it asks questions and then you have to fill in the right letters to spell the answer. I&#39;m amazed at how well Sierra spells. Gameboy and playstation have been set aside for quite awhile now. Sometimes they play board games, either with me or my mom or just with the two of them. Joseph was taking great pleasure in watching Price is  Right with my mom, although he hasn&#39;t in the past few days. He loves shows like that and is really good in math, all in his head. Sierra loves the Animal Planet channel. Joseph doesn&#39;t like it much and usually heads to his room when Sierra has it on in the playroom. Joseph draws a lot and spends a big portion of his days lately drawing elaborate pictures. Right now it seems to be city scenes. Sierra will join along sometimes and then there is also paints that come out and play dough or creepy crawlers. About 2 weeks ago, the play dough was out every day for a week. All 3 kids played with that. <br/>\n<br/>\nSierra and Joseph will take turns playing with Alyssa sometimes and sometimes the 3 of them will all play together. It&#39;s with dinosaurs or horses or Polly Pockets or Barbies. Sometimes just links, marbles and balls. There is an awful lot to choose from here for them to play with. Sometimes they help cook or bake. Sometimes they are outside in the back yard, playing ball or just swinging or hunting rocks. Lately they like an evening walk searching for snail shells. We have tons of them now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have also been hanging out with Tara (17) in her room and with her boyfriend when he&#39;s over. (every night!) Sierra and Alyssa spend the most time in there with them. They play games or watch tv together. Evenings they do different things with Joe when he&#39;s home. Usually games and computer stuff. Although Joe is knows to chasing them all around the house playing monster too!!! There&#39;s food and cleaning up and showers in between all this too. Never at any certain time. The children&#39;s hours are from about 10:00-11:00 a.m. until 11:30 or 12:00. Joseph usually stays up later. Sometimes with me until 2:00.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the closest thing to seeing learning by school terms is that some encyclopedia&#39;s are missing and in Joseph&#39;s room. Some days seem more educational with the kids asking questions that we look into instead of just me answering. Those days aren&#39;t too often lately. No major research has been going on here for awhile. Doesn&#39;t bother any of us in the least. We play. A lot. And most people would say that&#39;s all we do. We&#39;re a happy family.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8226888,"authorName":"the_clevengers","from":"&quot;the_clevengers&quot; &lt;diamondair@...&gt;","profile":"the_clevengers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: typical day","postDate":"1048525466","msgId":61845,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI1bmRxcSt1cXE1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGI1bXZrMCtvNjFzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61843,"nextInTopic":61848,"prevInTime":61844,"nextInTime":61846,"topicId":14879,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I find that the hardest thing <br/>\nto do at the beginning is to learn to just *get out of the way*. Kids <br/>\nwill learn, if we just don&#39;t try to make them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So frequently I will fall back on structured lessons out of <br/>\n&gt; panic, thinking they are not learning anything if I don&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you haven&#39;t done so already, I&#39;d suggest a trip to the library or <br/>\nbookstore. You can fill up on books like &quot;Learning All the Time&quot; by <br/>\nJohn Holt, &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; by Grace Llewellyn <br/>\n(which is not just for teenagers, it&#39;s great for anyone to read who <br/>\nis starting out on an unschooling journey). Really, the hardest part <br/>\nof unschooling for most people is getting their *own* head wrapped <br/>\naround the idea that kids will learn *without* teaching. That <br/>\nteaching them is not only not necessary, it is completely counter-<br/>\nproductive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe if <br/>\n&gt; I saw how others are doing it, I could be inspired.  I often wonder <br/>\n&gt; if we are doing enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d also suggest sitting down and thinking about what your own <br/>\npassions are. What are *you* interested in learning? When you are <br/>\noccupied with following your own interests, you will accomplish two <br/>\nthings. The first is that you give your kids a great model of how <br/>\n*you* learn new things, the mistakes you make, the things that keep <br/>\nyou going. The second is that it gives you something to occupy your <br/>\nmind so that you don&#39;t obsess about exactly how much your kids are <br/>\nlearning at any given time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here&#39;s a typical day for us:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son wakes up about 6:00, he usually peeks in on me and then goes <br/>\noff to build with Lego or Bionicles. I either sleep in or get up and <br/>\ndo email and daily organization. My daughter wakes about 7:00 or so <br/>\nand we all go down and make breakfast. If I&#39;m cooking something, <br/>\nusually one of the kids helps out. After we eat, I do whatever <br/>\ncleaning up needs to be done, and sometimes the kids help out or <br/>\nsometimes they go to play or do writing or painting or use the <br/>\ncomputer. <br/>\nThen we&#39;re usually off for wherever we&#39;re going for the day. On <br/>\ndifferent days we have different activities - violin lessons, <br/>\nhomeschool singing group, homeschool park day or gymnastics day, a <br/>\nplaydate, our &quot;Homeschool Hogwarts&quot; group will be starting back up in <br/>\ntwo weeks, and if the weather&#39;s nice we might go hiking or for a bike <br/>\nride, if not we might hit the pool or the library, or the science <br/>\ncenter, sometimes we have homeschool field trips or other activities. <br/>\nWe often ride our bikes for transportation to wherever we&#39;re going. <br/>\nToday we have violin lessons in the morning, and then we&#39;ll either go <br/>\nto the library or to someplace outside if the weather&#39;s good. <br/>\nAt some point in the day, DH will take over and I&#39;ll go do my workout <br/>\n(triathlon training and coaching is one of my interests), and if I&#39;ve <br/>\ngot a writing project going, I will take time to do that as well. If <br/>\nI&#39;m in an editing stage, my son often sits with me while I read my <br/>\nwriting out loud and edit it. Afternoons are usually time at home and <br/>\nwe might do a craft project, or I&#39;ll read to the kids, or we&#39;ll cook <br/>\nsomething for dinner, or the kids will play. We often have other kids <br/>\nover to our house, it seems to be becoming the place where kids <br/>\ncongregate. Evenings we do different things. Monday night is <br/>\nour &quot;Family Movie night&quot; and the kids take turns picking the movie. <br/>\nWe usually go swimming two evenings a week, and other nights we might <br/>\nplay games, read, do puzzles, or just each do our own thing. <br/>\nBedtime I always read a picture book or two and then read from <br/>\nwhatever chapter book we&#39;re in the middle of (Lord of the Rings right <br/>\nnow) and snuggle up with the kids to go to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure on any given day I could look at what we&#39;re doing and <br/>\nsay &quot;We haven&#39;t done much today&quot; and I could choose to freak out <br/>\nabout it and panic. But when I look back over a week or a month I can <br/>\nsee the rich tapestry of fun and learning that is our life. This <br/>\nmonth we saw two baby lambs being born, we went to the science museum <br/>\nand did some chemistry stuff there, we&#39;ve baked bread, watched the <br/>\nfirst bees buzz on our new flowers, worked in our garden, rode <br/>\nbicycles and swam, played music together and found new music to <br/>\ndownload on the internet that each of us liked, completed a new <br/>\npuzzle, played trains and legos and raced hot wheels cars down our <br/>\ndriveway, hiked to the river and sailed &quot;fairy boats&quot;, watched a war <br/>\nbeing launched on TV, got out our globe and atlases, looked at where <br/>\nIraq and Kuwait and Turkey and all those other places are located, <br/>\nthe list goes on and on. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut *none* of these things were done with the intent of <br/>\ncreating &quot;teachable moments&quot; or &quot;learning opportunities&quot;. They were <br/>\nall done because one or more of us were interested in that particular <br/>\nactivity at that time. They were done because they were fun and <br/>\ninteresting and just part of an enjoyable life. The learning is in us <br/>\nand of us and all around us. We don&#39;t have to seek for it, we just <br/>\nhave to have the faith to get out of its way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] typical day","postDate":"1048525305","msgId":61843,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMuZDEwZDNiZi4yYmIwOTNmOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61836,"nextInTopic":61845,"prevInTime":61842,"nextInTime":61844,"topicId":14879,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/24/03 6:02:40 AM, flyerrod@digital.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1458307116\">In a message dated 3/24/03 6:02:40 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:flyerrod@...\">flyerrod@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; He does not like to write, hates math (lessons), <br/>\n<br/>\nloves to surf, skate, fish, dirtbike. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s ten, so reading a lot on his own isn&#39;t natural anyway.

It just happens as my boys live their lives.  They can&#39;t help <br/>\nit.  And it they find something worth investigating they will learn more.  <br/>\nThey will ask questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday.  <br/>\nWe got up early for us, 9:00.  And started with a trip to the feed store for <br/>\ngarden things.  We tilled the garden and put straw on it.  Planted some root <br/>\nveggies.  Seeded a bare spot on our lawn, finished marking spots for holes <br/>\nfor posts for our new deck.  Watched &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. Boys had a craving for <br/>\npopcorn chicken so I took them to KFC, yuck!!  Finished up the top for a <br/>\ndrunkards path quilt to donate to the unschooling conference raffle.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys had lots of fun with he straw.  Moving it from one place to another.  <br/>\nTrying to push the bails up hill.  Making a bed out of it.  And then a bench <br/>\netc.  They loved the watering part of the lawn.  Helped some with the <br/>\nplanting.  Also helped some with marking the spots for the holes.  They hit <br/>\nsome golf balls and played in the sand.

I<br/>\noften crawl into bed with them and snuggle and  read a few chapters of<br/>\nwhatever book we have going.  We just read the first 4 chapters of &quot;A<br/>\nWrinkle in Time&quot; but decided it doesn&#39;t go fast enough for our tastes,<br/>\nso we are looking to start something else. One eats breakfast right off,<br/>\nthe other generally waits a couple hours.  After we come downstairs,<br/>\nmost days the girls play pretend for awhile.  Lilly often heads to the<br/>\ncomputer mid-morning to play Roller Coaster or Zoo Tycoon. (very<br/>\neducational!) Leigh sits with her and gives her ideas and enjoys playing<br/>\nvicariously  through Lilly.  ;0)  Sometime over the course of the<br/>\nmorning, I remind the kids to brush their teeth and I encourage them to<br/>\nbrush their hair so it doesn&#39;t get too tangled.  If we are staying home<br/>\nfor the day, they rarely get dressed.   The last few days the weather<br/>\nhas been nice and we went bike riding in the afternoon.   I put the kids<br/>\nbikes in the car and we drive to a cul de sac up the road a piece<br/>\nbecause we live on a busy road.<br/>\n <br/>\nEvery day is different, but they do go in cycles.  Lately, the TV hasn&#39;t<br/>\nbeen very popular.  I turned it from the war to cartoons this morning<br/>\nwhen they got up.  I feel like we have watched it too much.  They<br/>\nwatched for an hour then shut it off and now are in the bathroom mixing<br/>\nshampoos and conditioners to give their beanie babies a bath.   They<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have turned it on, had I not done it for them.  They want<br/>\ncompany this afternoon, so I will call their friend to see if she can<br/>\ncome over and play.<br/>\n <br/>\nI finally remembered to pick up some borax the last time I grocery<br/>\nshopped.  We made crystal snowflakes and silly putty yesterday.  They<br/>\nspent half the day cutting up magazines and giving the people in them<br/>\nmakeovers with gel pens.  The gel pens write great on magazine paper.<br/>\nWe discussed the war a lot.  They played.  Oh ya, they found a wooly<br/>\nworm (caterpillar) the day before yesterday and made a little home for<br/>\nhim in a cup with a few sprigs of green grass to eat.  They let him go<br/>\nwhen they were done playing with him.<br/>\n <br/>\nOver the course of a week or a month, I am sure we cover and cover well,<br/>\nall the required subjects.  We read (I read to them, they can read, but<br/>\ndon&#39;t choose to read books to themselves yet, they read on zoo and<br/>\nroller coaster tycoon and similar things), do science (wooly worm, zoo<br/>\ntycoon, borax, cooking, discuss health issues like why we brush our<br/>\nteeth), cover history/geography (war and we love our globe and maps),<br/>\nlanguage arts (how can you not?  But Lilly loves to write stories), math<br/>\n(zoo tycoon, roller coaster tycoon, cooking, spending money, playing<br/>\nboard games and card games).  You can&#39;t just look at one day,  you have<br/>\nto look at a month to see the big picture.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI hope this helps.

Our typical days at the <br/>\nmoment start very early because the kids all received puppies for Christmas. <br/>\nThe kids decided they wanted to start raising puppies so I took the money I <br/>\nmade in my business this Christmas and bought pups. So now our days start <br/>\nabout 6:00 with whining pups wanting to go out. I let the kids each have half <br/>\nan hour each morn to use the playstation or pc, whichever they choose. After <br/>\nthat and breakfast the kids wander off to do individual projects while I get <br/>\nsome work done on the pc. For the younger boys this may be drawing, legos, or <br/>\nbuilding one thing or another. Right now they are in the middle of building <br/>\nramps and rails for their bike stunts. My 15 yr. old likes to spend her free <br/>\ntime working with her dog, she trains dogs in obedience. She also enjoys <br/>\nneedlepoint. The 17 year old takes the other computer usually and works on <br/>\nher web page, helps me with the business, or chats with friends online. She <br/>\ncan type a smooth 75 wpm. She is also our resident builder and often gets out <br/>\nher power tools and builds something. As I type this she is building a dog <br/>\nexercise pen. Late morn everyone comes in to go through a Tae Bo tape. If the <br/>\nweather is nice we often go for a bike ride or run instead. We then take <br/>\nturns fixing lunch. Whoever is not cooking  helps with household chores. <br/>\nAfter lunch I do ask that everyone takes some time to read for a while. This <br/>\nis not a problem as we all enjoy reading. Afternoons are spent in various <br/>\nways. There is always work to be done. We usually have a book that we are <br/>\nreading aloud, we enjoy that. The girls wanted to take Japanese so they <br/>\npractice and do lessons. They also each play a musical instrument so they <br/>\nusually practice that too. The boys like to spend some time on the computer. <br/>\nThey also work on a drawing program we bought. Three days a week everyone <br/>\nlifts weights, it is up to them to work it in and keep track of their <br/>\nprogress. All four find time to work on a monthly newsletter that they send <br/>\nto distant relatives. Twice a week in the evenings is karate and weekends are <br/>\nspent at BMX races 8 months out of the year. TV during the day is limited to <br/>\nan occasional show on the Travel Channel, Discovery, or Animal Planet. Some <br/>\nof their shows are excellent. The evenings that we are home are spent <br/>\npreparing the meal and we do a quick house pickup before Dad gets home.

She also has a part time job 2 days a week<br/>\n&gt;working at an Art Print Shop. She is into survivalist/nature stuff right<br/>\n&gt;now..learning animal tracking and finding out about wild edibles and making<br/>\n&gt;outdoor shelters. She is also planning an extended backpacking trip just as<br/>\n&gt;soon as it warms up. She just finished with an in-depth study of Ireland<br/>\n&gt;after reading the book &quot;Angelas Ashes&quot;.

She spends lots of time working on art<br/>\n&gt;stuff as that seems to be the particular &#39;bent&#39; of our family. Loves to<br/>\n&gt;count her money, and is learning to use the keyboard so she can type her own<br/>\n&gt;emails to a penpal. She plays chess and puts together puzzles.
