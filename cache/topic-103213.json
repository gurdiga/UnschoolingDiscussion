I think it has less to do with the video game and more to do with<br/>\nhow an individual copes with challenging things. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a kid was building a radio and was very focused but was running into a<br/>\nproblem the frustration would be the same.  The irritability would be the<br/>\nsame kind of feeling that some people experience after working on/having<br/>\nproblems with a really challenging game.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband loves old cars and loves working on them but when he&#39;s stumped<br/>\nby some problem he makes his stress and frustration know to those around<br/>\nhim.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the game or the computer it&#39;s the challenge and the effort it<br/>\ntakes to overcome the problems within a game in order to move to the next<br/>\nlevel and the way a body naturally deals with the stress of that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Dylan was preparing for a belt test in Tae Kwon Do he&#39;d work on some<br/>\nproblem kick or poomse.  He&#39;d do it over an over again trying to get it <br/>\nright.  If he hadn&#39;t yet mastered it, he felt very frustrated after<br/>\nworking for hours and not making any progress.

A<br/>\ncouple of things have occurred to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. When I did limit Fisher&#39;s TV (he&#39;s 7.5), if he had a day he could<br/>\nwatch it all day, he was pretty grumpt at the end of the day. I<br/>\nalways said this was one reason why I needed to limit it. But when I<br/>\ndid take off the limits, and really made space and time that he could<br/>\ndo all the video things he wanted to, within a few weeks he was<br/>\nhandling it fine. Within a month or two he had taught himself to<br/>\nwatch and play something else and talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nVideo games do take more focus than TV, but perhaps your son just<br/>\nneeds the time and space to learn how to handle the &quot;RAM allocation,&quot;<br/>\nthat is, how to manage his own attention and energy. (We have the<br/>\ncomputer set in front of the TV, all near a comfy couch and a table<br/>\nfor toys and Yu-gi-oh cards and snacks. It&#39;s in a central, prominent<br/>\nplace of the house.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I wonder if it&#39;s more appropriate to separate the &quot;hyper&quot; or<br/>\nirritability thing from the video games, per say. If I&#39;d been reading<br/>\nan exciting book, or trying to solve a particularly tricky problem,<br/>\nI&#39;d be pretty hyper afterwards, too, and wrapped up in thinking about<br/>\nit, and unresponsive to others trying to talk about other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if helping him with sensory things at that point might be<br/>\nuseful. Giving him a backrub or a good squeeze to help him &quot;get out<br/>\nof his head&quot; and back into his body (if he agrees, of course). Giving<br/>\nhim an outlet to throw his own body around -- a mini-tramp, some of<br/>\nthe other indoor/&quot;therapeutic&quot; gym equipment that we&#39;ve talked about<br/>\non this list.

The exchange on those lists aren&#39;t<br/>\ngeared toward understanding why something&#39;s happening or why something<br/>\nworks. The exchanges are mostly &quot;Here&#39;s a bit of our lives,&quot; and &quot;Here&#39;s<br/>\nwhat works for us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich suits many people just fine. That&#39;s what they like.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it doesn&#39;t suit everyone. So this list fills the needs not met by the<br/>\nother lists. (And the other lists fill the needs not met by this list!) Some<br/>\npeople love to dig deep and understand why and how unschooling works, why<br/>\nand how to respect children. That&#39;s what this list is about and the people<br/>\nwho need that are who it&#39;s oriented towards because the other lists can&#39;t<br/>\nserve their needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause this list is totally different we send out a lengthy description<br/>\nthat will help people understand how the list is different from what they<br/>\nmay expect and a list of rules that will help people get the most from the<br/>\nlist.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is why to this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I do have a problem with his behavior afterwards.  I don&#39;t care what the<br/>\n&gt; activity is that precedes it, the rest of us deserve to be treated civilly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I will reply that if you don&#39;t understand why he&#39;s getting irritable, it&#39;s<br/>\ngoing to be harder to find a solution. Why something is happening is more<br/>\nimportant than what is happening. The what is merely a symptom and making<br/>\nthe symptom go away won&#39;t make the cause go away. That&#39;s why I suggested<br/>\nplaying or being with him so you could get more information on why it&#39;s<br/>\nhappening so you could find a better way to help him.<br/>\n<br/>\nConventional parenting is about responding to symptoms. Aware parenting --<br/>\napplying the unschooling philosophy to parenting -- is about helping them<br/>\nget what they want from life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; unfortunately at this time in my life I cannot sit for hours and do this with<br/>\n&gt; him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You said it only takes half an hour for him to get irritated so you won&#39;t be<br/>\nplaying for hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From your replies I guess the answer is yes, some of you are familiar with<br/>\n&gt; this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The symptom is familiar to problems other people have experienced. That<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s why it&#39;s happening to your son. Irritability *can* be a<br/>\nway for kids to communicate that they need something from us that they<br/>\naren&#39;t getting. Often when they&#39;re being the most irritating is when they<br/>\nneed to be loved the most. And sometimes it means they&#39;re working something<br/>\nout and need the space to do it. To treat one like the other would not be<br/>\nhelping the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut alerting him to a tone is part of the solution too. Helping them get<br/>\nthey want without stepping all over everyone else and alienting everyone is<br/>\npart of helping them get what they want!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Alot of assumptions were made in a very short summary of<br/>\n&gt; what I wrote.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What people write is all anyone has available to form a reply from.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s Rule 10:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; 10. Read and write as clearly as you can. In casual conversation we often<br/>\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t realize how much we rely on others to fill in the gist of our<br/>\n&gt;&gt; conversation based on what they expect us to say. But here, without body<br/>\n&gt;&gt; language or inflection, all we have to go on are your words and they should<br/>\n&gt;&gt; say what you mean. If you say, for example, you &quot;never&quot; do something, it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; should not mean &quot;almost never.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I do need to clarify a few things<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Only if you realize that explaining will help someone give you a better<br/>\nanswer. But I don&#39;t think you&#39;re looking for an answer which is why Rule 4<br/>\nis:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; 4.

The ideas that don&#39;t are questioned and examined.)<br/>\n<br/>\nA better solution that will help someone move towards unschooling is helping<br/>\na child figure out ways to get what she wants -- rather than figuring out<br/>\nhow to make the one solution the parent comes up with work.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe and you could brainstorm ideas. She could (with as much help from you as<br/>\nshe would like) try them out. She could assess how well the current solution<br/>\nis working. She could tweak the current solution or dump it and try another.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s problem solving that can apply to just about anything she&#39;ll face. It<br/>\nhelps her think about problems and think about the consequences and think<br/>\nabout how to fix them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":108210662,"authorName":"lite2yu2000","from":"&quot;lite2yu2000&quot; &lt;livinginabundance@...&gt;","profile":"lite2yu2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Article","postDate":"1108036762","msgId":103279,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGN1ZmlhcSt0bTkyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU5LjIwZWYzYzRkLjJmM2M0MWJmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103278,"nextInTopic":103282,"prevInTime":103278,"nextInTime":103280,"topicId":103213,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey everyone, I have been lurking for quite a while. . .

I also appreciate that some of you are going through the same thing in your family.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI do need to clarify a few things - as far as my 6 year old watching TV - she knows the channels are locked, that  I did it, and they will come back on. She would complain at night that she did not do everything she wanted to do, I pointed out to her that she watched TV most of the day and thats where her time went, she agreed and asked for my help, the locking out the addicting channels was how I helped. And she had only been without TV for one year, but she had plenty of access to videos.  I have not lied to her.  I do admit I do not like TV taking up so much of her life, she thinks her TV viewing was fine, she just didn&#39;t have enough time to do everything she wanted and she was not able to stop watching on her own.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlot of assumptions were made in a very short summary of what I wrote.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs far as my son & the computer - <br/>\nI don&#39;t have a problem with the games he is playing, I don&#39;t have a problem with his computer usage (as long as others alos get their time.)  I do have a problem with his behavior afterwards.  I don&#39;t care what the activity is that precedes it, the rest of us deserve to be treated civilly.  Neither I nor anyone else in the family made him leave the computer because he needed to use the bathroom, we didn&#39;t suggest or force him to sign-up for basketball, what have you. The grumpiness is there wether he stops on his own or because something has forced his stopping.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have played with him. One game in particular I&#39;ve played with him many times. Over Christmas while my husband was on vacation 5 of us played a multi-player game that lasted weeks, and that wasn&#39;t the first time we&#39;ve done that.

Those of you who can great - I can&#39;t.  I know enough about the games & history that when he comes to me and tells me about a great discovery or weapon, or whatever I know what he is talking about and can share in the joy and he can relay the experience to me. I do know who he is.<br/>\n <br/>\nI was wondering, and I guess I did not ask it outright enough, but does anyone else deal with the phenomena of computer play bringing on irritabilty.  I appreciate those of you who answered.  From your replies I guess the answer is yes, some of you are familiar with this.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks again to those of you who replied with helpful suggestions.

A big no for onboard sound and the PSU will have to be<br/>\n500W and a brand name. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really pays to do a lot of research to avoid buying the worng thing, esp.<br/>\nif he&#39;s building a gaming computer that he&#39;ll likely want to upgrade<br/>\nrelatively frequently.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn (in NS)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Computer Irritability","postDate":"1107904337","msgId":103214,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRFMzZDMzJDLjcyNzg3RURELjBDOEQ0NUE4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103213,"nextInTopic":103215,"prevInTime":103213,"nextInTime":103215,"topicId":103213,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Because of other things going on right now she is needing to be more independent so I needed certain channels on the TV to not work once in awhile.-=- Are","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1267548688\">-=- Because of other things going on right now she is needing to be more independent so I needed certain channels on the TV to not work once in awhile.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you lying to her?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we do with computer time is that whoever is playing can play as long as he or she wants to, and we know whose turn is next.  When the first person is done, the second one can have it as long as he or she wants to.  Sometimes those turns are two hours, sometimes ten minutes.  It&#39;s not okay for the person who&#39;s next to hover or nag at all.  Never has been, since they were pre-readers playing the simplest games with shapes and numbers.    It IS okay to negotiate if someone is about to have to leave and need to check e-mail or something. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result of this policy, after a dozen years, is that people will ask if anyone else needs the computer really quick if they&#39;re about to start something long.  They&#39;re generous about letting others in for short times, and everyone is honest about how long they think they&#39;ll be on.  We also have more than one computer now, which I highly recommend, but we got along well with it when we only had one, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen parents say a child is getting grouchy, on more examination, it often seems that the grouch-determining factor is something like the unhappiness of others, the impatience of others, a time limit, or someone saying &quot;Turn it off and come eat&quot; regardless of where he is in the game or reading or video-watching.  Some things don&#39;t pause or rewind or save.  When parents are generously understanding with children, children can become generously understanding with siblings and parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163799996,"authorName":"Bethann  & Daniel Donahue","from":"&quot;Bethann  & Daniel Donahue&quot; &lt;badonahue@...&gt;","profile":"badonahue2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Computer Irritability","postDate":"1107903282","msgId":103220,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGMwMWM1MGUzMSQyZGNmNjRjMCQ2NDE3YThjMEBWQUxVRUQzMjUzNjAyRj4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUwMjA4MjI0MTA3LjQ3ODgucW1haWxAd2ViNTE2MDcubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103219,"nextInTopic":103225,"prevInTime":103219,"nextInTime":103221,"topicId":103213,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s funny you should say that.

Because of other things going on right now she is needing to be more independent so I needed certain channels on the TV to not work once in awhile. My issue (and I admit its my issue) for TV being too consuming was solved. She can still watch TV, she can even still watch cartoons, but she cannot watch cartoons all day long because some channels are locked for a few hours.

He has learned to be critical and sceptical in his thinking, knowing that some game writers take a basis of fact and embellish the truth to make things more dramatic & interesting.  He plays a variety of games, but his passion is in role playing, Lords of the Realm, Age of Mythology, and Age of the Empires. I actually have no problem with him playing these games. But he gets cranky, actually more mad at everyone when he has played these games for more than 30 minutes. He also gets upset because he has to share the computer with his sisters, who are entitled to play the computer as much as he.  He is hoping to rectify the one problem by building a new computer with his grandfather - FANTASTIC!  But still I don&#39;t like living with a grumpy pre-adolescent who is angry at the rest of us for some unknown unjustice. We have talked about it, he<br/>\n  insists he is not angry, nor is he being rude or disrespectful, or mean to the rest of us.  One cannot get far when one cannot admit there is a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Has anyone else experienced this? A negative mood alteration following computer play?
