My DD just asked to eat a bannana.  Once it was peeled, she <br/>\nwanted a knife to cut it up and eat it.  Normally, I would have told <br/>\nher &quot;no&quot; that she might hurt herself and then I would do it for <br/>\nher.  However, after reading the most recent threads with much <br/>\ninterest, I decided to let her do it for herself.  I gave her a <br/>\nbutter knife and a fork.  She proceeded to cut up the bannana and <br/>\neat it with the fork.  She then looked at me and said &quot;look, I did <br/>\nit mommy!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may seem like something small but it was a BIG step for me and I <br/>\nhave all of you to thank for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91499,"nextTopicId":91520}}
