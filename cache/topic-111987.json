He loves to drive anything,<br/>\nso he chose &quot;Need for Speed&quot; and enjoyed it for awhile, but it palled. He&#39;s<br/>\nnot really into racing; he&#39;d rather &quot;park&quot; beside one of the houses in the<br/>\ngame, pull out an old &quot;dead&quot; cellphone that my dh gave him, and make believe<br/>\nthat he&#39;s at his house in real life and he&#39;s talking to a friend about where<br/>\nto go out to eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe plays Animal Crossing for a few minutes at a time, but except for moving<br/>\nfurniture around in his house, he says it&#39;s not very much fun. I think he<br/>\nmostly plays it because my older son does and so do his sister and I. He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like sports games, or Mario or anything with a timer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe says he wants a game where he can have a real life, but not too<br/>\ncomplicated. Basically, I think he wants a house where he can rearrange the<br/>\nfurniture, a car he can drive places like restaurants and stores, and a few<br/>\npeople to interact with . I looked at the Sims series, but it&#39;s way too<br/>\nadvanced for him. He&#39;s 11, but developmentally delayed and very concrete and<br/>\nrigid in his thinking. He also scares easily and doesn&#39;t like anything sad<br/>\nor &quot;dark&quot;, like role-playing games or people dying.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? <br/>\n<br/>\nLil<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Breaking stuff can be a very effective way to learn.&quot; <br/>\n-- Karl Perry <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGraduate<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Graduate+s\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Graduate+s</a><br/>\nchool+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+<br/>\nschool+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+califor<br/>\nnia&c=6&s=181&.sig=XeERtAmMH6xOclFlfF3kXw&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nHigh<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo</a><br/>\nl+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+scho<br/>\nol+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+california&<br/>\nc=6&s=181&.sig=89oOLkTPWnhxf__b2u72QA&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nHome<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo</a><br/>\nl+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+scho<br/>\nol+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+california&<br/>\nc=6&s=181&.sig=1aW-X2S2ZokW3qzZ8RgBsQ&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMiddle<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Middle+school+education&w1=Graduate+sch\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Middle+school+education&w1=Graduate+sch</a><br/>\nool+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+sc<br/>\nhool+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+californi<br/>\na&c=6&s=181&.sig=ekWG86FHE6rjFjd8jaZHOw&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nNew<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=New+york+school+education&w1=Graduate+s\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=New+york+school+education&w1=Graduate+s</a><br/>\nchool+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+<br/>\nschool+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+califor<br/>\nnia&c=6&s=181&.sig=aSJE8BjHS18knvLinwtebQ&gt;  york school education <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=School+education+in+california&w1=Gradu\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=School+education+in+california&w1=Gradu</a><br/>\nate+school+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Mi<br/>\nddle+school+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+ca<br/>\nlifornia&c=6&s=181&.sig=gkGybS6R2TNc7Ffa1FldiA&gt;  education in california <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!

To play with <br/>\nthe boy who likes volleyball you have to go find his ball cuz the neighborhood <br/>\nbully took it.  The whole game is to build up to take back the neighborhood <br/>\nfrom the bully which you don&#39;t see until much later.  The mini games are pretty <br/>\neasy and even if you don&#39;t win, you can do it over and over and walk the <br/>\nstreets and play on the playground and stuff.  It has a larger scope as well, it <br/>\nwas designed to be used online too if you ever wanted to.

In fact, it wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nnecessary for him to keep up with everything all that much... he could<br/>\neven pause the game most of the time and just rearrange stuff.  Also,<br/>\nin Sims (original) if you go to the &quot;Newbie&quot; house and do NOT finish<br/>\nthe tutorial, the people there don&#39;t have their needs drop very fast<br/>\nat all... so it might be a good starting point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s still too advanced, maybe there&#39;s a Maxis product made<br/>\nspecifically for children that he might like.  The only one I have is<br/>\nSimTown, which lets you place houses and activate little &quot;easter eggs&quot;<br/>\nbut no rearranging of stuff inside.  Of course, it&#39;s way to simple to<br/>\nkeep my attention long... but may be something he might enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only other thing that occurred to me was there&#39;s probably some<br/>\nBarbie something that might be close to what he&#39;d like if he wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe offended by the logo (some kids would, others wouldn&#39;t care).  I<br/>\nhave no specific ideas in mind here, just thought that with all the<br/>\nBarbie toys that might match that concept, there&#39;s almost got to be a<br/>\ngame.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, one other thought.  Sims also has a console (PlayStation, etc.)<br/>\nversion out... actually two, Busting Out and Urbz.  It&#39;s possible that<br/>\nthey&#39;ve been simplified enough for the console that he might actually<br/>\nbe able to play those.  And seems to me there might have even been one<br/>\nfor the GameBoy or something which would be even simpler (though that<br/>\nmay have been a different game I&#39;m thinking about).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few thoughts.

He loves to drive anything,<br/>\nso he chose &quot;Need for Speed&quot; and enjoyed it for awhile, but it palled. He&#39;s<br/>\nnot really into racing; he&#39;d rather &quot;park&quot; beside one of the houses in the<br/>\ngame, pull out an old &quot;dead&quot; cellphone that my dh gave him, and make believe<br/>\nthat he&#39;s at his house in real life and he&#39;s talking to a friend about where<br/>\nto go out to eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe plays Animal Crossing for a few minutes at a time, but except for moving<br/>\nfurniture around in his house, he says it&#39;s not very much fun. I think he<br/>\nmostly plays it because my older son does and so do his sister and I. He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like sports games, or Mario or anything with a timer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe says he wants a game where he can have a real life, but not too<br/>\ncomplicated. Basically, I think he wants a house where he can rearrange the<br/>\nfurniture, a car he can drive places like restaurants and stores, and a few<br/>\npeople to interact with . I looked at the Sims series, but it&#39;s way too<br/>\nadvanced for him. He&#39;s 11, but developmentally delayed and very concrete and<br/>\nrigid in his thinking. He also scares easily and doesn&#39;t like anything sad<br/>\nor &quot;dark&quot;, like role-playing games or people dying.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? <br/>\n<br/>\nLil<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Breaking stuff can be a very effective way to learn.&quot; <br/>\n-- Karl Perry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111836,"nextTopicId":112058}}
