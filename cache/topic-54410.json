We <br/>\nput him in good nites pull ups but he soaks them.  Sometimes he gets up, <br/>\nsometimes he doesn&#39;t.  He has horrible itchiness and some rashes from the <br/>\nwetness, or maybe from the chemicals in the pull up.  Any suggestions of <br/>\nnatural overnight protection?  Brands or cotton diaper type pullups to buy <br/>\nand where to get them?  I&#39;d like to try something for the poor kid. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a brand of diapers that is totally natural and biodegradable, made out of corn. They&#39;re called Nature Boy & Girl. You can find them at health food stores but sometimes at other stores too, or order them from drugstore.com. That&#39;s what we&#39;ve used since we switched to disposable diapers. I&#39;ve heard people complain about regular diapers because of rashes and allergic reactions. These diapers are totally friendly to the body and the environment. <br/>\n<br/>\nhere&#39;s their web site: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.norseanatural.com/\">http://www.norseanatural.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Lotus Therapeutics -<br/>\nAyurveda, Homeopathy, Yoga & Therapeutic Massage<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com\">http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDhyanyoga Center of NC -<br/>\nMeditation - Kundalini Maha Yoga<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dyc-nc.org\">http://www.dyc-nc.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\nWhen nothing is done, nothing is left undone.
