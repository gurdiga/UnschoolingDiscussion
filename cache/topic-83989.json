No dressing up; no begging for candy; no handing out<br/>\ncandy (or anything else) If it isn&#39;t, then why make up some<br/>\nbig &quot;baptized&quot; version of it? sheesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree; if Christians are going to define Halloween as evil, they shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave anything to do with it at all.  Doing so &quot;compromises&quot; your belief<br/>\nsystem, in my opinion.  However, so many Christians believe so many<br/>\ndifferent<br/>\nthings, such as total immersion baptism or sprinkling of water - what about<br/>\nbabies<br/>\nbeing baptized?  There&#39;s a hot topic with Christians.  Oh, here&#39; s a really<br/>\nhot<br/>\ntopic-once saved always saved???  I think God looks at our hearts and the<br/>\nintent we have when we commit an act.  The Bible is too conflicting in its&#39;<br/>\nstatements.  You can support each idea by searching through Scriptures and<br/>\ntaking<br/>\nthem out of context-sometimes even in context.  I personally don&#39;t look at<br/>\nHalloween as evil.  To my family, it is just a fun time to dress up and go<br/>\ntrick-or-treating.  And I even let my kids be whatever they want to be,<br/>\nwhether it is<br/>\na witch, a demon, a ghost-whatever.  For this reason, we don&#39;t go to church<br/>\nfall festivals.  If you want to welcome people I don&#39;t believe you can put<br/>\nstipulations on the welcome mat.  At least not at church.  In my own home,<br/>\nI&#39;ll<br/>\ndecide what parameters I want.  As I write that it sounds like a double<br/>\nstandard, but I reason it with &quot;but I&#39;m not God.  I&#39;m not all forgiving and<br/>\nall loving<br/>\nand all accepting.

The author claims that early Christians didn&#39;t<br/>\nconsider the Lord to be God, when early Christians most certainly DID<br/>\nconsider Him to be just that.

(and can&#39;t<br/>\nremember the title. It is a scholarly, historian thing.

I&#39;ll try and remember specifics. The Yule Log was<br/>\none of the &quot;pagan practices&quot; debunked in the book. sheesh. can&#39;t<br/>\nremember, but Christian feast days coming from paganism or not, isn&#39;t<br/>\nmy main point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF Christian traditions come from paganism, my question just takes on<br/>\nmore weight. Why is Halloween evil (and it IS considered evil by many<br/>\nChristians. Take my word on that one. One of my best friends won&#39;t do<br/>\ntrick or treating, and another one completely ignores the day...) Why<br/>\nis All Hallow&#39;s Eve considered evil, and to be shunned, when<br/>\nChristmas and Easter are embraced? IF they come from pagan practices,<br/>\nwe should shun all of it. And in fact, the Reformers and their<br/>\nfollowers DID. Christmas was illegal in Puritan America. The<br/>\nbook &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; was written by the Puritan Daniel Defoe. He<br/>\nmakes a point of ignoring Dec. 25. by having the main character mark<br/>\noff days on his calendar and pointedly having Dec. 25 be just another<br/>\nday, nothing special.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Puritans tried to rename the days of the week, even. Sunday being<br/>\nnamed after the Sun, Monday after the Moon, and so forth. Can&#39;t have<br/>\nTHAT.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Hallowe&#39;en is evil, having come from paganism, then we must follow<br/>\nthrough on our logic and ban other Christian high holy days. But<br/>\ntoday&#39;s Christians don&#39;t follow through. They just consider<br/>\nHallowe&#39;en evil, but only certain parts of it, like trick or<br/>\ntreating. They allow the dressing up and the candy, but ban the trick<br/>\nor treating...or, just put it in the church basement or parking lot.<br/>\nAnd they never think twice about Christmas and Easter or the origin<br/>\nof any other tradition.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, HeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J.

We have gotten grants to pay for some classes<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; materials. We have a permanant meeting place so long term<br/>\ncommitments can be<br/>\n&gt; made. One of my latest thoughts is to try to get appoval to start<br/>\ndrivers ed<br/>\n&gt; classes at the center-in Ohio the kids have to attend a course<br/>\nthrough<br/>\n&gt; school or a private driving school, so why not have a school<br/>\nprogram at the<br/>\n&gt; center so we don&#39;t all have to pay $300 to the local driving<br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe paid over $200 for an insurance-sponsored, profit-driven &quot;driving<br/>\nschool&quot; in Louisiana -- typical, conventional week&#39;s worth of wasted<br/>\ntime.  They insisted that our son should be able to drive on the<br/>\nroad after six hours of instruction to some arbitrary standard (with<br/>\nno other &quot;official&quot; road hours under his belt) -before- issuing a<br/>\nlearner&#39;s permit (you know, the one you get so you can learn how to<br/>\ndrive on the road?) and when he &quot;failed&quot; to meet their so-called<br/>\nstandard, they had the legal right (as a for-profit company offering<br/>\na state-mandated service) to require us to fork over ex-tra bucks<br/>\nfor ex-tra hours from their ex-pert driving instructor.  What a scam!<br/>\n<br/>\nNext time around -- No driver&#39;s ed course required in SC --<br/>\nautodidacts simply pass the written test, which includes some of the<br/>\ndrug & alcohol awareness info, and receive a learner&#39;s permit --<br/>\nthen, proceed to learn to drive on the road under an adult, licensed<br/>\ndriver&#39;s supervision (you know, like the old days when your parents<br/>\nsat by your side and took part in the process as a matter of course -<br/>\n- white knuckles notwithstanding.)  Common sense and a lot of love<br/>\nkept them in the passenger&#39;s seat till they were confident in our<br/>\nability to steer clear of trouble.  Those were the days, my friend...<br/>\n<br/>\nHere we are in FL -- mandated Traffic Law & Substance Abuse course,<br/>\nreasonable priced (under $50) and even available in a convenient<br/>\nonline version.  Major problem -- the course content on substance<br/>\nabuse is highly objectionable (nightmarish to those who have gone<br/>\nthrough the trauma of losing loved ones to DUI) and in conflict with<br/>\nour sincerely-held religious beliefs and educational philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave contacted the HSMV and State Representatives for information on<br/>\na waiver (for the objectionable part of the course, if not all), but<br/>\nno go.

Any dictionary with<br/>\netymologies or a google search for the etymology of &quot;Easter&quot;:  NOT Christian<br/>\norigin.  &lt;&lt;<br/>\n**********************<br/>\nThis is how I have always understood All Souls (Saints) Day.  As the<br/>\nCatholic<br/>\nChurch expanded, they moved into countries that had Pagan celebrations at<br/>\nvarious times of the year.  As locals (especially peasants) came to accept<br/>\nthe<br/>\nChurch (yes, I&#39;m sure it was forced on many) they began to mesh their own<br/>\nPagan<br/>\nbeliefs with Catholic beliefs.  Rather than have an all out rebellion, the<br/>\nChurch said, &quot;OK, you celebrate death and the dead this time of year, you<br/>\nbelieve<br/>\ndead souls come back to earth at this time, let&#39;s just call it &#39;All Souls&#39;<br/>\n(November 1st) and we&#39;ll honor all the saints and dead that have come before<br/>\nus,<br/>\npray for them, and ask them to pray for us.&quot;  Halloween = All Hallow&#39;s<br/>\n(saint&#39;s) Eve = Hallow&#39;s eve = Hallow &#39;een.  Things Pagan remained on the<br/>\nnight<br/>\nbefore, (carved and lighted turnips - pumpkins now), dead coming back to<br/>\nroam,<br/>\netc, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Yes, about celebrating the resurrection.<br/>\nNo on &quot;Easter&quot; being of Christian origin.  When they stuck it on that<br/>\nweekend, they kept the old name (in England--I don&#39;t know what they call it<br/>\nin other<br/>\nlanguages).&lt;&lt;<br/>\n*******************************************<br/>\nI think Easter came from the name &quot;Ostre&quot; who was a fertility goddess.<br/>\nHence, the eggs (fertility), rabbits (fertility), etc.  Another case of<br/>\npagan and<br/>\nChristian mixing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost every &quot;Christian&quot; holiday was meshed with pagan beliefs.<br/>\nChristmas..Christ was not born in the winter, but pagans had a huge<br/>\n&quot;winterfest&quot; (Yule)<br/>\nwhich celebrated the winter equinox (I think?).  They burned part of the<br/>\nyule<br/>\nlog from the year before, they held holly as a sign of eternal life (doesn&#39;t<br/>\ndie<br/>\nin the winter),...I think even mistletoe began as a pagan tradition!  Again,<br/>\nthe Church basically said, &quot;OK, keep your festival, but can we instead &#39;say&#39;<br/>\nwe&#39;re celebrating Christ&#39;s birth?  That&#39;ll make it OK.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, even Birthday cakes started as a gift to idols and &quot;gods&quot; originally.<br/>\nNot sure what a burning cake represented, but it started pagan!<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 18<br/>\n   Date: Thu, 6 Nov 2003 00:43:39 EST<br/>\n   From: SandraDodd@...<br/>\nSubject: Re: Digest Number 4163<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 11/5/03 9:22:37 PM, jnjstau@... writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Actually, there are quite a few historians who do believe that the<br/>\nChristian<br/>\n<br/>\nfestivals are based on the Pagan festivals, &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen there was a chance to commandeer an existing tradition they did so.<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean things like All Saint&#39;s Day and All Hallow&#39;s Eve aren&#39;t<br/>\nChristian holidays.

No dressing up; no begging for candy; no handing out<br/>\ncandy (or anything else) If it isn&#39;t, then why make up some<br/>\nbig &quot;baptized&quot; version of it? sheesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree; if Christians are going to define Halloween as evil, they shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave anything to do with it at all.  Doing so &quot;compromises&quot; your belief<br/>\nsystem, in my opinion.  However, so many Christians believe so many<br/>\ndifferent<br/>\nthings, such as total immersion baptism or sprinkling of water - what about<br/>\nbabies<br/>\nbeing baptized?  There&#39;s a hot topic with Christians.  Oh, here&#39; s a really<br/>\nhot<br/>\ntopic-once saved always saved???  I think God looks at our hearts and the<br/>\nintent we have when we commit an act.  The Bible is too conflicting in its&#39;<br/>\nstatements.  You can support each idea by searching through Scriptures and<br/>\ntaking<br/>\nthem out of context-sometimes even in context.  I personally don&#39;t look at<br/>\nHalloween as evil.  To my family, it is just a fun time to dress up and go<br/>\ntrick-or-treating.  And I even let my kids be whatever they want to be,<br/>\nwhether it is<br/>\na witch, a demon, a ghost-whatever.  For this reason, we don&#39;t go to church<br/>\nfall festivals.  If you want to welcome people I don&#39;t believe you can put<br/>\nstipulations on the welcome mat.  At least not at church.  In my own home,<br/>\nI&#39;ll<br/>\ndecide what parameters I want.  As I write that it sounds like a double<br/>\nstandard, but I reason it with &quot;but I&#39;m not God.  I&#39;m not all forgiving and<br/>\nall loving<br/>\nand all accepting.  I&#39;m not willing to die on the cross for the entire<br/>\nworld.&quot;  Does that make sense, or am I making excuses?<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 7<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 05 Nov 2003 21:40:53 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;Heidi&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: on candy and other  limits<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah!

He cites The<br/>\nGnostic Gospels with as much veracity as valid historical documents,<br/>\nwhen the earliest copies of the Gnostic Gospels are dated in the 4th<br/>\ncentury or later. The author claims that early Christians didn&#39;t<br/>\nconsider the Lord to be God, when early Christians most certainly DID<br/>\nconsider Him to be just that. I enjoyed reading The DaVinci Code, but<br/>\nit isn&#39;t an historical treatise by anyone&#39;s measure, and it really<br/>\nisn&#39;t all that well written.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for all these Christian holidays coming out of Paganism...<br/>\nactually, I have read a book that refutes this notion. (and can&#39;t<br/>\nremember the title. It is a scholarly, historian thing. Like, a PhD<br/>\nthesis or something. 500 pages + ) The Reformers wanted Christians to<br/>\nmake a clean break from R Catholicism; therefore, they stigmatized<br/>\nvarious Catholic practices by saying they came from paganism.<br/>\nAccording to this essay, archaeological data indicates that many of<br/>\nthese traditions didn&#39;t come into practice until after Christianity<br/>\ngot into an area. I&#39;ll try and remember specifics. The Yule Log was<br/>\none of the &quot;pagan practices&quot; debunked in the book. sheesh. can&#39;t<br/>\nremember, but Christian feast days coming from paganism or not, isn&#39;t<br/>\nmy main point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF Christian traditions come from paganism, my question just takes on<br/>\nmore weight. Why is Halloween evil (and it IS considered evil by many<br/>\nChristians. Take my word on that one. One of my best friends won&#39;t do<br/>\ntrick or treating, and another one completely ignores the day...) Why<br/>\nis All Hallow&#39;s Eve considered evil, and to be shunned, when<br/>\nChristmas and Easter are embraced? IF they come from pagan practices,<br/>\nwe should shun all of it. And in fact, the Reformers and their<br/>\nfollowers DID. Christmas was illegal in Puritan America. The<br/>\nbook &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; was written by the Puritan Daniel Defoe. He<br/>\nmakes a point of ignoring Dec. 25. by having the main character mark<br/>\noff days on his calendar and pointedly having Dec. 25 be just another<br/>\nday, nothing special.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Puritans tried to rename the days of the week, even. Sunday being<br/>\nnamed after the Sun, Monday after the Moon, and so forth. Can&#39;t have<br/>\nTHAT.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Hallowe&#39;en is evil, having come from paganism, then we must follow<br/>\nthrough on our logic and ban other Christian high holy days. But<br/>\ntoday&#39;s Christians don&#39;t follow through. They just consider<br/>\nHallowe&#39;en evil, but only certain parts of it, like trick or<br/>\ntreating. They allow the dressing up and the candy, but ban the trick<br/>\nor treating...or, just put it in the church basement or parking lot.<br/>\nAnd they never think twice about Christmas and Easter or the origin<br/>\nof any other tradition.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, HeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J.

One of my latest thoughts is to try to get appoval to start<br/>\ndrivers ed<br/>\n&gt; classes at the center-in Ohio the kids have to attend a course<br/>\nthrough<br/>\n&gt; school or a private driving school, so why not have a school<br/>\nprogram at the<br/>\n&gt; center so we don&#39;t all have to pay $300 to the local driving<br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe paid over $200 for an insurance-sponsored, profit-driven &quot;driving<br/>\nschool&quot; in Louisiana -- typical, conventional week&#39;s worth of wasted<br/>\ntime.  They insisted that our son should be able to drive on the<br/>\nroad after six hours of instruction to some arbitrary standard (with<br/>\nno other &quot;official&quot; road hours under his belt) -before- issuing a<br/>\nlearner&#39;s permit (you know, the one you get so you can learn how to<br/>\ndrive on the road?) and when he &quot;failed&quot; to meet their so-called<br/>\nstandard, they had the legal right (as a for-profit company offering<br/>\na state-mandated service) to require us to fork over ex-tra bucks<br/>\nfor ex-tra hours from their ex-pert driving instructor.  What a scam!<br/>\n<br/>\nNext time around -- No driver&#39;s ed course required in SC --<br/>\nautodidacts simply pass the written test, which includes some of the<br/>\ndrug & alcohol awareness info, and receive a learner&#39;s permit --<br/>\nthen, proceed to learn to drive on the road under an adult, licensed<br/>\ndriver&#39;s supervision (you know, like the old days when your parents<br/>\nsat by your side and took part in the process as a matter of course -<br/>\n- white knuckles notwithstanding.)

Those were the days, my friend...<br/>\n<br/>\nHere we are in FL -- mandated Traffic Law & Substance Abuse course,<br/>\nreasonable priced (under $50) and even available in a convenient<br/>\nonline version.

As the<br/>\nCatholic<br/>\nChurch expanded, they moved into countries that had Pagan celebrations at<br/>\nvarious times of the year.  As locals (especially peasants) came to accept<br/>\nthe<br/>\nChurch (yes, I&#39;m sure it was forced on many) they began to mesh their own<br/>\nPagan<br/>\nbeliefs with Catholic beliefs.  Rather than have an all out rebellion, the<br/>\nChurch said, &quot;OK, you celebrate death and the dead this time of year, you<br/>\nbelieve<br/>\ndead souls come back to earth at this time, let&#39;s just call it &#39;All Souls&#39;<br/>\n(November 1st) and we&#39;ll honor all the saints and dead that have come before<br/>\nus,<br/>\npray for them, and ask them to pray for us.&quot;  Halloween = All Hallow&#39;s<br/>\n(saint&#39;s) Eve = Hallow&#39;s eve = Hallow &#39;een.

When they stuck it on that<br/>\nweekend, they kept the old name (in England--I don&#39;t know what they call it<br/>\nin other<br/>\nlanguages).&lt;&lt;<br/>\n*******************************************<br/>\nI think Easter came from the name &quot;Ostre&quot; who was a fertility goddess.<br/>\nHence, the eggs (fertility), rabbits (fertility), etc.  Another case of<br/>\npagan and<br/>\nChristian mixing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost every &quot;Christian&quot; holiday was meshed with pagan beliefs.<br/>\nChristmas..Christ was not born in the winter, but pagans had a huge<br/>\n&quot;winterfest&quot; (Yule)<br/>\nwhich celebrated the winter equinox (I think?).  They burned part of the<br/>\nyule<br/>\nlog from the year before, they held holly as a sign of eternal life (doesn&#39;t<br/>\ndie<br/>\nin the winter),...I think even mistletoe began as a pagan tradition!  Again,<br/>\nthe Church basically said, &quot;OK, keep your festival, but can we instead &#39;say&#39;<br/>\nwe&#39;re celebrating Christ&#39;s birth?  That&#39;ll make it OK.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, even Birthday cakes started as a gift to idols and &quot;gods&quot; originally.<br/>\nNot sure what a burning cake represented, but it started pagan!<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 18<br/>\n   Date: Thu, 6 Nov 2003 00:43:39 EST<br/>\n   From: SandraDodd@...<br/>\nSubject: Re: Digest Number 4163<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 11/5/03 9:22:37 PM, jnjstau@... writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Actually, there are quite a few historians who do believe that the<br/>\nChristian<br/>\n<br/>\nfestivals are based on the Pagan festivals, &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen there was a chance to commandeer an existing tradition they did so.<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean things like All Saint&#39;s Day and All Hallow&#39;s Eve aren&#39;t<br/>\nChristian holidays.
