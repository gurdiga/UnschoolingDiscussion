One <br/>\nwas an old beatup briefcase - junky, but it was my dad&#39;s and I couldn&#39;t bring <br/>\nmyself to toss it out. It sat out in the living room for a few weeks and then <br/>\nI accepted reality that I was NOT going to get rid of it and I stuck it on a <br/>\nway-high hard-to-reach shelf out of sight. There it sat for about 8 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, one day I took it down and opened it and guess what was in it? Yep - <br/>\nthe MISSING TV remote control --- missing since my then-10 yo daughter was <br/>\nTWO YEARS OLD &lt;G&gt;. She&#39;s now almost 18 and we still have the tv and still <br/>\nhave that remote and I think about her putting it in that briefcase, her <br/>\nlittle two-year-old fingers struggling with those latches---opening them, <br/>\nputting the remote control inside, carefully closing the old latches --- <br/>\nevery time I use it. And that reminds me of my dad, who died when she was <br/>\nonly two and before my other kids were even born and I think how he&#39;d just <br/>\ncrack UP at how we turned the house inside out looking for that remote <br/>\ncontrol and there it was, safely in his briefcase all that time.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":257127,"authorName":"Deb","from":"Deb &lt;herbtea@...&gt;","profile":"live_oak2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2236","postDate":"1029220287","msgId":40873,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNENThBN0JGLkVGRDFGOTVAZ3RlLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwMjkyMTQ5MTkuMTQyMi41MTA3Lm01QHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":40907,"prevInTime":40872,"nextInTime":40874,"topicId":40873,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks, Sandra.
