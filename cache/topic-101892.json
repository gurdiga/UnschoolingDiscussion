I guess as a teacher (even one who is disillusioned<br/>\nwith institutional education) I have a ways to go to get out of the<br/>\nwhole teaching mentality.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-I wondered if there are any resources or discussion lists<br/>\nspecifically<br/>\n<br/>\nabout unschooling academically �gifted� children, or if there is any<br/>\n<br/>\ndifference at all. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there are lists about academically gifted children, out the<br/>\nwazoo.<br/>\nI&#39;m sure unschooling works the same way regardless.<br/>\nI&#39;m positive that those labels do as much harm as others.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[***] Really? I haven&#39;t told my kids they are &quot;gifted&quot;; but I do tell<br/>\nthem they&#39;re brilliant, and smart and that they blow me away when they<br/>\ndo.  What is harmful about that (not meant to be snarky, I am curious as<br/>\nto your opinion)?  I also tell them they are adorable, and that they are<br/>\nsweet, or generous or caring or however I perceive them acting at the<br/>\ntime.

Obviously they will pick it up on their own, but what&#39;s<br/>\nwrong with praising their strengths?  I don&#39;t tell them they are smarter<br/>\nthan everyone else or anything, but I do compliment them on the way they<br/>\nthink, their creativity, etc. when appropriate.

Rather than looking for things for the kids to do, find<br/>\nthings for *you* to do.  My kids know they can throw themselves 100%<br/>\ninto a project or an interest because all their lives they&#39;ve seen<br/>\ntheir parents do it. **<br/>\n<br/>\nSome days I spend hours working on my quilting projects.  I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nthat this time isn&#39;t mis-spent.  I could instead spend those hours <br/>\nwatching what he is watching on TV, or driving him places, or surfing or <br/>\nshopping to find more cool stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould it be more beneficial if I switched interests frequently, rather <br/>\nthan being deeply interested in one thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nI got interested in the American Revolution this fall and read five or <br/>\nsix books on the topic.  Some of them were books on tape, but he mostly <br/>\nwasn&#39;t in the same room any of that time.  Yeah, sometimes I would pop <br/>\nmy head out and shout to my husband &quot;You&#39;ll never believe what they said <br/>\nabout the Aaron Burr duel&quot;, so, yes, there was some spillover from my <br/>\ninterests into my son&#39;s ears.  And if the topic comes up, I have lots <br/>\nmore knowledge to share, now.  But I don&#39;t see my interests directly <br/>\ninspiring him.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Sharing : Ms. magazine, Fall issue, has a great article on the <br/>\n&quot;founding father&#39;s&quot; attitudes towards religion and what they had to say <br/>\nabout church & state.  Tends to refute what the radical religious right <br/>\nhas been claiming.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was very interested in the Presidential Election and discussed <br/>\npolitical issues in front of my son fairly frequently and answered his <br/>\nquestions.  I&#39;m sure I gave him a biased view!  (I think he did learn at <br/>\nlot from this.  And since we watch The Daily Show, he can lip-read most <br/>\nswear words. &lt;g&gt;)  Oh!  I&#39;m reading a cool book,  _The Republican Noise <br/>\nMachine_, which dates fear of the liberal media back to the Nixon <br/>\nadministration.  Yes, that man did NOT like criticism.<br/>\n<br/>\nJames did get involved in gardening with us recently.  He likes the <br/>\ntaste-testing segments when I watch America&#39;s Test Kitchen.  So, prior <br/>\nto planting a citrus tree, we had a citrus tasting and planted the one <br/>\nhe thought tasted best (Clementine).  He was enthusiastic about planting <br/>\nthat.  We have a break in the rain today, and I&#39;d like to go to the <br/>\nnursery today to buy herb plants.  It would be nice if James wanted to <br/>\ncome with me, so my husband could come, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n** If beautiful handwriting is important to you, get a caligraphy set<br/>\nand *you* learn to write beautifully**<br/>\n<br/>\n(OK, here&#39;s the part where I start to sound desperate.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(I can do calligraphy although I haven&#39;t demonstrated it for my child much.)<br/>\nThe issue isn&#39;t &quot;beautiful&quot; handwriting, it&#39;s the ability to write at <br/>\nall.  He can make scraggly letters, but has written so little that he <br/>\nhas trouble remembering how all of the letters are formed.  The amount <br/>\nof writing that he has done spontaneously is not more than 10 <br/>\n*characters* at a time.  (maybe three words) and FAR less than 100 <br/>\n*characters* per year.  (More like 50 or 60 single charcters in a <br/>\nyear.)  It&#39;s difficult for me to wait for him to want to write.  Right <br/>\nnow it seems that IF he had something he wanted to write, he couldn&#39;t do <br/>\nit.  (He has never shown much interest in drawing.)  Could he really not <br/>\nbe developmentally able to do this?  That was my theory when he was 7 <br/>\nand 8, but it&#39;s sounding thin now that he is almost 11.

We <br/>\nhave another trip to the Museum of Radio and Television booked for next <br/>\nweek - the kids LOVED that one, last time we went here. We&#39;re going to <br/>\nsee the King Tut exhibit - have to book months ahead for that. I was <br/>\nJUST sitting here thinking that I&#39;d like to set up a camping trip to <br/>\nthe desert in the spring. Tomorrow night we might go spend the night on <br/>\nthe streets of Pasadena and watch the Rose parade in the morning IF the <br/>\nrain stops early enough in the afternoon. I ask my kids to play games <br/>\nwith me all the time.  I happened to find a little quilt-making kit in <br/>\nsome old craft supplies and I took that out and offered it to Rosie. My <br/>\npoint is that I am doing a lot of the &quot;initiating&quot; around here - but <br/>\nthe kids are doing far more of it now than they did at 10 or 11 years <br/>\nold.<br/>\n<br/>\nNONE of my initiating is designed to directly or indirectly get the <br/>\nkids to learn something like handwriting or math. They are always <br/>\nexperiences that I think are likely to be enjoyed for their own sakes, <br/>\nnot as a means to an end.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot everybody likes to be on the go as much as we have been over the <br/>\nyears. We&#39;re slowing down these days - enjoying long days at home. Here <br/>\nin Southern California we don&#39;t have weather to keep us in and there <br/>\nare so MANY cool things to do - we sometimes overdo it. I have started <br/>\nto be the one to say, &quot;How about we don&#39;t make any plans for Friday - <br/>\njust stay home and putter around?&quot; This is still me doing the <br/>\ninitiating.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I didn&#39;t find out about things and tell my kids about opportunities, <br/>\nthey wouldn&#39;t do 1/10th as much as what they do choose to do.So, the <br/>\nanswer is, yes, I think the unschooling parent&#39;s role is to act as a <br/>\nresource person.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT - the goal is a satisfyingly-immersed-in-life present - not finding <br/>\nways to sort of trick a kid into learning something.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":135609248,"authorName":"julie w","from":"julie w &lt;jjjwoolfolk@...&gt;","profile":"juliewinar","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: .RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Doing too little?

It certainly feels uncomfortable when the child isn&#39;t <br/>\nbubbling over with suggestions, and spends big chunks of time on the <br/>\ncouch.  But for me, when hearing the advice not to push a school <br/>\ncurriculum, I tend to overreact and think that I shouldn&#39;t promote <br/>\nanything, unless my child is already interested in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it wrong or unhelpful to strew things that are very schooly, or even <br/>\na little bit schooly?  Is it reasonable to promote nonfiction as a <br/>\nbalance to lots and lots of fantasy and gaming?  Or is that just <br/>\nwrongheaded?<br/>\n<br/>\nWorries about math (natch), and science facts and handwriting and <br/>\ngeography are nibbling me.  Most of my friends with kids the same age <br/>\nare eclectic homeschoolers, with daughters who are brilliantly bookish.  <br/>\n(One nine year old reads Shakespeare, and the others cut from the same <br/>\ncloth.  It&#39;s unreasonable to expect him to be just like them, but they <br/>\nare the kids that I hear about most.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPhilosophically I&#39;m trying to answer the question &quot;Should I row the boat <br/>\nmore, or should I just let it drift downstream?&quot;  Are there other <br/>\nchoices?  Should he be holding his own (metaphorical) oars?  (He&#39;s ten <br/>\ngoing on eleven.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve talked, in the past, that the middle years can be discouraging in <br/>\nunschooling.  If the kid isn&#39;t passionately pursuing something that <br/>\nlooks braggably academic, then he can seem &quot;behind&quot; his schooled and <br/>\nhomeschooled peers who are being pushed into learning.  But his <br/>\nenthusiasm for learning and his ownership of his own mind are being kept <br/>\nalive, and that&#39;s important to me.  I&#39;m just not feeling very <br/>\ncomfortable with &quot;behindness&quot; and seeing such slow progress on things <br/>\nlike handwriting, I&#39;m having a hard time believing that what he needs <br/>\nwill eventually develop.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this feels too abstract and self-indulgent, then feel free to let it go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think moving two years ago has been a setback for us.  There is only a <br/>\ntiny support group here in town, so we aren&#39;t swept along into <br/>\nactivities because our friends are doing them.  For me, going to the <br/>\npark alone and going to the museum alone aren&#39;t any fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can I do that is positive?  Is this process dependent on me doing <br/>\nmore?  Or is &quot;being&quot; more important than &quot;doing&quot;?  Would encouraging him <br/>\nto practice handwriting directly, or indirectly, be harmful, beneficial, <br/>\nneutral, or a waste of money?  I feel like I should be able to figure <br/>\nthis out by myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201330991,"authorName":"Queana","from":"&quot;Queana&quot; &lt;queana7@...&gt;","profile":"queanabruedal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: .RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Unschooling and &quot;gifted&quot; children (long)","postDate":"1104433003","msgId":101931,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTAwMWM0ZWVhMSQ1MGViMjZiMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBDQVZBTEFQVE9QPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQxNzkxMzQyLTVBN0QtMTFEOS1BNzlFLTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":101930,"nextInTopic":101941,"prevInTime":101930,"nextInTime":101932,"topicId":101892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I remember when I used to read the<br/>\ntcs (Taking Children Seriously) list for a few years, the mantra was<br/>\nrepeated frequently that tcs was very different from neglect, that<br/>\ntypical parenting is often neglect, and that tcs is extremely hands on.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though this is not tcs, it seems pretty similar in many ways.  I<br/>\nknow the reaction to people who want to control their child&#39;s every<br/>\nwaking moment is to tell them to leave the poor kid alone.  Let them<br/>\nwatch tv, let them play games, etc.  I&#39;m probably not the only one who<br/>\nhas gotten the impression that unschooling meant much less hands on<br/>\nparenting than is actually true.  It seems to me that unschooling would<br/>\nrequire more time and dedication from the parent even than traditional<br/>\nschool-at-home, since that has time boundaries and specific objectives<br/>\nand assessments.  In reading the articles on the unschooling.com website<br/>\nit is obvious that this type of approach (hands on, brain on) is<br/>\nrecommended, but sometimes in just reading the message boards and email<br/>\nlists it can seem that a hands-off approach *is* unschooling.

THat&#39;s nasty), but anyway, Today, the<br/>\nbaby had been up all night teething and I was tired,<br/>\nbut fixed the kids breakfast and my oldest Apsu (3.5<br/>\nyrs) said &quot;how do ya do?&quot; (a little game that we play<br/>\nand I said just fine how do you do?

Do they have teachers now that can<br/>\nhelp them learn these things, or are they sitting around bored out of<br/>\ntheir minds while their classmates do stuff they mastered years ago?<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing the latter.<br/>\n <br/>\nRight!  This is exactly why we are quitting school.  They have been in a<br/>\nprivate school which has been better academically than the surrounding<br/>\npublic schools, but still very stifling and boring!  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is the only option that will let your kids learn what they<br/>\nwant to learn, when they want to learn it. Every other educational<br/>\noption is about controlling the pace and content of their learning to<br/>\na lesser or greater extent. You don&#39;t have to know everything they<br/>\nwant to know. Unschooling isn&#39;t about transferring the contents of<br/>\nyour head into theirs. It&#39;s about helping them explore the world in<br/>\nthe way they want to explore it. Google (the search engine, not<br/>\n&quot;googol&quot; the amazingly high number) is your friend; so is the library.<br/>\nSo are all the people around you who know different stuff than you --<br/>\nlike your friend who speaks Spanish. If your child was dying to learn<br/>\nSpanish and is enjoying the help your friend is giving him, fantastic!<br/>\nIf he isn&#39;t enjoying it, you can help him find another resource that<br/>\nwill help him. Another Spanish speaker, or a computer program, or a<br/>\ntrip to Mexico, or CD lessons that you both listen to in the car . . .<br/>\nyou can use your imagination. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t about never doing &quot;lessons&quot; or taking classes or<br/>\ndoing anything that looks like something that might be done in school,<br/>\nit&#39;s about kids being in control of their own lives and learning. You<br/>\nare the person who can help them with the practical details of<br/>\nbrainstorming ways to find out what they want, providing<br/>\ntransportation and materials, searching for things on the computer or<br/>\nlibrary or phone book if they aren&#39;t up to it, making phone calls to<br/>\npeople they might not have the social skills to deal with yet, paying<br/>\nfor stuff :) or helping them come up with ways to finance what is not<br/>\nin your budget that is important to them. It&#39;s about giving your 9<br/>\nyear old permission to sit for six hours straight programming C++ (if<br/>\nthat&#39;s what he wants) instead of making him stop and learn his<br/>\nspelling words. It&#39;s about giving them the freedom and the *power* to<br/>\nbe themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for this!  I sometimes wonder if what I envision is actually<br/>\nunschooling because sometimes it can sound like I should leave them<br/>\nalone entirely and let them find ways to teach themselves things that<br/>\nthey happen across.  Obviously I would never do this but I have somehow<br/>\ngotten that impression from some unschoolers.  What you describe above<br/>\nis exactly what I imagine life to be like next year.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing -- once you start unschooling, you will probably find it<br/>\nless and less necessary to think of your kids as &quot;gifted.&quot; It&#39;s a<br/>\nlabel I used reluctantly when my son was in school and now just don&#39;t<br/>\nfeel a need for at all. It&#39;s a label like ADD that makes sense in the<br/>\ncontext of school, where they are trying to standardize kids and<br/>\nanyone who is more resistant to standardization needs to be placed (at<br/>\nleast mentally) in another group to make the lives of teachers and<br/>\nadministrators easier. All unschoolers need to worry about is letting<br/>\ntheir kids be *themselves.* Comparing them to anyone else is not only<br/>\npointless, it&#39;s just not necessary. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I find amazing about unschooling is the realization of how<br/>\nextremely individual kids are, much more than is acknowledged in<br/>\nschool, where kids just tend to be thought of as &quot;the brainy one,&quot;<br/>\n&quot;the jock,&quot; &quot;the artistic one.&quot; It&#39;s more likely, in my experience, to<br/>\nbe something like &quot;the one who&#39;s really obsessed with really high<br/>\nnumbers right now and is dying to learn Spanish and watches the Star<br/>\nWars movies over and over and can sit for three hours playing with<br/>\npattern blocks but next year he&#39;ll be obsessed with marine life and be<br/>\ndying to play role playing games with his older brother and read the<br/>\nTom Swift books over and over and sit around making up secret codes<br/>\nfor hours on end.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, kids have really specific interests and needs, which<br/>\nare constantly changing, and I find that it&#39;s more helpful to think in<br/>\nterms of how to help them with the specifics of what they want right<br/>\nnow -- whether it&#39;s a way to learn Spanish or a cool computer game or<br/>\na glass of juice :) -- rather than to think in grandiose terms of<br/>\nproviding all the intellectual enrichment they will ever need for the<br/>\nrest of their lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has!

I do have a<br/>\nson who attend grades k-5 in public school where they classified him as<br/>\n&quot;gifted&quot;, and he was placed in GATE (gifted and talented program).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our case, we don&#39;t do anything differently because he was titled<br/>\n&quot;gifted&quot;.  I also a daughter who was always &quot;below grade level&quot; -- and we<br/>\ndon&#39;t do anything differently with her.  I really don&#39;t think unschooling is<br/>\nabout titles such as that.  And actually, I can&#39;t stand even using these<br/>\ntitles/descriptions anymore.  We literally have child-led learning in our<br/>\nhome and that is what we do.  No labels....we just have kids who love to<br/>\nlearn, who are learning in everything they do.  My son loves math and<br/>\nhistory.  He literally sits and watches the history channel for a couple<br/>\nhours every single night.    He is starting to pass me up when it comes to<br/>\nmath -- but that doesn&#39;t scare me.  I am really not his teacher...I am a<br/>\ntour guide who helps him to get where he wants to go.  In this time and age,<br/>\nwe have the world wide web full of resources.  Libraries full of books.  Not<br/>\nto mention all of the other ways he can learn math from our real life<br/>\nsituations.  He has expressed an interest in taking college math courses<br/>\nsoon (he is 12), and I fully support that.  He does appear more &quot;scholarly&quot;<br/>\nthan my daughter -- she&#39;s much more artistic than him.  But that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nchanges what happens in our home.  In our home they just live life.  They<br/>\npursue what is important to them and what interests them.  I just think that<br/>\nwhen you truly see it from this simple view, the matters of being &quot;gifted&quot;<br/>\nor not, just don&#39;t matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Brandie~~<br/>\nhttp://www.scrapbookingwithbrandie.com<br/>\nhttp://scrapblogging.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Queana&quot; &lt;queana7@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;unschoolingdiscussion@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, December 29, 2004 12:38 PM<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Unschooling and &quot;gifted&quot; children<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been on the list for the recommended couple weeks before posting,<br/>\nand have been on this list in the past.  I don&#39;t believe I have ever<br/>\nseen this discussed.<br/>\nI realize that all children are gifted in various ways.  I have children<br/>\nwho happen to be gifted in ways that would be considered academic or<br/>\nschoolish I guess.  They have always been in school.  We will be<br/>\nhomeschooling them next year, and I am considering unschooling.  I know<br/>\nthat it is my responsibility to expose them to things that they are<br/>\ninterested in, or that I think they might become interested in.  I<br/>\nalready know many of their interests and passions, since they have<br/>\ntaught themselves most of what they know anyway; they certainly haven&#39;t<br/>\nlearned it in school.<br/>\nI wondered if there are any resources or discussion lists specifically<br/>\nabout unschooling academically &quot;gifted&quot; children, or if there is any<br/>\ndifference at all.  I want to start preparing now, and gathering<br/>\nresources, but I would like some input from others who are experienced<br/>\nwith this particular area. Any book recommendations?<br/>\n            I also wondered how I would be able to keep up with them in<br/>\nan unschooling setting.  For example, my 5 year old has already<br/>\nexhausted my knowledge of place values (I only know up to 100<br/>\ndectillion, and then googol and googol plex and I&#39;m a math teacher by<br/>\ntrade lol) and counting in various languages.  My 9 year old is learning<br/>\nvisual c++ which I can&#39;t help with.  Am I setting myself for failure?  I<br/>\nknow I&#39;m smart, but how can I possibly help them learn everything they<br/>\nwant to learn?  Is it unschooling to let them have lessons that they ask<br/>\nfor in certain areas?

You<br/>\nare the person who can help them with the practical details of<br/>\nbrainstorming ways to find out what they want, providing<br/>\ntransportation and materials, searching for things on the computer or<br/>\nlibrary or phone book if they aren&#39;t up to it, making phone calls to<br/>\npeople they might not have the social skills to deal with yet, paying<br/>\nfor stuff :) or helping them come up with ways to finance what is not<br/>\nin your budget that is important to them. It&#39;s about giving your 9<br/>\nyear old permission to sit for six hours straight programming C++ (if<br/>\nthat&#39;s what he wants) instead of making him stop and learn his<br/>\nspelling words. It&#39;s about giving them the freedom and the *power* to<br/>\nbe themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing -- once you start unschooling, you will probably find it<br/>\nless and less necessary to think of your kids as &quot;gifted.&quot; It&#39;s a<br/>\nlabel I used reluctantly when my son was in school and now just don&#39;t<br/>\nfeel a need for at all. It&#39;s a label like ADD that makes sense in the<br/>\ncontext of school, where they are trying to standardize kids and<br/>\nanyone who is more resistant to standardization needs to be placed (at<br/>\nleast mentally) in another group to make the lives of teachers and<br/>\nadministrators easier. All unschoolers need to worry about is letting<br/>\ntheir kids be *themselves.* Comparing them to anyone else is not only<br/>\npointless, it&#39;s just not necessary. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I find amazing about unschooling is the realization of how<br/>\nextremely individual kids are, much more than is acknowledged in<br/>\nschool, where kids just tend to be thought of as &quot;the brainy one,&quot;<br/>\n&quot;the jock,&quot; &quot;the artistic one.&quot; It&#39;s more likely, in my experience, to<br/>\nbe something like &quot;the one who&#39;s really obsessed with really high<br/>\nnumbers right now and is dying to learn Spanish and watches the Star<br/>\nWars movies over and over and can sit for three hours playing with<br/>\npattern blocks but next year he&#39;ll be obsessed with marine life and be<br/>\ndying to play role playing games with his older brother and read the<br/>\nTom Swift books over and over and sit around making up secret codes<br/>\nfor hours on end.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, kids have really specific interests and needs, which<br/>\nare constantly changing, and I find that it&#39;s more helpful to think in<br/>\nterms of how to help them with the specifics of what they want right<br/>\nnow -- whether it&#39;s a way to learn Spanish or a cool computer game or<br/>\na glass of juice :) -- rather than to think in grandiose terms of<br/>\nproviding all the intellectual enrichment they will ever need for the<br/>\nrest of their lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201330991,"authorName":"Queana","from":"&quot;Queana&quot; &lt;queana7@...&gt;","profile":"queanabruedal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Unschooling and &quot;gifted&quot; children","postDate":"1104341898","msgId":101892,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjUwMWM0ZWRjZCQzMjE2YTU0MCQ2NTAxYThjMEBDQVZBTEFQVE9QPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":101897,"prevInTime":101891,"nextInTime":101893,"topicId":101892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have been on the list for the recommended couple weeks before posting, and have been on this list in the past.

I don�t believe I have ever<br/>\nseen this discussed.<br/>\nI realize that all children are gifted in various ways.  I have children<br/>\nwho happen to be gifted in ways that would be considered academic or<br/>\nschoolish I guess.  They have always been in school.  We will be<br/>\nhomeschooling them next year, and I am considering unschooling.  I know<br/>\nthat it is my responsibility to expose them to things that they are<br/>\ninterested in, or that I think they might become interested in.  I<br/>\nalready know many of their interests and passions, since they have<br/>\ntaught themselves most of what they know anyway; they certainly haven�t<br/>\nlearned it in school.  <br/>\nI wondered if there are any resources or discussion lists specifically<br/>\nabout unschooling academically �gifted� children, or if there is any<br/>\ndifference at all.  I want to start preparing now, and gathering<br/>\nresources, but I would like some input from others who are experienced<br/>\nwith this particular area. Any book recommendations?<br/>\n            I also wondered how I would be able to keep up with them in<br/>\nan unschooling setting.  For example, my 5 year old has already<br/>\nexhausted my knowledge of place values (I only know up to 100<br/>\ndectillion, and then googol and googol plex and I�m a math teacher by<br/>\ntrade lol) and counting in various languages.  My 9 year old is learning<br/>\nvisual c++ which I can�t help with.  Am I setting myself for failure?  I<br/>\nknow I�m smart, but how can I possibly help them learn everything they<br/>\nwant to learn?  Is it unschooling to let them have lessons that they ask<br/>\nfor in certain areas?  My 5 year old wanted to learn Spanish so bad, so<br/>\na friend of mine is helping him learn it (I don�t know it).<br/>\n <br/>\nQ<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.824 / Virus Database: 562 - Release Date: 12/28/2004<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102107,"nextTopicId":101990}}
