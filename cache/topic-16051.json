A good deal of actual LEARNING come from a need to know <br/>\nbasis.  If he has a real interest in physics, he will learn the math he <br/>\nneeds.  It is all interconnected, and once he sees that, he will either <br/>\nlearn the math or find something else that interests him.  I was interested <br/>\nin meteorology for a long time, but once I found out how much math was <br/>\nreally involved (talk about some ADVANCED calculus!), I decided that I <br/>\nreally did not want it that badly.
