(it&#39;s free!) You can <br/>\ndirect zillions of questions there!  We are hosting the Live & Learn <br/>\nUnschooling Conference in Columbia 11-13 October in downtown Columbia--two <br/>\nweeks away! You should REALLY consider coming! And you and your kids could <br/>\nmeet a bunch of other unschoolers IRL! <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can find info on both at     SchoolsOutSupport.org  <br/>\n<br/>\nLegally, you need to register with an accountabity association. SOS is <br/>\nplanning to form our own next year (we would have this year, but we needed 50 <br/>\nfamilies. Next year. Next year!), but right now, we are recommending <br/>\nPACESC---they&#39;re unschooling-friendly and are only asking for the <br/>\nminimum---the most important thing. The state requirements are minimal <br/>\n(&quot;teaching&quot; parent must have a high school diploma or equivalent; &quot;teach&quot; 180 <br/>\ndays/year; keep a portfolio/journal/record; and &quot;cover reading, writing, <br/>\n&#39;rithmatic, and social studies and literature and composition in highschool).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd having been to the DMV Tuesday: when your oldest goes for a driver&#39;s <br/>\nlicense, you&#39;ll NEED to be registered! <br/>\n<br/>\nI just spoke with the spokesman for DSS yesterday. Homeschooling is legal in <br/>\nSC, and as long as you&#39;re complying with the law (!!!), they cannot touch you <br/>\nfor &quot;educational neglect&quot;. If your neighbor is actually threatening you with <br/>\nreporting you, it would be in your best interest to BE registered and follow <br/>\nthe law---or buy that RV and/or move to New Mexico! &lt;G&gt; It&#39;s possible that if <br/>\nyou just get your records in compliance for THIS year, that you would be <br/>\ncovered (I don&#39;t know whether they &quot;dig&quot; into your past, but I&#39;d certainly <br/>\nget things in order for this year.).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your children know you trust them and that keeping the records is JUST to <br/>\ncomply with the law, why would it matter? (other than it&#39;s a pain.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease feel free to contact me off-list  with any more questions or call me @ <br/>\n803 776 4849.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10294444,"authorName":"Myranda","from":"&quot;Myranda&quot; &lt;myrandab@...&gt;","profile":"randascloudream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Question about SC from a lurker","postDate":"1033042744","msgId":44653,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYzkwMWMyNjU1NiRlODdlOWQ4MCQ2ZDE2NGVkOEBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwMzI5NzUxOTguNjU1LjU0OTEwLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwwMDIyMDFjMjY1MGQkNTAzNjQ3YjAkNmRmNjkwY2ZAUzAwMjY4NDA1MjY+"},"prevInTopic":44641,"nextInTopic":44662,"prevInTime":44652,"nextInTime":44654,"topicId":44641,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Margie, You can join PACESC (www.pacesc.com) for $25 to cover everyone.... they are very unschooler friendly, all you have to send in is the beginning of the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-112839160\">Margie,<br/>\nYou can join PACESC (www.pacesc.com) for $25 to cover everyone.... they are very unschooler friendly, all you have to send in is the beginning of the year simple application, and an end of the year signed statement saying you &quot;did&quot; school for the required 180 days and covered all subjects.
