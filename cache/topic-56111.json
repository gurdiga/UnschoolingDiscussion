A book itself cannot <br/>\n&gt; force an unwilling parent to spank their child; nor can any speaker <br/>\n&gt; force an unwilling parent to spank.  Parents who are feeling coerced <br/>\n&gt; and are opposed to spanking can walk away from a book, a speaker, a <br/>\n&gt; church.  They do not HAVE to spank; they are making a choice, a <br/>\n&gt; decision, to spank; and if they claim coercion, it is because they <br/>\n&gt; allowed themselves to be coerced.  They oughta grow a spine and <br/>\n&gt; say, &quot;No.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But they DON&#39;T. Often THEY were spanked, and although they didn&#39;t like it, <br/>\nthey turned out just fine, right? Everybody else is doing it---especially in <br/>\ntheir church/community. Preacher&#39;s saying it&#39;s the RIGHT thing to do. God <br/>\ncommands them to &quot;spare the rod and spoil the child&quot;. They don&#39;t know how to <br/>\nkeep little Bobby from talking back to his mama---and the book touted in the <br/>\nlast adult Sunday school class says to use a paddle or a switch. If he does <br/>\nit again, use it harder. Don&#39;t spank in anger---do it in cold blood, when <br/>\nyou&#39;re calm and calculating.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re being TOLD this, Deborah. A LOT. Sure, they are spineless and coerced <br/>\nand allowing someone else to make decisions for them. But they&#39;re also, every <br/>\nSunday and Wednesday, being told that they are SHEEP. That God is their <br/>\nshepherd and that the preacher is God&#39;s representative on earth and will LEAD <br/>\nthem the RIGHT way. They&#39;ve also all spent YEARS in school being told to <br/>\nlisten to and DO what others tell them to do. They are taught NOT to <br/>\nquestion. What do you REALLY expect? What do THEY really expect?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few who will break away and make their own decisions and choices. <br/>\nMost won&#39;t. They are Christians. And they will spank. God &quot;told&quot; them to.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce wrote something recently about  being able to swim. let me look...<br/>\nThis was originally written about H$LDA, but it applies here as well:<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce: <br/>\n&quot;For someone who can swim a piece of wood with rusty nails wouldn&#39;t look<br/>\nappealing as a floating aid. If they wanted to float, they&#39;d float on their<br/>\nbacks and grab a raft if it happened along. For someone who can&#39;t swim, the<br/>\npiece of wood with rusty nails would look like a lifesaver.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56109,"nextTopicId":56119}}
