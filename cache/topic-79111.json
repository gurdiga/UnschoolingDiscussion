I have found the more comfortable I&#39;ve become with our decision to unschool - the less concerned I am with what others think (actually I just don&#39;t care at all what others think -- I look at the kids and dh and see joy on all the faces....genuine happiness in being together.  That&#39;s all I need to know we are doing the right thing!).  I used to do a newsletter and will often still get calls and questions about the local group...I have no problem being myself and sharing my enthusiasm for our lifestyle and non-schooling choice.  Most folks who call get very quiet and don&#39;t call back.  It has been very empowering for me though.  We have been unschooling for two years...homeschooling overall for three.  After joining this list I let go of restrictions on tv, food and bedtimes.  This has been by far the best decision we have ever made!

Long story starting with being the only person in my/our circle of friends to have kids, eight years later we have the only four kids in our &#39;group&#39;.  Our friends love our kids and have included them in their wedding parties (5-6 of them) but they are not always doing things that the kids can participate in.  Dance clubs, keg parties and the like.  We have many families with which we try to do things with occasionally but my problem is that our philosophies are so different.  It always turns out that the Mom will threaten and/or spank when we are out at some point.  I don&#39;t want to hang out with people that don&#39;t increase my enjoyment of life.  Watching their littleones deal with mommy smacking them is too depressing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what it is, with me so continually finding people like this.  My personality I would guess. :-D  I like dancing, hard music, and have sex on the brain a lot(4kids)8-0 that tends to make it hard for me to become good friends with the women that are kind considerate parents.
