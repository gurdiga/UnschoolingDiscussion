(admittedly it can be abused too, but i<br/>\ndon&#39;t use it for &quot;entertainment&quot;) i think television is very different<br/>\nfrom the internet.<br/>\n<br/>\ni think human beings as a race have a reckless disregard for the<br/>\nnatural balance of our ecosystem, and a brash consumerism and<br/>\ncommercial culture that promotes buying instead of feeling.  we are<br/>\nrunning away from something.  (not saying you all are like this--<br/>\nactually i love the way you talk about the rhythm of your days, the<br/>\nfreedom)   ...everytime<br/>\ni turn on the tv i see this promoted.  i see disattachment,<br/>\npunishment, abuse, and gratuitous violence.  the images that<br/>\ntelevision passively recorded for me, because my parents let me watch<br/>\nwhatever i want, disturb me to this day: things like people getting<br/>\nshot, car chases, and buildings exploding.  i think film is a very<br/>\npowerful art form, and i have loved and been deeply moved by some<br/>\nfilms.  i appreciate less than 5% of what i see on tv, though, and<br/>\nthat is not enough to make it worthwhile to have in my home.  i also<br/>\ndon&#39;t feel it is necessary to introduce video and film as a medium to<br/>\na young child, when they are in a learning phase which is primarily<br/>\nmulti-sensorial in nature.  i will have no problems having tv in the house<br/>\nif my daughter insists on it when she is older.<br/>\n<br/>\nin case you are wondering, no, i don&#39;t have a perfect life and the way<br/>\nwe live looks a lot like the way everyone else lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nbut i have tried to raise my daughter in a very different way than i was<br/>\nraised-- i breastfed her and took her with me everywhere, whereas i<br/>\nwas sat in front of the tv from an early age, my real needs ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\nso the way i see it, there seem to be simple things i can do to make a<br/>\ndifference and live closer to the life i want to live.  things like<br/>\ngrowing my own food or buying local food.  things like not bothering<br/>\nwith tv are easy.  no, i don&#39;t own a microwave, i don&#39;t eat any white sugar,<br/>\nand i stop people from giving my daughter sugar.  we go to bed at<br/>\nsunset (usually) so we get enough sleep.  i don&#39;t buy cosmetics, cleaning products, etc.  i<br/>\ndon&#39;t care very much about trying to keep up with the latest toy, tool<br/>\nor technology.  i try to focus instead on spending as much time as we<br/>\ncan together-- the only kind of passive activity i need<br/>\non a regular basis is being in nature.<br/>\n<br/>\njana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128968868,"authorName":"jidafral@cs.com","from":"jidafral@...","profile":"hsmomofthree","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] re:  plug-in drug","postDate":"1048680887","msgId":62084,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIzLjJkOTQxOGM0LjJiYjJmM2I3QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":62083,"nextInTopic":62087,"prevInTime":62083,"nextInTime":62085,"topicId":61933,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/26/2003 6:41:32 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...

If your husband started spending long hours at<br/>\nwork, then there&#39;s probably something that he needs that he&#39;s finding at<br/>\nwork and not at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your children are watching TV (reading books, riding skateboards) rather<br/>\nthan doing other things, then it means they&#39;re getting something from TV<br/>\n(reading books, riding skateboards) that they aren&#39;t getting elsewhere. It&#39;s<br/>\nour job to make sure their lives are rich enough that they do have other<br/>\noptions so they aren&#39;t watching TV because there isn&#39;t anything better.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids will play with rocks and dirt if they don&#39;t have anything else to play<br/>\nwith. And adults will think this is a sign that their imaginations are being<br/>\nstretched. So should we deprive children of toys so parents can see them<br/>\nusing their imaginations? Or should we as parents find out what it is that<br/>\nkids see and need and want in the things they are drawn to and help them<br/>\nfind more of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can&#39;t see what children are getting from TV. It looks like nothing is<br/>\ngoing on. But their brains are working. They&#39;re absorbing the stories and<br/>\nthe character interactions. It&#39;s even more powerful when they have someone<br/>\nto share it with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m talking about some of the seemingly mindless cartoon dribble that<br/>\n&gt; has no obvious value.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What if your husband looked at something you found value in and judged it<br/>\nthat way?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we don&#39;t see value in what a spouse loves doing, we trust that they do<br/>\nfind value in it. And if we want to be closer to them, we spend time with<br/>\nthem, ask questions and try to see what it is that they see. Not necessarily<br/>\nso we will like it too, but so we can understand why they like it and find<br/>\nout more about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy should we treat our children in ways that we would feel is disrespectful<br/>\nand hurtful coming from our spouse?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are huge numbers of things that children do that seem in adult eyes to<br/>\nbe mindless drivel or to at least have no &quot;educational&quot; value. Swinging on<br/>\nswings, playing in the dirt, banging on pots, pretending to fly. And, in<br/>\nfact, when you think about it, much of even good children¹s literature. What<br/>\ndo children learn from Winnie-the-Pooh, Peter Pan, Wizard of Oz?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has been drawing since she could pick up a marker. At about age<br/>\n7 she seemed to regress. She spent a whole year doing books of &quot;snowflakes&quot;<br/>\nand scribbles. Really crude snowflakes, like big full page asterisks in<br/>\nvarious colors. Books 5 to 10 pages long of stuff 2 yos could do. Why? I<br/>\nhave no clue. She did very little other drawing. Then one day she saw a<br/>\nstapler on the floor and drew this really amazing rendering of it. Far<br/>\nbetter than anything she had done before her snowflake period. I have no<br/>\nidea what was going on with the snowflakes but it was something she needed<br/>\nand it was powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren are designed to learn. They are drawn to what helps them understand<br/>\nand explore the world. We need to trust that they know what they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not up to us to decide what is best for them, or what is more<br/>\nlearningful. If that approach worked, then schools would work like a charm.<br/>\nIt is up to us to bring the world to them so they can choose what they need<br/>\nfrom a variety of things. If what they choose is TV then that&#39;s what they<br/>\nneed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When I said I cant get their attention, I meant even to ask them<br/>\n&gt; where something is or if they wanted breakfast, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I&#39;m reading or writing there have been many times that my family has had<br/>\nto ask me something a few times before I actually hear them. In fact I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen known to respond and then return to what I was doing to finish up and<br/>\nthen get engrossed again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I do think television is addictive-- our physiology has no way of<br/>\n&gt; dealing with it, because it is so different<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For a theory to hold water it has to explain all the data, not just the data<br/>\nthat support it. Our children&#39;s behavior around TV indicates your theory has<br/>\nholes in it. Our children can watch as much as they want and they pick and<br/>\nchoose and turn it off when they&#39;re done. Sometimes they&#39;ll watch for days.<br/>\nSometimes they won&#39;t even turn it on. They treat it as they do any other<br/>\nresource like books and toys and outside activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey aren&#39;t allowed freedom *because* they turn it off. They turn it off<br/>\nbecause they have freedom. The children who do use tv as a resource who were<br/>\nrestricted before usually spent a lot of time engrossed in the TV when the<br/>\nrestrictions were lifted. Eventually, when they realized that it wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nrestricted again and they&#39;d had their fill, they felt confident that they<br/>\ncould turn it off and they could turn it back on anytime they needed to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think TV does work for many families, but for my own reasons I<br/>\n&gt; decided to get rid of it...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What about your children&#39;s reasons? What if you found value in something,<br/>\nlike a sewing machine or microwave, and your husband decided to get rid of<br/>\nit for his own reasons? What if those reasons were perfectly reasonable to<br/>\nhim, but made no sense to you?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; having it completely gone was a lot<br/>\n&gt; easier for me than trying to sift through the programming in order to<br/>\n&gt; find shows that were worth watching.  There weren&#39;t very many.  I am<br/>\n&gt; also highly selective with books I pick out to read...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The library is full of books I have no iterest in reading. It may take more<br/>\ntime finding good picture books than reading them. It would have made my<br/>\nlife a lot easier if I just didn&#39;t go to the library. I wouldn&#39;t have had to<br/>\nspend time looking or reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just find<br/>\n&gt; that there is so much over-stimulation these days that I want my home<br/>\n&gt; to be a refuge from the media.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And what do your children want? If Steven Spielberg&#39;s mom had felt that way,<br/>\nwe wouldn&#39;t have Star Wars. That doesn&#39;t mean that every child who watches<br/>\nTV will be the next Steven Spielberg but it means we can&#39;t know where our<br/>\nchildren&#39;s interests will take them. TV is a powerful story telling medium.<br/>\nIt does what all literature has done from the beginning of story telling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am not sure why people say that they can have unrestricted TV in<br/>\n&gt; their house *and* also find the time to do all the other things they<br/>\n&gt; want to do with their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I say it because it&#39;s true. And I&#39;m not judging how our time is spent based<br/>\non what *I* want to do with my daughter, but on what my daughter wants to do<br/>\n(with or without me). If she has a huge number of options and chooses a<br/>\nprogram on TV, then that program is what she needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It directly interfered with or replaced story-telling, music,<br/>\n&gt; walks outdoors, and the like in our family, all things that I love and<br/>\n&gt; my daughter loves.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Everything will replace something else. We&#39;re always choosing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter and I read in bed every morning. She could go down and turn on<br/>\nthe TV when she wakes up but she prefers to read with me. Is our book<br/>\nreading interfering with her TV watching? Or is she choosing the one she<br/>\nprefers at the time?<br/>\n<br/>\nWas your daughter complaining that she didn&#39;t have time for walks? Getting<br/>\nrid of the TV didn&#39;t help her figure out how to solve that problem. It just<br/>\neliminated the problem. She could have recorded programs to watch when she<br/>\ncame back or when it was rainy or dark. You could have helped her get a<br/>\nsense of time management by talking about how long things take and how many<br/>\nhours there were to do them in. There are plenty of solutions if we start<br/>\nthinking outside of the box.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The other thing I hated about television was that<br/>\n&gt; when we did have it, it was too easy for me to use it as a babysitter.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And if your husband had a problem telling the kids to go read a book instead<br/>\nof being with them, is the problem the books or your husband&#39;s attitude and<br/>\nrelationship with the kids? What is it that needs fixed?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] re: plug-in drug","postDate":"1048679482","msgId":62083,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4Ni4xNzU1Nzk1Yy4yYmIyZWUzYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62082,"nextInTopic":62084,"prevInTime":62082,"nextInTime":62084,"topicId":61933,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/25/03 10:09:57 PM, stephanie.elms@deltasolutions.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-611504262\">In a message dated 3/25/03 10:09:57 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stephanie.elms@...\">stephanie.elms@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I could write quite<br/>\n<br/>\na bit of what he has learned from playing mindless bionicle computer games <br/>\nand read<br/>\n<br/>\nmindless bionicle comics.... &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are mindless bionicle comics, Marty doesn&#39;t have the whole set!

Just because you see it as mindless dribble doesn&#39;t mean it is to them. Sometimes literally weeks or months go by before one of my children will come up with something that they saw on tv. Possibly something I might have looked at as insignificant but definitely something that caught their interest and they stored away for later. I can&#39;t see how you think what your children are watching has no value. If that&#39;s the case, then you don&#39;t trust them to make wise choices and it sounds as if you think they possibly can&#39;t because of what interests them on tv. That&#39;s not a good start to unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;When I said I cant get their attention, I meant even to ask them <br/>\n  where something is or if they wanted breakfast, etc.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our kitchen is right next to the playroom. We have a large pass through window. I&#39;m literally standing right there all day as I seem to always be in the kitchen. So for breakfast and lunch and dinner and snacks, I&#39;m standing right there asking what they want. I sometimes have to ask 3-4 times, raising my voice slightly each time. Sometimes after that, I kind of holler quickly the name of the person I need an answer from. They are just really into what they are watching. Or sometimes just what they are doing. I don&#39;t see it as a big deal. My husband does the same thing to me now while he&#39;s watching the war stuff on tv. Totally engrossed and not in tune with anything else. Again, so what? If I have something important to say, I walk around and stand briefly in front of the tv, asking if they can listen to me for a minute. They&#39;ll either say yes or ask me to wait. Catching their eye helps me to see that they hear what I need them to hear.

My eldest son Joseph just turned 11 yesterday and this morning we went out and he picked up Pokemon Ruby with some of his birthday money.

He has already told us that he will be busy for a few days once he gets it. ;)  But it&#39;s true that a lot of other life goes on, not the least of which is a lot of research!  While he&#39;s playing Ruby he&#39;s also listening to me read the last 6 chapters of Harry Potter #4 ... it&#39;s our third time through it. In fact, we know once we start &quot;The Third Task&quot; chapter that we can&#39;t stop until the end so we&#39;ve waited a couple of days through the birthday gatherings before settling in to read the end.  The first time we read the book we were up until 3am finishing it!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m on a quick break right now while my daughter Alyssa (8), helps my youngest son Michael (5) with a puzzle in his Scooby Doo computer game, which he&#39;s playing while I read.
