On top of that there might naturally be a feeling of <br/>\nsibling rivalry and jealousy in the hearts of the kids that weren&#39;t sick <br/>\nand didn&#39;t get the extra time and worry that one child did get.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really hard that you can&#39;t have people over to babysit or help <br/>\nbecause of the immune issues.  Maybe people can at least leave <br/>\ncasseroles on your porch or loan you some new DVDs and books on tape?  <br/>\n(When I&#39;m exhausted, I think the easiest way to love a kid is <br/>\nhalf-asleep cuddling on the couch while they watch something on TV.)  <br/>\nMaybe they can take one or two of the kids on outings?  Or chat with <br/>\nyour kids on the phone or at least be penpals?  Secret Santas?<br/>\n<br/>\nGive as much love and attention as you can, possibly looking for the <br/>\neasiest ways you can think of to make your kids feel great. (Hugs in <br/>\npassing?  Tiny favors?  Serving special foods?  Reading very favorite <br/>\nbooks?)  Your life will be easier and their behavior better once they <br/>\nfeel more secure.  You are undoubtedly frazzled, but summon up as much <br/>\ngooey love and serenity as you possibly can in each moment.  Smell the <br/>\nkids heads and remember everything you love most about them.  Get out <br/>\nphoto albums and talk to them affectionately about things they did when <br/>\nthey were little.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of my favorite stress-management techniques are deep breathing, <br/>\nlaughing and singing.  While listening to music cheers me up, singing <br/>\nalong feels like an even better stress release.  So play some Christmas <br/>\ncarols, or other music that you like, and sing and frolic a little with <br/>\nyour kids.  It&#39;s the cheapest therapy I can think of.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  I encourage my son to go to bed at around 10 because his dad gets up <br/>\nat 5:30 and it&#39;s easier to get enough sleep.  Often he&#39;ll just read <br/>\nuntil he falls asleep.  If he feels to energetic to do that, then he <br/>\nstays up watching TV until 11 or so, but that isn&#39;t great for me, as our <br/>\nhouse is fairly open and he laughs really loud at The Simpsons.  My <br/>\npersonal rule isn&#39;t &quot;no bedtimes&quot; it&#39;s &quot;no bullying the kid into going <br/>\nto bed&quot;.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143188961,"authorName":"Ann","from":"Ann &lt;ann_mv05@...&gt;","profile":"ann_mv05","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Bedtimes...","postDate":"1133188527","msgId":110267,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMTI4MTQzNTI3LjcyOTM3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzNDA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE1OC41ZDdlOTYxNC4zMGJiYzk5ZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":110261,"nextInTopic":110268,"prevInTime":110266,"nextInTime":110268,"topicId":91570,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There are reasons for quiet.

We have &#39;bedroom time&#39;.  This is is so that Dad can get the rest he needs to be at work by 8am.  Thus Sunday-Thursday everyone goes to their own rooms at that time, they may do anything they want in their room as long as no one else hears them.  If it ever even once disturbs some one else, then that activity is off the list of choices for that time.  My teen often listens to music with headphones on and falls asleep that way.  My 12 year old often reads or draws for about an hour but then goes to sleep.  My 11 yr old son is a &#39;lark&#39;, he usually puts himself to bed around 9. <br/>\n   <br/>\n   If I had a little one, I would let them have a bottle anytime they wanted.  Recovering from traumatic family circumstances means that whatever aids comfort and healing needs to be the priortiy.  Do your little ones co-sleep?  When mine were little, just being in bed with me, having their bottle or nursing with lights out and quiet setled them down very quickly.  Oh and it really helped to give them a nice warm bath before bed it was a soothing transition thing.  Even now, my kids like a hot shower before bed.  I hope something works for you and you get some sleep soon.  It sounds like you have really been through hell.<br/>\n  Ann<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

Jacob <br/>\nwas his father&#39;s favorite scapegoat.

Ross(their father) is in <br/>\ntherapy, has been in therapy and there is little improvment to be <br/>\nexpected given his &quot;diagnosis.&quot;  Given the fact that he still <br/>\nCOMPLETELY denies that there is any problem after more than two <br/>\nyears of therapy, and a few different psych evals, improvement will <br/>\nbe a loonnggg time coming.

I will try to be <br/>\nbrief...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 6 children ages 19 months, 4,8,11, 13(in Jan) and 14 years.  I <br/>\nleft their father in March 2004 and am now divorced.  (He has many <br/>\nissues and has subsequently been labelled &quot;Narcissistic Personality <br/>\nDisorder.&quot;  His visitation w/the kids has been suspended since May <br/>\n2005 by CPS because of some bizarre behavior on his part--loonng <br/>\nstory.)  My oldest three spent some time in ps (2,3, qnd 4 years <br/>\nrespectively)  Jossilyn (now 8) had not gone to ps at all until last <br/>\nfall.  She begged to go and I allowed others to convince me it would <br/>\nbe &quot;easier&quot; to send the kids back to ps--boy were they ever wrong!!  A <br/>\nfew weeks into the year they were all back at home.  We have always <br/>\nbeen more unschoolers towards &quot;school stuff&quot; but their father is a <br/>\nmajor control freak so had strict rules for just about everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In May Jossilyn was diagnosed with AML (acute myeloid leukemia.)  <br/>\nShe and I spent most of the summer in the hospital 90 miles from home <br/>\nand in August we went to Boston (210 miles away) for a bone marrow <br/>\ntransplant.  We came home in Oct.  (Her father was allowed visits in <br/>\nhospital w/Jossilyn--the others still haven&#39;t seen him since May.)<br/>\nThe kids stayed with my parents--not great but...--and with good <br/>\nfriends--better but limited time possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that we are home, everyone wants to be with Mom.  Which brings me <br/>\nto the bedtime question.  Pre-cancer, the little ones went to bed <br/>\nearlier--between 8-9pm.  The baby was nursing and Kaylin would go to <br/>\nbed with us and fall asleep.  The others would wander off to bed at <br/>\nvarious times, usually leaving Jacob and I and sometimes Kelsey to <br/>\nstay up later.  Jacob(almost 13) has ALWAYS been a nightowl and would <br/>\noften read in bed until 2am even when he was 8.  Those late nights <br/>\nkind of became &quot;our&quot; time to chat or whatever.  Kelsey (14)joining us <br/>\nwas never a problem because he has always been close to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the summer things changed, of course.  Kaylin had no bedtime, and <br/>\nwould just fall asleep where-ever and when-ever.  My mother &quot;made&quot; the <br/>\nolder kids go to bed by 11, which they did not fuss about.  In the <br/>\nhospital, Jossilyn developed a new schedule, often staying up until <br/>\n2am watching TV.  She had always been a very active, healthy child and <br/>\nthe inactivity and confinement were tough.  Still, not a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that we are home NO ONE WANTS TO GO TO BED!  Even if they are so <br/>\ntired they just can&#39;t stand themselves.  Still, I understand that they <br/>\nmissed me and the little ones have separation anxiety, etc.  I could <br/>\ndeal with it.  But the older ones really miss &quot;our&quot; time together <br/>\nwithout the littles.  I&#39;ve tried putting them to bed, but the instant <br/>\nI get back up, Kaylin wakes up screaming.  Or she bugs Josie so she <br/>\nwon&#39;t go to sleep.  To top it all off, when the others do go to bed <br/>\nJacob has taken to harassing the others until the entire house is in <br/>\nan uproar and we are lucky to settle down by 3am.  Josie is usually up <br/>\nby 7am, like clockwork so I get up with her.  Naps are scarce.  I&#39;m <br/>\nexhausted.  What to do?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to keep this brief, and I don&#39;t even know if I was very <br/>\nclear.  I forgot to mention that my mother was putting Josie to bed <br/>\nwith a bottle of milk, or attempts at breaking the habit is also <br/>\nadding to bedtime difficulties.

Dentist 1 had said that Lydia had 2 cavities, we got one filled by him and then switched dentists because I was so unhappy with his behavior during the filling.  The Dentist 2 said that Dentist 1 had taken the xrays wrong and that Lydia did *not* have a second cavity.   Made me wonder about being paid by the procedure also. <br/>\n<br/>\nLydia didn&#39;t brush with toothpaste until she was over 6, and now uses a toothpaste that is &quot;low foaming&quot; which she likes. The toothpaste cap also plays music for the lenght of time you are supposed to brush - which is corny but she really likes it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe never forced brushing (although we did a lot of playing, like counting teeth and singing songs, etc., when she was younger).  About 3 days a week, brushing just didn&#39;t happen.  She has had only the one cavity (which I am now suspicious of whether she had it or not).  I agree with the people who think cavities are largely controlled by genes. <br/>\n<br/>\nOddly enough, Jonathan (16 months) LOVES to brush his teeth.  He brushes his teeth (pretty well, too, I might add - of course, he only has 10) every time we go into the bathroom.  I guess it is just somehting that he sees adults and his older sister doing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the rest of the original issue, also - the kids and I all wear loose cotton clothes all day and usually sleep in them.

First off, our household is way more<br/>\n&gt; relaxed ever since I let go of controlling my kid&#39;s eating, TV  <br/>\n&gt; watching,<br/>\n&gt; bedtimes (my kids are ages 3 and 4).  I am happier, my husband is  <br/>\n&gt; happier,<br/>\n&gt; and my kids are happier.  However, there is still one event that takes  <br/>\n&gt; place<br/>\n&gt; every evening that seems to still send everybody into a tizzy.  The  <br/>\n&gt; simple<br/>\n&gt; act of brushing my children&#39;s teeth and getting them into something<br/>\n&gt; comfortable to wear to bed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It usually goes something like this....I get tired and inform my  <br/>\n&gt; children<br/>\n&gt; that I am going to go lie down soon and that I want to brush their  <br/>\n&gt; teeth and<br/>\n&gt; get them ready for bed.  This is met with, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go to  <br/>\n&gt; bed!&quot;  I<br/>\n&gt; explain that they don&#39;t have to go to bed, but that they need their  <br/>\n&gt; teeth<br/>\n&gt; brushed and to get into pajamas, and then they can play the rest of the<br/>\n&gt; night if they want to.  So then I usually tell them that we will brush  <br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; teeth in the next five minutes.  Five minutes later I attempt again  <br/>\n&gt; and it<br/>\n&gt; is met with a lot of struggle.  Then I usually have to just be firm  <br/>\n&gt; and make<br/>\n&gt; them do it which is not fun.  I am tired at this time of day and do  <br/>\n&gt; not have<br/>\n&gt; tons of patience. After that they are fine but irritated with being<br/>\n&gt; interrupted in their play.  As far as their pajamas go, they usually  <br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; sleep in that day&#39;s T-shirt, which is fine.  After the teeth brushing,  <br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; are fine staying up and playing and then just go to sleep when they are<br/>\n&gt; tired.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have explained the importance of brushing teeth and why we do it.   <br/>\n&gt; We have<br/>\n&gt; gone out and picked out fun brushes and special cups for rinsing.  I  <br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; asked why they don&#39;t like it and I get mixed responses from &quot;it hurts&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; to &quot;I<br/>\n&gt; just don&#39;t want to.&quot;  I make sure I am very gentle and my son knows to  <br/>\n&gt; raise<br/>\n&gt; his hand in the air if he wants me to stop brushing.  I try to think of<br/>\n&gt; something fun we can do afterwards like read a book in bed.  Nothing  <br/>\n&gt; works.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I am assuming that I am just not getting something here.  Should I  <br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; not even suggest that they change into clothes for sleeping in?  That  <br/>\n&gt; I can<br/>\n&gt; see would make sense.  Maybe I should get them pajamas that they can  <br/>\n&gt; change<br/>\n&gt; into by themselves so they have that choice.  But with the teeth thing  <br/>\n&gt; I am<br/>\n&gt; at a loss.  I feel like it is my parental duty to make sure they have  <br/>\n&gt; clean<br/>\n&gt; teeth before they go to sleep, and that they are too young to  <br/>\n&gt; understand the<br/>\n&gt; importance of this.  What if I just gave up and later in life they had  <br/>\n&gt; bad<br/>\n&gt; teeth - I don&#39;t think they would appreciate that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anybody else deal with this before?  Any advice would be greatly<br/>\n&gt; appreciated.  I think our whole family really dreads the teeth brushing<br/>\n&gt; every night and I would love to get past it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you,<br/>\n&gt; Erika  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Create a Job Alert on MSN Careers and enter for a chance to win $1000!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://msn.careerbuilder.com/promo/kaday.htm?\">http://msn.careerbuilder.com/promo/kaday.htm?</a> <br/>\n&gt; siteid=CBMSN_1K&sc_extcmp=JS_JASweep_MSNHotm2<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

She is 4 and at the moment is refusing to<br/>\nbrush with ï¿½no thanksï¿½ when I invite her to do so ï¿½ usually while I am<br/>\nbrushing. We go through stages of lots of brushing, and I have to say that<br/>\nshe often asks for new little brushes and new toothpastes at the market when<br/>\nshe sees them, but then uses the paste for painting the sink pink! She hates<br/>\nall flavors that we have tried, including the new ï¿½orangeï¿½ one (urk!). When<br/>\nshe brushes she uses water. I think she has one cavity in one tooth, but I<br/>\nwould rather let her have that and go to the dentist when she is more<br/>\nmature, than force her, drag her to the dentist, make her afraid and angry<br/>\nand generally lose any chance of her being willing to engage in good oral<br/>\ncare as she ages. After all she will lose these teeth, and they are not very<br/>\nold since she didnï¿½t get any teeth at all until she was one. I want her to<br/>\ngrow up seeing her health as in her own hands with the medical professionals<br/>\nbeing her helpers and advisors, rather than magisterial authorities. I have<br/>\nshown her pictures from the internet of bad teeth as an encouragement ï¿½ it<br/>\nmay have backfired as she certainly sees nothing like it in her mouth. She<br/>\nalso drinks lots of water, especially at night, so hopefully that helps to<br/>\nrinse them a bit. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for pyjamas ï¿½ Jayn sometimes changes into her princess pjï¿½s because she<br/>\nloves them, sometimes sleeps in her clothes if they are soft and comfy, and<br/>\nsometimes just wears her panties. This changing into special sleepwear is a<br/>\ncarry over from the traditional parenting (which I call ï¿½ordinary<br/>\nparentingï¿½) idea that you MUST have a ROUTINE in order to get the children<br/>\nto bed at BEDTIME ï¿½ kind of Pavlovï¿½s kids. The purpose of routine is to<br/>\nremove questioning and free thought or alternative desires as much as<br/>\npossible. Stop caring what they wear to sleep. Seriously. Let them see that<br/>\nyou are taking care of your own needs and going to bed when you need to, but<br/>\nlet them be. If they really want to wear pjï¿½s themselves, let them be slip<br/>\nover types and maybe the elders could help the younger if really needed. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

First off, our household is way more<br/>\n&gt; relaxed ever since I let go of controlling my kid&#39;s eating, TV watching,<br/>\n&gt; bedtimes (my kids are ages 3 and 4).  I am happier, my husband is happier,<br/>\n&gt; and my kids are happier.  However, there is still one event that takes<br/>\nplace<br/>\n&gt; every evening that seems to still send everybody into a tizzy.  The simple<br/>\n&gt; act of brushing my children&#39;s teeth and getting them into something<br/>\n&gt; comfortable to wear to bed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It usually goes something like this....I get tired and inform my children<br/>\n&gt; that I am going to go lie down soon and that I want to brush their teeth<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; get them ready for bed.  This is met with, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go to bed!&quot;  I<br/>\n&gt; explain that they don&#39;t have to go to bed, but that they need their teeth<br/>\n&gt; brushed and to get into pajamas, and then they can play the rest of the<br/>\n&gt; night if they want to.  So then I usually tell them that we will brush<br/>\ntheir<br/>\n&gt; teeth in the next five minutes.  Five minutes later I attempt again and it<br/>\n&gt; is met with a lot of struggle.  Then I usually have to just be firm and<br/>\nmake<br/>\n&gt; them do it which is not fun.  I am tired at this time of day and do not<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; tons of patience. After that they are fine but irritated with being<br/>\n&gt; interrupted in their play.  As far as their pajamas go, they usually just<br/>\n&gt; sleep in that day&#39;s T-shirt, which is fine.  After the teeth brushing,<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; are fine staying up and playing and then just go to sleep when they are<br/>\n&gt; tired.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have explained the importance of brushing teeth and why we do it.  We<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; gone out and picked out fun brushes and special cups for rinsing.  I have<br/>\n&gt; asked why they don&#39;t like it and I get mixed responses from &quot;it hurts&quot; to<br/>\n&quot;I<br/>\n&gt; just don&#39;t want to.&quot;  I make sure I am very gentle and my son knows to<br/>\nraise<br/>\n&gt; his hand in the air if he wants me to stop brushing.

First off, our household is way more <br/>\nrelaxed ever since I let go of controlling my kid&#39;s eating, TV watching, <br/>\nbedtimes (my kids are ages 3 and 4).  I am happier, my husband is happier, <br/>\nand my kids are happier.  However, there is still one event that takes place <br/>\nevery evening that seems to still send everybody into a tizzy.  The simple <br/>\nact of brushing my children&#39;s teeth and getting them into something <br/>\ncomfortable to wear to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt usually goes something like this....I get tired and inform my children <br/>\nthat I am going to go lie down soon and that I want to brush their teeth and <br/>\nget them ready for bed.  This is met with, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go to bed!&quot;  I <br/>\nexplain that they don&#39;t have to go to bed, but that they need their teeth <br/>\nbrushed and to get into pajamas, and then they can play the rest of the <br/>\nnight if they want to.  So then I usually tell them that we will brush their <br/>\nteeth in the next five minutes.  Five minutes later I attempt again and it <br/>\nis met with a lot of struggle.  Then I usually have to just be firm and make <br/>\nthem do it which is not fun.  I am tired at this time of day and do not have <br/>\ntons of patience. After that they are fine but irritated with being <br/>\ninterrupted in their play.  As far as their pajamas go, they usually just <br/>\nsleep in that day&#39;s T-shirt, which is fine.  After the teeth brushing, they <br/>\nare fine staying up and playing and then just go to sleep when they are <br/>\ntired.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have explained the importance of brushing teeth and why we do it.  We have <br/>\ngone out and picked out fun brushes and special cups for rinsing.  I have <br/>\nasked why they don&#39;t like it and I get mixed responses from &quot;it hurts&quot; to &quot;I <br/>\njust don&#39;t want to.&quot;  I make sure I am very gentle and my son knows to raise <br/>\nhis hand in the air if he wants me to stop brushing.  I try to think of <br/>\nsomething fun we can do afterwards like read a book in bed.  Nothing works.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am assuming that I am just not getting something here.  Should I just <br/>\nnot even suggest that they change into clothes for sleeping in?  That I can <br/>\nsee would make sense.  Maybe I should get them pajamas that they can change <br/>\ninto by themselves so they have that choice.  But with the teeth thing I am <br/>\nat a loss.  I feel like it is my parental duty to make sure they have clean <br/>\nteeth before they go to sleep, and that they are too young to understand the <br/>\nimportance of this.  What if I just gave up and later in life they had bad <br/>\nteeth - I don&#39;t think they would appreciate that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody else deal with this before?  Any advice would be greatly <br/>\nappreciated.  I think our whole family really dreads the teeth brushing <br/>\nevery night and I would love to get past it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nErika  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCreate a Job Alert on MSN Careers and enter for a chance to win $1000! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://msn.careerbuilder.com/promo/kaday.htm?siteid=CBMSN_1K&sc_extcmp=JS_JASweep_MSNHotm2\">http://msn.careerbuilder.com/promo/kaday.htm?siteid=CBMSN_1K&sc_extcmp=JS_JASweep_MSNHotm2</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110358,"nextTopicId":110395}}
