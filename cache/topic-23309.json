My name is Michele, I&#39;m from North Jersey,<br/>\nam fairly new to this list too, and am homeschooling a<br/>\n13 year old daughter and we started last year too and<br/>\nalso started with the whole curriculum route. (Most of<br/>\nmy family would probably describe my daughter as<br/>\nunmotivated as well.)  Since I&#39;m as new as you I only<br/>\nhave 2 possible suggestions: 1) I really liked the<br/>\nTeenage Liberation Handbook. Don&#39;t know if my daughter<br/>\nread it, but it sure helped me to relax!! (And sort of<br/>\naddresses some of your concerns re: &#39;subjects&#39;.) 2) I<br/>\nalso read Clonlara&#39;s info about what they consider<br/>\nmath, science, etc. in everyday life.  It&#39;s taking me<br/>\na while to see &#39;subjects&#39; in everyday life, and<br/>\nreading their info helped.  <br/>\nMichele<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!

(suddenly i was having the old homework wars <br/>\ncoming back) having &quot;well meaning&quot; relatives putting in their two <br/>\ncents wasnt helping either. they kept saying how my daughter was too <br/>\nlazy and unreliable to homeschool. (huh?) by the beginning of summer <br/>\ni was ready to throw in the towel and send her back to public school. <br/>\nbut then i sat and thought of the positive things she had accomplish <br/>\nthis year. we kept a list of all the books she read this year and <br/>\nthere was over 60 (and a few were actually &quot;classics&quot; LOL ) she self <br/>\ntaught herself webdesign and html, drawing, and cooking.  once i <br/>\nstarted to focus more on the positive and less on the negative i <br/>\nrealized we did accomplish alot this year. and the biggest thing that <br/>\nall the relatives seem not to focus on (cuz we know academics is so <br/>\nmuch more &quot;important&quot; LOL ) is when i took my daughter out of school <br/>\nshe was so depressed and unhappy. now she&#39;s like a differnt person <br/>\nshe volunteers at a teen hotline center and makes reassurance calls <br/>\nto elderly shutins. she has so many friends now and is so cheerful. <br/>\nso i know this was a good decision and we will continue with it. <br/>\nthough i will admit i am a little nervouse about unschooling high <br/>\nschool. is anyone doing that now? and how do you manage things like <br/>\nscience, math, and history? sorry this was so long i just got so <br/>\nexcited when i found this list. thanks and any info would be great <br/>\nmost of the people i know who h/s use books and curriculm .  thanks <br/>\nagain  cindy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23241,"nextTopicId":23300}}
