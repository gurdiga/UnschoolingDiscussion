Today, in our wussy,<br/>\ntolerant, child-worship society (I&#39;m guilty, too) we have a hard time with<br/>\nsuch limitations. We have credit cards (debt) that stretches our finances<br/>\nout in time, and therefore keeps things, such as kids&#39; allowances,<br/>\n&quot;flexible&quot; instead of limited. In other words, they learn that our words<br/>\ndon&#39;t mean what they say.  ( Hmmmm -- some will say that I&#39;m calling us all<br/>\nliars in our dealings with our kids. SWSWSW  )<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that might help is telling your kid exactly how much money  you<br/>\nearn and how it all gets spent, or saved, or given away to the needy...<br/>\n<br/>\nMake a simple balance sheet and show it to them  -- the facts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s unschooling, that&#39;s letting your kids get involved in reality.<br/>\nThat&#39;s an example of trusting, and respecting the kids as equal members of<br/>\nthe family.   They can handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you don&#39;t do that, you can be true to your idea of allowance by<br/>\nsaying -- about that &quot;other thing&quot; that the kid wants after she spends this<br/>\nweek&#39;s allowance on a furry animal -- &quot;OOOOO, I like it too, but the money<br/>\nis already spent, so let&#39;s keep this thing in mind for how to spend NEXT<br/>\nWEEK&#39;S allowance.&quot;      No explanation needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a huge benefit in anticipating the joy of having something.<br/>\nOften it&#39;s better than having it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\n&quot;The first half of life is ruined by our parents and the second half by our<br/>\nchildren.&quot;   -- Clarence Darrow</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40772,"nextTopicId":40756}}
