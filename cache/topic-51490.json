There&#39;s a huge important difference between approaching<br/>\nkids with the attitude that you will do what you can to help them meet their<br/>\nneeds and approaching them with the attitude you&#39;ll get them what they ask<br/>\nfor. They keep getting equated and they aren&#39;t the same at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIT&#39;s the difference again between being opened and closed. When we go to our<br/>\nhusbands for help on something they know a lot about, we&#39;d want them to<br/>\nproject an attitude of &quot;What can I do to help?&quot; rather than an attitude of<br/>\n&quot;I might or might not help you depending on how much trouble it is.&quot; He<br/>\nmight not be able to help. Being ignorant of what we&#39;re asking, we might<br/>\nunknowingly be asking too much. But rather than him saying no, it would be a<br/>\nlot more helpful if he started helping us think of alternative ways he could<br/>\nhelp, or how others could help or how we could get help ourselves. We&#39;d<br/>\nappreciate him helping us get our needs met.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it is with kids. They&#39;d like to know we&#39;re there to help them get their<br/>\nneeds met. When we first change our attitude, they will still hear &quot;No,<br/>\ncan&#39;t do that&quot; when we say &quot;How about this ..&quot; But they will eventually make<br/>\nthe shift from feeling they&#39;re approaching us for largess and approaching us<br/>\nfor help with a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
