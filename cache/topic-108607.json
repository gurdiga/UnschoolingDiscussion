She was glad; I didn&#39;t check back with him. &lt;<br/>\ng&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nStrangers have talked to me in grocery store lines and restaurants my whole <br/>\nlife, and some end up telling me about a death from which they haven&#39;t <br/>\nrecovered (maybe told lots of people, but for some reason people tell me their stuff). <br/>\n  One man I met at a medieval banquet sat and told me his wife had died <br/>\ntrying to save their son from drowning.   Both drowned.   There wasn&#39;t anything <br/>\nmore important for me to do then and there but to let him tell his story, and <br/>\ncomfort him.

I was with my younger cousin.  Apparently we were seen<br/>\nspeaking to this guy.  I got in big trouble later for talking to a<br/>\nstranger with my younger cousin.  I can remember being told that as I<br/>\nwas older I should know better.  But the guy was nice and chatty, and<br/>\nnothing bad happened.  And he didn&#39;t offer us candy, which I&#39;d been<br/>\nwarned about. And nothing happened, except that the adults got scared<br/>\nand didn&#39;t know what to do with that fear except to make me<br/>\naccountable for it.  I can understand the fear, but not really the<br/>\nmaking me accountable for it--I was 8, I think.  It didn&#39;t stop me<br/>\nlater from getting into a car with a guy from a diner I worked in who<br/>\noffered me drugs and then refused to take me and my friend home unless<br/>\nwe kissed him.  Nor did the knowledge that I shouldn&#39;t have taken a<br/>\nride from him keep me from getting me and my friend back home without<br/>\nkissing him (she was going to kiss him--I threatened to turn him into<br/>\nthe police, I think my tactic was probably the better choice).  Nor<br/>\ndid it stop me from taking a ride from a guy on a moped when I was<br/>\nwaiting for a bus to get to an art gallery opening that the artist had<br/>\ninvited me to.  The moped rider turned up the wrong street after<br/>\nfeeling up my leg, slowing just enough on the turn for me to jump off<br/>\nand flee for the bus which I caught before he came back for me. But,<br/>\nthem telling me not to talk to strangers kept me from telling my<br/>\nparents about any of those things happening to me. I have a friend who<br/>\nwas raped who didn&#39;t tell her mom because she had been told not to<br/>\ntalk to strangers and the fear of hearing &quot;I told you so&quot; kept her<br/>\nfrom being open when she could have used the support.  But it didn&#39;t<br/>\nkeep her from telling her friends at school about not accepting rides<br/>\nfrom strangers. I guess what I am saying is that my parents rule about<br/>\nnot talking to strangers only kept me from admitting my conversations<br/>\nwith strangers to them and didn&#39;t keep me from having them.    <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note The Jimmy Neutron movie is all about not talking to<br/>\nstrangers.
