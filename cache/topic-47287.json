Is it rude to just say Spaniels without<br/>\n&gt; saying Springer, Cocker, etc?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope. Also not rude to say you like retrievers or terriers, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I like that size range and personality.   Although my sister had a<br/>\n&gt; Brittany Spaniel, he was a little bigger.<br/>\n&gt; His name was Rodney and if you said ---would you rather be neutered or a<br/>\n&gt; dead dog--- he would fall over with his tongue hanging out.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>LOL! We&#39;ve always pointed our finger, gun-like, and said, &quot;Bang!&quot; as the<br/>\ncommand for &quot;play dead&quot; but I like your sister&#39;s better!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a Basenji.  These dogs were not a good idea.  I have a Shi tzu.<br/>\n&gt; Ditto.<br/>\n&gt; I end up with any dog or cat that other people, the people in their right<br/>\n&gt; minds, don&#39;t want.  And they all live to be 45 and they all have some<br/>\n&gt; kind of mental problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Only 45? &lt;g&gt; Basenjis are unique, that&#39;s for certain. You have to like that<br/>\nparticular personality (and noise). I don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband wants a Golden Retriever, he has the name picked out already.<br/>\n&gt; My son wants a Basset Hound, he writes poetry about them.   My city says<br/>\n&gt; two dogs and that&#39;s it, so for now I don&#39;t have to worry about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Goldens are practically perfect from birth -- some chewing stages to go<br/>\nthrough, but other than that they wrote the obedience manual. They are<br/>\nlimited in their intelligence, but brilliant within those limits (no NASA<br/>\nscientist knows more about trajectory than a Golden).<br/>\n<br/>\nBasset Hounds are marvelous sweet dogs who drool like fountains (and then<br/>\nshake their heads so that drippy foamy drool is glooping from everything in<br/>\nyour house -- there are dry mouthed Bassets but you can&#39;t always tell from<br/>\npuppyhood which ones they are!) and the other thing to know about Bassets<br/>\n(and any scenthound) is that once they put their nose to the ground and<br/>\ncatch a scent trail to follow, every brain cell they have is devoted to that<br/>\nand they will not see the oncoming truck about to mow them down, nor hear<br/>\nyou calling &quot;come back!&quot; so don&#39;t rely on their obedience training to keep<br/>\nthem safe -- they&#39;re not so much disobedient as they are so totally focused<br/>\nthey just can perceive anything but The Trail.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47278,"nextTopicId":47288}}
