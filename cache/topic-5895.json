We don t have cable (by choice), the kids do watch movies, but not all day long.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2111995293\">Beth,<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout TV watching, we have never really set any limits on <br/>\nthat.  We don&#39;t have cable (by choice), the kids do watch <br/>\nmovies, but not all day long.  Sometimes the boys spend too <br/>\nmuch time on the internet or playing video games, and that <br/>\nis something we have to be careful of - they get so <br/>\nhypnotized by these games that they can get very grouchy.  <br/>\nAnyway our decision to turn off the electronics for several <br/>\nhours a day has been a good one so far IMHO.  Yesterday <br/>\nZach got so engrossed in a book that he read half way <br/>\nthrough Pokemon (!!!!!!!), which was in our allowed TV <br/>\ntime.  I know that the longer we unschool, the more <br/>\ninterests the kids will develop and the less dependent they <br/>\nwill be on outside influences for entertainment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a new SAHM has presented some challenges.  I could <br/>\njust do housework all day, but I have to let it go and <br/>\nspend time with the kids.  It&#39;s hard for me to have a messy <br/>\nhouse, but I&#39;m learning.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, in regards to having some time for myself, I married <br/>\njust the most thoughtful man.  David actually suggested <br/>\nthat since I would be home with the kids all day that I <br/>\nwould need a mom&#39;s night out.  It surprised me, because <br/>\nmany husbands of SAHMs think that staying home all day is <br/>\nlike a vacation.  David is smart enough to know that <br/>\nstaying at home with all these kids and trying to teach <br/>\nthem something is one of the toughest jobs a mom (or dad)  <br/>\ncan do.  Anyway, you know I took him up on it and I&#39;ve been <br/>\ngoing to a ladies Bible study on Monday nights.  Sometimes <br/>\nI even go have coffee at Books a Million after and get home <br/>\nat a sinful 10pm &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid and I also lock ourselves in our room after 10pm <br/>\nevery night without fail.  We need our time - I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\ntrade that time for anything.  It revives me after a long <br/>\nday and prepares me for the next.  (this is also a no TV <br/>\nzone!!!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks for the helpful and supportive comments.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s why we&#39;re all here - isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy Wright<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Wright Way To Homeschool<br/>\nhttp://www.angelfire.com/fl3/homeschoolingwrights<br/>\ndeejay@...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;tt&gt;From:&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Beth Burnham&quot; &lt;beth2002@...&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;tt&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just read about the adjustment pd you wrote about on <br/>\n </span></blockquote>your web site!
