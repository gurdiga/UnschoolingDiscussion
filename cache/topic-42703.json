That&#39;s okay. I do wonder <br/>\nabout these &quot;conditions&quot; though. The one thing about unschooling I have tried <br/>\nto stress to Darin is that the kids will learn better this way (as opposed to <br/>\nthe rigors of a ps curriculum.) but for him not to expect them to pick up a <br/>\nmath book or ask for a history book. He says he understands, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink he does. I know that if Moly *had* to go to school starting tomorrow, <br/>\nshe would be ages ahead of the other kids (I think third grade?) in reading, <br/>\nbut miles behind in math. She would be all over the place with everything <br/>\nelse. Moly knows tons about the human body, but I don&#39;t think a typical third <br/>\ngrade curriculum covers that. So although she knows some *science* the <br/>\nteacher would probably assume we never studied any science at all. (true and <br/>\nnot true at the same time.) Moly could name many constellations, and knows <br/>\nall sorts of things about the planets. But if that wasn&#39;t what the teacher <br/>\nwas teaching at the time, she wouldn&#39;t be able to appreciate Moly&#39;s <br/>\nknowledge. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband Darin thinks homeschooling is a fine idea. (But) I get the <br/>\nimpression that he isn&#39;t too sure about all this *free learning*. He doesn&#39;t <br/>\nsay much, but every now and then he will make a small comment. Usually it <br/>\ngoes something like this. Moly is counting out her money. She has a pile of <br/>\nchange and some paper bills. She announces she has four dollars, 7 quarters, <br/>\n18 nickels, 5 dimes and 143 pennies. Darin says &quot;how much is that?&quot; and Moly <br/>\nsays, &quot;I just said how much I have.&quot; Darin will look at me, I am sure you <br/>\nknow that look. &lt;g&gt; and try to give Moly this 5 minute math lesson on how to <br/>\ncount her money. The first problem that comes up is she isn&#39;t wanting a <br/>\nlesson on counting money. Then there is the problem that she doesn&#39;t know how <br/>\nto add large numbers. So he tries to describe how to carry the one. She <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get that so he tries to tell her about number placement. It goes on <br/>\nand on and Moly gets bored and upset that her Dad isn&#39;t impressed with the <br/>\namount of money she has saved, rather he wants to turn everything into a <br/>\nlesson. Darin gets upset that Moly doesn&#39;t seem to want to know how to add up <br/>\nher money. Moly leaves and Darin says to me, &quot;I thought you started school <br/>\nalready.&quot; (meaning the public schooled kids have gone back, why haven&#39;t you <br/>\nstarted teaching our kids something?) I gently remind him that we don&#39;t do <br/>\nschool, we are learning all the time, the kids and I follow our interests. To <br/>\nwhich I usually hear, &quot;That&#39;s great, but when are you going to do math?&quot; He <br/>\njust doesn&#39;t get it and I doubt he ever will. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried to get him to read books on the subject, then I tried to get him <br/>\nto &quot;Just read this chapter honey!&quot; then I tried reading whatever paragraph <br/>\nhad just struck me as an extraordinarily, eye-opening, what ever idea I <br/>\nthought just might help him *get it*. I&#39;m going to try tapes next. He likes <br/>\nbooks on tape so maybe this will work! Someone else telling him what I have <br/>\nbeen saying all along, in their words. I think, over the years, he has come <br/>\nto accept it though. He knows the kids are smart. He is just so impressed <br/>\nwith the way Moly had taken to reading, and is always asking about what she <br/>\nis reading. But I am sure if there were worksheets with big gold stars, all <br/>\nover the fridge, he would be more comfortable. Marrying me has definitely put <br/>\nDarin outside his comfort zone! &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nMy best advice is, be gentle with it. For many people the idea of unschooling <br/>\ntakes time. So read little blurbs out loud, post short articles where he will <br/>\nfind them. Take the Field and Stream magazines out of the bathroom and put <br/>\nyour copy of The Homeschooling Handbook out, open to the unschooling chapter. <br/>\nSubscribe to Home Education Magazine and leave it open to that great article <br/>\non his side of the bed...<br/>\nGood Luck!<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] homeschooling books for reluctant dh&#39;s","postDate":"1031026848","msgId":42755,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDkwMjIxMTgwNi4wMWQxNGVjMEBwb3AuaXNsYW5kbmV0LmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFiYi41Yzc5NjU5LjJhYTU3OTk2QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":42753,"nextInTopic":42757,"prevInTime":42754,"nextInTime":42756,"topicId":42703,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
