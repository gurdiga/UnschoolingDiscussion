I was at a grocery store during the most recent Superbowl.  There was a TV playing near the cash register.  I knew it was after half time, and asked a young woman working there if she had enjoyed Paul McCartney in the half-time show.  She didn&#39;t know who he was!  (gasp!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Essential skills","postDate":"1120502957","msgId":107121,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFmYi5iZDBmMTM5LjJmZmFkZWFkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107120,"nextInTopic":107124,"prevInTime":107120,"nextInTime":107122,"topicId":107120,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Good points!

He said that he &quot;doesn&#39;t know how&quot; to type, so does it slowly, but his typing speed is compatible with his thinking while he is writing.  He also said that he fears if he used a computer that he would push the wrong button and delete stuff by accident.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis ties into the idea that there are certain things people &quot;have to learn&quot; in order to be successful.  McCullough is a very successful author without mastering the computer or learning &quot;correct&quot; keyboarding.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107148,"nextTopicId":107071}}
