That&#39;s the plan this year too. Room rates are $79 plus tax, the <br/>\nsame as last year---in a better (and safer&lt;G&gt;) hotel . And kids under 5 eat <br/>\nfree.<br/>\n<br/>\nPresenters are: S-P-A-M ---Sandra Dodd, Pam Sorooshian, Anne Ohman, and Mary <br/>\nGold. &lt;G&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can check out last year&#39;s website (which NEEDS to get hoppin&#39; SOON for <br/>\nTHIS year!) in my sig line.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe welcome dads and children. Non age-discriminatory---although some things <br/>\nare more age-appropriate than others.(and we&#39;ll have a room &#39;specially for <br/>\ntoddlers this year). And Ben will have some &quot;Dads Only&quot; sessions (at their <br/>\nrequest).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you can make it. &quot;Shot in the Arm&quot; is an understatement! Many said <br/>\nlast year was life-changing!!
