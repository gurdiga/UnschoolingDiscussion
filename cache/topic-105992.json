You might also consider <br/>\nhaving her thyroid function checked - underactive thyroid can slow <br/>\nmetabolism and lead to all sorts of other things (tiredness, <br/>\ndepression, when she gets older, reproductive issues, etc). It is <br/>\neasily corrected with medication in most cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s old enough to gather info with you, including what constitutes <br/>\na &quot;portion&quot; of meat or a &quot;portion&quot; of veggies or whatever. Many <br/>\nnutrition books use common objects as reference - for instance, <br/>\na &quot;serving&quot; of meat is the size of a deck of cards. That way there&#39;s <br/>\nnot a lot of tedious weighing and measuring, just a rough <br/>\neyeballing - maybe keep a deck of cards handy at first even.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, my first step would be a thorough physical (including a blood <br/>\ntest and all - blood test is the only way to confirm thyroid <br/>\nfunction as far as I know. That would help include or exclude <br/>\nphysiological issues little PWS. If there is something that needs <br/>\naddressing, address it *together*. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there isn&#39;t anything physiological, then look to what else is <br/>\nhappening - for instance, I read when I eat breakfast - it slows <br/>\ndown my eating so I can register when I&#39;m done (it takes something <br/>\nlike 20 minutes to register &quot;Full&quot; so if you eat rapidly, you can <br/>\neasily overeat) - at dinner, I have DH and DS to talk to but they&#39;re <br/>\nstill asleep when I eat breakfast. On the other hand, focusing on <br/>\nother things aside from what you are eating can also lead to &quot;robot&quot; <br/>\neating where you keep going and going without noticing that it&#39;s <br/>\nyour sixth cookie because you were wrapped up in a show about <br/>\nmummies. What works for each person will vary. Sometimes including a <br/>\nbeverage with the meal helps. Sometimes it creates a full feeling <br/>\ntoo quickly and precludes getting all the nutrients necessary from <br/>\nthe food. Does she eat out of boredom? stress? control needs? is it <br/>\nalways or at specific times of day? specific types of food? in <br/>\nparticular situations (like is it more likely if you&#39;ve been running <br/>\nerrands all morning)? Is she &#39;allowed&#39; regular high fiber and <br/>\nprotein snacks (whole grain crackers and cheese for instance)? Is <br/>\nshe eating mostly high-glycemic foods? They cause spikes and drops <br/>\nin blood sugar which can cause a feeling of &quot;hunger&quot;.

I have an 8 (almost 9yo) <br/>\ndaughter who is not able to tell when she is full.  She ends up eating <br/>\nbeyond a point of fullness and gets stomach aches and sometimes sick.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t allow her freedom of eating because of this (she has had <br/>\nfreedom in the past and she eats till she is sick and she is also <br/>\noverweight because her metabolism is very slow).

Right now she can eat when she is hungry, but I control the <br/>\nportion size so she doesn&#39;t over eat and get sick.  If she still feels <br/>\nhungry after what I give her, I ask her to have a glass of water and <br/>\nwait 15 minutes, if she still feels hungry, she can have more.
