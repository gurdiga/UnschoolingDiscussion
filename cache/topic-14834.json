But hearing everyone talking about what their toddlers call it, makes<br/>\nme laugh - I learnt the hard way that an obscure word or phrase might be<br/>\nbetter. When #2 was about 3 1/2 we were at a homeschool gathering, I was in the<br/>\nmiddle of setting out lunch for the starving millions, including my own older<br/>\nchild, when #2 started asking for milk. I said &#39;no, wait till I have finished<br/>\nsetting out lunch&#39; - I knew it wasn&#39;t &#39;urgent&#39;, he was just hungry and bored,<br/>\nand once lunch was out, would just as happily have a sandwich and then go play<br/>\n(please believe me on this, I knew this particular behavoiur pattern).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, he asked again for milk, and again I said &#39;wait&#39;, where upon another<br/>\nmother, glaring at me, commented that there was no need for him to wait, and<br/>\nbefore I could explain, handed him a glass of cold cow&#39;s milk from the carton<br/>\nin the fridge. The look of disgust on his face was priceless - as was the look<br/>\nof horror on the woman&#39;s face as my ds hurled the glass, contents and all,<br/>\nstraight at her!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the other nice things that happenned, which goes to show you shouldn&#39;t<br/>\njudge people by appearances, happened at a party we had at our house as a<br/>\nfarewell for one of dh&#39;s workmates who was leaving the country. Ds #2 (again)<br/>\nthis time 4 1/2yo, fell and hurt himself quite badly. You guessed it - after<br/>\nbeing mopped up by dh, all he wanted to do was nurse. I was sitting with about<br/>\nfour guys, 3 parents, and one about 19, loud, foul-mouthed, full of grubby<br/>\njokes.... you get the picture. Along comes this huge 4 1/2 yo and this awful<br/>\nwoman (me) picks him up and starts nursing him!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the 3 fathers, quickly left, looking slightly ill. The aforementioned<br/>\n19yo moved slightly to cover me from view from the rest of the room, said &#39;my<br/>\nmum nursed all of us till we were qite old, I can still remember it&#39; then sat<br/>\nand chatted to me the whole time :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw him for the first time in years about a month ago, in a bar at a get<br/>\ntogether of dh&#39;s old work mates. He still tells rude jokes, made sexist<br/>\ncomments about attractive women who walked into the bar, etc. but how could I<br/>\nhate him? I will always see past the bravado to the sweet sensitive guy that I<br/>\nsaw that day all those years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sue","from":"&quot;Sue&quot; &lt;sue.m.e@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"3Qt60R7Etf6lTxHE3LrwMNBKHt9dFs4Eq6PaPwFoDBtjmRZhv45WhAajmwd8BaBIEpqfB8swzXKnhX1nTcbPZlo2wQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:  Nursing Toddlers","postDate":"978361340","msgId":14835,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGYwMWMwNzQwMyRkN2E2NTUyMCQ5ZTBmYTNkMUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDk3ODM0NTk4NC4yNDE0OUBlZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDAwNTUwMWMwNzQwMyQzZDE1M2RhMCQ4ZGRlZmVhOUB0aWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":14834,"nextInTopic":14837,"prevInTime":14834,"nextInTime":14836,"topicId":14834,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... bedtime, ...
