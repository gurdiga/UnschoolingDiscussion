He <br/>\nalso suggested that because my son was very intelligent he had a <br/>\nknowledge base that exceeded his emotional maturity.   i.e. He had <br/>\nthe normal fears of a young child his chronological age, but a much <br/>\nolder child&#39;s view of the world and therefore more things to worry <br/>\nabout.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember one incident when my son was three. I was called to come <br/>\nto his preschool.  He was crying and very upset.  He was normally a <br/>\nhappy, even-mannered little guy.  The staff couldn&#39;t get him to <br/>\nexplain and they were greatly concerned that something had happened <br/>\nto him.  When I got there and had calmed him down he told me that he <br/>\nwas afraid he was going to die.  He said they had had pizza for lunch <br/>\nand it was kind of greasy.  He explained to us that he was afraid he <br/>\nwas &quot;going to die of high cholesterol intake. You know, the build-up <br/>\nof fatty tissue in your arteries.&quot;  (This kid spoke in full sentences <br/>\nat age ten months.  He would often use big words and then add a <br/>\ndefinition.

He had apparently been listening in on a <br/>\nTV program on health issues I had been watching the night before and <br/>\nwas &quot;re-thinking&quot; (his term) about this program just before nap time. <br/>\nThat evening we had a long talk about what he could do whenever he <br/>\nwas &quot;re-thinking&quot; about something and it got scary.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver time we&#39;ve had lots of conversations about &quot;re-thinking&quot; about <br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nJan in Marysville  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; Maybe Zak thinks the smoke detectors can CAUSE a fire.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good thought!
