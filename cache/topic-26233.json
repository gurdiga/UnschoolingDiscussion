My son is allergic to dairy and eggs, since <br/>\nbirth, but now I&#39;m wondering about other stuff too.  Seems like I&#39;ve heard <br/>\nsomeone talk about preservatives and other unnatural stuff, just wanted a bit <br/>\nmore specific info.  Like he gets wired on sugar, but sometimes when he has <br/>\ncandy, he behaves like he&#39;s had dairy or eggs.  I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s dyes or <br/>\npreservatives or something. So just wondering what were allergies for other <br/>\nkids. Any feedback would be great....Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26049,"nextTopicId":26231}}
