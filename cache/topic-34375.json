We just got our new swarm in last week.  We tried <br/>\nlast year and lost three queens to various demises.  This year&#39;s swarm <br/>\nseems SOOOoooo much healthier.  They aren&#39;t really our bees exactly.  <br/>\nOne of our friends has been keeping bees for years and he wanted to <br/>\nuse corner of our property in exchange for half the honey.  So they <br/>\nare sort of jointly owned bees.  <br/>\nWe did get a whole lot of beewax out of the deal though.  He gave us <br/>\nlast year&#39;s frames to melt the wax out of since they may be deseased.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"What are y&#39;all doing?","postDate":"1018463517","msgId":34375,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTUwMWMxZTBiZSQwOTE3MTQwMCRjZTgwZWU0MEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMTg0NjAyMDkuMTcxNi4xMzE2Mi5tMTBAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":34455,"prevInTime":34374,"nextInTime":34376,"topicId":34375,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This morning: Adriane (11) went to milk her goat but the babies got loose this morning and helped themselves to breakfast so she is figuring out how to secure","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-605832750\">This morning:<br/>\n<br/>\nAdriane (11) went to milk her goat but the babies got loose this morning and<br/>\nhelped themselves to breakfast so she is figuring out how to secure the pen.<br/>\nShe just got back from a sewing project for 4-H and finished a small quilt<br/>\nthat folds into a pillow.<br/>\n<br/>\nZach (8) got the little kids breakfast in exchange for me taking care of his<br/>\nrabbits this morning since we were in a hurry to get Adriane to her project.<br/>\nHe is finishing his laundry (had to wash a baseball uniform) and playing a<br/>\ncombination of pool and hot wheels with his sister.
