If you want to go south, there is the Philadelphia <br/>\nZoo and the Camden Aquarium, not to mention the Franklin Institute and <br/>\nNatural History Museum.  There is also a fairly impressive art museum in <br/>\nPhiladelphia.  If you have any extra time, we&#39;d love to meet with you.  My <br/>\nkids are 6 and 4 as well.  Let me know if that is a possibility.  We have <br/>\nmemberships to the zoo, the aquarium and the Franklin Institute.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a good time and let me know if you need any more info,<br/>\n<br/>\nBonnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Cindy Ferguson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nTo: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:home-ed@...\">home-ed@...</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:home-ed@...\">home-ed@...</a>&gt;, &quot;us.com&quot; <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] things to see and do in NJ<br/>\nDate: Sun, 17 Jun 2001 22:35:27 -0700<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister is getting married in New Brunswick, NJ in Aug and we<br/>\nare planning on attending.  One of my brothers lives in Montclair<br/>\nso we will be in that area too. What are good activities for a 4<br/>\nyear old and a 6 year old?  We are willing to drive and are planning<br/>\na visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Natural History<br/>\nMuseum one day.  I figure the Ellis Island/Statue of Liberty visits<br/>\nare better done when they are older and have learned more about US<br/>\nhistory.  Any suggestions of good things to do would be appreciated.<br/>\nWe would like day trip suggestions since we want to stay in one area<br/>\nfor our entire visit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy Ferguson<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22624,"nextTopicId":22644}}
