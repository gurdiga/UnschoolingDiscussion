By <br/>\neven bringing it up I&#39;m perching on the very edge of my own personal grasp of <br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut - what I&#39;ve learned from some people is that the kind of &quot;taking care&quot; <br/>\nthat Sandra just posted about in terms of careful reading of people&#39;s emails <br/>\nbefore responding or careful attention to detail or careful attention to <br/>\nintegrity - is a way of being that transcends everything or maybe it is more <br/>\naccurate to say it permeates everything and gives everything we do a deeper <br/>\nmeaning. It is maybe comparable to how an artist sees with an artist&#39;s eyes - <br/>\nso that everything is made up of shapes and lines and space and color and <br/>\npattern - and the most mundane items become unordinary - beautiful or <br/>\nmeaningful. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat kind of &quot;taking care&quot; is a way of &quot;seeing&quot; everything as &quot;sacred&quot; - in <br/>\nthe sense that everything matters, even the most mundane and the most <br/>\nseemingly trivial things.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, unschooling is largely about that kind of &quot;taking care&quot; -- especially <br/>\ntaking care of my children&#39;s inner core of natural love of life - which <br/>\nincludes their intrinsic urge to learn. To do that, it means applying that <br/>\n&quot;taking care&quot; to the mundane things in everyday life - making as many of them <br/>\nas possible into sacred and wonderful moments where we are fully and <br/>\nimmediately present with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: A moderator interruption [how to be right]","postDate":"1022509706","msgId":37508,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2Ny5lNTEyMGJhLjJhMjM5YzhhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37585,"prevInTime":37507,"nextInTime":37509,"topicId":37508,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been gone for almost two days, and need to leave today for several more hours (to help bring the camp back home, which will take three pickup loads, my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1776857132\">I&#39;ve been gone for almost two days, and need to leave today for several more <br/>\nhours (to help bring the camp back home, which will take three pickup loads, <br/>\nmy van at least once, and two other cars--medieval villages aren&#39;t <br/>\nbackpacking situations!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read through this thread and might comment more later, but here are a <br/>\nfew things which struck me as vital to share, and they&#39;re things I have <br/>\nalways shared with my kids, too.  It was a good kid-weekend, and I got lots <br/>\nof positive feedback on my kids.  Kirby got an award of arms (and is now Lord <br/>\nMagnus Gunwaldtsson instead of just plain &quot;Magnus&quot;), and Marty was made a <br/>\nmember of the Order of The Desert Fawn, which is only for kids whose work an <br/>\npotential are inspiring even to the adults.  Good feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my sharings (which I have shared with my kids) are these:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way to be truthful is not to speak unless you&#39;ve carefully checked your <br/>\nfacts and thought about what you&#39;re going to say.  Thinking before talking is <br/>\nsomething we&#39;ve encouraged always in our kids, and they got it as kids, not <br/>\nhaving to figure it out later as adults.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re wrong, don&#39;t dodge.  If you make an error of fact, accept the <br/>\ncorrection, admit you were wrong, and go on!  Digging in and defending <br/>\nsomething which isn&#39;t true leads to no good, and you lose integrity points <br/>\nand people lose faith in you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the SCA (which has been a big part of our lives, and was the overwhelming <br/>\npart of life this weekend) there are people who are trusted and dependable, <br/>\nand they created and maintain that reputation by attention each moment to <br/>\nwhat they&#39;re doing and saying.  There are people my kids have known all their <br/>\nlives, whom I&#39;ve known twenty-five years, who have not in all that time lost <br/>\nthe positive regard of other people.   It&#39;s a goal in their lives, and they <br/>\njust do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other people my kids also know who are NOT reliable, NOT considered <br/>\ngood sources of information or assistance, and that&#39;s just how it is.  They <br/>\nlook at both kinds of people and their choices in life are easier to make.  <br/>\nThere are people who used to be unreliable and less than truthful and less <br/>\nthan honest who have turned their lives around consciously and become <br/>\nrespected, high-ranking participants.  One was in our camp, one of my <br/>\nstudents (now a knight).  This isn&#39;t lost on my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s godfather, Sir Raymond the Quiet, who was knighted in 1971 or (before <br/>\nI joined), had a heart attack on Saturday and was taken to the hospital.  <br/>\nAngioplasty, probably home today.   For those reading who are <br/>\nSCA-knowledgeable, Raymond was the founding baron here, and is a triple peer. <br/>\n If he says something is so, it is so.   Not because he&#39;s a peer, but the <br/>\nother way around.  If he doesn&#39;t know he finds no shame in saying &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow, but I&#39;ll try to find out.&quot;  He makes (mostly cast bronze and silver) <br/>\njewelry reproductions.  I watched his booth for a bit Saturday afternoon, and <br/>\nMost pieces were displayed on top of a color print of a painting or <br/>\narcheological photograph.  Those which were based but not copied exactly from <br/>\nhistory were displayed on a photo of the original piece.  It was clear by the <br/>\nbackgrounds which were which.  In no way whatsoever was the sales place of <br/>\nthese 150 or so different items misleading or &quot;wrong.&quot;  Each piece was <br/>\ndescribed straightforwardly and plainly.<br/>\n<br/>\nRay&#39;s been a friend of mine for a long time.  Many people&#39;s lifetimes.  He <br/>\njust won&#39;t say things he doesn&#39;t know to be so, or know could prove useful to <br/>\nthe listeners.  There are many such people in my life, and in my kids&#39; lives. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHe said he had been working on his website lately.  I haven&#39;t looked since I <br/>\nspoke with him about that Saturday, before the heart attack, but here is the <br/>\nlink:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.quietpress.com/\">http://www.quietpress.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other preliminary comment I have about the thread is about whether I&#39;m <br/>\nflattered when people discuss me and argue over my comments.  I am not <br/>\nflattered.  It&#39;s irritating like being stalked.  But how can it be prevented? <br/>\n I could go away, I could be less honest, I could water down my advice.  But <br/>\nI couldn&#39;t do that and maintain my integrity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who focus on me instead of on unschooling are showing something about <br/>\nthemselves, their own growth and confidence and sureness about the world.  If <br/>\nI&#39;m trying to keep things clearly focussed and others (not many, a couple <br/>\nfrom time to time) are expending energy to say &quot;Clarity isn&#39;t all that,&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;My clarity is as clear as yours is&quot; that&#39;s kind of an embarrassing moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t need to (nor can we) take turns &quot;being right.&quot;  This began because I <br/>\nstated what I saw clearly, and stated it simply.  Having been proven right, I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t come in and do a happy dance.  It was a simple fact.  Had looking at <br/>\nthe first post proven wrong, I would have said &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry.  You&#39;re right. <br/>\n Sorry for the confusion.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I looked carefully at the first post before I ever wrote anything in the <br/>\nfirst place, and that&#39;s why I was right.  Because I&#39;ve learned over the years <br/>\nthe value of being careful about what I say and write and do.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is a respected man in the SCA.  He&#39;s always right.  People respect <br/>\nhis word in meetings, about site maps, about schedules and policies.  If it <br/>\never turns out he&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s usually because a policy was changed after he <br/>\nlearned it.  And he admits being wrong with sweet honesty.  And then other <br/>\nsay, &quot;No, you would have been right if they hadn&#39;t changed the schedule this <br/>\nmorning.&quot;  If he dug in his heels and insulted those who disputed him and <br/>\nclaimed to be right just because he was him, the respect would start to <br/>\nerode, but he doesn&#39;t.  He knows the harm that comes to reputations from <br/>\ndefending an indefensible position, and I have never seen him do that.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s &quot;always right&quot; not because I say he is, but because those who have tried <br/>\nto trip him up by finding error have failed to do that.  He&#39;s not right for <br/>\nmeanness nor out of arrogance or anything bad or evil.  He&#39;s just right <br/>\nbecause he&#39;s careful.  He&#39;s truthful because he values truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would be off topic if it weren&#39;t the very topic itself, and if it <br/>\nweren&#39;t something that my three unschooled kids have learned from example and <br/>\nosmosis and reminder and discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37579,"nextTopicId":37514}}
