There were several boxes of this musical light-up gizmo and one box<br/>\n&gt; that was slightly different.  Same toy, older packaging.  I read the virtues<br/>\n&gt; of this toy, and the old box listed FUN!  On the new boxes there was no such<br/>\n&gt; word.

Toys and games are &quot;educational&quot; and Public School<br/>\nis sold as FUN. It&#39;s another example of all the reversals taking place in<br/>\nsociety and the schools.   Reading is taught as therapy instead of skill.<br/>\nSex is taught as an &quot;activity&quot; to public school kids, while morality is<br/>\n&quot;relative&quot; and situational ethics. God and the commandments were<br/>\nreplaced(not that I favor religion in those schools) by a priesthood of<br/>\nemployees and unions with different rules.  Failure is not possible in<br/>\nschool any more (problem is, neither is success)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd pre-unschooling programs have curricula. Go figger. No wonder we have to<br/>\nask, Am I crazy?<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41102,"nextTopicId":41109}}
