It&#39;s how they deal with serious emotions too.<br/>\nPlay and art are often the only way they have to deal with these <br/>\nserious issues.<br/>\nIt&#39;s best to calmly respond with non-judgmental comments. Instead of <br/>\nre-directing them (they weren&#39;t hurting anything and didn&#39;t need re-<br/>\ndirection at that time) you could say &quot;oh really?&quot; or &quot;what happened <br/>\nto the baby?&quot; You might have gotten clues about real life, from <br/>\ntheir fantasy play.<br/>\nThey may have seen something on tv, or be affected by the war or any <br/>\nnumber of real life situations, or simply be concerned about death <br/>\nand what it all means. But you won&#39;t find out if the play gets <br/>\nshamed. Open dialogue won&#39;t happen if they think their play is &quot;bad&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to explore the feelings and issues without judgement or re-<br/>\ndirection next time. I&#39;m very sure that no one will get hurt by <br/>\npretending a baby is dead or hurt, though it IS a serious and sad <br/>\nmatter in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer interest in death is something she needs to explore right now. <br/>\nHow about indulge her interest by getting children&#39;s books on the <br/>\ntopic, discussing feelings and thoughts about death and maybe even <br/>\nhaving your own Day of the Dead celebration and honor those in your <br/>\nfamily that have died? It&#39;s a real life issue, and real life <br/>\nlearning happens when there is interest. Society tends to shun <br/>\nuncomfortable subjects, but we&#39;re unschoolers!! So dive right in.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92752,"nextTopicId":93243}}
