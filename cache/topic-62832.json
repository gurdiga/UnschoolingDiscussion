Quite cool!)  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nVery cool story.  I&#39;ll send it to my boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast Saturday they had a very interesting experience at their Saturday night <br/>\nD&D game.  Their DM/leader had decided to switch games to some new <br/>\npost-apocalyptic game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was still up when they got in 1:30 a.m. or so, and I&#39;m glad because I got <br/>\nthe immediate debrief.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was impressed (side story) that neither of them ever got impatient with the <br/>\nother for interrupting as this story came tumbling out.  Several times one <br/>\nwould take over or clarify or back up and the other would let him go until <br/>\nthe need to clarify or back up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo out poured this:<br/>\n<br/>\nEach person was to be playing himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So did you roll stats?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd both the boys&#39; eyes just sparkled and they said &quot;NO! We used our real <br/>\nstats!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI settled in for a story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe method was for everyone to state what the individual had as to dexterity, <br/>\nintelligence, charisma, etc. and they negotiated an agreeable stat for each.  <br/>\n15 was the limit, and nobody was to be below average, which they set at 8.  <br/>\nSo 8 was the lowest and 15 was the highest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked if anyone got a 15 charisma.  Kirby smirked and pointed to himself <br/>\nwith two thumbs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about strength?  I looked at Marty.  They had given him a thirteen, <br/>\nwhich he thought was fine.  I had guessed him as the strongest of those I <br/>\nknew.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut their main good story was intelligence.  When it came time to decide <br/>\nintelligence on everybody, their host (a school-boy I know well) said &quot;I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to say anything about homeschooling, but...&quot;   and when they told <br/>\nme I laughed and said &quot;But he just did!&quot; and they nodded and said, &quot;Yeah, we <br/>\nknow.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in his summary of what intelligence was, it was clarified that <br/>\nintelligence was knowing things like chemistry and science.   I rared back my <br/>\nhead and said &quot;That&#39;s knowledge.  Intelligence is how easily you can learn <br/>\nthings.&quot;  Both Kirby and Marty nodded quickly and gave the eye look and head <br/>\nnot that means, &quot;OH yeah, we know that, but Eric and the rest of them don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEric did say as consolation to Kirby and Marty while telling them they were <br/>\nintelligence-impaired, that they did both have the most common sense of the <br/>\npeople in that group.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Kirby was granted a 13 intelligence, and Marty a 12, I believe.  Not bad <br/>\nunder the prejudicial circumstances. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty had gotten a 13 charisma too.  Not Kirby&#39;s 15, because Marty is loud <br/>\nand obnoxious sometimes.  Cruder humor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nClosest they&#39;ve ever had to report cards.  And the summations came from kids <br/>\nwho had spent many hours with them in close social, linguistic and logical <br/>\ncircumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were about twelve of the sometimes fifteen there.  Two other longtime <br/>\nhomeschoolers weren&#39;t there.  One who was there homeschooled from about <br/>\n12-15, and now is taking some low-level college stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the two who weren&#39;t there, one is full-time in college, a sophomore.  So <br/>\nthey probaby would have given her a 15 on intelligence.  Not that she doesn&#39;t <br/>\ndeserve it, but they would have looked at college GPA and gone straight with <br/>\nthat.   The other works full time and can think circles around my kids, but <br/>\nhe&#39;s a cowboy kid with less social status than some of them (in their eyes) <br/>\nand so that will probably prejudice their decision when he shows up for the <br/>\npost-apocalyptic doings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was fascinated and amused.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62822,"nextTopicId":62690}}
