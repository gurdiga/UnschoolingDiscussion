Anyhow, <br/>\nI have been homeschooling since Dec. and only unschooling since Feb.<br/>\nI was just wondering how long do I just sit back and let her <br/>\n(Kearstin-81/2Yog) &quot;Deschool&quot;? She just wants to watch T.V., shes up <br/>\ntill all hours of the night. And I noticed a great increase in <br/>\nappetite and gaining weight!! (getting nervous) We go to the library <br/>\nonce a week and she gets alot of videos on animals and stuff like that<br/>\nmostly national geographic. And I thought she wasnt learning anything<br/>\nbut Im getting nervous about all the hanging around so I started a <br/>\ngame of 20 questions in the car and she picked animals as her cat. <br/>\nshe did really good on exotic animals but couldnt figure out what cat <br/>\nwas? (maybe too obvious?) We have not covered any other subjects and <br/>\nwhen I bring anything up she gets aggravated with me. We havent even <br/>\nthought about testing yet, and even though my state (NH) is pretty <br/>\neasy to please, it is getting late in the season and now Im afraid to <br/>\ntest her. Has anyone heard of the PASS Test and do you know anything <br/>\nabout it? I have noticed a big difference in her attitude which to me <br/>\naught to be good enough I thought that was a great feat. She lapses <br/>\ninto that &quot;Cocky&quot; attitude every once in a while but just a look gets <br/>\nrid of it. and we are a little more like partners now , I think we <br/>\nneed a little more practice but were getting there. Well Id like to <br/>\nhear from anyone one who has a hard time to be patient. And the <br/>\nwaiting game is giving me a.....(I dont know, something though)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Everyone<br/>\nTamie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8396,"nextTopicId":7098}}
