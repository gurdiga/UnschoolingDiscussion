Its a long story of why I did it that way, but I <br/>\nwanted to suggest to you that there are cruises that are looking for waiters, <br/>\nand you live on the ship for a summer or a semester, you make a lot of money <br/>\nbecause all your expenses are paid, and you get to go somewhere like Mexico, <br/>\nCosta Rica, etc.  maybe this would be a good option for him, at least to save <br/>\nup the money to move wehre he wants.  Also he could try youth hostils, which <br/>\nare supposed to be fairly cheap, and I know in Seattle there are resteraunts <br/>\nthat provide housing in trade for no paycheck (although you do get tips, and <br/>\nI am told this is a pretty good deal).  The maint hing is that he get out <br/>\nthere, and you get a 1800 number!!  (ITs cheapest that way!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you sound like you are doing all you can.  how about leaving the <br/>\nTeenage Liberation Handbook somewhere where he will find it?  Its excellent <br/>\nand I wish I had it when I was that age, just so I would have known that what <br/>\nI was doing was great!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck-- you are brave to encourage him to move away from you, because I <br/>\nam a mother now and can imagine that would make you sad.

It is refreshing to hear about someone with a son whom they<br/>\nencourage to be independent.  In my family the boys were SOOOOOO spoiled.<br/>\nMy brother (27) lives with my parents still (along with his wife and two<br/>\nchildren) because he does not know what he wants to be when he grows up and<br/>\ndoes not make enough money right now to support his family.  I keep telling<br/>\nthem that he needs to get a different job and move away (far away) from our<br/>\nparents so he can learn how to be responsible for himself and be truly &quot;on<br/>\nhis own.&quot;  His wife could not agree more.  She is in school full time, has<br/>\nfinished her degree and has another year to complete her certification to<br/>\nteach High School.  She is absolutely sick to death of being nagged and<br/>\n&quot;mothered&quot; by my/his mom, who is definately the intrusive type.  I think he<br/>\nwould live there happily forever if nobody pushes him.
