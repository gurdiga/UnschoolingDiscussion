First, I didn&#39;t realize that this<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; particular group was open to flaming and derogatory statements to<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; other members; you have made me see that it is perfectly fine (at<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; least in your eyes).  What a shame!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Second, I don&#39;t know where you get your misinformation about other<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; religious groups or all of their member&#39;s beliefs, but it is<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; definitely that: MISINFORMATION!!  I also don&#39;t know what tragic<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; experiences you&#39;ve had with any of the mentioned groups that would<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; make you so malicious and unkind to others, or what would make you<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; think that you are some kind of spokesperson for groups that you<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; obviously don&#39;t belong to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;And last, your statements and opinions seem to reflect those of an<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; intolerant and unstable mind (much like the abortion clinic<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; terrorists).  Your vehement reaction to my personal beliefs was<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; entirely uncalled for and have forced myself and others off of this<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; message board.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Remember how this all got started?  You seem to have no qualms about<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; letting others know how you feel about them or their beliefs but seem<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; very intolerant to anyone who&#39;s belief is different than yours.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again, what a shame.  I do believe that there is therapy and<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; medications out there that may help you work some of this out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Chris<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;P.S.

The mother came from a Catholic family<br/>\n&gt; with 8 children and the father was adopted by two Catholic parents.<br/>\n&gt; Tina&#39;s mother grew up poor and Tina&#39;s grandfather was an an<br/>\n&gt; alcoholic.  Tina&#39;s father grew up rich, yet physically abused.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After dating for a year or so, Tina was concieved and Tina&#39;s parents<br/>\n&gt; decided to get married and Tina was born in 1968.  The marriage was a<br/>\n&gt; horrible one; Tina&#39;s father turned out to be a physically, mentally,<br/>\n&gt; emotionally and sexually abusive man.  Tina and her mother lived with<br/>\n&gt; the abuse and alcoholism for 10 years.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tina&#39;s mom remarried later and her dad, well he ended up dying in a<br/>\n&gt; barroom fight when she was 13.  Tina turned to drugs & alcohol and<br/>\n&gt; much promiscuity.  At the end of high school she met someone special<br/>\n&gt; and spent 5 years with him.  Tina called off their engagement by<br/>\n&gt; spending the night with someone else and very high off of her alcohol<br/>\n&gt; and drugs.  She dated this guy for a couple of months then found out<br/>\n&gt; that she was pregnant by him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tina had a good job, medical insurance and a place of her own and<br/>\n&gt; turned to her mother and friend for support.  Well, it was understood<br/>\n&gt; that she should just have an abortion.  After all, she was on the<br/>\n&gt; pill since age 14 and had had many lovers over the course of her<br/>\n&gt; teens and early 20&#39;s.  Everything she had learned in school, from her<br/>\n&gt; friends, and from her family all pointed to the practicality of an<br/>\n&gt; abortion.  Nobody even asked her if she wanted to keep the baby.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Counselling at the abortion clinic was the equivolent of &quot;Are you<br/>\n&gt; sure you want an abortion?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;Okay&quot;.  And at 6 weeks the baby<br/>\n&gt; was terminated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Time goes on and Tina gets back with her boyfriend from high school<br/>\n&gt; and she decides, at age 23, after her abortion, that it&#39;s time to<br/>\n&gt; shape herself up.  Her and Jim get married and after 10 years of<br/>\n&gt; marriage have 4 children.  Life is good for her and her family.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tina looks back at her life and says, &quot;Thank God my grandmother<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t abort any of her 8 children.&quot;, &quot;Thank God that, no matter how<br/>\n&gt; mentally ill my father was that he was adopted and wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; aborted.&quot;  &quot;Thank God for my life, my love of life and the wisdom and<br/>\n&gt; knowledge to choose life, always.&quot;  &quot;Dear God, why are there people<br/>\n&gt; out their that would judge, condemn and terminate our lives just<br/>\n&gt; because of the extremely unfortunate circumstances many of us have?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The moral of the above story is that this young lady was born into<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;undesireable life&quot; many have described.  Many of the posts would<br/>\n&gt; have had Tina and her parents terminated based on genetics or life-<br/>\n&gt; circumstances.  Tina herself chose to terminate life based on life-<br/>\n&gt; circumstances.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tina, as an adult mother of 4, is PRO-LIFE based on experience and<br/>\n&gt; life-circumstances.
