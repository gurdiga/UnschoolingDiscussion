Called &quot;A Dark <br/>\nSide to Home Schooling,&quot; it singled out cases of abuse and <br/>\ndeath at the hands of home-school parents  and left the <br/>\nimpression the problem is rampant. <br/>\n<br/>\nSpecifically, &quot;The CBS Evening News with Dan Rather&quot; report <br/>\nsaid: &quot;A CBS News investigation found dozens of cases of <br/>\nparents accused or convicted of child abuse or murder who <br/>\nwere teaching their children at home.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWendy Jeub, who teaches her children at home, said she <br/>\nwas offended by the story  which paints home schooling <br/>\nwith a very broad brush.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;(CBS is) blaming home schooling for abuse, neglect and <br/>\neven murder,&quot; Jeub said. &quot;It&#39;s like blaming the public schools <br/>\nfor any crime that&#39;s ever been committed by a public school <br/>\nstudent.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Klicka, an attorney with the Home School Legal <br/>\nDefense Association, said someone is out to discredit <br/>\nthe home-school movement and is using CBS to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;(These allegations) couldn&#39;t be further from the truth, and <br/>\nthis is really inaccurate and unprofessional reporting,&quot; Klicka <br/>\nsaid. &quot;I definitely think that there are certain elite (members <br/>\nof) the education communities in America who do have some <br/>\nsway with the media.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said this report might be the first of many attacks in the <br/>\nmainstream media.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We think the honeymoon (home schooling has had) with the <br/>\npress is over,&quot; Klicka said. &quot;They&#39;ve been with us for the most <br/>\npart over the last 20 years; we have been considered the <br/>\nunderdog.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTAKE ACTION/FOR MORE INFORMATION<br/>\nTo view an online version of the report that CBS aired, visit <br/>\ntheir Web site and click on &quot;Home School Nightmares.&quot; Your <br/>\ncomputer must have a media player installed in order to <br/>\nview the report.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do not have the needed media player to view the video <br/>\nversion, please visit the CBS Website to read the condensed <br/>\nversion of their story &quot;A Dark Side to Home Schooling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo contact Dan Rather with your views on home schooling, <br/>\nplease see the following link from CitizenLink&#39;s Legislative <br/>\nAction Center.<br/>\n<br/>\n(NOTE: Referral to Web sites not produced by Focus on the <br/>\nFamily is for informational purposes only and does not <br/>\nnecessarily constitute an endorsement of the sites&#39; content.)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82835,"nextTopicId":82910}}
