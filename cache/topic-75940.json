I have a friend who can sew---she whipped it out <br/>\nin one afternoon---he could NOT have been more thrilled! He hasn&#39;t taken it <br/>\noff except to sleep! &lt;G&gt; Gillian&#39;s husband spent the day with him. He wore it <br/>\ntoday to the grocery and to K-mart.  Patrick says that Duncan was oblivious, but <br/>\nthat every child who saw him was SOOO envious! Eyes like saucers!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got a Simplicity pattern. There are three children on the front: a boy <br/>\nwith glasses and a black robe with silver and purple trim, a girl with a wand, <br/>\nand another boy with a gold-ish robe. Duncan picked out a black robe with red <br/>\ntrim and sparkly-silvery-with moons-and-stars sleeves. The black hat has <br/>\nyellow-gold lining. The pattern calls for a hook & eye closing. Gillian put a &quot;tie&quot; <br/>\nat the neck instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, Duncan and Patrick got a dowel. Duncan sawed it to the &quot;perfect&quot; <br/>\nlength and then painted it red (to match)!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s just too cute!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Harry Potter Robe/ Kelly","postDate":"1057183774","msgId":75993,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdiLjE0YmM5M2I5LjJjMzRiMjFlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":75940,"nextInTopic":76003,"prevInTime":75992,"nextInTime":75994,"topicId":75940,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/2/03 10:52:13 AM Eastern Daylight Time, ...
