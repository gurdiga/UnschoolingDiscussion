He&#39;s had them since he was three.  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;We have tried to figure out what is causing them.  Protein sometimes <br/>\n&gt;&gt;helps, but not always.  Sleep always helps.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A little caffeine used to help me. Maybe a small glass of Pepsi as he feels <br/>\none coming on? Sounds counter-intuitive, I know, but it helped with <br/>\nconstricting the blood vessels in my head to slow the pounding.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I think he gets pinched nerves in his neck (like I do) which can cause <br/>\n&gt;&gt;major headaches!  I think the above experience is because he sits at the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;computer all slumped over.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe teach him the stretches and relaxation techniques that they recommend <br/>\nto people who work in offices? Help him get up for frequent stretch and <br/>\nmovement breaks. Not so that he has to get off or lose his turn, just so <br/>\nthat he moves himself around for a few minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;It&#39;s him coming over to me and saying, &quot;Mom, I&#39;m hungry.&quot; So I say, &quot;Make <br/>\n&gt;&gt;a sandwich.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why not just make him a sandwich yourself? Better yet, bring him one before <br/>\nhe knows he&#39;s hungry so it&#39;s just there like manna from heaven. ;-) May help <br/>\navert the headache too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Funny thing is, he _loves_ to cook dinner! Especially with his dad (who&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;&gt;a chef).&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>WOW! That&#39;s great! I&#39;d encourage that interaction and forget about why he <br/>\nwon&#39;t make a simple sandwich. Very cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green <br/>\nearth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly alive.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                      ~ Thich Nhat Hanh<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62137,"nextTopicId":62146}}
