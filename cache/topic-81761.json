What was THAT all about? As <br/>\na <br/>\nchild, I always wondered &quot;What&#39;s the big deal? Why can&#39;t she wear whatever <br/>\ncolor she wants?&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were just too many rules in those days.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own family, when we took my cousins in, there were two girls in (I&#39;ll <br/>\npick a year at random, but the pattern continued) fifth grade, and two in <br/>\nsecond.  Our cousins were older, but having started school in Texas with fall <br/>\nbirthdays, they were a year &quot;behind&quot; New Mexico starting years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if that&#39;s considered in comparing test scores?  The Texas kids were <br/>\non average older in the same grade than the New Mexico kids who started <br/>\n&quot;early.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith a summer birthday I was the same in either state.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my mom would get the same dress in two colors.  We ended up dressed <br/>\nlike friggin&#39; TWINS and weren&#39;t even sisters.   Sadistic or lazy, hard to say.  <br/>\nBoth, to a degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for a while we had &quot;colors,&quot; so that if some plastic toy had been bought, <br/>\npink was my sister&#39;s, blue was Nadine&#39;s, red was Nada&#39;s and green or black <br/>\nwould be mine.  Then we could tell our stuff apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nWELL duh.  I find that even though I can&#39;t tell my boys&#39; stuff apart, THEY <br/>\ncan.  I ask them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom had elaborate schemes to keep us from fighting over things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt Christmas she got us the same things.  Four etch-a-sketches.  Four stuffed <br/>\nmonkeys with bananas.   She would mark them with our colors in a small <br/>\ncorner, or with thread.  Socks were marked with a stitch of &quot;our color.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps like an orphanage, or like we used to have rats, in psych lab, with <br/>\nidentifying stripes on their tales put on with magic marker.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to usher for the Santa Fe opera, as a teen.  We wore expensive, <br/>\naccess-controlled long hand-woven ponchos from Ortega&#39;s in Chimayo.   Most were <br/>\nstriped in browns and oranges, but a very few were blue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe blue ones were pretty, but every single night, someone who had chosen <br/>\nblue ended up with the least attractive leftover brown because of this:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe organizer&#39;s daughter had red, strawberry blond hair, and she and her <br/>\nmother said it ONLY looked good with the blue, so every week as the rest of us <br/>\nrushed for the prettiest colors, Karen yawned and hung out by the door, sauntered <br/>\nover and claimed the blue one she wanted when she felt like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I DO understand the ribbon colors thing, from personal experience, two <br/>\nways.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they had the same color ribbons, the mom might have had to settle fights <br/>\nabout whose were whose.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOh!!!  And it&#39;s worse.  There were traditional &quot;rules&quot; about what color <br/>\n&quot;clashed&quot; with another.  My mom refused us wearing green and blue together &quot;because <br/>\nthey clash.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo consideration of how those particular two particular shades looked <br/>\ntogether, just &quot;take it off, it clashes.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSame with pink and red.  &quot;They clash.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom wasn&#39;t an artist at all.  She just feared to break any of the <br/>\nnear-magic-powered mysterious unfounded &quot;rules&quot; which had crept up inside her from <br/>\nevery direction.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo fish with milk.  You might die.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81747,"nextTopicId":81772}}
