Maybe their parents <br/>\nmade sex seem unnatural, not a normal function, not a necessary and important <br/>\nfunction for health.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I think there are the parents who try and scare the <br/>\ncrap out of the kids and then the other ones who just say this is what it is <br/>\nphysically and don&#39;t worry about the whole responsibility part of it both <br/>\nphysically and emotionally.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t see ANYONE recommending that latter part of that.  Not anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been open with my kids about sex AND because I have teenaged boys, about <br/>\nhow sometimes it is used to entrap boys into arrangements they&#39;re not really <br/>\nold enough to understand.  I&#39;ve shown them two (pointed out to them, not <br/>\nprocured for them) examples of females anxious to marry, who would be willing <br/>\nto do or say just about anything to get one of my boys or one of their <br/>\nfriends into a relationship that could lead to marriage and QUICK.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne, I&#39;ve lost track of.  When this batch of boys didn&#39;t pan out for her, she <br/>\nwent hunting elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne came from out of state, bought four of the boys here gifts (spent over <br/>\n$250 easily on these gifts), hung out with them.  I never met her.  I thought <br/>\nabout pressing that, but decided to warn and get the gossip instead.   What I <br/>\nknew before she came to visit was she was in her mid 20&#39;s and had a severely <br/>\ndisabled child.  Diapers at 12, not walking, some neurological thing which <br/>\nleaves her as helpless as an infant.    They met through online gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found out two days ago that a friend&#39;s unschooled only son met and has <br/>\nalready MARRIED a woman he met online.  She moved to Canada from Hong Kong.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s about ten years older.  I think he&#39;s 17.   The parents actually really <br/>\nlike her and seem to think it&#39;s a viable situation.  Partly because the <br/>\nparents are themselves of a similar age difference and the mother is from a <br/>\nwholly different country (one of the Eastern European nations).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo with all that, what I&#39;m trying to say is that the technicalities of sexual <br/>\nrelations themselves might not be as important to know as the surrounding <br/>\nrealities.  Before having teenaged boys I had an entirely &quot;girl-centric&quot; view <br/>\nof the dangers of teenaged hormone storms.  I knew which boys were dangerous <br/>\nand didn&#39;t much think girls could be dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile &quot;just right&quot; is everyone&#39;s goal, I&#39;d rather my kids had too much <br/>\nknowledge than too little, about things as important as this.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] sex questions, was Kids and movies and books","postDate":"1035845141","msgId":48560,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMjJna0Y3YlBmYTVjUGdqaUcwMDAxNGEzMEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":48559,"nextInTopic":48569,"prevInTime":48559,"nextInTime":48561,"topicId":48376,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I talked about what my five year old watched, etc.   Dylan<br/>\nwas actually a little older when he saw the sex scene, maybe a year<br/>\nolder.<br/>\nThe first talk about sex came early for him, I think because we had two<br/>\nfriends who were pregnant and there was much baby talk going on.  He<br/>\nasked the inevitable - what&#39;s the baby doing in there... how&#39;d it get in<br/>\nthere... How&#39;s it getting out...and I started with simple answers<br/>\nthinking he didn&#39;t want or need more than that.  But he kept asking, not<br/>\nsatisfied until it was making perfectly clear sense to him.  <br/>\nThere wasn&#39;t just one sex talk.  There were many, and sometimes he comes<br/>\nup to one of us now and asks one question, kind of out of the blue, and<br/>\nwe answer. I don&#39;t assume he wants to know everything, I just answer what<br/>\nhe specifically asks.  If he wants more information he lets me know.   If<br/>\nhe hears something from one of his friends he checks it against what we<br/>\nsay.   One thing I noticed about ps kids is they have the idea sex is<br/>\nnasty.  Dylan thinks of sex more like eating or sleeping or pooping, just<br/>\none more thing everybody does.   He can&#39;t really imagine he&#39;ll ever be<br/>\ninterested even thought we&#39;ve talked about body chemicals, etc.  But he&#39;s<br/>\nok with things so far, and not afraid or embarrassed to ask questions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSex talk has to include the emotional side of things.  We have talked<br/>\nabout this some, how people might confuse sex with fondness or love, how<br/>\npeople with emotional problems can be confused by their feelings about<br/>\nsex, etc.   But the talking doesn&#39;t happen all at once.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] sex questions, was Kids and movies and books","postDate":"1035751862","msgId":48419,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMTFIZUZYdmpRTjBoSVFGQlIwMDAwYmJmMUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":48389,"nextInTopic":48525,"prevInTime":48418,"nextInTime":48420,"topicId":48376,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
