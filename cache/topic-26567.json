Get rid of<br/>\nthe dirt area and get a covered sandbox, try some of the &quot;off&quot; type spray<br/>\nyou can get at the pet supply stores (which never impressed the strays in<br/>\nour neighborhood, but maybe impresses some). I have also *heard* of a sort<br/>\nof automatic sprinkler system that is a motion detector (the water goes off<br/>\nfor just a minute or so), but have never met one personally, which would<br/>\nwork great.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not a fan of stray cats, who can carry disease, including rabies. Live<br/>\nanimal traps are available for borrowing at some humane societies, and you<br/>\ncan then turn in trap-and-cat and check out another one and repeat the<br/>\nprocess until they&#39;re gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26554,"nextTopicId":26581}}
