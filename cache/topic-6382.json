It is put out by SCHOLASTIC.  This<br/>\nmorning we were rolling on the ground laughing as we read the part about the<br/>\nprofessor with the silly name making everyone else change their names... Of<br/>\ncourse we had to see what our names would become.... we were the<br/>\n&quot;Waffleshorts&quot; Family and my kids were Poopsie and Gidget!
