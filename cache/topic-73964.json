It is very common for <br/>\nhunters to beat thier dogs with  dead rabbits, squirrels  or coons to &quot;train&quot; <br/>\nthem to hunt.  Dogs are staked out, yes,so they won&#39;t run away or get run <br/>\nover. But, they are also never let off to exercise except when it&#39;s huntin time.  <br/>\nThey live in thier own feces, sometimes with no shade.

Forgive me.. its just that they <br/>\n  are a very central part of our lives right now and we have spent so much time <br/>\n  and energy with them..  It has been such a learning experience for the kids.. <br/>\n  and for me too, sort of a recalling of just how wonderful babies and mommies <br/>\n  are and life in general .  The growing up phases, the puppies mirror children <br/>\n  with each phase of infant, toddler, preschool, ( ok, preschool may not be a <br/>\n  correct term for an unschooling group.. lol.. say 3-5 yos)  then  adolescence, <br/>\n  even teens.  Of course it all happens in a matter of weeks and months rather than <br/>\n  years for humans, but its so great to observe the progress of life.  That is <br/>\n  one reason we have taken pictures every week, just to compare how much they <br/>\n  have grown and changed.      OK. I had a main story to tell, sorry I got off <br/>\n  rambling..<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yesterday Landon took Joy to work with him on the farm.   It was the first <br/>\n  extended time the puppies have had away from their Moma.   They were all fine, <br/>\n  they didnt really even act like they knew she was gone. After all, they have <br/>\n  plenty of sibs to keep them company.  When I brought Landon home, the puppies <br/>\n  were lined up along the walk watching the van intently.  You could see the <br/>\n  tentative looks in thier eyes.. Thier ears perked up, thier tails barely wagging.. <br/>\n  They were watching so closely to make sure they knew the folks who got out of <br/>\n  the van.   I opened the door and they  got that OH YAYYY, its you look on <br/>\n  thier face and started to trot towards me.  Then, Landon let Joy out of the van <br/>\n  and she ran around the front.  As soon as the puppies saw her, they broke into a <br/>\n  full on run towards her.. with thier little bodies just shaking with <br/>\n  excitement.   They literally attacked her jumping on her, licking her, welcoming her <br/>\n  home.   I swear, I think they had forgotten about her til they saw her.. LOL.  <br/>\n  But it was sooo cute to see them so happy to see thier moma.   She even laid <br/>\n  down and let them nurse a while.   It was such a wonderful sight to see the <br/>\n  puppies greeting their moma  with such enthusiasm and excitement.  It was so much <br/>\n  just like a child  running to his moma after being seperated from her for a <br/>\n  while.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Teresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Folks ( yes, MORE than one person) call and <br/>\nask &quot;Does the car run good? can I drive it home?  DUH!!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving to be home at appointed times for folks to NOT show up. You go through <br/>\nseveral calls, mostly duds, then someone does actually want to come over.  <br/>\nYou spend time giving directions, setting up an appointment.   Stay at home and <br/>\nwait... and wait.  And, they never show up. UGHGHGG.  Its usually always on a <br/>\nweekend too.   This has happened more times than I can count.  Also, going to <br/>\nmeet folks and they don&#39;t show up.  OR driving an hour to meet them and THEN <br/>\nthey figure out &quot;its not what they wanted&quot;  DH did this with a bike that he had <br/>\nclearly described every detail to the guy.   That took out about 4 hours of <br/>\ntime he could have been doing something &quot;good&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Shady characters&quot; showing up and basically casing the joint to see if there <br/>\nis anything they can come back for<br/>\n<br/>\nOne guy came to look at a car we had for sell.  He walked all around our <br/>\nhouse.. Asked to go in the basement ( DH declined).  He went in our garage to look <br/>\nat a car that was NOT for sell.   He was just &quot;weird&quot;   DH said he got a bad <br/>\nfeeling about him.  Might be a coincidence, but that night, the dogs went wild <br/>\nbarking.. obvious warning barks... DH got up to see what the commotion was, <br/>\nand he saw someone run across the yard to a car parked in the lot of the store <br/>\nnext to us- CREEPY!<br/>\n<br/>\nFolks being offended if I ask too many questions.  If folks are giving you <br/>\nmoney for something, they usually feel like its none of your business what they <br/>\nare going to do with the &quot;thing&quot;   Keep in mind, we live in RURAL NC.   :-)  <br/>\n.. &quot;Well, hell, you want $50 for this pup, what  do you cire what I do with it, <br/>\nyou got your money.. I&#39;m agonna make hit into me a huntin dog, and if he does <br/>\ngood, I got me a few bitches I might stand him to&quot;  .. OK.. so I don;t sell <br/>\nhim the dog.. I saved the pup, but I also wasted a lot of my time and pissed <br/>\noff some redneck hunter.<br/>\n<br/>\nFolks who do not speak english that I couldn&#39;t communicate with anyway,so why <br/>\ntry to &quot;screen&quot; them<br/>\n<br/>\n(example- someone calls-  spanish, spanish, spanish, spanish, Car?... you may <br/>\neven get enough basic communication to make an appointment.. then when they <br/>\nget there.. spanish spanish spanish spanish How much?.. and we never actually <br/>\nsold the car to a non-english speaking person.  Don&#39;t ask me why, I don&#39;t speak <br/>\nspanish)<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone who has been &quot;invited&quot; on to my property &quot;getting hurt&quot; and suing me <br/>\n( a common scam)<br/>\n<br/>\n(example- Guy comes over to look at our station wagon we had for sell. ( TRUE <br/>\nSTORY).   The car burns oil, smokes ( as stated in the ad)  He decides he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want it. .Comes back 3 days later and tells me he had to go to the <br/>\nhospital for an asthma attack because of the smoke from the car when he cranked it <br/>\nup!!  It didnt even smoke when he cranked it up!!.  He hustled me for money to <br/>\npay for his ER visit..  Threatened suing.. I didn&#39;t buy it though, and refused <br/>\nto give him $$..  He was just hustling me, but still, NOT  a pleasant <br/>\nexperience)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoy and Skippy ( our other dog) freaking out when strangers come on our <br/>\nproperty ( esp now that Joy is a protective Moma)<br/>\n<br/>\n(One man came to look at a bike that Skippy did NOT like.. I don&#39;t know why, <br/>\nhe has never bitten anyone.. and he didnt bite this man either.. but he sure <br/>\nacted like he was going to  He did the &quot;bark and hold&quot; routine.. wouldnt let <br/>\nthe man take a step.  We couldnt even pick Skippy up he was so riled up.  The <br/>\nguy just left.. Even when the mailman comes to deliver a package, they act like <br/>\nthey are going to tear them up)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that meeting someone for a short visit and asking them a few <br/>\nquestions will not gaurantee they will give the puppy a good home.   There is no way <br/>\nI can really ascertain what kind of people some are just by taking thier money <br/>\nand asking them a few questions.

I am going to go in on the coat tails of <br/>\nthe rescue group I know..   How I see it is this, these folks get puppies <br/>\n&quot;dumped&quot; on them all the time.  They foot the bill for rescued animals vaccinations <br/>\nand sterilzation.  What I will do is just ask them if I can bring my puppies <br/>\nalong with thier rescued dogs and dopt them out &quot;through&quot; them, and they keep <br/>\nthe fees.  I will do all the &quot;work&quot;, and the puppies will not have to be <br/>\nfostered if they do not find homes.   Also, puppies are a good attraction to get <br/>\nfolks over to see the dogs up for adoption.  Folks may come over to see the <br/>\npuppies, then end up finding an adult dog that suits them better.  So, its a win <br/>\nwin situation.  ( in my opinion)  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Actually, I am going to exhaust all of my other options before I contact <br/>\nthe rescue group.   Family, friends, word of mouth, that sort of thing among <br/>\nfolks I already know..

They do have a <br/>\nscreening process,and require puppies to be spayed or neutered ( they give a coupon <br/>\nfor puppies that are too young to be sterilized.. puppies over 4 months are <br/>\nalready sterilized)    The adoption fee is $60, so, not a small chunk of change.  <br/>\nOur puppies will be vaccinated and wormed, with vet records.  And the rescue <br/>\norganization would keep the adoption fees.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not a breeder.  I am an irresponsible dog owner who neglected to get our <br/>\ndog spayed before she got pregnant.

I&#39;ve had crazy Weimaraners for years (about 18 <br/>\nyears, I think). Then a viszla (that I absolutely adored) and a pointer. When <br/>\nthey were stolen, I went off the deep end. When I was able to get another <br/>\ndog, I got a rescue GSD. Then I went out to get a basenji or a French bulldog. I <br/>\ncame home with a beagle &#39;cause Cameron LOVES them. As much as I&#39;d like a <br/>\nFrenchie or a basenji (Deb&#39;s cracking up, I know!) or maybe a Scottish deerhound or <br/>\na standard schnauzer, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m hooked on this little beagle! &lt;g&gt;  He&#39;s <br/>\njust too damned cute! I want a six pack! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know full-well that they aren&#39;t for everybody! But no breed is. You <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t pay me to take a lab or golden. But he&#39;s so funny and easy.

He probably drove them crazy! &lt;g&gt; But I could look at and play with <br/>\nhim all day! &lt;G&gt; I would NOT have a field beagle though---I KNOW they&#39;re <br/>\nNUTS!<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy YOUR little Kelly!
