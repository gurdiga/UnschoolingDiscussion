If you are a family where mom cooks <br/>\neverynight and everyone sits down to dinner, I think the kids should <br/>\nat least try the foods offered.  Now that mine are older, if I serve <br/>\nsomething they don&#39;t like, they make something else and it&#39;s no big <br/>\ndeal.  I&#39;ve never restricted ice cream, candy, pastry, etc.  All three <br/>\nof mine have pretty good eating habits now.  They all eat salad.  <br/>\nRachel is the only one who does not like vegetables but even she eats <br/>\na few of them.  None of them gorge on bad foods with one exception.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat exception has to do with allergies/sensitivities.  Our old <br/>\nallergist, when I first went to him before we had any idea the kids <br/>\nhad allergies (actually before two of them even existed) - - he told <br/>\nme that often one will crave that which one is allergic to in the way <br/>\nan alcoholic craves alcohol.  He was absolutely right in my case.  I <br/>\nwas craving corn in a BIG way.  Once I got it out of my diet, and it <br/>\nwas very difficult to do so, I stopped craving it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when Jenni at three was drinking a gallon of milk a day by herself, <br/>\nand having lots of allergy symptoms, milk was the first elimination <br/>\nand challenge we tried and that was her problem.  And I recently <br/>\nexplained what we had to dfo with Rachel regarding her allergies.  <br/>\nWhile I think kids should have control over their diets, I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nI can say it is an absolute.  I think there are times when a parent <br/>\nneeds to step in to help with a problem.  BUT - the parent should do <br/>\nso withthe this thought in mind - the goal is not to control the <br/>\nallergy for the child.  The goal is to help the child learn to control <br/>\nit by himself.  There are as many ways to get to that point as there <br/>\nare children.  In Jenni&#39;s case, just eliminating milk for a week and <br/>\nthen doing the challenge and explaining the problem to her was enough <br/>\nat 3 and she has not needed my help since.  With Rachel, it rocked <br/>\nback and forth several times and it looks like Wyndham will be more <br/>\nlike Rachel than Jenni.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect there are others who have different examples of when a <br/>\nparent should maybe do a little more about diet than most.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1123183,"authorName":"dacunefare@aol.com","from":"dacunefare@...","profile":"undermom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: ice cream for breakfast was: TCS :-P","postDate":"1020145295","msgId":36514,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQzLmFjYjQ0ZDYuMjlmZjg4OGZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":36491,"nextInTopic":36530,"prevInTime":36513,"nextInTime":36515,"topicId":36424,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Um.

And, if it is not right for me, I <br/>\nreject it.  For me.  Inasmuch as TCS has to do with a parent&#39;s choice of <br/>\nparenting styles, this decision is one that I, as a parent must make.  I <br/>\nchoose against TCS.  And, if I were 3, I am sure that the TCS people would <br/>\napplaud me for that decision.  However, carrying the baggage of 31 years, <br/>\nplus 3, I understand that I may be criticized roundly and soundly for my <br/>\ndecision to reject the TCS induction (for lack of a better word), and to <br/>\nchoose my own unique and, so far as I know, unlabelled parenting style of <br/>\n&quot;Roll with the punches, and learn as ya&#39; go.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat works for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you might be open-minded enough to consider it for yourself?
