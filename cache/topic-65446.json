I guess really I just feel sad for her. We present a large number of social opportunities and have offered lots of activity choice. Nothing seems to have clicked for her and she is lonely ad feeling very outcast.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo! Groups Sponsor <br/>\n       <br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

She loved the dog, took it to the park all the time, etc. She got very interested in obedience training, making natural dog food and all sorts of stuff. She even did some breeding. Most of the people she met were adults, so it didn&#39;t really get her any friends her age, but it did help her be more sure of herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I&#39;m new here, coming out of lurkdom after a couple of weeks of reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nKay, the dog lover<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] question about social help","postDate":"1050762037","msgId":65457,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFQTE1QjM2LjcxNURFREQwQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDAwNjkwMWMzMDYzMyQzMjZjZGQ4MCQxODU1NDUxOEBjYS5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":65446,"nextInTopic":65458,"prevInTime":65456,"nextInTime":65458,"topicId":65446,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**I have a daughter who is 12.

Always has had this trouble. She seems to find socialising awkward. We have discussed it and she just does not know how to mingle and interact. She is awkward physically and is big for her age.Appears to have thyroid difficulties that we are just becoming aware of. She also has had anxiety attacks and generally has a low anxiety always.<br/>\nThe question is this. She is lonely. She wants a good friend. Had one but it fell apart as she handled some emotional differences inappropriately. I listen and support her and now we are in special Olympics rhythmic gymnastics.She appears to like this although claims she is not handicapped.In this group she is not the last or clumsiest for the first time. By being in this group are we telling her there is something wrong with her and is there any more I can do to help with the social frustration. We were at a movie and I saw her looking at two girls walking and chatting together. When I asked her what she thought when she saw this she said she wanted a friend to do that with. I quetioned whether she thought she might have more luck socially in school. She said maybe but she was not willing to go that route. She recognised that they would tease her for her size, red hair and slowness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realise I cannot control or make her pain go away. This is hard to see and I wonder if I am depriving her socially somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nTim and Maureen Thomas<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stillwaters.ca\">http://www.stillwaters.ca</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65522,"nextTopicId":65509}}
