It is not<br/>\nexhaustive nor is it full proof. However, so many of these work that I<br/>\nthought I&#39;d throw them out here. (We began years ago by making a list<br/>\nthat we posted to the refrigerator that could be referenced when<br/>\nsomeone got bored. Just having this list posted saved a lot of<br/>\ncloudy-eyed wandering through the house...) This list applies to all<br/>\nthe ages of our kids ranging between 7-17. We have five children.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Find a sibling and play a board game (list of games we own)<br/>\n2. Jump on the trampoline<br/>\n3. Kick the soccer ball<br/>\n4. Make a tent out of sheets in the living room and eat snacks under it<br/>\n5. Call a friend on the phone to chat or to come play<br/>\n6. Dress up and pretend<br/>\n7. Play drama games (we have a book of these and we are theater hounds)<br/>\n8. Make tea and muffins, invite others to join you. Set table and light<br/>\ncandles.<br/>\n9. Cut flowers, make a bouquet<br/>\n10. Bake clay creations using sculpey clay (I try to buy a fresh set of<br/>\ncolors every few months)<br/>\n11. Use mom&#39;s binoculars to watch birds.<br/>\n12. Cut paper and glue it.<br/>\n13. Use the Prismacolors to draw (refer to &quot;how to draw&quot; books on book<br/>\nshelves)<br/>\n14. Draw with sidewalk chalk<br/>\n15. Play in the creek<br/>\n16. Play the piano or saxophone or guitar<br/>\n17. Go online and play a game on the Internet, or X Box Live<br/>\n18. Pop popcorn; watch a movie<br/>\n19. Start a fire (winter, in the fireplace. Summer; in the outdoor<br/>\nfireplace) roast hotdogs or marshmellows.<br/>\n20. Make popsicles.<br/>\n21. Read a book<br/>\n22. Memorize a poem<br/>\n23. Write a poem<br/>\n24. Choreograph a dance in the living room<br/>\n25. Write on your bedroom walls things you want to remember - song<br/>\nlyrics, friend&#39;s names, funny jokes<br/>\n26. Keep a scrapbook<br/>\n27. Take some pictures<br/>\n28. Make origami<br/>\n29. Make and hang Chinese lanterns from a string across the kitchen<br/>\n30. Play croquet or badminton<br/>\n31. Bake cookies<br/>\n32. Write a letter or email<br/>\n33. Have a water fight<br/>\n34. Rearrange your bedroom furniture<br/>\n35. Plant seeds or flowers<br/>\n36. Write your own myth or legend after reading the Greek myths<br/>\n37. Clean out your wardrobe to make space for new clothes<br/>\n38. Sit in a tree and whistle<br/>\n39. Take a walk with a bottle of water<br/>\n40. Create a cozy hiding place (blankets, pillow) and bring your<br/>\nheadphones/CD player to it. Sit quietly reading or listening or<br/>\nsnoozing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat should be enough to get anyone started. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\nYahoo!
