We have two vehicles, and dh does things after he works, but during the day, we&#39;re on our own. I work from home full-time, so it does get hectic. I don&#39;t like being stuck to a clock much, though there are days where I feel I do nothing but check the time. Between meetings, projects at work, activities I take the kids to, well-baby checkups, etc., the scheduling can get really hectic. There are days where I feel like I&#39;ve not done much other than keep the house relatively okay and changed diapers, but then we talk about the day, and they amaze me at what they&#39;ve learned throughout it all. I think they have to learn that life doesn&#39;t work around us, so maybe it&#39;s a good thing they understand it already. Having a big family, they best learn it now ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: rumpleteasermom <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, December 06, 2001 7:11 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Balancing Unschooling and Public Schooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  So . . . does anyone else have any insight in how to deal with this <br/>\n  issue?
