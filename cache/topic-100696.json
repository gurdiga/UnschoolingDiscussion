We went back and forth on whether to get an older dog (we knew we <br/>\nwanted to rescue rather than go to a breeder) or put the work in with a <br/>\npuppy. I finally decided that with young kids (and many rescues won&#39;t <br/>\nplace with young children) that I felt more comfortable with a puppy <br/>\nwhose buttons we would be installing ;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI researched and decided I wanted something Springer Spaniel-ish, and <br/>\nended up finding the puppies on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.petfinder.com\">http://www.petfinder.com</a> . There was a <br/>\nlitter of Springer/ Lab puppies with A Forever Home Rescue in Virginia. <br/>\nWe ended up driving more than an hour there, twice, to get our puppy, <br/>\nand she has been wonderful!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was only 7 weeks old when we got her, and my kids were 6, 4 and 3. <br/>\nShe and Sam, my youngest and the biggest reason we got her, are amazing <br/>\ntogether. You can see a picture of him in his wolf costume wrestling <br/>\nwith her at my blog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com\">http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com</a> .<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a lot of work, and the biggest thing I worried about was <br/>\nestablishing her order in our pack since my kids are so little. I didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant her to think she was stronger or higher up than they are, so we did <br/>\na lot of work on that front in addition to basic training. I poke and <br/>\nprod her, tug her ears and her tail, periodically so that if the kids do <br/>\nthis, she&#39;s used to it. I make sure that the kids can take her bones and <br/>\ntoys every once in a while. They began feeding her by hand out of her <br/>\ndog bowl when she was a puppy, so she&#39;s used to them coming near her <br/>\nfood while she&#39;s eating. Lots of stuff like that. She still mouths the <br/>\nkids when they&#39;re playing, but she&#39;s never once clamped down. She&#39;s more <br/>\nlikely to hurt them with her nails than anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t suggest a small breed, personally, with small children as <br/>\nthey tend to be nippier and more delicate. I wanted something big enough <br/>\nto hold up to my rough and tumble kids. Our puppy is 1.5 now, and she <br/>\nweighs about 65 lbs. She&#39;s taken the kids out a couple of times by <br/>\nbarreling through a door, so I do have to be careful about that and on <br/>\nthe stairs--a definite drawback. But,  Sam will get her head in a <br/>\nhalf-nelson-like grip and take her down like he&#39;s in a rodeo! *lol* She <br/>\neven sleeps on the bottom of his bed now. They are great together!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that&#39;s helpful info, Laura. FWIW, I do think you made the right <br/>\ndecision in the end by placing her with a family better-suited to her needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"(sorry for blank) re: going against a child&#39;s wishes","postDate":"1098192170","msgId":100696,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1Yy40MTg1ZDAxNy4yZWE2NmYyYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":100697,"prevInTime":100695,"nextInTime":100697,"topicId":100696,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/18/04 10:38:12 PM, lauraj2@verizon.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1948168973\">In a message dated 10/18/04 10:38:12 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lauraj2@...\">lauraj2@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Ben can visit anytime, he and dh go over there often.
