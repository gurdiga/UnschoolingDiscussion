At one time<br/>\nthey were just two terms for the same thing, so the question was like asking<br/>\nwhat the difference is between a car and an automobile. Today, homeschooling<br/>\nhas remained a generic term while unschooling has come to refer to a<br/>\nspecific type of homeschooling. So now the question is like asking what the<br/>\ndifference is between a Ferrari and a car. Just what is it about unschooling<br/>\nthat differentiates it from other types of homeschooling enough to warrant<br/>\nits own term?<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore we look at that question, let&#39;s look at a history of the words. At<br/>\none time, there was no special term for people who took their children out<br/>\nof the public school system to teach them at home. If you look at references<br/>\nto education before there even was a public school system, you will see<br/>\nphrases such as &quot;tutored at home,&quot; &quot;self-taught,&quot; or &quot;no formal education&quot;<br/>\nto refer to people we might now call homeschooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven after the modern homeschooling movement got started, there wasn&#39;t a<br/>\nstandard term for what these parents were doing. People simply referred to<br/>\nteaching their children at home, or not sending them to school. In issue<br/>\n#108 of Growing Without Schooling, Susannah Sheffer tells us that the first<br/>\nissue of GWS (published in 1977), did not even make use of the term<br/>\nhomeschooling. In issue #2, John Holt used the term unschooling, but it was<br/>\nused as a general term for what we now call homeschooling. In issue #118 of<br/>\nGWS, Aaron Falbel tells us that Holt wrote in issue #2 of GWS (Nov. 1977)<br/>\nthat they [GWS] would use unschooling &quot;when we mean taking kids out of<br/>\nschool.&quot; Falbel goes on to say that it wasn&#39;t until the early 1980&#39;s that<br/>\nthe term homeschooling became more popular.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know when it happened or who first used the phrase, but it is pretty<br/>\neasy to see that if most kids went to public school, then people might say<br/>\nkids who were taught at home went to &quot;home school.&quot; As the term has become<br/>\nmore an accepted part of our vocabulary, it has moved from the novelty<br/>\nphrase &quot;home schooling&quot; (in quotes) to home schooling (no quotes), to<br/>\nhome-schooling (hyphenated), and now homeschooling (one word).<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt is considered the father of unschooling and the person who coined<br/>\nthe term. In Holt&#39;s early writings, he seemed to hold out hope that the<br/>\nschool system could be fixed, but he later became more convinced that<br/>\nparents were better off taking their kids out of schools. I imagine that it<br/>\nthen seemed natural to him to refer to the process of not sending your kids<br/>\nto school as unschooling, as in not schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the terms may have been interchangeable originally, that is no longer<br/>\nthe case today. Unschooling has become associated with the particular style<br/>\nof homeschooling in which no set curriculum is used. Where the split<br/>\noriginated is hard to say, but part of the reason for the division is<br/>\nprobably because of the words themselves. Homeschooling carries an<br/>\nimplication of schooling-at-home, while unschooling connotes that what you<br/>\nare doing is the opposite of school. People who accepted the teaching<br/>\ntechniques of school but wanted more control over the subject matter,<br/>\nsocialization, or morals that their children were exposed to might readily<br/>\naccept the term homeschooling. People who disliked the teaching techniques<br/>\nand environment of school might be more inclined to use the term<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, homeschooling is considered to span a spectrum from those who<br/>\nschool-at-home to those who unschool. The school-at home designation is<br/>\nself-explanatory. This group revels in all the trappings of school! They may<br/>\nhave the same desks used in the public schools, some of the same text books,<br/>\nand they may even start each day by ringing a bell and saying the pledge of<br/>\nallegiance. The parent assumes the role of teacher, preparing lesson plans,<br/>\nassigning homework or tests, and grading papers. Their &quot;holy grail&quot; is the<br/>\nsearch for the perfect curriculum, the one that will cover everything their<br/>\nchildren need to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is it that unschoolers do? Where do you find a curriculum package that<br/>\nwill help you to be an unschooler? The reason that unschooling is hard to<br/>\nexplain and hard for some people to understand, is that it is not a<br/>\ntechnique that can be broken down to a step by step process. Rather,<br/>\nunschooling is an attitude, a way of life. Where most homeschooling puts the<br/>\nemphasis on what needs to be learned, unschooling puts the emphasis on who<br/>\nis doing the learning. This makes it a very personalized experience and one<br/>\nthat does not lend itself well to the one size-fits-all approach of a<br/>\ncommercial curriculum package.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are some of the unintended lessons of a &quot;school&quot; approach to learning?<br/>\nFirst of all, the student is taught that learning is something that takes<br/>\nplace in a certain location at certain times. From 8 to 3 you do lessons at<br/>\nyour desk. Learning is also unpleasant and often boring, so it is usually a<br/>\nrelief when &quot;school&quot; is finally out. Students become used to the idea that<br/>\nlearning requires a teacher - someone more knowledgeable than them. This<br/>\nfollows the old model of learning in which students are empty cups waiting<br/>\nto be filled and the teacher is the pitcher full of knowledge that will fill<br/>\nthem. This also emphasizes the idea that students must be taught - in other<br/>\nwords, what happens to you (learning) is the result of what someone else<br/>\ndoes to you (teaching). School also reinforces the idea that learning is a<br/>\nlinear process. You work and add knowledge incrementally over time in a<br/>\nsteady process. To get from point A to point C, you must first pass point B.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn unschooling, learning can happen anywhere and at anytime. It is an<br/>\nongoing, natural process - part of the journey we call life. It is not<br/>\nunpleasant or boring anymore than breathing, eating or sleeping are. There<br/>\nis no sense of relief that school is out because learning is always<br/>\nhappening. Students also know that they are responsible for their learning.<br/>\nThey do not need an &quot;expert&quot; to teach them. If they have an interest, they<br/>\ncan go out and pursue the knowledge they need. This is another fundamental<br/>\ndifference between a schoolish approach and an unschooling model. School is<br/>\na case of knowledge (that someone else has determined to be important) in<br/>\npursuit of the student, while unschooling puts the student in pursuit of the<br/>\nknowledge (which they have decided is important). In this role, parents are<br/>\nnot teachers who always know more than their children, they are often fellow<br/>\nlearners making the journey along with their children. (See the side bar for<br/>\nmore comments about the non-linear learning of unschooling.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is unfortunate that the older term &quot;unschooled&quot; often means uneducated.<br/>\nAs unschooling gains acceptance and its effectiveness is recognized, the<br/>\ndictionaries will have to be corrected to reflect the positive aspects of<br/>\nsomeone who has been educated by unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Nanci and Thomas Kuykendall [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tn-k4of5@...\">tn-k4of5@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, July 20, 2000 1:37 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re:[Unschooling-dotcom] Define Unschooling<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been asked to write an article defining Unschooling<br/>\n&gt; (at least from what I know.)
