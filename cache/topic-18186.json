I want to say that I didn&#39;t agree with the statement that seemed <br/>\nlike a personal attack on you, Sandra, because I have always found that is <br/>\nhow respectful debates over issues turn into angry arguments with little <br/>\npositive coming out of them.  <br/>\n     I missed some of the posts because I had been leary of opening the <br/>\nemails that showed as some kind of attachments on my computer but there are <br/>\nso many of them on this list now that I finally just started opening them <br/>\nyesterday.  I didn&#39;t know if this would make me more likely to pick up a <br/>\nvirus because AOL always posts a warning before I open them.<br/>\n     Anyway, I was just thinking about something this morning relating to <br/>\nwhat you just said.  My sister just had twins, a boy and a girl, in January <br/>\nand was telling me that she doesn&#39;t know if she&#39;ll homeschool, that it <br/>\ndepends upon whether the schools really make her mad.  So I was thinking, <br/>\nrealizing that I no longer homeschool because the public schools were such a <br/>\ndisallusionment to me.  That is definitely what initially brought me this <br/>\ndirection but I now homeschool/unschool because I can&#39;t imagine us living any <br/>\nother way.  This just feels so normal to me and my family.  I unschool <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s wonderful and not because the schools aren&#39;t.  This may not seem <br/>\nlike an important distinction but it is a different feeling within me.  It <br/>\nused to be that if friends asked why we homeschool, I would explain why I was <br/>\ndown on the schools and didn&#39;t want my kids there.  Now, the first thing that <br/>\nwould come to my head, I think, is that it enables us to live in a way that <br/>\nwe really enjoy, lets the kids grow and learn in such healthy ways, etc.<br/>\n     I think for those that come out of the school systems, this is something <br/>\nthat takes time because for a while, you are pretty focused on what was wrong <br/>\nwith those systems and the bad experiences your kids had there.  Also, my <br/>\nparents both work for public schools so I am still sometimes reeling from <br/>\nthings they tell me that go on there.  But there is something more positive <br/>\nand peaceful about coming TO something, rather than running FROM something.<br/>\n<br/>\n       Lucy in Calif.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18165,"nextTopicId":18096}}
