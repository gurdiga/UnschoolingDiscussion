I am always teasing him, the latest is my Easter card in which he wrote &quot;As tim goes by, I love you more.&quot; The tim is supposed to be time so now everytime I am wondering what time is is I ask him what tim it is:) He laughs about it and it has been a running joke but thank God for spell check he often doesn&#39;t need it anyway. DD #1 doesn&#39;t really need it too much either. I think I read in some of my graduate work that spelling is one of those things that you either are good at or not. Gary (dh) is definitely not, but he sure can do a lot of other things great!
