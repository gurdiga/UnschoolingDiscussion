But all <br/>\nkids have traits that are challenging. Imagine (I&#39;m sure it is difficult &lt;G&gt;) <br/>\nhaving an overly passive child who doesn&#39;t have much energy, for example. <br/>\nImagine ME - social butterfly that I am - having a child who craves solitude <br/>\nand only wants a friend or two - not a group person. Imagine unschooling kids <br/>\nwho don&#39;t communicate well. Imagine kids who are explosive - who get really <br/>\nangry easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of these are challenges - personality traits that make parenting more <br/>\ndifficult than with easy-going kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd kids each have their own individual mix of these traits and they interact <br/>\ndifferently with each different member of the family and differently in <br/>\ndifferent situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they don&#39;t need labels -- they just need to be recognized and handled as <br/>\nyou, the parent, figure out works best for your child. In fact, to label them <br/>\nis to make it seem like the label really TELLS you anything more than what <br/>\nYOU already know, as a parent. Lots of the traits listed for ADD are common <br/>\ntraits in all kids - the ADD lable just means that these traits are so <br/>\npersistent and intense that they always interfere with their functioning in <br/>\nat least a couple of different environments.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut -- the label itself is not going to be relevant at all unless a kid is in <br/>\nschool and needs special services there.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2091","postDate":"1022866930","msgId":37985,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyMi4xMWY1M2I2My4yYTI5MGZmMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37984,"nextInTopic":37989,"prevInTime":37984,"nextInTime":37986,"topicId":37966,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/31/2002 5:14:14 AM Pacific Daylight Time, ... 7 or 8 years ... 3 -- 11, 14, 17 ...
