They all keep each other occupied and <br/>\neach one has interests that the others pick up on also. The two middle ones <br/>\nare almost 7 and just 8 and the baby is 2. The two older ones are great with <br/>\ntheir little sister and she adores them. I find her so much different at <br/>\nthis age then all of my other three were. I know it&#39;s because of the <br/>\ninteraction she has with them and her trying to kep up and do what they do. <br/>\nI&#39;ve been around families with only one or two children and see a definite <br/>\ndifference in how they need to homeschool or unschool. Not a bad thing, just <br/>\ndifferent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.
