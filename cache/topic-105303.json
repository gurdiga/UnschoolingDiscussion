He looked at me rather weird when I mentioned the E word. (that was a joke and a word I don&#39;t use often) Anyway, I explained how me and the kids watched School of Rock and really enjoyed it and then talked about the style of Constantine and Bo on American Idol. We had a nice discusion about rock music because of the movie. My husband said he would have to watch it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen today were able to spend the day at the beach with all 4 kids. Something we don&#39;t do as much as I would like. Tara (19) is kept pretty busy. We had a perfect beach day and the expert sand castle maker (Tara&#39;s own words) helped all 3 of the younger ones build. We searched for shells and rocks and Joseph&#39;s (10) fascination with bottle caps had them finding some ones we never heard of. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater after we are all home and showered, my MIL stops by. Again my husband must of got the lesson question. I walked into the room as he was explaining that yesterdays learning came from rock and roll and today was beers of the world.<br/>\nI somehow don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be asking again anytime soon!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105298,"nextTopicId":105352}}
