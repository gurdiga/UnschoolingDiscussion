It&#39;s a very triggering moment! Brings up a lot of personal pain for me too. <br/>\n<br/>\nI try to remind myself that, just like every child, every adult is doing the best they know how--in that moment with what they are given-- to communicate or meet their needs. Likely they are hurting even more and feeling even less powerless than we are. They are in one of their worst parenting moments (and on some level they likely know it) and don&#39;t know a better way! <br/>\n<br/>\nI think we all know what it&#39;s like to be parenting in ways we really wish we never would. I really don&#39;t believe glaring, shaming or blaming is ever going to help that parent or that child in that situation, or myself for that matter, except for a few moments of release... Isn&#39;t that a little like hitting someone and saying &quot;no hitting&quot;? If we glare or berate, aren&#39;t we just practicing the same &quot;i&#39;m right, you&#39;re wrong/bad&quot; attitude that that parent is transmitting to the child?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I definitely want to step in in some situations! And I do. If I can open my heart enough and it&#39;s not too threatening, I try address the parent compassionately. Just seeing them in this light can shift the whole situation. For example, in a camping situation where an overwhelmed mother had verbally lashed out and was then ignoring her howling child while she was putting up a tent, I asked the mother if I could help her cause it looked like she had a lot to do. She denied my help, but immediately softened, left the tent and went to comfort her child. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother time I stopped a father who was hitting his child in a parking lot by shouting &quot;stop hitting that child!&quot;. Turns out he was a minister and was hitting his child &quot;calmly&quot; and &quot;for his own good&quot;. We had a very long, very cordial conversation in which the little boy peeked out at me from behind his father&#39;s legs, and probably heard for the first time that there was someone who believed that love and hitting never go together, that there were ways that are far more conducive to learning how to manage yourself in life, and that Jesus never advocated hitting children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am too triggered to address the parent, I address the child directly. There are two good articles ont his topic at www.naturalchild.org by Jan Hunt under her child advocacy articles called something like &quot;Intervening for a child in a public place&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nwarmly,<br/>\ningrid<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Re: defending children in public","postDate":"1035497742","msgId":47829,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNjLjI2ODRiMjAzLjJhZTljYjBlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47804,"nextInTopic":47849,"prevInTime":47828,"nextInTime":47830,"topicId":47524,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/23/02 4:30:01 PM, windystreet@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1603331120\">In a message dated 10/23/02 4:30:01 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:windystreet@...\">windystreet@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve stopped people on a few occasions from harming children, including<br/>\none woman who was hitting her child yelling at him &quot;hitting it not ok!&quot;<br/>\nI was flabbergasted and in a split second I realized that I was probably<br/>\nnever going to see these people again  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWouldn&#39;t it have been a great fantasy moment (or might make a good cartoon <br/>\nfor changing people&#39;s lives) if you could turn big like The Incredible Hulk <br/>\nand pick her up and slap her while saying in a big monster voice &quot;Hitting Is <br/>\nNot OKAY!!!!&quot; and she wouldn&#39;t really be hurt (that&#39;s why it needs to be a <br/>\ncartoon) and all the little kids who saw it would laugh merrily and no one <br/>\nwho was there that day would ever hit any child again.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in reality, a little child was being hit by an idiot in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad you said something.

We looked over, saw an (approx.) 2 y/o standing in the seat part of the cart.  So very unsafe.  The mother was turned the other direction, looking at a rack of something or other.  We rushed over and said, &quot;oh sweetie, please sit down so you don&#39;t fall!&quot;  The mother looked at us with almost an evil look and said, &quot;I had her standing there to hold these shirts up to her.  She is fine.&quot;  Whoa!  We thought we were being completely helpful.  Being an x-ray tech, I have seen too many needless fractures in children because the parents were inattentive.  Not to mention sometimes, just plain stupid.  We saw her again later, the child continuing to be a monkey on the cart, balancing precariously, surely to fall any minute.  I don&#39;t know if she ever did injure herself, but it made me very nervous.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat to do then?  She wasn&#39;t &#39;abusing&#39; the child.  Just neglectful or maybe irresponsible.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKimber<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10294444,"authorName":"Myranda","from":"&quot;Myranda&quot; &lt;myrandab@...&gt;","profile":"randascloudream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] defending children in public","postDate":"1035394601","msgId":47527,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzZTcwMWMyN2FiYSRjMTA3OTMwMCQwMTNmZmVhOUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDIzMTcyOTMyLkZGQkkxMDA0Ni5vdXQwMDcudmVyaXpvbi5uZXRAWzEyNy4wLjAuMV0+"},"prevInTopic":47524,"nextInTopic":47547,"prevInTime":47526,"nextInTime":47528,"topicId":47524,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** I know this isn t to me, but it is very possible and DOES happen.
