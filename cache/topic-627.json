You are<br/>\nshown/told how to run a machine and it&#39;s repititious. So to prepare a<br/>\nperson for factory work to me would be to get them used to something not<br/>\nnecessarily stimulating. I never thought of meanness.<br/>\n<br/>\nWE don&#39;t see a lot of imagination coming out of the school educated<br/>\nchildren, nor do we see life skills being very sharp when they graduate.<br/>\nHow many understand the finances behind those credit cards or better yet,<br/>\nhow many leave school with the desire and knowledge to start their own<br/>\nbusinesses?

I do believe that one room schools had one thing going for<br/>\nthem, they could actually say that socialization was a factor as they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t segregate the ages into separate rooms.  But do you actually see<br/>\nthis type of education in the ps system today or even a private one?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Villifying our parents and grandparents isn&#39;t the way to go here.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t villifying my family or the system, simply stating that the model<br/>\nfor todays ps isn&#39;t one which is in place to teach real life skills.

Schools,<br/>\neven when I went which was&#39;t all that ancient, were totally different than<br/>\nthey are today. My sons are constantly telling me how lucky I was to grow<br/>\nup then. But when they bring that up it covers much more than school. They<br/>\nare talking about the economy, societal rules and so on. They don&#39;t see<br/>\npast generations as having been horrible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that finding peace in our families has nothing to do with school<br/>\nor past generations. It simply comes from growing together. And the only<br/>\nway to grow together is to be together. For our family that came about<br/>\nthrough leaving school, not getting ourselves so wrapped up in outside<br/>\nactivities that we don&#39;t have time at home (yes we even make family dates<br/>\nsince the boys are older and have more freedom to make plans with friends.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trouble we see today goes much deeper than schools. Whether we are<br/>\ntalking about the school shootings or the number of children being<br/>\ndiagnosed as ADD to gangs or whatever. The answers aren&#39;t in past<br/>\ngenerations, they are right here. We&#39;ve lost something and unfortunately<br/>\nthe signs are showing up at the schools. I don&#39;t want my children to return<br/>\nto schools simply because I love knowing them again, but I also don&#39;t want<br/>\nto see them finding themselves in any situation which makes them unhappy.<br/>\n<br/>\nLois</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Hsmotgo@xxx.xxx","from":"Hsmotgo@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"TDHXMBqV9FuLhC7gOvqcmYorTfcAoprjI1yjGzF628ww-26kt_GAWA5102Bd1TaAfnatxSra","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Please look again.","postDate":"928683280","msgId":634,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy41OC42MzQuOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":627,"nextInTopic":651,"prevInTime":633,"nextInTime":635,"topicId":627,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/6/99 9:23:00 AM EST, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-77773459\">In a message dated 6/6/99 9:23:00 AM EST, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; If we tell them (and ourselves) that <br/>\n our parents made the best choices available to them given their means and <br/>\n knowledge and beliefs, I think there will be more peace in our families and <br/>\n in our hearts. &gt;&gt;<br/>\nSandra,<br/>\napplause, applause!!
