I can SO relate with the night time thing being a<br/>\nbattle. There have been SO many nights that my husband and I have looked at<br/>\neach other, after trying to get the kids to sleep at some ridiculous time,<br/>\nsay 8:30 or something and just said &quot;what the heck is wrong with us&quot;. It was<br/>\nlike we were putting unnecessary stress on ourselves. In the summer our<br/>\nschedule totally changes. We are usually out in the garden or playing, or<br/>\ndrumming by the fire until at least 9:30.  The nights that we aren&#39;t may be<br/>\none of those nights that the kids go to bed early. When I say that a regimen<br/>\nin the evening can be important, I am not talking about every single night.<br/>\nI used to obsess like that, but not anymore. What I am basically talking<br/>\nabout it just quieting down. I know a woman that has put her son to bed at<br/>\n7:30 every single night. I, for the life of me, do not understand that, and<br/>\nmy children would NEVER have that. I had to toss a lot of routines out the<br/>\nwindow when we started homeschooling. That was about six years ago. I went<br/>\nfrom one extreme, perfectly clean house, nice schedule, DINNER TIME, (yes, I<br/>\nsaid dinner time), to either turning into a raging lunatic or just accepting<br/>\nthat our home is WELL USED and lived in, and loved. I can&#39;t remember when<br/>\nthe last time was I vacuumed two days in a row!<br/>\nAs far as routine, we have a few things that are routine. Stories before<br/>\nbed(whether bed is at 9:00 or 11:30), quiet time for our son, etc.. I agree<br/>\non what you said about if things are going smoothly and certain limits are<br/>\nokay with the kids as opposed to them feeling controlled, then there is no<br/>\nreason to change. I think one of THE most important thing I have ever<br/>\nlearned during our homeschooling life is that our life always changes. There<br/>\nmay be a few months where we are basically hibernating and staying home a<br/>\nlot, then-next thing you know, we are running all over the place several<br/>\ntimes/week for different activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I were talking after we ate dinner last night, that it would<br/>\nbe possible to have quiet time to yourself even if the kids were up in a<br/>\nlarger house than ours (an most are larger than ours :-)  ) Our house is<br/>\nquite small. Our son is 11, and I can see how when he is a little older his<br/>\ndemands and needs will be so different. I don&#39;t know what that is going to<br/>\nbring, and it may bring me saying &quot;go to sleep when you feel like you need<br/>\nto&quot; just as you are trying out. Things just change.

I&#39;m weighing in on the<br/>\n&quot;respect goes both ways&quot; side.  (I&#39;ve also noted a difference in the<br/>\nresponses based on the ages of the children--I think this is key....any<br/>\nchild who isn&#39;t old enough to be left alone unsupervised would require<br/>\ndifferent choices than a teen, for example.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t care at all what time my kids go to SLEEP, but they are required to<br/>\nrespect the needs of others in our family.  Their Dad has to get up early in<br/>\nthe morning and go to work to support our family...he needs his sleep.  They<br/>\ncan stay awake as long as they want as long as they&#39;re not disturbing<br/>\nothers.  My 3 kids have different sleep needs from each other, too, so that<br/>\nthe one who likes to stay up late has to turn his stereo off (or use<br/>\nheadphones) when the others with bedrooms near him want to go to sleep.  And<br/>\nthere are times when my husband and I want to watch a movie that isn&#39;t<br/>\nappropriate for them and we&#39;ll ask them to find something else to do.  It&#39;s<br/>\nnot a problem--there are plenty of &quot;something elses&quot; that they&#39;d rather do<br/>\nthan watch a movie....and I respect similar needs of theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the time my kids were quite little (I suppose it happened about the<br/>\ntime they moved out of our family bed and into their own rooms), I told them<br/>\nit was &quot;quiet time&quot; (as opposed to &quot;bed time&quot;).  They could find something<br/>\nquiet to do in their rooms or they could choose to turn the lights off and<br/>\ngo to sleep.   It has also been influenced a LOT by the floor plan of the<br/>\nhouses we&#39;ve lived in and the ages of my children.  Also, (Sarah--another<br/>\nthing we have in common) my husband worked shift-work for a couple of years<br/>\nand during this time, the &quot;quiet hours&quot; were different but the common theme<br/>\nwas respect for the needs of others.  &quot;Sleep&quot; is a *vital* need.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on another thread....<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was you, Pat, who asked the other day about &quot;what if they have to<br/>\nget up early in the morning&quot; and also about having time for breakfast.  We<br/>\nhad an interesting discussion about this just a couple months ago.  &quot;If they<br/>\nhave to get up early&quot; has never been an issue for us.  Since we never really<br/>\n*had* a bedtime, the kids have accepted their responsibility for their sleep<br/>\nneeds very well.  So if I remind them at night that they have an early<br/>\nmorning, they will take the initiative and get to sleep at a decent hour.<br/>\n(I suspect after a &quot;testing&quot; period, your kids will make the same<br/>\nresponsible choices, too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;eat&quot; thing was a problem from time to time, though.  Probably because<br/>\nI&#39;m overweight and have &quot;food issues&quot; myself!  One morning we were headed to<br/>\na ballet performance and before we left the house I told the kids to eat<br/>\nsome sort of quick protein because the ballet wasn&#39;t over until 2:00 and we<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t eat lunch until then.  One of them didn&#39;t eat anything and we<br/>\nargued about it in the car.  He reminded me that if HE didn&#39;t eat, then it<br/>\nwas HE who paid the consequences and that didn&#39;t have anything to do with<br/>\nme.  I replied that as long as it didn&#39;t make him grouchy or sick (his blood<br/>\nsugar was flaky from time to time as he was going through a teen growth<br/>\nspurt then), then that was true, but that I was his Mom and I worried about<br/>\nthings like that--it was my job.  We talked at length about DHS and parents<br/>\nwho don&#39;t feed their kids and what parental responsibility entailed.<br/>\nAnyway--very long discussion ensued where he told me that he was old enough<br/>\nto manage his eating habits on his own....to which we agreed that meant even<br/>\npreparing dinners and lunches.  He *is* a responsible young man and I<br/>\nrealized then that he WAS capable of these decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a discovery of freedom for both of us.  He was free to manage his own<br/>\ndiet and I was free from feeling like it was my responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read somewhere that when considering these sorts of parenting decisions,<br/>\nit helps to ask yourself if you would set these same rules for another<br/>\nadult--your spouse or sibling, maybe.  In the above scenario, if I was going<br/>\nto the ballet with my husband, I might also remind him that we&#39;d need to eat<br/>\na late lunch (as I am generally assumed to be the &quot;scheduler&quot; in the family,<br/>\nhe wouldn&#39;t necessarily know this), but I would never presume to TELL him<br/>\nwhat he should eat.  I&#39;m not of the belief that *every* parental decision<br/>\nwould be equal to a decision you would make for another adult, but it *does*<br/>\nhelp me to clarify where those lines are for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy lifelong-unschooler son helped me remember that the keys to this<br/>\nparenting journey are *communication* and *flexibility*.  I set some<br/>\nboundaries; he challenged them; I listened to his arguments; he listened to<br/>\nmine; we refined the boundaries to better suit both of us.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Leslie Moyer / Oklahoma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":65209951,"authorName":"KingsDaughterThe@aol.com","from":"KingsDaughterThe@...","profile":"puppypad2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: quiet time after kids bed time","postDate":"1010505357","msgId":30781,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1Yy42NzhmYTRlLjI5NmM3MDhkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":30777,"nextInTopic":30783,"prevInTime":30780,"nextInTime":30782,"topicId":30501,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/8/2002 10:29:57 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...

So then, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; only then, we buy Bazooka. Yes, Bazooka. It has refinded sugar BUT it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t have a lot of the other crap that a lot of gums have.

And Jellybeans with malt sugar or <br/>\nfruit juice.<br/>\n<br/>\nJellos and puddings are also available.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there&#39;s a great line of honey sweetened cereals available now.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn *rare* occasion when we&#39;re away or out and about, my son wants &#39;bubble <br/>\ngum&#39;, since the Peelu is minty and he thinks is too spicy. So then, and <br/>\nonly then, we buy Bazooka. Yes, Bazooka. It has refinded sugar BUT it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have a lot of the other crap that a lot of gums have. And it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have aspartme (sp) which is deadlier than refinded sugar.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeeping these treats in my purse, or in a goodie backpack that we drag <br/>\naround, is a great way to keep outside influences from making my son feel <br/>\nslighted.<br/>\n<br/>\nTV advertisements does make it hard on me. BUT, luckily the health food <br/>\ncommunity has come FAR from the &#39;wheatgrass only&#39; days and now we can get <br/>\nsome yogurt squeezies (Stonyfield) and some ice pops and *almost* <br/>\neverything else that is marketed towards children sans the junky <br/>\nchemicals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no problems when he goes into the goodie drawer (the ex-big-bread <br/>\ndrawer) and takes what he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nkolleen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84135975,"authorName":"Pat Cald...","from":"&quot;Pat Cald...&quot; &lt;homeschoolmd@...&gt;","profile":"homeschoolmd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Sweets YES/Sugar NO!","postDate":"1009839902","msgId":30505,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTUwMWMxOTI0ZiQ5NDg4MGI2MCQwMjAxYThjMEBkZXNrdG9wPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDExMjMxMjIzNS5mQlZNWjZZaTAyNjI0OUBueWNzbXRwMm91dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":30501,"nextInTopic":30506,"prevInTime":30504,"nextInTime":30506,"topicId":30501,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So Kolleen, is your house sugar free?
