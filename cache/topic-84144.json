I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t recommend any titles as I learned this <br/>\ntrade by just diving in and doing stuff. (I was in the right place at the <br/>\nright time to get into the computer games biz with very little animation <br/>\ntraining -- I learned 98 percent of my animation skills on-the-job.) But I <br/>\nunderstand there&#39;s a book put out by Disney that&#39;s pretty good.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, quality computer animation software tends to be expensive. <br/>\nThe program I used to make the Singing Klingon, 3D Studio MAX, costs around <br/>\n$3,500. A less expensive but good alternative is Lightwave -- sometimes you <br/>\ncan find used copies for a decent price (whereas the makers of 3DS MAX has <br/>\nsome clause in their license which prevents people from legally selling <br/>\nused copies of that program).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a $300 program available called Hash 3D Animation Studio, which is <br/>\ngenerally not bad (except for version 5 which was extremely buggy) but <br/>\ntends to live in its own world and is not interoperable with any other <br/>\ngraphics software package.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if you&#39;re not averse to bootleg software for educational purposes, <br/>\nboth of these programs can be found using one of the commonly available <br/>\nfile-sharing programs (Kazaa or BearShare). You won&#39;t get the manuals, of <br/>\ncourse, but you can usually find books at your local CompuUSA or whatever <br/>\nthat will fill the need.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids are into playing Quake, there are shareware programs available <br/>\nfor making custom Quake characters (called &quot;models&quot;). The benefit to these <br/>\nis they tend to automate a lot of the difficult stuff (such as building <br/>\nanimation hierarchies between bodyparts) while teaching the basics <br/>\n(creating and manipulating basic shapes, and creating and applying <br/>\ntextures), and reward the user with a working model in a relatively short <br/>\ntime frame.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, many parents object to the graphic violence of Quake so this is <br/>\nnot an option for them. Unfortunately I don&#39;t know of any alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor 2D animation, the industry standard seems to be Macromedia Flash. Also <br/>\nkind of pricey, but a lot less so than the 3D packages.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the truly budget minded there are a variety of gif animation shareware <br/>\npackages available, although what my son Zeke likes best is the gif <br/>\nanimation features in Adobe Photoshop (from version 6 forward).<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--Scott Bieser<br/>\nproprietor, LibertyArtworx.com<br/>\nProfessional Graphics and Personal Opinions<br/>\nhttp://www.libertyartworx.com<br/>\nBuy stuff with my art on it!<br/>\nhttp://www.cafepress.com/libartworx<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.536 / Virus Database: 331 - Release Date: 11/3/2003<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162967824,"authorName":"Dawn Adams","from":"&quot;Dawn Adams&quot; &lt;Wishbone@...&gt;","profile":"bluenosegoddess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Scott","postDate":"1068318152","msgId":84213,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWUwMWMzYTYyYSRkZGU5NTcwMCQ4ZDRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGE1LjQxYTcyNzk5LjJjZGU4OTExQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":84206,"nextInTopic":84222,"prevInTime":84212,"nextInTime":84214,"topicId":84144,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Firstly, I m not sure myself that it will work.

Just a short introduction for everyone...I&#39;m a an unschooling mom to a 5 yr old girl and 2 yr old boy. I was pretty quick to accept unschooling (though by no means have I deschooled myself enough, ah well, I think that may be a long battle). I started looking at school options last January thinking homeschooling was weird. By Feb. I was determined to homeschool but thought unschooling was nuts. By May I came out to myself and realized it was what I wanted to do. I think I was an unschooler at heart. :) My daughter certainly is. It&#39;s absolutely stunning to watch her take control of her education.<br/>\n        I saved that &#39;lazy&#39; quote above because I&#39;m becoming more convinced that laziness really isn&#39;t a natual state for kids or at least mine. I see it in my daughter only, a) when she&#39;s reacting to my intermittant attempts to be an over-controlling and downright rude parent. She just shuts down in rebellion, or b) she isn&#39;t doing what I, at any given moment, think she should be doing (she&#39;s watching TV when I decide she should be cleaning her room so she must be lazy (Even if I haven&#39;t asked her to clean her room). For me, Laziness in Catherine is either a reaction to my behaviour towards her or a judgement I make in the context of what I think she should be doing. Does that make sense? Anyway, I thought I&#39;d share that in case it was of some help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Lysander Spooner was Re: Scott","postDate":"1068314416","msgId":84206,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4ZS4yMjBhZjM2NS4yY2RlODkzMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":84205,"nextInTopic":84213,"prevInTime":84205,"nextInTime":84207,"topicId":84144,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/8/03 9:54:35 AM, SandraDodd@aol.com writes:  Reverend.

Zeke went to government school until 2/3 of the <br/>\nway through third grade, and Ian made it nearly that far through the 1st <br/>\ngrade before I &quot;liberated&quot; him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI adopted libertarianism as my political philosophy more than a quarter <br/>\ncentury ago, and homeschooling is very much in line with libertarian <br/>\nprinciples. However, there is often a gap between theory and practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main reasons I had not homeschooled Zeke from the beginning were that, <br/>\nin the first place, both my wife and I had full-time jobs located several <br/>\nmiles from home (mine was roughly 50 miles away); and in the second place, <br/>\nmy wife, &quot;EJ,&quot; is the daughter of two government school career teachers and <br/>\nwas not at all sympathetic to the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nZeke is a bright lad but had continuing &quot;anger management&quot; and disciplinary <br/>\nissues from Kindergarten on. Eventually things came to a head when he was <br/>\nin third grade -- I won&#39;t relate the details here in the interests of his <br/>\nprivacy, but &quot;the blow-up&quot; resulted in unwanted visits by police and a <br/>\nChild Protective Services thug which were traumatic enough for us that my <br/>\nwife agreed to let me homeschool Zeke. (Up until that time Zeke used his <br/>\nfirst name, &quot;Sean.&quot; After then, wanting a clean break from the past I <br/>\nsuppose, he started using the short form of his middle name, Ezekiel.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe worked it through the baby-sitters for a while, trying the <br/>\n&quot;school-at-home&quot; approach. It didn&#39;t work very well, but things changed <br/>\nwhen I was laid off from my job. I have since started a home-based <br/>\nbusiness, which allows me to deal with the job directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my wife thought of Zeke as a special case, and there was no reason not <br/>\nto put Ian into the same school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIan also had &quot;discipline&quot; problems of a different sort. He simply politely <br/>\nrefused to go along with whatever the class was doing. &quot;No thanks!&quot; Since <br/>\nhe wasn&#39;t being abusive or particularly disruptive, they didn&#39;t know how to <br/>\nhandle him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo midway through the first grade they decided that he was &quot;learning <br/>\nimpaired,&quot; and called EJ and me in for a conference. They wanted to put him <br/>\nin a &quot;special program&quot; for kids &quot;like Ian.&quot; All of this sent off alarms in <br/>\nEJ&#39;s head, and she consented to let me take Ian out of that place and into <br/>\nour homeschool, which is named &quot;Lysander Spooner Academy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(Extra bonus points for anyone here who knows who Lysander Spooner was.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way we are working currently, I have Zeke registered with the <br/>\n&quot;Discovery&quot; on-line curriculum program, giving him assignments 4 or 5 days <br/>\nper week. He has been having special difficulty with math, so I supplement <br/>\nthat with the &quot;Math Made Easy&quot; kit, which seems to be helping.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Ian, we&#39;ve purchased some basic phonics and arithmetic workbooks, and <br/>\nencourage him to work with these by stipulating that if he wants to play <br/>\nhis computer games that day or wrestle with Dad in the evening then he has <br/>\nto do a certain amount of work first.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe go on occasional &quot;field trips&quot; to the museums and suchlike, and twice a <br/>\nmonth we meet with our local home-schooling support group at an area park.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not really satisfied with all of this. I&#39;ve heard of the &quot;un-schooling&quot; <br/>\nphilosophy from some of the moms at the homeschool group, and read up a bit <br/>\non it. I find it very appealing philosophically, but again there are two <br/>\nissues which have so far prevented me from diving in.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, I&#39;m not sure myself that it will work. My boys are lazy and it <br/>\nseems like if left to their own devices they&#39;d just watch TV and play with <br/>\ntoys or computer games all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, I have to deal with _two_ mothers (Zeke is from a previous <br/>\nmarriage) who are not libertarians or sympathetic to the idea of <br/>\nchild-directed learning. Zeke&#39;s mom (Melissa) wants to make sure that he <br/>\nhas whatever preparation he needs to get into college. EJ is still very <br/>\nmuch stuck in the regimented mind-set of &quot;schooling&quot; (although she rebels <br/>\nagainst it in other, interesting ways) and regards what happened in the <br/>\ngovernment school as &quot;a basically good system that&#39;s currently broken.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I subscribed to this group in hopes of gathering some information that <br/>\nwill help me bolster my case (and fully convince myself) that un-schooling <br/>\nis a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there you have it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12:06 PM 11/7/2003, Penn Acres wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Your unschooling &quot;tract&quot; cards? sounds kewl-have to have a better look at <br/>\n&gt;your site  asap.<br/>\n&gt;  prob. deleted your unschooling bio-how old are your kids?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All kidding aside, I agree it would not be a good idea to hand out tracts <br/>\nabout homeschooling to strangers&#39; children.
