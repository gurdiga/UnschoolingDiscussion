Tracy (a LLL leader, and a firm<br/>\n&gt; &gt; believer in the benefits of breastfeeding) emailed me off list and asked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about my reasons for feeding my children the way I do.

This, on the other hand, is nothing but inflammatory.<br/>\n&gt;   I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could respond to this post by explaining some of the valid reasons for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bottlefeeding, but I won&#39;t because you don&#39;t deserve my consideration.<br/>\n&gt; You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; established that with the tone of your post.  Clearly you decided not to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; honor the request that I made about keeping this kind of attitude off of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; list, or even posting about breastfeeding under the subject line<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;breastfeeding&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There ARE valid reasons for bottlefeeding.

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-799723972\">Stephanie, without meaning to totally offend (sorry!), is your husband<br/>\ntotally nuts?  He&#39;s willing to sacrifice you baby&#39;s/child&#39;s/future<br/>\nadult&#39;s health?  I firmly believe that if someone is educated in the<br/>\ntrue merits of breastfeeding there would be no &quot;choice&quot; in infant<br/>\nnutrition.  It is absolutely the most superior wonder food in existence<br/>\non the planet and no informed person could possibly deny that for their<br/>\nchild.  It&#39;s like choosing to eat scraps from the dumpster instead of<br/>\nopting for tasty, delicious and healthy food in your own well-stocked<br/>\nkitchen.  No one who has the choice chooses dumpster food!  Not only<br/>\nwill nursing supply your baby with an immune system and sustain your<br/>\nchild even through illness (it&#39;s the perfect medicinal food when your<br/>\nbaby has a cold or diarrhea or is vomiting) but the health benefits last<br/>\nwell into adulthood.  Lower rates of allergies, sensitivities, diabetes,<br/>\neven cancers.  This is all well documented.  Babies fed ARTIFICIAL food<br/>\nsuch as formula, or worse, COW&#39;S MILK have higher statistics on<br/>\neverything negative except maybe brain development.  Which has been<br/>\nwell-documented for breast-fed babies:  higher intelligence for the<br/>\namino acids present in breast milk.  No formula can replicate that!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry to be on this tirade but I positively see red when I see<br/>\npeople think there is a &quot;choice&quot; and usually for the sake of unimportant<br/>\nand temporary situations such as convenience or lifestyle.  How can any<br/>\nloving parent deny their child what is clearly theirs?  Boy, have the<br/>\nformula companies or, dare I say it, the radical feminists, really<br/>\nsnowed us that much, all these years?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure I&#39;m making a few enemies tonight with these views but 10 solid<br/>\nyears of research into the subject have brought me to these conclusions.<br/>\nYes, most babies will grow according to the growth charts<br/>\n(interestingly-enough supplied by the formula companies) when fed by<br/>\nartificial means, but most of the time we are forfeiting quality for<br/>\nquantity (the pounds babies gain).  People can seem to grow and gain<br/>\nweight eating dumpster food too...Formula is made of &quot;Scraps&quot; and<br/>\nby-products:  leftover and sour milk processed into powders, the lowest<br/>\ngrades of corn syrup, coconut and palm oils (recognized poison for the<br/>\nheart) and a few fake versions of vitamins.  Mechanically-produced and<br/>\nrarely efficiently absorbed by the system. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I say, there is no true choice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSign me,<br/>\n<br/>\na radical-baby&#39;s-rights-defender<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRon and Stephanie wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Karen-<br/>\n&gt; Yep, you got it!<br/>\n&gt; here I am asking you another question about abb. words:  is LLL Le Leche<br/>\n&gt; League?<br/>\n&gt; I am very interested in LLL.
