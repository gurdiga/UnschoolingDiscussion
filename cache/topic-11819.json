I think one of the main reasons I took my daughter out of school after 2nd grade is that I saw my inquisitive, motivated, life-loving child start ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1552809806\">Hi guys!<br/>\n<br/>\n I think one of the main reasons I took my daughter out of school after 2nd <br/>\ngrade is that I saw my inquisitive, motivated, life-loving child start <br/>\navoiding reading, writing and anything which could be construed as learning.  <br/>\n My daughter kept asking why she had to learn that stuff.  She&#39;s very strong <br/>\nwilled and persistent.  Every single homework assignment it seemed she would <br/>\nask, &quot;Why do I have to do this?&quot;  Respnding,&quot;Because you have to&quot; got really <br/>\nold after a while.  Part of me wished she would just go with the program and <br/>\nstop thinking for herself!!!! (uuuggh) But that&#39;s just not her (thank God)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was our first year unschooling and I can&#39;t seem to bring myself to use <br/>\nany of the &#39;worksheet&#39; books I purchased when we first started.  It just <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t fit for me to use something which has no context, or meaning behind <br/>\nit.  I know that if she finds a need to go to college she will find the means <br/>\nto learn what she needs to know.  She is extremely resourseful.  And yes, it <br/>\ndoes take some trust.  But I know that for right now it is working for us.  <br/>\n(We do &#39;games&#39; and some computer programs, and &#39;life&#39; problems, but so far <br/>\nhaven&#39;t done any &#39;sit down&#39; math, she&#39;s 9)<br/>\n I also know I was completely incompetent in high school, and that when I <br/>\nwent to college 10 years later, my gpa was a 4.0.  Mostly it was because I <br/>\nwanted to be there.  I still didn&#39;t believe memorizing was &#39;learning&#39;, but it <br/>\nwas mine, with no one telling me I had to go.  I think my daughter has some <br/>\nof that rebelliousness in her.  Like any quality, it seems at times it can be <br/>\na great blessing, and at others a disadvantage. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to add this, an excerpt from &quot;The Schools Our Children Deserve&quot; by <br/>\nAlphie Kohn <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...studies can be cited to prove that the Old School [standardized testing, <br/>\nrepetetive drills, etc] is successful.  But here&#39;s the catch: success can be <br/>\nclaimed only by those who don&#39;t care about the three other goals: (a) long-ter<br/>\nm retention of these facts or skills, (b) a real understanding of ideas, <br/>\nalong with critical thinking, creativity, the capacity to apply skills to <br/>\ndifferent kinds of tasks, and other more sophisticated intellectual outcomes, <br/>\nor (c) students&#39; interest in what they&#39;re doing, and the likelihood that <br/>\nthey&#39;ll come away with a continuing motivation to learn.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLooove this book :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings all,,,,,Jennifer</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Nanci and Thomas Kuykendall","from":"&quot;Nanci and Thomas Kuykendall&quot; &lt;tn-k4of5@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"UxrYyxs6dUHgMPiyMSbELiMFS0v8Mz6-BrAH5RXuAfKOwlnhCB_6-MEnEVckZ5ESjRQl3M6ZFEXuNLAlGYWUJhAfibbz0gENQcGJpWq0ECR2fFLbFHlGnpjIHksMCQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom]problem with my 9yo ds.....","postDate":"965605568","msgId":11819,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwODA2MjM0Ni5RQUExNDA2M0BtYWlsMTguYmlnbWFpbGJveC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11824,"prevInTime":11818,"nextInTime":11820,"topicId":11819,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
