I&#39;ll be reading through messages <br/>\nthere and consider responding to something and then realize that I&#39;m <br/>\nabout to respond to something that is a year or two old.  **<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve recently reset the boards interface so that new conversations will <br/>\nappear at the top of the list and I&#39;m gradually reordering old conversations so <br/>\noldest are last (removing truly outdated and useless stuff as I go - some stuff <br/>\nis timeless). I *think* that should help with the problem of folks <br/>\ninadvertantly responding to very old messages because they didn&#39;t notice the date.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d appreciate hearing (in the message boards Suggestions folder <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/3583/3583.html\">http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/3583/3583.html</a> ) what other changes users might <br/>\nlike to see.
