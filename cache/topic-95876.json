We stayed at a hotel.  Half hour <br/>\naway.  Too much trouble for all of us to be at her house.  For HER.  She doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to have to clean up after any one.  She wants her house to look perfect <br/>\nin case someone drops by... HELLO, we are dropping by... about once a year <br/>\nlately is all...<br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t want anyone to eat there because a meal for that MANY makes too <br/>\nmuch of a mess, so &quot;try to get something to eat before you come over&quot; is what <br/>\nwe hear.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s sad.  I would be APPALLED if my children ever came home to visit from a <br/>\nmany hours drive and stayed in a hotel.  I would be shocked if they ate <br/>\nelsewhere while home visiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nTen years ago or so we visited and when we got over there, the kids saw piles <br/>\nand piles of pretty pink and yellow and blue cupcakes sitting all over the <br/>\ncounters.  Of course they ask their Granny if they can have one.  She said NO, <br/>\nthey are for my Sunday School class tomorrow, I like to spoil them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to try to come up with an explanation as to why Granny doesn&#39;t like to <br/>\nspoil them.  There were more than enough cupcakes btw, I think she just wanted <br/>\neven the very young of the family to know their place in her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow they know it well.  She&#39;s taught them they don&#39;t matter to her.  She <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matter so much to them after twenty some years or so of being taught that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s very sad.  Things being more important than people.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI figure one day I&#39;ll have plenty of time to clean and paint and redo the <br/>\nhouse if that&#39;s what I really want to do, right now time with my children is <br/>\nlimited.  One day they will have SO that occupy their world full time.

The dad bought the boy a new baseball<br/>\nglove, but then never had time to play catch with him - too busy making<br/>\nmoney.  That song has always made me cry, even before I had kids.  Over the<br/>\nyears I&#39;ve tried to keep its message in mind, so have bought special things<br/>\nor classes  for the kids when we had the money but also tried hard to spend<br/>\nmuch time with them.  Really that&#39;s the reason we began homeschooling - to<br/>\nhave  more time with our children so that they wouldn&#39;t become grown and<br/>\ngone, strangers to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe discussion also reminded me of the poem about &quot;Handprints on the Wall.&quot;<br/>\nSame idea - other things can become so important to parents that they stop<br/>\nseeing their children.  A clean house becomes priority over the spending<br/>\ntime together and having fun, enjoying our children while they&#39;re home with<br/>\nus (or later when they come back to visit).<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95891,"nextTopicId":95762}}
