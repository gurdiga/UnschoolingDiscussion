Anyway....<br/>\nHere&#39;s what my boys have been &quot;just&quot; doing with legos all day.<br/>\nThey have some propellor parts and they&#39;ve been making different things with <br/>\nthe propellors attached and testing out their ideas over a fan directed at <br/>\nthe ceiling on full blast.<br/>\nTrevor had one creation hovering, but he&#39;s been struggling with another style <br/>\nthat he really wants to get off the ground so to speak, but is having trouble <br/>\nwith too much weight, wrong shape etc... <br/>\nSo he has reworked it at LEAST 20 times and tested it out again and again and <br/>\nagain....<br/>\n&quot;Just&quot; legos have been a source of learning on engineering, wind resistance, <br/>\nlift, drag and basic dynamics of flight.<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t need to know all that, he&#39;s just having fun.  It&#39;s amazing what <br/>\nkids will learn about their world through play.<br/>\nHow could I impose what I think they need, when they so obviously know <br/>\nexactly how to explore and learn about their world in the MOST meaningful way <br/>\nfor their own life?<br/>\n<br/>\nI just looked over and Trevor has taken a break from his experimenting to <br/>\nshow Sierra some letter sounds on the GeoSafari. This kind of stuff would <br/>\nnever happen if the trust wasn&#39;t there FIRST.<br/>\nShe&#39;s reading at five years old, and she KNOWS she taught herself. She says <br/>\n&quot;you showed me stuff Mom, but I learned it all by myself&quot;. What confidence, <br/>\nwhat balance, what self-knowledge these autodidacts possess!!
