The last <br/>\n&gt; year of<br/>\n&gt; his life, Mitch was in charge of the *schooling* while at home <br/>\n&gt; undergoing<br/>\n&gt; chemotherapy, it was the coolest year of my children&#39;s lives ~ even if <br/>\n&gt; he had<br/>\n&gt; to *do* worksheets to feel like he was doing something ~ the Truth of <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; matter is, they learned more just by being around him and his doctors<br/>\n&gt; appointments than the could ever learn from a workbook page!!  We <br/>\n&gt; still have<br/>\n&gt; all the workbooks laying around, but now they&#39;re used as a memorial to <br/>\n&gt; Mitch<br/>\n&gt; ;) definitely not my style.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to think we live in the coolest place on earth for <br/>\n&gt; unschooling and<br/>\n&gt; inspiring all of us ~ the Black Hills.  This place is considered by <br/>\n&gt; many to<br/>\n&gt; be the spiritual center of the universe... I certainly feel calmer and <br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; centered since moving here 7 months ago!  We are already planning our<br/>\n&gt; expeditions for summer ~ lots of camping and hiking.  Hayden&#39;s excited <br/>\n&gt; to see<br/>\n&gt; his very first snake!  We&#39;ve been doing lots of reading about the area <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; what to expect while we&#39;re out ~ I&#39;ve learned more in the past 7 <br/>\n&gt; months than<br/>\n&gt; I did living in this state (and attending public school) for 18 <br/>\n&gt; years!! (I<br/>\n&gt; spent almost 8 years in CA and have been back to SD for 9 years)<br/>\n&gt; We do lots of TV, too :) since this was brought up!  It&#39;s on all day, <br/>\n&gt; watched<br/>\n&gt; minimally.  I&#39;d personally rather discuss things with my kids than <br/>\n&gt; shelter<br/>\n&gt; them and create *forbidden fruit* where it doesn&#39;t need to be.  For <br/>\n&gt; example,<br/>\n&gt; I was told the first Lord of the Rings was incredibly violent and we <br/>\n&gt; missed<br/>\n&gt; our chance to see it on the big screen ~ I watched the video and kicked<br/>\n&gt; myself!!  It is now one of our family&#39;s favorite DVDs and we went to <br/>\n&gt; Two<br/>\n&gt; Towers on opening day!

We saw the *Making of <br/>\n&gt; StarWars* ~<br/>\n&gt; Hayden was beside himself with excitement when he saw that George <br/>\n&gt; Lucas was<br/>\n&gt; just a regular guy with an incredible imagination.
