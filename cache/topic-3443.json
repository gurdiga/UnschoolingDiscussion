She was asked what she thought and she said that she thought that Mama was<br/>\ndoing it.  This was confirmed and my daughter chortled with laughter she thought it<br/>\nwas wonderful that mama was going around the house doing all this Easter stuff.  She<br/>\nthought it was funny too.  No resentment or upset re: being &quot;lied&quot; to.  She saw it<br/>\nfor what it was,  an attempt on the parents part to delight their children with a<br/>\nmagical play (which for us has little religious significance).  We have talked a<br/>\nlittle bit about the many world religions which have their god figure either die or<br/>\nbe killed, and who then comes back to life.  She is only moderately interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t try to &quot;trick&quot; the children about Santa (who we have bring gifts every<br/>\nChristmas) but as they have grown up the older one finally asked point blank about<br/>\nSanta because she already had reasoned that it didn&#39;t really make sense.  She wasn&#39;t<br/>\ndisappointed as we merely confirmed what she knew.  She then participated in the<br/>\nfiction with her sister.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe answer the questions with &quot;What do you think?&quot;  and leave it at that unless they<br/>\nget to the point blank stage where they want confirmation or denial of their<br/>\nopinion.  I used to worry about it but am reassured by how the kids have responded.<br/>\nThey really sense the intention of this kind of myth/game/play/theatre/ and because<br/>\nwe do not try to &quot;convince&quot; them of the &quot;reality&quot; of the myth they don&#39;t seem to feel<br/>\nconflicted about it.

Adults<br/>\ncan very easily understand play acting, and can make easy distinctions<br/>\nbetween what is real and what is not.  Play acting does not make me more<br/>\ncynical.  But this is much more difficult for children.  (I think you<br/>\nare covering for them, thinking that since it has no such effect upon<br/>\nyou as an adult, it is unlikely to have such an effect on kids.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this isn&#39;t the real issue anyway.  The important aspect is how we<br/>\ncan co-create stories, myths, rituals, meaning with our kids, so that we<br/>\ncan grow together as families.  The Santa Claus thing, taken by itself<br/>\nis static -- it doesn&#39;t change, except that the kids&#39; expectations for<br/>\nlarger presents grow.  If we can find ways to use Santa Claus in a way<br/>\nwhich nurtures a child&#39;s natural sense of good will -- the Santa Claus<br/>\nwithin -- then it can become very powerful indeed.  But the fact that<br/>\nSanta comes with so much baggage attached makes it that much more<br/>\ndifficutlt.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n--<br/>\nMy book &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me: Adventures in Homeschooling and<br/>\nCommunity-Based Education&quot; will be off the press around September 30.<br/>\nTo read a sample chapter, reviewers&#39; comments, or the foreword, visit my<br/>\nwebsite at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.skylarksings.com\">http://www.skylarksings.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"MORELFAM@xxx.xxx","from":"MORELFAM@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"djIw_JH9tRZyNRECCdRgXu4w5dr33r2rw6VL4BY3xyHpWomqYvN_JvcDh8bwmzkKDtvzB9icEA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Christian counter culture","postDate":"938750718","msgId":3482,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMzQuMzQ4Mi45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3475,"nextInTopic":3488,"prevInTime":3481,"nextInTime":3483,"topicId":3443,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1560778971\">&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;  We do not do Santa (or<br/>\n  that bunny or fairy either) just cause it is like lying.  &gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;When children realize that adults have<br/>\nbeen lying to them about the easter bunny and Santa Claus,  they<br/>\ninevitably wonder what else they have been lied to about.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nwhen my first child was little i wondered if she would feel this way, but i <br/>\nhave come to a place where i realize that kids dont see it the way an adult <br/>\nwould-- feeling betrayed, etc.  i think, as several others have mentioned, <br/>\nthat they would be more likely to become more cynical and more likely to lose <br/>\nthe sense of the magical and mysterious if you take these untangibles away.  <br/>\nperhaps we are all projecting our own reactions onto our children, which is <br/>\nonly natural.  we didnt do santa (etc) at my home growing up and i really <br/>\nstill dont get as easily stirred up as some about the magical and mysterious! <br/>\n i have had a disadvantage there i think and am sooo glad that the religion <br/>\nthat is my own has plenty of it to ignite those other senses besides <br/>\nintellectual...  it is easy to just &quot;be practical&quot; for me, but if that is our <br/>\nfocus we sure miss out on a lot...  honesty is important but it is not about <br/>\nthat.  if we look deeper than face value and literalism-- we can see that we <br/>\ncan share the &quot;embodiment of&quot; or &quot;spirit of&quot; without literally saying &quot;sorry <br/>\nkiddos, its all a lie!&quot;<br/>\nerin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Monica L.
