I missed story time","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-890603706\">Hello Pam,<br/>\n<br/>\nI was labeled math excelled in K and left my happy teacher and room with 1 <br/>\nother smart guy to be drilled with 2-3 grade math. I missed story time and <br/>\nfree play. Got back to the room for recess and nap. For the whole year. Sad. <br/>\nI knew my math facts because I snuck into my big brother and sister&#39;s books <br/>\nand played math and school when I was 3-4 years old. I have a photographic <br/>\nmemory, so I looked smart to the Kindergarden teacher and voila, my path was <br/>\nset for me. I have since always fely uncomfortable with language arts. I was <br/>\nmath smart, right? They even thought I was reading delayed in 1st grade and <br/>\ntested me. Hello, I missed reading in K, make any sense. So, for the rest of <br/>\nmy ps career, I felt dumb and brilliant. Weird for self-esteem. I got by <br/>\ndoing minimum always. I was AP math and finished community college calculus <br/>\nmy senior year of HS. I had to redo english again and again. I&#39;m still <br/>\naffected I think, from this early label of math smart.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn college I found plants and my passion. I picked a career in horticulture. <br/>\nI&#39;m finally comfortable because I know my strengths. I&#39;m great at what I do <br/>\nand I love it too, though since kids I really do not work for money. I <br/>\nusually just get asked all kinds of plant/gardening questions from my <br/>\nfriends and their spouses and anyone else, because I love to talk plants and <br/>\nanyone who asks is going to get me going.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\nCaillou is a about a little guy and his family. Very sweet drawings. Caillou <br/>\nhas little hair and a baby sister named Rosie. Sagwa is the name of the show <br/>\nHolly likes, which mine adore. We need to figure out how to tape on the new <br/>\nVCR, since Ashley has swimming everyday when Sagwa is on.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35173,"nextTopicId":35059}}
