(1) living history/re-enactment events<br/>\nmay have a smithy set up.  If so, plan to spend the weekend at<br/>\nthat spot (2) the Farmer&#39;s Co-op or where ever folks in your area<br/>\nbuy horse stuff will have a bulletin board with business cards<br/>\nfrom farriers.  Take one of each and call until you find a<br/>\ncongenial soul who would like a hand for some training.  The<br/>\nfirst 30 or 40 plant hangers I got for Christmas came from those<br/>\nopportunities.  ...of course Santa brought him a bad of<br/>\nanthracite coal after a few years, but he was big enough to see<br/>\nthe joke - not to mention that it was offset with a new blower<br/>\nfor the forge and a new range for his apartment.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, the ultimate teenage liberation is to give them their own<br/>\napartment attached to the house - laundry room, kitchen, outside<br/>\ndoors, etc and the freedom to live as independently as they want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:genant2@...\">genant2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 08, 2003 11:54 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] learning by osmosis (was new<br/>\nmember intro)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| In a message dated 4/8/03 12:47:13 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n| <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n|<br/>\n| &gt; Holly told me last week that when she was little she had told<br/>\nthe neighbors<br/>\n| &gt; she wanted to be an artist when she grew up.
