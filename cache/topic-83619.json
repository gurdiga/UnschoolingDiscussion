(well I <br/>\ncould have, but they would have been bored to tears) They packed bags and games <br/>\nand went off to work with Darin. As I was walking out I realized I only had a <br/>\nfew dollars to hand out for snack and drink runs so I grabbed a bag of candy off <br/>\nthe coffee table and took it out to the car. As I handed it to Moly I had a <br/>\nmomentary thought that maybe this might not be a good idea because one bag <br/>\nwould be eaten out of and the kids might fight doing the &quot;this is my bag&quot; thing. <br/>\nBut I put that thought out of my head because things have been going so good <br/>\nand why should I think something negative? (does anyone else think my kids are <br/>\nfurther on this path than me? &lt;g&gt;) I went on with my day. This evening I asked <br/>\nDarin how his day went with the kids at work with him and specifically asked <br/>\nabout the candy. He told me that they both came to him about three and asked <br/>\nfor the keys to the car and that they came back with just a few pieces each and <br/>\na pocket full each to give to the &quot;guys&quot; who work for Darin. No mention that <br/>\nMom only brought one bag or that it was Moly&#39;s bag or Jack&#39;s bag. If it were me <br/>\nin that situation I would have carried the bag in with me, never let anyone <br/>\nelse touch it, never shared especially with adults, and probably would have <br/>\neaten as much as I could before it was taken from me. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma2kids","from":"&quot;zenmomma2kids&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Halloween candy","postDate":"1067830481","msgId":83670,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJvNGljaCtydXAwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMjcwMWMzYTFhZSRjOWQ3MDgwMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":83666,"nextInTopic":83671,"prevInTime":83669,"nextInTime":83671,"topicId":83619,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ways.

I am &quot;costume impaired&quot;.  Jackie decided to be a telletubbie by wearing her telletubbie pajamas with a layer of clothes underneath and a pillow to make her tummie fat.  Lisa couldn&#39;t decide.  I was racking my brains trying to think what we had laying around that could become a costume.  I remembered that we have some reflective vests, so I suggested she wear that and carry a stop flag (easily made with computer and an old broom handle) and practically everybody recognized her as a school crossing guard.  Hmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are eating the candy throughout the day but are eating plenty of other stuff too.  Yesterday the neighbor girl was over all day.  When her mom called to have her come home, she (the mom) told me that her 3 kids put all their candy together in one bowl, decided how long they wanted the candy to last, then figured out how many pieces that could each have per day.  After Allison went home, Jackie told me that she had said they are only allowed to eat 2 pieces of candy per day.  I told Jackie what the mom had told me, saying that she had said it was the kid&#39;s idea to do that.  Jackie said that wasn&#39;t how Allison made it sound.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about the 2 piece rule this morning when Jackie opened a pack of starbursts, but they weren&#39;t the flavor she likes.  I said just toss those back in the bowl and open another package.  Yesterday she&#39;d taken a bite of a candy and didn&#39;t like it.  I said throw it away and grab something else.

It really must be a pretty awesome<br/>\nthing to experience this for the first time as a little kid! &lt;bg&gt; But when<br/>\nwe got back to the house, his mom swooped in and took the bag and said he<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have that until the next day because she didn&#39;t want him to eat the<br/>\ncandy in the late evening.  How frustrating!!  He just got all these<br/>\ninteresting, colorful little packages all thrown together in a bag and now<br/>\nhe can&#39;t LOOK at it?!  So, I told her to let him look at the stuff and show<br/>\nher what he got, etc.  She reluctantly let him and guess what?

This was probably the third (?) Halloween with no candy restrictions on <br/>\nmy part. (except that Darin or I have to check it first) The first year was <br/>\nhell (for me) because they gorged.

This year, and it is only the <br/>\nfirst night after, but so far I think there has only been five or six pieces <br/>\neaten from each bag. Not that I am counting, but since the only rule is they have <br/>\nto let me check the candy before they eat it, I see how much has been eaten. <br/>\nSome might say it took three years to get to this point, but I say the candy <br/>\nonly lasts a few weeks and it is only once a year so by my count this only took <br/>\nabout a month. &lt;g&gt; Three years ago they wouldn&#39;t have shared or wanted to <br/>\nunless forced.

Three years <br/>\nago there would have been careful counting and inventory taken, making sure each <br/>\ngot the lions share of the wealth, this year they have just reached in when <br/>\nthe mood struck and picked what they wanted and left the rest. <br/>\nAnother small step!<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83497,"nextTopicId":83678}}
