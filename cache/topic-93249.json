It&#39;s about a boy <br/>\nwho is visited in his dreams by a number devil, who shows him all <br/>\nsorts of fun ways that numbers interact. It&#39;s not purely about <br/>\nalgebra (since that&#39;s a fairly artificial construct separating some <br/>\ntypes of working with numbers from others) but it does include <br/>\nsections on stuff like exponents, prime numbers, factorials, the <br/>\nFibonnaci sequence, and other stuff. The number devil has funny names <br/>\nfor things (like prime numbers are prima donna numbers) and in <br/>\ngeneral it&#39;s a fun story that explains concepts in graphic ways. <br/>\nAnother story book that involves math that he enjoyed is &quot;The man who <br/>\ncounted.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180083488,"authorName":"sweetbo3boys","from":"&quot;sweetbo3boys&quot; &lt;sweetbo3boys@...&gt;","profile":"sweetbo3boys","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Help?
