Linda Dobson&#39;s <br/>\nHomeschool Book of Answers is easy reading because you can skip all around, <br/>\nand it has lots of homeschooling moms in there.

So for elitists with only ten minutes to <br/>\ninvest, I&#39;d go with Gatto.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d give them several online sites:  HEM&#39;s, Unschooling.com and the NHEN <br/>\nintro page for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15053,"nextTopicId":15060}}
