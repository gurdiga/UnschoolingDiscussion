I appreciate this wealth of information and  I enjoy it so <br/>\nmuch.  I  feel as if I&#39;m drinking in water after being in the desert or <br/>\nsomething.  I&#39;m not sure of the parameters of posting.  Thought I&#39;d <br/>\nintroduce myself and my family.  My significant other, and I are <br/>\nparents to three amazing children, boys 12 and our daughter is 10.  <br/>\nWe&#39;ve been homeschooling for just over two years so very new to it all, <br/>\nstill.  I began school at home with a curriculum which I could tell <br/>\nimmediately was ridiculous but I continued in part to appease my <br/>\npartner and family/friends etc, and probably to cover all the bases in <br/>\nmy own mind, too.   (we have many friends who are teachers and my s.o. <br/>\nis a professor). Reading, and thinking about unschooling ;makes so much <br/>\nsense to me.  I feel as if I&#39;m  a bit alone in it, though.  I&#39;m kind of <br/>\na closet unschooler, I guess.  Still sort of &quot;pretending&quot; to do a <br/>\ncurriculum, attempting to unschool myself, playing, being, living and <br/>\nnoticing everyone&#39;s interests.    I&#39;d like to understand how to  really <br/>\nshift into unschooling, I also feel pressure at how old my kids are to <br/>\nbegin this, feel as if I need to either decide to &quot;go for it&quot; or not, <br/>\nalso not sure how to weave my work at an artist into the mix.  And how <br/>\nto begin the dialogue with my partner, it took three years for me to <br/>\nmake a case for getting the kids out of ps.  Thank you for any and all <br/>\nthoughts.   again, thanks, Ann Carlson</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105955,"nextTopicId":105961}}
