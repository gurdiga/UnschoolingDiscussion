My daughter made a birthday card for her &quot;boyfriend&quot; (they are 10 years old).  She wants to go shopping for him this afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to bed before everyone else because I was so tired from being at the campus all day for orientation, but only after I browsed Sandra&#39;s unschooling math article, and browsed mathcats, and played some of the microworlds games.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and my husband and I sat down and discussed unschooling.  He doesn&#39;t really get it I don&#39;t think, and he doesn&#39;t really say much until he gets really bothered about something else, and then he throws unschooling into the mix of stuf he doesn&#39; t like.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we talked about unschooling math, and he told me about a conversation he and Jenna had about the new housing developments that are coming, and the sewer plant, and how many times we flush the toilet and how much water, etc etc etc.  and that the sewer plant would not be large enough to handle the added load.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess this isn&#39;t really a &quot;this moment&quot; post, but it was an interesting evening anyway :o).<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Laura Padberg <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, January 12, 2006 7:15 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re:Unschooling right this minute...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I love this thread too! I think this is one of the best ways to show especially the newcomers what unschooling looks like! I have just had so much fun reading everyone&#39;s responses to this question!

We then ran to the store and picked up some items we needed and for bonus we found easy bake oven refills on clearance for only $1.18 each!!! Savannah(5) was so proud. Jonah is now drawing on the couch to a Thomas Kincade instructional video we got at the library last night, and Savannah is in the middle of what daddy is doing, which is getting our new stereo system out of the box and hooking it up.
