I&#39;m just home much more than DH is and there is a time factor involved. When he is home, he does help with the housework, too. No, he doesn&#39;t mop the floors! He sometimes does the dishes, cleans toilets, empties all the garbage (2 times a week), helps with laundry, picks up after himself, vacuums, etc. He also mows the lawn most of the time. I do it sometimes, not too often. I do most of the cooking, that&#39;s how it&#39;s always been, even before kids. If it were up to DH, we would be eating pre-packaged frozen food every night. Although, when I was recently sick as a dog, he made me a huge pot of vegetable soup, from scratch, just brimming with a variety of vegetables. It&#39;s just what I wanted. NOW THAT&#39;S LOVE! The kids help out here and there spontaneously. They mostly help me out by picking up after themselves. This somehow works out to a smooth flowing balance of running a household. We all do what we can to help each other, while taking on our own responsibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Gender roles","postDate":"1016653520","msgId":32905,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjgwMWMxZDA0NyRkMmRmNzVjMCQ5NDgzZWU0MEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMTY2NDkyMDYuMTk5OS45NTE4MC5tNUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":25640,"nextInTopic":32934,"prevInTime":32904,"nextInTime":32906,"topicId":25640,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2101439983\">&lt;&lt;the household cleanliness shouldn&#39;t then fall on the shoulders of one<br/>\nperson&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps I&#39;m dense but I didn&#39;t read the post about the mopping as though the<br/>\nwife was some sort of &quot;free help&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI stay at home, dh works &quot;outside the home&quot;.
