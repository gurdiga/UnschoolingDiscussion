Insinuating that <br/>\nthe child&#39;s father wanted him to grow up and be a man and how living with his <br/>\nlesbian aunts would be detrimental to this goal. Ward&#39;s character has a thing <br/>\nor two to say about that. &lt;g&gt; Great movie! It is a comedy/drama and one woman <br/>\ngoes through a health crisis so it gets emotional, regardless it is a <br/>\nwonderful movie.
