Leaders are people who go their own way without caring, or even<br/>\nlooking to see if anyone is following them.  &#39;Leadership qualities&#39; are not<br/>\nthe qualities that enable people to attract followers, but those that enable<br/>\nthem to do without them.  They include, at the very least, courage,<br/>\nendurance, patience, humor, flexibility, resourcefulness, determination, a<br/>\nkeen sense of reality, and the ability to keep a cool and clear head even<br/>\nwhen things are going badly.&quot;--John Holt, from &quot;Teach Your Own,&quot; pg. 68.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen<br/>\nUncoventional Ideas:  A Collection of Short Essays Which Question Mainstream<br/>\nValues<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unconventionalideas.com\">http://www.unconventionalideas.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14172,"nextTopicId":14164}}
