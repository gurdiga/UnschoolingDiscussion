In the meantime, we have a window<br/>\non the world of compulsory education that provides fodder for good<br/>\ndiscussions, and he has a job that will give him the summer to bond with the<br/>\nnew baby.

She also knows a bit about Norse mythology...thank you <br/>\nTolkien! <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a similar problem, my mom having been a public school teacher. <br/>\nBut things haven&#39;t been so bad for me, since my 17 year old has <br/>\nalways been such a reader.

They won&#39;t know to ponder what Milton meant in Paradise Lost <br/>\nor learn algebra 2.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to explain unschooling to her, but she just sighed and <br/>\nsaid, &quot;I can never get through to you&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s a retired math teacher and is probably going to be taking a 3 <br/>\nmonth job as a permanent substitute math teacher at a high school.  I <br/>\nthink that&#39;s what has probably sparked her concern.  We&#39;ve been <br/>\nunschooling several years now, and homeschooling before that, and the <br/>\nkids have never been to school. When we first decided to homeschool <br/>\nshe said that homeschooling was &quot;a slap in the face to her <br/>\nprofession&quot;.  She seemed to get over that though, and even seemed <br/>\nsupportive.  When we got into unschooling she seemed to understand <br/>\nit, even though she didn&#39;t completely agree.  Now she&#39;s acting as <br/>\nthough she doesn&#39;t even understand it at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that now that she&#39;s taking a job as a teacher, her old &quot;slap <br/>\nin the face to her profession&quot; feelings might be coming back, but <br/>\nalso genuine concern. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking of emailing her some articles about how kids learn <br/>\nthings, specifically math and literature since those were the <br/>\nspecific examples she mentioned.  I looked through Sandra&#39;s articles <br/>\nand thought maybe the Jubilation and Triangulation article? <br/>\n ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/dot/hypotenuse\">http://sandradodd.com/dot/hypotenuse</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember reading an article once about an unschooler doing stuff <br/>\nthat lead to Shakespeare.
