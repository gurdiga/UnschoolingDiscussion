He said, &quot;We can&#39;t tell if there is a problem if there is not good <br/>\ndata.&quot; I said, &quot;So, just in case there might be a problem, even though <br/>\nwe don&#39;t see any indication of one, you want the government to step in <br/>\nand exert control over our family lives (impose curriculum and <br/>\nstandardized testing), to make it easier for you to analyze us to see <br/>\nif you can FIND a problem?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - that was the gist of the debate.<br/>\n<br/>\nRob Reich is so concerned that our kids won&#39;t be good citizens because <br/>\nthey&#39;re being raised to be &quot;ethically servile&quot; to their parents beliefs <br/>\n- by which he means that kids come out of homeschooling incapable of <br/>\neven considering the possibility that others&#39; beliefs, different from <br/>\nthose of their parents, might have some validity.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian Ray and Scott Sommerville approached the debate more from a <br/>\n&quot;these are our rights&quot; point of view. My approach was more from a &quot;I <br/>\nunderstand the desire to research us because I think we&#39;re interesting, <br/>\ntoo, but you can&#39;t justify regulating us in order to do your research, <br/>\nthat&#39;s not even good research technique (changing and damaging the very <br/>\nthing you&#39;re trying to study); you have to find ways to do the research <br/>\nwithout changing the very nature of what we do.&quot; That was the only <br/>\ncontext in which unschooling came up, because I gave the example of how <br/>\nrequiring standardized testing would so warp the way my kids&#39; learning <br/>\nhappened and explained why requiring a curriculum and standardized <br/>\ntesting would not be a minor inconvenience. I pointed out other options <br/>\nto the researchers there (Rob Reich is NOT even a researcher, he&#39;s a <br/>\nphilosopher) such as in-depth interviews and case study approaches, <br/>\nthat would allow better understanding of all the variety of <br/>\nhomeschooling, rather than statistical approaches which are based on <br/>\nfinding commonalities in a set of data and generalizing from them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] OHIO- Home Schooling An Akron Beacon Journal Spec...","postDate":"1100629936","msgId":101109,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZlLjZhZjllOTguMmVjYmExYjBAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":101107,"nextInTopic":101194,"prevInTime":101108,"nextInTime":101110,"topicId":101098,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/16/2004 11:49:38 AM Central Standard Time, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: The  Bible verses pro-slavery are a major part of any civil war","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1320229513\">In a message dated 11/16/2004 11:49:38 AM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe  Bible verses pro-slavery are a major part of any civil war discussions,  <br/>\nand a (minor) part of the history of the Southern Baptist Church.
