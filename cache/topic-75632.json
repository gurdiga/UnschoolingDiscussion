Thank you for sharing. <br/>\nWe&#39;ve become very much more concientious about what we eat, in our family, <br/>\ntoo...after years of suffering from every allergy known to nature (it seems ;-), <br/>\nchronic sinusitis, and--in my case--20 years of what *appears* to be rheumatoid <br/>\narthritis but always comes up negative on the blood test/marker...<br/>\n<br/>\n  We&#39;ve made the switch almost entirely to &quot;natural&quot; beef, chicken, and pork <br/>\n(raised for us by local farmers and thus quite affordable), free-range eggs, <br/>\norganic produce (except during the winter; we have no source aside from our <br/>\ngarden and our CSA garden), and have seen our general well-being improve <br/>\ndramatically.  There are still plenty of less healthful habits that we&#39;ve yet to <br/>\neliminate (all of us love our sugar, alas), but we&#39;re making small steps and not <br/>\nonly do we see the difference in our physical well-being, we all find the deeper <br/>\ninvolvement in the entire process of acquiring and producing food (making <br/>\nfriends with the alternative farmers, joining a health food cooperative, working <br/>\ntogether in our gardens, etc. ) *and* the political/environmental <br/>\ncontributions that such actions make, to be extremely gratifying. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~ Becky~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To announce that there must be no criticism of the president,<br/>\n or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only <br/>\nunpatriotic and servile, <br/>\nbut is morally treasonable to the American public.&quot;<br/>\n---Theodore Roosevelt<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75627,"nextTopicId":75301}}
