I&#39;m pretty sure my kids do too, since they have so many things to say about what they watch on TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh, well, he has trained himself to fall asleep on the couch with the TV so loud that I can hear the dialogue from another room.  He doesn&#39;t seem to notice when I or the girls tiptoe out, slip the remote out of his hand, and lower the volume.  So I guess you are right that some people do not remain conscious while watching TV. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":42152688,"authorName":"Mary Rainer","from":"&quot;Mary Rainer&quot; &lt;mom@...&gt;","profile":"marymaidenw6","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"data/opinion/tv","postDate":"1066062797","msgId":82848,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTEwMWMzOTFhNyRiNTlmYTM5MCQyMWYwNGVkOEBtYXJ5Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":82857,"prevInTime":82847,"nextInTime":82849,"topicId":82848,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"data conforms to opinion in regards to its presentation the cup is 1/2 full the cup is half empty both are opinions, in this case both are accurate often times","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1610030830\">data conforms to opinion in regards to its presentation<br/>\nthe cup is 1/2 full<br/>\nthe cup is half empty<br/>\nboth are opinions, in this case both are accurate<br/>\noften times differing opinions  can both be accurate in my view, <br/>\n<br/>\neditorial, documentary whatever, Michael Moore, Fox, CNN, its all presented to us- to argue regarding opinion or data would be semantics I think?<br/>\n<br/>\nplease excuse my hasty comment to your reply to me Sandra, it seems perhaps I am a bit defensive,<br/>\nI turned off the computer and it kept bothering me, I couldnt believe your comment upset me, why did it?<br/>\nIm not sure, anyways, <br/>\nIm pretty familiar with the whole tv argument, several sides of it anyways, I think the data and opinions, shows and commercials are like the glass of water, its all in how you see it <br/>\nfor me its about choice and the ability to choose what works best for me, and my kids, but when I said I dont watch anything else doesnty mean my kids dont, they see it everywhere...media is entrenched in our society, <br/>\n<br/>\nI think consciousness may be key,<br/>\nI think if you are conscious when you watch(or type or eat or whatever) then you retain a clearer ability to choose and perceive objectively, but how many of us really remain conscious when watching tv?
