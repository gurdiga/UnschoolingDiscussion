I got good grades too, and a decent<br/>\nmath SAT score, because that was expected of me...my parents would have<br/>\nkicked my butt otherwise.  I then proceeded to choose a college that would<br/>\nnot require me to take any more math or science courses, because I simply<br/>\ndidn&#39;t like it and wasn&#39;t interested. Was any of that advanced math useful?<br/>\nI don&#39;t really think so, since I managed to promptly forget it as soon as I<br/>\ncould. Guess I was tired of meeting peoples&#39; expectations.<br/>\nNo one taught me how to balance a checkbook, which would have been really<br/>\nuseful. Had to figure that out on my own much later.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere in Japan, kids are doing calculus in junior high....is that a good<br/>\nthing? For some of them , maybe. For the rest, it is just one more hurdle<br/>\nthey have to jump over..because it&#39;s expected of them. I have no idea what<br/>\nI&#39;ll do if my son turns out to be interested in math because I&#39;m rather<br/>\nafraid of it, and still recovering from having it forced down my throat.<br/>\nLuckily, Dh is an engineer and will probably be able to handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHikaru</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54689,"nextTopicId":54700}}
