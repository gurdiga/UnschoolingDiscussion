There is <br/>\nsomething truely inspiring about watching my 4 year old walk up and <br/>\njust start chatting with other kids, any other kids or adults for <br/>\nthat matter.  I would definitely do the park.  I found many of my own <br/>\nfriends there &lt;g&gt;.  It might help if you try to meet other adults who <br/>\nhave children that age. Family or play dates for everyone  may help <br/>\nease the tension of meeting someone new.  If there is a support group <br/>\nin your area, I am sure she could find others her age.  Even, if you <br/>\ncould post on a local support group website in search of families <br/>\nwith other children her age who might be in a reasonable distance, I <br/>\nam sure you would get some responses. Honestly, I just think it gets <br/>\nso much harder to make friends as you get older.  Me and my <br/>\ngirlfriend are always joking around that it is like asking for a <br/>\ndate.  All the same issues: will I get rejected?  Do they already <br/>\nhave a full load of friends?  Etc.  Good luck and I guess it just <br/>\ntakes alot of time to find people that you really want to get to know <br/>\nbetter!

(We&#39;re in <br/>\nTexas and she&#39;s 12.)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is really seeking out friends her age right now.  She loves being at <br/>\nhome, loves unschooling, but she is beginning to express a desire for ps <br/>\njust to meet kids her age, which I should have added to my original post.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s also become very image-oriented lately.  I really thought, dumbly, <br/>\nthat not being in ps would help with the clique thing but not here.  She&#39;s <br/>\nvery picky about who she wants to be friends with by what their <br/>\ninterests/looks are.  We are talking a LOT about this right now and it IS <br/>\ngetting better, but it is frustating for both of us.  A lot of the problem <br/>\nis she is so mature for her age and many of the kids she meets that are her <br/>\nage are still into &#39;baby stuff&#39; as she puts it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did write this morning to one of the leaders in our support group, <br/>\nrequesting that she be able to attend the teen groups on a trial basis and <br/>\nthey have no problem with that.  (The groups are for 13 and up, so she&#39;s a <br/>\nyear away.)  That should make a huge difference since she was often the <br/>\noldest kid in all the activities we go to.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe liked the idea of a game night, so we are discussing setting up a game <br/>\nnight here in our home since our driving ability is limited right now.  I <br/>\neven got my husband to agree to take her to the skate park weekly.  She and <br/>\nI both think this is an ideal situation considering everyone there has the <br/>\nsame interest...skateboarding!!!  She&#39;s pretty thrilled with that idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also talked about setting up a reading group at Barnes and Noble for <br/>\npre-teens/young teens.  (I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t rememeber who suggested it right <br/>\noff hand, but Thanks for that idea!!)  She&#39;s reading the Harry Potter series <br/>\nand SHE suggested we start the group when the new book comes out.  She&#39;s <br/>\nalready been on the computer to pre-order the book so she&#39;ll be prepared!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is GREAT!

Six months ago, we moved into a new-to-us <br/>\nneighborhood.  We are blessed to live right next door to my <br/>\ngreat-grandparents, which has been wonderful for me and the kids.  However, <br/>\nfrom what I see, there aren&#39;t many young families here.  I&#39;ve only seen a <br/>\nhandful of children as I&#39;m driving to and from home but have never seen any <br/>\nwhile actually out of the car, in my lawn.  So, needless to say, my children <br/>\ndon&#39;t have any neighborhood friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve always lived in this general area, so we have tried out all the area <br/>\nsupport groups but my oldest daughter has had trouble making friends, simply <br/>\nbecause we&#39;ve only met about 4 or 5 kids near her age and she doesn&#39;t feel <br/>\nlike she has &#39;clicked&#39; with any of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t go to church, so that avenue is out.  She has tried the rec centers <br/>\nfor classes and to meet new people, but generally, there aren&#39;t kids her age <br/>\nin those classes either.  (Even a two year age difference can be huge at <br/>\nthis age..12.)  She has met a few kids her age with similar interests, but <br/>\nwe seem to have a hard time getting them together as they don&#39;t live nearby.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m feeling helpless but I know there has to be something I&#39;m missing here.  <br/>\nSo I&#39;m wondering where your children meet friends.  Maybe it&#39;s just this <br/>\narea, but it seems like everyone around here has very young children!  Have <br/>\nany of you experienced this and how did/do you deal with it?
