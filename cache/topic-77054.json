I have witnessed this to be true but I have two things <br/>\n<br/>\nto add that make this idea hard to swallow. First I don&#39;t believe it is their job and that it is too much to put them in <br/>\n<br/>\na position with our violence to have to forgive or understand us. When we act against our children they still want <br/>\n<br/>\nto love us but they can not see that it is our issue. They believe it is their issue, something they have caused. I <br/>\n<br/>\nhave some highly sensitive children and the oldest has bore the brunt of my &quot;learning&quot;. She loves me of this I <br/>\n<br/>\nam sure just as I am equally sure that her anger and some of her intensity now is because she still carries the <br/>\n<br/>\nweight of abuse she received from my mistakes. She has taken my anger deep into her body and is likely <br/>\n<br/>\naware of it but just because she has forgiven me does not mean it did not abuse damage even lifelong work for <br/>\n<br/>\nher.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaureen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   On Monday, July 21, 2003, at 06:49 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rubyprincesstsg@...\">rubyprincesstsg@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Kids are very forgiving and I doubt a child would hold this against a <br/>\n  &gt; loving<br/>\n  &gt; mother who is learning to do things differently now.
