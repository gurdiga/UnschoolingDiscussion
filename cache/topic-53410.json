They might not know the names of the parts of speech, but they&#39;ll know how to use English properly if they&#39;ve heard it and read it used properly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they like MadLibs, that is a great way to introduce grammar but really...(and this is from my mom the English professor)...you do not need to teach grammar except where they are lacking in its actual use (like the rules for commas for example).<br/>\n<br/>\nMath:<br/>\n<br/>\nMath is all around you and I wouldn&#39;t push math in the traditional way.  I learned this the HARD way.  I *wanted* to unschool but math held me back.  I *wanted* to believe he&#39;d pick it up on his own but sheesh...he was almost 13!  I worried myself sick.  I needn&#39;t have ever worried.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess what.  I laid off for a year.  This year, HE decided (at 14) that he would work through a math book.  And guess what else:  He is plowing through it as though it was the most natural thing in the world:  this after YEARS of struggling, pushing, tantrums and tears.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if he had never wanted to pick up a math book?  Well, I can see now that he really didn&#39;t even need to.  He is going through one now so he is familiar with it because he wants to go back to school next year....but the fact is, he isn&#39;t *learning* from the book.  He is *verifying* what he has already learned from life!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting:  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids chat, email, and use LOTS of INstant messaging.  They can communicate.  All these things make spelling (and typing) important. I never taught them to type but they can &quot;hunt and peck&quot; as fast as I can type in the traditional way...and I type upwards of 78wpm.  I&#39;ve decided that the &quot;home row&quot; isn&#39;t all that important.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for content, let them tell you all about the things that are important to *them*.  write it down while they talk and show it to them.  Someday, they will want to write it themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: cellulargizzmos &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cellulargizzmos@...\">cellulargizzmos@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, January 06, 2003 7:12 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] New here, and new unschooler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I thought I would introduce myself.
