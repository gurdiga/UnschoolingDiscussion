I think time has been the main thing<br/>\n&gt; that has developed his personal convictions about hsing.  Over the years, we<br/>\n&gt; have seen drastic differences in our kids and the children we know who are in<br/>\n&gt; the school systems.  Some of them seem to do fine but the majority have had<br/>\n&gt; some serious problems.  Also, my parents, who are retired, began working part<br/>\n&gt; time during the school year as noon duty aids to supplement their income.<br/>\n&gt; They work in a VERY affluent school district yet we are horrified by what we<br/>\n&gt; hear from them.  Some of it concerns the way kids treat other kids (some of<br/>\n&gt; the popular kids making fun of and trying to degrade some of the special ed<br/>\n&gt; kids) and some of it concerns the way the school treats the kids (school<br/>\n&gt; people who humiliate kids in attempts to control them).<br/>\n&gt;      Recently we are involved in a very serious problem concerning my nephew.<br/>\n&gt;  Last July, a teacher had him stay through lunch for a test and told him she<br/>\n&gt; would give him a pass to get lunch afterward in the cafeteria.  When he went<br/>\n&gt; to the cafeteria with the pass, the cafeteria worker told him it was too<br/>\n&gt; late, that they were closed.  He argued with her and she responded angrily.<br/>\n&gt; Then he made the very foolish mistake of gesturing with his finger across his<br/>\n&gt; throat and said (according to her; his story varies), &quot;My mom&#39;s gonna get<br/>\n&gt; you.&quot;  They called the police.  We helped his parents get him enrolled in an<br/>\n&gt; independent study private school and he has stayed with us (we live 3 hrs<br/>\n&gt; away) for part of the time since then.  The school still held a meeting,<br/>\n&gt; expelled him, and now he is being charged with threatening a school official,<br/>\n&gt; which is a felony.  He is 13 years old, has a speech impediment and a<br/>\n&gt; weakness on the right side of his body from some complications when he was<br/>\n&gt; born.  His public defender says to be prepared that the judge may give him<br/>\n&gt; 120 days in a youth camp.  We, he, his parents, and his other family members<br/>\n&gt; are really afraid for him.  I don&#39;t know how he will survive in there or<br/>\n&gt; whether he will come out of it much worse.  This is a first offense for him.<br/>\n&gt;      This town is much worse than others that I know of (it&#39;s Lancaster, CA)<br/>\n&gt; and is doing many things that I feel are a violation of people&#39;s rights.  But<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t trust any school completely.  My husband now agrees with me<br/>\n&gt; completely that we would never subject our children to the arbitrary<br/>\n&gt; authority of people who work for the schools.  I&#39;m sorry this post has gotten<br/>\n&gt; so long but this thing with my nephew is really on my mind right now.<br/>\n&gt;     Anyway, to those who have reluctant dhs, just do what you know is right,<br/>\n&gt; share all the info you can with them, and let time begin to show them how<br/>\n&gt; much healthier and happier your children are hsing.

The fear of making boys &quot;mama&#39;s boys&quot; is a real confusion. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    Wow! I&#39;m thrilled to have a guy answer and so honestly. I have been <br/>\nraising and living with all men (my dh and 6 sons) for over 20 yrs and still <br/>\nhave a hard time understanding them. I believe I do well though. I understand <br/>\nso much more than I ever did. I know that my spending time with my boys is <br/>\nnot going to effect them the way my dh may think. For one thing I have some <br/>\nof the most stubborn, very male kids that I have ever come across. I am the <br/>\nminority here and boy do I know it!

It depends on how badly your children were hurt by<br/>\nbeing in the system, by how much they have to heal. It depends a bit on<br/>\ntheir learning style.  A hands on doer is going to give you more to feel<br/>\ncomfortable with compared to a quiet, reflective thinker.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh&#39;s usually come along, but it takes a while.  That too depends on his own<br/>\nschool experience, his own expectations and fears.  Dh&#39;s usually take the<br/>\nlongest to come around.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe very best piece of advice is to just DO.  Start your own projects, go<br/>\nplaces, go to the moves, see a play, keep yourself so busy with real life<br/>\nthat you do not sit and think about *school work*.  As time goes on  you<br/>\nwill see how the children are learning, even without anyone telling them<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, many times I&#39;ve heard people say, but they won&#39;t EVER do math if I<br/>\ndon&#39;t make them.  I finally figured out that that is probably true.  No<br/>\nself-respecting 12 year boy is going wake up one morning and say, &quot;I want to<br/>\ndo every odd problem of chapter 6 of a math text&quot;.   (Okay, I have a friend<br/>\nwho has a son who chooses to do math problems, but Ricky&#39;s, well Ricky...;))<br/>\nAnyway, another good thing for you to do is to sit down with a bunch of<br/>\ntext, look at how they try to bring real life into those text. The math<br/>\nproblems are about going to the store with $5 and needing to buy one of<br/>\nthese and 2 of those.  So, GO to the store and actually buy one of these and<br/>\ntwo of those and count your change. You&#39;ve just done a math problem and<br/>\ntaken care of an errand.
