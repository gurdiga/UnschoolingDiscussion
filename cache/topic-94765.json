And the focal point&quot; sink&quot; retains that beautiful<br/>\nwet look rather than the rocks you wonder why you brought home once they dry<br/>\nout..&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I have some additional suggestions. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are not particularly worried about how long the finish lasts - if you<br/>\nare using Mod Podge for instance - you can probably save a ton money by<br/>\nusing (only) a couple of layers of Future Floor Wax from the supermarket - a<br/>\nsecret weapon of theater set and prop builders. It is water based, quick<br/>\ndrying, increasingly glossy and actually much longer lasting than you would<br/>\nthink. It can be tinted with paint tints for faux paint effects, which will<br/>\nthen settle to the bottom of your container and allow you to pour off the<br/>\nnewly clean Future for future use! It can go over basically any surface,<br/>\nincluding crafts projects.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a certain industrial look in your decorating, Future really looks nice<br/>\nover unfinished concrete or cement floors or countertops, giving a nice<br/>\npatina.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the time, when I was still designing in Australia, when I have<br/>\nneeded to seal a painted floor and enhance the depth of color and texture,<br/>\nagain for sets, I have used Acrylic Emulsion which I purchased from another<br/>\ntheater in bulk. They bought a 44 gallon drum annually, and I would buy 5<br/>\ngallons at a time and it would last for a whole season on our little stage.<br/>\nAcrylic Emulsion is one of the key ingredients in white craft glues - it is<br/>\nwhite, less viscous than glue, and then dries clear. It is goes on with a<br/>\nroller or brush - beware of too much rolling over or you get tiny air<br/>\nbubbles that are very faintly milky when dry (but it takes a serious effort<br/>\nto do that). It would dry overnight and be a satin finish. It stood up to at<br/>\nleast 8 weeks plus classes. I never had to refinish a set, and it took the<br/>\nnext layer of paint beautifully.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother floor that is really durable is non-skid garage flooring - it has<br/>\nthe little raised circles, and I think rolls out just like vinyls. <br/>\n<br/>\nThinking about wall painters and renters and refinishing woes - a product<br/>\nthat is used in low budget filmmaking a lot, is Sand Blast masking paper -<br/>\nthat comes in 50 yard rolls. It has a good sticky surface, stronger than say<br/>\nContact Paper, yet will still peel off walls or formica or that cheap white<br/>\ncoated furniture. The outside is a somewhat absorbent brown paper - like<br/>\ngrocery bags but thicker and more durable. It takes paint really well,<br/>\nincluding standing up to faux finishing - hence its popularity in films when<br/>\nworking at locations that cannot be damaged in any way. I bet if you can<br/>\nfind a sand blaster - ie someone doing decorative glass sandblasting, not<br/>\ncleaning stone buildings - they may sell some. <br/>\nRobyn L.
