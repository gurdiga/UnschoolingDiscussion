I<br/>\nremember finally saying &quot;they can have this then&quot; and being sent to the<br/>\nkitchen to finish eating standing up at the counter. I also remember<br/>\ncontinuing to *think* &quot;send them this&quot; with resentment ever after when my<br/>\nmother came out with her phrase. I guess she heard it when she was young. We<br/>\nwere both very overweight as pre-teens, and shoveled our food in FAST.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was hardly a discussion of economics, and completely damaging to our<br/>\nalready damaged relationship. At the time we lived in a place where hungry<br/>\nand desperately poor hordes seemed all around us - Hong Kong in the 1960&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother was born in 1934 - the height of the Depression - with &quot;Do not<br/>\nwaste&quot; anything being the mantra of her parents. My grandmother used to save<br/>\nevery leftover (from the pot - plates had to be cleaned remember!), wrapped<br/>\nin aluminum foil in the fridge, intending to have it with an egg the next<br/>\nday but rarely doing so. There were always numerous unidentified packages in<br/>\nthere that eventually had to be tossed. Yet they had no compost heap in<br/>\ntheir garden, as I now recall. Only leaves and grass clippings were used as<br/>\nmulch. <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember being either hungry - no snacks - and looking longingly at the<br/>\ncolor pages of cookbooks, or feeling over-stuffed. I remember white linen<br/>\ntable cloths and napkins in each person&#39;s silver napkin ring engraved with<br/>\nour names sitting in a basket on the table. Mine was small with etched<br/>\ndiamond shapes, my grandparents were wider oval shapes. Nan had a spare set<br/>\nthat were bamboo with some asian carving on them that might have been sent<br/>\nfrom Hong Kong, and were used for guests.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

The statistics say<br/>\nthings like most of the world lives on less than $2 a day, so we decided to<br/>\nfigure out how much money we live on per day, and our budget developed out<br/>\nof this.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, we figured out our major expenses on an excel spreadsheet that I<br/>\nuse to track our monthly household expenses.  We just used the big<br/>\ncategories like mortgage, car (insurance and gas), groceries, utilities and<br/>\nsavings. We took the percentage of our entire household income that goes<br/>\ntowards each category, say 13% or 5%, whatever. Once we figured out that<br/>\npercentage, the kids chose a dollar amount that they wanted as their monthly<br/>\nincome--we settled on $40 a month per child. I wanted something big enough<br/>\nthat they actually had a sense of what it was like to take care of monthly<br/>\nexpenses--what I do each month to keep the household running. The kids pay<br/>\nout the same percentage from their monthly income that I do for each<br/>\ncategory, and whatever is left over is theirs to spend.  So, for instance,<br/>\nif our mortgage is 13% of our total household income, then the kids would<br/>\ntake 13% of their $40 to put in the mortgage envelope.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe chose to do it this way because this is how we deal with money, and we<br/>\nwanted our kids to see and understand that. A certain amount comes in; a<br/>\ncertain amount goes out. We try to put a percentage into savings each month,<br/>\nand the rest is mine or dh&#39;s or the kids&#39; to play with--clothes, toys,<br/>\nbooks, movies, whatever.  We don&#39;t tie the kids&#39; money to chores--it&#39;s just<br/>\ntheir income. In the same way that I don&#39;t have to do certain chores each<br/>\nmonth to get money from dh. I get money by being a member of the household<br/>\neven though I don&#39;t actively bring money into the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo weeks ago, the kids each opened a savings account, and the $5 that is<br/>\nbudgeted<br/>\nfor savings will go into their account instead of the household account<br/>\nwhere it used to go.<br/>\nThat way they&#39;ll get to see money accrue over time without have to take it<br/>\nout of the $6.60<br/>\nthey get each month, which isn&#39;t a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids actually like paying the bills each month, and I think it really<br/>\ngives them a clear sense of where the money goes. Even though they&#39;re young,<br/>\nthey understand that we have to pay for water and electricity and insurance<br/>\nin the same way that we pay for groceries and toys. Doing the budget this<br/>\nway takes the hidden expenses of a household and makes them real and<br/>\nvisible. The kids are very understanding when I pay bills twice each month,<br/>\nand they&#39;re happy to give me the 15 or 20 minutes that it takes to get it<br/>\ndone because they know it&#39;s important. They also seem to understand more<br/>\nclearly when I say that we can&#39;t afford to do something or buy something<br/>\nbecause they *know* where our money is actually going. The older two,<br/>\nanyway, get that there&#39;s only a limited amount of money coming in each month<br/>\nand that it has to go specific places before we can spend any. I think the<br/>\nbiggest<br/>\nthing is transparency--letting the kids see the money coming in and going<br/>\nout and all<br/>\nthe things we do to keep track of it. The kids see me not only paying bills,<br/>\nbut entering<br/>\nour receipts into an excel spreadsheet every month, keeping track of what<br/>\nwe&#39;ve spent<br/>\nand where it&#39;s gone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Ok, frustrated here","postDate":"1087714062","msgId":95864,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBRTJDNzY2LUMyODUtMTFEOC04M0EwLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNiMzJmcytiNzdzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNiMzJmcytiNzdzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":95862,"nextInTopic":95865,"prevInTime":95863,"nextInTime":95865,"topicId":95840,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My children are also aware if <br/>\nthis practice, and know that they can probably wait a little longer for certain <br/>\nitems that will eventually be clearanced.  It&#39;s fun to watch their sense of <br/>\naccomplishment when they get a bargain. <br/>\nWe do not pay them for regular household chores, because they are part of <br/>\ntheir family responsibility. I keep a list of extra work around the house that <br/>\nthey can get paid for.  They also make their own money with a variety of <br/>\ndifferent jobs. My oldest daughter baby-sits, and will be starting a new job soon. <br/>\nShe&#39;s also great at recycling clothes, and making new creations out of them.<br/>\n My son collects golf balls from the golf course and resells them to the <br/>\ngolfers, does some pet sitting, and helps some of our elderly neighbors with heavy <br/>\nchores. <br/>\nMy youngest daughter is still learning, and can be a bit needy at times, but <br/>\nI have confidence that she will catch on too. <br/>\nEven when finances are not so tight, I like for them to learn to save the <br/>\nsurplus and invest it for the future. <br/>\nI have also heard the argument that our family and home aren&#39;t good enough <br/>\nfor my oldest dd. When it&#39;s just me, I would let it roll off of my back, and <br/>\ndon&#39;t take it personally. If the younger ones are around to overhear it, then we <br/>\nwill all sit down and discuss it, so that everyone has a chance to voice their <br/>\nown opinion. It was more common when she was in school, and the fact that we <br/>\nlive in an upscale neighborhood didn&#39;t help. She has since grown and matured, <br/>\nand has learned that life is so much more than make-up, hair, and material <br/>\nthings. <br/>\n<br/>\nElaine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 6/18/2004 8:20:22 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:litlrooh@...\">litlrooh@...</a> writes:<br/>\nI have not &quot;required&quot; chores from my kids for a long time, but I do ask for <br/>\nhelp when I need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs of late, my 12 year old is constantly asking me to run here everywhere, <br/>\nasking to have friends over, wanting me to buy her hair dye, wanting her hair <br/>\ncut, asking me to pay for makeup, asking me for money at the pool, at swim <br/>\nmeets, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer requests seem to come several times a day, 10 requests in a day would not <br/>\nbe an exagerration. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe really does not seem aware of how much she asks for.

It was exhausting! I was surprised every <br/>\ntime my daughter (13) asked to go out and needed a ride. I&#39;d take her somewhere feeling <br/>\nso good about helping her out and think (wrongly) that that would &quot;hold&quot; her for a few <br/>\ndays at least. Wrong. The next morning, another request.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a month of daily rides and negotiations, I was becoming resentful instead of happy <br/>\nto help her. And she was so totally unconscious of the impact of this driving on the other <br/>\nkids or my ability to keep up with other demands in the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally took a two week break. I told her that it was summer and that while I love that <br/>\nshe&#39;s going out with friends so much, I needed to have a driving vacation where I could be <br/>\nhome with the other kids without the pressure of taking and picking up all the time (some <br/>\nof these escapades would turn into driving to one place, picking up and taking to another <br/>\nand then later picking up to bring home).<br/>\n<br/>\nI told her that she could arrange any rides she wanted or she could have the &quot;gang&quot; to our <br/>\nhouse, but I just needed a two week break.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe wasn&#39;t too happy at the time, but she did amazingly start finding other rides. And for <br/>\nthe first time, she invited this group of teens to our house (she had them over twice I think <br/>\nand that snowballed into other times).<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter those two weeks, I actually felt better about making a true evaluation of each <br/>\nrequest. I had forgotten that just because I am home doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m available. If I plan <br/>\nto have a day at home with the younger kids, I can tell her that I&#39;m not available for driving <br/>\nthat day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still drove her lots last summer, but I felt much more freedom to make decisions that <br/>\ninvolved me as well as her. We got more creative about where she went and how often and <br/>\nwith whom.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; She really does not seem aware of how much she asks for.  And she constantly <br/>\n </span></blockquote>complains like our family and our home are not good enough for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was true in our family too. We have Father&#39;s Day coming up and we are planning a big <br/>\nbreakfast for him. Her only thought is will it interferre with seeing her friends who will be <br/>\nat her church that day...<br/>\n<br/>\nI do understand how consuming friends are at this age. What I had forgotten is that they <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to consume me too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Although I have asked if she could help me out (and in a nice way) she continually says <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;no, she doesn&#39;t feel like it&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one thing I did find. I would say, &quot;I can drive you at 6:00 if I get the dishes cleaned <br/>\nup and the living room straightened before then. If you&#39;d like to help me, great. If not, <br/>\nthat&#39;s fine, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be done in time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I would do it as I could. If she saw 6 approaching and I still hadn&#39;t gotten done what I <br/>\nhad planned, she was more likely to get in gear and help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t threatening. The cleaning or other task has to be legitimate. But I think she had <br/>\nstopped seeing that her life was impacted by her dirty dishes or messy couches (she leaves <br/>\nher notebooks and writing stuff everywhere).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once again, today, she said she would help out and do some stuff for me if.......<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now the time has come, she wants me to drive her to somewhere, and once again she <br/>\n </span></blockquote>has done absolutely NOTHING to help me out.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am feeling VERY taken advantage of and overwhelmed with the stuff that needs done in <br/>\n </span></blockquote>between running her everywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are being taken advantage of, but not consciously.

I&quot;m really inclined to say &quot;no&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just say &quot;no&quot; sometimes when you need to.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last little story.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew I was not taking care of me (had lost the sense of being a real person in her eyes) <br/>\nwhen one time I picked her up (after a very complicated driving scenario that involved <br/>\ndriving multiple kids multiple places) and she was appalled at my seventies rock station on <br/>\nthe radio. I explained that she was free to change it now, but she wasn&#39;t in the car before <br/>\nand so I listened to what I wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer reply shocked me: &quot;But you shouldn&#39;t even listen to it then. It&#39;s a terrible station.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was the turning and breaking point for me. I didn&#39;t have enough gravitas in her life <br/>\nfor me to have my own radio station preferences when she wasn&#39;t around? I knew change <br/>\nwas in order.<br/>\n<br/>\nA year later (now) we are in a much better groove about driving - I&#39;m not resentful, she&#39;s <br/>\nmore careful about giving me notice and finding rides. She&#39;s been more helpful with the <br/>\nhouse. And she is more conscious of me as a person, not just a ride-giver.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd she still focuses primarily on friends over family. But there is peace and I do enjoy her <br/>\nnow again.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Ok, frustrated here","postDate":"1087641590","msgId":95846,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJDRjk5MDM2LjI4NEU2JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFhMC4yNWVlOTcyZC4yZTA1MjQ0YUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":95845,"nextInTopic":95847,"prevInTime":95845,"nextInTime":95847,"topicId":95840,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It isn&#39;t<br/>\nbecause you aren&#39;t strong enough! Kids aren&#39;t born with the desire to grasp<br/>\nwhatever they can con others into giving them until we train it out of them<br/>\nso if he is doing that, it&#39;s probably because there&#39;s something else he&#39;s<br/>\nneeding.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is very draining.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>People don&#39;t know they&#39;re draining us unless we let them know!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I feel like I have always been this<br/>\n&gt; easygoing person and that used to be a good thing.

So when kids ask for too much it seems the solution is to<br/>\nget them to stop asking. And then we feel frustrated when kids keep asking,<br/>\nas though they should just know that they&#39;re asking too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think honesty about what can be accomplished for *everyone* (including mom<br/>\nand the home) is a better solution. If a child needs something that might<br/>\ntake an hour trip instead of feeling guilty about saying no, we can let them<br/>\nknow how it fits into the day and whether it will need to be put on the plan<br/>\nfor the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we cast ourselves in the role of the granter and denier or wishes, then<br/>\nthe only tool we&#39;re giving kids to get their needs met is begging. If we let<br/>\nreality (time, money, energy) be the factor, then kids can be involved in<br/>\nthe process of figuring out how to meet their needs given the limitations<br/>\nthat life imposes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; feel comfortable being the kind of person I have to be to keep him from taking<br/>\n&gt; over.

I can&#39;t say I&#39;m good at running a home but<br/>\neven if she had asked, had assigned chores, I doubt I&#39;d be any better. I<br/>\nknow *how* to do housework. It&#39;s not that hard! ;-) I could set up a<br/>\nschedule. I could do Flylady. But there are things that are way more<br/>\ninteresting than housework.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there&#39;s something that could have been learned in the past to improve<br/>\nyourself today, it can be done now.

Here&#39;s a list of<br/>\nthings to do and how to do them and the standards expected of you. Pick<br/>\none.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what will make a child or anyone feel needed is working together to<br/>\naccomplish something. Also being honestly thankful for help given. If<br/>\nsomeone takes time away from doing something more meaningful to them to help<br/>\nus out, we should be suitably thankful for it. Generally what kids get is<br/>\nnothing for doing what&#39;s been assigned and attention for not doing it.

I could have spent years &quot;making&quot; her understand, but she<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have really understood until her brain chemistry changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if we can paint an honest picture of what&#39;s involved in running a<br/>\nhome we can help kids get a better feel for what&#39;s involved in what they&#39;re<br/>\nasking for, get a feeling of what needs sacrificed to get something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are no dishes and the kids get the feeling we could have done them<br/>\n(or bought paper plates last shopping trip ;-) it communicates more a sense<br/>\nof feeling that it rocks to have the one with power (who gets to decide who<br/>\ndoes what) and sucks to be the one with no power.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, I allow them to watch an hour of tv each day if they had done<br/>\n&gt; their job the day before.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What if your husband decided you couldn&#39;t watch TV the next day unless you<br/>\ncooked dinner from scratch the night before?

Sometimes I <br/>\nfeel like the minute he wakes up he is only thinking of ways to get anything <br/>\nhe can from me. It is very draining. I feel like I have always been this <br/>\neasygoing person and that used to be a good thing. Now I wish I was a strong <br/>\ncharacter and much more rigid. My son is smart and self confident. He is well liked <br/>\nby most people who know him. When he is with me, he drives me nuts. I don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel comfortable being the kind of person I have to be to keep him from taking <br/>\nover. I&#39;m not the kind of person who does everything by schedule and who is <br/>\norderly. I&#39;m more a roll with the punches kind of person. <br/>\n       Anyway, I guess I&#39;m saying that I understand what you are going <br/>\nthrough. It is not easy to do but you can&#39;t try to always keep her happy. I realized <br/>\nthat I was always worried that if he was not happy he would make everyone <br/>\nmiserable. I found my day being revolved around what he wanted to have or do. <br/>\nThen I would be angry with myself and him because all the things I knew needed to <br/>\nbe accomplished were not. I found myself not liking him and that really <br/>\nbothered me. <br/>\n       I think it is a good idea to give her a certain amount of money per <br/>\nmonth or week, but I don&#39;t think you should be too specific about what it is <br/>\nfor. What my son would do is instead of spending the money on other things, he <br/>\nwould keep asking for more money for other things not on the list and just say <br/>\nthat it needs to be added to the list. I&#39;m sure she is like many teens and they <br/>\nall want the latest clothes and hair, etc. You cannot compete with kids who&#39;s <br/>\nparents have an endless amount of money and just hand their kids all that <br/>\nthey ask for.  <br/>\n       Also, about the jobs, when I grew up my mother never asked us to do <br/>\nany jobs and she just tried to do everything herself. When I was on my own, I <br/>\nhad no idea what needed to be done to keep a house going. I still have trouble. <br/>\nHaving responsibility in the family to keep the house in order makes a child <br/>\nfeel needed. It gives them a sense of accomplishment. I just started to assign <br/>\njobs to my kids. I&#39;m working on how to &quot;encourage&#39; them to complete their jobs <br/>\neach day. I should have started when my son was younger, but late is better <br/>\nthen never. The hardest part is getting them to complete them. I try to make <br/>\nthem see that if they do not complete their job for the week, it effects the <br/>\nentire family. If the dishes are not done then we don&#39;t have any dishes to eat <br/>\noff of. Also, I allow them to watch an hour of tv each day if they had done <br/>\ntheir job the day before. I was just about to disconnect the cable because they <br/>\nwatch waaaaay too much tv and to save $. My son came up with an idea of tv for <br/>\njobs completed, so I said I&#39;d try it. So far it is not too bad. It is not <br/>\nperfect but better then before. The kids are contributing with the work and they <br/>\nare watching less tv.<br/>\n       Sometimes when we love our children we want to give them all they <br/>\nwant. We think it makes them happy. I&#39;m always telling my kids that they have no <br/>\nidea of all the things that they have and the things they do. I never had <br/>\nanything like that when I was a kid. Sort of like walking 3 miles to school without <br/>\nany shoes in the snow!! They just kind of laugh at me and ask for another <br/>\npiece of candy. I&#39;ve learned to not try to make them happy all the time. When my <br/>\n3 year old tells me that she doesn&#39;t like me I say &quot;that&#39;s OK, it&#39;s not my job <br/>\nto make you like me. I still love you, though. Now, go feed the dog!&quot;<br/>\n       Sorry this is so long. I got a little carried away. Hope things get a <br/>\nlittle easier for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Ok, frustrated here","postDate":"1087617001","msgId":95842,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJEQkYxMTdFLUMxQTMtMTFEOC05RUE5LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWM0NTU4YyRhMmI2ODZmMCQwMjAxYThjMEBhby5sb3AuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWM0NTU4YyRhMmI2ODZmMCQwMjAxYThjMEBhby5sb3AuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":95841,"nextInTopic":95843,"prevInTime":95841,"nextInTime":95843,"topicId":95840,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a suggestion resolving the asking to spend money issue.

This is <br/>\nover and above any other allowance you may have already been giving.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd she can spend it on whatever she wants. But the deal is that she <br/>\npays for the things on the list you made. If she asks you to buy her <br/>\nhair dye, you remind her that is on the list of things she&#39;s paying <br/>\nfor.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be surprised if she doesn&#39;t spend nearly as much on these things <br/>\nand uses the money for other things. That&#39;s okay - that&#39;s sensible <br/>\ndecision making when faced with real trade-offs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis worked so well for my family - I think otherwise the kids  don&#39;t <br/>\nhave a good sense of how much is reasonable to ask for and they might <br/>\nas well just keep asking for everything they could possibly want until <br/>\nwe have to say we can&#39;t afford it.

He is given $60 a month, of which $10 is put away for savings, and $10 is put away for a future large ticket item that may pop up.  So that leaves him with $40 for the month to purchase toys, video games, snacks and such.  We just started with this at the beginning of the month, but already I see a change.  He burned thru the money in the first 2 days.  I reminded him that when it was gone, he would have to wait till next month for more.  He did not want to save any, so it is all gone.  The first day, he wanted a snack when we were out.  He had just eaten lunch, so it was not that he was starving.  I told him that he was more than welcome to purchase anything he wanted with his money.  He informed me that he would rather wait till we got home, which was after we were don&#39;t at that store, because the food at home was free.  Smart kid!!  Also, when we are out and he asks for a toy, I tell him<br/>\n that he can buy it with his allowance.  He says it is all gone, and will have to wait till he gets it again.  And that is usually the end of it.  Now I must say that he has always been a pretty easy going child, and the discussions for me to purchase a toy were never a battle, but now I am no longer the BAD GUY for not buying it.  He owns the decision on what to get with his money.  Of course, I still do get him things when we are out, but he is learning that when the money is gone, it is gone.  So when I tell him I do not have any money to get what he wants, he understands the concept much better now. <br/>\n <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Have a Nice Day!&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:litlrooh@...\">litlrooh@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; As of late, my 12 year old is constantly asking me to run here everywhere,<br/>\nasking to have friends over, wanting me to buy her hair dye, wanting her<br/>\nhair cut, asking me to pay for makeup, asking me for money at the pool, at<br/>\nswim meets, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
