I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s because kids have a better sense of what is <br/>\nreality and what is fantasy than adults, but that&#39;s very true. Kids know <br/>\nwhat is real and what isn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps, he said, kids and adults &quot;are reading different genres. Kids are <br/>\nreading a book about someone like them who is going up against something <br/>\nscary and triumphing. Adults are reading a book about a child in danger. A <br/>\nchild in danger is a different kind of story; it particularly troubles <br/>\nadults. But I think it&#39;s very good for kids to be told that the world is <br/>\nnot always a safe and hospitable place.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92760,"nextTopicId":92782}}
