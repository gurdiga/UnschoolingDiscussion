They had gotten <br/>\nout the art supplies and were making crafts with construction paper. <br/>\nMy youngest,3 1/2, was making a barbie bed according to her using the <br/>\nconstruction paper. Now my other two were were making something too <br/>\nbut I decided I wasn&#39;t going to get mad over it. They had taken <br/>\nconstruction paper, cut out a house, grass, sun, and cloud and used a <br/>\nglue stick to glue the cut outs onto the living room window. I asked <br/>\nthem why they made the picture on the window instead of using paper <br/>\nand my oldest,7, said cause the window was boring. I have to give her <br/>\nthat one since the view from our window is a giant wall from the <br/>\nbuilding across the street. I took a picture of the picture they made <br/>\nand said &quot;here, let&#39;s put the cut outs on paper before the glue dries <br/>\nand this way we can save the picture.&quot; I was also impressed to see <br/>\nwhat my daughter used for glitter on the house. We use rock salt and <br/>\nhave a salt grinder, so she put glue on the house where she wanted <br/>\nglitter and sprinkled salt over it. I wouldn&#39;t have thought to use <br/>\nsalt for glitter. I just had to say the nice creative moment we had in <br/>\nour house yesturday.<br/>\nElaina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105538,"nextTopicId":105541}}
