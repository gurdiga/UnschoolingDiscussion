He&#39;s looking forward to starting scouts this fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut friends is different than socializing, remember.  Tim socializes with<br/>\nlots of people.  We chat with storekeepers who speak English (I&#39;m in<br/>\nGermany), people in line, on trains, etc.  Volunteering is good, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that 10a.m. was the best time to hit the library or bookstores if<br/>\nyou&#39;re looking for other homeschoolers.  It&#39;s before nap time for the<br/>\ntoddlers, but after morning rush.  Obviously it&#39;s summer right now, but<br/>\nmaybe in the fall you&#39;ll run into some folks who could be friendly without a<br/>\nstatement of faith!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, I can tell you that my son is a loner.  He likes other kids and<br/>\nsocializes just fine, but he prefers the company of the bugs and birds.<br/>\nUnless you have a child who&#39;s begging for more friends, it&#39;s possible she&#39;s<br/>\nhappy in your current situation!<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I have a huge question for the group which I&#39;m sure is asked by every newbie.<br/>\n&gt; How will my daughter socialize with other kids?  It seems the common answer is<br/>\n&gt; through homeschool groups.  Well, as I posted earlier, I live basically in the<br/>\n&gt; middle of nowhere on a dead end road in southern Oklahoma.  The closest town<br/>\n&gt; of 25,000 has one homeschool group & they require a Faith statement.  But more<br/>\n&gt; than that, I know several people in it - they are very fundamental Christians<br/>\n&gt; which is their choice and I respect that.  But every time I get near them,<br/>\n&gt; they try to convert me.  I don&#39;t want that for my daughter.  Also, my daughter<br/>\n&gt; is an only child, so she won&#39;t learn with brothers/sisters.  I am VERY<br/>\n&gt; concerned about sending her to public school - but I don&#39;t want to isolate<br/>\n&gt; her, either.  It&#39;s bad enough that, although we attend the most liberal church<br/>\n&gt; in the area, I spend every sunday &quot;de-programming&quot; her from Sunday School.  On<br/>\n&gt; the plus side, she is learning at a very young age to question the facts we<br/>\n&gt; are spoon fed.  I would love to hear from other homeschoolers of only<br/>\n&gt; children?!?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cat </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39592,"nextTopicId":39594}}
