Who wouldn&#39;t be &quot;needy&quot; with all<br/>\nthat you have on your plate right now?  I&#39;d like to offer some support<br/>\nif I may.  Have absolutely NO FEAR about your 7 year old not reading. <br/>\nMy 8 year old is only just beginning the basics and I have at least 3<br/>\nother homeschooler friends with kids who are taking their sweet time at<br/>\nthe reading trick too (one boy is 10 and can barely read a word but he<br/>\nis nonetheless an alert, aware, interested-in-learning child and is<br/>\ndoing well).  It will come, I can assure you!  I just read something<br/>\nrecently about the ideal age for reading being 11 years!  So you&#39;ve got<br/>\na way to go...I&#39;d think one of the best possible homeschooling<br/>\nexperiences for a family would be what you&#39;ve just been through and will<br/>\ncontinue with over the next year or so.  What a phenomenal opportunity<br/>\nfor your children to have shared in your pregnancy, the fetal<br/>\ndevelopment and now study of the newly arrived infant!  When my then 9<br/>\nand 6 year old children immersed themselves in my last pregnancy, (my<br/>\nbaby turns 2 tomorrow...) the euphoria lasted to this day.  We got every<br/>\nbook and video the library had on pregnancy, fetal development and<br/>\nbirth.  My children have become completely engrossed and amazed with the<br/>\ngrowth and moulding of a fellow human being.  What they would&#39;ve missed<br/>\nhad they been away all of every day at a public school is enough to<br/>\ndepress anyone.  What an amazing opportunity your family has right now! <br/>\nAnd if your 10 year old would rather read Harry Potter all day I&#39;m sure<br/>\nthe day will come when inevitably he will grow tired of it and be ready<br/>\nfor something new.  &quot;Don&#39;t sweat the small stuff&quot; and just enjoy the<br/>\nrare and precious moments with the newborn and the unification of your 4<br/>\nchildren into a new family dynamic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your ten year old is looking for penpals, I&#39;m sure my now 11 year old<br/>\nson would be most pleased to reciprocate!<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations again and my very best wishes,<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia in Saskatoon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nuebinger robyn wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      Hello to everyone out there.
