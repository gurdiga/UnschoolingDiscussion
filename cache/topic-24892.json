I truly believe that hundreds of<br/>\nyears from now the surviving literature will be Harry Potter books, Tom<br/>\nClancy, Steven King, Danielle Steele, James Patterson, etc.  We have this<br/>\nhoity toity attitude about popular fiction - that it is somehow less<br/>\nworthy but in the long run what will survive is what got printed the<br/>\nmost.
