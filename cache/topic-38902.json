I didn&#39;t <br/>\n  mention earlier that I am also a musician and perform and rehearse <br/>\n  (hopefully) frequently.  My son can be more present for that, though, but <br/>\n  he doesn&#39;t really care to be.  I can remember a couple of years ago <br/>\n  performing at a benefit for a womens&#39; and childrens&#39; shelter on this huge <br/>\n  stage, and Liam was playing with toy on the stage that he would roll over <br/>\n  to me and I would stop with my foot and pass back to him while we were <br/>\n  performing.  The other folks in the band didn&#39;t mind this at all (one of <br/>\n  them, in fact, was my husband), and they agreed that anytime Liam wanted to <br/>\n  be with us during a performance, we would be more than glad to have him be <br/>\n  there.  But, again, I am not completely available to him during these <br/>\n  times.  It&#39;s way better, though, than being completely unavailable!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I knew when he was born that it was important for Liam to see us, his <br/>\n  parents, pursuing our dreams and goals, even if they were not in sync with <br/>\n  societal norms.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, it is a big relief to read a message from someone else who is <br/>\n  struggling with the same stuff as me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Warmly,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Marji<br/>\n<br/>\n  P.S.  This unschooling group is the single biggest boon to me!  Thanks to <br/>\n  everyone for your excellent questions and your excellent answers.  I wish <br/>\n  we all lived close together so we could argue and discuss and have fun in <br/>\n  person!

 right?<br/>\n<br/>\ni, too, am totally unavailable to my son when i am working.  one of my jobs sounds very similar to yours in terms of intensity and intellectual involvement.  i&#39;m a freelance indexer - i write indexes for the back of books, usually for university presses, so they&#39;re very scholarly, and demand total concentration.  i&#39;ve been doing this for 12 years, and like you, used to do it in the early morning hours, and in spare moments while the kids happily played.  but now that i&#39;m a single mom, i need to do it whenever i can whenever i have the work....<br/>\n<br/>\nmy other business at home is massage therapy.  and of course, when i&#39;m with a client, not only am i NOT with my kids, they must be in their (separate) rooms quiet as mice.  not really a bad thing, except for the unavailability of the mom part.<br/>\n<br/>\noh yeah, and then when i don&#39;t have a job, i really SHOULD be spending time marketing myself!  argghhhh!  and then...i&#39;m also learning to teach yoga, something i&#39;ve been practicing for over 10 years, and need to steal time for everyday.<br/>\n<br/>\nand i agree - it&#39;s great for them to be independent.  i&#39;ve always gotten many compliments about how creative and happily independent my kids are.  <br/>\n<br/>\nbut i still struggle with how much time i DON&#39;T spend with them, and i also struggle with feeling guilty about ANY time that i take for myself, for yoga.  i don&#39;t have much &quot;down&quot; time, except my yoga time, and some gardening...and sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nand like you, we live as inexpensively as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nand like you, my younger son WAS in school...during the transition from marriage to single, before i was able to work so much at home.  and i saw how destructive it was to him.  so i&#39;ve traded the quiet space to work (along with the stress of rushing him to school and the intensely horrible stress of making sure that he did the required and usually totally inane homework assignments) for having my sweet boy home all day long with me often ignoring him.<br/>\n<br/>\ni literally couldn&#39;t HOMEschool.  it&#39;s a good thing that UNschooling has always fitted into my philosophy.  (i unschooled my older son till the middle of 6th grade when i left my ex.)<br/>\n<br/>\nand i, too, i my darker moments feel that i was a fool to think i could ever be a good mother at all, let alone a homeschooling mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for letting me vent and complain!  and thank you so much for sharing your feelings.  i&#39;m sure that some of the other unschooling moms -even if they are home all day - feel that they don&#39;t DO enough, or that they aren&#39;t available enough, or that they must split their attention between so many other demands (or even several children).<br/>\n<br/>\nultimately, i think we can only do the best that we can do in any given situation.  and the lessons of patience and time management that i&#39;ve learned thru all this have been invaluable.  if kids are learning all the time, they are learning thru HOW gracefully and lovingly we handle our time limitations with them, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nlooking forward to hearing more on this from you and others.<br/>\n<br/>\njulie<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: marji <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, July 03, 2002 7:13 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] single mom with 2 home businesses<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi, Julie.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I TOTALLY know what you mean!  (Warning:  This is a long message!)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I also work from home.  I have one son only.  I&#39;m not a single mom, but my <br/>\n  husband works during the day outside the home and teaches privately here, <br/>\n  so he&#39;s not all that available during the week.  The kind of work I do <br/>\n  (medical transcription) demands all my attention when I&#39;m doing it.  For a <br/>\n  while there I was able to work in the very early morning hours and very <br/>\n  late evening hours, keeping a lot of my day open for my son.  But, the <br/>\n  availability of work has changed recently, and I have to work almost all <br/>\n  day to get the kind of work I need to make ends meet.  The fact is that I <br/>\n  don&#39;t feel I&#39;m providing opportunities for a very interesting life for Liam <br/>\n  in this context.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The great love of his life is watching Power Rangers movies and then <br/>\n  creating his own Power Rangers episodes alone or with his friends in their <br/>\n  play.  He also loves hiking and camping and we try to do that whenever we <br/>\n  can.  And, he loves pottery and we do that a couple of times a week.  Other <br/>\n  than that, he plays computer games from time to time, we work in our <br/>\n  garden, and we now swim in our newly rehabilitated-from-a-frog-pond <br/>\n  swimming pool (catching and releasing the tadpoles and frogs was tremendous <br/>\n  fun and a beautiful way to learn about these little guys).  He gets urges <br/>\n  to do things like playing with water in the sink or bathtub or <br/>\n  experimenting with mixing paint colors and other kinds of various <br/>\n  experiments, like what happens when you take mom&#39;s patchouli oil and mix it <br/>\n  with...?  He is now slowly beginning to recognize words (I turned on the <br/>\n  closed captioning in our VCR/TV combo, and he is actually beginning to <br/>\n  learn to read that way!).  He plays with the Cuisenaire rods in ways that <br/>\n  are entirely his own.  At more than 7-1/2 years of age, he has just now <br/>\n  developed a wiggly lower tooth.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I took Liam out of a Montessori school in February because he totally hated <br/>\n  it.  He was in the &quot;first grade,&quot;  and didn&#39;t like having to do activities <br/>\n  that were totally meaningless to him.  He may have benefited from these <br/>\n  activities in a small, forgettable way, but most of the stuff he had to do <br/>\n  was stupid as far as he was concerned.  I volunteered there several days a <br/>\n  week, and I saw what he meant.  Anytime he would try to do something that <br/>\n  MEANT something to him, he was called on the carpet for not doing the <br/>\n  &quot;work&quot; on his &quot;goal sheet&quot; (not HIS goals, mind you, but goals somebody <br/>\n  else had established for him!).  Pulling him from there was absolutely the <br/>\n  right thing to do, and I will never regret that move.  I just regret that <br/>\n  he didn&#39;t have a better mom to come home to!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Truth be told, I feel like an early failure as an unschooling mom because I <br/>\n  am so unavailable to him much of the time.  It&#39;s not that I feel the need <br/>\n  to &quot;teach&quot; him stuff.  it&#39;s just that we don&#39;t get to do too many <br/>\n  interesting things or go too many places because I have to work.  I think <br/>\n  he is bored.  I would be, too.  I&#39;m not in any kind of position to blow off <br/>\n  work because my income is so essential.  Even though we are really <br/>\n  frugal--two old cars, no car payments, low insurance, small house, little <br/>\n  utility bills, shopping only at thrift stores, etc.--making ends meet is a <br/>\n  real challenge for us.  Our only extravagance is that we are scrupulous <br/>\n  about eating organic, but I run a food coop to help with that expense and <br/>\n  we have a large garden.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Every time I write an email about this subject, I get appalled at the <br/>\n  length and breadth of the message, and then I don&#39;t send it.  I confess <br/>\n  that I feel shame about this issue, and I wish I could find a <br/>\n  solution.  There is no one in the world I would rather be with than Liam; <br/>\n  he is delightful, compassionate, witty, loving and sweet, and of course, he <br/>\n  is my son!  Even if he had none of those excellent qualities, I would crave <br/>\n  to be with him. I feel blessed to be with him, yet I feel in my darker <br/>\n  moments that I was a fool for thinking I could be a mom at all, let alone <br/>\n  an unschooling mom.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wish I could offer words of encouragement to you, Julie.  The one thing I <br/>\n  can say is that knowing what we know about the alternatives, our kids are <br/>\n  dramatically better off unschooling, and we are doing the very best we can!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Best wishes,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Marji in Orange County NY (who wishes she could find other unschoolers <br/>\n  close by)<br/>\n<br/>\n  At 21:53 7/2/02 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;i&#39;m just wondering if there&#39;s anyone else out there who fears that they <br/>\n  &gt;don&#39;t have the TIME to UNschool with their kids.  i&#39;m a single mom, trying <br/>\n  &gt;to make two home businesses work.  sometimes i feel i just don&#39;t have time <br/>\n  &gt;to even read to my son; yet i&#39;m still making the decision to pull him out <br/>\n  &gt;of school because i feel that being home with an often too busy mom has <br/>\n  &gt;got to be better than being told what to do and how to do it all day long <br/>\n  &gt;in school.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;thank goodness i don&#39;t feel the need to actually TEACH my son, but i still <br/>\n  &gt;worry that i am not available enough for him.  does anyone else struggle <br/>\n  &gt;with this?<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;thanks,<br/>\n  &gt;julie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you have questions, concerns or problems with this list, please email the Moderator, Joyce Fetteroll, at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
