It doesn&#39;t specifically mention any early <br/>\nBriton reading silently, but there are LOTS of clues to why that would be <br/>\nremarkable and worth writing home about!<br/>\n<br/>\nMAYBE, if English has long been a read-silently language, then it&#39;s a <br/>\ndistinct and important advantage that we have all those weird spellings, because we <br/>\nwill read the words as themselves instead of worrying about their <br/>\npronunciations.   IF that is true (and I&#39;m just throwing an early guess that I never ever <br/>\nconsidered before yesterday), then it&#39;s an advantage that we have too, to and <br/>\ntwo  and similar oddities.   If English were made more phonetic, reading <br/>\nsilently might be more difficult.  And reading aloud &quot;cold&quot; might be more difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing some people were discussing on the side at the conference in <br/>\nChicago was the idea of what &quot;reading&quot; is.   If &quot;reading&quot; were *ONLY* causing <br/>\nsounds to come out into the air again (phonetic read-aloud) then I myself could <br/>\nread French and Spanish, no problem.   I could read aloud pretty well (I&#39;d <br/>\nbotch some verb tenses in Spanish, no doubt).  Problem is, I would only the <br/>\nslightest idea what I was reading.  I know all the phonetic rules for reading <br/>\nSpanish and French, but I&#39;m competent in neither.  So the answer to whether I would <br/>\nbe reading (as opposed to &quot;sounding out&quot;) can help me think about what I <br/>\nthink &quot;reading&quot; really is in young native-English-speaking &quot;readers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] reading with or without &quot;words&quot; (was a question about formal writing & unschooling","postDate":"1095403546","msgId":99668,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM0ODc0MDNBLTA4NzUtMTFEOS05NUNGLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0NS4zM2VhNmE3NC4yZTdhZWVkNEBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE0NS4zM2VhNmE3NC4yZTdhZWVkNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":99621,"nextInTopic":99672,"prevInTime":99667,"nextInTime":99669,"topicId":99621,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I do that.  I don&#39;t always know the names of characters in books I&#39;m <br/>\nreading.  While I&#39;m reading I do, but it&#39;s as though the name is the picture <br/>\nof the character (not in a pictorial way, just in an identification way) but if <br/>\nasked later &quot;What&#39;s his sister&#39;s name?&quot; I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m reading Nicholas <br/>\nNickleby, which has TONS of characters, and some I couldn&#39;t name to you, but if <br/>\nI pick it up and start reading I will know all about each characters history <br/>\nand interrelationships.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read music I don&#39;t think in note-names anymore.
