All I can say is that I had to come to the <br/>\npoint where I really believed that the &quot;educational view&quot; of <br/>\nlearning was not superior to natural learning spawned by <br/>\ninterest and personal freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that my passion for learning is fueled by my drive to find <br/>\nout about what interests me, not by some group of ideas <br/>\nsomeone assembled somewhere that I ought to master. And I&#39;ve <br/>\nwatched as the things that I&#39;m interested in have led to things I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have cared about at all in an ordinary class setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nForgive me if I&#39;ve used this example here before.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a big U2 fan and read articles about the band every single <br/>\nday. Being a fan has meant growth in my undestanding of <br/>\npop/rock music, rock history, poetry and song lyrics (which I now <br/>\nteach as a result), and other bands I would never have heard of. <br/>\nBut it has led other places outside music too: the current AIDs <br/>\ncrisis in Africa which has led to my daughter and I volunteering at <br/>\nAIDs hospice in town, awareness of Sellafield (nuclear plant off <br/>\nthe coast of Ireland that is dangerously near to families... which <br/>\nled to learning about the Chernobyl&#39;s Children&#39;s project and an <br/>\nincreased interest in protecting all of us from nuclear dangers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also greatly influenced by Bono&#39;s very different faith which <br/>\nled to all my theological reading that has sent me in an entirely <br/>\nnew direction spiritually.<br/>\n<br/>\nand all this reading of the same story and material over and over <br/>\nhas made me keenly aware of good and bad writing which has <br/>\nimproved my own writing. Through my love for this band, I&#39;ve <br/>\nalready been hired to write about them twice!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll from listening to a band. I can imagine another mother <br/>\nthinking, &quot;All my son cares about is that band _________&quot; <br/>\nthinking that the child isn&#39;t learning anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I got to thinking: what would happen if my kids had similar <br/>\nopportunities to just go after what hooked their jaws?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve been playing X box and computer games non-stop for <br/>\nalmost four weeks now. (Yes, I was worried about it). But it&#39;s <br/>\nbeen great. I&#39;ve seen some surprising stuff result. One thing is, <br/>\nthey are sharing so much more easily now that their time isn&#39;t <br/>\nlimited. Secondly, they are playing games I didn&#39;t expect (I fully <br/>\nthought they&#39;d be bombing and shooting only. But Basketball is a <br/>\nfavorite and they play the two player version). Thirdly, they are <br/>\nalso doing other stuff!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think when we say that computer is all they&#39;ll do, we are <br/>\nshortchanging them as human beings.

With me, I think it is a control thing. I<br/>\nfeel like it is my responsibility to make sure my children grow up to be<br/>\nsuccessful, happy adults, and I lack the confidence in believing that I<br/>\nam capable of this. Somebody here sent me a reassuring note off list that<br/>\nsaid, in effect, that it is their lives. We can&#39;t control the outcome,<br/>\nonly to help them meet what they feel the outcome should be. This is hard<br/>\nfor me. But when I watch how my children live and learn, I find that they<br/>\nare happiest when I&#39;m not leading their way. My husband&#39;s and my intent<br/>\nbefore we ever had children was to homeschool them. We saw first hand how<br/>\nmandated school stifled childrens&#39; learning. We did not want this for our<br/>\nlittle blessings. With our first child, we were very *into* her learning,<br/>\nconstantly practicing A,B,Cs, counting, &quot;educating&quot;, and she did learn<br/>\nall these things. Second child came along, and things were really busy.<br/>\nWe just didn&#39;t have the time to spend &quot;educating&quot; her. She picked up<br/>\nthings as she went, just observing life and people. By *natural* means,<br/>\nshe has learned all these things on her own accord, and quite joyfully.<br/>\nThis is when I became interested in this concept of unschooling. Could<br/>\nthis really work or is it just some unproven theory? It was so different<br/>\nthan anything I have ever experienced or seen. I put it to the test. When<br/>\nfirst dd was about four and a half, I started working with her doing<br/>\nphonics. She knew all the letters and the sounds they made, but couldn&#39;t<br/>\nput them together. Then she plain out told me that she did not like<br/>\nsounding out words because she thought it was a waste of time. Here, ever<br/>\nsince I started reading to her at 3 weeks (what can I say, I love to<br/>\nread) she has been looking at the words as well as the pictures, and<br/>\nsomewhere along the line has memorized what I guess educators call *sight<br/>\nwords*. If I had continued to try to push her into learning to read in a<br/>\nway that was not comfortable to her, not only would I have stifled her<br/>\nnatural ability to learn, but I would be wasting a lot of time as well.<br/>\nIt is things like this that constantly remind me that I can only get in<br/>\nthe way of them learning, if I don&#39;t let go of this control/fear thing<br/>\nover them not learning without being taught. Sure, they may become happy,<br/>\nsuccessful adults in spite of my hang-ups, but I would rather make their<br/>\npath easier. It will be tough enough. I think that the best thing I can<br/>\ndo for my children, is to be there when they need me, trust their<br/>\ninstincts, and catch them if they fall. I think the sooner I let go of<br/>\nthe belief that I have control, the easier it will be to accept the fact<br/>\nthat they are their own person, and their definition of happiness and<br/>\nsuccess as an adult may be totally different than mine.  Different, but<br/>\nnot wrong. I don&#39;t know if any of this makes any sense. I&#39;m just a<br/>\n&quot;newbie&quot; trying to work this all out myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWende<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"Heidi &lt;bunsofaluminum60@hotmail.com&gt;","from":"&quot;Heidi &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: For Julie Bogart, and other &quot;newbies...&quot;","postDate":"1043878931","msgId":57044,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGIxOWs2ais2MGwyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExNy4xZTU4Mzc0Mi4yYjY5OTEwN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57025,"nextInTopic":57045,"prevInTime":57043,"nextInTime":57045,"topicId":57012,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Kelly, thanks! ...
