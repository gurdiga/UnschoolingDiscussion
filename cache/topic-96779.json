Here is part of it:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Coca-Cola®, like any other soft drink, is acidic. This is because a <br/>\nsmall amount of the carbon dioxide dissolved in soft drinks (to make <br/>\nthem effervescent) will react in solution to form carbonic acid. <br/>\nCarbonic acid may clean the rust from a nail, but it would not dissolve <br/>\na nail in 24 hours. Try it—a can of Coke® and a nail costs less than a <br/>\ndollar. Many common foods are acidic. That does not mean that they are <br/>\ndangerous.  Specialized cells in the human stomach wall secrete  <br/>\nhydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid is much stronger than carbonic <br/>\nacid, and will dissolve an iron nail easily. The contents of your <br/>\nstomach are usually at a pH of 2. Please don’t try the nail in the <br/>\nstomach contents experiment. There is no safe way to get a nail in your <br/>\nstomach, and there is no safe (or polite) way to remove the contents of <br/>\nyour stomach to apply it a nail. You will just have to trust me on that <br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: being imperious, and death, and coca cola","postDate":"1090773445","msgId":96847,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM0LjExNmFjZTFlLjJlMzUzYmM1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":96846,"nextInTopic":96848,"prevInTime":96846,"nextInTime":96848,"topicId":96779,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/25/04 10:26:35 AM, pyxiewytch@comcast.net writes:  Any","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1390214416\">In a message dated 7/25/04 10:26:35 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pyxiewytch@...\">pyxiewytch@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I know from experience that toothpaste is great for polishing silver... &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAny toothpaste?
