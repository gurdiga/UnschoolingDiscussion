But<br/>\nit has no basis in MA reality. WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO TEST. We have an end<br/>\nof year assessment and parents must approve the form. If testing isn&#39;t<br/>\nappropriate to the style of homeschooling, then parents would reject that<br/>\nform of assessment and choose another one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems to me I&#39;ve explained the MA process about 5 times. And for some reason<br/>\npeople are giving more weight to opinions offered by people outside the<br/>\nstate and nonhomeschoolers inside the state than they are to an unschooler<br/>\nin the state.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think people are listening to these opinions of outsiders because the made<br/>\nup scenarios make more sense to people. The scenarios match what they<br/>\nimagine must be true for this case to have happened and for it to be about<br/>\nhomeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it isn&#39;t true. The scenarios are made up. They&#39;re fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe state is choosing testing for the Bryant kids because the Bryant kids<br/>\nare now in the state&#39;s legal custody. The state is serving as parents so the<br/>\nstate gets to choose the form of assessment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it sorta like <br/>\n&gt; which came first, the chicken or the egg?  Did they want to challenge the<br/>\n&gt; Constitution so they choose to do it by unschooling/homeschooling their<br/>\n&gt; children by not meeting the laws but defying them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I hope not!<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir kids seem okay so I suspect they saw an opportunity that already<br/>\nexisted in their life that they could use to make a legal point.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a guess based on more knowledge, but I dont know how much it&#39;s really<br/>\nworth.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Did they unschool/homeschool and find the laws/Constitution unfair to them as<br/>\n&gt; parents and to their children so they decided to challenge them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That would only make sense if there were no other homeschoolers in MA. Are<br/>\nthe laws only unfair to the Bryants? Why? And if the laws are unfair to all<br/>\nhomeschoolers, then why are the Bryants the only ones who care?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If they are acting on this as homeschoolers/unschoolers who want their<br/>\n&gt; children not to be in the control of the State, it seems to me it has<br/>\n&gt; everything to <br/>\n&gt; do with unschooling/homeschooling.  But then I&#39;ve been wrong before.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>IF. HUGE &quot;IF&quot; that you&#39;re basing on what knowledge of MA homeschooling?<br/>\nYou&#39;re presuming there must be control in order for this case to be about<br/>\nhomeschooling. That&#39;s what everyone is doing. They&#39;ve concluded the case<br/>\nmust be about homeschooling and then they&#39;re making up what must be true in<br/>\norder for it to be about homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe control in MA is minimal. The case isn&#39;t about homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but I <br/>\n&gt; do find it interesting to hear what others think/feel about such an<br/>\n&gt; emotionally <br/>\n&gt; charged issue, particularly since their hope in all of this is to change laws<br/>\n&gt; regarding homeschool/unschool issues<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>::: beating head on screen again :::<br/>\n<br/>\nPeaple outside of MA can only offer opinions on the scenario they&#39;ve made up<br/>\nto fit the facts. Their scenario is wrong and their opinions are<br/>\nmeaningless.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t about homeschooling. It doesn&#39;t affect the laws in MA.

It would be about<br/>\nLibertarianism, not about homeschooling. If the results of their battle for<br/>\nLibertarianism had a positive side effect on homeschooling, it&#39;s a pretty<br/>\nround about chancy route if their intent was to effect homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the Bryants wanted to fight to change homeschooling laws they would have<br/>\nchosen a route that would have rallied the support of homeschoolers in MA.<br/>\nThe route they chose irritated more homeschoolers than it inspired.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Because they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; like being told their children HAVE to be tested because they are<br/>\n&gt; homeschooled.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>HOMESCHOOLING PARENTS DON&#39;T HAVE TO TEST.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the Bryants don&#39;t get to choose now because they lost the right.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If it were about not wanting to license their dogs or get the<br/>\n&gt; rabies <br/>\n&gt; vaccinations and they were ALSO homeschoolers then I could understand how it<br/>\n&gt; is NOT <br/>\n&gt; about homeschooling at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is not about homeschooling.

No one else can know enough to make their opinions on<br/>\nthe rightness or wrongness of what happened mean anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe worthwhile comments from others seemed to be respectful of the extent of<br/>\nwhat they could and couldn&#39;t know about the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you&#39;re addressing the subject as though there were some universal<br/>\nprinciples about homeschooling involved. The case is about the wording in<br/>\nthe state constitution of Massachusetts. The motivations of all parties<br/>\ninvolved are based on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could discuss the principle of how far we would stand up for what we<br/>\nbelieve in but you can&#39;t draw on what the Bryants did or didn&#39;t do or why<br/>\nthe did what they did because it&#39;s unknowable outside the state and only<br/>\nvaguely guessable by people inside the state.

Because it wasn&#39;t about<br/>\nhomeschooling. They made it about homeschooling.

But it is wrong to<br/>\ncharacterize them as poor naive homeschoolers being beaten up by the big bad<br/>\nbureaucracy.

The case was in and out of court for over 4 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and now that that&#39;s happened, they&#39;re continuing to safeguard<br/>\n&gt; their children&#39;s right to a child-focused education.  They&#39;re making the<br/>\n&gt; best they can of a seriously fubar&#39;d legal situation.  (and, the kids don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; seem to be adversely affected by what&#39;s gone on.  The quotes in the article<br/>\n&gt; were from the kids, weren&#39;t they?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I admire them for having been able to balance a very time consuming project<br/>\nwhile giving their children the attention they needed. (Or so it appears. We<br/>\ncan&#39;t really know.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they chose the battle. They chose to take a stand on the constitution<br/>\nwhile raising a family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If the family does as the state wants, then they lend authenticity to the<br/>\n&gt; state&#39;s current belief that the state, not the parents, have charge of each<br/>\n&gt; child&#39;s education.  This can harm independent homeschoolers in the years to<br/>\n&gt; follow.  (and yes, there is also the difficulty that the state may get<br/>\n&gt; punative because of this dedication and demand for legal rights.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>These are wonderfully rousing words.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut how would it feel if I, as a resident of MA, using misinformation and<br/>\nguesswork and wishful thinking, told you what the atmosphere was like and<br/>\nwhat the future held for homeschoolers in California?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I were them, I&#39;d probably have gone underground or found an out-of-state<br/>\n&gt; unschooler to umbrella me instead of submitting even a few sentences of<br/>\n&gt; &#39;curriculum&#39; or whatever they want to &#39;overview&#39; of my kids<br/>\n&gt; education.  Thankfully, I live in California where I can do away with<br/>\n&gt; intervention by declaring myself a private school.<br/>\n&gt; Thank goodness for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So you need to ask yourself why they didn&#39;t do that. They aren&#39;t stupid.<br/>\nThey aren&#39;t naive. They went into this with open eyes. They could have moved<br/>\nto another town when they started having difficulties with Waltham. (Waltham<br/>\ndidn&#39;t start it. The town asked for what they believe the state says they<br/>\ncan ask for. (And if they were wrong, it&#39;s easy enough to point out the<br/>\nrelevant parts of the case law to them.) The Bryants *chose* not to submit<br/>\nan education plan because they believed the state didn&#39;t have the right to<br/>\nmake any laws beyond the constitutuion. *Not* because the request is<br/>\nburdensome. It&#39;s very easy to comply. So, again, the Bryants weren&#39;t caught<br/>\nunaware.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bryants could have bailed at many points during the 4 years. The first<br/>\ncourt case ended with them being ordered to submit an education plan. (Right<br/>\nback where they started, except they had to submit retroactive education<br/>\nplans. Stupid, yes, but their initial stance about the ed plans didn&#39;t have<br/>\na basis in reality either.) They chose to keep battling. Unlike the western<br/>\nstates which are so large, it&#39;s easy to work in MA and live in another<br/>\nstate. They could have done that. Why didn&#39;t they?<br/>\n<br/>\nI seem to have met a good many unschoolers in MA. Or at least relaxed<br/>\nhomeschoolers who claim to be unschoolers ;-) Anyway there are quite a few<br/>\nof us. We&#39;re the home of John Holt and Growing Without Unschooling after<br/>\nall. If it was difficult to unschool in MA and the Bryants were fighting to<br/>\nmake it possible, they would have had a lot of support. But they weren&#39;t<br/>\nfighting for that. So they didn&#39;t get a lot of support.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe too are not stupid. We don&#39;t need outsiders to tell us after the fact how<br/>\nto interpret what was happening right in front of us. We *lived* it.

That&#39;s more than double the volume of last year.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the list serving it&#39;s purpose at that volume? Can people get unschooling<br/>\ninformation with 125 emails to read every day?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some people the answer is yes because they&#39;re connecting with other<br/>\nunschoolers.

(These are suggestions to judge our own behavior by, not the<br/>\nbehavior of others.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a poster, <br/>\n<br/>\n1) keep in mind the purpose of the list is unschooling discussion. Ask<br/>\nyourself if what you&#39;re about to send will help anyone unschool better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would, of course, eliminate all the chit chat and that would be bad!<br/>\nChit chat makes the place friendly.

If 3 people are making the same point, you don&#39;t<br/>\nneed to respond to all 3 with separate emails containing the same arguments.<br/>\nCombine it into one post.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) It&#39;s lots easier and more fun to respond to breezy posts about life than<br/>\nabout unschooling. But the list isn&#39;t so useful if people spend their time<br/>\nposting on the easy stuff and end up, because of lack of time, giving<br/>\ncursory answers to the unschooling questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a reader, it&#39;s useful to learn how to cut down on what you pay attention<br/>\nto. As in all aspects of life, we&#39;re suffering information overload. The<br/>\nlist is no different. Just as we can&#39;t* stop publishers from publishing too<br/>\nmany good books, or TV producers from making too many good TV shows, we<br/>\ncan&#39;t stop people from saying things on the list they feel are important.<br/>\nLearning how to filter is a useful skill with the list and with life in<br/>\ngeneral.<br/>\n<br/>\n(*Well, actually, I can stop people. And the list can stop people but it<br/>\ndisrupts the usefulness of the list.

(At least as far as I&#39;m able to<br/>\nunderstand the legal mumbo jumbo. I think the term for their beliefs is<br/>\nConstitutionalists.) The Bryants have been using their homeschooling for<br/>\nyears as a vehicle to make a point about the constitution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey lost.

(I just send in a couple of<br/>\nsentences on each subject each year.) Since the state is the children&#39;s<br/>\nlegal guardians the state, therefore, according to the case law, gets to<br/>\ndetermine the form of assessment. The Bryants lost their right to make<br/>\ndecisions for their children when legal custody was taken away.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kenneth Pontes, area director of DSS, denied that workers have never talked to<br/>\n&gt; the children privately, but admitted that this type of case isn&#39;t often seen<br/>\n&gt; by his office.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;This is an unusual case.

It said nothing<br/>\n  about <br/>\n  taking the test,&quot; said George Bryant.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The second refusal came after an <br/>\n  emotion-filled morning for the family,<br/>\n  when DSS workers sternly demanded the Bryants <br/>\n  comply with their orders.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;We have legal custody of the children and we will do with <br/>\n  them as we<br/>\n  see fit,&quot; DSS worker Susan Etscovitz told the Bryants in their Gale<br/>\n<br/>\n  Street home. &quot;They are minors and they do what we tell them to do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Four police <br/>\n  officers were also at the scene and attempted to coax the<br/>\n  Bryants to listen to <br/>\n  the DSS worker.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;We are simply here to prevent a breach of the peace,&quot; said <br/>\n  Waltham<br/>\n  Youth Officer Detective James Auld. &quot;We will will not physically remove<br/>\n<br/>\n  the children.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yesterday&#39;s events are the continuation of a six-year legal battle<br/>\n<br/>\n  between the family and Waltham Public Schools and the state.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The Bryants <br/>\n  contend that the city and state do not have the legal right<br/>\n  to force their children <br/>\n  to take standardized tests, even though DSS<br/>\n  workers have threatened to take <br/>\n  their children from them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;There have been threats all along. Most families fall to <br/>\n  that bullying<br/>\n  by the state and the legal system,&quot; said George Bryant.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;But this <br/>\n  has been a six-year battle between the Waltham Public Schools<br/>\n  and our family <br/>\n  over who is in control of the education of our children,&quot;<br/>\n  Bryant continued. &quot;In <br/>\n  the end the law of this state will protect us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  The Bryant children have never <br/>\n  attended public school.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Both sides agree that the children are in no way abused <br/>\n  mentally,<br/>\n  physically, sexually or emotionally, but legal custody of the <br/>\n  children<br/>\n  was taken from Kim and George Bryant in December 2001. The children will<br/>\n<br/>\n  remain under the legal custody of DSS until their 16th birthdays.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The parents have <br/>\n  been ruled as unfit because they did not file<br/>\n  educational plans or determine a <br/>\n  grading system for the children, two<br/>\n  criteria of Waltham Public School&#39;s home <br/>\n  schooling policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;We do not believe in assessing our children based on a number <br/>\n  or<br/>\n  letter. Their education process is their personal intellectual<br/>\n  property,&quot; <br/>\n  said Bryant.<br/>\n<br/>\n  George Bryant said he was arrested six years ago, after not <br/>\n  attending a<br/>\n  meeting that the city contends he was summoned to. The meeting was<br/>\n  called by <br/>\n  the Waltham School Department for his failure to send his<br/>\n  children to school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;We want these issues aired in the open, in public. The school system<br/>\n  and DSS <br/>\n  have fought to keep this behind closed doors,&quot; said Bryant.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Superintendent of <br/>\n  Schools Susan Parrella said she was unaware of<br/>\n  yesterday&#39;s incident and that, <br/>\n  currently the school department approves<br/>\n  of the education plan filed by DSS for the <br/>\n  Bryant children.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;An acceptable home school plan is in place right now,&quot; said <br/>\n  Parrella.<br/>\n  &quot;I was not aware of any testing occurring today.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  The Bryant children <br/>\n  freely admit that they have no intention of taking a<br/>\n  test.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;We don&#39;t want to <br/>\n  take the test. We have taken them before and I don&#39;t<br/>\n  think they are a fair <br/>\n  assessment of what we know,&quot; said Nyssa Bryant.<br/>\n  &quot;And no one from DSS has ever asked us <br/>\n  what we think.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kenneth Pontes, area director of DSS, denied that workers have <br/>\n  never<br/>\n  talked to the children privately, but admitted that this type of case<br/>\n<br/>\n  isn&#39;t often seen by his office.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;This is an unusual case. Different school systems <br/>\n  require different<br/>\n  regulations for home-schooled children. Waltham requires <br/>\n  testing,&quot; said<br/>\n  Pontes.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Pontes said that a possibility exists that the children will <br/>\n  be removed<br/>\n  from their home, but that was a last course of action.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;No one wants <br/>\n  these children to be put in foster homes. The best course<br/>\n  of action would for <br/>\n  (the Bryants) to instruct the children to take the<br/>\n  test,&quot; said Etscovitz.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The <br/>\n  Bryant family is due in Framingham District Court this morning, to<br/>\n  go before a <br/>\n  juvenile court judge. According to DSS, this session will<br/>\n  determine what their <br/>\n  next course of action will be and if the children<br/>\n  will be removed from the <br/>\n  Bryants&#39; home.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;These are our children and they have and always will be willing<br/>\n<br/>\n  participants in their education,&quot; said Kim Bryant.<br/>\n<br/>\n  --<br/>\n  Dr. Chris R.
