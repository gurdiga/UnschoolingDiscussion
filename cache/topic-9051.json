Colton can learn better one-on-one with me, I <br/>\ncan shield him from improper influences, etc.  But thinking this through a <br/>\nlittle more carefully, I realize my reasons go a lot deeper.  Here are just a <br/>\nfew of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I unschool because I was there when my son first held a butterfly.  I <br/>\nunschool because it given me time to sit with my son, sewing patches on his <br/>\nScout uniform, while he works on a Pokemon scrapbook and tells me stories.  I <br/>\nunschool because I introduced Colton to the wonderful book &quot;Charlotte&#39;s Web,&quot; <br/>\nand we both cried when Charlotte died.  I unschool because the moment I found <br/>\nout that my father had to have brain surgery, Colton was there with me and we <br/>\ncould pray together.  I unschool because when I battled cancer and <br/>\nchemotherapy, Colton and I could snuggle together in bed and read living <br/>\nbooks, and he would remind me that I had just eleven more treatments to go.  <br/>\nI unschool because I am head-over-heels in love with this tender soul who <br/>\ncame into my life not quite ten years ago, and I don&#39;t want to miss a minute <br/>\nof it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9033,"nextTopicId":9050}}
