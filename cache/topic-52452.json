But, I know I can&#39;t <br/>\ngo back and nurse him now and eating myself up over it now wont help either.  <br/>\n  Back to thumb sucking.  Since it was on my mind, I brought it up to him <br/>\ntoday.  He and I were going to the grocery store.  He was sucking his thumb.  <br/>\nI said. , smiling &quot;is that thumb good?&#39;  He immediately got defensive and <br/>\nsaid. &quot;everybody asks me that!&quot;  ( I wasnt aware he was asked this question <br/>\noften)  I said.. &quot;Oh.. they do, well, is it?&quot;  He said.. &quot;Its good and bad.. <br/>\nits right in the middle of good and bad&quot;  I asked him what he meant. He said <br/>\n&quot; I like sucking my thumb, it feels good, but people talk about me &quot;   I <br/>\nsaid.. Oh, so you it makes you feel good, but you dont like people talking <br/>\nabout it. He said ,&quot;yeah, but I cant stop&quot;  I said&quot; do you want to stop?&quot;  He <br/>\nsaid, &quot;not really&quot;    .. I just patted his leg and didnt say anything else  I <br/>\n really didnt know what else to say.<br/>\n<br/>\n..   OH, then this happened in the dollar store.  He had $1.50 and he wanted <br/>\nto go buy this brothers and sister a christmas present.    I took him in the <br/>\ndollar store and told him he could pick thier gifts out and I would pay for <br/>\nthem.  He got a car for Ethan, a box of candy for Landon, some peanuts for <br/>\nhis Dad and he found a necklace ( that was actually kind of gaudy.. lol) that <br/>\nhe LOVED for Anna.. He was so excited over that necklace.  He said &quot; Anna <br/>\nwill love it!&quot;  When we went to check out, he asked if he could pay for the <br/>\nnecklace himself... I said, &quot;of course you can if you want to&quot;   He proudly <br/>\npaid for the necklace and told the cashier that he was buying it for his <br/>\nsister.  She commended him and said that was so sweet of him.  I said, yeah, <br/>\nhe picked these gifts out for his brothers and sister, but he wants to pay <br/>\nfor his sister&#39;s with his own money.   Then, a little old lady came up to him <br/>\nand gave him a handful of change.  She said. :&quot;Here sweety, you take this <br/>\nchange because you done something nice&quot;   JP was shocked.  He smiled and <br/>\nthanked her.. She said, when you do good things, it comes back to you.   I <br/>\nthanked her too and wished her a Merry Christmas.   JP was so proud... WHen <br/>\nwe got back in the van, I said.. You did such a great job picking out gifts.  <br/>\n And you were so grown up and polite, that lady was impressed with how you <br/>\nwere behaving.   The Dollar Store is usually one of the hot &quot;meltdown&quot; spots <br/>\nfor JP,  he begs for things and throws tantrums.   I could see the <br/>\nrealization in his eyes like an epiphany.     That sweet little lady probably <br/>\n helped to  teach him how good behavior is rewarding more than anything I <br/>\ncould have said or done to convince him.  It was much more her recognition of <br/>\nhim than the money she gave him.  It was her praising him and going on about <br/>\nhow sweet he was, it made him feel very proud.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52390,"nextTopicId":52426}}
