She is just<br/>\ndifferent.  She climbs like a monkey.  She likes to sleep on the fridge,<br/>\nor in the sink.   And there&#39;s that noise.<br/>\nBut, she&#39;s a wonderful hiking partner and will stop at nothing.  She<br/>\nhiked across the basalt flows with me at Newberry Crater and that wasn&#39;t<br/>\neasy for someone without shoes.  She&#39;d go into a cave or up or down a<br/>\ncliff to follow me.  <br/>\nShe has this incredible expressive face.  <br/>\nMy husband hates her passionately, but he still shares his pizza crust<br/>\nwith her.  She won&#39;t let anyone in the house or yard unless we say it&#39;s<br/>\nok.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s little, but she has a big heart. <br/>\nShe&#39;s never been hunting but she gets wildly excited about mountain lion<br/>\ntracks and bear scat!<br/>\n<br/>\n***Shih Tzus were bred to sit in your lap and draw fleas!

His name is Pie<br/>\nand my son actually made a comic strip out of him.  The cartoon Pie has a<br/>\nrotor like tail and can fly.   He is Sky Pie.&lt;g&gt;  My mother comes over to<br/>\nsit and rock him in the rocking chair.  He might be a little spoiled.  We<br/>\nare fortunate enough to not have a flea problem here in Western Montana. <br/>\n He stomps spiders unless we rescue them.  He likes dill pickles.  He<br/>\ndigs my tulip bulbs out of the ground and carries them around.  I had the<br/>\nhardest time planting onion sets this year because he would come along<br/>\nbehind and dig them out.  I got a lot of exercise chasing him down. <br/>\nAerobic gardening.  He does a weird little dance when the Basenji sings. <br/>\nThey&#39;re a perfect pair.<br/>\n<br/>\n***The main problem with the way people pick out a breed is that they<br/>\ndon&#39;t <br/>\nconsider what the dog was bred for (that ol&#39; &quot;form follows function&quot;<br/>\nagain! <br/>\nand not just for looks, but behavior). *** <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my youth, (ok I was 27) I,  shall we say &quot;liberated&quot;  the Basenji from<br/>\nan unhappy situation. The Shi tzu was a three day dog sitting job.  That<br/>\nwas three years ago and I never heard from the man again.  His sister did<br/>\noffer to take the little dog but after hearing how their last dog met his<br/>\ndemise I decided we liked him well enough to keep him here.  Someday I<br/>\nmay actually select a dog on purpose instead of just acquiring what ever<br/>\ncomes along.
