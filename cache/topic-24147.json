Double some recipe, or cut it in half.  Cut a pie or cake into slices - more or less than you need, and discuss the relative size of each piece as you have more or less pieces.  Use a smaller measuring spoon than required, and figure out how many of them you should use now.  (like using a half-teaspoon spoon to measure 1 tablespoon&#39;s worth).  Use the 1/4 cup measure to get your 2.75 cups of flour.

Zak has been to 7 different preschools (1 of <br/>\nwhich is a Kindergarten) and one of those schools he&#39;s been too twice.  You <br/>\nwould have thought that by now I would have made the decision that <br/>\nunschooling him is the best way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m reading Linda Dobson&#39;s &quot;The First Year of Homeschooling&quot; and it&#39;s been so <br/>\nmuch help to me in making me look at myself and what I&#39;m expecting of me.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve made a list of pro&#39;s and cons for unschooling (I can&#39;t imagine doing <br/>\nanything formal) and there are only 2 cons and they both have to do with me.  <br/>\nOne is that I won&#39;t be able to work on my business during the day because <br/>\nI&#39;ll have both kids and the second is that if I send him to school I won&#39;t <br/>\nhave find kids for Zak to socialize with.. All of the pros had to do with the <br/>\nkids.  So far I&#39;ve come up with 7 reasons to unschool Zak and eventually Max <br/>\n(2) next month....I&#39;ll get there completely soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Zak and I talked for half an hour about smoke detectors, fire, <br/>\nsmoke, what to do in the event of a fire, why he was scared of smoke <br/>\ndetectors.  He stayed up till 9:30pm (normally goes to bed at 7:30pm) and he <br/>\nalso came into our bed and then talked about a different subject.  It was <br/>\nwonderful.  Some of the best conversations I have with Zak are late at night <br/>\nwhere I&#39;m just answering his many, many questions.
