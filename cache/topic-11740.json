Different people are offended by <br/>\ndifferent things. I am not often receptive to a message, however good it may <br/>\nbe, when it is expressed in a manner I find offensive. Here&#39;s an example. In <br/>\ncollege, I was constantly harassed by a couple of male friends who would <br/>\nliterally yell at me whenever I would wear noticeable make-up. They insisted <br/>\nI looked much better without it and that I was just buying into someone <br/>\nelse&#39;s idea of what I should look like, and doing myself a disservice in the <br/>\nprocess. I eventually came to agree with them on several points. However at <br/>\nthe time I mentally deleted their message because it was communicated in a <br/>\nway I found demeaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not have been offended by that particular post either, but it&#39;s not <br/>\nmy place to tell someone else what they should find offensive. I don&#39;t delete <br/>\nopinions that are simply different from mine. I rather enjoy reading them. <br/>\nThere is even one particular woman on a list I am on who constantly says <br/>\nthings offensive to me as a person of color, but she is so unbelievably funny <br/>\nI have to read all her posts and take her attitude in stride. Instead of <br/>\nstarting or participating in a flame war, I often delete things that are <br/>\noffensive on a personal level, after I&#39;ve read them, and don&#39;t look back. I <br/>\nrarely delete without reading, unless the subject is obviously not of <br/>\ninterest. I don&#39;t worry that there will be some lone life-changing post out <br/>\nthere that I&#39;ll miss either.<br/>\ncandice<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nHold fast to dreams<br/>\nFor if dreams die<br/>\nLife is a broken-winged bird<br/>\nThat cannot fly.<br/>\n-Langston Hughes</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"cathie","from":"&quot;cathie &quot; &lt;cathie_98@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"nlgM5t0bATx_QTWVudol3CwyZQaMBgKCRObWAYHrXzkkdDtl01xzDYLTW3epblANjPsGptjNQQeghPXhxywsrbVpro4wBWIX","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Father&#39;s who want control/Meshell","postDate":"965423706","msgId":11745,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhtZmJvcStoZWNyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGI2LjhkMDg2ZWQuMjZiYzg0MjBAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11743,"nextInTopic":11752,"prevInTime":11744,"nextInTime":11746,"topicId":11740,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... had a ... filled with ... be ...
