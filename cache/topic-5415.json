Using a plastic detergent scoop lift out your presoaked paper and puree it <br/>\nin your blender to reduce it even smaller into what we call pulp. Only do <br/>\nsmall amounts at a time and add additional water to the blender if needed <br/>\notherwise you burn the blender up (I know from experience!) Takes less than a <br/>\nminute or so in the blender. Stir in your seeds as liberally as you want or <br/>\nwait and stick them in by hand when you screen your pulp.<br/>\n3. We took 4 inch square pieces of old window screening and placed them in<br/>\nour <br/>\nleft hand. With our right hand we poured the pulp onto the screen. Hold the <br/>\nscreen over a bucket when doing the pouring because all the excess water runs <br/>\nthrough the screen and leaves the pulp.<br/>\n4. lay the screen with the pulp on an old newspaper and lay a 5 inch piece of <br/>\nfelt over the pulp and roll with your rolling pin.. This takes out the excess <br/>\nwater. You can gently pick up the screen and flip the felt over in your hand. <br/>\nPeel the screen off the paper and lay it and the felt down to dry. Once dry <br/>\nyou can peel it from the felt to plant later or send to a friend, etc.<br/>\n5. You know you can experiment without adding seeds and add pieces of nature <br/>\nto your pulp and see what it does to your paper. Try dry grasses, leaves, <br/>\npetals, threads, colored paper, sandetc. Have Fun!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"A. Yates","from":"&quot;A.
