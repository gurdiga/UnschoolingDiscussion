Gosh, when they are <br/>\nhere, they drive you crazy.  When they aren&#39;t, they drive you crazy; especially <br/>\nwhen they are sooooo far away!  I just can&#39;t wait till I see her face!  I <br/>\nmiss her so very much!  Her plane is not due to land until 10p tonight.  Let you <br/>\nall know how she is/how the trip went, sometime this weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, LOL, she IS NOT going to be too happy when I tell her that <br/>\nKings Island called w/her work schedule!  She is DUE IN at 10a tomorrow <br/>\n(Saturday) morning.  Hmm, thank goodness she&#39;s a kid and can take this stuff!  Me?  <br/>\nI&#39;d need a vacation FROM my vacation!  Then again, I&#39;m sure digging up <br/>\nDinosaurs was pretty hard on the body.  And, I&#39;M SURE, 8 teens got A LOT of sleep.  <br/>\nNOT!<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\nPS:  Again, I&#39;m sorry if you got duplicates.
