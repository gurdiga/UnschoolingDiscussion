I love the book and the movie.  Also, The Secret of Roan <br/>\nInish.  Then there are some that have some people who don&#39;t treat others as <br/>\nthey should but are still not the evil villain type.  I love The Black <br/>\nStallion.<br/>\n    For older kids, there are movies like What&#39;s Eating Gilbert Grape, Sense <br/>\nand Sensibility, Fried Green Tomatoes, A Walk in the Clouds, Driving Miss <br/>\nDaisy...there are so many; these are just some I love.  I don&#39;t tend to think <br/>\nin terms of &quot;kids&quot; movies as they get older.  People are surprised that my <br/>\nkids (all boys) like movies like these but I think most boys will if they <br/>\njust get a chance to be exposed to them rather than having parents assume <br/>\nthey won&#39;t like them.<br/>\n   I like kids to see movies that help foster empathy in them for the many <br/>\nvarieties of the human condition.  I do wrestle with the violence issue <br/>\nmyself because there are movies and stories I love that do have violence (The <br/>\nLast of the Mohicans, for example).  I have allowed my older kids to see <br/>\nthese (ages 11 and 15) but sometimes I wonder if they would be better off if <br/>\nthey had never seen ANY form of violence.  They saw Cry Freedom, about the <br/>\napartheid situation in South Africa (specifically about Steven Bico) and I <br/>\nfelt like that story had a lot of value.  I do want them to have a sense of <br/>\noutrage at injustice.  But it&#39;s a hard issue for me.  <br/>\n    There are also movies and shows that I am even MORE ambivalent about like <br/>\nX Files, yet I still allow my older ones to watch.  I know the show myself <br/>\nand can understand the appeal for them but I&#39;m torn.  Not easy issues....<br/>\n<br/>\n    Lucy in Calif.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4443,"nextTopicId":4456}}
