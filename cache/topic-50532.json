I have 5 kids, ages 12 to 3, and this post is in<br/>\nreference to the older two.  We are radical unschoolers and the kids are in<br/>\ncomplete control of what they do or don&#39;t do and have been for several<br/>\nyears.  Here is the problem:  I end up having to nag.  Example:  Adriane and<br/>\nZach signed up for a dog training project with 4-H.  Once a week they meet<br/>\nwith a professional trainer and then have daily practice with their dogs.<br/>\nWe discussed all of what was required with the project before they signed up<br/>\nand the kids were sure it wouldn&#39;t be a problem, in fact it was their idea,<br/>\netc..  Well, a few weeks into the project and the kids forget to train their<br/>\nanimals.  I gently ask if the dogs have been trained and I get &quot;Oh yeah, in<br/>\na minute, I want to watch this&quot; or whatever.  Well, the minute comes and<br/>\ngoes and the dog doesn&#39;t get trained, the day comes and goes and the dog<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get trained, then when they meet with the trainer, the entire class<br/>\nis slowed down because my kids didn&#39;t do what they agreed they would do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an ongoing thing with almost all of their projects or activities.<br/>\nLast night, the kids wanted to bring the dogs inside.  I said fine but<br/>\nplease don&#39;t fall asleep with the dogs in the house, make sure you put the<br/>\ndogs out before you go to bed.  I then go to bed and an hour or so later<br/>\nwake up...Adriane has gone to bed and Zach is asleep in the chair and both<br/>\ndogs are roaming the house. (We have a very old (18 years) cat that the dogs<br/>\nlike to harass).  I bounced the kids up and had them do what they said they<br/>\nwould do in the first place but I didn&#39;t like how that felt.  Often I pick<br/>\nup the slack but then I feel put upon because the kids said they would take<br/>\ncare of it and they didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nZach will use his father&#39;s tools and just leave them laying around all over<br/>\nthe place.  He is well aware that he is welcome and encouraged to use<br/>\nanything he wants if he will just put it back when he is done.  He doesn&#39;t.<br/>\nI remind him and I get put off.  It usually then doesn&#39;t get picked up at<br/>\nall unless I remind him again (nag).  Yuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I am still having to control, having to make them do things or<br/>\nhaving to tell them &quot;no, because remember last time.....&quot;  I have fallen<br/>\ninto this role and I don&#39;t like it.  I do resent the fact that the kids<br/>\nchoose to do these things and then I&#39;m the one left holding the bag.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk about this stuff at length.  &quot;Why do you think you are having a<br/>\nproblem remembering....&quot;, &quot;What do you think would help....&quot;, &quot;What if we<br/>\ntried.....&quot;      The kids see my point and it is better for a day or two and<br/>\nthen we are right back to Mom being everybody&#39;s nag about stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp me get a better grip on this.
