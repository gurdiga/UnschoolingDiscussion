Her","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1174628637\">I have been feeling so grateful for the conference all week but have been too busy interacting with my visiting SIL and her kids to get in to post.  Her controlling parenting has been highlighted by having been around so many parents who choose to respect their children.  It&#39;s been hard to keep my mouth shut but my kids&#39; actions have spoken for me.  My 6yo didn&#39;t want to go with them to the science museum one day (was busy farming) and it set my SIL off.  She couldn&#39;t believe we would allow him to choose not to go.  I am hoping that her huge reaction to him and the subsequent embarassment she felt made her think a bit about the whole control issue.  It is hard towatch her kids so trapped by her routine and morning studies (all summer in prep. for going back to school) and not say anything.  It&#39;s been a sad week.  <br/>\n <br/>\nTHANKYOU Kelly and all of the speakers and parents...There were so many fabulous moments.  One of the biggest highlights for me was watching Rowan in both of her numbers at the talent show just bravely do her thing - be it making up a story on the spot or juggle with one ball.  She personified pure innocence and trust.  It was great.  The whole talent show was so much fun.  And seeing Sandra and Marty&#39;s identical fabulous smiles;  watching Ben talk about rules vs. principles and realizing that he was at this point despite a military background;  watching my friend that came with me getting it.  She is going to unschool now!   I am eager to have my family come with me next time.  But they are def. benefiting from my having gone.  Oh.  I highly recommend Sandra&#39;s thinking sticks for young ones too.  My 6yo can&#39;t get enough of them!  <br/>\n <br/>\nMadeline<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo! Search - Faster. Easier.

Chocolate milk, I <br/>\nlike the way he thinks.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had an &quot;moment&quot; or actually several moments.. on our way home from <br/>\nthe conference.   We stopped to have dinner at O&#39;Charleys in a town <br/>\n(cant remember the name of it) along I-77, still in SC, about 15 <br/>\nminutes out of Charlotte.   There was a fella doing magic tricks for <br/>\nthe kids waiting for thier meals.

I <br/>\nusually just say homeschool and smile and nod and agree with whatever <br/>\nfolks say.  This guy looked like he was going to freak out or <br/>\nsomething.   I said, &quot;We just live our lives, we do whatever we want <br/>\nto, the conference was great, there were about 300 other folks there <br/>\nthat are just like us!&quot;   He kept shaking his head and frowning, <br/>\nlooking at the kids from one to the other.  I said. &quot;What did you do <br/>\nin the summer break when you were in school?&quot;  He listed a few fun <br/>\nthings, and I said ..&quot; See, thats what we do all year, just like <br/>\nthere is no such thing as school&quot;   Then he looked at me dead on and <br/>\nsaid. &quot;You&#39;re kidding, right?&quot;   We all laughed and said.. &quot;No, we&#39;re <br/>\nnot kidding&quot;  He just could not grasp the concept.  He kept <br/>\nsaying, &quot;how do they learn&quot;  I said.. &quot;What??? do they look stupid or <br/>\nsomething?&quot;  He said. &quot;Uhh, no no no.&quot;  By this time, the kids were <br/>\nanxious to see the card tricks so he started his little show.  He <br/>\nkept making little jokes about homeschooling..  He did one trick and <br/>\none of the kids said. &quot;hey, thats Tromp l&#39;oeil!&quot;   LOL..  the guy <br/>\nlaughed and said... well yeah, I guess you could call it that.. And I <br/>\nwent on to tell him that we saw a slide show from an artist who does <br/>\nTromp L&#39;oeil.  He asked me who the artist was and I told him it was <br/>\nChristian Thee.   THEN, he said that he was good friends with <br/>\nChristian Thee!  He knows him from a magic club they both attend.  So <br/>\nTHEN I told him that the lady who coordinated the conference was <br/>\nfriends with Mr Thee and I asked him if he knew Kelly Lovejoy.. He <br/>\nsaid he did!  He said he was friends with Kelly too!!  From the magic <br/>\nclub.  I said.. &quot;Well, you know, Kelly unschools her kids too&quot;  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think he knew that.. LOL. (btw, Kelly, his name was Chris)<br/>\n<br/>\n  He went on to lecture, and I mean lecture with the pointing finger <br/>\nand all, straight to my kids faces,  not even looking at me, like he <br/>\nas warning them about me or something!.. about the importance of math <br/>\nand higer math and geometery and stuff.  He kept saying... &quot;You need <br/>\nto learn it!.. LEARN THE MATH!.. looking and pointing at each of <br/>\nthem.  LEARN THE MATH, you will need it to get in college and get a <br/>\ngood job!&quot;  My kids just kind of looked at him like he was a fool or <br/>\nsomething. <br/>\n<br/>\n They DID enjoy the magic show and the whole time I was thinking.. <br/>\nHow much higer math did you learn to do this bit???
