I also wrote an essay for our worker about Unschooling and our style in particular to help her have a better understanding so that she could represent us better to the children&#39;s case workers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had run ins with a few ignorant case workers who refused to even consider us because we homeschool, and that is frustrating, but on the whole I have not run into that many.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sonia Ulan","from":"Sonia Ulan &lt;sulan@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"GGRtbQ-QOWa5_NtQE6hLsOUKGMd0QObMfSbuoMDUbvzccaQN7uT_44Tl5-nzZvBv6ftlFW3RtGRZXT-b8M67QAu4","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] adopting ...","postDate":"961740191","msgId":9756,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5NTJGRDlGLjhEREU0OUY4QGhvbWUuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDAwNjI0MDAxNy5SQUExNDM1OEBtYWlsMTAuYmlnbWFpbGJveC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":9741,"nextInTopic":9789,"prevInTime":9755,"nextInTime":9757,"topicId":9702,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes, show us the picture!","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-180819167\">Yes, show us the picture!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci and Thomas Kuykendall wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;WOW, this is GREAT NEWS!!!<br/>\n&gt; Pris<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, and here is an update.

Apparently, he must have gotten it yesterday, because he had already read it, or at least skimmed it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He said &quot;I got your homestudy, and it looks good.
