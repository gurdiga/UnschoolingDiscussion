I wore braces as a teen and without them I would have looked a little like Dracula, needless to say I&#39;m happy with my adjusted smile. My three kids have all needed work.

My oldest had his eye teeth growing in the roof of his mouth and needed surgery to bring them down but unfortunately this wasn&#39;t noticed early enough and the eye teeth dissolved the root of another tooth it was pushing against and that tooth was lost. It was a mess but it&#39;s all come together all right in the end. As a result of this experience I started my younger two much earlier and their results are great!!! Their ortho used new a new method on them called palatal expansion. The older one had a rapid expander because his growth was already more advanced and the younger one wears a bite-plate that she expands once a week with a little key. These expanders are making possible for them to fit all of their teeth into their mouths in a straight line. The bottom jaw expands naturally to suit the upper, no appliance is needed. Anyway, to make a long story short, shop around until you find a doctor that is up on the latest techniques and satisfies ALL of your concerns. Orthodonture has come a long way in the past couple of years. It&#39;s a big expense and demands thorough research but IMO it is well worthwhile and can save one from lots of trouble in the future.

In the dentist chair for a cleaning and routine checkup ( at about 3and1/2yrs. old,) she was pronounced a definite candidate for orthodontic work.  We&#39;ve been told by more than one professional that she is a &quot;level 2,&quot; (?)  and likely scenarios include the pulling of some baby teeth (should they not fall out soon enough naturally,) braces, retainers, headgear, and possibly the pulling of some permanent teeth if her mouth is crowded. There has been supposition that if she doesn&#39;t have the alteration of her teeth done in a timely fashion, she may require shortening of her jaw bone(!) as an adult, ( necessitating surgery and wiring.) This diagnosis is concerning and distressing  to me, actually more than a little frightening-- I didn&#39;t have braces, and don&#39;t know the ropes (or rubber bands,) so to speak.  My daughter has very clearly made it known that she doesn&#39;t want braces.  My husband and I are of the mind to wait it out...against traditional orthodontic wisdom. I have noticed some wear on her 2 front and center upper teeth (baby ones,) indicating that her present bite does indeed affect the integrity of enamel,etc.  Any counsel?<br/>\nThank-you, Laura.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: k montoya <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, 16 January, 2003 9:56 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: braces<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi, I am a lurker, but I have this experience to share<br/>\n  about this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wore braces for 4 years,starting at 12, same &#39;bite<br/>\n  problem&#39; diagnosis. 4 permamant teeth pulled, about 5<br/>\n  thousand $$$ (which I was very aware of too), headgear<br/>\n  in the DAYTIME sometimes (as ordered--how GEEKY is<br/>\n  THAT?), then visible retainers till 21.
