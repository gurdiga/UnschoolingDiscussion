Wow, I guess <br/>\nthat miracles never cease. <br/>\nStephanie<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Next week, an historic event will take place. On September<br/>\n 16, the<br/>\n United States Senate, by unanimous consent, officially<br/>\n passed Senate<br/>\n Resolution 183, designating the week of September 19-25,<br/>\n 1999, as<br/>\n &quot;National Home Education Week.&quot; This resolution, drafted by<br/>\n and<br/>\n lobbied for by Home School Legal Defense Association, was<br/>\n sponsored<br/>\n by Senator John Ashcroft.<br/>\n <br/>\n Several highlights of the resolution state that: parents<br/>\n have the<br/>\n fundamental right to direct the up-bring of their children;<br/>\n family<br/>\n participation and parental choices in pursuit of educational<br/>\n excellence are important; and training in the home<br/>\n strengthens the<br/>\n family and guides children in setting the highest standards<br/>\n for their<br/>\n lives which are essential elements to the continuity of<br/>\n morality in<br/>\n our culture.<br/>\n <br/>\n Although this resolution does not hold the weight of law, it<br/>\n is an<br/>\n official recognition of home schoolers by our United States<br/>\n Senate,<br/>\n and can be used as powerful tool in public relations.<br/>\n <br/>\n Join us in celebrating this historic event in Washington,<br/>\n D.C. on<br/>\n September 23 and 24, as HSLDA sponsors the Proclaim Liberty<br/>\n Rally and<br/>\n Conference.

Lee, Booker T. Washington, Thomas Edison, Abraham<br/>\n Lincoln,<br/>\n Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Mark Twain, John<br/>\n Singleton<br/>\n Copley, William Carey, Phyllis Wheatley, and Andrew<br/>\n Carnegie;<br/>\n <br/>\n Whereas home school students exhibit self-confidence and<br/>\n good<br/>\n citizenship and are fully prepared academically to meet the<br/>\n challenges of today&#39;s society;<br/>\n <br/>\n Whereas dozens of contemporary studies continue to confirm<br/>\n that<br/>\n children who are educated at home score exceptionally well<br/>\n on<br/>\n nationally normed achievement tests;<br/>\n <br/>\n Whereas a March 1999 study by the Educational Resources<br/>\n Information<br/>\n Center Clearinghouse on Assessment and Evaluation at the<br/>\n University<br/>\n of Maryland found that home school students taking the Iowa<br/>\n Test of<br/>\n Basic Skills or the Tests of Achievement and Proficiency<br/>\n scored in<br/>\n the 70th to 80th percentiles among all the students<br/>\n nationwide who<br/>\n took those exams, and 25 percent of home schooled students<br/>\n were<br/>\n studying at a level one or more grades above normal for<br/>\n their age;<br/>\n <br/>\n Whereas studies demonstrate that home schoolers excel in<br/>\n college with<br/>\n the average grade point average of home schoolers exceeding<br/>\n the<br/>\n college average; and<br/>\n <br/>\n Whereas United States home educators and home instructed<br/>\n students<br/>\n should be recognized and celebrated for their efforts to<br/>\n improve the<br/>\n quality of education:  Now, therefore, be it<br/>\n <br/>\n Resolved, That the week beginning on September 19, 1999, and<br/>\n ending<br/>\n on September 25, 1999, is designated as National Home<br/>\n Education Week.<br/>\n The President is authorized and requested to issue a<br/>\n proclamation<br/>\n recognizing the contributions that home schooling families<br/>\n have made<br/>\n to the Nation.<br/>\n <br/>\n Passed the Senate September 16, 1999<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3004,"nextTopicId":3008}}
