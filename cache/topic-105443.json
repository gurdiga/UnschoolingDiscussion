We","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-544931011\">Hello, I have been emailing with Pam Genant (inspired by her work for the<br/>\nLive and Learn Conference) about setting up a new yahoo group for<br/>\nunschoolers.  We thought it would be a good idea to run it by the readers of<br/>\nthis list, to get your ideas feedback editing and suggestions.  The list<br/>\n(unless someone thinks of a better name) would be called &quot;Unschooling<br/>\nEvents.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDescription:<br/>\nThis is a list dedicated to announcing unschooling events across the United<br/>\nStates.  These events are open to families, or teens who can travel alone,<br/>\nwho want to meet, play and learn with other unschooling families and teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvent Guidelines<br/>\n- All events are geared toward unschoolers.  Anyone is welcome to attend,<br/>\nbut the assumption at all of these events will be that unschooling is the<br/>\noptimal educational option that one could provide a child.<br/>\n- All events will last at least a full day.<br/>\n- When posting an event, the coordinator will provide lodging information<br/>\nfor out-of-town travelers.  This might include unschooling families who<br/>\nwould be willing to host a family or traveling teens.<br/>\n- Event postings will include a contact person and phone number, as well as<br/>\na clear address and directions, to assist people traveling from out of town.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDisclaimer(?)<br/>\n- Obviously, neither Yahoo nor the moderators of this list can accept<br/>\nresponsibility for the safety of your families and teens. Use all of your<br/>\ncommon sense and the normal precautions against sending yourselves or your<br/>\nfamilies to gatherings hosted by people you don&#39;t yet know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we get the list up and running, the hope is that someone from each<br/>\nstate could host one mini-conference or fun-unschooling-gathering, once a<br/>\nyear.  This would giving us all lots of opportunities to network with other<br/>\nunschoolers throughout the year, if and when we have the chance to travel to<br/>\na neighboring (or far flung) state.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105420,"nextTopicId":105451}}
