We don&#39;t play them, and my<br/>\nchildren have no idea what they even are. They&#39;ve never seen one/them and<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t know it if they did. The same with computer games....<br/>\n <br/>\nIt just seems that as they find out about these things on their own, they&#39;ll<br/>\nbe ready to have them in their lives. But, if my child said they would<br/>\nreally like a computer game, or video game, I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to getting<br/>\nthem one either. So, what&#39;s the balance? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sparked some thoughts in me. , about strewing and Unschooling and what<br/>\nhappens if we are leaving children to find out about things &quot;on their own&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrewing is deliberately choosing to make available stuff, activities,<br/>\ngames, technologies, people that the kids might be interested in now or<br/>\nsoon. It is proactive, not passive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose some parents didn&#39;t like horses. They don&#39;t ride them, and they<br/>\ndon&#39;t live in the country. They rarely watch tv, and don&#39;t ever mention that<br/>\nthere is a show called &quot;Mr. Ed&quot; (showing my age), and incidentally don&#39;t<br/>\nhave the Westerns channel.  They don&#39;t go to the petting zoo where there are<br/>\nfoals, or the circus with trick riders, maybe specifically avoiding them, or<br/>\nmaybe just because it never came up. It actually takes work to keep<br/>\nsomething this ubiquitous on the fringes of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy chance the kid, at some older age, happens to make friends with a girl in<br/>\na pony club, and it sparks a fantastic interest. The kid is amazed that<br/>\nthere is this huge culture about horses, and there are games like Barbie<br/>\nHorse Rescue, and it is an Olympic sport, and there is controversy about the<br/>\nevolution of horses, and different riding styles, and a whole culture of<br/>\nclothes and saddles and leather work, and breeds and movies, and the role of<br/>\nhorses in wars and history....and on and on. Connections unlimited. The kids<br/>\nfind out that they have a talent for, or enjoyment of, riding, and maybe<br/>\nfeel resentful that they missed out on years of being part of this culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nComputer/video games are as broad a category as horses - there are lots of<br/>\nvariations, not one homogenous type of game. The experience of unschooled<br/>\nchildren, as described repeatedly on these lists, is so overwhelmingly<br/>\npositive, so full of fantastic learning, skills building, social interaction<br/>\nthrough commonality of interests, connections to other areas of interest,<br/>\nfun, fun, fun. It seems like deliberately withholding knowledge of this is a<br/>\nshame. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling in ACTION. Strew some stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

The only tickets left were $80,  <br/>\neach.  We would have to give up something else we wanted to do (maybe Cedar  Point <br/>\nor the whale watch or something else) in order to be able to afford the  game <br/>\nat Yankee Stadium.  We decided to look at the schedule and see where  else <br/>\nthey might be playing, and it turns out they&#39;re playing in Cleveland 4 days  <br/>\nbefore the conference, and the tickets were only $20 each.  So the natural,  <br/>\nconcrete contraints of limited funds caused me to look for another way to get  <br/>\nwhat I want (to take Will to see the Yankees).  Because *I* am not the one  <br/>\nmaking the decision, but we are being &quot;coerced&quot; by the contraints of money, Will  <br/>\nis not bothered by the fact he won&#39;t be able to see Yankee Stadium, and is <br/>\nhappy  to see them play in Cleveland.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s a real life example.  But I remember the exact example where  this <br/>\nbecame clear to me.  It was the classic &quot;toddler not willing to  get in the car <br/>\nseat&quot;, but mom coerced her into the seat because she had a  doctor&#39;s <br/>\nappointment.  The mom coerced the toddler because of the time  coercion of the doctor&#39;s <br/>\nappointment.  The TCS/NCP adherents would reject  and rebuff that coercion <br/>\nwhich might lead them to coerce their child, by  cancelling the appointment or <br/>\nnot showing up.   Usually my time  coercion issues are not about something <br/>\ninvolving other people, but just a  desire to get something &quot;done&quot; in a reasonable <br/>\namount of time, or, &quot;I&#39;d like to  be in bed by 10:00 tonight because I&#39;m <br/>\ntired, so would you PLEASE come up and go  to bed so I can help you get to sleep?&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nLike Sandra, I don&#39;t believe TCS/NCP is practical.  However, the idea  that <br/>\noutside forces (time, money) can cause me to react in negative way towards  my <br/>\nself and others is simply profound.  I believe the coercion of time  and money <br/>\ncan be removed from most situations.  Even if it can&#39;t, it&#39;s  easier to make <br/>\nhard decisions when what is coercing me is  idenitified.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] peace and love (was something else)","postDate":"1091811417","msgId":97348,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5Zi4yN2YyZWY4OC4yZTQ1MTI1OUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":97347,"nextInTopic":97349,"prevInTime":97347,"nextInTime":97349,"topicId":97193,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/6/04 8:54:22 AM, jnjstau@gvtc.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1009912294\">In a message dated 8/6/04 8:54:22 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jnjstau@...\">jnjstau@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Better for a child (a PERSON) to understand what is best for his body,<br/>\n<br/>\nbut<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to still be able to choose &quot;unhealthful&quot; foods than to eat only what<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>someone<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; else decides is acceptable.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;But again, mom controlling or kid getting all choices aren&#39;t the only two<br/>\n<br/>\noptions.

At first, every thing I read seemed scary and like I was expected to give my child EVERY option under the sun.  I have slowly begun to realize that this is not necessarily the case.  It is allowing my child(ren) to have choices based on the available options while being open to exploring and discovering new options.  At least, that is where my thoughts have evovled to at this point.... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think of it as controlling unless you say &quot;heck no&quot; without any sincere consideration (and darned solid reason) as to why you are saying &quot;no&quot;...  I have learned how to say &quot;yes&quot; and explore things with my daughter.  I have learned a new way of approaching things.  Instead of saying &quot;we can&#39;t&quot;, I am learning how to say &quot;how can we...?&quot;  I think that I am learning just as much as my daughter in this process!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI keep trying to remind myself of the things I want my daughter to learn, see, experience, think, believe, etc...  I want her to be strong, independant, creative, caring, compassionate, and a SMART risk-taker/mistake-maker.  I don&#39;t want her to grow up with the fear, guilt, opression, and anxiety I have experienced in my own life.  To do that, I need to model these things and even change the way I think and look at a problem.    It is sometimes very painful, but a good kind of pain...<br/>\n<br/>\nAli<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

The logical (meaning <br/>\nanalagous, ultimate, parallel, not &quot;sensible&quot;) extension of that would be the <br/>\nidea that a parent would say to a three year old, &quot;Would you rather watch <br/>\nBarney&#39;s Birthday Special or Women of WalMart?&quot;  (Kirby got that for his 18th <br/>\nbirthday from a female friend who works at a video store and thought he would be <br/>\namused.

Experience. If you (a general you, not specificly you) deny them choice you deny them the experience they&#39;ll need later. My daughter  (6)knows from experience that sugary junk food does nothing to satisfy her hunger so she can make informed choices about what to eat when she is hungry. For me, the experience and learning that comes from letting them choose chocolate and cheesies for a lunch will lead to a much healthier lifestyle and attitude down the road.

She knows peanut butter sandwiches are good cavity causers because they sit on her teeth all night and understands that cheese has lots of protein that fills her up. So her bedtime snack choice is usually cheese. Maybe your kids aren&#39;t getting enough credit?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just as I wouldn&#39;t hold up a bottle of formula next to my breast to an infant and expect them to choose, they wouldn&#39;t have the ability yet.

I have 4 kids...7,5,3 and 18 months with baby #5 due in October.<br/>\nFor the last several years I have been learning about Waldorf, and connected<br/>\nwith a Waldorf community locally. There is so much I just love about Waldorf<br/>\nphilosophy, and it really resonates within my soul as truth when I watch my<br/>\nchildren...and of course other parts I totally dismiss :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now that my oldest is 7, and I&#39;m rejecting using any kind of curriculum<br/>\nwith her-including a Waldorf one, I&#39;m diving more into the unschooling<br/>\nworld. What I&#39;m pondering lately is this concept that I keep hearing on this<br/>\nlist that if parents choose to control certain things in their house they<br/>\nare automatically &quot;over controlling&quot; and are doing as SAndra&#39;s post says<br/>\nabove.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are some things that seem &quot;controlled&quot; by the parent, especially<br/>\nwhen kids are as young as mine are, by the simple fact that I make certain<br/>\nchoices for *myself* and therefore this is what my kids are exposed to. For<br/>\nexample, don&#39;t like many sweets, and I definitely see behavior changes in my<br/>\nchildren (no matter what people &quot;talk about&quot;) when they have certain food<br/>\ncolorings and an extraordinary amount of sugar. But, mainly because I don&#39;t<br/>\ncare for it it&#39;s just not in our house much, and my kids don&#39;t really know<br/>\notherwise. They don&#39;t know twinkies exist, not because I wouldn&#39;t allow them<br/>\nto have one, but because I just don&#39;t buy them so they haven&#39;t been exposed<br/>\nto what they are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, if we have cake, ice cream or cookies in our home I would never<br/>\nconsider telling them they couldn&#39;t eat any of it, nor do I try and limit it<br/>\nat all. They get it when they feel like eating some, and they stop when<br/>\nthey&#39;re done. No big deal to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So..this is just one example, but to me this doesn&#39;t feel &quot;controlling&quot; at<br/>\nall. By the simple fact that I do the grocery shopping, I do have some<br/>\ncontrol over what I buy. If anyone in our house has a request, husband or<br/>\nchild, I will do my best to honor their request if money allows. My children<br/>\njust don&#39;t *know* to ask for anything other than what they&#39;ve been exposed<br/>\nto so far.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This example can be taken to media too. I don&#39;t watch much TV at all, and<br/>\nnever do I watch during the daytime as it just doesn&#39;t interest me.<br/>\nTherefore, this is what my children have had modeled for them in their lives<br/>\nand they choose not to watch much TV either. I have never said &quot;no&quot; when<br/>\nthey ask to watch, but after 30 minutes to one hour they are all up and<br/>\nplaying somewhere again. It is rare that they would sit through a movie,<br/>\nit&#39;s like they just get bored with it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t &quot;limit&quot; TV over the years, but I didn&#39;t sit them down with a<br/>\nprogram guide and tell them all of the 599 channels we have to choose from<br/>\neither. So, like my previous example, they only know what we&#39;ve lived and<br/>\nthey have lived with my influence as the caregiver home with them all day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And, I admit, I do have issues with my young children being exposed to<br/>\nmedia (whether it&#39;s TV programs, commercials, etc) that is overly<br/>\ncommercial, sexual, violent or just degrading in general. So, when they ask<br/>\nto watch TV I turn it on a non commercial channel, like PBS or Noggin to<br/>\navoid commercials. OR, I record things on tivo and fast forward through the<br/>\ncommercials (which they like to do anyway). They never, ever, ask for<br/>\n&quot;other&quot; channels...they don&#39;t know they exist really. So, I do not say &quot;no&quot;,<br/>\nbut I&#39;m not exposing them to the whole line-up either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve always not quite fit in with the Waldorf crowd, because in their<br/>\n&quot;opinion&quot; I give my children way too much freedom. Now, I&#39;m beginning to<br/>\nfeel like I don&#39;t mesh with the unschoolers either because I &quot;control&quot; too<br/>\nmuch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One last example would be video games. We don&#39;t play them, and my children<br/>\nhave no idea what they even are. They&#39;ve never seen one/them and wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nknow it if they did. The same with computer games....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It just seems that as they find out about these things on their own,<br/>\nthey&#39;ll be ready to have them in their lives. But, if my child said they<br/>\nwould really like a computer game, or video game, I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to<br/>\ngetting them one either. So, what&#39;s the balance?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am in a good place now, where I&#39;m really thinking about my beliefs and<br/>\nwhat feels right with my children.

By the simple fact that I do the grocery shopping, I do have some control over what I buy. If anyone in our house has a request, husband or child, I will do my best to honor their request if money allows. My children just don&#39;t *know* to ask for anything other than what they&#39;ve been exposed to so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis example can be taken to media too. I don&#39;t watch much TV at all, and never do I watch during the daytime as it just doesn&#39;t interest me. Therefore, this is what my children have had modeled for them in their lives and they choose not to watch much TV either. I have never said &quot;no&quot; when they ask to watch, but after 30 minutes to one hour they are all up and playing somewhere again. It is rare that they would sit through a movie, it&#39;s like they just get bored with it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t &quot;limit&quot; TV over the years, but I didn&#39;t sit them down with a program guide and tell them all of the 599 channels we have to choose from either. So, like my previous example, they only know what we&#39;ve lived and they have lived with my influence as the caregiver home with them all day.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe you&#39;re interpreting the unschooling idea of not controlling as giving them limitless options.

It doesn&#39;t mean you supply them wth every food choice under the sun. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I admit, I do have issues with my young children being exposed to media (whether it&#39;s TV programs, commercials, etc) that is overly commercial, sexual, violent or just degrading in general. So, when they ask to watch TV I turn it on a non commercial channel, like PBS or Noggin to avoid commercials. OR, I record things on tivo and fast forward through the commercials (which they like to do anyway). They never, ever, ask for &quot;other&quot; channels...they don&#39;t know they exist really. So, I do not say &quot;no&quot;, but I&#39;m not exposing them to the whole line-up either. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But the point is that if they asked to watch something different or wanted to watch the commercials, would you respect that choice? BTW, you&#39;ll likely find as I have that an unschooling kid with an active mind is not going to be unduly influenced by a TV commercial.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always not quite fit in with the Waldorf crowd, because in their &quot;opinion&quot; I give my children way too much freedom.

I buy organic, healthy whole foods for many reasons. I believe it is the best way to nourish our bodies (just like I chose breastfeeding my children for the same reason), I like supporting the environment in this way, and frankly it&#39;s a less expensive way to feed our family. Less processed foods, more whole foods. <br/>\n <br/>\nThere are things I choose as a mother when they&#39;re babies, such as unassisted birth, breastfeeding, not vaccinating, cloth diapering, attachment parenting, co-sleeping, etc. I have made all of these decisions after much soul searching and thinking about what, intuitively, feels right for my child. It feels hard just to seemingly throw all of my values aside because my child is some certain age and expect them to understand all aspects and ramification of every decision they make. They can certainly understand a great deal (I see my now 7 yo having great comprehension of these issues) but not as completely as an adult can (when we&#39;re speaking of a 5 or 7 yo versus an adult). <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t expect my kids to understand *why* we eat organic food at their ages (7 and under)....I certainly explain it to them, but I don&#39;t get a sense that they can really and fully grasp an issue such as this at their age, so I make this decision for us. Just as I wouldn&#39;t hold up a bottle of formula next to my breast to an infant and expect them to choose, they wouldn&#39;t have the ability yet. I&#39;ve always felt that through modeling and sharing in non-judgemental ways *why* I make the choices that I do and then allowing them to come into thier own beliefs and choices as they grow seems natural. And allowing them to have different choices and beliefs than I do, this seems key to me too. <br/>\n <br/>\n*BUT*, as a very close knit homeschooling family where I am thier main influence, at their age their choices are limited to what I&#39;ve exposed them too.

I have 4 kids...7,5,3 and 18 months with baby #5 due in October. For the last several years I have been learning about Waldorf, and connected with a Waldorf community locally. There is so much I just love about Waldorf philosophy, and it really resonates within my soul as truth when I watch my children...and of course other parts I totally dismiss :)<br/>\n <br/>\nNow that my oldest is 7, and I&#39;m rejecting using any kind of curriculum with her-including a Waldorf one, I&#39;m diving more into the unschooling world. What I&#39;m pondering lately is this concept that I keep hearing on this list that if parents choose to control certain things in their house they are automatically &quot;over controlling&quot; and are doing as SAndra&#39;s post says above. <br/>\n <br/>\nThere are some things that seem &quot;controlled&quot; by the parent, especially when kids are as young as mine are, by the simple fact that I make certain choices for *myself* and therefore this is what my kids are exposed to. For example, don&#39;t like many sweets, and I definitely see behavior changes in my children (no matter what people &quot;talk about&quot;) when they have certain food colorings and an extraordinary amount of sugar. But, mainly because I don&#39;t care for it it&#39;s just not in our house much, and my kids don&#39;t really know otherwise. They don&#39;t know twinkies exist, not because I wouldn&#39;t allow them to have one, but because I just don&#39;t buy them so they haven&#39;t been exposed to what they are. <br/>\n <br/>\nHowever, if we have cake, ice cream or cookies in our home I would never consider telling them they couldn&#39;t eat any of it, nor do I try and limit it at all. They get it when they feel like eating some, and they stop when they&#39;re done. No big deal to me. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo..this is just one example, but to me this doesn&#39;t feel &quot;controlling&quot; at all. By the simple fact that I do the grocery shopping, I do have some control over what I buy. If anyone in our house has a request, husband or child, I will do my best to honor their request if money allows. My children just don&#39;t *know* to ask for anything other than what they&#39;ve been exposed to so far.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis example can be taken to media too. I don&#39;t watch much TV at all, and never do I watch during the daytime as it just doesn&#39;t interest me. Therefore, this is what my children have had modeled for them in their lives and they choose not to watch much TV either. I have never said &quot;no&quot; when they ask to watch, but after 30 minutes to one hour they are all up and playing somewhere again. It is rare that they would sit through a movie, it&#39;s like they just get bored with it. <br/>\n <br/>\nI didn&#39;t &quot;limit&quot; TV over the years, but I didn&#39;t sit them down with a program guide and tell them all of the 599 channels we have to choose from either. So, like my previous example, they only know what we&#39;ve lived and they have lived with my influence as the caregiver home with them all day.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd, I admit, I do have issues with my young children being exposed to media (whether it&#39;s TV programs, commercials, etc) that is overly commercial, sexual, violent or just degrading in general. So, when they ask to watch TV I turn it on a non commercial channel, like PBS or Noggin to avoid commercials. OR, I record things on tivo and fast forward through the commercials (which they like to do anyway). They never, ever, ask for &quot;other&quot; channels...they don&#39;t know they exist really. So, I do not say &quot;no&quot;, but I&#39;m not exposing them to the whole line-up either. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve always not quite fit in with the Waldorf crowd, because in their &quot;opinion&quot; I give my children way too much freedom. Now, I&#39;m beginning to feel like I don&#39;t mesh with the unschoolers either because I &quot;control&quot; too much.<br/>\n <br/>\nOne last example would be video games. We don&#39;t play them, and my children have no idea what they even are. They&#39;ve never seen one/them and wouldn&#39;t know it if they did. The same with computer games....<br/>\n <br/>\nIt just seems that as they find out about these things on their own, they&#39;ll be ready to have them in their lives. But, if my child said they would really like a computer game, or video game, I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to getting them one either. So, what&#39;s the balance? <br/>\n <br/>\nI am in a good place now, where I&#39;m really thinking about my beliefs and what feels right with my children. Questioning why I do things the way I do, opening up for change. So, I welcome thoughts and comments to aid me in my process. Thanks to you all so much for reading all of this~<br/>\nEspavo,<br/>\nKristina<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] peace and love (was something else)","postDate":"1091766216","msgId":97327,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUzLjEyNzhkOTJkLjJlNDQ2MWM4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":97320,"nextInTopic":97329,"prevInTime":97326,"nextInTime":97329,"topicId":97193,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/5/04 8:01:10 PM, angels_heart82@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2025273140\">In a message dated 8/5/04 8:01:10 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:angels_heart82@...\">angels_heart82@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; If a mom has concerns about<br/>\nthe rainforest why does that make her a jittery wreck.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Many jittery wrecks blame the rainforest or something else entirely out of <br/>\ntheir control and then try to micromanage their children&#39;s lives to make up for <br/>\ntheir free-floating frustrations.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of them are unschoolers, and if someone lists priorities and the child&#39;s <br/>\nhappiness isn&#39;t in the top five or six, I worry.

That would be<br/>\npretty sad.)<br/>\n<br/>\nA mother is a whole person, who not only raises her<br/>\nchild, but also may have concerns about the world her<br/>\nchild is growing up in.  I am not just concerned about<br/>\nthe environment I am raising my child in at home, but<br/>\nalso the world he lives in now and will have to live<br/>\nin as an adult.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Now I see moms intent on world-wide level concerns<br/>\nwhile their kids are just wanting some direct<br/>\ninteraction without being told their interests are<br/>\ndangerous, ecologically unsound, politically <br/>\nincorrect or serving corporate demons.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDirect interaction is about the mom and the child. <br/>\nThat is all that has to be present.  Now if the mom is<br/>\non the phone crusading all the time or spending all<br/>\nher time at rallies and meetings with no time for her<br/>\nkids that would be a bad thing.   <br/>\nI am not a big fan of politically correct, but I would<br/>\ncertainly tell my child if something is dangerous. <br/>\nEcologically unsound?  I would not harp on this until<br/>\nall the joy was sucked out of life, but I would<br/>\ndiscuss my beliefs and feelings about this (although<br/>\nif my child just wanted to cuddle I wouldn&#39;t say let&#39;s<br/>\ntalk about saving the planet instead).  I am not sure<br/>\nwhat a kid might be interested in doing that would be<br/>\necologically unsound.  And corporate demons? <br/>\nConsumerism can be a big problem.  If my child is not<br/>\ninterested in having my values, I would at least like<br/>\nhim to have his own values, not what he has been<br/>\nbrainwashed into thinking from TV commercials whose<br/>\nonly interest is in selling a product.  If a child&#39;s<br/>\nidea of direct interaction with mother is to go to the<br/>\nstore and buy as many toys that were seen on TV as<br/>\npossible, then I guess there could be a problem in<br/>\nmore ways than one.  <br/>\nI am not sure from your comments if you really have a<br/>\nproblem with people who follow a natural diet.  But<br/>\nthis is something I was thinking about in the<br/>\ndiscussion about the three kids who are fighting too<br/>\nmuch and the mom whose little girl has behavior<br/>\nproblems when she eats certain things.  A lot of<br/>\npeople, kids and adults, have food sensitivities<br/>\nand/or food allergies that can cause behavior<br/>\nproblems.  Everyone talks about sugar and<br/>\nhyperactivity, but I have no problem with sugar.  A<br/>\nlot of what people think of having sugar in it<br/>\nactually has corn syrup.  High fructose corn syrup is<br/>\neverywhere and some people have corn allergies (my<br/>\nnephew and I do).  Highly processed snacks and<br/>\nconvenience foods also contain a lot of artificial<br/>\ncolors and flavors and artificial colors in particular<br/>\ncan cause behavior problems.  A change in diet can<br/>\nsometimes make a big difference in behavior.  <br/>\nHere are a couple of web sites:  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.feingold.org/\">http://www.feingold.org/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.foodcanmakeyouill.co.uk/\">http://www.foodcanmakeyouill.co.uk/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.brendasampson.wellington.net.nz/book1/book1-1-3.html\">http://www.brendasampson.wellington.net.nz/book1/book1-1-3.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nDianne in Tacoma, WA<br/>\nWell behaved women don&#39;t make history.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
