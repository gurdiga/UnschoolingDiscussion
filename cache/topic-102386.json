I guess if I stopped to think <br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; it hard, maybe.  There are about 6.000 people in the biggest city near <br/>\n&gt; me.<br/>\n&gt; So that would be more than 20 times the number of people in that city <br/>\n&gt; who<br/>\n&gt; died.

During <br/>\nthe holocaust, the low estimate is 12 million people exterminated.  It <br/>\nseems nature can&#39;t quite do the damage that we, as people are capable <br/>\nof inflicting upon ourselves.  All those big numbers can be hard to <br/>\ngrasp in your mind.  I think it should be hard to grasp - to be able to <br/>\nwrap your mind around that much suffering and distruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really can&#39;t directly tie this to unschooling, just something I <br/>\nthought of when I read the above statement.
