We have since sat down with her and asked about the appeal of school.  Her answer was that her<br/>\nfriends weren&#39;t around , she was envious of their new stuff, and she was just plain curious.  We asked her what we could do to satisfy her curiosity without going to school and together<br/>\nwe came up with a plan.  We will shop for a lunch box (thanks for suggesting this) and school supplies, we will gather her stuff at the table at 9, two days a week, after breakfast and<br/>\nchores are done, and for 1 or 2 hours we will school.  She&#39;s willing to &quot;teach&quot; me, and I said I would &quot;teach&quot; her, we&#39;ll take turns (thanks for this idea too).<br/>\nOur older son is very skeptical about this, but relieved that his sister will not be going to school - he really doesn&#39;t want her there.  This school will last however long it lasts and<br/>\nI&#39;m sure it will be fun.<br/>\nThanks for all your help, I think it&#39;s going to work!  (We are definitely going to the museum for the dinosaurs on the first day of school.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\nto be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best night and day to make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human being can fight and never stop<br/>\nfighting.  e.e. cummings</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] unschooler wanting school","postDate":"1027626051","msgId":39434,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5NjVGREM5LkYyQSVhYnRsZW9AZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjc2MDkyMzcuMTE1MC4zODI0OC5tOUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39435,"prevInTime":39433,"nextInTime":39435,"topicId":39434,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
