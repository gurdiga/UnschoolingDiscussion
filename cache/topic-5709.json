I had hoped to watch the whole thing,<br/>\nbut as we are desperately in need of rain, I won&#39;t complain!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as socialization is concerned, I have a suggestion that has<br/>\nworked great for our dgs (dear grand son!! 6 yo). He attends his<br/>\nSunday School class (since an infant) and children&#39;s church on Sunday<br/>\nmornings (since he was 3), Children&#39;s activities on Sunday evenings and<br/>\non Wednesday he has another children&#39;s activity to attend.  That&#39;s three<br/>\ndifferent groups each week.  He has made friends that he will grow up<br/>\nwith - all attend the same church.  He has grown close to several of the<br/>\nadults - the teachers, helpers, etc. - and I think children do need<br/>\nsome friendships with adults other than family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I have a plus, as there are several members who are school<br/>\nteachers and they seem to be very glad to answer questions I<br/>\nhave regarding how to present different subjects to my dgs.  My<br/>\nown private &quot;support group&quot; - so to speak!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did try a gymnastic class for him, but he felt uncomfortable among<br/>\nchildren and teachers that he did not know.  And,,,he loves to do<br/>\ngymnastics.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy all the list and the sharing that goes on here.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5630,"nextTopicId":5587}}
