My son went through almost 2.5 years of<br/>\ntrains, trains, TRAINS! Including a 4 month period when he would only wear<br/>\nstriped overalls, an engineer hat, and a red bandana, and would only allow<br/>\nhimself to be referred to as &quot;Casey Jones&quot;. He referred to me only as &quot;Sim<br/>\nWebb&quot; (Casey Jones&#39; fireman). Casey was an engineer on a steam train who was<br/>\nkilled in a crash and memorialized in song here in the U.S. for those who<br/>\nare wondering. What we did was just to embrace his passion, and show him<br/>\nways he could follow up on it. When he would ask me a train question I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t answer, I&#39;d say &quot;Well, let&#39;s go look it up in the library&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;Let&#39;s do a search on the internet&quot;. We checked out all sorts of train books<br/>\nand videos, he would pour over the pictures. We got Thomas tracks and spent<br/>\nhours building layouts and playing trains. We bought or checked out albums<br/>\nof train songs (John Denver has a great one, incidentally, terrific train<br/>\nmusic for kids and adults). We listened to Casey Jones and then looked up<br/>\nmore about Casey&#39;s real life. We found a biography on Casey Jones and read<br/>\nabout the real historical person he was. We went to train museums, model<br/>\nrailroad shows, and on train rides. We rode steam trains, diesel trains,<br/>\ntrolleys, light rail, Amtrak, monorails, subways, and elevated trains.<br/>\nEverywhere we went, we found something to do with trains. We found gentlemen<br/>\nof my father&#39;s age and older at all of these events who were train fanatics,<br/>\nvery knowledgeable &quot;grandpa&quot; types who were more than happy to sit down and<br/>\ntalk trains with a young person with a great interest in them. We discovered<br/>\npeople who had been engineers on steam trains themselves, or who just rode<br/>\nthem as young boys. We went to a roundhouse in Portland, OR where they<br/>\nrestore and run gigantic steam locomotives (a Northern and a Daylight, both<br/>\nabout 100 feet long). We created railroad signs at home and talked about<br/>\nrail safety (crossings, etc.). We built trains out of boxes in our living<br/>\nroom. Ultimately, our journey with trains culminated with a summer vacation<br/>\nto &quot;RailFair 99&quot;, the largest gathering of trains in the world, in<br/>\nSacramento, CA. We camped our way down the coast and spent several days at<br/>\nRailFair, looking at gigantic steam trains, sleek electric trains, and even,<br/>\nyes, Thomas!!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see some pictures of some of our excursions (and of our little train<br/>\nfan) at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Dell/8769/locmotive.htm\">http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Dell/8769/locmotive.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYour son might also like this page, I&#39;ve got links to some of the trains<br/>\nwe&#39;ve been on, and lots of train pictures.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this is just to say that you can take any interest and run with it,<br/>\nallow your child to pursue their passions, and they will learn many<br/>\ndifferent things along the way, eventually (IMHO) picking up everything they<br/>\nneed to know. For instance, from our years of train passion, Mackenzie has<br/>\nlearned math - he learned to count and add by figuring out wheel arrangments<br/>\n(which is how trains are classified), he learned about history and<br/>\nbiography, he learned engineering and building (track layouts), and how to<br/>\nwrite (making train signs), and perhaps most vitally, he learned how to find<br/>\nmore information about anything he enjoys, learned how to talk to many<br/>\ndifferent types and ages of people, learned how to use the library and other<br/>\nresources.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, he has now moved on from trains. Now he&#39;s into space and rockets<br/>\n(we just went to the Kennedy Space Center on vacation last month). The boxes<br/>\nin our living rooms are rocket ships, he pretends to be John Glen. He<br/>\nlaunches toilet paper tubes into the air. &lt;Sniff&gt;, I kind of miss the<br/>\ntrains, to tell you the truth.
