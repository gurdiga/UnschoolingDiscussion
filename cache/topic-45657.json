Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime- ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as &quot;Little Chicago.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina&#39;s story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,&quot; Jose Sandoval, author of &quot;Mother Aged 5,&quot; told Reuters.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That&#39;s my fundamental objective,&quot; he added.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;Totally willing to help&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandoval has raised Medina&#39;s case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We&#39;re totally willing to help her,&quot; said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp&#39;s office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family.<br/>\n<br/>\nMedina&#39;s husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. &quot;She got no help (in 1939) that I know about,&quot; he said. &quot;She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters&#39; request for an interview.<br/>\n<br/>\nMedical rarity<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one has ever established who was the father of Medina&#39;s child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru&#39;s poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer swelling stomach worried her parents. &quot;They thought it was a tumor,&quot; he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother&#39;s Day.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World&#39;s Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in &quot;moral danger,&quot; and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Sandoval said: &quot;It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy ending?<br/>\n<br/>\nThough physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse.<br/>\n<br/>\nMedina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body&#39;s bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young.<br/>\n<br/>\nMedina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. &quot;We just want to get on with our lives, that&#39;s it,&quot; said Jurado, adding he thought &quot;absolutely nothing&quot; of the fact his wife was the world&#39;s youngest mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said the couple&#39;s main concern now, if the government&#39;s offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said its value was &quot;more or less $25,000&quot; and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves&#39; paradise.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,&quot; he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina&#39;s story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. &quot;I believe there will be a happy ending,&quot; he said.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45434,"nextTopicId":45641}}
