Our DD","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1529315649\">Well after a lot of reading in this bunch of threads I have decided to<br/>\nadd my story. It&#39;s all about peeling the onion and constant shifts in<br/>\nthinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur DD just turned three, still happily nursing, and we made a conscious<br/>\ndecision from the get-go not to spank under any circumstances, to<br/>\nhomeschool, and a little later not to use punishments, and then more<br/>\nrecently, to unschool forever. We are both 41. I felt I was led on this<br/>\nincreasingly radical path initially by reading some William Sears and<br/>\nJohn Holt. Also &quot;How to talk so your kid will listen...etc&quot;, and &quot;The<br/>\nAware Baby&quot; which talks about compassionately understanding a baby&#39;s<br/>\nneed to cry as communication - this encourages parental behavior that is<br/>\nthe opposite of the abhorrent crying it out theory btw. I read some<br/>\nBrazelton, took on his useful information about the wide range of what<br/>\nis &quot;normal&quot; for infant development, and left behind some of his more<br/>\nconservative &quot;children should learn to be autonomous&quot; stuff. I also read<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s Not Fair, Jeremy Spencer&#39;s parents let him stay up all night&quot;<br/>\nwhich is what first alerted me to the possibility that punishments,<br/>\nconsequences and time-outs were not necessary to child rearing. (I don&#39;t<br/>\nlike his &quot;send them away if they are behaving obnoxiously&quot; concept - and<br/>\nthis list has helped me with alternative strategies there.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the big decisions I made was not to label or perceive what Jayn<br/>\ndoes as being &quot;naughty&quot; or in any way other than **ordinary behavior**<br/>\nfor a little child. This is step beyond what I had already read about -<br/>\nthe fairly standard in childrearing texts notion: Label the behavior as<br/>\nthe problem, not the child. Of course this is better than labeling the<br/>\nchild, but a lot of these ideas can be just strategies for getting a kid<br/>\nto do what you want them to NOW, including go off to school each day. Do<br/>\nyou get that I spent most of my pregnancy/early nursing time reading?<br/>\n<br/>\nSix months ago Jayn just did not want to do something or other. I was<br/>\nfeeling frustrated and angry, and so was she, and I knew that in another<br/>\nfamily there would be spanking by this point. At my wits end I picked<br/>\nher up and gave her a big zerble kiss (a raspberry) on her belly. Well<br/>\nwhatever the problem was evaporated. I was amazed to see my suddenly<br/>\nhappy little girl. It was a &quot;shift&quot; moment that helped me want to look<br/>\nfurther, dig deeper in to how to do this respectful parenting life, and<br/>\nstop and wait when Jayn is doing something that &quot;makes me angry&quot;.<br/>\nBecause the more I go on, the more I realize it isn&#39;t her making me<br/>\nanything, it is **my** reaction that is **my** problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I get that sense that it would be spanking time in another household,<br/>\nthen that is definitely time to show Jayn some love. I am trying to<br/>\ninternalize the NVC process - harder with DH than DD. ;) Even so, I<br/>\nstill get my husband saying to me &quot;you sounded really angry talking to<br/>\nJayn just now&quot;. I guess I sometimes sound angrier than I realize. Thank<br/>\ngoodness he is around to tell me. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhere do I get my notion of &quot;another household&quot;? My mother spanked and<br/>\nscreamed at me my whole childhood, as well as being very controlling.<br/>\nShe didn&#39;t need any tools - her hand was like iron. Later she would come<br/>\nin to my room, crying and apologizing, promising not to hit me again.<br/>\nHow I ranted in whispers in my room of the unfairness of it, waiting and<br/>\nyearning for that late night visit from the penitent. I remember my<br/>\nthroat being sore from not shouting. I screwed up many of my early<br/>\nrelationships, even the ones with nice men instead of controlling<br/>\nabusers, because I needed conflict to feel love. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I try to remember my childhood, I have no memories of my home life<br/>\nor my mother unconnected with crying or pain. I have no idea what I did<br/>\nto spark the spankings. I do remember telling some school friends as a<br/>\nteenager that I had been a naughty child who must have deserved to be<br/>\nspanked. I feel so sorry for that little girl. Today I realize my mother<br/>\nhad unrealistic expectations of a child&#39;s behavior, and her own problem<br/>\nwith uncontrollable rage, and she says nowhere to go for help in those<br/>\ndays (1960&#39;s). <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout ten years ago my mother told me that she had come to realize that<br/>\nshe had been an emotionally abusive parent and she wanted to apologize<br/>\nfor always shouting at me and calling me names. I thought at the time<br/>\nthat I made a decision to forgive her, although I was amazed that she<br/>\nbasically didn&#39;t remember hitting me so much, which was what I<br/>\nremembered. She chose then to reveal that she had been horribly<br/>\nphysically abused all her young life by my grandfather (4 years old<br/>\nbeing beaten with a belt) and caned repeatedly by a school principal in<br/>\na way that is a felony now. Gramps had been abused in his turn by Great<br/>\nGarna as she was called. This bad childhood has been the reason for<br/>\nevery mistake she ever made (even recent ones). Ten years ago, I felt<br/>\nlike it was just another burden of her emotions that I had to carry. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I have my own daughter, I find it is harder for me to feel<br/>\nforgiving, but easier for me to let go of her burdens. I would rather<br/>\navoid her than have to remind myself not to feel responsible for her<br/>\nfeelings about whatever the issue may be. Our conversations are not<br/>\nintimate. She remains often critical and controlling, but speaks so<br/>\nsweetly. Her philosophy is if you nag at someone enough they will do<br/>\nwhat you want them to, for which actions she then takes the credit.<br/>\nSomeone quit smoking? She made them stop. Sometimes her little remarks<br/>\nare like a poison, sifting through my thoughts. What if they are true<br/>\nand she is right? I finally had to say to her, &quot;Are you trying to make<br/>\nme get a divorce?&quot; &quot;No&quot; &quot;Then stop criticizing my husband&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Jayn grows older I frequently have moments of almost out of body<br/>\nschism when I suddenly think &quot;Mum would have hit me if I had been doing<br/>\nthis&quot;. It could be something as simple as making a mess with water.<br/>\nThese realizations make it hard for me to accept her apology in my<br/>\nheart. She said to me, &quot;I felt about you the way you feel about Jayn&quot;.<br/>\nThere must have been something in my face, because her next words were<br/>\n&quot;you don&#39;t believe me&quot;. I don&#39;t. If she had felt the way I do, she<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have done it. A thousand generations of abuse and fury. Well it<br/>\nstops here: the chain is broken. I am the bulwark against the teeming<br/>\nrages of my family history. There is nothing that Jayn could ever do<br/>\nthat would cause me to spank her, or believe she deserved to be spanked.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith gratitude,<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] shift in thinking","postDate":"1035507252","msgId":47866,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxNTBwZlRZU2wxcTRndG9wV2QwMDAwMDE5NkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":47847,"nextInTopic":47932,"prevInTime":47865,"nextInTime":47867,"topicId":47802,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

For those of you who spanked, once you <br/>\ndecided to stop how did you deal with those situations that had caused you <br/>\ntoo spank?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I swatted my first child on the diaper/butt. Her father did spank her <br/>\nonce so hard it left a bruised bottom. I very honestly told him that if he <br/>\never did that again, I would kill him. After that he never laid a hand on <br/>\nher but his words were probably much worse. It wasn&#39;t long after that I had <br/>\nmy revelation and stopped the swatting. Once I make up my mind to stop <br/>\nsomething, it&#39;s always been easy for me to do. Can&#39;t say what I went to was <br/>\nmuch better but I used time outs. I guess more for me than her. Sending her <br/>\nto her room calmed the situation for us both. It took me quite a while to <br/>\nfind that talking and figuring out wher she was really worked best.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Also, was your partner/spouse for or against the idea?

It was really hard. (Not deciding to not spank, dealing <br/>\nwith the situations.) Here is my story. (I&#39;ll try and keep it short.) Darin <br/>\nhad a worse childhood than I so he was never too happy with the idea of <br/>\nspanking to begin with. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was one of those Moms who lightly slapped hands that got into a bowl of <br/>\nfood as it was passed by the child&#39;s seat. I would smack a bottom once with a <br/>\nsharp NO upon finding a child climbing on a counter or getting to close to <br/>\nthe street, or any other transgression. One day, Moly was just about three, <br/>\nJack was still a baby, and she was in the kitchen helping me. I told her to <br/>\nget her stool and climb up so she could help. She just stood there, looking <br/>\nat me. I couldn&#39;t figure out why, so I just repeated myself and said, *if you <br/>\nwant to help, you have to get up here, you are too small to reach even with <br/>\nyour stool* She just looked at me and, with tears in her eyes said, *but you <br/>\nwill spank me.* I had told her NO and spanked her for climbing so often (she <br/>\nwas a climber) that I had really put her little mind in a twist. She wanted <br/>\nto help me, I wanted her to help, she had to get up to my level to help, but <br/>\nhad always gotten in trouble for being in the exact place I was telling her <br/>\nto go to. I made up my mind right then and there not to spank anymore. It <br/>\ntook a long time. Many times I would see her hesitate before doing something. <br/>\nAnd honestly? I never ever thought that a smack on the bottom was any big <br/>\ndeal. I was hit with belts, spoons, paddles, once with a dog chain, once with <br/>\na rubber hose. I thought I was being a good parent. From then on, I took lots <br/>\nof deep breaths, I counted to ten, it was sheer will power to keep from doing <br/>\nsomething that was so ingrained in me. What happened about a year later? Jack <br/>\nwas 2 and ran out in the street, he was inches from being hit by a car, which <br/>\ndidn&#39;t stop, just kept speeding down the street. I ran after him, and just <br/>\nstarted hitting. I must have spanked him 6 or more times. And hard enough <br/>\nthat even with a diaper, he felt it. I was crying, and yelling at him. I <br/>\nshook from fright for an hour after. I went to the bathroom and my hair was <br/>\nsticking up, I was sweaty and flushed. I looked like a mad woman. And my <br/>\nlittle girl came in to me and said, *You hurt my baby! You said you wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhit me, why did you hit my baby?* I try not to think about that. But I did <br/>\nit, and there it is. I hit Moly for just being a normal kid, and I came very <br/>\nclose to beating Jack because of my fear. So I take lots of time before I <br/>\neven talk to my kids, cause I was yelled at a lot as a child. And I just <br/>\nremind myself of all the times I cried in my room after being hit and <br/>\nthinking how much I hated my parents. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117165865,"authorName":"Jennifer Green","from":"&quot;Jennifer Green&quot; &lt;heartlightdfw@...&gt;","profile":"heartlightdfw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] shift in thinking","postDate":"1035497059","msgId":47822,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBiMjEwMWMyN2JhOSQ0ZDdmZGQzMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBzYm1zLnNiYy5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDI0MjEyOTE2LjM2NTkucW1haWxAd2ViMjE1MDYubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47802,"nextInTopic":47847,"prevInTime":47821,"nextInTime":47823,"topicId":47802,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I spanked my child rarely, but I could tell a huge difference when I did.

She would get very angry and scream and she would hit me back when she didn&#39;t get what she wanted, etc.  I decided that I didn&#39;t want that type of anger in my house and I basically decided one day that I would never hit her again.  I just take a deep breath or I give myself a time out to cool off.  It only took about 2 weeks for me to see a difference and I love it.  Now, no one hits or screams.  We all need time out to cool off sometimes, but it&#39;s much more loving.  I just explained to my husband what I had noticed and learned from the experience and he agreed because he could also see a difference in the way the family interacted.<br/>\n<br/>\nJen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi everyone, I have a question.
