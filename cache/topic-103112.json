The  living <br/>\nspaces are often poorly designed for unschooling.  Three or  four bedroom <br/>\nolder houses that have been added onto, or in which the attic was  finished seem <br/>\nto have the best options.  Of course, you might want to  have a bedroom for <br/>\neach kid, but it&#39;s the common areas that matter.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIs there a room that can be a library?  (Better if it has doors that  can be <br/>\nclosed.)<br/>\n <br/>\nIs there a room where projects can be laid out and left there and not  hinder <br/>\nmeals?<br/>\n <br/>\nYou definitely want a house with a living room AND a den.  They  usually have <br/>\nformal dining rooms, too.  My best unschooling house so far  was the one on <br/>\nPenguin Cove.  It had a den, living room, dining room,  breakfast room, <br/>\nsunroom, office, 5 bedrooms and in the middle of all that was a  room that could be <br/>\naccessed from both ends of the house.  That was our  library.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t a brand new house.  It was built in 1979.  Two of the  bedrooms <br/>\nwere added later, in the attic, as was the sunroom (not in the  attic).  It was <br/>\n3000 sq ft, and I looked at other 3000 sq ft homes that  were brand new and <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t have near what this house had as far as usable  space.  They had <br/>\n&quot;great rooms&quot; and gourmet kitchens.  I didn&#39;t need  that.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt was also much more house than I could have afforded in the &quot;nicer&quot;  areas, <br/>\nbut it didn&#39;t matter to be in the &quot;nicer&quot; areas because we&#39;re  <br/>\nunschoolers---GOOD SCHOOLS don&#39;t matter (except for resale, but we sold it for  more than <br/>\nour asking price just 2 years later).<br/>\n <br/>\nMost real estate agents will have a hard time understanding that you don&#39;t  <br/>\ncare how many more bedrooms or that it has all the latest gadgets in the <br/>\nkitchen  or arched windows.  (Who doesn&#39;t want a beautiful house?  But there  are <br/>\ntrade-offs.)  I had to explain it to my realtor every time we saw a  house.  <br/>\nThey want you to think about the schools, but the schools really  didn&#39;t matter <br/>\nto me.  I knew what I wanted. <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t have a great big house anymore.  There are only 3 of us here  now.  I <br/>\ncould have gone and bought a brand new house or a giant house  again.  What I <br/>\nhave now is a 110 year old Victorian in a small town on an  acre lot.  The <br/>\nhouse is only 1500 sq. ft, and it&#39;s layout is divided up  perfectly for being <br/>\nable to shut doors and keep out noise.  The reason I  bought this house over <br/>\nseveral others was because it also has an 1100 sq. ft.  shop and 12x24 <br/>\nstudio--that&#39;s where all the stuff that was in the  library goes.  Plus we have the shop <br/>\nfor doing indoor things like baseball  practice (which we did with sock <br/>\nballs) and working on the cars, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s really good to imagine what you will need and figure out what&#39;s really  <br/>\nimportant to you.  Set a minimum (number of bedrooms and baths, number of  <br/>\nseperate living spaces, size of kitchen, price range, of course).  This  helps <br/>\nyou narrow the field, because it can be mind boggling.  Look  at new AND old <br/>\nhouses.  You should look at all houses that meet  that minimum, no matter what <br/>\narea they are in, because you never know.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOf course, most of this depends on the market in your area and your price  <br/>\nrange!  <br/>\n <br/>\nSorry this is so long.  I&#39;m into house hunting.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102898,"nextTopicId":103053}}
