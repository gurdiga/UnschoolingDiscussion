She is in her room with it right now and she is SO happy- just BEAMING from ear to ear over her emerald green guitar! I&#39;m so glad I took the time to find one in her favorite color (not that it was hard, but I coulda just picked up any old thing, you know?) for her enjoyment! <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Mine is coming on Thursday, and I&#39;m looking forward to sharing this learning to play the guitar process with Sarah! Logan is now saying he wants one, so I&#39;ll look for one for him - his birthday is next month! (I&#39;d been planning on drums for him)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Beth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSing, Dance, Laugh...LOVE!<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBrings words and photos together (easily) with<br/>\n PhotoMail  - it&#39;s free and works with Yahoo!
