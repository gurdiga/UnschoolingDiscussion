One year we compared a 4th grade history text<br/>\nfrom Abeka and a Catholic school text.  It was eye opening to read the same<br/>\nevent from different perspectives.  After the Abeka book chastised the Greek<br/>\nculture for not being Christian.... um.. when Christianity hadn&#39;t been<br/>\ninvented yet, Sara refused to even open the book anymore.  This was an<br/>\neye-opening day for me, because I truly did not know she was reading so<br/>\nclosely.  Remember how we used to read textbooks ---looking for the right<br/>\nanswer to the questions we had to turn in.  Well, it seems without the<br/>\npressure to do that kind of stuff, true critical reading can take place.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"UIxEdJKjDJ2UT6xDo0E40HdUfluJPlG4Lo-10PiLHnZWcCGohiJVCsjCJIvL1vjMxJMMB6JqOBCYJ5FeaFS6kdc-MQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] textbooks and unschooling","postDate":"965709740","msgId":11850,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwODA4MDUyNy5lNzg1UlZBMTgwNTlAc20wMTAxLnByb21lZGlhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":11846,"nextInTopic":11856,"prevInTime":11849,"nextInTime":11851,"topicId":11827,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We have a 1920 s set of encyclopedias and the kidlets love them.  there is a whole section on how to care for babies   All kinds of cute drawings including","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1811961362\">We have a 1920&#39;s set of encyclopedias and the kidlets love them.  there is<br/>\na whole section on how to care for babies &lt;g&gt;  All kinds of cute drawings<br/>\nincluding how to fold diapers and how to give bathes and shows how to use<br/>\nyour elbow to test the water.

I don&#39;t intend to<br/>\never again force her to endure material that bores her, or answer written<br/>\nquestions, or take tests that prove nothing.  But I don&#39;t see why textbooks<br/>\ncan&#39;t be a great source of material as long as they are used in the same way<br/>\nany other book would be used -- to pursue a real interest, and without<br/>\nregard to &quot;grade level&quot;.  And as long as they are part of her resources, not<br/>\nthe whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, to rigidly disregard or dismiss textbooks as a resource would be as<br/>\nbig a mistake as rigidly following them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"burkfamily@aol.com","from":"burkfamily@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"uGbXtdKn5HfkBI9wvIOmTic1q0QqZ6R-On2lCYkkeNxJWGwyMV3ME-wV1D8pC43jvFyGh624uanx","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] textbooks and unschooling","postDate":"965621273","msgId":11827,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEuOTlkNDRhLjI2YmY5MDE5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11835,"prevInTime":11826,"nextInTime":11828,"topicId":11827,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Eiraul wrote:  This sentence brings up a question that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1143136890\">Eiraul wrote:<br/>\n&lt;&lt; The math textbook is often a jumping off place for <br/>\n other subjects, just like anything else we do. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sentence brings up a question that constantly nags at me about <br/>\nunschooling.
