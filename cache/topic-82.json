Just fog, rain, or sunshine and temperatures<br/>\nvaying bewteen 40 some to 70 some.  Anything above or below that is<br/>\nextremely unusual.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I moved away as an adult I had to get a whole new wardrobe.  I had noo<br/>\nsummer clothes, and no winter clothes.  My warmest Jacket was a leather<br/>\nbomber jacket, which did not stand up very well to more extreme winters,<br/>\nand the first place I lived after SF was Albequerque NM so I did not have<br/>\nclothes suitable for that hot weather either.  I have discovered that I do<br/>\nmuch better in cooler or colder weather than in hot.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are relatively new here, having moved permanently in March.  However, we<br/>\ndid go through the winter here in 98, as DH was working in town on a temp.<br/>\nbasis at that time.  Our summers here (in SE Idaho) have about 2 weeks of<br/>\nmoderately hot weather (not breaking 100, usually not breaking 90)<br/>\nsurrounded by pleasant weather.  The winters are cold, but we still don&#39;t<br/>\nhave any snow yet this year, and there is usually not more than a foot or<br/>\nso on the ground here at any one time.  The falls are long and leisurely<br/>\nwith lots of color and the springs are long and punctuated by entertaining<br/>\nstorm cells that whip through on their way to flatter country in Tornado<br/>\nAlley.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are enjoying the &quot;small town&quot; feel here, with a pop. of about 30-40,000,<br/>\nwhich is quite a large drop for me.  We are still finding our social niche,<br/>\nbut are beginning to make friends.  We love the geography, being on a high<br/>\nplateau surrounded by mountains and with the Snake river running throught<br/>\nthe center of town.  We are about 1.5 hrs south-west of Yellowstone and<br/>\ncloser to Grand Teton Natl Park, so have been to both several times since<br/>\nwe moved here.  We actually have quite a few nice ammenities in town, that<br/>\nwe are still discovering.
