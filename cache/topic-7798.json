I respect that that&#39;s how you want to think about it and it sounds <br/>\nterrific to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I would add is that some days my &quot;attitude&quot; is better than <br/>\nothers -- sometimes I am a very relaxed hser, some days not so relaxed, some <br/>\ndays it all works together, some days not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCook or text books -- they are all books to me -- I agree.  But, no matter <br/>\nhow _I_ do it, if I want to call it unschooling (and sometimes I do not <br/>\nbecause I think it just confuses some people when they really only want to <br/>\nhave a pretty surface-y conversation anyway -- like, how&#39;s the hsing going?  <br/>\ngreat.  OK, see you.) on any given day, then I feel free to.  I don&#39;t feel I <br/>\nhave to eschew text or cook books or fit anyone else&#39;s definition in order to <br/>\n&quot;qualify.&quot;  But that&#39;s me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people question a lot of things that I don&#39;t.  Whether &quot;subjects&quot; should <br/>\nbe taught at all, whether &quot;classes&quot; should be taken, what approach those <br/>\nclasses should take, what books are informative and what are too textbook-y, <br/>\netc.  My day-to-day answer to these and other questions is to do what works.  <br/>\nThere is not a big philosophical overlay.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, some people say they have been damaged by their school <br/>\nexperience.  Personally, I don&#39;t feel that way.  But I can see how it can <br/>\nhappen.  But that&#39;s not where I am starting from and so I don&#39;t have some of <br/>\nthe negative reactions to school-y stuff that some people have.  They are <br/>\nright for them and, I think, we are doing right for us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMany, many, many shades of grey (or is it gray? :) ) and they are all OK with <br/>\nme.  And I think if you want to call yourself an unschooler and you are any <br/>\nof those shades, good for you, call yourself whatever you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s something that is too individual to actually define for everyone.  <br/>\nMaybe we can only define it for ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7670,"nextTopicId":7799}}
