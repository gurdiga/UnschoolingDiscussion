I might add that I taught various foreign <br/>\nlanguages through interaction to children for 4 years and I was the <br/>\ndirector of the MetLife Learning Center at a Boys and Girls Club <br/>\nwhere one of my responsibilities was to tutor the ps kids who were <br/>\nhaving problems with reading.  That just strengthened by belief in <br/>\nunschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\nReading Acquisition<br/>\n<br/>\n     I don&#39;t know how my children learned to read.  I certainly <br/>\ndidn&#39;t teach them in the traditional sense nor did I look closely <br/>\nenough at the process to see exactly what was happening as they were <br/>\nlearning.  As an unschooler, someone who trusts in a child&#39;s ability <br/>\nto learn, I just know that at three different ages my older children <br/>\nbegan to read.   <br/>\n<br/>\n     Now my fourth and youngest child is learning to read.  As I <br/>\nobserve her, I realize that she is also progressing without <br/>\nanyone &quot;teaching&quot; her.  When I began noticing how she was learning to <br/>\nread, I didn&#39;t have a grasp of or a word for the whole process.  I <br/>\ntoyed with different terms and phrases such as &quot;discovering reading&quot; <br/>\nbut none of these seemed right.  I finally found the word I needed <br/>\nquite by accident.  <br/>\n<br/>\n     As I was searching for quotes that demonstrated how children <br/>\nacquire their spoken language, I found a study that described the <br/>\ninteraction involved with acquiring language. The process was exactly <br/>\nlike the process I was observing in my daughter as she began to <br/>\nread.  She was &quot;acquiring&quot; reading.  And why not?  Reading is simply <br/>\nwritten language.<br/>\n<br/>\n     We don&#39;t need to &quot;teach&quot; our babies to talk.  Human beings, <br/>\nbarring any great disability, are &quot;hard wired&quot; for language.  Grammar <br/>\nisn&#39;t taught by understanding rules and memorizing exceptions.  Verbs <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to be conjugated in any tense.  If we were to try to teach <br/>\nchildren their primary language in this way, language acquisition <br/>\nwould undoubtedly be stunted.  Language, including rules of grammar <br/>\nand the meaning of words, is assimilated as children interact with <br/>\npeople who are using spoken language.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    My experience has led me to believe that reading, just like <br/>\nspeaking, is an innate ability of human beings.  Reading begins when <br/>\nthe level of mental and physical development is reached that allows <br/>\nthe assimilation of written language rather than any specific <br/>\ninstruction the child is given as long they are exposed to a literate <br/>\nenvironment.  Instruction in reading may at times hinder this natural <br/>\nprocess making reading seem difficult.  Children learn to read <br/>\ndespite, rather than because of, instruction.  <br/>\n<br/>\n     Although children cannot learn to read if they are isolated from <br/>\nreading, they do learn to read by interaction with others.  Educators <br/>\nalready know that reading to a child will help guarantee reading <br/>\nsuccess.  They attribute this to the example that the parent is <br/>\nsetting.  But could it possibly be that this reading time, even <br/>\nbefore the child starts &quot;learning&quot; to read, is the foundation for the <br/>\ninteraction necessary for reading acquisition?<br/>\n<br/>\n     So how does a child &quot;acquire&quot; reading through interaction?  <br/>\nThere are many ways and one of the problems with &quot;teaching&quot; reading <br/>\nis that some of these methods get pushed to the side.  Allowing <br/>\nchildren access to adults who will read to them, answer their <br/>\nquestions and support them in their endeavors will cover all the <br/>\nbases of reading acquisition.<br/>\n<br/>\n     These are some of the processes that I have noticed as I&#39;ve <br/>\nobserved my daughter:<br/>\n<br/>\n     Asking what a word says.  This is not unlike the &quot;look-see&quot; <br/>\nmethod that has fallen out of favor though it is less formal.  It <br/>\ndoes, however, have its merits.  Every parent has been asked by their <br/>\nchild what a word says.  If by listening to whole sentences, children <br/>\ncan grasp the rules of grammar then there are also ways to start to <br/>\ngrasp the rules of reading by being told what a word says.  I have <br/>\nnever made my children sound out words when they asked what a word <br/>\nwas.  Many times they have repeated a word slowly after being told, <br/>\nfollowing the letters as they say the word.  This actually seems a <br/>\nvery pleasurable activity for them and goes against conventional <br/>\nbeliefs- the word is read and then the child sounds it out on their <br/>\nown.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Asking what sound a letter makes.  This is informal phonics and <br/>\nalso has a place in reading acquisition.  No one can deny that the <br/>\nletters correspond with sounds and that those sounds are the clue to <br/>\nthe meaning of what is written.  It is when we only concentrate on <br/>\nletters that we don&#39;t allow children to learn the exceptions <br/>\nnaturally. Children seem more interested in words than letters when <br/>\nthey begin exploring written language.  This is just the opposite of <br/>\nhow reading through phonics is taught but it makes more sense.  Words <br/>\nhave meaning; letters do not.  As children search out meaning they <br/>\nare going to look for the method that brings that meaning into focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Reading what a child already knows.  Children often read through <br/>\na book that they&#39;ve memorized because someone else has read it to <br/>\nthem over and over.  I watched as my children read through their <br/>\nscripts for the many plays they did and, even though the words were <br/>\ncompletely memorized, they read slowly, sounding out the words and <br/>\nabsorbing the rules of reading.  Sometimes they would ask for help <br/>\nwith a word that they were stuck on even though the entire passage <br/>\nwas memorized.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Real life reading.  Much of the way we use writing in real life <br/>\nis not in book form.  Shopping lists, quick notes to tell someone we <br/>\nlove them, the entertaining comics in the newspaper or phone messages <br/>\nare all good examples.  Our society is a literate one and a child who <br/>\nis allowed a fulltime place in the real world will be surrounded by <br/>\npositive and useful reading experiences.  ***Unfortunately, the <br/>\nschool classroom is one of the most literarily sterile environments <br/>\nthere is.  Perhaps this explains why there is a problem with teaching <br/>\nreading in the schools.***<br/>\n<br/>\n     Writing.  Children have a strong urge to communicate.  They love <br/>\nto their write names and their friend&#39;s names as well other words <br/>\nthat have meaning to them.  By giving them plenty of writing tools <br/>\nand paper they will explore written language all on their own.  <br/>\nThrough this process, the whole reason behind written language <br/>\nbecomes obvious.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Treating reading mistakes positively. An observation by one <br/>\nlinguist struck me as interesting.  Adults tend to accept or treat <br/>\npositively mistakes that young children make in speech.  One of the <br/>\nsentences that was used as an example was &quot;There&#39;s a tree-knocker <br/>\noutside.&quot;  When a small child makes this mistake we will either let <br/>\nis pass (&quot;Oh, yes there is!&quot;) because the important part of this <br/>\ncommunication is the excitement of a bird and the name doesn&#39;t matter <br/>\nor we will use the word properly (&quot;Oh, yes!  A woodpecker.&quot;) to set a <br/>\ngood example without correcting the child&#39;s speech.  I have always <br/>\ndone the same with my children as they read to me.  The mistakes <br/>\nweren&#39;t as important as the words they read correctly.  Frequently, <br/>\nas they progressed through the story, their mistake became apparent <br/>\nto them and they corrected it themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n       My children are by no means the only ones I know who have been <br/>\nallowed to learn to read.   Based on my experiences with dozens of <br/>\nchildren who were not &quot;taught&quot; to read yet became fluent readers, I <br/>\nhave found that the age at which this innate ability comes into play <br/>\nto vary widely.  I was reading at the age of four even though I had <br/>\nnot received any formal instruction.  My children have all become <br/>\nreaders at ages varying from six to 11 years old.  Just as babies <br/>\nbegin to walk and talk at different ages, children will learn to read <br/>\nat different times.  <br/>\n<br/>\n     The former governor of my state, now president of the country, <br/>\ndeclared that all children will be reading at the age of eight but <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean that those children will be capable of reading.  To <br/>\ndeclare such nonsense will only frustrate children and teachers as <br/>\nwell as create more problems that add to the myth that learning to <br/>\nread is a difficult process.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":127152010,"authorName":"hollyfurgason","from":"&quot;hollyfurgason&quot; &lt;unschooler@...&gt;","profile":"hollyfurgason","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Reading question ?","postDate":"1062220752","msgId":79478,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJpcGM0ZytxM2xlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDMwODI5LjIxMTcwMi4zMjYwLjExLmZyZWVmb3JtQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":79474,"nextInTopic":79479,"prevInTime":79477,"nextInTime":79479,"topicId":79426,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes, *even* phonics, the Holy Grail of literacy. :-) Holly (mom to four untaught late readers)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1182949581\">Yes, *even* phonics, the Holy Grail of literacy. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly (mom to four untaught late readers)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, freeform@j... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Sat, 30 Aug 2003 04:03:21 -0000 &quot;hollyfurgason&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;unschooler@s...&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Even  phonics can fail in the classroom.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *Even* phonics?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; dar </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2294225,"authorName":"freeform@juno.com","from":"freeform@...","profile":"freeform_ca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Re: Reading question ?","postDate":"1062217022","msgId":79474,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwODI5LjIxMTcwMi4zMjYwLjExLmZyZWVmb3JtQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":79472,"nextInTopic":79478,"prevInTime":79473,"nextInTime":79475,"topicId":79426,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Sat, 30 Aug 2003 04:03:21 -0000 hollyfurgason ... *Even* phonics? dar","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1739595612\">On Sat, 30 Aug 2003 04:03:21 -0000 &quot;hollyfurgason&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooler@...\">unschooler@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Even  phonics can fail in the classroom.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*Even* phonics?<br/>\n<br/>\ndar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":127152010,"authorName":"hollyfurgason","from":"&quot;hollyfurgason&quot; &lt;unschooler@...&gt;","profile":"hollyfurgason","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Reading question ?","postDate":"1062216201","msgId":79472,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJpcDdtOStkcWl2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJpbnF2aytjMm85QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":79456,"nextInTopic":79474,"prevInTime":79471,"nextInTime":79473,"topicId":79426,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... adulthood ... lady s ...

I was fortunate to learn to read at a time when *Whole <br/>\nLanguage* was popular, I was able to combine sight words AND phonics, which worked <br/>\ngreat for *me.*  I know the pendulum has swung aaaallll the way over to a <br/>\n*Phonics Only* approach as of late, and as I don&#39;t see English as a phonetic language <br/>\n(unlike Spanish, for example), this approach would not work for me ~ the <br/>\nwoman who claimed to really enjoy &quot;Choppin&#39;s&quot; music (I had only *heard* the name <br/>\nChopin, never read it, so I had no idea this word meant &quot;Show-pan&quot;), as an <br/>\nadult, in front of other adult educators.  Had I been a child, the humiliation <br/>\nalone would have stopped my desire to speak out.  There are so many examples of <br/>\nthis in our hodgepodge language, I think it is a disservice to children, or <br/>\npeople of any size, to expect them to know when to apply phonics and when not to, <br/>\nif that is all they&#39;re offered.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(scooting my soap box off to the side &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, too, that children *do* learn what is important for them in their <br/>\nlives at that moment.

She has made friends with the lady who runs the concession <br/>\nstand at the swimming pool.

(I like phonics. <br/>\nPlease don&#39;t jump me on this.) So I visited with the phonics teacher, <br/>\nand thought her phonics program was pretty impressive (maybe I like <br/>\nphonics because I like analyzing things, breaking things down to <br/>\nminute details...maybe that&#39;s it...) <br/>\n<br/>\nThe phonics teacher told me that she tutors adults. 18 to 68 year <br/>\nolds who haven&#39;t ever learned to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I know what this list would think of pushing the reading w/the <br/>\nphonics program, no matter HOW much I like it &lt;G&gt; This is what you <br/>\nwould say &quot;She&#39;ll pick up the reading.
