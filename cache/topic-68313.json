It&#39;s on righ now, here, and <br/>\nthey are talking about homeschoolers.  The family shown did the whole report <br/>\ncard thing, etc. but it was interesting, to say the least.  During the round <br/>\ntable, the kids were discussing homeschooling and I swear one of those <br/>\ngirls, for sure, had to have been coached  as to what to say.  She talked <br/>\nabout friends and the whole socialization scare.  Although one boy did say <br/>\nhe wasn&#39;t a big fan of school and how cool it would be to be able to wake up <br/>\nand go, &quot;Hey Mom, I saw this really cool thing on tv last night and I&#39;d like <br/>\nto learn more about it!&quot;  There was a lot of discussion focused on the extra <br/>\nattention children get.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m blabbing, but was interested if any of you happened to catch it.  My <br/>\nkids came and got me to tell me about it, so I ran in and we watched it <br/>\ntogether!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68297,"nextTopicId":68326}}
