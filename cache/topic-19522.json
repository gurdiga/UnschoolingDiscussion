That annoyed me (as an<br/>\nEnglish teacher, at the time)because it implied that<br/>\nreading was a chore while TV was enjoyable. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd THAT reminded me of the woodshop teacher who used<br/>\nto make the students WRITE for a punishment.I went to<br/>\nhim and asked if he would like it if I had the<br/>\nstudents saw and pound nails for punishment.He just<br/>\nacted like I was a freak for thinking pounding nails<br/>\nwasn&#39;t fun. I told him he was implying to the kids<br/>\nthat writing wasn&#39;t fun. He was compeletely baffled<br/>\nand clueless about my objections. SIGH!
