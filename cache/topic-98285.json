But my opinions as a <br/>\nchild were not valid, and I knew it, so I kept my opinion to myself and stuffed <br/>\naway. My max weight as a 5&#39; 11&quot; adult was 335lbs. It took my husband telling me <br/>\nfor YEARS that I didn&#39;t have to finish something (ESPECIALLY at a <br/>\nrestaruant-where I&#39;d paid &quot;good money&quot; for the food on my plate) for me to really get it. <br/>\nI&#39;ve also realised as an adult that my parents&#39; attitude also put far more <br/>\nvalue on the &quot;sweet&quot; than it should-and I still haven&#39;t gotten over that, yet.<br/>\nI find it really easy to avoid the &quot;starving children&quot; aspect with Wyl. Its <br/>\nalmost a rebellion thing-I get a HUGE thrill out of saying, &quot;You&#39;re done with <br/>\nyour meal-you just don&#39;t want any more? Well, that&#39;s fine. Yes, you can have <br/>\nsome cookies.&quot; My parents looked stunned at me, exchange &quot;the look&quot; with each <br/>\nother, and get that whole attitude that I&#39;m ruining a perfectly good boy. And <br/>\nI&#39;m smug in my assurance that I&#39;m helping him to learn how to make his own <br/>\nchoices and be a great man, someday! :~) He will often walk away from the table for <br/>\n20 minutes or so, anyway, and be hungry again, and come back and eat the rest <br/>\nof his meal-no questions asked, no begging for more cookies. He&#39;s hungry and <br/>\nthe food was good, so he eats it. I&#39;m afraid, though, that I do pass along <br/>\nsome of that &quot;extra value&quot; on the sweets to him, though.... Hopefully, as I come <br/>\nto terms with this, my input will lessen, and since he most likely won&#39;t have <br/>\nthe food issues I did/do (cleaning the plate or be selfish and wasteful), <br/>\nmaybe the sweet won&#39;t hold as high a value for him-and maybe he&#39;ll be able to get <br/>\nthrough it easier.

Good for you, Andrea!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennefer--this is exactly how unschooling happens. More, more, more <br/>\nmoments like this and before you know it, you&#39;re unschooling like all <br/>\nthese experienced folks with older kids. At least, that&#39;s how I think it <br/>\nhappens. ;)  Focus on more moments like this in your home. When you say <br/>\n&quot;no,&quot; ask yourself &quot;why no?&quot; No&#39;s are a very vague thing that tend to be <br/>\nmuch more about the parent than the child. Instead of saying no, try to <br/>\nidentify *specifically* what *you&#39;re* concern is. For example, instead <br/>\nof saying &quot;no,&quot; say &quot;I&#39;m concerned that x might happen.&quot; Then your child <br/>\nhas specific information to make a decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis applies even with little children and something as basic as <br/>\ncrossing a street or parking lot safely. My youngest *never* wanted to <br/>\nhold my hand. I&#39;ve had to revamp, become very creative and minimize <br/>\ncontrols with him in ways I never had to worry about with my first two. <br/>\nWith Sam, I would tell him that my biggest job was to keep him safe and <br/>\nholding his hand let me know he was safe, but if he could let me know he <br/>\nwas safe in another way that would be okay, too. He has been walking by <br/>\nmy side within grabbing distance and eye shot for at least 2 years--he&#39;s <br/>\n4 now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about that through the whole back and forth over age <br/>\nappropriateness. My kids have always seemed quite capable even at the <br/>\nage of 2. In fact, it always surprises me when I look back at pictures <br/>\nand think, my goodness they look like such babies, because I never <br/>\nremember thinking of them that way. They were always people to <br/>\nme--people who needed my help to enable them to problem solve in a big <br/>\nworld. Most of the stuff they couldn&#39;t do or couldn&#39;t get I always <br/>\nfigured was because the world wasn&#39;t the right size, not that they <br/>\nweren&#39;t old enough. I can remember imagining what it would be like if I <br/>\nwalked around in a world where everything was at least two times too big <br/>\nfor me, too high, too heavy. Kind of like Jack in the Giant&#39;s world, you <br/>\nknow?  Probably, for me, it was reading Montessori, but I can remember <br/>\nback in college when I worked in the World Bank Daycare Center, and my <br/>\nfavorite room to work in was the 2&#39;s because they were so incredibly <br/>\namazing (and with much less attitude than the 5s and 6s!). With the 2s <br/>\nyou could show them something one time and they picked it up; it was <br/>\njust new to them. Kind of like having a visitor from another country: <br/>\nI&#39;m just the ambassador and facilitator--they&#39;re not stupid or <br/>\nincapable. I&#39;m not saying anyone here thinks young kids are stupid or <br/>\nincapable, but there are lots of folks out in the world who seem to <br/>\ntreat them that way and make money by perpetuating that idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m rambling again.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.htm.\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.htm.</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185471567,"authorName":"Andrea Burlingame","from":"&quot;Andrea Burlingame&quot; &lt;aburlingame@...&gt;","profile":"raineeday66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Cost of &quot;toys&quot;   was: The Gimmes","postDate":"1092812944","msgId":98285,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxYmMwMWM0ODRmMiQzZmUzMDA5MCQyOWFlY2VkMUBoZXJvbm9mZmljZT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM0ODJlMCQzOWM0MDc5MCQyNDBjMDAwYUB5b3VyMndwMjFuM296Nz4gPDQxMjEyMTM5LjkwOTA2MDVAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+IDwwMDViMDFjNDg0NDgkMmIyM2UxNjAkODM0Y2RlMThAYW9sZHNsLm5ldD4gPDYuMS4yLjAuMC4yMDA0MDgxNzEyNDEyNi4wMjZjOTNkMEBzbXRwLm1hYmIubmV0PiA8MDA1ZTAxYzQ4NDk0JGE3OWIxMDAwJDZlNTY2NDQ0QGRjLmRjLmNveC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":98313,"prevInTime":98284,"nextInTime":98286,"topicId":98285,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Betsy said: ==I ve had to shift this to non-toy items, too.

It&#39;s not<br/>\nwaste, it *is* value!==<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI *finally* got this about transparent tape.  My kids love the stuff and I<br/>\nused to cringe and suggest they save some for another potential craft<br/>\nproject or whatever.  But since I&#39;ve been reading this list, I&#39;ve been<br/>\nquestioning all my &quot;no&#39;s &quot; and becoming more aware of the way I try to<br/>\ncontrol things, so I questioned why it was so bad for them to use up the<br/>\ntape and came to the conclusion that it&#39;s not.  The dollar store sells it<br/>\ncheap, and they are endlessly entertained--Spent 5 bucks, give them 4 rolls,<br/>\nput aside one for myself and have one less thing to monitor/worry about!.<br/>\nDUH!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Andrea</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98829,"nextTopicId":98823}}
