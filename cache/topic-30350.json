I&#39;m pretty much letting them find out for themselves.  I <br/>\nlet them visit her whenever they want to which is becoming less and less <br/>\nfrequent.  That&#39;s their choice.  There are lots of cool and interesting <br/>\nthings about my mother I can talk to them about and that&#39;s what I <br/>\nconcentrate on.  I never bring up the bad stuff.
