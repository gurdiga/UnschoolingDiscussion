In addition to being an unschooling mom and sometime Conference  <br/>\nDiva, I am a Director of Religious Education at a Unitarian Universalist <br/>\nchurch.  I am planning a program for church, and wanted to talk about Charles <br/>\nFollen, who  was a Unitarian minister and is credited with (at least publicly) <br/>\nbringing the  tradition of Christmas trees to the US. You can find this story <br/>\nhere: _The Follens and the  Christmas Tree | Follen Church Society_ <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://follen.org/?q=FollenChristmasTreeHistory)\">http://follen.org/?q=FollenChristmasTreeHistory)</a>  <br/>\n <br/>\nIn looking for information, I found this tidbit:<br/>\n <br/>\nBy 1834 Follen, who was coming up for the equivalent of tenure at Harvard,  <br/>\nwas a confirmed and uncompromising abolitionist. &quot;But radical abolitionism did  <br/>\nnot sit well with most Northerners, even with the Boston Unitarian  <br/>\nestablishment, whose members were offended by what they regarded as its vulgar  style <br/>\nas well as its constant insistence that abolition be total and  immediate.&quot; <br/>\nHarvard did not renew Follen&#39;s contract in 1835. Fortunately, his admirers  <br/>\nfound him a salaried position directing the education of two children whose <br/>\nrich  merchant father had died in Boston. <br/>\nUnfortunately, Follen proved to be a radical in education too. He believed  <br/>\nthat education, instead of drilling lessons by rote, should draw out the  <br/>\ncharacter and energies already present in a child&#39;s young soul. These  progressive <br/>\nideas, Nissenbaum relates, represented &quot;the kind of approach that  struck many <br/>\npeople (including many Unitarians) as leading inevitably to an  <br/>\nindiscriminate parental indulgence of children in their immature desires and  whims.&quot; <br/>\nAs his detractors apparently maneuvered against him, the abolitionist  <br/>\neducator and staunch Unitarian stuck to his principles - and lost his job only  <br/>\nweeks before Christmas of 1835. <br/>\n&quot;Through these trying hours, as always,&quot; writes Nissenbaum, &quot;Follen  <br/>\nmaintained his characteristically calm, patient demeanor, but he did not retreat  a <br/>\nsingle inch. He was a man of extraordinary principle and tenacity.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110757,"nextTopicId":110755}}
