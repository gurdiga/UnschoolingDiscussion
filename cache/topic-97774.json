But I can comment on<br/>\nthe idea of passing on the idea of souls choosing the life they lead onto a<br/>\nchild.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see that it could be healing for an adult who is out of an abusive<br/>\npast to look at the positive that came out of it and embrace the idea that<br/>\nthey chose to live through that in order to learn what they did. (Or even<br/>\naccept that their soul learned something that they may not be able to<br/>\nunderstand until after death.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for a child who is living a life of abuse -- from parents who think they<br/>\nare being good parents -- it could just add to the burden she&#39;s bearing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s romantic to think of a happy child who loves her life being presented<br/>\nwith the idea that she chose the parents she did. But it&#39;s short sighted not<br/>\nto take into account the effect on children who are leading rotten lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning something from a bad experience doesn&#39;t justify the bad experience<br/>\nor the existence of bad experiences. There are far too many people suffering<br/>\nthrough bad experiences who will end up damaged and pass that damage on to<br/>\nothers to suggest that because good can come from bad, that there must be a<br/>\ngood reason for bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86181566,"authorName":"jennefer harper","from":"jennefer harper &lt;jenneferh2000@...&gt;","profile":"jenneferh2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Children&#39;s Books/Memories Was: on being judgemental...","postDate":"1092246842","msgId":97774,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwODExMTc1NDAyLjI1ODUucW1haWxAd2ViMTEzMDUubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":97788,"prevInTime":97773,"nextInTime":97775,"topicId":97774,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/11/2004 4:42:28 AM Eastern Daylight Time, kkahney@yahoo.com writes: (he has  a great children s book called Little Soul and the Sun that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1550998334\">In a message dated 8/11/2004 4:42:28 AM Eastern<br/>\nDaylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kkahney@...\">kkahney@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n(he has  a great children&#39;s book called &quot;Little Soul<br/>\nand the Sun&quot; that <br/>\nis <br/>\nabout exactly  this idea of children choosing their<br/>\nlife circumstances <br/>\nbefore <br/>\nthey enter,  good or bad.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThere&#39;s a CHILDREN&#39;S book????<br/>\n <br/>\nNow, see, THAT&#39;s bad. Sure---adults who want to<br/>\nbelieve that their <br/>\nchildren  <br/>\nchose them is fine. But to put all that on a CHILD? I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think <br/>\nthat&#39;s  good.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, what&#39;s so bad about having a children&#39;s book<br/>\nabout it?  I think we should all read the book before<br/>\ncriticizing it;  even if we are biased about the<br/>\ntopic.  There are lots of children&#39;s book I don&#39;t<br/>\nlike, but that doesn&#39;t mean I think they shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\navailable.  For example, all those children&#39;s books<br/>\nabout mommy having another baby.  Most all of them are<br/>\nstories about mommy going to the hospital or bottle<br/>\nfeeding the baby.  I don&#39;t necessarily think they&#39;re<br/>\n&quot;BAD&quot;, I just don&#39;t choose them to read to my child in<br/>\nhelping to explain birth. (We homebirth and<br/>\nbreastfeed.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there are a ton of children&#39;s religious books. <br/>\nJust because I&#39;m not a practicing Christian doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmake me think they&#39;re &quot;BAD&quot;.  Yes I cringe at the<br/>\nsight of them and no I wouldn&#39;t choose one to check<br/>\nout for my child from the library, but at least they<br/>\nare available for children who do have an interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalking to my partner about the idea of whether or not<br/>\na child picks his parents before being born into this<br/>\nworld- even choosing to be born into bad circumstances<br/>\nlike to parents who abuse them, he shared that he has<br/>\nan early childhood memory- one of his firsts, of being<br/>\ngiven the choice of what type of life he wanted to be<br/>\nborn into.  What parents he wanted to be born to.<br/>\n*Ohmigosh!* Great, I thought, there goes my theory.  I<br/>\nwas shocked and intrigued to hear him say that his<br/>\nearliest memory was being in a conversation with<br/>\nsomeone and being given the choice of a few different<br/>\ntypes of lives to be born into.  He told me that he<br/>\ntold this &quot;being&quot; that he wanted an easy life this<br/>\ntime around and wanted to live in the US.  So it be.<br/>\n(?) No, my partner is not crazy.  Yes, he is eclectic<br/>\nand has traveled to India several times and has hung<br/>\nout with the Dali Lama and other teachers.  But, I<br/>\nhave to believe him, right?  But, how to make sense of<br/>\nthis?  I asked him, what about an innocent child<br/>\nchoosing to be born to parents who<br/>\nmentally/physically/sexually abuse him/her and kill<br/>\nthem?  Do you think someone would choose that?  And<br/>\nwhy?  He says, they are probably give the choice of a<br/>\nfew lives and they may or may not pick the better one.<br/>\n That some people may only choose to be on this earth<br/>\nfor a short time.  That some people need to learn<br/>\nsomething and through those experiences, that&#39;s how<br/>\nthey learn what they need to learn to move on.  I<br/>\nsaid, what about a little baby who gets killed?  What<br/>\ndo they learn from that?  He says, well,<br/>\ncontemplation. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess to make a long story short, I mainly<br/>\nwanted to share this story, which makes me wonder if<br/>\nthere are other children out there who do remember<br/>\ngiven the choice of parents to be born to?  And, how<br/>\ncan this be explained if it is not a fact?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jennefer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
