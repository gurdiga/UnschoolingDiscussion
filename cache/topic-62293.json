I think alot of it just has to do <br/>\nwith showing affection, being open and comfortable with each other.  My 13 yo <br/>\ndaughter  snuggles and hugs and loves up to me all the time. My 11 yo son <br/>\nwill sit on my lap for while..Well, rather in my knee.  He&#39;s 110 pounds, so <br/>\nhe doesnt really &quot;fit&quot; on my lap.  I still carry my 7 yo old lots of times.. <br/>\nTo and from the car... .carry him to bed.  I pick him up and hold him on my <br/>\nhip very often, lift him up to see stuff.  It not unusual for me to take a  <br/>\nspooned up nap with any ( or a combination of ) them.  My big old 16 yo son <br/>\nwhose bigger than me gets hugs, and affectionate pats often too.   We are all <br/>\nvery touchy-feely.. My family was very openly affectionate as I was growing <br/>\nup and we still are.  ( My parents, sisters and now my nieces and nephews)  I <br/>\nthink its wonderful <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"gruvystarchild","from":"&quot;gruvystarchild&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"peer pressure","postDate":"1048866767","msgId":62293,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI2MXI0ZitlampmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":62334,"prevInTime":62292,"nextInTime":62294,"topicId":62293,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A kid over 10 in his/her parent s lap is a rare, and beautiful, thing to see.
