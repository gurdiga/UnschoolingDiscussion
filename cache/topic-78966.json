Nobody&#39;s ever forced anyone else to look <br/>\nup or care, but we&#39;ve had LOTS of times when other people were over too, and <br/>\nmost or all would go out and let Keith tell them what was cool to see that <br/>\nnight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve driven 50 miles to get past clouds to see meteors and moonrises.
