The information that the child is alright in feeling<br/>\nthis way is important for the mother to know.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought there were excellent suggestions about affirming the<br/>\nchild&#39;s wishes - to the child as well.  I&#39;ve spoken to a child this<br/>\nway - and this seems to be a more delicate and gracious approach.<br/>\nThe mother in the story is very important, though.  My thoughts were <br/>\nto offer up the child&#39;s position in a positive light. Certainly, <br/>\nthis may not be easy - but my point is, we owe it to children to speak <br/>\nup.  Some mothers do not realize that it is ok for their children to <br/>\nhave and not focus constantly on giving so much up.  Certainly, too, <br/>\nno one wants to insult any mother.I offered up the conversation <br/>\nbetween two mothers to show that it is about the *issue* at hand - <br/>\nand not about offending anyone&#39;s mothering.  I just wanted to say,<br/>\ngo ahead and say a feeling for the child&#39;s sake if you feel there is <br/>\nan injustice going down.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane McBryan Alignan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Thad Martin","from":"Thad Martin &lt;tmartin@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"VIPeVgHlgKY-QYWgwaYDeofLKH-DRjBw138p65IhQnJMtvImp13M5rxPt4op8FKHSEY3qrexMfrgrG0NH01ycF1y756tlBawX3k","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 343","postDate":"945792857","msgId":5388,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNDcuNTM4OC45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5382,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":5387,"nextInTime":5389,"topicId":5347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"carolyn, i think we re on the same page.  i want to take sometime and respond to your email but don t really have it right now but soon. -susan austin,tx","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1899387168\">carolyn,<br/>\n<br/>\ni think we&#39;re on the same page.  i want to take sometime and respond to<br/>\nyour email but don&#39;t really have it right now but soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin,tx</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Carolyn Talarr","from":"&quot;Carolyn Talarr&quot; &lt;talarr@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"vh7Hc_QbqyG83HqrOE5XalqbK8j8KqNMAhajbkQZsvG5aY56-RkU9qFmtLrXVsTfifjwx5bV5yltjaFmzpisRbHzYHz8DelUBFIsRvFJeQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 343","postDate":"945761238","msgId":5377,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNDYuNTM3Ny45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5376,"nextInTopic":5382,"prevInTime":5376,"nextInTime":5378,"topicId":5347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Susan, Thanks for replying.

I&#39;ve seen this so often at Gymboree or other places where mothers try to force their children to do things because they think everyone else is doing it, etc.  I also think that in this case, since both parents were child psychologist/therapists that they really wanted to have their kid be &quot;perfect&quot;.  OY OY OY.<br/>\n<br/>\n    make comments as you had mentioned but also sit down with the kids and play with them.  often the toy is only interesting because another kid is having fun with it.  in my experience the fun is what the kids want not the object.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    I&#39;m guessing you mean play in general, not play to find a way to make them give up their toys!  :)  Yes, we did that too.  I&#39;m one of those mothers who&#39;s down playing with kids at playdates, who&#39;s with my kid at a playground--not stifling her (I hope), but there if she wants me, involved and playing too.  It&#39;s kind of sad sometimes, because other kids start talking to me and showing me what they can do, etc.  while their mothers are off chatting and it feels to me that they&#39;d really like *their* mothers to be there to see the same things.  (just a side note)<br/>\n<br/>\n    You then wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n    yes, they hit and get mad and lots of other &#39;frustrating&#39; kinds of things but we do have to be careful not to make them out to be so self-conscious, deliberate  and thought out. <br/>\n<br/>\n    A man at our Ethical culture meeting recently told a story about how he found a little boy throwing rocks at a squirrel in a tree.  He was internally appalled but then he asked the little boy *why* he was doing it. The boy replied &quot;so I can get the squirrel to come down and I can take care of him and have him as a pet.&quot;  Man.  That story has stayed with me.  I always try to ask Annie (even at her age--I hope that it will rub off) what she&#39;s trying to do when something happens that surprises me.<br/>\n<br/>\n    You continued:<br/>\n<br/>\n    what i find that helped me and saved me from feeling like the worst mom ever, was to have great compassion for myself and others (whether they &#39;deserved&#39; it or not:) because by doing this i kind of forced myself to accept the fact that i can&#39;t control really anything, not what others said, not they way others raised their kids, nor my own son.  once i understood that he had the right to develop and not be controlled, i realized his behavior was merely a reflection of his relationship to the world and that that relationship was facilitated not only by me but by his age and every other relationship he had.  what i needed to do was to interpret what he was communication.<br/>\n<br/>\n    This end-part sounds kind of like the ethical culture story...but I&#39;d really appreciate it if you would say more on &quot;his behavior was a reflection of his relationship to the world&quot;, either on- or off-list.<br/>\n<br/>\n    one day rene&#39; was stomping around (he was around 3) mad and said he wanted to be a &#39;daycare kid&#39;, that he didn&#39;t want to be with me, he wanted to be next door.   (snip)<br/>\n<br/>\n     this was the best he could do to communicate that he was not happy and something needed to change.  he was right, we changed and life&#39;s better for all of us. <br/>\n<br/>\n    That&#39;s a very instructive story, especially in the health-situation I&#39;m in right now. Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n    respect, faith and observation are key.  the best part of parenting is experiencing all the growth,  the worst part is that they have the uncanny knack for magnifying all your weaknesses :0   don&#39;t let your doubt override your natural good sense, but i think having the doubt now is a good thing because you&#39;ll be ready for what&#39;s to come:) <br/>\n<br/>\n    Your lips to God&#39;s ears!

With confrontational<br/>\napproach, although that gets a point &quot;out there&quot;, people&#39;s common response<br/>\nis to push away.  Maybe just maybe they&#39;ll resentfully reconsider what you<br/>\nsay later on, but maybe not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ni agree and i was thinking that if you are concerned about making someone<br/>\ndefensive a possible option would be to try and not form an opinion about<br/>\nwhat&#39;s happening, the mother may be less confident then it appears which could<br/>\npush her to &#39;control&#39; her child - a sort of knee jerk reaction to live up to<br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s expectation.  make comments as you had mentioned but also sit<br/>\ndown with the kids and play with them.  often the toy is only interesting<br/>\nbecause another kid is having fun with it.  in my experience the fun is what<br/>\nthe kids want not the object.   it&#39;s just that they can&#39;t separate the 2<br/>\nbecause at this young age that&#39;s the way life is, kind of an all or nothing<br/>\nstance.  we attribute qualities such as greed, selfishness, and meanness to<br/>\nlittle ones when in truth those are simply adult qualities, the kids are much<br/>\ntoo spontaneous to have these kinds of feelings.   yes, they hit and get mad<br/>\nand lots of other &#39;frustrating&#39; kinds of things but we do have to be careful<br/>\nnot to make them out to be so self-conscious, deliberate  and thought out.<br/>\n<br/>\nit&#39;s all so very organic and difficult because there are so many theories and<br/>\nopinions but what i find that helped me and saved me from feeling like the<br/>\nworst mom ever, was to have great compassion for myself and others (whether<br/>\nthey &#39;deserved&#39; it or not:) because by doing this i kind of forced myself to<br/>\naccept the fact that i can&#39;t control really anything, not what others said, not<br/>\nthey way others raised their kids, nor my own son.  once i understood that he<br/>\nhad the right to develop and not be controlled, i realized his behavior was<br/>\nmerely a reflection of his relationship to the world and that that relationship<br/>\nwas facilitated not only by me but by his age and every other relationship he<br/>\nhad.  what i needed to do was to interpret what he was communication.   for<br/>\nexample,  we live next to a daycare and across the street from an elementary<br/>\nschool.   one day rene&#39; was stomping around (he was around 3) mad and said he<br/>\nwanted to be a &#39;daycare kid&#39;, that he didn&#39;t want to be with me, he wanted to<br/>\nbe next door.   well this went on for sometime, i was really deeply hurt, so i<br/>\nleft him to &#39;play&#39; in the yard just to think, feel sorry for myself, beat<br/>\nmyself up, all that kind of thin, but then i realized that what he really want<br/>\nwas more one-on-one play, which he hadn&#39;t been getting because i had been very<br/>\nsick (some weird autoimmune thing that hit me about 18 months before), and we<br/>\nhad allowed ourselves to get lost in survival mode and weren&#39;t having fun.   so<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t that he wanted to be in daycare or that he hated me but this was the<br/>\nbest he could do to communicate that he was not happy and something needed to<br/>\nchange.  he was right, we changed and life&#39;s better for all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nmost popular views of children do not fully grasp or respect the native<br/>\nintelligence of children and really focus on the &#39;model&#39; them theory,  but<br/>\nrespect, faith and observation are key.  the best part of parenting is<br/>\nexperiencing all the growth,  the worst part is that they have the uncanny<br/>\nknack for magnifying all your weaknesses :0   don&#39;t let your doubt override<br/>\nyour natural good sense, but i think having the doubt now is a good thing<br/>\nbecause you&#39;ll be ready for what&#39;s to come:)<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin,tx</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"McBryan Alignan","from":"McBryan Alignan &lt;clairefree@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"sDwAxA3KJK1je9LPHRYiT5bA0F2zIzGKp8yoK86S1lmccjvHY36-Q0mnHrz1-JsPW5WzJITEt6d9fsihQh6aGEVQULL4USMQUEAl6j0D","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 343","postDate":"945615509","msgId":5355,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNDUuNTM1NS45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5354,"nextInTopic":5359,"prevInTime":5354,"nextInTime":5356,"topicId":5347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Stay with it for the child&#39;s sake.<br/>\nWhether or not the mother &quot;gets&quot; it - something has gone out there and <br/>\nhas her thinking now....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Mrs. or Dr. Better Share might then say:<br/>\n&quot;What about *sharing*? It&#39;s important to *share*! She knows how to <br/>\nshare (most likely translation: I have forced her to before and she <br/>\ndid it - I&#39;ll leave the being &quot;good&quot; at it alone).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps a good response might be:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think *respect* is extremely important - more important - *her* <br/>\nsense of well being, including feeling alright about having things <br/>\n(possessing things - another sticky subject for another post) and to <br/>\nbe able to continue on with using something if she chooses to - and <br/>\nnot to be forced to share with someone else because the <br/>\n&quot;Good Mommy Show&quot; is on...<br/>\n<br/>\n(Well, think of the last sentence - don&#39;t say it...)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so she responds:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;How will she ever *learn* to share if I don&#39;t teach her?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Patience. Observation. Believe it or not, I know of a little girl<br/>\nwho lives in France who was never told to say &quot;Please&quot; - never -<br/>\nand she says it often  - because others use the word often with her <br/>\n- and no one has ever set out to teach her something ***with the <br/>\nassumption that there would ever be a &quot;problem&quot;***.  Sometimes the<br/>\nlittle girl shares, too.  Sometimes, not, but her sense of what it<br/>\nmeans to share comes from herself and is not imposed on her by someone<br/>\nelse. Her wishes are respected and backed up by her Mom.  This <br/>\npreserves and nutures the girl&#39;s well being - her Self.  If she were <br/>\nforced to do these things, the root of the whole idea of sharing would <br/>\nbe lost anyway - making it quite distasteful, don&#39;t you think?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Gee, don&#39;t you think you are making a big deal out of this?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It is a big deal.  Those plastic veggies are a big deal to her and<br/>\nwhen you force her to give them away, you are giving away and wearing<br/>\naway the heart of her.&quot;  (This is a very interesting topic, I think:<br/>\nall this crap that children and people have - and hoard - - - makes <br/>\nperfect sense where all the trouble comes from.  I think it&#39;s a joke <br/>\nthe bags of plastic stuff that are lugged to the beach to play with.  <br/>\nIsn&#39;t there enough great stuff already there?! And so the fights begin!<br/>\nShare!)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could continue with something like:<br/>\n&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be a problem in the first place if people respected their <br/>\nchildren&#39;s wishes rather than putting more importance on *ideas* such <br/>\nas generosity and politeness - all those little social &quot;niceties&quot; that <br/>\ngrow too huge, stifling the life out of little people&#39;s play.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so it goes on like that - well, maybe not, if she is a therapist <br/>\nand you have &quot;challenged&quot; her &quot;expertise&quot;.  No matter though, the <br/>\nimportant thing is the child heard you - you spoke up for her - and the <br/>\nmother now has your very important point of view in her mind. Don&#39;t be <br/>\nquiet.

What though, exactly, is &quot;normal <br/>\nschool-ish hierarchy&quot;? <br/>\n<br/>\nI saw recently a great article in &#39;Growing Without Schooling&#39; entitled: <br/>\nGrowing Without Education, by Aaron Falbel from Massachusettes. It&#39;s <br/>\nabout letting go of *education* - the whole mentality of *educating* <br/>\nsomeone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly, someone &quot;hogging&quot; the trampoline for 25 minutes doesn&#39;t<br/>\nfly if others are waiting....but it seems that so much stress is<br/>\nput on educating the group for the goodness of the group - so much<br/>\nto do with social politesse, that what is important - the individual <br/>\nperson - is lost.  Children are &quot;social&quot; like anyone else.  Seems to me <br/>\nthat purposely teaching so much politesse - instead of just living it <br/>\n- puts children in an awkward position - particularly damaging to<br/>\nvery young children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think these group activities that go down so young interfere <br/>\nenormously with play and discovery. We avoid it.  As a child <br/>\ngrows and comes to understand better language and reasoning - <br/>\ncertain politeness and consideration for others begins to make <br/>\nsome sense - and is grasped because it begins to make sense - - - <br/>\nthen again, maybe not - but that&#39;s not the point.  <br/>\n<br/>\nForced sharing and such bugs me enormously.

The giving (taking and<br/>\naccepting) was more important than anything (anyone) else. It was <br/>\nforbidden to fluff the feathers of such &quot;nice&quot; social customs.<br/>\n<br/>\nComing back around to the importance of individuality and <br/>\nselfness (opposed to &quot;selfishness&quot;): Individuality seems squashed <br/>\nin these groups of children put together of the same age - put <br/>\ntogether to do pretty much the same thing and to learn the same thing.  <br/>\nI would find it a very special and rare program - one that respected <br/>\nthe *individual* child.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Educational&quot; or not, something usually still stinks.<br/>\nMy point is, don&#39;t be afraid to sniff a bit - and recognize a nasty <br/>\nsmell when you smell it - - -  and agree when a child makes a face <br/>\nwhen he smells the same thing.<br/>\n  <br/>\nI prefer to be outside.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDiane McBryan Alignan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;Tracy@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"YgOR00GZTe2L37Xqq9cAll373-KOtsRmpdnqee2huHzhttaErwdlltx2BSbxCjYHgvj4TZRrNaeWBE2G2rjSbBREwwSnCzSptF7ytxasxgIpk-_L0QygPQdQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 343","postDate":"945535770","msgId":5347,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNDQuNTM0Ny45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5349,"prevInTime":5346,"nextInTime":5348,"topicId":5347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
