I have also been worried about my 11yod lately.  She didn&#39;t seem to be <br/>\ninterested in anything that I saw as learning.  Then we decided to do a <br/>\nnature journal like Charlotte Mason recommends.  Well, she is a different <br/>\nkid!  The first day, she decided to write a beautiful poem for the front page <br/>\nof her journal. [ This from a kid who swears she hates to write]!  And even <br/>\nthough we always go for a daily walk - the dog insists-, now she&#39;s eager to <br/>\ngo to see what she will find to write about in her journal!  She also <br/>\ninformed me the other day that she really doesn&#39;t need to know all that math <br/>\n& history that I have been trying to teach her!  She&#39;s going to be a writer <br/>\nand an environmentalist!  I&#39;m just happy she found something she really wants <br/>\nto do.

I had been <br/>\nbothered by my 6 yr. old (7 next mth.)not reading. I read John Holt&#39;s book <br/>\n&quot;Learning All The Time&quot; and it enlightened me on the subject. I just totally <br/>\ndropped the subject of reading and last night as I was reading a book to him, <br/>\nhe said &quot;Hay, I can read this, it&#39;s an easy reader.&quot; And he proceeded to read <br/>\na few words!
