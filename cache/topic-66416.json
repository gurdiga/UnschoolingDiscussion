Me!  I know!  How about upwards of $1,000 for Sonlight?  Hack, hack.  <br/>\nThey *tell* you how wonderful they are in allowing you to purchase their <br/>\nbook recommendations at used bookstores or through the library.  What they <br/>\ndon&#39;t point out well enough is that many of their books are self-published.  <br/>\nEven books you may find elsewhere.  They use *specific* books, ie. copyright <br/>\ndates, etc., so what they don&#39;t make fully clear is that their manuals are <br/>\ngeared by page numbers.  [Lesson 1: read lines 17-35 on page 26 in so and <br/>\nso.]So if you bought the exact same book by the exact same author but if it <br/>\nis in big print, by a different publisher or a different copyright date, the <br/>\nmanuals will have your head spinning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole thing is set up so that you have to work 90 million times harder <br/>\nto save yourself some money.
