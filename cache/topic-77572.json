I was NOT the best <br/>\nstudent---not by a Lo-o-o-o-o-o-ong shot. My best friend&#39;s and my final exam <br/>\nscores couldn&#39;t be added together to get a passing grade in Chemistry 2!

(Extra credit!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when Mrs Magoffin got up to present the award, I was ribbing John about <br/>\nSURELY winning THIS one!
