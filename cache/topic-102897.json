Kathryn has taken a class at the museum and really liked it (but it<br/>\nwas done by other people.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it looks like is maybe they recorded the instruction part of the class<br/>\nand then the feedback comes from posting questions on a forum?<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn took a different video game course and used Multimedia Fusion. (It&#39;s<br/>\nonly for the PC, by the way.) She said she liked the graphics she could use<br/>\nbetter than Stagecast, and she could figure out how to do levels and design<br/>\na big boss to beat. (I know Stagecast will do levels and bosses but maybe<br/>\nthe tutorials weren&#39;t as helpful for something like that? She said she<br/>\nwasn&#39;t sure if she found Multimedia Fusion easier because it is easier or<br/>\nbecause she had live help during the course.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if Multimedia Fusion looks good, the course is only $20 and they give<br/>\nyou a $40 discount on the software so you could save money on the software<br/>\nby signing up for the course.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1123183,"authorName":"DACunefare@aol.com","from":"DACunefare@...","profile":"undermom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Video Game Design online class","postDate":"1107063975","msgId":102897,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZhLmJiNzYzNzUuMmYyZGNlYTdAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":102901,"prevInTime":102896,"nextInTime":102898,"topicId":102897,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Got this in my local email today - thought some of you might want to check it out. :) The Learning Community Group would like to announce the launch of our ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-414364980\">Got this in my local email today - thought some of you might want to check it <br/>\nout. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Learning Community Group would like to announce the launch of our<br/>\nCyberSchool and our first online class: Video Game Design!  This class<br/>\nteaches students from 4th grade on how to make their own video games using<br/>\nsimple drag and drop software. This nineteen chapter class covers the basics<br/>\nof creating an original video game from scratch, and introduces potential<br/>\nVideo Game Designers to one of the today’s biggest emerging industries!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe CyberSchool is a great way for students of all ages and backgrounds to<br/>\ncomplete an entire technology class from the comfort of their home, school,<br/>\nor community learning center. CyberSchool classes are both innovative and<br/>\ninexpensive and can be completed at a student’s own pace. For $20, students<br/>\nget one month to complete the same class that the LCG taught this past<br/>\nsummer at the Museum of Science in Boston for $235!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe CyberSchool interface provides video chapters of a master instructor’s<br/>\ncomputer screen as he/she walks students through the Video Game Design<br/>\nprocess step-by-step. The CyberSchool also provides students with access to<br/>\nan online Forum System for discussion with other students and LCG staff. <br/>\nSoon students will be able to view their work in an upcoming CyberSchool<br/>\nGallery. All that is required to take classes through the CyberSchool is a<br/>\ncomputer with an Internet connection, Flash Player 7 (free) and speakers (or<br/>\nheadphones).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe software required for this class is Multimedia Fusion (currently PC<br/>\nonly). This software is available exclusively to LCG students who have<br/>\nenrolled in our Video Game Design class for $60! (40% off the retail price<br/>\nof $100).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo enroll:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)      Go to www.thelcg.com/cyberschool and sign up for a free CyberSchool<br/>\naccount.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)      Log into the CyberSchool and purchase the class.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)      Purchase Multimedia Fusion at www.thelcg.com/store.<br/>\n<br/>\n4)      You can start the class once you have received your software kit in<br/>\nthe mail!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe look forward to seeing you at the CyberSchool!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe CyberSchool Team<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cyberschoolinfo@...\">cyberschoolinfo@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102853,"nextTopicId":102843}}
