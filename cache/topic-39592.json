Oh well.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonya<br/>\nBrittany & Melody&#39;s Mommy<br/>\n4/22/99    12/01/01<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAmerican moms go after world breastfeeding record<br/>\n<br/>\nOn August 3, 2002, hundreds of mothers will gather at a park in Berkeley, <br/>\nCalifornia, for what they hope will be a record-breaking display of <br/>\nsynchronized suckling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe women are hoping to break the Guinness World Record for simultaneous <br/>\nbreastfeeding. Australia captured the title last year by coordinating the <br/>\nefforts of 536 lactating mothers and their babies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was on a recent holiday to the Land Down Under that organizer Ellen Sirbu <br/>\nlearned of the Aussie breastfeeding challenge and decided to host an <br/>\nAmerican version of the event.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I was so impressed by how matter-of-factly everyone in Australia <br/>\nbreastfeeds,&quot; says Sirbu, event coordinator and director of the Berkeley <br/>\nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children <br/>\n(WIC). &quot;I thought, this is so nice, why don&#39;t we do this here?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe world record attempt, which will take place during World Breastfeeding <br/>\nWeek, is expected to draw more than a thousand nursing moms from as far away <br/>\nas Pennsylvania. Sirbu hopes the event will increase awareness of <br/>\nbreastfeeding in the United States, and will encourage mothers, <br/>\npolicymakers, and medical professionals to promote and support the practice.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My goal is to make breastfeeding a more public thing � to get the whole <br/>\ncommunity involved,&quot; she says. In fact, she encourages everyone, not just <br/>\nmoms, to come out to the event and show their support.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you can do<br/>\nThe world record attempt will be held Saturday, August 3, 2002, from 12:00 <br/>\np.m. to 4:00 p.m. at Martin Luther King Jr. Park in Berkeley, California.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re a breastfeeding mom who would like to participate, send an e-mail <br/>\nwith your name, address, and phone number to: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:esirbu@...\">esirbu@...</a>.
