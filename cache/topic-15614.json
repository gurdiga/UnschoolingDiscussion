I just can&#39;t seem to help it!  Hope I don&#39;t make my kids<br/>\nneurotic...   But at least we have all of our game pieces!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also tried giving a reminder and telling them that if such and<br/>\nsuch isn&#39;t picked up in (blank) amount of time, that it will go in the<br/>\ngarage.  Unfortunately, they have so much stuff they don&#39;t care.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nalso done the rotation thing - box up a bunch of stuff, then after a few<br/>\nmonths get it out and box up some other stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read so many organizing books, web sites, etc, and get motivated for<br/>\na short time.  My bottom line is still too much stuff.  I am slowly<br/>\nworking on getting rid of extraneous stuff and better arrangement of what<br/>\nwe do keep.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nMom to two girls, ages 8 & 5</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15611,"nextTopicId":15620}}
