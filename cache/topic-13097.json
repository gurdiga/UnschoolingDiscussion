No doubt some do. But my son&#39;s good <br/>\nfriend, who is 7 like my son (and also unschooled), is an only child and  <br/>\nhas no tolerance for my younger son, who is 3. He thinks the toddler is <br/>\ndisgusting because he is messy and wears diapers. He has no patience for the <br/>\n3yo&#39;s slower and more clumsy play. He won&#39;t play with him and sort of leads <br/>\nmy older son to shun the younger or play away from him. He suggests board <br/>\ngames and other activities that a 3yo can&#39;t do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis friend plays well with my older one and is generally well-behaved. He <br/>\nis precocious and sort of like a &quot;little adult,&quot; so he likes being around <br/>\ngrownups and can have an amazingly reasoned chat with adults. And he does <br/>\nlike kids who are not his age. But only if they are _older_.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70099,"nextTopicId":70072}}
