I was <br/>\n  carrying her around, and walked past the big mirror in the hallway. <br/>\n  On a whim,I stopped and showed Sarah her reflection.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You should have SEEN the amazement on her face, as she shifted eye <br/>\n  contact from her own mirror image, to my mirror image. I could SEE <br/>\n  the gears turning as she figured it all out. My mom walked past and <br/>\n  said hello in the mirror, and Sarah&#39;s eyes absolutely bugged out! It <br/>\n  wsa comical. She looks amazed a lot of the time, anyway, but this was <br/>\n  just too funny.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, she sees gramma in the mirror, and then turns her head to see <br/>\n  Gramma not in the mirror...and gets this frown on her forehead, and <br/>\n  even looks like going to start whimpering. Confusion, amazement, even <br/>\n  a little worry...and just plain old &quot;getting it.&quot; Before we were <br/>\n  done, she was pushing against her mirror foot with her real foot, and <br/>\n  touching the mirror with her hand. And very happy about the whole <br/>\n  thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Very cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n  HeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
