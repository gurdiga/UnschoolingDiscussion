First, it is not SHARING information, it is cramming<br/>\ndown a little kids throat.  When that child approaches a home on Halloween<br/>\nwhich has its porch light on (the secret code of i&#39;ll play trick or treat),<br/>\nthe child is expecting a certain scenario.  By turning on the light or<br/>\ngiving whatever indication that you will engage in trick or treating, the<br/>\nadult is indicating to that child that they will engage in said scenario.<br/>\nWhat the kid gets is somebody&#39;s version of God, not candy.  It&#39;s like a<br/>\nfraud.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I used to belong to one of those churches that used tracts.  They<br/>\nwere scary even to me and I was used to being around people who could fit<br/>\nthe phrase &quot;washed in the blood&quot; in every day conversation.  The pictures<br/>\nand prose are purposely set up to incite fear and guilt.  To me, it is no<br/>\ndifferent than if somebody showed my small child the movie &quot;Halloween&quot; for<br/>\nthe express purpose of scarying them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83798,"nextTopicId":83732}}
