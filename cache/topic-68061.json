At the beginning of the next <br/>\nyear when we didn&#39;t show up, the school called and I just told them the kids <br/>\nwould be homeschooling again..no problem, no hassles.  The classrooms there <br/>\nwere packed like sardines, they had so many problems with bad test scores, <br/>\nnon-English speaking children, they almost seemed glad to be rid of a few <br/>\nkids.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here, in WV, a tiny community with very few good jobs, they get angry at <br/>\nhomeschoolers with a vengeance!  There was an article in our paper saying <br/>\nthat homeschoolers are taking money from the schools, taking away jobs <br/>\nbecause there are less children...unbelievable.  Nothing about how the school <br/>\ncould attract more students, try to accommodate homeschoolers, or pointing <br/>\nout the school&#39;s good points...it was all about money.  Life in our tiny town <br/>\nEVOLVES AROUND the public school (and especially public school sports.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, our Michael told one of his teachers he would be homeschooling next <br/>\nyear, and she called asking what the problem is, etc...we talked for a long <br/>\ntime.  2 weeks later, Michael came home with the &quot;student of the Month&quot; <br/>\naward...hmmm...funny, about 3 or 4 weeks ago he was spending time in the <br/>\nprincipal&#39;s office for bad behavior  a couple times per week....<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67775,"nextTopicId":68057}}
