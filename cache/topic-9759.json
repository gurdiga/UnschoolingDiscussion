Why they felt the need to be equal [except along the <br/>\nlines of equal pay for equal work] is beyond me, why strive to be <br/>\nwhat you are not, men and women are not equal, they are different. <br/>\n  Personally I like it when a man opens a door for me or raises his <br/>\nhat as a greeting, however many men are afraid to open doors <br/>\nbecause of responses they sometimes encounter &quot;I CAN OPEN <br/>\nDOORS FOR MYSELF&quot; etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI personally can&#39;t think of any real good that has come from the <br/>\nfeminism movement.  I&#39;m talking 60s here, as it was earlier <br/>\nfeminists that gained the vote for women and the acceptance of <br/>\nwomen wearing trousers they were good things.    But on the down <br/>\nside the feminist movement has made women say such things as <br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m ONLY a housewife&quot; with shame instead of the pride women <br/>\nonce felt in their role as wife and Mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nMen and women are different and thank Mother Nature for that <br/>\ndifference!   I can work as hard and as long as many men, <br/>\nespecially since I can wear jeans and not be restricted by the type <br/>\nof garment I am wearing, but it sure feels good when working hard <br/>\nto have a pair of strong male arms there to help out with the real <br/>\nheavy stuff.   Most men are physically stronger and larger than <br/>\nmost women, this is an inescapable fact, a fact which is driven <br/>\nhome to me each time I work alongside my 15 year old son who <br/>\njust two years ago had the body and strength of a child.   To see <br/>\nthe way he can lift things with one arm that I have to fight to move <br/>\nwith both of mine reinforces that difference.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn most cases the differences between male and female are <br/>\ncomplimentary, our strengths and weaknesses are often at <br/>\nopposite ends of the poles, so together can make a good team. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been a SAHM Mom for many years, I have worked a few part <br/>\ntime jobs [tupperware etc] especially in the earlier years.  The <br/>\nmost important thing to me when deciding on what work I could do <br/>\nwas to ensure that either my Mother or husband would be available <br/>\nto look after the children while I was working.  This was for little <br/>\nextras, my oldest son was really into computers and devoured <br/>\nbooks on the subject long before we had one, so I sold tupperware <br/>\nto buy a Commodore 64 for his use.  Now I guess I am sort of a <br/>\nworking Mom, but the big difference is that I work at home so I am <br/>\nhere if the kids need me, and another big bonus is that they can be <br/>\ninvolved and understand what I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSumming up; for me feminism has given me the right to vote and <br/>\nwear jeans, however it has taken from me the chance to feel as <br/>\nthough society values my role, if there is no $ value on it then it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to have a value.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sue   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Winona Farm in Minnesota Welcomes Unschoolers All Year Round<br/>\nMy website:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e\">http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e</a><br/>\nFarm website:    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/\">http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/</a><br/>\nFarm newsletter: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To believe in something, and not to live it, <br/>\n is to be dishonest.&quot;   -Mahatma Gandhi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"2WWJ-M7LUKJjaPe5sEji6poijgsiCx7WHtfktwlRXzMIrP1r3FqHOf-g68VNOQ-Xm31lgEwhB6U8iNzvQZR9wArUmA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] a bit of a screed","postDate":"961911395","msgId":9829,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNjI1MDU1NC5lNVA1czBiMjY2NzhAc20wMTAxLnByb21lZGlhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":9828,"nextInTopic":9846,"prevInTime":9828,"nextInTime":9830,"topicId":9759,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"O.K., this is an serious, honest question and not an attempt to start any war.

And then they&#39;ll be on lists somewhere saying the sorts of things<br/>\nwe&#39;ve heard about mothers on this list from time to time - so<br/>\njudgemental, so intoleran&#39;t, wont even listen to my point of view etc<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor what its worth, I am a committed SAHM, have been homeschooling for<br/>\n14 years and love being at home. I also know people who thought they<br/>\nwanted to be SAHMs but who found that they just didn&#39;t like the &#39;job&#39;<br/>\n(let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s something you can&#39;t possibly know you&#39;ll like until<br/>\nyou&#39;ve tried it)  and who felt that their kids were better off going to<br/>\nschool with teachers who liked kids, and coming home to a loving mother,<br/>\nrather than staying at home with a discontented, resentful mother. Okay,<br/>\nso we think they have work to do in their heads, but I&#39;m not going to<br/>\njudge them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people do not have the same goals for their kids / family as I do<br/>\nas a SAHM and homeschooling mother, that invole a higher income than can<br/>\nbe provided by one income. That doesn&#39;t mean they care less, or are<br/>\nworse people - it just means they look at life differently to me. Just<br/>\nas some people are christians, muslims, budhists, jews, whatever, rather<br/>\nthan atheist humanists like me, but that doesn&#39;t mean I condemn them as<br/>\nbad, or stupid or such like - they are entitled to their own beliefs,<br/>\nIMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I&#39;d like to say that my husband is, IMO, a very fine parent, in<br/>\nspite of the fact that he is away from home 48 hours a week working to<br/>\npay for us to stay home. Or does the<br/>\n&lt;In order to be good at something you actually have to do it and if you<br/>\nare in one place (your bosses office) and your children and in another<br/>\n(a daycare institution) then you are not doing<br/>\nthe job of parenting.  &gt;<br/>\nbit only apply to women? For in fact, I am providing the daycare that<br/>\nallows my husband to go to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sooo disappointed the level of intolerance in this conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lainie Duro","from":"Lainie Duro &lt;lainie@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"eGt7X8DpIglMQsSi66FQAtIeCROEol76YCvBRhaYQ7FthjKRoRmOV1G5wt3MK6cqysPg1_1ykQ4SsBOuDs0OZ3ZBcrYqC7oY3Dk","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] a bit of a screed","postDate":"961864249","msgId":9770,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5NTRFMjM5LjREMTQ4RjVEQG1pbmRzcHJpbmcuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDI5LjZlM2Q5NWEuMjY4NWZmNWJAYW9sLmNvbT4gPDM5NTRCMUJFLjRERTFEMjZAaG92YWMuY29tPiA8Mzk1NERDMEMuNjBCRUNCMkRAbWluZHNwcmluZy5jb20+IDwzOTU0QzUwMi43QUM2MEM4RkBob3ZhYy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":9769,"nextInTopic":9771,"prevInTime":9769,"nextInTime":9771,"topicId":9759,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey Debra...

Money isn&#39;t the<br/>\ngoal<br/>\n&gt; freedom is... Money just pays the bills we choose to run up.  The majority<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; my clients want to do something different with their lives as right now<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; are just in &quot;jobs&quot; rather than living a lifestyle that gives them the<br/>\nfreedom<br/>\n&gt; to all the things they love, including staying at home with their kids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Grown ups who choose to send their babies and toddlers to daycare and not<br/>\n&gt; good parents by definition... In order to be good at something you<br/>\nactually<br/>\n&gt; have to do it and if you are in one place (your bosses office) and your<br/>\n&gt; children and in another (a daycare institution) then you are not doing the<br/>\n&gt; job of parenting.  If you told your employee that you were a good employee<br/>\n&gt; and then proceeded to tell her when you wouldn&#39;t be available because of<br/>\n&gt; other comittments the employer would look at your like you were crazy and<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be hired.  The damage that has been and is being done by daycare<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; being well documented in this country.  I can&#39;t speak for other countries.<br/>\n&gt; Daycare is for parents not for babies and toddlers.  I can see using<br/>\ndaycare<br/>\n&gt; if you&#39;ve husband or wife died or some tragedy happened whereby you are<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; only one to take care of your kids needs, but women go around getting<br/>\nknocked<br/>\n&gt; up because they  miss the love and affection they didn&#39;t get from their<br/>\n&gt; parents and they believe they have a right to get it from someone else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sure I&#39;m judgmental about daycare... It&#39;s a lie to pretend that everyone<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; open to absoutely everything.  We judge people&#39;s lifestyles and choices<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; then decide if we want to be in relationships with them.  It&#39;s how the<br/>\nworld<br/>\n&gt; works.  If I see a homeless person I&#39;m not going to bring him into my<br/>\nhouse<br/>\n&gt; and befriend him, because I see that lifestyle as a choice that I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant<br/>\n&gt; to be involved in.  The same goes for parents who put their kids in<br/>\ndaycare.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to be involved with people who don&#39;t value their children<br/>\nover<br/>\n&gt; money....

We were not prepared financially to have a child<br/>\n&gt; and have one parent at home, but we were not so unprepared that I felt I needed to<br/>\n&gt; abort or put the baby up for adoption.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A lot of what has been posted on this thread is posted under the assumption that<br/>\n&gt; the MOTHER must stay at home with the baby. While I believe that is the ideal,<br/>\n&gt; particularly during the first year of a baby&#39;s life, it&#39;s just not possible for<br/>\n&gt; everyone, and I don&#39;t believe it helps ANYONE to be judgmental towards their<br/>\n&gt; lifestyle (I struggle with this, too, when I encounter women who spend thousands of<br/>\n&gt; dollars on fertility treatment and end up sending their child to daycare within the<br/>\n&gt; first 2 months of life). Since both DH and I had to work, and I was the one with<br/>\n&gt; the best earning potential, my husband opted to work graveyards on the weekends so<br/>\n&gt; we didn&#39;t have to use daycare. It wasn&#39;t easy. It ISN&#39;T easy. But it&#39;s what we HAD<br/>\n&gt; to do to get by. Thus far, Monk has shown no ill effect, is completely bonded to<br/>\n&gt; his father AND to me. I was able to nurse until Monk weaned himself, and Monk has<br/>\n&gt; the benefit of a close, trusting relationship with his father.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, there are plenty of people in this world who have loving relationships<br/>\n&gt; with their children in spite of their use of childcare. I think it&#39;s wrong to<br/>\n&gt; condemn every woman, as well as the feminist movement in general (if you want to<br/>\n&gt; see true feminism in action, check out the community at hipmama.com - a very<br/>\n&gt; SUPPORTIVE environment for SAHMs and Mamas who work outside the home as well).<br/>\n&gt; Believe it or not, the feminist movement provided women with CHOICES. I think the<br/>\n&gt; thing that makes being a stay at home mom so amazing is that it&#39;s a choice you have<br/>\n&gt; made, rather than a societal directive & I&#39;m wondering if there wouldn&#39;t be more<br/>\n&gt; resentful parents and more messed up kids if mamas were FORCED to stay at home.<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s no gender associated with desiring to give your child the love and<br/>\n&gt; nurturing he/she needs. My husband does it every day of the week, and he&#39;s about as<br/>\n&gt; &quot;masculine&quot; as they come...as well, I don&#39;t feel I will be any more &quot;femme&quot; when I<br/>\n&gt; am at home with the children (and I&#39;m *still* not going to shave!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m honestly shocked that this thread has arisen amidst all of the cool,<br/>\n&gt; non-mainstream, supportive ideas I&#39;ve seen here. Right now I&#39;m wondering if I truly<br/>\n&gt; belong on this list at all. Discussion of a topic is one thing, but complete<br/>\n&gt; dismissal of the opposing view as wrong or immoral is the hallmark of intolerance<br/>\n&gt; and hatred.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; livelifelove<br/>\n&gt; Lainie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Accurate impartial advice on everything from laptops to table saws.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4634/14/_/448294/_/961855501/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4634/14/_/448294/_/961855501/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To Unsubscribe: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"marbleface@aol.com","from":"marbleface@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"7YNpyUF58kztYefNiByDb06mQbxX8KIE_u1f3-Yu_u54DKEwFPLYfqvc7FLjbFFvL6ZLk2tVbGP0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] a bit of a screed","postDate":"961854141","msgId":9765,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM2LjdiMzIyMTAuMjY4NjE0YmRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":9764,"nextInTopic":9767,"prevInTime":9764,"nextInTime":9766,"topicId":9759,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Re:  feminism etc. Most, if not all, of the posts I have read on this thread reference the poster s personal experience -- i.e., my sis did this, my neighbor","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1344991916\">Re:  feminism etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost, if not all, of the posts I have read on this thread reference the <br/>\nposter&#39;s personal experience -- i.e., my sis did this, my neighbor did this, <br/>\nmy mom did this, I did this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel it is important to remember that there is wide, wide world out there <br/>\nthat has absolutely nothing to do with our own personal experiences.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo base judgements about feminism (or any other ism) on our own narrow <br/>\nexperiences seems mistaken to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I feel it is important to remember that there may be points during one&#39;s <br/>\nlife when one set of circumstances fits and then another period where another <br/>\nset fits.

Children may or may not be a factor in any of this at <br/>\nvarious stages.  One may or may not have children at various ages -- younger <br/>\nor older.  One may have a career.  A calling. Or a job.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe nuances of each individual woman&#39;s history are not easily caught in broad <br/>\nsweeping statements about whether one &quot;should&quot; be a working mom or an at-home <br/>\nmom.

It <br/>\n is unfair to suggest that people who use day care per se don&#39;t love their <br/>\n children as much or aren&#39;t as fit parents as people who stay home with them. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The reason to ask the question is so that people take a look at the way they <br/>\nare currently making money and realize they can make money doing something <br/>\nthey love rather than something to just make money.... Money isn&#39;t the goal <br/>\nfreedom is... Money just pays the bills we choose to run up.  The majority of <br/>\nmy clients want to do something different with their lives as right now they <br/>\nare just in &quot;jobs&quot; rather than living a lifestyle that gives them the freedom <br/>\nto all the things they love, including staying at home with their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrown ups who choose to send their babies and toddlers to daycare and not <br/>\ngood parents by definition... In order to be good at something you actually <br/>\nhave to do it and if you are in one place (your bosses office) and your <br/>\nchildren and in another (a daycare institution) then you are not doing the <br/>\njob of parenting.  If you told your employee that you were a good employee <br/>\nand then proceeded to tell her when you wouldn&#39;t be available because of <br/>\nother comittments the employer would look at your like you were crazy and you <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be hired.  The damage that has been and is being done by daycare is <br/>\nbeing well documented in this country.  I can&#39;t speak for other countries.  <br/>\nDaycare is for parents not for babies and toddlers.  I can see using daycare <br/>\nif you&#39;ve husband or wife died or some tragedy happened whereby you are the <br/>\nonly one to take care of your kids needs, but women go around getting knocked <br/>\nup because they  miss the love and affection they didn&#39;t get from their <br/>\nparents and they believe they have a right to get it from someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure I&#39;m judgmental about daycare... It&#39;s a lie to pretend that everyone is <br/>\nopen to absoutely everything.  We judge people&#39;s lifestyles and choices and <br/>\nthen decide if we want to be in relationships with them.  It&#39;s how the world <br/>\nworks.  If I see a homeless person I&#39;m not going to bring him into my house <br/>\nand befriend him, because I see that lifestyle as a choice that I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto be involved in.  The same goes for parents who put their kids in daycare.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t want to be involved with people who don&#39;t value their children over <br/>\nmoney.... Because that&#39;s what it comes down to.  Why else, but the almighty <br/>\nbuck, would anyone put their children in daycare....<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way the daycare issue is part of my thesis and thoroughly researched.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9787,"nextTopicId":9851}}
