The hub&#39;s work fine for dial-up in<br/>\nour experience, but you can&#39;t use them for cable.<br/>\nThe hubs seem to be going by the wayside.<br/>\nWe just got a router that can be wireless or use the network cable<br/>\n(not cheap, so try to position the computers as close as possible) but<br/>\nwith our new computer it was a nightmare to set up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt ended up taking three days, a return and about 4 tech calls, even<br/>\nwith a computer geek in the house that had tried virtually everything<br/>\nincluding messing with the ip addresses.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, most routers automatically walk you through the set up.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111912,"nextTopicId":112065}}
