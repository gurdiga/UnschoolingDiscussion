I think Kirby had sex a time or two (at the same <br/>\ncamping event) but I know he had condoms because I have them to him when he <br/>\nseemed in a possible range.  It didn&#39;t cause him to go sex crazy.  It&#39;s been <br/>\nnearly a year, and he was the girls boyfriend (in a way, they went to one movie, <br/>\nhe visited her once and she came over here once) for several weeks and decided <br/>\nshe wasn&#39;t really all that nice.  No drama, no trauma.   If it happened (as I <br/>\nsuspect), she was his first but he wasn&#39;t her first.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy choice wasn&#39;t &quot;to tolerate&quot; it or not.  It seems to have been a done deal. <br/>\n He talked to me an somewhat vague terms about the situation being serious, <br/>\nand I talked to him in somewhat less vague terms about birth control, and <br/>\ncondoms not being 100%, and serious relationships needing back-up birth control. He <br/>\nsaid &quot;I&#39;ll mention that.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was his age I was having sex.  He&#39;s that age and is not (in general <br/>\nterms).<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Those are some places that the &quot;it&#39;s their body so <br/>\nwhat&#39;s the harm?&quot; philosophy seems extreme to me. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t heard people say &quot;it&#39;s their body so what&#39;s the harm?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt IS their body.

The DAY my older brother turned 18 he went out and got himself a tatoo...had been told no for years.... and I&#39;m not saying never, I&#39;m just saying that I doubt that at 11 I&#39;d be willing. I could be wrong though, that&#39;s a few years off. I used to think that a mother I knew was nuts for letting her 4 year old son get his ear pierced, but he&#39;d wanted it and actually took good care of it. A big problem is that my oldest, at least right now, I&#39;m not sure she&#39;d take good care of a piercing. We&#39;re planning to get her ears done for Christmas though and if things go well, then...well...who knows...<br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\nStepheny Cappel &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stephc62@...\">stephc62@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t say never in this situation.

It came out horrible, was uncentered etc.  When he was 16 I signed for him to get a tattoo to cover up.  He paid for it himself, everything is fixed and we all lived.  I allowed all brother and sisters to watch him get it, they saw and I&#39;m not sure if any of them think they want one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also kind of used it as an id, which I could have kicked myself for afterwards.  So people thought he was old enough to buy cigarettes and alcohol just because he had a tattoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh won&#39;t &quot;allow&quot; dd14 to get a second piercing in her ear yet.  I don&#39;t see the problem with it.  I have two, I like it. Thing is pretty soon she will likely end up with the other earrings in her ears.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk about piercings all the time.  We know people that have had their tongue pierced, that looks like a hurt, and they can&#39;t talk right afterwards.  Big readjustment.  My son was talking about pulling hair out of the nose in reference to piercing the nose LOL... he doesn&#39;t want that.  I would prefer that they keep the piercing to their ears, but they will eventually do it if they want to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDd 23 has a belly button piercing although she doesn&#39;t wear the ring anymore and it constantly bothers her.  I thought if she put the ring back in maybe it wouldn&#39;t bother her so much.  She also got a tattoo that had to be fixed on her leg.  Better to allow it, within a reasonable time frame.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a little girl who is 9 to be wanting it for two years is proof enough to me she probably would have ended up doing it herself or trying to let a friend do it.  Glad she had it done and I hope she enjoys it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStepheny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Wow...I don&#39;t think that I could allow any of the kids to pierce their nose at jsut 11 years old....<br/>\n<br/>\n  MamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My, my, I&#39;ve come a long way in the past year!

Sounded <br/>\n&gt; reasonable to me and her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last week she told me she wanted her nose pierced.  She walked around <br/>\n&gt; for a couple of days with various beads blue tacked or uhued to her <br/>\n&gt; nose to see if she liked the look.  Yesterday she had her nose <br/>\n&gt; pierced.  She had it done with a needle in a reputable &#39;beauty <br/>\n&gt; salon&#39;.  I could tell that it hurt - a lot. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She was amazingly calm and even though she&#39;d practiced several swear <br/>\n&gt; words in the car on the way into the city (for use at the appropriate <br/>\n&gt; time LOL), she didn&#39;t swear at all.  So now she is sporting a <br/>\n&gt; &#39;sleeper&#39; until her nose heals enough to exchange it for a tiny pin.  <br/>\n&gt; The sleeper looked hoooooge yesterday but today it looks rather normal <br/>\n&gt; to us and she&#39;s very pleased with her new look.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the way home in the car we talked about what dh and ds 14 would <br/>\n&gt; say.

Now he wants to have his <br/>\n&gt; ear pierced.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Megan 8, was the most distressed by the whole procedure.  She wanted <br/>\n&gt; to come in and watch it being done.

So now she is sporting a &#39;sleeper&#39; until her nose heals enough to exchange it for a tiny pin.  The sleeper looked hoooooge yesterday but today it looks rather normal to us and she&#39;s very pleased with her new look.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the way home in the car we talked about what dh and ds 14 would say.  Predictions ranged from hysterical laughter from ds to a very dry &quot;Oh Emma&quot; from dh.  We were far from correct &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh smiled and waved from inside the bank when we arrived to pick him up from work, turned away to go to the door, did a double take, covered his mouth with both hands and yelled &quot;Whyyyyyyyyy???&quot;  roflmao.  He was thinking of the pain, not the way it looked.  Emma thought his reaction was hilarious.<br/>\n<br/>\nDs (who had stayed home), according to Emma,  looked at her, nodded and said &quot;so you had it done then&quot; his mouth twitched a little and Emma grinned at him, and he grinned back.  Now he wants to have his ear pierced.<br/>\n<br/>\nMegan 8, was the most distressed by the whole procedure.  She wanted to come in and watch it being done.  Her eyes filled with tears and she needed hugs.  She said she wants her ears pierced but thinks she should wait til she&#39;s thirteen because she&#39;s worried about the pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve read this far, thankyou.  I needed to tell someone who can understand and appreciate the hooooge shift in attitude that I&#39;m undergoing.  My kids are so much happier than they&#39;ve ever been and so am I.  Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m only just managing to muddle through our days, but behind that feeling is the knowledge that my kids are growing in freedom, love and the firm belief that they can &quot;do what they wanna do, be what they wanna be, yeah&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nRamble over &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nhugs, Lee-Ann in Australia<br/>\naka Dances With Goats<br/>\naka Stands With a Mop<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

It came out horrible, was uncentered etc.  When he was 16 I signed for him to get a tattoo to cover up.  He paid for it himself, everything is fixed and we all lived.  I allowed all brother and sisters to watch him get it, they saw and I&#39;m not sure if any of them think they want one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also kind of used it as an id, which I could have kicked myself for afterwards.  So people thought he was old enough to buy cigarettes and alcohol just because he had a tattoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh won&#39;t &quot;allow&quot; dd14 to get a second piercing in her ear yet.  I don&#39;t see the problem with it.  I have two, I like it. Thing is pretty soon she will likely end up with the other earrings in her ears.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk about piercings all the time.  We know people that have had their tongue pierced, that looks like a hurt, and they can&#39;t talk right afterwards.  Big readjustment.  My son was talking about pulling hair out of the nose in reference to piercing the nose LOL... he doesn&#39;t want that.  I would prefer that they keep the piercing to their ears, but they will eventually do it if they want to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDd 23 has a belly button piercing although she doesn&#39;t wear the ring anymore and it constantly bothers her.  I thought if she put the ring back in maybe it wouldn&#39;t bother her so much.  She also got a tattoo that had to be fixed on her leg.  Better to allow it, within a reasonable time frame.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a little girl who is 9 to be wanting it for two years is proof enough to me she probably would have ended up doing it herself or trying to let a friend do it.

Luckily, we still had lots of dye left as his hair was very short, so<br/>\nwe added more.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe  now wants to let it grow out, get a spikey hairdo and change the color<br/>\non the tips daily.  His hair does grow fast so we shall see if he still<br/>\nwants that in a few months. Right now, it is naturally colored ... as it was<br/>\ngrowing out, I would ask him every few days if he was ready to have it<br/>\nbuzzed again.  We almost had to shave it to get it all out when he was<br/>\nready.  I didn&#39;t pressure him ... he knew he could say no (he did for<br/>\nweeks!).  Last year, when he had the mohawk and earring, we went to my dad&#39;s<br/>\nfor the holidays ... boy, did he ever get ribbing from both sides of my<br/>\nfamily ... but he was able to take it good naturedly (fortunately, they were<br/>\nnot too brutal with him!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbara<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbara Moreda<br/>\nA community for Women: Our Place  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pub83.ezboard.com/bmiamivalleymoms\">http://pub83.ezboard.com/bmiamivalleymoms</a><br/>\nIf you plan for one year, plant rice.

When my dd, Emma, was 9<br/>\nshe wanted her ears pierced.  She was desperate to have them pierced.  She<br/>\n*needed* them pierced - puhleeze mum, I&#39;m begging you.  &quot;No, sweetie, I want<br/>\nyou to wait til you&#39;re thirteen, it&#39;s a &#39;milestone&#39; and the piercing will<br/>\n*mean* something&quot; (to me, not to her!!)  She made me see sense on that one<br/>\nand said she was prepared to wait until she was 10 as a compromise because<br/>\n10 sounds like a &#39;milestone&#39; age &lt;g&gt;  The big &#39;one-oh&#39; rolled around and her<br/>\nears were pierced.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No she&#39;s 11 1/2.  In the past year we&#39;ve talked about her getting a tattoo<br/>\nbut were told that she has to wait til she&#39;s around 16 because the skin is<br/>\ngoing through too many changes during puberty.  Sounded reasonable to me and<br/>\nher.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last week she told me she wanted her nose pierced.  She walked around for<br/>\na couple of days with various beads blue tacked or uhued to her nose to see<br/>\nif she liked the look.  Yesterday she had her nose pierced.  She had it done<br/>\nwith a needle in a reputable &#39;beauty salon&#39;.  I could tell that it hurt - a<br/>\nlot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She was amazingly calm and even though she&#39;d practiced several swear words<br/>\nin the car on the way into the city (for use at the appropriate time LOL),<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t swear at all.  So now she is sporting a &#39;sleeper&#39; until her nose<br/>\nheals enough to exchange it for a tiny pin.  The sleeper looked hoooooge<br/>\nyesterday but today it looks rather normal to us and she&#39;s very pleased with<br/>\nher new look.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the way home in the car we talked about what dh and ds 14 would say.<br/>\nPredictions ranged from hysterical laughter from ds to a very dry &quot;Oh Emma&quot;<br/>\nfrom dh.

He was thinking<br/>\nof the pain, not the way it looked.  Emma thought his reaction was<br/>\nhilarious.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ds (who had stayed home), according to Emma,  looked at her, nodded and<br/>\nsaid &quot;so you had it done then&quot; his mouth twitched a little and Emma grinned<br/>\nat him, and he grinned back.
