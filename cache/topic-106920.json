Sometimes the baby  <br/>\nwould pick up a particular toy they had just been using, say, a matchbox car,  <br/>\nwhich they wanted back.  I showed them they could trade with him, not just  <br/>\ngrab it out of his hand or complain that Will had the toy.   They  learned to <br/>\ngive him something else, and not just some baby toy, to get the car  back.  They <br/>\nalso learned that the baby would interrupt them a lot, but if  they gave him <br/>\ntheir full attention at that moment, he would soon lose interest  and they <br/>\ncould get back to what they were doing.  <br/>\n <br/>\nTo my oldest sons, it seemed like they were learning &quot;tricks&quot; at  first.  <br/>\nThey didn&#39;t want to make him cry, because they loved  him.  They soon realized <br/>\nthese weren&#39;t actually tricks and wouldn&#39;t  work for long because the baby <br/>\nadapted and the boys had to learn new ways to get  what they wanted while they <br/>\nplayed.  They couldn&#39;t be fake or obvious with  him, because they realized he <br/>\nknew.  He amazed them with how much he knew  and could learn, and so they spent <br/>\ntime trying to teach him new things and  playing with him.  Kind of like he was <br/>\na toy, at first, but then it  became a relationship, as he started toddling <br/>\naround.<br/>\n <br/>\nI will say that my middle and youngest (9 years apart) reached a point  when <br/>\nthe middle was about 14 or 15 where they were like oil and water.  I  could no <br/>\nlonger allow them to be at home alone together.  I really can&#39;t  say the <br/>\nyounger one was an instigator, ever.  He was just being 5 or 6, but  the older one <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t take it.  Low tolerance.  It was an awful time  there for a while.  <br/>\nI just kept them apart as much as possible until the  older one could mellow <br/>\nout.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI think it&#39;s a good idea to apologize to your son for the way you treated  <br/>\nhim earlier (I&#39;ve done that).

Ask him why <br/>\nhe thinks it&#39;s okay to treat her that way; what&#39;s going through his  mind <br/>\nwhich leads to the words, etc.  Demonstrate a loving relationship with  him, and <br/>\nshow him how to pass it on to his sister.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s worth it.<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152335345,"authorName":"Diana Tashjian","from":"&quot;Diana Tashjian&quot; &lt;dtashjian@...&gt;","profile":"d_tashjian","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Being the adult was: RE:otterpop advice","postDate":"1119496573","msgId":106951,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNzcwMWM1NzdhMSRlOTgzMTg5MCQ2NTAzYThjMEBqb2huPg==","referencesHeader":"PGQ5ZDk2OCt1anRnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":106950,"nextInTopic":106953,"prevInTime":106950,"nextInTime":106952,"topicId":106920,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Another thing I wondered about was whether or not Michael is feeling like he gets his share of attention, etc. I think sometimes it s hard for the older kids","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2049471432\">Another thing I wondered about was whether or not Michael is feeling <br/>\nlike he gets his share of attention, etc. I think sometimes it&#39;s hard <br/>\nfor the older kids who might feel like there are double standards in <br/>\nhow they&#39;re supposed to behave versus the younger kids.

I think that as kids <br/>\nget older, they watch a little more. They notice how effective our <br/>\nparenting is. And, in our case, he thinks I&#39;m not being very <br/>\neffective. &lt;g&gt; He thinks that Alyssa is &quot;getting away with&quot; all <br/>\nkinds of things. And he thinks he can correct the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of during the heat of the moment, I pulled Michael aside and <br/>\nsaid, &quot;I know you&#39;re trying to help me, but it&#39;s not really helping. <br/>\nInstead, it makes Alyssa feel like we&#39;re ganging up on her, and then <br/>\nwe have another problem starting up. So, even though you think I&#39;m <br/>\nnot doing a great job, I need you to keep your thoughts to yourself <br/>\nand come to me afterwards if you have suggestions or ideas. You&#39;re <br/>\nher brother, not her parent.&quot; Like Sandra said, sometimes it&#39;s more <br/>\nof a knee-jerk reaction on his part. And that just means it&#39;s a bad <br/>\nhabit that needs work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething I just thought of... maybe I should have a conversation <br/>\nwith Michael about the coolness of being &quot;the big brother.&quot; How <br/>\nyounger siblings might be more open to older sibling advice at <br/>\nquieter times. And, I would think it might have a big impact - maybe <br/>\neven a great sibling-bonding kind of conversation. Although this <br/>\nwill have to wait, since Michael is in Japan for the summer. sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts...<br/>\nSue</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Being the adult was: RE:otterpop advice","postDate":"1119466537","msgId":106922,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxOTdkNGQwY2Y3Y2UyODQ1MThmNjc3NDliNDA2YTk0QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDZBRTU2MDgzLUE2MTctNEY0Mi1CREVELTUyREE4RDMxNEUyNEBtY2hzaS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGFlLjc0YjI2M2ZhLjJmZWEwMWQ5QGFvbC5jb20+IDw2QUU1NjA4My1BNjE3LTRGNDItQkRFRC01MkRBOEQzMTRFMjRAbWNoc2kuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":106920,"nextInTopic":106938,"prevInTime":106921,"nextInTime":106923,"topicId":106920,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
