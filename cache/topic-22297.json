Authorities believe McGuckin, 46, is mentally ill. Her husband <br/>\ndied more than a week ago, Jarvis said.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther information on the warrant was not immediately available.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We know there are six children in there and guns in the house. The <br/>\nkids are trained to use the guns,&quot; Jarvis said. &quot;We&#39;ve been working <br/>\nfor four or five days trying to figure out how to get the mom off the <br/>\nproperty and get her in a mental hold.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMcGuckin owns 27 dogs, which have been running free and hunting as a <br/>\npack in the area, Jarvis said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They hunt. They pack like wild animals,&quot; Jarvis said. &quot;They took <br/>\ndown a moose a little while ago.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOn May 21, the dogs attacked a woman who was walking near the house, <br/>\nJarvis said. Stephanie Almy suffered bites requiring 17 stitches, and <br/>\na deputy who rescued her was also bitten.<br/>\n<br/>\nMcGuckin retreated into the house and agreed to put all the dogs in <br/>\nthe basement, except two. She refused to come out of the house <br/>\nanymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe home lacks power, water and heat. The children are in the care of <br/>\ntheir 16-year-old sister, Jarvis said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve been home-schooled, he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nA 19-year-old sister who left home some time ago has been assisting <br/>\nthe sheriff&#39;s department.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe family is &quot;absolutely stone broke,&quot; Jarvis said. Deputies <br/>\ndeveloped a plan to bring McGuckin some money, thinking she might <br/>\nleave the house to get groceries.<br/>\n<br/>\nA deputy delivered the money Tuesday and McGuckin agreed to go with <br/>\nhim to Garfield Bay to make the call. At about 4 p.m. Tuesday, <br/>\nMcGuckin was taken into custody at Garfield Bay.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeputies returned to the home to get the children and put them in the <br/>\ncustody of state Department of Health and Welfare.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a deputy was explaining the situation to the 15-year-old boy, he <br/>\n&quot;runs back to the house and yells, `Get the guns,&#39;&quot; Jarvis said. <br/>\n&quot;They let all the dogs out of the basement. The dogs were attacking <br/>\nagain.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter warding off the dogs with gunshots, officers used a loudspeaker <br/>\nto try to talk the kids out of the house.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We were trying to convince them that we weren&#39;t there to hurt them, <br/>\nand that we were there to assist them, to get them housing and food,&quot; <br/>\nJarvis said.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt about 7 p.m., the officers left.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The children are no worse than they were night before last,&quot; Jarvis <br/>\nsaid. &quot;They&#39;re in the care of their 16-year-old sister.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nÂ© 1998-2001 Seattle Post-Intelligencer<br/>\n--- End forwarded message --- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22132,"nextTopicId":22046}}
