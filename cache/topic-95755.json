But, for a couple of years of<br/>\npart-time work, which paid for him to travel a great deal, he stuck with<br/>\nit. Then, it finally hit him just a few weeks ago that this was not<br/>\nanything which really spoke to him, nor made his heart sing, nor stimulated<br/>\nhim in any real way. So, he and I talked about it at length and he quit. He<br/>\ndecided that the idea of working with kids appealed to him and so he put<br/>\ntogether a summer adventure camp for young kids . . . music, games, crafts,<br/>\nand such . . . and got 6 kids enrolled at $200 each for a five week<br/>\nprogram, two days a week! He is thrilled and is doing a theme each week -<br/>\npirates, knights, wizards, etc. Today was his first day and it was a total<br/>\nhit! <br/>\n<br/>\nNell (17) has done similar camps here for little girls in past summers - as<br/>\ndrama camps . . . her heartsong. Also very lucrative.<br/>\n<br/>\nBay (13) has just landed a job helping a local guy who runs motocross tours<br/>\nfor visitors - he&#39;s washing and assisting in maintenance on the dirtbikes<br/>\n(his passion).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, all of my teens are insistent that the work be relevant to them, which<br/>\nI admire and support. I never really thought that way until I was much<br/>\nolder!
