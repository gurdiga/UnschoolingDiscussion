Questions can be read for non-readers.  It<br/>\njust poses some questions to answer no right or wrong answers - just what<br/>\nthat person thinks.  My 11 yo , 5 yo and myself played it for the first time<br/>\nthe other day.  Everyone has to promise not to say anything when it is some<br/>\none else&#39;s turn, but after the game is over anyone can comment or disscus<br/>\nopenly.  The game can be as long or as short as any one wants.  It has 2<br/>\ndecks - the 1st one is good for starters and younger players.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust one suggestion.

A kitchen timer <br/>\nset to 30 seconds or something could mark the point at which the leader goes <br/>\nto the back but the line keeps moving.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s too small a group for Red Lion or another of the similar tag games.  <br/>\nThose are not totally cooperative, and there is a winner, but it&#39;s quick and <br/>\n&quot;fair.&quot;  Here&#39;s how it works.  There is a base (den) and one &quot;it&quot; (lion).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s another base, and everyone else comes to the edge of the den and <br/>\nrecites this:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Red lion, red lion, come out of your den<br/>\nWhoever you catch will be one of your men.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lion is at the back of the den (out of reach by a step or two) and on the <br/>\nword &quot;men,&quot; the runners run and the lion chases.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt *should* be catch instead of tag, and if your kids will tolerate that <br/>\npolitely that&#39;s a better way.  But if you play tag that&#39;s fine too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoever&#39;s tagged goes back with the lion, those left recite the starting <br/>\nverse, and when only one is left, that child is the new lion and the game <br/>\ncontinues without a pause.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good for getting kids tired, if you need to get them a little tired <br/>\nbefore some more still activity.  And it&#39;s good for getting adrenaline out if <br/>\nthey&#39;ve been getting grouchy and someone has building up a charge which could <br/>\nresult in some physical expression you&#39;d all like to avoid.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------<br/>\nAnother &quot;lion&quot; game we&#39;ve used is much quieter.  We call it &quot;dead pirates&quot; <br/>\nhere, but the book we found it in called it &quot;dead lions&quot; I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne person is it.  Find a shady place, or indoor on carpet place, and <br/>\neveryone should lie down, not touching, and not so close that others can&#39;t <br/>\nwalk.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey get still and quiet and pretend to be asleep.  The one who is it tries <br/>\nto make them laugh, by saying things, making noises, telling jokes, just <br/>\nanything, while walking around them.  When one smiles or laughs or looks, <br/>\nhe&#39;s one of the speakers too, and the last one still and quiet is the first <br/>\none it for the next round.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoms can play that too, and Red Lion, too (if they&#39;re energetic moms).  <br/>\nFollow the leader doesn&#39;t work as well with moms if you&#39;re using a playground <br/>\n(unless you have a young, small mom who can get through kid-sized spaces).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] HELP! non competitive  learning games  & activities","postDate":"1021049348","msgId":36967,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDUxMDA5NDYzOC4wMjk0ZmJjMEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PGFiZ3BlNituNHVzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36965,"nextInTopic":36972,"prevInTime":36966,"nextInTime":36968,"topicId":36960,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
