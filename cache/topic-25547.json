Selling their<br/>\nposessions and goods, they gave to every one who had need. Acts 2:44-45<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the believers were one in heart and mind. no one clamied any of his<br/>\nposessions was his own., but they shared everything they had. with great<br/>\npower the apostles continued to testify to the ressurection of the Lord<br/>\nJesus and much grace was upon them all. There were no needy persons among<br/>\nthem. From time to time those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought<br/>\nthe money from the sales and put it at the aposles feet, and it was<br/>\ndistributed to anyone as he had need. Acts 4:32-35<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody should seek his own good, but the good of others. I Corinthians 10:24<br/>\n<br/>\nEach of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the<br/>\ninterests of others.
