It is defined in the literature as <br/>\n&quot;look for the good in all things, places, people and nature&quot; (something like <br/>\nthat).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe could do crafts and focus on art, but we do crafts almost all the time.  <br/>\nWill thinks we need a game, which the kids always love.  I&#39;m coming up empty. <br/>\n A game that wouldn&#39;t require a whole bunch of pieces and not storebought <br/>\nwould be ideal.  Websites with games ideas for learning would be great, too!<br/>\n<br/>\nI want the kids to get the idea that beauty is subjective in some ways, but <br/>\nobjective in others.  Any discussion on this topic will be helpful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I need it by tomorrow morning at 10:00.  ;)  <br/>\n<br/>\nTIA,<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54358,"nextTopicId":54550}}
