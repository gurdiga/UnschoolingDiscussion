She didn&#39;t say &#39;I&#39;m proud&#39;, but it was close. She still does this sometimes and she&#39;s 82 and I&#39;m 44. It drives me crazy and I think it is manipulative. Well, not now maybe but when I was a child it was the other side of critical control. I agree with Pam that it didn&#39;t help me know myself better. <br/>\nWith my kids, I am trying to avoid that and have used &#39;good job&#39; instead. But now, from listening to you guys, I realize that could be going down the same path so am trying to find other ways. One thing I&#39;ve used is &#39;I&#39;ll bet you&#39;re proud of yourself&#39;. Hmmm...now I&#39;ll have to rethink that one too. <br/>\nOn sort of the same tack,  I need to find new ways to respond to my kid&#39;s ideas. Yesterday in the car my 14dd said &#39;Meg and Sam and I might start a band&#39;. And I asked her some questions about it and said,&#39; well, how often would you guys need to meet&#39; (we live in the boonies and distance has been an issue). And she rolls her eyes and says &#39;mom, they don&#39;t even know how to play the guitar yet&#39;. <br/>\nSo I turned to her and said &#39;I do that all the time, don&#39;t I?&#39;<br/>\nShe said &#39;Well, yeah, a lot&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\nGuess I was way ahead of her and it became more my thing than hers.........sigh......I&#39;ve got to stop getting so excited when my kids take an interest in something. <br/>\nMaybe that is close to getting praised for doing something &#39;approved of&#39;, like my mom did. <br/>\nDoes it betray a lack of confidence on my part that they will find passions? I think so. <br/>\nSorry to ramble and reflect this way.
