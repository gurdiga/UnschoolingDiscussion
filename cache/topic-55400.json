One or <br/>\ntwo said &quot;clapping song&quot; (that would be like &quot;Hey, hey, say playmate, come <br/>\nout and play with me...&quot; or &quot;I had a little sister, her name was Suzi Q...&quot;). <br/>\n All those versions had &quot;auntie&quot; where the one I learned was &quot;sister.&quot;  <br/>\nTheirs might all be from a common source.  Or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a collection of books on kids&#39; rhymes and used to read ALL jump rope <br/>\nrhyme books that came out and it was never in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 3-6-9 part was used in a motown-kind-of recording in the 1960&#39;s, called <br/>\n&quot;Clap Clap&quot; and that one does make sense, rhythmically, as a clapping song.   <br/>\nRubber Dolly DEFINITELY has a tune (as do most clapping rhymes, but the <br/>\n3-6-9- part doesn&#39;t have a tune, it&#39;s a chant.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the jump-rope rhymes I ever knew were chanted.  Rhythm and traditional <br/>\nscheme/presentation, but no tune.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo much folklore for most people maybe.  Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause its crossover is bluegrass and kids, I&#39;m thinking maybe it was <br/>\nrecorded pre-WWII and is on somebody&#39;s obscure 78rpm, or maybe it&#39;s just <br/>\npassed down through families who heard their mom singing it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have another my dad&#39;s dad used to sing.  Anyone know this one?  (It would <br/>\nhelp if I could sing it, I know...)  I have asked all my life, and now I <br/>\nwonder if he made it up.  One of my dad&#39;s brothers is still living.  Maybe I <br/>\ncould ask him.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little man bought him a big bass drum<br/>\nBoom Boom Boom<br/>\nWho knows, says he, when the war will come<br/>\nBoom Boom Boom<br/>\nI&#39;m not at all frightened, you understand<br/>\nBut when I&#39;m called to fight for my land<br/>\nI wanna be ready to play in the band<br/>\nBoom Boom Boom<br/>\n<br/>\nHe used to sing it with me sitting on his knee when I was really little and <br/>\nbounce me a little through the whole song, and bigger on the Booms.  And as I <br/>\ngot older I&#39;d always ask him to sing it to me, because it seemed the thing he <br/>\nshould do, and I didn&#39;t want to forget it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55399,"nextTopicId":54896}}
