You pointed out a flaw in the<br/>\nprevious explanation.  Some people like to hear themselves talk.  And for<br/>\nthese people, continuing after everyone else stops makes perfect sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve never observed it to<br/>\n&gt; continue for long.

They can critisize theories.  For example if<br/>\nsomeone offered a theory that &quot;if you don&#39;t respond to trolls, they will<br/>\nnever continue to post&quot; and you remember an example of trolls who like to<br/>\nhear themselves talk posting and posting, you could falsify the quiet-troll<br/>\ntheory by pointing to your observation.  For the quiet-troll theory to<br/>\nsurvive, it would need to be changed to include an explanation of the<br/>\ncontrary trolls.  (Technically the quiet-troll theory is dead and this<br/>\nwould be quiet-troll theory 1.001a  A similar theory, but not the same one)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36226,"nextTopicId":36354}}
