Processing time, or whatever.  Is it possible your<br/>\ndaughter is just between interests at the moment?<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that lots of my son&#39;s ideas come as outgrowths (sometimes very odd<br/>\nones...) of things we do together.  When he complains of being bored,<br/>\nsometimes I stop and think that we really haven&#39;t been doing much lately.<br/>\nSo we plan a trip, or pull our a new puzzle or an old game, or whatever.<br/>\nEventually something seems to catch on and pull him out of the rut.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read a couple of the Classical Education (also called Thomas Jefferson<br/>\nEducation) books a while back, and besides realizing that I could never do<br/>\nthat -- I don&#39;t have the patience for that approach, I really liked a point<br/>\nthat the author made.  His response to parents who complained that their<br/>\nchildren weren&#39;t interested in math or didn&#39;t like reading it was to ask<br/>\nwhen *they* had last read some Euclidian Geometry or such.  It reminded me<br/>\nto think about what I&#39;m doing myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, there are all sorts of things she&#39;s learning from &quot;just playing<br/>\nall day&quot;, too.  Kid&#39;s work is play.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42748,"nextTopicId":42808}}
