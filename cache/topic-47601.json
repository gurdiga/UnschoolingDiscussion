I&#39;ve deleted a lot, but most seem to address me and ask things of me in particular. Ho Hum. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also noticed that the spaces don&#39;t always appear, and wondered why. Anyone have any ideas? I enter at least twice before and after, and usually have a good inch space on my screen before I send it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your suggestions. Yes, I am DEFINITELY learning. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n  Myranda,<br/>\n<br/>\n  How about an idea that might help you?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I went back and counted.  I&#39;ve written 12 emails to this list in the last 2<br/>\n  days.  I think that&#39;s a record for me.  I have no idea how many you&#39;ve<br/>\n  written, but I know it&#39;s been a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think part of the problem you&#39;re having about accuracy is related to sheer<br/>\n  quantity of email.  Not every single reply to something you&#39;ve said needs an<br/>\n  answer.  The quantity of mail would be horrendous if everybody replied that<br/>\n  many times.  (It&#39;s already pretty heavy today!)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe it would help if you read email in blocks (getting on digest helps for<br/>\n  that) and then answered those messages that you really felt needed an<br/>\n  answer.  I find that when I read a bunch, then write, I&#39;ve had time to<br/>\n  think, and I benefit from having heard other folks&#39; perspectives as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n  On a personal note, I find it easier to read your posts when you space<br/>\n  between quotes and commentary.  That helps me.  The ones that run together<br/>\n  are tough to read. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I hope you are learning and growing from your reading here.
