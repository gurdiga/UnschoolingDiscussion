I was too tierd to get up and fix it. You are definitely right<br/>\nthat not everyone knows what it is, and hence couldn&#39;t ask directly about<br/>\nit. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that because of the mind frame of the Western culture, <br/>\nhomeopathy is considered only a medical science. Even Hahnemann, the <br/>\nfather of modern homeopathy, used the term &quot;Medical Art,&quot; perhaps trying <br/>\nto convey that it was more than just another medical practice. In the <br/>\nWest we don&#39;t have a concept like say, &quot;Ayurveda,&quot; which means &quot;Science <br/>\nof Life,&quot; and encompasses more than the &quot;medical&quot; aspect of life. It is <br/>\na more holistic and true way of expressing what Ayurveda focuses on. <br/>\nUnfortunately, we don&#39;t have a better term to convey what homeopathy is <br/>\nin a more holistic manner. Not that it does not treat (and cure) people <br/>\nwith severe diseases, but its focus is not only the &quot;removal of <br/>\ndisease,&quot; but the fulfilment of the individual.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I&#39;m assuming you LIKE being here and have things to say. Joyce has <br/>\nmade it clear that you are welcome, and merely asked you to think about <br/>\nyour style. I haven&#39;t<br/>\ninsinuated that you shouldn&#39;t post, and it wouldn&#39;t be my place to do so<br/>\nanyway.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy last posts were for clarity&#39;s sake only. I go to the yahoo site every <br/>\nnow and then, and check the posts or threads that catch my attention. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have time to follow all of them. I had more time around Chritmas, <br/>\nbut now I don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like it better if I feel I can participate, of course...  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Lotus Therapeutics -<br/>\nAyurveda, Homeopathy, Yoga & Therapeutic Massage<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com\">http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDhyanyoga Center of NC -<br/>\nMeditation - Kundalini Maha Yoga<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dyc-nc.org\">http://www.dyc-nc.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nThe fruit of silence is prayer.
