One of the butchers developed a little crush on me. Whenever we went in, he would leave his counter and walk around the store with me. He ignored my kids. Usually, he didn&#39;t acknowledge them w/ anything more than a nod. One day, my youngest, JL, asked him a question - point blank. The guy ignored - totally! JL asked again. Again, he was ignored. His sister, my oldest ( she was around 5-6; said &quot;Excuse me, Mr. Butcher Man. Our Mommy isn&#39;t going to go out with you&quot; Well, that got his attention. He looked down at her - my two kids were looking right up at him.

We see so much of that. How can kids think well of themselves if their parents accept other folks disrespecting them??<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, let me get off my soap box before I trip and hurt myself!<br/>\n<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mc1mommy@...\">mc1mommy@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, May 17, 2003 9:27 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] annoying neighbor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;As we&#39;re speaking of conversation and interrupting;<br/>\n  &gt; Our problem is different.....but a major annoyance<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; The problem we have here - our neighbor upstairs has Aspergers - he&#39;s a <br/>\n  &gt; text book case!<br/>\n  &gt; He interrupts constantly - really.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Janis--<br/>\n    I imagine it IS annoying to constantly be interrupted.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;He&#39;s been at our powwow tent - and walked up to me while a customer was <br/>\n  speaking - as soon as there&#39;s any pause - like someone asked a question and <br/>\n  someone else hasn&#39;t actually started to speak - he talks.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I&#39;ve read everything I could get my eyes on concerning autism.
