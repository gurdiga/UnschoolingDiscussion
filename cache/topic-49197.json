Especially when his emotional development seems to be behind his sister&#39;s.  I&#39;m thinking that within 2 years or so they&#39;ll be fine to hang out alone for a little bit, maybe as dh and I go for a short walk to something. <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway,  that&#39;s where we are on it.<br/>\n <br/>\nTake Care,<br/>\nKelli<br/>\n susan marie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scribblers2@...\">scribblers2@...</a>&gt; wrote:How old is he?

So I let him stay, while we go do whatever. He&#39;s never been left longer than 20 minutes, and I&#39;m almost always within sight of the house. I always tell him which direction I&#39;m going, so he can come get me or join us if he wants to. So far, he&#39;s never done anything he shouldn&#39;t or anything dangerous, and if he keeps it up, I imagine I&#39;d be able to leave him alone for trips to the store, etc in a couple of years. I&#39;d never ask him to be responsible for someone else, though. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: susan marie <br/>\n  How old is he?

My son Dillon is almost 10 and often seems to already be an adolescent.  He seems angry a lot, asks us to give away his younger sister, Emma, who is 6.  Dillon has always been outgoing, emotional and affectionate and was very needy as a baby.  Now he yells a lot, has trouble with his temper but never hits.  He just flies off into rages, especially towards Emma.  He acts as though we are the enemy and constantly tells us that we just don&#39;t get it.  We continue to tell him that we will not let him speak to us or others in such an ugly voice.  (See why I think he&#39;s hormonal but think it&#39;s too early?)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot so awfully long ago the kids could play together all day really well.  Now they play together really well about 30% of the day, the rest of the day they are fussing, or Dillon is.  He&#39;s also recently begun watching lots more TV than usual.  He used to watch 1 or 2 shows then shut it off.  Now he will watch all day and even plans his days around favorite shows. There are not any other kids around for them to play with, either together or separately.  We have 1 neighbor close enough to walk but they are rarely home, are in PS.  Their best friends are about 25-30 minutes away (we are in a very rural area of VA) and are siblings also, so it&#39;s hard to let Dillon do things without his sister.  We manage to on occasion, but I realize he&#39;s needs more time away from family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking that all of this is normal developmental stuff, sibling stuff.  I just have a problem dealing with it.  I&#39;ve talked to them both, and to him alone, about how we seem unhappy so much these days.  I&#39;ve taught him deep breathing exercises and point out times to use them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also added stress in our lives since I too broke my leg, and am more needy and unable to take care of things like I usually do.  Mine is the right leg, so I cannot drive which is a big problem.  But Dad has jumped right in to do what I cannot and the kids have really been great helping out.  I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s my leg.....I think it&#39;s Dillon&#39;s personality and his growing up. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas....suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] When the kids don&#39;t seem to need you...and other concerns","postDate":"1036597129","msgId":49219,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMTA2MTUzODQ5LjI4NzEwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTEwLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGI0LjE0OTVhNDk4LjJhZjllMDZjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49199,"nextInTopic":49224,"prevInTime":49218,"nextInTime":49220,"topicId":49197,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*The point comes when it gets harder to do a whole family thing.* This is where we are also struggling,  we are doing fun things outside or going to concerts","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1457758561\">*The point comes when it gets harder to do a whole family thing.*<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where we are also struggling,  we are doing fun things outside or going to concerts and such and my ds(9) would rather just do the PS2.

I don&#39;t know.  We were able to watch TV when ever we wanted, but then that&#39;s all we did. And when my kids are there that&#39;s all they do.  I suppose this was neglect?  Again, I don&#39;t know, just thinking on my computer. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this is where an addictive personality come into play? <br/>\n<br/>\nKelli  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\nIn a message dated 11/5/02 5:22:48 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott-wecht@...\">scott-wecht@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Do you worry when one child seems to control the &quot;to do&quot; list of the <br/>\nday? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it happens.
