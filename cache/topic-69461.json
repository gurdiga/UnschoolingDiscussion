But, what Mary said (above) is exactly how my kids feel too.   I asked <br/>\nLandon and Anna, why don&#39;t you guys smoke?   I said, &quot;I mean, really, I never <br/>\nworry about it, maybe I should&quot;  Landon said, &quot;Mom, your kids are not going <br/>\nto smoke because we are smart.   Only stupid people smoke, smoking is just..<br/>\n.... stupid&quot;  I said.. &quot;well, your Grandpa Blalock smoked&quot;  Landon said, <br/>\n&quot;uhh, well, he also just died, I loved him, but.. well, smoking is stupid&quot;  <br/>\nThen, Landon said.. &quot;Stephen King smokes... (long pause)  .. I guess he is <br/>\nstupid too, in that regard&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I think smoking is stupid too.  I think alcohol abuse is stupid.  I <br/>\nthink drug abuse is stupid.   Landon attributes a lot of &quot;peer pressure <br/>\ninduced stupidity&quot; to &quot;weak minds&quot;   He thinks kids who can&#39;t handle peer <br/>\npressure or just the stuff life hands out are weak and .. well , stupid.   I <br/>\nhave made some pretty dumb choices in my life, BUT, I always recognized the <br/>\nstupidity of my mistakes and learned to TRY to  not make them again.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile we were at the beach this week, a college age girl came down to the <br/>\npool.  She was with a man in his late 40s ( my guess at his age)  She was dog <br/>\ndrunk, couldnt walk without help, was giggling and cackling loudly and  <br/>\nbasically acting like a fool.  Anna said, &quot;Moma, whats wrong with that girl?&quot; <br/>\n I said..&quot;Oh, she is drunk&quot;  Anna watched her for a few more minutes and <br/>\nsaid.. &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right, she IS drunk, she has a drink in her hand&quot;.  I <br/>\nsaid.. &quot;yeah&quot;   Then Anna said.. &quot;GOD, she looks stupid, does she not know <br/>\nhow crazy she looks??&quot; I said, &quot;nah, she probably doesnt even realize.&quot;    <br/>\nAnna said.. &quot; I am never going to get drunk, what is fun about that??, she <br/>\nreally looks like a fool&quot;   I said, &quot;well, yeah, she does, I just hope she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get hurt&quot;.  Anna said &quot;Moma did you ever get drunk before?&quot;  I said. <br/>\n&quot;yeah, a couple of times when I was in high school, and I&#39;m sure I looked <br/>\nstupid too&quot;  She said, &quot;I&#39;m glad I never saw you drunk, cause that would make <br/>\nme feel bad&quot;   I said &quot;Oh, I know, honey, and honestly, it was NOT fun when I <br/>\ngot drunk and I felt like an idiot, thats why I never got drunk again&quot;   She <br/>\nsaid &quot;good&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nLandon was broke tonight, so he went over to a friends house to watch old <br/>\nAnimaniacs videos..  What a hoot.. 16 year olds watching old cartoons..  <br/>\nPretty smart if you ask me :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69452,"nextTopicId":69464}}
