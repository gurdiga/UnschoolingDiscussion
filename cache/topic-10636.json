I did not<br/>\n&quot;boycott&quot;  the movie,   simply did not get around to seeing it.    I have<br/>\nbeen told that the movie was  somewhat &quot;true&quot;  to the book but that , of<br/>\ncourse,  it had to leave out huge subplots and lots of characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent media have different  means of presentation.   In my opinion,<br/>\npart of the greatness of  the book is descriptions----both of surroundings<br/>\nand of Gertie&#39;s thoughts.    Hard to know when a movie is able to portray<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like both the book and movie To Kill a Mockingbird   but ,  in my opinion,<br/>\nthe movie was not at all as successful as the book in portraying the<br/>\ntapestry of differing ways of life and how they intersect.   Focused more on<br/>\nplot and resolution  and was forced to simplify characters.   Still a good<br/>\nmovie.<br/>\n<br/>\nVicki</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10649,"nextTopicId":10760}}
