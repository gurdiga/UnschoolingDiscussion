Really, my children<br/>\nare fine - I&#39;m the one just stumbling/bumbling along, learning from their<br/>\nclarity each and every day. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am grateful for many people on this list and their deep and clear<br/>\ncommitment to unschooling and all that brings up in our lives. And, while<br/>\nSandra&#39;s posts are often poignant, this recent one was brilliant and<br/>\nrelevant beyond words.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn aloha, Lee<br/>\nNorth Country Farms<br/>\nAn Eco-Tourism Destination<br/>\nP.O.
