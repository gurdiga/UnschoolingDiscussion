I could have easily been headed the wrong direction and it was<br/>\nclear to everyone I was no longer interested in my parents ideas.  <br/>\nIn order to be emancipated at that time you had to prove employment, and<br/>\nlive on your own.  Maybe it&#39;s different now.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if your friend would actually consider this, ( I don&#39;t think<br/>\nI&#39;d have the stomach for it )  but it might be something she could talk<br/>\nover with her son.  It sounds though that communication is a problem, so<br/>\nthis idea might just sound like a rejection to her son.  It&#39;s hard to<br/>\nsay. <br/>\nShe could find out the legalities of it and let her son know she&#39;d help<br/>\nhim become a &quot;real&quot; adult if this is what he wants.  Let him know what it<br/>\ninvolves ( full time job, whatever )  and see if he&#39;s ready for it. <br/>\nThis sounds like parent/child control issues and emancipation, maybe even<br/>\nthat she&#39;d be willing to support it, gives control to the minor.  It also<br/>\nmakes him legally responsible for himself and his actions.  <br/>\nThis is a tough issue and my only personal knowledge of it is from my<br/>\nyouth.  <br/>\nBecoming a legal adult probably saved me.  It certainly was an eye<br/>\nopening experience for me and although pretty terrifying in the<br/>\nbeginning, exactly the right choice.(for my particular circumstances) <br/>\nDeb L, who&#39;s very disappointed to hear that IQ tests mean nothing and<br/>\nwill now have to find something else to hold over my husband during<br/>\narguments.

My parents (who did a lot wrong but<br/>\ndid this right) would drive me to conventions, or put me on a plane to them,<br/>\nand wave bye.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost everyone was older than me. I was a very cute young thing, and I got<br/>\nhit on. I learned to say &quot;no thanks&quot; to the men and women asking, and they<br/>\ntook no for an answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter science fiction, I was next involved in dog shows. Almost the exact<br/>\nscenario, almost everyone older than me, and I was still pretty cute.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the activity, it&#39;s the people. Some teachers seduce their teenage<br/>\nstudents in high school. Some baseball coaches molest the boys on their<br/>\nteams. Some ministers rape girls in their congregations.
