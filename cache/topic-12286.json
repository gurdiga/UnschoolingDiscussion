Yes it was... THE TV.<br/>\n(g)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlex (6) surprised me at breakfast the other day by asking me about the<br/>\nstory of Macbeth. Through our ensuing conversation, I learned that there<br/>\nhad been something on Arthur about Macbeth.  Also, this week, the movie<br/>\nof choice in the house has been Hercules (Disney).  This was being<br/>\nrequested 2 times a day!  Well, it does have great music and some pretty<br/>\nfunny dialog, so I was roped in each viewing.  This led to some of the<br/>\nfollowing questions from Alex:  Who was Odysseus, who was Pandora (of The<br/>\nBox fame), what was the Trojan Horse, what is Cerebus.  We looked in the<br/>\nencyclopedia for some answers and also got books from the library.  There<br/>\nare some great books for kids about what you would consider &quot;adult<br/>\nstuff&quot;.  Alex has been reading (or read to) about the adventures of<br/>\nOdysseus, the Trojan War, and Greek Mythology.  We also got a kick out of<br/>\nlearning the 12 labors of Hercules and then noticing what was made<br/>\nmention of in the movie.  Also, we got a great book called the Tales of<br/>\nShakespeare, which has some of the plays in a sort of comic book lay out.<br/>\n Very cool.  Yesterday we read Macbeth and Romeo & Juliet.  Alex really<br/>\nliked all the fighting and mayhem.  I wanted to cry at the end of R & J.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this was so long, I just thought it was all way too cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Shelley</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12237,"nextTopicId":12290}}
