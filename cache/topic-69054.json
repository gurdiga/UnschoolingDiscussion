If for your entire<br/>\nlife, you are told when to go to bed, then you probably don&#39;t really know<br/>\nwhat it feels like to be playing or working on something and feel sleepy and<br/>\nrecognize that it&#39;s time to go to bed now before you get *really* tired. I<br/>\nthink most people go through this learning process in college--staying up<br/>\nvery late, getting up and feeling too tired to function in class, etc. It<br/>\nmight take them years by that point to realize what time *they* need to go<br/>\nto sleep in order for their bodies to feel good and rested. But even with<br/>\nkids, it might take weeks or months of the kids going a bit crazy one way or<br/>\nanother for them to discover their own personal sleepy point.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s a very different thing for a child who has always been able to<br/>\ndetermine their own bedtime and can therefore read their own body&#39;s sleep<br/>\ncues. Whenever people come and post &quot;I&#39;ve tried not having a bedtime&quot;, the<br/>\nfirst thing I wonder is &quot;for how long?&quot; If you haven&#39;t given it the weeks or<br/>\nmonths it might take, and go back to enforced bedtimes again, the kids might<br/>\njust have to go through it when they are old enough to move out on their<br/>\nown. That can even be dangerous. We&#39;ve all probably seen the studies about<br/>\nsleep deprivation and auto accidents, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I&#39;ve just won a lifelong battle with insomnia. After 37 years,<br/>\nI&#39;ve *finally* gotten to the point where I can lay my body down when it<br/>\nfeels tired and drop off to sleep. My mom tells the (to her) &quot;humorous&quot;<br/>\nstory of how I used to scream so loud in my crib that my parents had to<br/>\nsleep in the dining room (of a one-bedroom apartment). I know she was<br/>\nprobably following Dr. Spock and doing what she felt was best for me, but<br/>\nthere have been many, many sleepless midnights when I wondered if I could&#39;ve<br/>\nlearned what tired and sleepy felt as a child, maybe I wouldn&#39;t be still<br/>\nreading a book trying to get myself to sleep in the middle of the night.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Bedtime discussions gone wild","postDate":"1052973079","msgId":69137,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwZC4yNDY4ZTZlMi4yYmY0NzIxN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69136,"nextInTopic":69174,"prevInTime":69136,"nextInTime":69138,"topicId":69054,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/14/03 7:40:58 PM, patti.schmidt2@verizon.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-767295632\">In a message dated 5/14/03 7:40:58 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patti.schmidt2@...\">patti.schmidt2@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; With the older two I then make Nighty Nite tea for us all and we <br/>\n<br/>\nread from our latest novel.

I&#39;ve learned <br/>\nfrom experience that the &quot;let them drop where they are&quot; approach <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work for my kids, particularly when they&#39;re little.  But <br/>\nthen neither do inflexible bedtimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my latest &quot;routine. &quot; When my youngest is getting sleepy I <br/>\nstart a subtle segue (sp?) into bedtime-related stuff.  A warm bath, <br/>\na snack (usually while in the tub), and picture book selecting.  I <br/>\nusually ask my older two to watch a movie or something else quiet at <br/>\nthis point.  My 4yo and I then brush teeth and get in bed to read a <br/>\nstack of books with a soft light.  I pick some of the books, and he <br/>\npicks some- and the ones I pick are soothing, sleepy type books and <br/>\nI read in a quiet voice.  Then I turn out the light and rub his back <br/>\nand talk in a soothing way about the things we did that day and the <br/>\nthings we&#39;ll do the next day.  This is a cozy time for us, and he <br/>\nfalls asleep happily and quickly.<br/>\nWith the older two I then make Nighty Nite tea for us all and we <br/>\nread from our latest novel.  I tell them ahead of time when I&#39;ll be <br/>\nready so they can finish or pause what they&#39;re doing.  Usually after <br/>\nthis reading session my middle son is happy to be tucked into his <br/>\nbed, sometimes with his gameboy but usually with the lights out and <br/>\na quick backrub.  He&#39;s always been my early bird.<br/>\nMy oldest (night owl since birth) then retreats to his room where <br/>\nhe&#39;s free to do whatever he wants as long as it&#39;s reasonably quiet.  <br/>\nUsually he reads Calvin and Hobbes, plays gameboy or if he&#39;s really <br/>\ntired listens to an audiobook with the lights out in bed until he <br/>\nfalls asleep.  If he doesn&#39;t want to sleep by himself he drags his <br/>\nblanket and pillow into my room and reads a book alongside me until <br/>\nhe falls asleep.  <br/>\nSo I *do* have a bedtime routine that we&#39;re all happy with, and the <br/>\nkids don&#39;t mind it because they know it isn&#39;t arbitrary, nor carved <br/>\nin stone, and they know that if they&#39;re not ready for sleep they are <br/>\nfree to do something else quiet until they are.  This all occurs <br/>\nbetween 8 and 10 usually, which gives me some much needed peace and <br/>\nquiet since if anyone&#39;s still up after that time it&#39;s my mostly self-<br/>\nsufficient oldest.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorks for us. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPatti</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":107434088,"authorName":"becqui","from":"becqui &lt;becqui@...&gt;","profile":"becqui","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Bedtime discussions gone wild","postDate":"1052962593","msgId":69120,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEdNRUVJR0dOSEVPS09MSERHSEZORUVCSUNPQUEuYmVjcXVpQGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGI5dXIzbyt2YTVjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69117,"nextInTopic":69123,"prevInTime":69119,"nextInTime":69121,"topicId":69054,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Patti, Our routine is almost identical to yours but goes on between 11pm and 2 am.
