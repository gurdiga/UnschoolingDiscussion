Salt water cures everything. The <br/>\nsalt + baking soda has something to do with the chemical reaction that <br/>\nhappens. I have to look in a cooking book but I seem to remember that <br/>\nsalt neutralizes the metallic taste of baking soda. Natrium Muriatricum <br/>\n(salt) is used in homeopathy for allergies, eczema, asthma, contact <br/>\ndermatitis, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Everything said not to apply salt directly to your mouth, to mix it <br/>\n&gt; with baking soda or use a damp cloth to rub it gently ito your teeth <br/>\n&gt; and gums<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A lot of it is due to taste issues (at first). The second issue that <br/>\ndoes not become apparent at first is that you can wear off tooth enamel <br/>\nin a short period of time with these abrasives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why whitening toothpaste is evil.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I worked at Colgate-Palmolive, a lot of people would call about <br/>\nsensitivity with those toothpastes. People would go to town believing <br/>\nthat indeed their teeth would look Vanna white when in fact it could <br/>\nonly remove enough build up to get them almost to their natural white <br/>\n(not the unnatural bleached color that is so in vogue in Hollywood). So <br/>\nwe&#39;d send off many people saying, &quot;well, if you had read the box and <br/>\nthe instructions ...&quot; meanwhile knowing all too well that people do not <br/>\ngo by the box but by the commercials. Then we would get once in a while <br/>\nthe letter from a lawyer or a saavy customer with lots of dental <br/>\nrecords to prove that, in effect, our tp had worn down their teeth. Its <br/>\nanother case of cosmeceuticals. Toothpastes are considered drugs by the <br/>\nFDA. So that makes Colgate Palmolive and Procter and Gamble <br/>\npharmaceutical companies. But their business model is that of a <br/>\nhousehold and cosmetics company. So you have different interests within <br/>\nthe same company battling over how products are marketed and packaged. <br/>\nIt made for an interesting 4 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;If it were &quot;an antiseptic,&quot; then pouring salt into one&#39;s wounds <br/>\n&gt; would be a<br/>\n&gt; kindness and not a horrible torture (even if only a proverbial <br/>\n&gt; torture).&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jasons dad used to put salt in the bottom of his lower lip, he had <br/>\n&gt; infected gums  and the salt helped, it cleaned the wound and he said <br/>\n&gt; it got rid of the pain.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He got addicted to the salt though and couldn&#39;t stop, it ended up <br/>\n&gt; eating away a bunch of his teeth and gums, but he said it didn&#39;t hurt. <br/>\n&gt; :-/<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>UGH! WOW! That sounds gross. I can&#39;t imagine how much he must have <br/>\nbrushed for that to happen ?!?!?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n/ l i z a, nyc<br/>\n============================<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://culturekitchen.com\">http://culturekitchen.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liza.typepad.com\">http://liza.typepad.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://typepadistas.com\">http://typepadistas.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82550,"nextTopicId":82102}}
