I would<br/>\ngive the child the tools so that he will learn with the least possible<br/>\nteaching. You say the child is asking to learn; he is not asking to be<br/>\ntaught. The difference is significant.<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently, this child has the motivation -- he&#39;s curious to know what the<br/>\nbooks say. And he has a reason -- he wants to know what the authors are<br/>\ntalking about.  Now the kid needs only one thing: The HOW...How does reading<br/>\nhappen? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe hope that many of us have, I&#39;m sure, is that someone has been reading<br/>\nstories to this child for several years, so that he knows the joys of<br/>\nstories and that it involves turning those marks on the pages into spoken<br/>\nsounds, and that a skill is needed. He wants to acquire the skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, it&#39;s not just books. It&#39;s signs that give helpful instructions<br/>\nlike STOP and DONT WALK, OPEN AT 9am, CLOSED,  or MARKET or PARKING ON<br/>\nWEEKDAYS ONLY, POISON, EXIT,  FAMILY PLANNING: ENTRANCE IN REAR, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n(My wish is that the child will not be told that reading happens by magic,<br/>\neven though learning can be said to be magical at any level. Skill is<br/>\nneeded.)           <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the child knows that the print needs to be deciphered (decoded) in order<br/>\nto turn it into familiar sounds, you&#39;re halfway home. If the child already<br/>\nknows the alphabet, and/or knows that letters have distinct sounds (has<br/>\nphonemic awareness), most of the problem is already solved...he is<br/>\ndefinitely ready to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion is to determine what the child already knows and try to help<br/>\nhim build on that. One way to find out is to get a copy of Cat In the Hat<br/>\n(or something similar with simple regular words...there are hundreds of such<br/>\nchildren&#39;s books) and read it out loud, slowly of course, while he looks at<br/>\nthe pages. Point to the words as you read them. If, while you&#39;re reading,<br/>\nthe child says, &quot;I get it. I can read it now,&quot;  then you&#39;ve done your job<br/>\nfor now. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe breakthrough to reading by a child might be surprisingly quick. That<br/>\ndepends on readiness, motivation, and other factors. If the child is<br/>\nconfident enough of his/her new skill to try to read other books by<br/>\nhim/herself, you can relax even more...s/he&#39;s on the way. Often, children<br/>\nlike to read a familiar book many times over. It seems to give them<br/>\nconfidence in their skills as they gain them.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading different books helps children learn more words as they progress,<br/>\nand requires them to test their skill at decoding unfamiliar words on their<br/>\nown,  but when s/he asks you what a new word is, it&#39;s probably best simply<br/>\nto read the word and let him/her continue (instead of asking him/her to<br/>\nsound it out for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea is for the child to be able to recognize that the letters (for<br/>\nexample, C-A-T) have distinct sounds that make up the words.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere might be questions about capital letters and lower case letters that<br/>\nyou might need to answer, but I would advise against turning a child&#39;s<br/>\nquestions into teaching sessions. My son&#39;s favorite saying was from<br/>\nChurchill who said, I love to learn but I hate being taught. Who doesn&#39;t?<br/>\n...well, not everyone hates it, especially when we&#39;re interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nA curious note: I once read an interview (or was it on the radio?) given by<br/>\nDr. Seuss. In it, he said that his publisher requested that his book, Cat In<br/>\nThe Hat, and several others, contain words that used the most basic<br/>\nprinciples of phonics, and the publisher gave Seuss an actual list of words<br/>\nthat were to be included.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Dr. Seuss (not his real name) was given his honorary degree (Doctor of<br/>\nLetters) from Harvard, he announced that he could now call himself, Dr. Dr.<br/>\nSeuss.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39922,"nextTopicId":39908}}
