(a hard question)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a little discussion on another list that turned to the idea that <br/>\nthere was a group of unschoolers saying who could and couldn&#39;t unschool.  It&#39;s <br/>\nbeen making me think.<br/>\n<br/>\n*****************************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a hard and interesting question.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI am always surprised when someone online reacts as if someone else&#39;s pronouncements online (or anywhere else, really) could have so much weight in the reader&#39;s own life.  It makes no sense to think (as many clearly do) that &quot;can&#39;t unschool&quot; means &quot;we won&#39;t let you&quot; because &quot;we&quot; don&#39;t have that power.  Really -- what could &quot;can&#39;t&quot; unschool mean, but that in the writer&#39;s opinion it won&#39;t work. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut then, what does &quot;won&#39;t work&quot; mean?   What does it mean to say that unschooling is &quot;working.&quot;   For me  &quot;working&quot; has two components  - living a joyful, interesting, wonder-filled life with my children and also allowing them to grow into adults who trust themselves in all matters of living (including learning).  <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah - I do think that certain attitudes/beliefs/constraints would prevent someone from reaching either of those goals. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if &quot;working&quot; just means the (IMO) more conventionally-schooly goal of having children reach the age of 18 having acquired certain skills/information - perhaps ones of the child&#39;s choosing for some people, perhaps not for others.  In this case, then, is unschooling is just a technique of teaching without a curriculum or required activities?   I don&#39;t have any experience or opinion on whether that kind of &quot;unschooling&quot; would &quot;work&quot; to reach that kind of goal or not.  Or whether certain attititudes or beliefs would hinder or help it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis really does seem to come up over and over and over again, doesn&#39;t it?  And I&#39;ve only been reading/posting for about 6 months. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n That unschooling is just a different way of presenting them with the information/experiences needed to acquire those skills/information.  I guess what I am saying -- is &quot;unschooling&quot; merely a technique, independent of goals.
