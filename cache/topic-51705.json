She is a high school teacher of<br/>\nphysics<br/>\n| and thinks physics and maths is the pinnacle of academic<br/>\n| acheivement.

So there the<br/>\nsituation<br/>\n| stands.<br/>\n| She hears nothing that I say, continually &#39;tests&#39; the kids with<br/>\n| questions etc etc, not respecting their rights or my opinions.<br/>\n| Personally I wish she&#39;d never darken my doorstep again (she<br/>\nalso<br/>\n| goes on about my weight, my unfashionable clothes, my hair) but<br/>\n| DH is eager for her to visit and she is his mother and the kids<br/>\n| grandmother.<br/>\n| Any tips for dealing with this ordeal (apart from duct taping<br/>\nher<br/>\n| mouth and sticking er in the closet....)<br/>\n| How have others answered relatives this thick-skinned?<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Shyrley<br/>\n|<br/>\n|<br/>\n| &quot;You laugh at me because I&#39;m different.

I<br/>\nserve as a reminder to help people keep focused on what they presumably want<br/>\nthemselves: discussing unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI trust that people are self-aware enough to see what they&#39;ve done to derail<br/>\nthat goal and mature enough to self-correct. They do it on their own because<br/>\nthey want the forum to stay useful, not because they fear some punishment<br/>\nfrom the authorities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people here I&#39;ve known on lists and message boards for years -- in<br/>\na professional unschooling volunteer capacity you might say :-). I know from<br/>\nthe quality of what they say and the hours they volunteer saying it that<br/>\nthey *are* here to discuss unschooling and help others unschool. I know they<br/>\naren&#39;t here to deliberately hurt people and trust that if they have said<br/>\nsomething hurtful that they recognize their mistake and don&#39;t need someone<br/>\nto pushish or reprimand them. I also am aware that some people&#39;s posting<br/>\nstyles get repeatedly misperceived as personal attack when it is, as they<br/>\nsay, discussion of ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes there are people who have goals other than or in addition to<br/>\ndiscussing unschooling. So another part of my job is to look for patterns of<br/>\ndisruptive behavior that indicate goals that conflict and interfere with the<br/>\nlistmembers&#39; goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough as a moderator I can control *who* posts, none of us can control<br/>\n*what* people post or *how* people post. I can only control what *I* post.<br/>\nIf someone posts something nasty -- or something I interpret as nasty -- I<br/>\nget to choose how I respond. I can stoop to their level or I can be more<br/>\nmature.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the people here and they are really truly trying to be helpful and<br/>\nare not making personal attacks and are discussing ideas. I also know<br/>\neveryone is human and they make mistakes. But presumably we&#39;re all here to<br/>\ndiscuss unschooling so we should refocus on that and get back to it. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\nUnschooling-dotcom moderator</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Mother-In_law","postDate":"1040021178","msgId":51731,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY2OER6QWRyOWVOOEgyQkpxV0EwMDAyMmI4NkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":51717,"nextInTopic":51743,"prevInTime":51730,"nextInTime":51732,"topicId":51705,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
