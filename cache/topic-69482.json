Here are a few.  Our oldest did not mesh with the system from the get go but it took me awhile to &quot;get&quot; it.  I rebelled against hospitals (for birth) and even structured religion (childhood indoctrination).  I don&#39;t know why it took so long to figure this one out. Hubby and I had long talks about how much school was a waste of time and how much we had taught ourselves. I was able/lucky enough &lt;g&gt; to drop my part-time job and focus on undoing the damage.  In the final days, it was:   1. my 5yo not being able to go to the bathroom as needed in K, and the submissive insecurity that she manifested during that year.  2. My 12 yo having communication problems in class with teacher expectations.  (There is much more of this in his history but that is another post).  3. Finally, fed up with wanting to travel (folks in TN) and dealing with getting permission for &quot;missed days&quot;.  Whose kids are they anyway!!!!   Middle child never had a problem.  I am sure the teachers miss him the most!!<br/>\nNow 2 years later going from relaxed to unschooling we have 3 happier kids.  The oldest knows how good he has it now!  He would never go back!!!  The middle is very aware of time wasted and enjoys doing his thing. The youngest for awhile had fond memories of K (Yuck) but yesterday told me she did not want to be a teacher anymore and that school had not been fun!!  Yeah!   I think having contact with homeschool kids for her social needs, and enough contact with PS kids for the contrast has been a good balance.  This may change as she gets older but I am gonna try and keep life as fun and interesting as I can till I can&#39;t keep up with them!!  <br/>\nBeth in MD loving this new way of life and finding more reasons why &quot;unschooling is best&quot; every day!!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69481,"nextTopicId":69460}}
