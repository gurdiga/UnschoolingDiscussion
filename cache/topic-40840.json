There is a concept called<br/>\n&quot;metadiscussion&quot;, i.e. talking about how people are talking.  I am on<br/>\nmany lists where there is a strict ban on metadiscussion, because<br/>\n(as everyone here has seen) once people start criticizing the WAY<br/>\nsomeone posted or the SUBJECT someone posted about rather than<br/>\ndiscussing issues and topics, things generally devolve into acrimony<br/>\nand name-calling.  Here is a sample of the metadiscussion policy from<br/>\none list:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Posting styles are not up for discussion on [this list]. Keep in mind it <br/>\nis not possible for any one person on the [x] list to post in a way which <br/>\ntakes into account everyone&#39;s feelings. It is not OK to challenge or <br/>\ncriticize someone else&#39;s posting style On List. If you feel offended by a <br/>\npost someone sent to the list and you feel a need to let that person know <br/>\nhow offended you are, please do it Off List. If you are offended by the <br/>\n&#39;tone&#39; of the list and you feel you must address this, please address it <br/>\noff list with those who you feel are setting the overall &#39;tone&#39; you <br/>\nperceive. It is not your job to moderate the [x] list.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease do not discuss which [listname] Posts or Topics are Off Topic for <br/>\nthe [x] List on the [x] List. If anyone wants to conduct an email <br/>\ndiscussion of which Posts or Topics are suitable for [this list], how often <br/>\nthese Posts or Topics should come up, and the number of Posts that should <br/>\nbe assigned to a Topic in any given period of time, please take it to <br/>\nprivate email. Please remember that not all Posts or Topics are going to <br/>\ninterest everyone on the [x] List. If you don&#39;t like a Post or Topic or if <br/>\nyou are not interested in a Post or Topic, or if you find the Post or Topic <br/>\ndistasteful, or if you believe the Post or Topic to be Off Topic, or if you <br/>\nbelieve the Post or Topic is too boring, simply make it disappear with the <br/>\nDelete Key. If you are sick and tired of reading Posts or topics which <br/>\nappear to dominate the list, feel free to introduce a new Post containing a <br/>\nNew Topic. If the New Topic doesn&#39;t take off, feel free to keep introducing <br/>\nNew Topics.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been skimming and deleting Ned&#39;s posts, because I&#39;m mostly less<br/>\nthan interested in what he&#39;s been writing about.  But I&#39;ve also been<br/>\nusing the delete key liberally on all the posts DISCUSSING Ned&#39;s<br/>\nposts, because they&#39;re virtually content-free, at least as relates to<br/>\nmy reason for coming to this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here I am, metadiscussing.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-jennifer, mommy to alice the bean, 8/15/97,<br/>\n                and sammy-girl, 6/4/02<br/>\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.beanmom.com/\">http://www.beanmom.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;My motto, as I live and learn,<br/>\n\t  Is dig and be dug in return&quot;<br/>\n\t        -- Langston Hughes</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":115401063,"authorName":"AlmondJoy721@aol.com","from":"AlmondJoy721@...","profile":"almondjoy721","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom]what a newbie thinks of Ned&#39;s posts","postDate":"1029200221","msgId":40840,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI2LmZmOWRhYzEuMmE4OWIzNWRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":40883,"prevInTime":40839,"nextInTime":40841,"topicId":40840,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/12/02 12:54:35 PM, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-767574869\">In a message dated 8/12/02 12:54:35 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; but this particular dynamic bothers me - what the <br/>\nnew people must be thinking about all of this.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNed&#39;s posts are interesting to me until there is a slew of replys ranting <br/>\nabout how they should stop which, frankly, I am not interested in hearing.

You <br/>\nhave been put in a touchy position.   I am glad it is not my decision.  <br/>\nWhatever you  decide, I just wanted you to know I think people (even newbies, <br/>\nspeaking only for myself) can figure out for themselves how to take the posts <br/>\nand choose to read or delete them, or even be insulted by them.  I do not <br/>\nmind choosing .  I think  people who are unschooling or interested in it have <br/>\na certain kind of constitution  about freedom and want to hear many ideas, <br/>\nbut I also see the other side of the coin where one must decide to make <br/>\nchanges in the list forum based on what they percieve as a deviation from <br/>\nwhat was originally intended. As the list owner ultimately that is up to you. <br/>\n  For what it is worth if things continue the way they are I think you will <br/>\nsurely lose more people.  I may or may not be one of them depending on <br/>\nwhether I can take the amount of mail.  I really enjoy the list.  Whatever <br/>\nyou decide is okay with me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJessica</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40825,"nextTopicId":40791}}
