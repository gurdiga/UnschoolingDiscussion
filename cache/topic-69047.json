We have free kids and we haven&#39;t had to decency to move them away <br/>\nfrom mainstream society where their freedom won&#39;t be an attractive nuisance.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Attractive nuisance&quot; is a legal term for dangerous things like swimming <br/>\npools and big trampolines that people might have in their yards.  And you <br/>\nhave a legal obligation to lock them up so others can&#39;t get to them, if you <br/>\ndon&#39;t want the legal responsibility for the damage done by people coming into <br/>\nyour yard against your will and being injured.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaws develop gradually in any case-law situation, and this one crawled up <br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think being an unschooling family in a &quot;normal&quot; neighborhood might be <br/>\nconsidered &quot;an attractive nuisance,&quot; socially.    We have something <br/>\nmesmerizing and the neighbor kids want it.  And they play in it, and they go <br/>\nback home with a profound disappointment they never would have had if our <br/>\nfamilies had been as dour and controlling as theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey might never be happy at home and in school again.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid we MEAN to do this?  I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s kind or good.<br/>\nI think it&#39;s necessary for social change to occur, but there is so much <br/>\nassociated discomfort in the meantime, it honestly makes me sad to think <br/>\nabout its effects on innocent others.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68918,"nextTopicId":69034}}
