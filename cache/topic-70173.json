It<br/>\nis a different enjoyment all together.  Maybe, it makes you feel like<br/>\na kid again when you were always taken care of or maybe it is the<br/>\npleasure of not doing the work!  Either way, I love when someone<br/>\ncooks for me, so I can see why kids love when we pamper them a little.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah it is nice. Maybe that&#39;s why some women just love to go out to eat, no<br/>\none at home will do it for them!!! Then there&#39;s the other side of it and<br/>\npeople like me who also enjoy cooking for others too. I just love having a<br/>\nhouse full and making a homemade dinner for everyone that they enjoy. I<br/>\nespecially enjoy Christmas for that reason. Not just that reason but it&#39;s<br/>\none of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70168,"nextTopicId":70179}}
