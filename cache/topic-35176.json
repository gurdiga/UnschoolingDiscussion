Last <br/>\nnight was the first night of badminton club for the season. The club is <br/>\nrun at the local school, by two teachers, who are into badminton <br/>\nthemselves, but it is not a school activity. I get on well with them, <br/>\nespecially as I have been their most active parent as far as taking <br/>\nturns with supervision! When some more homeschoolers turned up last <br/>\nnight and were asked what &#39;year&#39; they were in they looked completely <br/>\nblank. (We used to have &#39;standards&#39; and &#39;forms&#39; where you have &#39;grades&#39;, <br/>\nbut now have &#39;years&#39; that count from age 5, but the change is so recent <br/>\nthat all homeschool parents went through the old system)  Seeing Hayden <br/>\nlooking confused and slightly panic-stricken, and watching his mother <br/>\nquickly counting in her head, I piped up, &quot;Oh, Celia,&quot; I said, &quot; <br/>\nhomeschoolers don&#39;t worry about that sort of thing, we just go by where <br/>\nour kid&#39;s at in whatever he&#39;s doing.&quot; She replied, &quot;Sorry Hayden, I <br/>\nforgot, oh well, if any one else asks, just tell them you&#39;re year 7&quot; <br/>\n She is such a nice woman :-)  But it is a chance to slide a message in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe homeschool kids were definitely at an advantage at one point, <br/>\nthough. The principal of the school stood up to give the initial talk on <br/>\nhow the club is run, starting with an introduction: &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Malcolm&quot;. <br/>\nHe paused and there was a stunned silence. He continued, &quot;This is the <br/>\nBadminton Club. It is not run by the school, but by the club, and Celia <br/>\nand I are here because we are members of the badminton club, not because <br/>\nwe are teachers. It is important that you recognise that. So. My name is <br/>\nMalcolm.&quot;  One of the oldest kids bravely piped up, &quot;Please Mr Cox, does <br/>\nthat mean we can call you Malcolm?&quot;  Nervous sniggers all round (except <br/>\nfor the homeschooled kids who were looking slightly bewildered at the <br/>\nconversation). &quot;Certainly,&quot; he said. And then went on to talk about warm <br/>\nups, and referees, and where to buy raquets etc. I&#39;m willing to bet that <br/>\nmost of the kids will not be able to call Malcolm anything at all while <br/>\nthey are at badminton! Except, of course, for the homeschooled kids &lt;g&gt; <br/>\nand mine, at least, never though of calling him anything else, all last <br/>\nseason, because that&#39;s what I call him.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\nNew Zealand</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35166,"nextTopicId":35099}}
