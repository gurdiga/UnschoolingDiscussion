Just wonering because we&#39;re not that far from there.<br/>\nLari<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Tina <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, May 11, 2004 4:53 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Boredom<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  You know, I never thought of visiting local businesses.  I guess it&#39;s <br/>\n  just out of my comfort zone, not visiting businesses but the busy-<br/>\n  ness of the city.  What wonderful opportunities we must be missing.  <br/>\n  I never would have thought of it just because I truly detest walking <br/>\n  in my neighborhood.  There are SO many cars!<br/>\n<br/>\n  We live in Roseville, MI right where I-94 and I-696 meet.  We are <br/>\n  surrounded by two expressways, one two lane busy road and one six <br/>\n  lane divided highway.  Our lives are so fast paced that I spend my <br/>\n  time trying to get away from the traffic.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe it&#39;s time for Mom to step out of her comfort zone and venture <br/>\n  into the neighborhood.  Who knows?  Maybe we&#39;ll find something that <br/>\n  we didn&#39;t know was there.  I&#39;m not too confident as there is no down <br/>\n  town persay.  It&#39;s just a through way, but you never know unless you <br/>\n  try, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tina, who won&#39;t miss the city when she leaves :):)<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Alyce&quot; &lt;Groups@V...&gt; <br/>\n  wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; Road trip?  <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Surely, there are interesting shops, businesses, &quot;things&quot; to see?  <br/>\n  &gt; This reminds me of my sister - years ago she lived in an apartment <br/>\n  &gt; and had no yard, but did have a small patio area.  She bought pots, <br/>\n  &gt; dirt, seedlings, etc. and basically had a miniature farm on her <br/>\n  &gt; patio.  I called it the back 40 (more like the back 4).  She sure <br/>\n  &gt; managed to produce some great vegetables and beautiful flowers.  We <br/>\n  &gt; now have an even smaller portion of dirt we call our own.  It&#39;s in <br/>\n  &gt; the corner of our concrete patio... It&#39;s about 3 by 2 feet.  So far <br/>\n  &gt; it&#39;s been used for digging and driving hot wheels cars in.  I&#39;m <br/>\n  &gt; thinking about actually trying to plant something in there... I <br/>\n  have <br/>\n  &gt; a black thumb though.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; I remember when I was a kid in Chicago... quite urban that, I found <br/>\n  &gt; it pretty magical when I saw those plants coming up in the cracks <br/>\n  in <br/>\n  &gt; the sidewalk.  And our thing was walking a couple of blocks to the <br/>\n  &gt; ice cream shop.  Playing on the stoop of the apartment building... <br/>\n  &gt; Going to the big department stores.  I found the city pretty <br/>\n  &gt; entertaining when I was a kid.  Riding the buses and trains.  Oh! <br/>\n  &gt; and going for walks... every block or two you were in a <br/>\n  &gt; different &quot;country&quot; with the way the communities were set up.  <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Great museums there too. I found myself more bored (as a child) <br/>\n  when <br/>\n  &gt; we left the city... I rather miss it now that you bring it up.  <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; What city are you in?<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Alyce<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tina&quot; &lt;zoocrew@w...&gt; <br/>\n  &gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; I like the idea of the list on the refrigerator.
