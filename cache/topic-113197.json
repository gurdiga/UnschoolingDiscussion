I mean, even if there&#39;s another engine at the back of the train,  <br/>\nthat<br/>\nstill so much smaller than all these cars.&quot;-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe engines are very heavy and strong and the cars are relatively  <br/>\nlight.  It&#39;s not about size, it&#39;s about friction.   The mass of the  <br/>\nengine puts weight at the front.  Steel wheels on wheel rails, once  <br/>\nthey&#39;re moving, are easy to keep moving.  It&#39;s easier to keep it  <br/>\nmoving once it is moving that to get it started.<br/>\n<br/>\nWays to help think about it are to look at roller coasters, and also  <br/>\nto think about an engine going by itself, and then an engine with two  <br/>\nor three cars.   Part of the engineering in train engineers is knowing  <br/>\nwhen to speed up or slow down to make best use of the momentum of the  <br/>\ncars behind the engine, and how not to waste fuel.  Like a roller  <br/>\ncoaster, the downhills pick up speed.   Like a roller coaster, the  <br/>\nmost energy/fuel is expended to pull the engine up an incline, but  <br/>\nonce the engine is at the top or level, it&#39;s not nearly as much work  <br/>\nto get other cars to follow!   The engineers will know when a train&#39;s  <br/>\nweight needs two or three engines to pull.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Why ordinary folks like me aren&#39;t qualified to educate their own\tchildren :-)","postDate":"1240032406","msgId":113198,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5RTk2NDk2LjMwOTAxMDNAbWFjLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGM5OTgxYzk0MDkwNDE3MTYzOGwyNThkNDNkZWgzNmNkMGU0MDAxMjBhZTcxQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGM5OTgxYzk0MDkwNDE3MTYzOGwyNThkNDNkZWgzNmNkMGU0MDAxMjBhZTcxQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":113197,"nextInTopic":113199,"prevInTime":113197,"nextInTime":113199,"topicId":113197,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
