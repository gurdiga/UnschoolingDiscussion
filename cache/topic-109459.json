We&#39;ve gone through<br/>\na lot of turmoil in our family over the last couple of years, but nothing<br/>\nlike what you and your family have gone through. It doesn&#39;t make it &quot;all<br/>\nbetter&quot; to talk about it, but I know that empathizing with what they&#39;re<br/>\ngoing through and -- especially -- making it clear that it&#39;s not what I<br/>\nwant, either, seems to have been a help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would encourage the use of the paper plates. I also would encourage a<br/>\nspecial, crisis-mode only set-up where only one or two outfits are worn. The<br/>\nrest of the clothes can be put away for a bit, if there aren&#39;t strong<br/>\nobjections. My 3yo and 9yo would be happy to wear the same outfits every<br/>\nsingle day (my 9yo does just that). I wash it overnight. It could be an<br/>\nadventure. It could get you down to 1 load of wash a day or maybe every<br/>\nother day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regard to the accidents, I swear by Goodnites (or their generic<br/>\ncounterparts). It&#39;s only an issue with one of my children right now, but<br/>\nthat child rewears the nighttime diapers until it needs to be replaced. It<br/>\nmight be more difficult with your children if they&#39;re not used to wearing<br/>\nthings at night. I could see that saving a lot of laundry as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also wondering what everyone is doing all day. Are you able to read to<br/>\nthem? Or do they watch TV? Do they have friends whose mothers would be able<br/>\nto come and get at least one of them to do something fun (plus, they&#39;d be<br/>\nless likely to create any clutter issues in the house).<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen<br/>\nin LA</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":235318765,"authorName":"janddplus5","from":"&quot;janddplus5&quot; &lt;janddplus5@...&gt;","profile":"janddplus5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: kids help around the house","postDate":"1131592171","msgId":109555,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRrdWRsYituNTBkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":109553,"nextInTopic":109557,"prevInTime":109554,"nextInTime":109556,"topicId":109459,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Robyn, Thanks for the suggestions.

I don&#39;t think there is such a thing as disposable clothes, but instead of plates, bowls, cups, etc. invest in paper products. That will cut down on dish doing duties. There will still be the pots and pans to do, but not so much other stuff. Second, if you have tried everyone having their own night to do dishes and everyone is always denying that tonight is their turn, then have each person clear one or two things off the table or stove and wash and dry just those two things. That way everyone does a little and it all gets done. <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know what to say about the laundry... Can everyone wear the same outfit twice? Maybe not two days in a row, but the same thing on Mon. and then again on Thur.? Maybe one kid in charge of washing whites, one in charge of the darks and so on? How about not worrying about folding it all? Give each kid their own basket and when the clothes are clean they are each responsible only for getting the clean clothes  that belong to them into the basket and to their own room. I don&#39;t know how you feel about it, but if its all just jeans and t-shirt type stuff, can it just stay in the basket? If not, then how about one day set aside for laundry? Maybe after it is all dry, put it in a huge pile in the TV room and pop in a movie and everyone sit around folding all that warm, fresh-smelling, clean stuff? (What the kids and I do. &lt;g&gt;) A weeks worth (or more&lt;g&gt;) of laundry all piled up, a good movie... When Darin comes home and I have all of his stuff on top of our things, I take his duffel<br/>\n bag and it gets washed with his jeans. When his clothes are clean I just shove them all back in the bag. He is responsible when he gets back on his truck for folding them all and putting them away.<br/>\n <br/>\nEveryone&#39;s things strewn all over the house? Same thing as the laundry. A basket with each person&#39;s name and for 5-10 minutes at the end of the evening, *everyone*, at the same time, picks up around the house, and puts things in the basket to whom that item belongs to. That means if Suzy finds Billy&#39;s ball, she doesn&#39;t leave it or say &#39;Billy your ball is under the recliner.&#39; it means she picks it up and puts it in his basket. Because he just found her hockey stick behind the couch and put it in her basket. It won&#39;t matter what belongs to who while the picking up is being done, just that it gets done and everyone can then take their basket to their room and put their own things away. And no one has anymore or less to do. Play music really really loud while you are doing this. Something new each night. <br/>\n I guess what I am saying is; try not to turn a chore into a *chore*, make it as fun as possible, make it as less of a chore as you can.

I <br/>\ndo have the advantage that hubby is getting a pay raise in Dec. <br/>\nwhich may enable be to get a maid just for those two specific tasks. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way the children are 11, 9, 7, 6, 5.  They are great help, so <br/>\nI am not really complaining about them.  It is more the situation in <br/>\nwhich they have to more than children should really be having to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are up for orders this month and will probably be moving in May <br/>\nof next year.  I am hoping by then to be better, but if not to at <br/>\nleast be closer to family.  It makes it very difficult when dh can&#39;t <br/>\nbe home.  If he had a civilian job I believe they would have fired <br/>\nhim this summer due to my health issues causing him to have to take <br/>\noff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I am entertaining the idea of all paper plates and plastic ware <br/>\n(the really cheapy stuff) to cut down on so many dishes that need to <br/>\nbe washed.  I am gonna see how economical it is to just have that so <br/>\nthe kids can toss it in the trash when they are done.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am still working on the laundry thing though.  It isn&#39;t too bad if <br/>\nat least 2 loads are done everyday.  It is when someone has an <br/>\naccident and sheets need washed and stuff like that then causes a <br/>\nback up in the loads.  Oh well still hoping for more ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving relatives closer would be awesome cause my MIL is fantastic <br/>\nwhen it comes to helping with that kind of stuff.  But as for now <br/>\nshe lives and works in CT and we are in Florida. Thanks again.<br/>\n<br/>\nDana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] kids help around the house","postDate":"1131571244","msgId":109488,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI1ZS45ZWFkZjQuMzBhM2MyMmNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":109469,"nextInTopic":109492,"prevInTime":109487,"nextInTime":109489,"topicId":109459,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/9/2005 1:24:06 PM Central Standard Time, janddplus5@bellsouth.net writes: Part  of what makes this hard for them is that this last","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-530570839\">In a message dated 11/9/2005 1:24:06 PM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:janddplus5@...\">janddplus5@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPart  of what makes this hard for them is that this last surgery was <br/>\nthe fifth  surgery this summer and it has been especially trying for <br/>\nthem.

Fifth surgery.  oy.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think my first suggestion is to contact the family readiness group (or  <br/>\nwhatever they call it in the Navy) on your base and see if they can help you  <br/>\nfind a volunteer to do some work around the house.  They may know of  other <br/>\nservices that maybe you haven&#39;t thought of, yet.<br/>\n <br/>\nSecondly, I think I wouldn&#39;t expect the kids to be in charge of an entire  <br/>\ntask all at once.  Like, don&#39;t tell an 11 yo to go do the dishes.   Roll your <br/>\nchair into the kitchen and work together with your 11 to get done what  needs to <br/>\nbe done.  Ask for him/her to help you  get x and such done  together.  Most <br/>\nkids don&#39;t have what it takes to be &quot;in charge&quot; of a task  they don&#39;t initiate, <br/>\ndidn&#39;t think up on their own, and have little interest in  doing it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI had a couple of back surgeries, too.  It&#39;s easy to lay up in the bed  and <br/>\nholler to the kids in the next room to do this and such, especially when  <br/>\nyou&#39;re in pain.  I think I&#39;d try to make myself comfortable in the center  of the <br/>\naction as much as possible, so you can direct and ask and interact and  play <br/>\nwith them.  Ask for their help in your recovery, make sure they know  it&#39;s not <br/>\nforever...and ask the people on base for help, too.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":153458693,"authorName":"Barb Lundgren","from":"Barb Lundgren &lt;barb.lundgren@...&gt;","profile":"barb_lundgren","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"kids help around the house","postDate":"1131563629","msgId":109469,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJGOTdBNjhELkNEQjElYmFyYi5sdW5kZ3JlbkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRrdGNrbCtnMWpoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":109459,"nextInTopic":109488,"prevInTime":109468,"nextInTime":109470,"topicId":109459,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dana, What a difficult position you are in... and your kids!
