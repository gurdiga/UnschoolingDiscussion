I have found myself using the word &quot;home-educater&quot; and then I see <br/>\npeople actually thinking a moment to try and figure out just what that might <br/>\nbe.  But if I really think about it, I am really a &quot; home- education <br/>\nco-creator&quot; because it really is a partnership with my daughter not a <br/>\nteacher-student relationship.    But I think if I said that, I might get <br/>\nthose strange looks again!  I guess in the end, I just don&#39;t like labels.  I <br/>\nreally don&#39;t like defining myself or who I am or what I do .  I just am.  And <br/>\nalmost any day with no notice at all, who I am might change.  And that&#39;s the <br/>\nway I like it.  Jackie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7799,"nextTopicId":7797}}
