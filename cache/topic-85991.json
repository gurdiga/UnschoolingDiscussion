My kids absolutely love the kids activities at <br/>\nchurch.  Our church has made kids a priority in that they were going to enjoy <br/>\nchurch.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my oldest kid turned 18, he didn&#39;t want to go to church, that was fine <br/>\nwith us as parents, he&#39;s 18, a grown adult.  I didn&#39;t say a word, I let my <br/>\nfaith speak through my lifestyle.  Yes, I pray to my Lord, but I don&#39;t &quot;plead&quot; to <br/>\nmy kid.  When he came home on break, he assisted in getting his younger <br/>\nbrother and sister to their activities, and he still enjoys the Bible Quiz team and <br/>\nhelps out.<br/>\n<br/>\nPamela in MO<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85958,"nextTopicId":86012}}
