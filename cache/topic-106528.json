She is a creative writer - an<br/>\noutstanding writer. But her academic essays could be more polished and <br/>\nshe makes up the punctuation rules as she goes along, doesn&#39;t really <br/>\nknow why she makes the choices she does.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe never looked at it. Didn&#39;t have time. She DID write quite a few <br/>\npapers for her college courses throughout the semester. She asked for <br/>\nsome proofreading and editing occasionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe took the &quot;Writing Proficiency Exam&quot; that is required of all <br/>\nstudents at her university. It gets scored by three professors - she <br/>\njust got her scores. Each professor scores out of 6 points and she got <br/>\ntwo 6&#39;s and one 5 for 17 out of 18 possible points.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I guess her &quot;intuitive approach&quot; works pretty well.
