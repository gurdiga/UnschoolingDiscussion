Perhaps both.<br/>\n<br/>\nI share the following brief article that appeared yesterday in a Japanese <br/>\nnewspaper not out any kind of shock value, but just to let folks know the <br/>\ntruth of what is happening here in Japan. I apologize in advance if <br/>\nposting this particular story offends anyone&#39;s sensibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, I fear this kind of situation is only the tip of the <br/>\niceberg where public education in Japan is concerned. Hardly a day goes <br/>\nby these days without this kind of depressing story appearing in the <br/>\nJapanese media about severely traumatized schoolchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing left to wonder is: How many other emotionally traumatized <br/>\nJapanese schoolchildren are out there who *never* get their stories into <br/>\nthe papers?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian Covert<br/>\n(KnoK NEWS)<br/>\nin Osaka, Japan<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n[Mainichi Daily News - Thursday, October 5, 2000]<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mainichi.co.jp/english/news/news08.html\">http://www.mainichi.co.jp/english/news/news08.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBalding 12-yr.-old sues over school bullying<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTAKATSUKI, Osaka -- A 12-year-old schoolgirl has filed a 115 million yen <br/>\nsuit against a former classmate&#39;s parents and her school, claiming she <br/>\nlost all her hair due to stress brought about by bullying.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bully allegedly began teasing her and pulling her hair in April 1998, <br/>\nwhen they were fourth graders. In July of the same year, she began losing <br/>\nher hair on her head -- and all of it, plus her eyebrows, came off around <br/>\nNovember.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer doctor said these were symptoms of a disease called intractable <br/>\nmultiple alopecia areata and that it may have been caused by stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nFearing further hassling, she always stayed at the nurse&#39;s office <br/>\nthroughout the third trimester at school. The bullying stopped when the <br/>\nnext school year began as the boy was sent to a different class.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the scars of the alleged bullying remain. Part of her hair is still <br/>\nmissing, and her doctor says there is a possibility it will not grow again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(c) 2000 The Mainichi Newspapers Co.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13609,"nextTopicId":13611}}
