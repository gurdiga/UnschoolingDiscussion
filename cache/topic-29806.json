They used BOGG&#39;s (Board of<br/>\nGovenors Grants) to get the kids enrolled for free and then they would<br/>\n&quot;proctor&quot; the classes.  Because of this abuse of the system, the colleges<br/>\nchanged from no rules to lots of rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich leads to, some of the schools won&#39;t accept anyone under the age of 16.<br/>\nYou will need to check with your school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to defining yourself as a &quot;homeschooler,&quot; that definition does not exist<br/>\nin California.  You are either a private school or you are part of the ps<br/>\nsystem or, in some cases, you are working outside the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are doing an R4, then you list him as a private school student.  The<br/>\ngeneral rule with ps is that until 16 they can&#39;t take more than one class.<br/>\nAfter 16 they can take 2.  That is because of the number of hours required<br/>\nfor the school to collect $$ from the state.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a private school (R4), you are allowed to determine how many classes any<br/>\nof your students are allowed to take.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the schools require that the students take math and English exams<br/>\nbefore they are enrolled.  As a part-time student you shouldn&#39;t need any<br/>\ntranscripts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest that you talk to the registrar, not a counselor and ask for<br/>\nthe specifics that their board of regents require for their school.<br/>\nUnfortunately, most of the counselors aren&#39;t that much help.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: laura90713 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laura90713@...\">laura90713@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, December 10, 2001 11:03 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Attending city college<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My son who is 15 1/2 would like to take a class or two at our local<br/>\n&gt; city college.
