The teenaged <br/>\ndaughter is a little pudgy.  That&#39;s not bad, because she was a fat baby.  The mom <br/>\nwas always, her whole life, fat, and had gastric bypass surgery (risked dying <br/>\nwhile she had a child because our culture is so unforgiving of variations).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve had two more children.  The boy is SKINNY like his dad.  If anyone <br/>\nsaw him in isolation of the family, they might think he never gets to eat.  He <br/>\neats.   The baby, first birthday Monday, is and has been since the day she was <br/>\nborn, round in all parts.  It&#39;s not because she has no willpower, or that <br/>\nshe&#39;s lazy.  She hardly ever sleeps and she&#39;s pulling up on everything and every <br/>\nbody.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have three children.  My husband was fat from birth; I&#39;ve seen the pictures.<br/>\nKirby is the heaviest.  He&#39;s a bit soft in the face, and wears X-Large where <br/>\nMarty wears Large.  Kirby exercises more than anyone here, because he&#39;s <br/>\ninvolved in karate.  He&#39;s not doing karate to lose weight, he does it because he <br/>\nlikes it.  He was there three hours yesterday, because he taught an extra class <br/>\nand took two classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty is in most ways like his dad, physically, but has rarely pudged out as <br/>\nhe&#39;s grown taller.  He weighed himself before getting on the new high-wire <br/>\nbike at the children&#39;s museum, and he was a little over 200 lbs (204?).  He turns <br/>\n15 Wednesday.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly weighed herself there too.  Riders were supposed to be 90 lbs.  We <br/>\nfilled her pockets up with all nearby carkeys and pens; 89 lbs.   She&#39;s nearly as <br/>\ntall as I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of my kids eat for fun or comfort.  They&#39;re confident and comfortable, <br/>\nrarely bored, and they just aren&#39;t huge eaters.  Kirby eats least of all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to limit their food or shame them because of statistics, and <br/>\noften that&#39;s what it boils down to.  And I lost count years ago of the stories <br/>\nof people whose mothers put them on diets when they were ten, and then they <br/>\nwould sneak food at home or other places, and when they were older and felt <br/>\nbereft of their mother&#39;s affection and approval, ate themselves silly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappiness is way more important than people give it credit for being.  Some <br/>\ncan&#39;t begin to imagine it because they&#39;ve confused happiness with money or <br/>\nweight loss or how new their car smells.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77817828,"authorName":"LOWRIEK@aol.com","from":"LOWRIEK@...","profile":"nancylowrie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] RE: Trouble with Dad/obesity and willpower","postDate":"1073631951","msgId":88224,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI3LjRlZjA3ZDRlLjJkMmZhY2NmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":88250,"prevInTime":88223,"nextInTime":88225,"topicId":88224,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 08/01/2004 19:46:34 Pacific Standard Time, ...
