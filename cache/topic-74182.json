I knew I wanted an armband and it is a bit bigger then I made up because detail was important, but doesn&#39;t look gaudy because it isn&#39;t SOLID all the way around. Mine is a honeysuckle vine {my favorite plant/flower} with 6 flowers spaced out all the way around  and in the center hovering above the flowers there&#39;s a butterfly {&quot;she&quot; symbolizes my sister that is missing} and a dragonfly {that&#39;s me} It&#39;s been 20 years so it felt right for me. Kind of a symbol of the communication I have felt between us. :-)<br/>\nAnyway I really like it and that&#39;s what matters. The artist did a great job. The pain wasn&#39;t bad for me but I am highly pain tolerant but she said that the inside of the arm {near or at the armpit } is usually pretty sensitive. <br/>\nBTW, my husband and I have much the same relationship. I am the one who will do something on a whim and he is the more thinking it through type. We just celebrated our 10th Anniv., we were married December 31, 2002. <br/>\nTracy <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nSBC Yahoo!
