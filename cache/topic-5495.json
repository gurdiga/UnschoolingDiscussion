She was<br/>\nasking about a fifth grader, but all of these things can be applied to<br/>\nyour grandson.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Read to him daily, (the Bible, stories, Jr. biographies, fact books,<br/>\npoetry, classics.) listen to different types of music, find fun ways to<br/>\nlearn math, raise some varmints, take nature walks, watch the Discovery<br/>\nchannel (if you get it!), bake cookies, let him write stories, poems or<br/>\nletters to family members, keep an ant farm, raise tadpoles, play on the<br/>\ncomputer, teach him how to use the computer, keep a journal, visit the<br/>\nlibrary, let him help you make dinner, do a craft, draw or paint, visit a<br/>\nmuseum or science center, go to the zoo, visit a farm, go camping, let<br/>\nhim help you with menu planning and grocery shopping, take a class<br/>\ntogether, see a movie, visit relatives, buy a roll or two of film and<br/>\nhave him take pictures of the most interesting things he can find, visit<br/>\nthe beach, teach him how to run a vacuum, the dishwasher, the washer and<br/>\ndryer, and an iron. Grow a garden, flowers, or veggies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is, that there are so many things for you to do with your son,<br/>\nthat there isn&#39;t a public school student alive who will benefit more than<br/>\nyour child. Work on your relationship with him, helping him to grow<br/>\nmorally strong. Teach him how to treat girls, and how he should treat his<br/>\nwife one day. Help him to develop a strong work ethic. <br/>\n<br/>\nI initially was very concerned with teaching to the ps scope and<br/>\nsequence, but have since changed my thinking on that. Now, when I think<br/>\nof the things I want my children to learn, I have a whole different set<br/>\nof standards. I want them to love learning, to have a personal<br/>\nrelationship with Jesus, to know the Bible intimately, to have a general<br/>\nunderstanding of the way the world works. I think children should be<br/>\nexposed to classical music, literature, and biographies of people of<br/>\nmerit and honor. (This has been difficult to follow through with as the<br/>\nlibrary is chock full of bio&#39;s on sports figures, rock and film stars) I<br/>\nwant my kids to have a strong base in mathematics, and be able to run a<br/>\nhousehold singlehandedly, (even our son). I want them to learn<br/>\ndiscipline, honesty, and consideration for others, and have a strong work<br/>\nethic. I want them to have an appreciation for nature, living creatures,<br/>\nand for their freedoms. I want them to thank God without ceasing for the<br/>\nmany blessings in their lives, and live life with a positive attitude. I<br/>\nwant them to keep themselves fit and healthy, and take care of their<br/>\nfamilies. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hope this helps a little Karol!
