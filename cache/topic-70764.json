We do this sometimes. <br/>\nI&#39;ll say I love you bigger than the moon, and she&#39;ll say I love you <br/>\nbigger than a rainbow. Yesterday she was coaching me, telling me <br/>\nafter she says how big she loves me, I have to say &quot;No, way, who zay&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know who has been telling her no way, Jose, probably my <br/>\nsister. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got to ride in daddy&#39;s big ole red Jeep pickup, which gave us <br/>\nopportunities to talk like we don&#39;t normally get to because the Vulva<br/>\n(volvo) has airbags and the kids are in the back. One of the best <br/>\nthings is my 10yo being big enough to ride up front with me in the <br/>\nVolvo, I longed for her to ride up with me and hold hands and talk <br/>\nwhen she was younger and I felt like a taxi-driver as she was an only <br/>\nchild for seven years. We had a great time bouncing down the highway <br/>\nin that old red pickup, sometimes the three year old sings the <br/>\nSanford and Son tune as we drive LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nAng, insomniac and jabber-mouth as we are putting on a new roof this <br/>\nweekend.
