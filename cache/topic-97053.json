I do have to stay home some days and clean up some so we can enjoy<br/>\nour home.  On those days, there is lots of bickering.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never really realized it until now, but that&#39;s how it is in my home<br/>\nalso. I will have to give alot of thought to this! Start making life more<br/>\nfun for the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Also--and I think that this is part of why I&#39;m finding things so<br/>\noverwhelming lately--my youngest is really getting around well now, and into<br/>\nEVERYTHING.  I now cannot have any chairs at the dining room table, unless<br/>\nwe are eating or someone is already sitting in them, because he will climb<br/>\nup there over and over again, relentlessly!  He also wants to make art with<br/>\nthe girls, but always ends up eating the supplies.  Now that he&#39;s able to<br/>\nget up on the table so easily, they are having a hard time finding a place<br/>\nto create that he can&#39;t interrupt.  I have to keep after him and console him<br/>\nwhen he is thwarted yet again!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh wow, that is about my biggest problem also! My youngest is 21 months and<br/>\nshe is up on the table if my back is turned. I have to bring her to the<br/>\nbathroom with me so she doesn&#39;t crack her head! Sometimes the oldest will<br/>\ncolor with her, but the &quot;colors&quot; end up being eaten, like yours :o) Some of<br/>\nthem are so much work, aren&#39;t they! I had no idea a toddler could be so<br/>\nexhausting, my first two weren&#39;t. Third time&#39;s the charm and all that.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Sometimes I find that after I post that I feel bad, because it seems like<br/>\nI&#39;m bashing my kids behind their backs to total strangers.  Yet I find that<br/>\nI need to talk, because I get so caught up in the experience that I can&#39;t<br/>\nthink straight.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is important to talk about it, and get help sorting it all out in your<br/>\nhead! I don&#39;t do it enough really, my family thinks I should spank to solve<br/>\nthe problems (that or send them to school) and that I should go to work.<br/>\nBeing a houseslob just isn&#39;t healthy you know lol. You shouldn&#39;t feel bad or<br/>\nguilty at all...do you think your kids will speak of you in positive terms<br/>\ntheir whole lives? ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I do want to say that I also have ALOT of fun with my kids. They are funny<br/>\nand interesting.  They are beautiful and full of life and energy.  Many<br/>\ntimes during the day, they do nice things for me and for each other.<br/>\nSometimes I am amazed at the things they do to help each other!  And they<br/>\nshow me so much about the world, sometimes things that I hadn&#39;t thought of<br/>\nbefore.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I feel overwhelmed by my kids, too, really you just said most of<br/>\nwhat I&#39;d say to describe them (funny, beautiful,...)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Sometime when I&#39;m not feeling so overwhelmed by parenthood, I&#39;ll post<br/>\nabout why I so enjoy being with them and wouldn&#39;t want it any other way!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, and save the post to read on a bad day :o)<br/>\nMarie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Hitting, Biting, etc...

I do get upset, and it<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; be explosive (loud and energetic), but I calm down quickly and relaxing<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t really a problem for me normally.  Problem is, my children have<br/>\nlately<br/>\n&gt; kept me from relaxing at all (unintentionally, of course.)  If I sit down<br/>\n&gt; with a cup of tea after playing with them or serving lunch and cleaning<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; kitchen, I can&#39;t even finish it without getting up several times to deal<br/>\n&gt; with something.

(longish)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Argh!!  My children are acting like beasts on a daily basis lately!<br/>\nStella, the 4 yo, screams bloody murder at Annie, the 3 yo (wonder where she<br/>\ngot that...sigh), but usually doesn&#39;t physically hurt anyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Annie, my almost 3.5 yo, has always been a bit brutish towards people for<br/>\nno apparent reason.  She is often very sweet and loving as well, but for<br/>\nsome reason, she will haul off and hit or kick Stella, the 4 yo, for no<br/>\napparent reason, or she&#39;ll poke her in the eyes, just because. (Sometimes<br/>\nthe reason is apparent--Stella has been annoying her in some way, but there<br/>\nare definitely many times when Annie just gets a wild a hair and hurts<br/>\nStella or the baby.)  She has been doing this alot lately for whatever<br/>\nreason--oh, I&#39;m sure there is one, but it&#39;s still not okay.  Just now, she<br/>\nslapped Stella hard in the face.  She did the same thing last night and<br/>\nyesterday afternoon.  Yesterday in the bathtub, she kicked her repeatedly in<br/>\nthe neck and head, while I was changing the baby&#39;s diaper.  This morning,<br/>\nafter removing her from the scene (they were all playing with blocks in the<br/>\nbedroom), and telling her that I will not allow her to hurt Stella, I asked<br/>\nher why she hit her.  She smiled and said, &quot;I just wanted to.&quot;  She was<br/>\nusing this &quot;little miss innocent, aren&#39;t I funny?&quot; voice that she uses for<br/>\njust this sort of occasion.  I don&#39;t like it at all.  I didn&#39;t let her go<br/>\nback in to play for a little while.  I told her that when she hurts the<br/>\nother kids, I have to protect them by removing her until I trust she can<br/>\nplay without hurting anyone. I was quite stern with her. When I did let her<br/>\ngo back in after about 2 minutes, she wasted no time jumping on Evan, the 13<br/>\nmo old, and wouldn&#39;t let him up!  ARGH!  I brought her back out, explaining<br/>\nagain, that it&#39;s not okay for her to hurt the other kids.  I again told her<br/>\nthat I am her mommy and also Stella and Evan&#39;s mommy, and I won&#39;t allow<br/>\nanyone to hurt any of them, including her.  She bellowed at the top of her<br/>\nlungs and strenuously resisted her removal and pitched a serious fit while<br/>\nin my company.  Finally she calmed down, and I hugged her and told her she<br/>\ncould play again, but would be removed if she hurt anyone.  Now I am<br/>\nwondering when it will happen again, because my experience tells me that it<br/>\nwill, and probably very soon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually, Annie is the most difficult to raise of all my children.  She is<br/>\nas cute as can be (actually looks like some renaissance painting of a<br/>\ncherub--she&#39;s chubby with rosy cheeks, big blue eyes and curly golden hair)<br/>\nand  she&#39;s very lovey, huggy, and also very imaginative.  She is very good<br/>\nat creating her own entertainment, even with just her fingers to animate.  I<br/>\nlove her dearly, of course. She is, however, VERY contrary and stubborn.<br/>\nShe does everything in her own way and time. She first crawled when she was<br/>\n13 months old.  She first walked at 18 mos.

(Sometimes the reason is apparent--Stella has been <br/>\nannoying her in some way, but there are definitely many times when <br/>\nAnnie just gets a wild a hair and hurts Stella or the baby.)  She has <br/>\nbeen doing this alot lately for whatever reason--oh, I&#39;m sure there <br/>\nis one, but it&#39;s still not okay.  Just now, she slapped Stella hard <br/>\nin the face.  She did the same thing last night and yesterday <br/>\nafternoon.  Yesterday in the bathtub, she kicked her repeatedly in <br/>\nthe neck and head, while I was changing the baby&#39;s diaper.  This <br/>\nmorning, after removing her from the scene (they were all playing <br/>\nwith blocks in the bedroom), and telling her that I will not allow <br/>\nher to hurt Stella, I asked her why she hit her.  She smiled and <br/>\nsaid, &quot;I just wanted to.&quot;  She was using this &quot;little miss innocent, <br/>\naren&#39;t I funny?&quot; voice that she uses for just this sort of occasion.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t like it at all.  I didn&#39;t let her go back in to play for a <br/>\nlittle while.  I told her that when she hurts the other kids, I have <br/>\nto protect them by removing her until I trust she can play without <br/>\nhurting anyone. I was quite stern with her. When I did let her go <br/>\nback in after about 2 minutes, she wasted no time jumping on Evan, <br/>\nthe 13 mo old, and wouldn&#39;t let him up!  ARGH!  I brought her back <br/>\nout, explaining again, that it&#39;s not okay for her to hurt the other <br/>\nkids.  I again told her that I am her mommy and also Stella and <br/>\nEvan&#39;s mommy, and I won&#39;t allow anyone to hurt any of them, including <br/>\nher.  She bellowed at the top of her lungs and strenuously resisted <br/>\nher removal and pitched a serious fit while in my company.  Finally <br/>\nshe calmed down, and I hugged her and told her she could play again, <br/>\nbut would be removed if she hurt anyone.  Now I am wondering when it <br/>\nwill happen again, because my experience tells me that it will, and <br/>\nprobably very soon.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Actually, Annie is the most difficult to raise of all my children.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>She is as cute as can be (actually looks like some renaissance <br/>\npainting of a cherub--she&#39;s chubby with rosy cheeks, big blue eyes <br/>\nand curly golden hair) and  she&#39;s very lovey, huggy, and also very <br/>\nimaginative.

My children are acting like beasts on a daily basis lately!  Stella, the 4 yo, screams bloody murder at Annie, the 3 yo (wonder where she got that...sigh), but usually doesn&#39;t physically hurt anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnie, my almost 3.5 yo, has always been a bit brutish towards people for no apparent reason.  She is often very sweet and loving as well, but for some reason, she will haul off and hit or kick Stella, the 4 yo, for no apparent reason, or she&#39;ll poke her in the eyes, just because. (Sometimes the reason is apparent--Stella has been annoying her in some way, but there are definitely many times when Annie just gets a wild a hair and hurts Stella or the baby.)  She has been doing this alot lately for whatever reason--oh, I&#39;m sure there is one, but it&#39;s still not okay.  Just now, she slapped Stella hard in the face.  She did the same thing last night and yesterday afternoon.  Yesterday in the bathtub, she kicked her repeatedly in the neck and head, while I was changing the baby&#39;s diaper.  This morning, after removing her from the scene (they were all playing with blocks in the bedroom), and telling her that I will not allow her to hurt Stella, I asked her why she hit her.  She smiled and said, &quot;I just wanted to.&quot;  She was using this &quot;little miss innocent, aren&#39;t I funny?&quot; voice that she uses for just this sort of occasion.  I don&#39;t like it at all.  I didn&#39;t let her go back in to play for a little while.  I told her that when she hurts the other kids, I have to protect them by removing her until I trust she can play without hurting anyone. I was quite stern with her. When I did let her go back in after about 2 minutes, she wasted no time jumping on Evan, the 13 mo old, and wouldn&#39;t let him up!  ARGH!  I brought her back out, explaining again, that it&#39;s not okay for her to hurt the other kids.  I again told her that I am her mommy and also Stella and Evan&#39;s mommy, and I won&#39;t allow anyone to hurt any of them, including her.  She bellowed at the top of her lungs and strenuously resisted her removal and pitched a serious fit while in my company.  Finally she calmed down, and I hugged her and told her she could play again, but would be removed if she hurt anyone.  Now I am wondering when it will happen again, because my experience tells me that it will, and probably very soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, Annie is the most difficult to raise of all my children.  She is as cute as can be (actually looks like some renaissance painting of a cherub--she&#39;s chubby with rosy cheeks, big blue eyes and curly golden hair) and  she&#39;s very lovey, huggy, and also very imaginative.  She is very good at creating her own entertainment, even with just her fingers to animate.  I love her dearly, of course. She is, however, VERY contrary and stubborn.  She does everything in her own way and time. She first crawled when she was 13 months old.  She first walked at 18 mos.  Didn&#39;t really trying talking in earnest until she was close to turning 3.  Not only did she not seem ready, but she seemed to prefer just yelling and making awful noises.  She is still deciding whether she wants to use the toilet or her pants, though, thankfully, she seems to be choosing the toilet more. (Always refused to use the little potty, even though she is very short compared to other kids her age.)  Before I had her, I thought I had a handle on most parenting issues.  HA!  She challenges almost everything at some point.  She is and always has been extremely difficult to redirect.  Used to be she wouldn&#39;t let you hold her when she was angry, but would freak out when you put her down.  (She&#39;s grown out of that for the most part, though, and welcomes my hugs when she is upset now.) She would fuss and kick me hard all night when I was still nursing her, digging her toes into my thighs when she was still sleeping with me, but would yell and yell if I tried to get her to sleep elsewhere.  She is unusually loud, too.  More than once, someone from several houses away has come to my door to see if &quot;everything was okay.&quot;  We laugh about it, especially now, but man, she was and is a trip!  She is the only child that has actually embarrased me enough that I left a store (a thrift store at that!) without getting what I went in for! I wouldn&#39;t let her play with a broken glass vase, and she went ballistic.  She started yelling so loudly it actually startled me and several other shoppers who looked over in amazement, and then she smacked me hard, right in the face, in front of them all.  The two older ladies shopping the same aisle were astonished.  I actually stayed quite calm,  I held her hands to keep her from doing it again (she was trying), told Stella I was sorry but because of the way Annie was behaving, we had to go, and I hightailed it straight out of there without purchasing anything I had in my cart.  Actually, I never had any trouble at all in stores or restaurants--just fun--until Annie.  I hate to say it, but if there is a cog in the wheel of our family plans, you can bet Annie put it there!  Anyway, she is an original, at least in our family.  I welcome any unschooling advice, for dealing with her, because I have found nothing that really consistently works.  And I don&#39;t know what to do about all this hitting and kicking of the other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, my one year old is starting to be very aggressive when he&#39;s frustrated.  He hits and he bites...hard.  He drew blood on me the other day.  I know some of it is because he is getting his one year molars, but he clearly bites when he is being thwarted in some way.  I usually deal with it by moving him away from me if he is biting me, and saying, &quot;biting hurts.&quot;  I do the same when he is biting the kids.  I will say that it is interesting that Annie is getting a bit of her own medicine, though she has never really been a biter (thank goodness!)  The other day, she actually had three visible bite marks on her.  And he is driven to pull her hair when she is watching a movie or is otherwise occupied.  It helps that I can show her that I won&#39;t let Evan keep biting her and pulling her hair, just like I won&#39;t let her hit and push him.  I think it is helping her to have something else to think about in relation to what she does.  Does that make sense?  Anyway, if there is something else I can do to help them all to learn to treat each other better, I welcome the ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading this long post.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Andrea<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96672,"nextTopicId":97151}}
