There&#39;s almost nothing new in <br/>\nour home, I shop at garage sales or out of the paper, and I accept things <br/>\npeople give me gladly.  I made up my mind a LONG time ago when we bought a brand <br/>\nnew couch and 2 days later my 1 year old (now 18) drew all over it with <br/>\ncrayon, that there will be a day when my house will be very clean, very neat, and <br/>\npossibly a little more stylish (though I don&#39;t really care), but that time is <br/>\nnot now while I&#39;ve got kids in the home.  This attitude has helped tremendously <br/>\nsince we started doing foster care.  I&#39;d rather do my best to have it clean, <br/>\nsomewhat organized, and comfortable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago I was good friends with a very conservative Mennonite family, and <br/>\never since then, I&#39;ve never cared much about &quot;things&quot; or appearances.  Their <br/>\nhome was so plain, their furniture was old, but it was comfortable and clean.  I <br/>\nadmire St. Francis a lot, too, and his simplicity, and wish I could live my <br/>\nlife more like he did.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone in our home purposely destroyed something that belonged to someone <br/>\nelse, we would expect them to replace it, or fix it, as best they <br/>\ncan,...that&#39;s just kindness and caring.  We talk about how it makes each other feel when <br/>\nwe don&#39;t take care of something that belongs to someone else.  I guess if <br/>\nsomeone punched a hole in a wall, I&#39;d have them patch it.  One of our kids tore <br/>\nthe side off a mattress, and I had them sew it back up with a needle and thread. <br/>\n I have a few keepsakes from my grandparents and parents that I keep put up.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t know how to do that with a wall though!

I&#39;m all for having the kids help me <br/>\nrepair the damage, and I understand and agree that there is nothing wrong <br/>\nwith *their* reasons for what they did.  However, as much as I want to <br/>\nbelieve that allowing them complete freedom to explore their wallpaper <br/>\npeeling is this great project we can all go on together, when exactly do <br/>\nthey understand respect for other people&#39;s property?  I mean afterall, I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like the wallpaper to begin with, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s say this were someone else&#39;s home we were visiting?  In my home, when <br/>\nthe kids draw on the walls I can grab the Mr. Clean eraser and we can clean <br/>\nit off together.  My family or friends probably won&#39;t feel like it&#39;s okay if <br/>\nmy kids do that in their homes.  This has actually happened before with a <br/>\nmarker at Grandma&#39;s house.  I&#39;m sorry but at some point there does come a <br/>\ntime when it&#39;s NOT ok for the kids to do whatever they wish in the name of <br/>\nartistic expression, instinct or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I hear answers like this I have to wonder if these are just ideals that <br/>\nsome people here hold or things you actually practice in your home???  At <br/>\nwhat point does it become important to you that you not have to choose <br/>\nbetween having your walls look like shit and dad getting mad or spending <br/>\nmoney to replace wallpaper or paint that you may or may not have on a <br/>\nrecurring basis?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the answers I&#39;ve read to this thread seem a bit lofty to me and <br/>\nfrankly, I have a hard time believing them, which is why I&#39;m asking thse <br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no problem having my kids help me replace the wallpaper or paint the <br/>\nwall, etc.  I do think there is something odd about just encouraging them to <br/>\ntear up the walls in the entire house just because I don&#39;t like the <br/>\nwallpaper and they think it&#39;s fun, interesting or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think that they started this whole mess because there were a few places <br/>\nwhere the wallpaper was bubbling away from the wall.  Chloe&#39;s only 19 months <br/>\nold!  Then the boys see what fun it is and there ya go.  But I also know <br/>\nthat given a very similar situation, there is a very strong likelyhood that <br/>\nthe kids will now do this somehwere else.  It&#39;s happened before with drawing <br/>\non walls and pulling books off shelves.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line is that regardless of how I feel about the wallpaper...and I <br/>\nDO hate it...we just bought this house two months ago and I want a house <br/>\nthat looks nice.  So does my husband, so do my older girls.  Is it really <br/>\nokay (for those of you who said as much) with you to continue to buy <br/>\nwallpaper?  Is it really okay with you if they tear things up in your house <br/>\nbecause they like to peel things?  I mean, what if we were talking about a <br/>\nchild popping holes in the wall with a hammer because he likes to and he has <br/>\nseen you hammering nails into the fence and decides he can try that out on <br/>\nyour living room wall...or your dinner plates, or your tv???<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really confused.<br/>\n<br/>\nJen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Need some gentle parenting help here!!!","postDate":"1085330111","msgId":94521,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Ny4yYTY2MDQ3ZC4yZGUyMmNiZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":94520,"nextInTopic":94522,"prevInTime":94520,"nextInTime":94522,"topicId":94466,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/23/04 10:16:28 AM, ecsamhill@earthlink.net writes:  The walls they are a-peeling.

I got the mag at Home Depot a week <br/>\nor two ago. You can get lots and lots of pegboard (i think thats what <br/>\nits called...like you&#39;d find tools hanging on in a garage), paint it <br/>\ncool funky colors, or whatever color goes with the room, and cover <br/>\nthe walls (or part of a wall)with it. They showed a kitchen, and had <br/>\nbaskets hanging on the pegboard to hold kitchen supplies, food like <br/>\nonions or potatoes, etc. The one in the bathroom had baskets hanging <br/>\nto hold towels and a mesh bag with bath toys. The coolest one was for <br/>\na family room, and they displayed kids&#39; artwork on it. All <br/>\nchangeable, very versatile and would hide an ugly wall. I can&#39;t wait <br/>\nto to this when i get my own place. And you can always take it down <br/>\nif you get sick of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust an idea!

I clean it periodically, and we will repaint before we move (renters). However I did ask her to restrict her painting to the one place - the bathroom - and not to paint on the unfinished wood, explaining why. So far she has been so happy to paint in one place, that she has not gone anywhere else. Also she loves to help me clean, scrubbing with a nail brush and rinsing with a wet cloth.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
