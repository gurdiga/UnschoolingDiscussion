Overall, he is much less unhappy and frustrated then he <br/>\nhad been.  But at the same time, he has a lot more twitches and <br/>\nrepetitive behaviours and he is much more fearful and in irrational <br/>\nway about some things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI told the therapist I feel like I&#39;m sitting in the middle of a dry <br/>\ngrassy field with a ring of little fires all around me.  As soon as I <br/>\nget one mostly out another pops up on the other side.  That&#39;s what <br/>\nit&#39;s like with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that part of the reason I can see more clearly that <br/>\nsomething is definitely not right with him is because we finally got <br/>\nhim stable enough for the symptoms to stay the same for more than a <br/>\nday at a time.  Before he was like Dr. Jeckyll, Mr. Hyde, Mr. Smith,  <br/>\nMr. Jones and several other people all rolled into one.  I never knew <br/>\nwhat to expect from one day to the next so I couldn&#39;t figureout what <br/>\nwas wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget - and as worried as I am about him, I wouldn&#39;t want to go back <br/>\ntwo years and have THAT kid back.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Wyndham","postDate":"1020188319","msgId":36574,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWMxZjA2ZCRlOGE0Y2FlMCQ0YzgwZWU0MEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMjAxMjEwNDUuMTU3MjIuOTI5NTQubTVAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":36577,"prevInTime":36573,"nextInTime":36575,"topicId":36574,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Sorry to hear this Bridget.
