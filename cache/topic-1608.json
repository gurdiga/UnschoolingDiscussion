Know that although the cat has the advantage of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; quickness and lack of concern for human life, you have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the advantage of strength.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalize on that advantage by selecting the battlefield.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Don&#39;t try to bathe him in an open area where he can force<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you to chase him.  Pick a very small bathroom.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If your bathroom is more than four feet square, I recommend<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that you get in the tub with the cat and close the sliding<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; -glass doors as if you were about to take a shower.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (A simple shower curtain will not do.  A berserk<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; cat can shred a three-ply rubber shower curtain quicker than<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a politician can shift positions.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; B.  Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; remove all the skin from your body.  Your advantage here<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; is that you are smart and know how to dress to protect<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; yourself.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I recommend canvas overalls tucked into high-top<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; construction boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves, an army<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; helmet, a hockey face-mask, and a long-sleeved flak jacket.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; C.  Use the element of surprise.  Pick up your cat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; nonchalantly, as if to simply carry him to his supper dish.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (Cats will not usually notice your strange attire.  They have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; little or no interest in fashion as a rule.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; D.  Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; survival.  In a single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; step into the tub enclosure, slide the glass door shut, dip<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the cat in the water and squirt him with shampoo.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; You have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; E.  Cats have no handles.  Add the fact that he now has<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; soapy fur, and the problem is radically compounded.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Do not expect to hold on to him for more than two or three<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; seconds at a time.  When you have him, however, you must<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; remember to give him another squirt of shampoo and rub<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; like crazy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; He&#39;ll then spring free and fall back into the water, thereby<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; rinsing himself off. (The national record for cats is three<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; latherings, so don&#39;t expect too much.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; F.  Next, the cat must be dried.  Novice cat bathers always<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; assume this part will be the most difficult, for humans<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; generally are worn out at this point and the cat is just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; getting really determined.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, the drying is simple compared with what you have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; just been through.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s because by now the cat is semi-permanently affixed to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; your right leg.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; You simply pop the drain plug with your foot, reach for your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; towel and wait.  (Occasionally, however, the cat will end up<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; clinging to the top of your army helmet.  If this happens,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the best thing you can do is to shake him loose and to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; encourage him toward your leg.)  After all the water is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; drained from the tub, it is a simple matter to just reach<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; down and dry the cat.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; your leg.  He will usually have nothing to say for about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; three weeks and will spend a lot of time sitting with his<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; back to you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; He might even become psychoceramic and develop the fixed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; stare of a plaster figurine.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; You will be tempted to assume he is angry.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; This isn&#39;t usually the case.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; As a rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; defenses and injure you for life the next time you decide<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to give him a bath.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; But at least now he smells a lot better.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tanya in WA (state)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---SENT FROM A FREE INTERNET AND EMAIL ACCOUNT FROM WWW.FREEi.NET!---<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The planet&#39;s eCenter for health & well-being.
