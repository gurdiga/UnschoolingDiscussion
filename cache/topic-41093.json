My 6-yo daughter came over to see what I was doing and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;just plucked out the pieces and put it together in maybe 5 seconds.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds like she&#39;s a big-picture thinker. She can evision the end result in <br/>\nher head and doesn&#39;t always need all the steps to get there. That&#39;s very <br/>\ncool. My husband thinks like that too. He&#39;s a programmer and just &quot;knows&quot; <br/>\nwhere the bugs are when someone is talking design with him. Trouble is, he <br/>\nsometimes has a hard time explaining to the others just how he knows without <br/>\na lot of testing. He says he just sees the program run through to its end in <br/>\nhis head and can visualize where the problems are.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;The 6-yo (almost 7) doesn&#39;t want anything to do with reading, games (she <br/>\n&gt;&gt;hates the competition/winning aspect), or being judged or evaluated in any <br/>\n&gt;&gt;way.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a good thing. :o) Luckily she&#39;s home and doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>\nevaluated on a regular basis. As far as the reading goes, six (even almost <br/>\n7) is still young. I would let her take her time and come to reading at her <br/>\nown pace. You, of course, can stil surround her with all the joyous <br/>\nexcitement that the printed word can bring. This means lots of access to <br/>\nbooks, magazines, lists, notes, posters, cards, crafts, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;She&#39;s very short-tempered, high strung, and uncooperative.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow! You could be describing my daughter, Casey. Except I would use the <br/>\nterms intense, focused, and independent. :o) After all, if you&#39;re always <br/>\nthinking, and have great ideas of your own, it&#39;s got to be awfully hard to <br/>\njust do it someone else&#39;s way and at their tedious pace. And when they won&#39;t <br/>\nlisten just cause you&#39;re *only* six, how frustrating!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Teachers in classes she&#39;s taken have told me that she gets her feelings <br/>\n&gt;&gt;hurt a lot and will storm off if she &quot;messes up&quot; in some way.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aahhh.....another perfectionist. :o) I know it well and lived it a bit, <br/>\nalthough not as intensely as Casey. I think it&#39;s hard to have a perfect, <br/>\nfabulous, grown-up vision in your head and then only 6 year old hands to <br/>\ncomplete it. It&#39;s frustrating. Lots of love and patience have helped Casey <br/>\nto mature with this particular trait.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;She&#39;s very curious, has lots of interests, very verbal, and can articulate <br/>\n&gt;&gt;very clearly her emotions.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Great! Keep her talking and keep her mind busy! Casey thrives with lots of <br/>\ndifferent projects to work on. She NEEDS to have have her mind fed at all <br/>\ntimes. It&#39;s exhausting, but so worth it and so necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend reading the book Raising Your Spirited Child by Mary <br/>\nSheedy Kurcinka. It was a life altering book for me in understanding my <br/>\nfabulous, intense girl.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;We&#39;ve been unschooling for a few years now, and I purposely try not to put <br/>\n&gt;&gt;on any pressure to be perfect or to not make mistakes.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure she&#39;s still putting pressure on herself. It may be in her nature, <br/>\nlike it is with Casey. I like to let Casey see me making mistakes. I talk <br/>\nthrough them, even show my frustration with myself. I try to model coping <br/>\ntechniques for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;We mainly read together and do interesting things/go to interesting places <br/>\n&gt;&gt;as a family.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds great. Casey also likes LOTS of crafts and writing and drawing. She <br/>\nlikes to create. Maybe your daughter might need a similar outlet. An outlet <br/>\nfor Casey&#39;s seemingly limitless physical energy has also been invaluable. <br/>\nFor Casey it&#39;s been gymnastics and swimming, but a trip to the park also <br/>\nimproves her mood when she&#39;s frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Thanks for any insights, Kacy&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hey, you&#39;re a Casey/Kacy too! :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":6658645,"authorName":"goldsbydk@aol.com","from":"goldsbydk@...","profile":"goldsbydk","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Understanding a kid who thinks differently than I do","postDate":"1029359217","msgId":41093,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRhLmZmNmM0YjUuMmE4YzIwNzFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":41517,"prevInTime":41092,"nextInTime":41094,"topicId":41093,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I had a sudden discovery last night that my child thinks differently than I do (duh) and I d like some help in understanding her.
