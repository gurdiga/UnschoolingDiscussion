I wanted to be <br/>\nhome with my son, and the more I researched homeschooling, and unschooling in <br/>\nparticular, the more difficult it was to go to work each day.<br/>\n  I worked for Head Start for 15 years.  The official name is Full Year Head <br/>\nStart.  It was designed to give low income and handicapped children a boost, <br/>\nso they would be able to compete (for lack of a better word) favorably with <br/>\nthe other kindergardeners.  It served the children who were 4 or 5 years old, <br/>\nand attending K the next year.  A few years ago we began taking three year <br/>\nolds.  Then, the year before I quit, they started a new program called Early <br/>\nHead Start.  The clients?  PREGNANT WOMEN!  So these kids would be in the <br/>\nprogram before they were even born right up to kindergarden age.  Give me a <br/>\nbreak.  I think these moms will be so dependent on outside &quot;expertise&quot; <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be reluctant to trust their own judgment regarding their kids.<br/>\nMary J<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38855,"nextTopicId":38862}}
