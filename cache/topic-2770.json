Between this and the new<br/>\n&#39;schedule&#39; thing she is going through I do feel she is comparing her 4<br/>\nyears of ps to the hsing experience she is having.  She is really into<br/>\ngetting her work &#39;done&#39; and I suspect that is also a throw back from<br/>\nschool.  Unfortunately the 6 yog is also attempting this same scenario -<br/>\ntrying to be like big sister I suppose as she has never been to ps.  Becky,<br/>\ndid we figure out where each other live?  Any chance of meeting at a park<br/>\nor something?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess this brings me to the point of asking if there are other<br/>\nunschoolers out there that had kids in ps?  I&#39;m the only one in my support<br/>\ngroup out here and there is not a lot they seem to be able to tell me in<br/>\novercoming these challenges.  I want to get rid of the I want to get &#39;done&#39;<br/>\nsyndrome as well as that rotten schedule - uck!  She is a great kid but<br/>\ndoes want to be told what to learn and how to learn it.  She has only been<br/>\nout of ps 1 year so perhaps I&#39;m expecting a bit too much just yet.
