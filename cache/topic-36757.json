She<br/>\nwas talking to a wealthy, well educated man at her church that was visiting<br/>\nfrom America. He had given a sermon on the importance of bettering one&#39;s lot<br/>\nin life by making the best use of whatever resources you currently have<br/>\navailable.... He told her that she should learn about those ants and her <br/>\nstoop then...She eventually went on to write books about the things she had <br/>\nlearned and making quite a bit of money.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may have the details not quite right, but the jist is that learning about<br/>\none thing kept leading to learning about something else. And a woman who<br/>\nthought that she couldn&#39;t learn anything or make anything better out of her<br/>\nlife was able to do so. And she did it on her own. Kind of like unschooling,<br/>\ndon&#39;t you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzanna<br/>\n<br/>\nSUZANNA,<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for posting this story.  It has been very insightful for me.  I <br/>\nsometimes get anxious that we aren&#39;t doing enough - and that probably won&#39;t <br/>\nchange...:-), but your story has helped quell my most recent worries.  <br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nFreedompanther<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36748,"nextTopicId":36768}}
