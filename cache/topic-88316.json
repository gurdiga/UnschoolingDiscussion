Dh is a <br/>\nhistorian/college prof.  I love reading, writing, playing the piano, <br/>\nknitting socks, and sometimes gardening.  We moved to Oregon from <br/>\nIowa a year and a half ago.  I miss old friends who I could really <br/>\nlaugh with. Here I seem to meet people who are really busy or really <br/>\nserious.<br/>\nMy new year sruggles: <br/>\nMany years ago, I homeschooled ds for two years, and felt like I was <br/>\nnot &quot;homeschool mother material,&quot; since I had a terrible time making <br/>\nmyself say &quot;No, you have to do your math,&quot; when he wanted to play <br/>\noutside instead.  So, we went the school route for the next 5 years.  <br/>\nEvery September, I felt soooo blue.  The last spring my kids were in <br/>\nschool, I was becoming so frustrated about the amount of school-<br/>\ninduced stress in their lives, and I took to the internet to read <br/>\nagain about homeschooling.  For the first time, I read about <br/>\nunschooling.  It was such a relief.  I can do that!<br/>\nBUT--after two years of unschooling, I felt I wasn&#39;t so good at that <br/>\neither!  Ds felt he was wasting too much time and that he needed to <br/>\nbe told what to do.  Dd10 was afraid she wasn&#39;t learning as much as <br/>\nher schooled peers.  (Dd12 loved it and learned tons.)  But in light <br/>\nof the others, DH encouraged me to try more of a mixed approach: some <br/>\nsubjects with books and assignments, the rest self-directed. So this <br/>\npast fall, that&#39;s what we did.  But as the new year begins, I find <br/>\nmyself so reluctant to get out those books again.  It&#39;s not like they <br/>\nwill be met with any enthusiasm!  You know, with my dd10, I feel like <br/>\nshe&#39;s saying, &quot;I&#39;m hungry, but I don&#39;t want to fix myself anything to <br/>\neat, but I don&#39;t like what you serve either.&quot;  Arg!  I feel like I&#39;m <br/>\na boring cook!  I want to serve up some gourmet fare, but I&#39;m low on <br/>\nideas.  Well, really, I must admit, I don&#39;t want to have to come up <br/>\nwith the ideas!<br/>\nAfter writing this out, I think I will just leave those books on the <br/>\nshelf, and try to serve a few &quot;hors&#39;d&#39;oevres.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLynn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89136,"nextTopicId":89146}}
