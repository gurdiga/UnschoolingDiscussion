Each letter has <br/>\none and only one possible sound, one letter for each sound present in <br/>\nspoken Turkish, and there are none of those pesky digraphs and weird <br/>\nstuff like silent letters. Why can&#39;t English be like that??

It was <br/>\none of Ataturk&#39;s lasting achievements, to bring mass literacy to a <br/>\nland that had previously been largely illiterate. Even today, Turkish <br/>\nchildren spend far less time learning how to read than American kids <br/>\ndo. I guarantee you that if written English made as much sense as <br/>\nwritten Turkish does, that more kids would learn to read faster and <br/>\nsooner, and that levels of dyslexia and other related &quot;reading <br/>\ndisabilities&quot; amongst children would drop dramatically.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut of course, barring a fullblown revolution like what happened in <br/>\nTurkey in the 1920s, I suppose nobody is going to be changing our <br/>\nsystem anytime soon, so we just have to deal with it.
