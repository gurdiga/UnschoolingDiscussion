Are reg. peanuts when roasted in the <br/>\nshell ok?  I&#39;m starting to wonder if anything is safe to eat or drink.    I <br/>\nhave given up chocolate a year ago, soft drinks (since March), all caffeine, <br/>\nsugar, white bread, grapes, bacon, frozen dinners, processed meats and <br/>\ncheeses, chips;and while I am learning how to stabilize my blood sugar, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t eat potatoes or corn or white rice, either.  I have to eat about every <br/>\n2 hrs, but it seems as if the options are narrowing.  In my hypoglycemic <br/>\nbooks, there are lists of specific fruits I cannot have due to the high <br/>\nfructose levels, and specific vegetables to be very leery of due to the high <br/>\nglycemic /starch levels.  So, I feel like I keep giving foods up, only to <br/>\nfind the ones that seem ok, are still bad., like strawberries.  I want to eat <br/>\nhealthy, most of all, but I don&#39;t know what actually is safe now.  Does <br/>\nanyone feel this way?  Well, it&#39;s time for a snack... I think I&#39;ll have some <br/>\ncheddar cheese.  According to the Hypo-G book, it&#39;s a good choice.  I am <br/>\nnursing a baby, and have got to eat foods that will give some &quot;sustenance&quot;, <br/>\nso I hope I won&#39;t learn now that this is terrible, too.  :)  ~Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8808,"nextTopicId":8838}}
