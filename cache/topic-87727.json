(And now that I think about <br/>\nit I&#39;m whining about nothing much at all.)  Here was the situation yesterday <br/>\nmid-day:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe rented Seabiscuit and it&#39;s due Sunday and I haven&#39;t watched it.<br/>\nI wanted Kirby to move the XBox back into his room so I could sit and play <br/>\nneopets pattern games without any words and watch a movie too.  He said he would.<br/>\nKirby and Marty wanted to take my van to a party in another town at 5:00 and <br/>\nI said they could.<br/>\nHolly wanted to go and buy a battery operated toy violin from the music store <br/>\nand I said I would take her.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and I left at 3:45 and had so much fun we forgot about the 5:00 need.  <br/>\nWe got back and 5:45, and as we were entering the house I said &quot;The boys are <br/>\ngone already...&quot; and then realized *I HAD THE VAN.*<br/>\n<br/>\nSo out come grumpy Kirby and Marty, OVERready to go, and I said &quot;I am SO <br/>\nsorry,&quot; and they accepted it somewhat grudgingly, and said &quot;We have to pick up <br/>\nJoey and Sam.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I was inconveniencing four people and holding up a party.   Very bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I went into Kirby&#39;s room and the x-box hadn&#39;t been moved.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey wait, that&#39;s a story about how irresponsible *I* was, not Kirby.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t rub your kids up against me this week.<br/>\n<br/>\nI called the party hostess and apologized that that batch of guys would be <br/>\nlate, and asked her to have Kirby call me and talk me through moving that, but <br/>\nKeith moved it for me and figured it all out, so when Kirby called, Keith just <br/>\nlightly poked him about forgetting.  He said something like &quot;You lost the <br/>\nmoral high ground a bit by not moving that x-box.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, if that&#39;s the worst thing that happens to us this month we&#39;re doing <br/>\npretty well!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":91123469,"authorName":"The Bucknum&#39;s","from":"The Bucknum&#39;s &lt;ctbucknum@...&gt;","profile":"hsmamaca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Pod people ...","postDate":"1073181157","msgId":87730,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWMzZDI2NSQ2ZWMyOGVjMCQ3ZmJjNDMxOEBPdXJzSFA+","referencesHeader":"PDAwMGIwMWMzZDE4OCRiYWQ4NDk0MCQxMGVjZmVhOUBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":87727,"nextInTopic":87759,"prevInTime":87729,"nextInTime":87731,"topicId":87727,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Can I borrow your pod person and rub him up against","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-389235034\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;neglecting AND even wiped the stove down.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I keep the pod person??  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am impressed!<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbara&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I borrow your pod person and rub him up against my children to see if it&#39;s contagious?<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa in Canada<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":76425644,"authorName":"Barbara Moreda","from":"&quot;Barbara Moreda&quot; &lt;homeiscool@...&gt;","profile":"lllbarbara","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Pod people ...","postDate":"1073111679","msgId":87759,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2EwMWMzZDFjMyRhYWFkMDcwMCQxMGVjZmVhOUBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMGIwMWMzZDE4OCRiYWQ4NDk0MCQxMGVjZmVhOUBhb2xkc2wubmV0PiA8MDAwYTAxYzNkMjY1JDZlYzI4ZWMwJDdmYmM0MzE4QE91cnNIUD4="},"prevInTopic":87730,"nextInTopic":87809,"prevInTime":87758,"nextInTime":87760,"topicId":87727,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... it s contagious? ...
