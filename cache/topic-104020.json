Dagny had such a great time.  In the<br/>\ncar on the ride home she talked and talked and talked.  She told me one<br/>\nnight they were all laying around in the dark playing guitar and singing<br/>\nBeatles&#39; songs, and it just sounded like one of those times that you<br/>\nremember forever. She was happily amazed to have been a visitor in two homes<br/>\nwhere she *felt* at home.  I love that the kids are traveling to hang out<br/>\nwith each other. We&#39;d love to have some unschooling visitors any time :0).<br/>\n<br/>\nHer life is so different than mine was at her age.  I wouldn&#39;t ever have<br/>\nconsidered asking my parents if I could go to a sleepover at a boy&#39;s house<br/>\nwith a bunch of older kids - I would have tried to find a way to do it<br/>\nwithout them knowing instead.  She is so much more grounded and mature and<br/>\nsecure in herself at 12 than I was at 20.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile she was there she watched Spinal Tap and really liked it.  I had never<br/>\nseen it and she thought I&#39;d enjoy it, so she put it on our Netflix queue,<br/>\nand we all watched it together today.  We laughed a lot and had some cool<br/>\nconversations about how rock developed and how adults reacted to the<br/>\nsexuality of it. We talked about Elvis and Jim Morrison, and Jon brought up<br/>\nthe Ed Sullivan Show.  There&#39;s a lot to talk about in that movie - long<br/>\nhair/fashion, spontaneous combustion, documentaries, Yoko Ono, aging<br/>\nrockers, funny English words (wonker), chapeaus and haberdashers, amps that<br/>\ngo to 11 &lt;G&gt;.  When I lived with my parents I wasn&#39;t allowed to see PG<br/>\nmovies, so I would never have told my mom I watched an R rated one, let<br/>\nalone recommended it to her.  I feel so lucky that Rowan and Dagny and Jon<br/>\nand I really *know* each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nDagny asked me today if Spinal Tap was rated R just because they said f____.<br/>\nIt reminded me of something that happened when she was about 4.  She asked<br/>\nme what the movie ratings meant.  After we talked about R she said, &quot;What<br/>\ncomes next?&quot; I said X, and that one big difference was they could show a<br/>\npenis.  She said, &quot;Ya, well, there&#39;s nothing worse than a naked penis&quot; with<br/>\na totally straight face and then cracked up.

Dagny also joined them, along with Bryanna.  Julian <br/>\nwas thrilled.<br/>\n <br/>\nAt the time I was also experiencing some pain, which I discovered was  my <br/>\ngall bladder. Soon after the kids left I went in for surgery, but first there  <br/>\nwas another adventure. Remember that snow storm I mentioned? Well, as Beth was  <br/>\ndigging out and warming up the car to take me to the hospital, a huge, 9&quot;  <br/>\ndiameter icicle fell onto the roof of the car, crushing the roof and smashing  <br/>\nthe windshield.
