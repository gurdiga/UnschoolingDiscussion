He worked and saved to go to<br/>\ncollege, but had to quit because of WW2 and family problems. My dad went<br/>\nto college, but didn&#39;t finish (until he was in his 40&#39;s). <br/>\n <br/>\nI was the first one to &quot;have all the opportunities,&quot; and I did... my<br/>\nparents paid for my 4-year degree, and I was the first on either side of<br/>\nmy family to graduate with a college degree, fulfilling the American<br/>\ndream for our family.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy dad loves what he sees in my girls, and we&#39;ve had great talks about<br/>\nunschooling. It&#39;s neat to see him accept that the next step in the<br/>\nevolution of our family is the ability for my girls to choose *not* to<br/>\njust go to college as an obvious next step of success... but that being<br/>\nable to have them pursue their dreams might mean that they *don&#39;t* go to<br/>\ncollege.

I have no fear of this occurring myself! <br/>\n <br/>\n****<br/>\n <br/>\nI feel this vibe from people all the time.  Sometimes people -- often eclectic or school-at-homers -- say things like, &#39;I can&#39;t wait until her kids are high school age.&#39;  I heard that statement just last week from someone about an unschooling Mom I know whose kids are already high school age.  It came up when she heard where I live and asked who I know (by name).  I answered that her kids are already high school age, and it hasn&#39;t yet changed her positions on anything, at least not that I&#39;ve seen.  It was odd to watch her faical expression go from one of superiority to (I&#39;m not really sure how to describe it) confusion? surprise?
