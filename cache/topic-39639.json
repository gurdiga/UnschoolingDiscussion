He got to where he could read it when <br/>\nwe wrote it down.  Once a friend of ours was carrying him around a car <br/>\ndealership.  Will was very little, less than 2.  Our friend pointed out <br/>\na huge letter painted on the window and said &quot;what&#39;s that?&quot; and Will <br/>\nsaid, &quot;H&quot; and it was.

I&#39;d find <br/>\na number of ways to approach it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGames for Reading by Peggy Kaye. LOTS of great ideas in there. Have fun, play <br/>\ngames, he&#39;ll be learning to read - if he is ready he&#39;ll soak it up and it&#39;ll <br/>\nhappen. If he isn&#39;t ready (and it isn&#39;t terribly uncommon for younger <br/>\nbrothers to want to read like older sisters and yet not be developmentally <br/>\nready), you&#39;ll need to find ways to let him feel good about being on the road <br/>\nto reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk what words he wants to read - write them on an index card, let him draw a <br/>\npicture on the other side, if he wants to. Keep &quot;HIS SPECIAL WORDS&quot; in an <br/>\nenvelope somewhere where he can take them out and read anytime he wants. He <br/>\ncan write sentences or phrases, too, but often kids are happy with just <br/>\nspecial words. My daughters all did this and loved to take out their words <br/>\nand would &quot;read&quot; them aloud to anybody who would listen - over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can write action words on cards -- &quot;JUMP&quot; and &quot;STOP&quot; and &quot;RUN&quot; and &quot;HOP&quot; <br/>\nand so on --- then you flash the card and he does the action -- use only a <br/>\nset of words that all start with a different letter, at first. Or write them <br/>\nin different colors. This is a fun &quot;reading game&quot; -- that might be satisfying <br/>\nto him.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatty Wolcott&#39;s books are GREAT for kids to really read big words fairly <br/>\nquickly. They are not controlled-vocabulary books - and they are fun to read, <br/>\nhave a bit of rhythm/sound to them that makes them pleasant to read over and <br/>\nover. And that&#39;s what you do with them - read them over and over -- there is <br/>\nso much repetition that the kids memorize lots of the pages and begin to <br/>\nrecognize the words -- even big words like &quot;marvelous.&quot; They start to look at <br/>\nthe words carefully to see what the differences are between them - so that <br/>\nthey can distinguish them. They usually first recognize them by the first <br/>\nletter sound and then the context -- pictures and repeated sentences. The <br/>\nMarvelous Mudwashing Machine and The Cake Story were our favorites. They&#39;re <br/>\nout of print -- but available used and in libraries. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bob Books and other little sets of controlled vocabulary books are good <br/>\nif your child enjoys them - not as a reading program - just to have a play <br/>\nwith. Somebody gave us the first set and my youngest  daughter carried them <br/>\naround in a little lunch pail for months - with a set of colored pencils -- <br/>\nshe used them as coloring books (they are simple black and white line <br/>\ndrawings). I read them to her, she memorized them and read them to herself. <br/>\nShe was happy with that. She wasn&#39;t REALLY reading -- she didn&#39;t recognize <br/>\nthe words in the Bob books in other contexts for a couple of years after <br/>\nthat. But it set the stage and she was satisfied. Trying to give her direct <br/>\nphonics instruction was a wasted and frustrating effort - even as casually <br/>\nand informally as I did it. She did not retain even the most simple <br/>\nletter-sound connections - until she&#39;d accumulated a LOT of sight words in <br/>\nher reading vocabulary and began to sort out the phonics patterns herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7047022,"authorName":"Gina Loree Marks","from":"Gina Loree Marks &lt;ginaloree@...&gt;","profile":"ginaloree","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] RE: Phun with Phonics","postDate":"1028478280","msgId":39735,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwODA0MTYyNDQwLjIxODkzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzMjA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJORUFJS0ZJTUlMREZIQ0JQUE1NS0VMSURFQUEua2JtYXRsb2NrQGF0dGJpLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":39727,"nextInTopic":39737,"prevInTime":39734,"nextInTime":39736,"topicId":39639,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey, does anyone remember the grocery store, Grand Onion ?

Armed with confidence and aided by <br/>\n&gt;exuberant, colorful illustrations, children will delight in <br/>\n&gt;discovering that they are actually reading. The opening two sections <br/>\n&gt;are about the process. The last section gives 19 selections to read <br/>\n&gt;such as poems, knock-knock jokes, an alphabet of names, and a <br/>\n&gt;double-page spread of a school scene with labels, dialogue balloons, <br/>\n&gt;and a chalkboard message.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From the Publisher<br/>\n&gt;Best-selling children&#39;s author Betty Miles reveals the secrets <br/>\n&gt;behind one of life&#39;s most important and enjoyable skills in the <br/>\n&gt;first-ever &quot;how to&quot; book for children who are just getting ready to <br/>\n&gt;read-and for the parents, relatives, teachers, and friends who want <br/>\n&gt;to help them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  From the Critics<br/>\n&gt;From School Library Journal  <br/>\n&gt;Sylvie Wickstrom&#39;s pictures are delightful.

Sensible and unpretentious, it should be a real help in <br/>\n&gt;demystifying reading. -- Quill & Quire<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sheila, I think it is fabulous. As the last paragraph suggests, it is <br/>\nnot a how-to book, but a book about boosting reading confidence for <br/>\nboth child and parent. Evan actually loved the book because it is <br/>\nabout what he already knows and not about what he is lacking in <br/>\nknowledge; for example:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;When you talk, you say words. When you read, you read words [...] <br/>\n&gt;You already know most of the words you&#39;re going to read.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the first part. The second part talks about the SIX WAYS (Ned, <br/>\nare you counting) we learn to read and one of them is (Yes, Ned) by <br/>\n&#39;sounding out words&#39;. The third part has poems, jokes and mini <br/>\nstories like &#39;The Mad Story&#39; (You did it! I did not!).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out the book with him and see where it takes you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLiza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Phun with Phonics","postDate":"1028423770","msgId":39706,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFpaHY4cSt1YnVzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNENEM1RjY1LkE4NzM1MDRGQGNveC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":39703,"nextInTopic":39710,"prevInTime":39705,"nextInTime":39707,"topicId":39639,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... to ...

Also, I&#39;m not talking about particular children<br/>\nor your children who have learned things seemingly by magic,  but the vast<br/>\nnumbers of &quot;average&quot; kids who want to learn to read and are ready and need<br/>\nto be shown HOW....right NOW, or sometime.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though some kids seem to pick it up by osmosis, they are learning<br/>\nskills. It is not magic. The skills (collectively) are called Phonics. I<br/>\nagree that it does not always require teaching, and certainly not<br/>\nfactory-style rote repetitions. But when teaching is requested, it needs to<br/>\nbe right; it needs to be useful; it needs to provide skills, and today it<br/>\nneeds to be fast and easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt needs to be phonics...the nuts and bolts of reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnglish is a phonetic language. It was designed (imperfectly due to<br/>\ncomplications in England with other languages in use there) as a compromise<br/>\nbetween Latin and northern European tongues, and several forces have<br/>\ninfluenced the evolution of modern American English. That doesn&#39;t change the<br/>\nbasic  simple fact...the letters stand for spoken sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea (the discovery) behind English is phonetics. In order to read, we<br/>\nMUST be able to turn printed letters into sounds -- whether they are spoken<br/>\nor silently &quot;read&quot; to ourselves. Until a child can do that, reading is not<br/>\nhappening.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo repeat: If we can read this, we are using phonics to do it (not something<br/>\nelse).<br/>\n<br/>\nPhonics and Phonetics:<br/>\nPhonics is a method of learning to read by learning the phonetic value<br/>\n(sounds) of letters and groups of letters. Phonetics is the study of speech<br/>\nsounds -- the sounds of languages. For my purpose here, those are virtually<br/>\ninterchangable -- with distinctions, but not differences.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are other concepts about learning to read, fine, but they do not<br/>\ntell us HOW to read. The ability to read, unlike the abilities of walking<br/>\nand talking, requires specific knowledge. It&#39;s not esoteric, or difficult,<br/>\nbut it is specific.  Unlike walking and talking our native tongue, reading<br/>\nis not &quot;natural,&quot; it is a sophisticated skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the &quot;motivation&quot; in the world does not teach us to read. We can be<br/>\nsurrounded by books and such, but that doesn&#39;t give us the skill that&#39;s<br/>\nneeded. All such &quot;immersion&quot; is mere therapy. Many are not &quot;getting&quot; it<br/>\ntoday, and those kids end up in a growing disaster -- special ed. It&#39;s not<br/>\ninstruction in skills. We don&#39;t usually throw children into deep pools to<br/>\n&quot;teach&quot; them to swim. Hey, it has worked, but there&#39;s a down side for too<br/>\nmany.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra sends this:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;VA HUSPEDEL WILL CALL DAD TO REE SKEGUEL MRI&lt;&lt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(translation: VA hospital will call Dad to re-schedule MRI)<br/>\nLittle Holly, who took that telephone message, knows that in order to write,<br/>\nshe needs to use letters to represents sounds. She did a great job. She<br/>\nproved that she knew the principles of phonics. She can learn to spell some<br/>\nother time, if she wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is this: Holly would not have been able to write the message if she<br/>\nhad not had the skill and knowledge she had. I am not suggesting that<br/>\nparents sit down and torture their kids with rote learning or even gentle<br/>\npersuasion. I am also not suggesting that people not surround their kids<br/>\nwith motivations to read and write. (Literacy is vital to survival in our<br/>\nsociety)  I am simply stating the facts of how the English language works.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the &quot;exceptions&quot; that are cited seem to be used in trying to prove that<br/>\nphonics is not a fact, but they are still merely exceptions to the rules.<br/>\nThe vast majority of English words follow the simple patterns of its<br/>\norigins.  Who doesn&#39;t know that there are exceptions?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not talking about &quot;why&quot; a child reads or should learn to read. It<br/>\nreally doesn&#39;t matter why. What matters is HOW to do it. The HOW is<br/>\nphonics...Letters stand for sounds...make the simple connection between<br/>\nletters and sounds and Bingo, I can read. If I don&#39;t make that connection, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t.  Can anyone tell us another way?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo. So why is there any argument?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason why I&#39;m writing this is so that when children ask about learning<br/>\nhow to read, parents and others will know how to help them. Sure, read to<br/>\nthem for motivation, show them the necessity of reading in order to learn<br/>\nabout the world, let them know the joys and satisfactions that come from<br/>\nreading, etc. But when they want to know HOW, they need the specific skill<br/>\nthat comes from knowing that letters stand for sounds. They need to know the<br/>\nletters and their related sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat separates a kid who can read from one who can&#39;t read. One knows the<br/>\nconnection between letters and sounds; the other doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey need to know. It doesn&#39;t mean that they need to be taught. Many kids,<br/>\nincluding mine, learned it on their own. BUT THEY DID LEARN IT, because<br/>\nwithout it, they can&#39;t read. Sounding out (decoding the print) is a first<br/>\nstep, and soon children get so good at it that they don&#39;t notice that<br/>\nthey&#39;re doing it. They have advanced their skills into fluency and<br/>\nunderstanding. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not talking about &quot;interpreting&quot; or, as WL enthusiasts say,<br/>\n&quot;constructing meaning.&quot; I am talking about finding out, as exactly as<br/>\npossible, what the author is saying -- accurate transmission of particular<br/>\nwords -- that&#39;s the purpose of written language. Interpreting is needed when<br/>\ntrying to understand pictographic languages (such as Chinese) in which<br/>\npictures (characters) stand for ideas, not specific words. Try drawing a<br/>\npicture of Truth, or Freedom, or polite or desperate...and you&#39;ll see that<br/>\nwords work better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;m not talking about &quot;understanding&quot; what is read. That depends on<br/>\nthe experience of the reader. Understanding is a level beyond simple<br/>\nreading, but reading comes first. We cannot &quot;understand&quot; what we can&#39;t<br/>\ndecipher (read). <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone asked if I have ever been a school teacher. Yes. Two years in<br/>\nelementary grades; one year high school -- all grades, most subjects,<br/>\nprivate schools; one year college -- continuing ed (adults). My professional<br/>\ntraining (and part-time career) was/is in architecture, and I have had many<br/>\noccupations.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who might be interested in the origins of writing, and therefore<br/>\nreading, I would advise going to any good encyclopedia. There you will find,<br/>\nas I have, that phonics is not just a fad or a fancy that modern &quot;theories&quot;<br/>\nof schooling can discard as &quot;out of fashion&quot; or &quot;no longer useful&quot; in a<br/>\nworld of therapy and excuses. Phonics is the basis of the English language.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who want some facts about the world of Whole Language and its<br/>\nequally evil twin, Outcome Based Education (OBE), I suggest the book, &quot;The<br/>\nOBE/Whole Language Fraud,&quot; by Samuel Blumenfeld...available from Paradigm<br/>\nBooks. Blumenfeld also clears up the myth that people from New Zealand<br/>\n&quot;invented&quot; Whole Language, and that it was successful there. It was the same<br/>\nfailure there that it was in Israel, USSR, Cuba, and is today in our<br/>\ncountry. California has recently changed back from WL to phonics-based<br/>\nreading instruction because of the massive failure of WL that took the state<br/>\nfrom near the top to the very bottom in just ten years. Trouble is, they<br/>\nneed to retrain the teachers -- that&#39;s the hard part.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlumenfeld also tells the true history of the origin of Whole Language in a<br/>\nbook called &quot;The New Illiterates.&quot;  It was developed in about 1903 to teach<br/>\ndeaf people to read. Phonetic languages are difficult for people who can&#39;t<br/>\nhear or speak, since they have no concept of sound. Whole Language connected<br/>\nwords to pictures, allowing a person to make a connection between print and<br/>\nthe real world. It became popular in public schools in the twenties as<br/>\n&quot;look-say,&quot; but it is extremely limited, and as a learning method for<br/>\nhearing people it can be debilitating. Today, critics mockingly call it<br/>\n&quot;Look-Say-Fail.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe great &quot;success&quot; of WL is that it feeds millions of kids into Special<br/>\nEducation -- a fraud even worse, and more damaging, than the Whole Language<br/>\nmistakes it is purported to cure.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39771,"nextTopicId":39777}}
