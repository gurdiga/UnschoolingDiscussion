From what you<br/>\ndescribe of this team- he has made a very good decision.  I came from a<br/>\n&quot;sports&quot; family- I was on every team, because it was the only thing my dad<br/>\nthought was interesting I guess.  Anyway, I once quit a basketball team when<br/>\nI was a junior in high school.  I was torn up about the idea of &quot;quitting&quot;-<br/>\nuntil my former basketball coach, who was helping me with my predicament<br/>\nsaid- &quot;If your hand was in a machine that had this big mallet that was<br/>\npounding down on it rythmically, would you be a quitter if you took your<br/>\nhand out?&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, trust him.  And you saying, &quot;you know, I trust you and I realize you<br/>\ndidn&#39;t think it was going to be like this and your father and I know you are<br/>\nnot a quitter, you are just making a decision that you need to- don&#39;t worry<br/>\nabout the 75 dollars..&quot;  would be really cool- you guys are on the same<br/>\nside.  Think if you gave a 75 dollar gift to your very best friend, but she<br/>\ntook it back with no refund because it was causing her physical, emotional<br/>\nand mental harm (can&#39;t imagine what kind of gift that would be!- some<br/>\nnecklace that she was allergic to- ha!), you would definately not ask for<br/>\nthe money back.  The love for your kid is so much more than even your best<br/>\nfriend- the decision is quite simple when I think of it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHard to get out of the &quot;training your kid&quot; mind set, (as in &quot;he has to learn<br/>\nfollow-through and COMMItment!  he can&#39;t be a quitter! I&#39;ll teach him, he<br/>\nneeds to learn about consequences!&quot;) but really worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the new &quot;teach your own&quot; there is a part about a football coach who does<br/>\neverything differently- it doesnt have to suck so bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nlove, Bronwen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78646,"nextTopicId":78947}}
