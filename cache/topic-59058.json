It<br/>\nhas made an incredible difference in<br/>\nhomeschooling--every day unfolds so much more<br/>\nharmoniously now. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s wonderful.   It&#39;s as liberating for the parents as it is for the<br/>\nchildren when life together is a happy partnership.<br/>\n<br/>\n***On the other hand, what I find difficult about this<br/>\nlist is how often a power struggle develops that just<br/>\nseems to go and on and on.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it really a power struggle when only one participant is struggling?<br/>\nWhen there is a real disagreement, the folks who have a lot of time<br/>\ninvested in helping others continue to try to reach out.   That can look<br/>\nlike fueling the fire but when it&#39;s been the goal of someone for years to<br/>\nhelp facilitate understanding it&#39;s not really reasonable to expect them<br/>\nto just shut up and let a misunderstanding fester.   <br/>\nI admire people who step in and keep trying to explain a situation when<br/>\nsomeone is clearly not seeing it.   I can&#39;t do that.  I get too impatient<br/>\nand Joyce would have to smack me.   But others here are more patient and<br/>\ncontinue to believe there&#39;s a way to reach out.    Good for them!   Maybe<br/>\nthe one involved in the conflict won&#39;t come to any peaceful understanding<br/>\nbut someone lurking might be getting something they need, might hear that<br/>\none thing that can make the lights come on for them.   That&#39;d be worth<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n***If new people don&#39;t feel free to express doubts and<br/>\nconcerns along the way, they may very well give up <br/>\nprematurely.  There is a lot of deconditioning that<br/>\nhas to take place in unschooling, obviously, and it<br/>\nmay take some time to &quot;get it&quot;.***<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople (not just new people!)  can talk about their doubts and concerns<br/>\nall they need to.   Almost everyone here went to school and had to<br/>\novercome some kind of schoolish conditioning.    Being mean and<br/>\nemotionally immature is not recommend but it happens and eventually the<br/>\ntopic moves on to something better.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing to remember if you&#39;re new is that most questions get answered<br/>\nover and over again every few weeks.   Not everyone will respond at first<br/>\nif they&#39;ve just burned themselves out in the last weeks trying to explain<br/>\nor encourage.   You might have to ask again, you might have to wait a bit<br/>\nbut it&#39;s not that a poster or a question is being ignored.   Don&#39;t take<br/>\nit personally, it&#39;s just the timing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThings will lighten up if you hang around awhile.  And really there&#39;s a<br/>\nlot of learning can happen during these times when it just seems like<br/>\nbickering. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58921,"nextTopicId":58969}}
