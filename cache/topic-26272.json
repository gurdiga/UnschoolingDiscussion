Something to keep in mind though.  If your son is able to make a <br/>\nsmall group of homeschooling friends while he&#39;s young, say under about 10, <br/>\nhe&#39;s going to be a little less likely to want to go to school when he hits <br/>\nthe teens.  At least that&#39;s what happened in the opposite direction with my <br/>\nson.  I avoided the drive to town (time, gas) as much as possible when he <br/>\nwas younger.  Unfortunately, that&#39;s where the hs kids are.  There aren&#39;t <br/>\nany close to his age in our small town, so he has stuck to the friends he&#39;s <br/>\nmade playing sports.  They all go to school.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nTia Leschke   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island<br/>\n**************************************************************************<br/>\nIt is the answers which separate us, the questions which unite us. - Janice <br/>\nLevy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"brendaclaspell@aol.com","from":"brendaclaspell@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"RuBrgY6Y7S4xW9nioPyczJ6eZLCTRVqvcEt2UXRX4mo1S-bNxOvvSZhsUIuC7Z-E6cG8_lbTCW_lOeHY7A","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: John Holts take/age divisions and limitations wi...","postDate":"1001526949","msgId":26272,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNy4yMjc1MjNhLjI4ZTM3MGE1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26292,"prevInTime":26271,"nextInTime":26273,"topicId":26272,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/26/01 9:59:55 AM US Eastern Standard Time, ...
