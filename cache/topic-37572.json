When I didn&#39;t send <br/>\nthem to preschool she was upset, but blew it off with comments like &quot;Well in <br/>\na few years you will see! You will get tired of doing nothing all day and <br/>\nhaving them underfoot all the time...&quot; When Moly turned 5 and didn&#39;t go she <br/>\nsaid I would learn... When Moly turned 7 and it was time to &quot;legally&quot; declare <br/>\nour intent she almost died. Last fall when Jack went off to kindergarten I <br/>\nthought she was going to throw a party! When I explained that this was just <br/>\nfor this year and things would go back to normal after this, she said what I <br/>\ndo to the kids certainly isn&#39;t normal and I would change my mind by this time <br/>\nand next fall both kids would be in school where they belong. I have learned <br/>\nin the ten years I have been with my husband to tune her out and not let her <br/>\nvery personal remarks get to me. But the other day she called with a <br/>\nsuggestion and it *almost* sounded good to me. I know her ulterior motives <br/>\nare that she thinks the kids need all the help they can get since their Mom <br/>\nis utterly wacky! She told me she was going to send a box (that the kids can <br/>\ndecorate! &lt;her words&gt;) filled with note cards. On the cards she is going to <br/>\nwrite little phrases and words and the kids can take one out, write about it <br/>\nand send it to her. <br/>\nNow I don&#39;t think this is unschooling, and doubt it will go over too well <br/>\nwith either of the kids, although Jack (who enjoys writing) might turn it <br/>\ninto some kind of game. If one of them were to come to me and say &quot;I want you <br/>\nto give me some suggestions of things to write about.&quot; I might sit down and <br/>\nhelp them brainstorm, but wouldn&#39;t write out a bunch of cards. Am I wrong <br/>\nhere? <br/>\nI am thinking that now maybe the time for me to really explain what we do. It <br/>\nis getting hard for all of us to deal with her questions and comments. I <br/>\nthink she thinks we use some sort of curriculum, she questions the kids on <br/>\nindividual subjects, and asks me all sorts of questions about their &quot;school <br/>\nbooks&quot; and where do we get them. The problem with this isn&#39;t how I deal with <br/>\nher, I am just vague, the kids OTOH haven&#39;t learned that art yet. Do I call <br/>\nher up and say &quot;Hey, thanks for the writing box suggestion, but we don&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve in forced learning. BTW, the kids don&#39;t use a curriculum, we do <br/>\nwhat&#39;s called unschooling or child-led learning, we let them pick and choose <br/>\nfreely from all the world and this just doesn&#39;t fit our ideal. How about I <br/>\ngive you a book on unschooling?&quot; (wouldn&#39;t she just flip then?)  I just don&#39;t <br/>\nknow how to broach this subject with this woman! I would write a letter to a <br/>\nschool principal and let it all out, but don&#39;t know which way to turn when it <br/>\ncomes to my MIL! <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Is this Unschooling?","postDate":"1022553841","msgId":37572,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMC5lZTFhNTk3LjJhMjQ0OGYxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37576,"prevInTime":37571,"nextInTime":37573,"topicId":37572,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37601,"nextTopicId":37496}}
