At least tell him <br/>\nyou&#39;re changing your beliefs.  But then work to change them steadily and <br/>\ndirectly toward your goal.  Saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry I did that&quot; to a kid is invaluable in <br/>\nnurturing an authentic relationship with him as a whole human.  Not a mom/kid <br/>\nrelationship, but a person to person relationship.  Would you say &#39;sorry&#39; to a <br/>\nfriend you had wronged?  Would you try to make it up to a friend if you had <br/>\ndone something you regretted?  Treating children like friends is a big move in a <br/>\ngood direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111796,"nextTopicId":111795}}
