Fortunately, there are WAY more <br/>\nnurturing, cooing, welcoming types than there are those who will say &quot;Hey, <br/>\nthat&#39;s not going to work&quot; as they look over the shoulders of new unschoolers <br/>\nwho have come to an unschooling site to learn how to unschool.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we don&#39;t make a difference ANYWHERE between unschooling and not <br/>\nunschooling, there will be no difference between unschooling and sending kids <br/>\nto school.  Somewhere the line is.  Not exactly the same place for everyone, <br/>\nbut even if we average out everyone&#39;s lines there comes to be a &quot;you&#39;re <br/>\ngetting cold&quot; zone in which if people turn and go the other direction they <br/>\nare getting warmer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have honestly, truly, been people who have come to unschooling <br/>\ndiscussion areas and demanded for people to admit they were unschoolers even <br/>\nthough they had a curriculum, or were making their kids do math or making <br/>\nthem write book reports, or even (seriously) that their kids were back in <br/>\nschool, but they REALLY really (why?) wanted to be declared, certified <br/>\n&quot;unschoolers&quot; and would tear people up to try to get that.  Some people would <br/>\nsay &quot;Okay, then.  You&#39;re unschooling in your heart and that&#39;s what&#39;s <br/>\nimportant.&quot;   I would say, &quot;NO, in your heart, you&#39;re a looney.&quot;  Because I <br/>\nhave a great interest in defending the integrity of the idea of unschooling. <br/>\nen unschooling becomes a mush of vagueness which people cannot recognize, <br/>\nwant, do or defend.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs, it seems, I&#39;m one of the few who is brave enough to say to a stranger or <br/>\nan in-person friend, &quot;If you tell him he couldn&#39;t learn to read without you <br/>\nteaching him, why won&#39;t he think you have to teach him history and science?&quot; <br/>\nthen I do that.  And some people think it&#39;s too heavy handed to say &quot;You <br/>\nmight want to look at what you&#39;re doing with a critical eye and change it, or <br/>\nyou might want to stop saying you&#39;re unschooling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone in the forum said she didn&#39;t have time to explain things to her kids <br/>\nand she thought it was bad parenting to let kids figure stuff out on their <br/>\nown.  That is not unschooling.   Some people have said they unschool in the <br/>\nsummer, but during the school year they use structure.  That is not <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we&#39;re back to the honesty and truth thing again.  But we&#39;re to <br/>\nclarity and definitions even more.  Some things are vague and some things <br/>\naren&#39;t.  The edge of a foggy, swampy lake is not as distinct as the edge of a <br/>\npuddle in the sunshine in the desert.  Some people WANT unschooling to be an <br/>\nindistinct marshy area between school and wherever they are most comfortable <br/>\nbeing without too much thought.  It&#39;s not.  It&#39;s not school-like and it&#39;s not <br/>\nschool-parallel or school-based.  The sooner people clear their vision and <br/>\nstop looking through the fog toward the school, the sooner they&#39;ll be <br/>\noperational in unschooling.  I don&#39;t see it doing anyone a favor to tell them <br/>\nto take their time in that swamp and come on out when they want to.  They <br/>\ncan&#39;t come out until they want to, but sometimes they hear a sound on the <br/>\nnon-school side that makes them turn and look.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do. <br/>\n Make it clearer and more attractive and more understandable so they don&#39;t <br/>\nwaste time foundering around unnecessarily.  I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s <br/>\ndirect, either, which is good! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16304,"nextTopicId":16201}}
