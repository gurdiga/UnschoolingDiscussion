I tried with my eldest - for about 30 seconds and gave up. It was just not something I could do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ended up going to his room night after night and when the second one came around, she slept in our bed from day. I regret not taking my eldest into our bed from day too. I feel he has missed out on so much, and that time is now gone. I can never get it back. Too bad we sometimes listen to bad parenting advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nDalene<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48182,"nextTopicId":48184}}
