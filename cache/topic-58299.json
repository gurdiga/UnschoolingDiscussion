It&#39;s very gentle and accepting of where<br/>\npeople are and their ability to find what works for them and their families.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the list is *not* a list to help people find what works for their<br/>\nfamilies. It&#39;s unschooling. And unschooling *is* a specific philosophy with<br/>\ngoals that are different from any other form of homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it helps to look at the advice *not* as what you *should* do but<br/>\n*what* to shoot for and *how* to shoot for it *if* you want to be an<br/>\nunschooler. (I don&#39;t think anyone here feels they&#39;ve reached the goal. We<br/>\n*all* need to keep working towards it.) If someone wants to modify the goal<br/>\nfor their own family, then they can pick and choose what sounds good to them<br/>\nand reject the rest. But the pickers and choosers need to respect that their<br/>\nneeds getting to their goal shouldn&#39;t interfere with others getting to<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people sign onto the list they are in essence saying they want to<br/>\nfigure out how to get to that goal called unschooling. So *not* telling<br/>\npeople when they get off the path would not be helpful to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we&#39;re doing is like dicussing vegetarianism. People who join the list<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to become vegetarians. They could pick and choose the advice and<br/>\nmodify it to eat less meat. But they need to respect that the list is for<br/>\npeople who *are* trying to do something very specific.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone says &quot;Wait, I don&#39;t like that advice. That&#39;s too radical for my<br/>\nneeds because I don&#39;t like beans so I need you to help me incorporate ground<br/>\nbeef *not* tell me how to avoid it,&quot; or &quot;I like vegetarianism but I worry<br/>\nabout getting enough protein so I always mix in some chicken to make sure I<br/>\nget enough protein,&quot; then they&#39;re interfering with those who want to go the<br/>\nwhole way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s even more difficult for unschoolers. Society has filled us chock full<br/>\nof fears. It is *very* easy to fall back on standard methods that ease those<br/>\nfears. But finding ways to ease fears isn&#39;t what the list is about. It isn&#39;t<br/>\nabout finding our comfort zone on the path to unschooling. It isn&#39;t about<br/>\nfinding what works for our families. It&#39;s about finding out how to get from<br/>\nwhere we are to where we want to go. For most people getting where they&#39;re<br/>\ndetermined to go means spending a fair amount of time in a *discomfort*<br/>\nzone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people who will get the most from this list are the ones who want to get<br/>\nwhere the list is helping people get to. It would *not* be helpful to get on<br/>\na list headed for New York City if you want to go to Miami ;-) But if<br/>\nsomeone wants one of the stops along the way or want the general direction,<br/>\nthe list can be useful. Then additional lists might help them with the<br/>\nspecifics of the place they want to stop at.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be this list isn&#39;t going to meet your needs. It *can&#39;t* expand to<br/>\nbe about what works for each family because then it would cease to be about<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":105774918,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Anderson sa & lonely in group","postDate":"1044860664","msgId":58396,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMyZDBkMiRhOTNiMjM5MCQzNDAwYThjMEByb2J5bm1hY2hpbmU+","inReplyToHeader":"PGIyN2dpOCtpMm50QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58395,"nextInTopic":58409,"prevInTime":58395,"nextInTime":58397,"topicId":58299,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Gosh!

To her surprise, she did get a couple of phone <br/>\ncalls. Neither of the people lived right next door, but they were <br/>\nwithin distance to be able to get together a few times a month.

It is just a question of the naming. I could have used the<br/>\nanalogy that a group of vegans might not consider someone who described<br/>\nthemselves as &quot;a vegan except for chocolate milkshakes&quot; a &quot;Vegan&quot;,<br/>\nalthough that would be a perfectly valid dietary choice. <br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing this food analogy, it was not until I became a vegetarian<br/>\nabout 15 years ago, that I realized how much meat I ate on a daily<br/>\nbasis, always believing that I ate very little. Friends would always<br/>\nsay, on hearing of my conversion, &quot;Oh I don&#39;t eat much meat&quot;, evidently<br/>\noperating under same belief I had entertained (and feeling defensive,<br/>\nbut that&#39;s another issue). Perhaps it is not until people renounce the<br/>\ncontrol and &quot;requirements&quot; that they realize how much these attitudes<br/>\naffect their relationships with their children. Others have said this<br/>\nkind of thing better before. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the replies, I don&#39;t think there is any disagreement here on the<br/>\noriginal question, which was whether &quot;requiring a journal&quot; could<br/>\naccurately be called unschooling in any universe. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHow important is the name? Well, I&#39;m feeling lonely in my local support<br/>\ngroup/e-list at the moment, since there are no other unschoolers there<br/>\nanymore. One person on our list talked about how they have been almost<br/>\nunschooling and she doesn&#39;t feel comfortable with that. I have yet to<br/>\nsee her to ask her about it. Another has recently asked how to make her<br/>\nson write reports. A proud former Middle School English teacher sent a<br/>\nmultipage treatise on how to write school reports properly step by step,<br/>\nto be greeted with acclaim, and the one lone voice who suggested that<br/>\nmaybe he didn&#39;t need to write reports right now was vilified as being<br/>\nunhelpful. We have a lot of Unit Studies proponents in the group. One<br/>\nparent was worried about math with her reluctant son, expressing how her<br/>\nfears were causing tension in their relationship - I suggested with<br/>\nutmost gentleness that there might be some helpful information at<br/>\nSandra&#39;s site - to help her feel less stressed about doing it NOW and<br/>\nnot &quot;falling behind&quot;. It was not well taken. <br/>\n<br/>\nYet these parents are so much more pleasant to be around than &quot;regular&quot;<br/>\nschooling parents, who mediate every interaction their kids have with<br/>\nothers, constantly yell &quot;be careful&quot; and &quot;YOU MUST SHARE&quot; etc. and whose<br/>\nconversation is totally about getting their children to do their<br/>\nhomework. :-(  The primary purpose of going to our weekly Park Day is<br/>\nfor our children to have fun and enhance their relationships with each<br/>\nother, for which purpose we avoid parks that are well attended by other<br/>\ngroups, nannies and preschools. Still I don&#39;t feel safe enough to &quot;come<br/>\nout&quot; as an unschooler. Since Jayn is three, I don&#39;t know how seriously I<br/>\nwould be taken anyway. It makes me nervous when I hear about some of the<br/>\nother folk on this list who have told us about their kids being shunned.<br/>\nPerhaps I have contempt prior to investigation, and what I do will be<br/>\nroundly ignored by the others in my group as totally irrelevant to them.<br/>\nThe fact is I don&#39;t have any other friends with children, except one<br/>\ncouple who are friends of my dh, and are public schooling spankers of<br/>\ntheir 5 yo. The first question I get asked when I tell regular people I<br/>\nam homeschooling is about curriculum. They don&#39;t ask about socialization<br/>\n- usually treating me to a lecture on the subject instead!  *sigh* I<br/>\njust want Jayn to be able to play with the same few kids regularly and<br/>\nsit pleasantly and admire each other&#39;s great kids and their imaginative<br/>\ngames. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I feel like I am letting down the side with silence. Recently<br/>\none mother (new to the group) was speaking of the Zero Tolerance for<br/>\nhitting policy they have in their home. If their six yo son hits or<br/>\npunches he is sent straight to bed until tomorrow, &quot;even if it is 10 in<br/>\nthe morning&quot;. She was watching a rowdy boys&#39; game unfolding, with great<br/>\napprehension. How can I, as the mother of a 3yo girl, say, &quot;I think your<br/>\npolicy is well intentioned but dumb; what will it do to your son&#39;s<br/>\nability to express his feelings and feel safe in his home?&quot;, even if<br/>\nthat is how I feel. I would hardly blame her if she returned &quot;Mind your<br/>\nown business!&quot;  She is likely to learn much more by watching the<br/>\nbeautiful interactions between one mother of four boys and her<br/>\nexpressive and intelligent sons, who are regulars at Park Day. Oh well.<br/>\nAt least in my home we are unrestricted and full of the joy of this<br/>\nlifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom]  J.

Perhaps there is no distinct, absolute<br/>\ndefinition(??), but I think having some defining characteristics will be<br/>\nmore helpful than not.  I don&#39;t think people should be offended if they are<br/>\ntold that what they are doing is not unschooling, if unschooling is what<br/>\nthey *want* to be doing.  Of course we each need to find our own way within<br/>\nour own family.  There are too many human variables for someone to say that<br/>\nall parents must do XYZ exactly the same way.  But that doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>\nunschooling is replicating a school in your home.  If I think that I am<br/>\nunschooling, while &quot;of course requiring&quot; and that is not really the essence<br/>\nof unschooling, I would rather someone tell me that.  Defining unschooling<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean that I must unschool.  I am still free to do what I think is<br/>\nbest for my children.  But I shouldn&#39;t say we unschool if we really don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is why the wording in that essay bothered me.  I understood that<br/>\nunschooling means the parent doesn&#39;t require any &quot;school work&quot; of their<br/>\nchildren.  Then I read the essay at unschooling.com that claims &quot;of course<br/>\nwe require&quot; [journal keeping and kitchen table math].  The &quot;of course we<br/>\nrequire&quot; implies that unschooling means the parent needs to make the child<br/>\ndo some academic work.  Is that unschooling or isn&#39;t it?  And if it isn&#39;t,<br/>\nthan the essay shouldn&#39;t be at unschooling.com or it should have a<br/>\ndisclaimer explaining that some of the content is not from an exclusive<br/>\nunschooling viewpoint.<br/>\n<br/>\nI worked with La Leche League for many years.  I never told anybody that<br/>\n100% exclusive breastfeeding was what *they should* do.  But if someone<br/>\nasked for information about breastfeeding, I would be doing them a<br/>\ndisservice if I said that breastfeeding works great even if you use formula<br/>\nwhenever it &quot;works for your family&quot;.  It doesn&#39;t mean that someone is right<br/>\nor wrong to use formula, but it does mean that baby/mother pair will not<br/>\nreceive the same results and benefits as they would if they exclusively<br/>\nbreastfed.  The mother should then realize that she combines breastfeeding<br/>\nwith formula; she is not exclusively breastfeeding.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe we need partial unschooling and complete unschooling?  Is that<br/>\npossible?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what I think some are saying about unschooling - that we need to<br/>\ntrust our children in everything, not trust them in everything but math, or<br/>\neverything but feeding themselves, for instance.  It doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>\nchildren are left totally to their own devices either.  Parents provide an<br/>\nenvironment that includes math/food/etc., and are available to guide and<br/>\nassist their children in using math/food/etc., and trust that children will<br/>\nuse math/food/etc., as they need to without the parent requiring it of them.<br/>\nGoing beyond that, arithmetic and food are things that we use to accomplish<br/>\nour goals in life, but they are not the end goals by themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom]  J.

It would benefit the <br/>\nold-timers who perhaps are all for complete, pure unschooling to help those <br/>\nof us who are new to this concept come to it in a gentle way which is of <br/>\ncourse a process.  And who is to say what unschooling is or isn&#39;t.  In our <br/>\nsociety we don&#39;t naturally think unschooling is the way to go, just as we are <br/>\ntrained to think we need OBs to have babies. <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel for now if my children and I can work together towards some sort of <br/>\nprocess that satisfies us both and allows them to grow into adults who can <br/>\nfunction in our society and &quot;unschooling&quot; is the way to do it, then I think <br/>\nthat is great.
