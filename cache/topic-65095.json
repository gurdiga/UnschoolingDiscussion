Children are confused and hurt byunsuppo...  &gt; Dont think of it as running away from something &quot;bad&quot; as much as running  &gt; toward something much much better.   If your girls do not want to be  involved  &gt; in thier fathers life ( and I suspect, if they do, its only out of guilt  and  &gt; obligation, considering the way he is treating them).. Then RUN as fast as  &gt; you can.. straight toward peace and productivity.  Something else to look at.  He might fight your moving away.  Some dads do.  If it looked to a judge like you were moving *in order to* get them away,  and not for some other perfectly good reason (like a job change) you might  not be allowed to take them.  Also, as far as homeschooling them goes, make  sure that you haven&#39;t agreed to give him a say in their education.  The laws  vary, but where I live, sharing guardianship (as opposed to custody) gives  both parents a say in religious and educational issues.  (I found that out  the hard way with my older son.)  And judges tend to go with the &quot;norm&quot; in  those areas.  It seems to be harder (from what I&#39;ve seen) to make a change  *to* homeschooling after the divorce than to keep on homeschooling after a  divorce.  Judges tend to want to keep things as much the same as possible  for the kids.  Not meant to scare but just a heads up.  Tia  &quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary  saftety deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;  Ben Franklin  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a>        Yahoo!

I&#39;ts written right in my divorce agreement that Tara&#39;s dadand I have to &quot;consult one another on questions of religion, discipline,financial, moral, social, recreational and legal matters, school andeducational programs, changes in social environment, and non emergencyhealth care, both dental and medical.&quot;Luckily for me he never really questioned anything but when I wanted to pullher from school to homeschool her, he balked at that big time. Being that Ihad such a rough time in court before regarding Tara, I wasn&#39;t willing tochance doing it again for homeschooling. But like you saidm this came afterthe divorce and from what I was told, did make a difference.

I&#39;ts written right in my divorce agreement that Tara&#39;s dad<br/>\nand I have to &quot;consult one another on questions of religion, discipline,<br/>\nfinancial, moral, social, recreational and legal matters, school and<br/>\neducational programs, changes in social environment, and non emergency<br/>\nhealth care, both dental and medical.&quot;<br/>\nLuckily for me he never really questioned anything but when I wanted to pull<br/>\nher from school to homeschool her, he balked at that big time. Being that I<br/>\nhad such a rough time in court before regarding Tara, I wasn&#39;t willing to<br/>\nchance doing it again for homeschooling. But like you saidm this came after<br/>\nthe divorce and from what I was told, did make a difference. If she was<br/>\nhomeschooling before the divorce, I would have had a much better chance<br/>\nkeeping things that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3899762,"authorName":"coyote&#39;s corner","from":"&quot;coyote&#39;s corner&quot; &lt;jana@...&gt;","profile":"calourojm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Need Help!
