I can&#39;t <br/>\nsee going alone with three kids, and there is no one else to keep my kids or <br/>\ngo with me. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo he says we will find a way to go, if I really want to. I am totally <br/>\nintimidated by the thought. We don&#39;t go on fancy family vacations, we own a <br/>\ncamper and keep things cheap. I feel bad that we would have to spend so much <br/>\nand drag him along and it&#39;s not really his thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nMegan wants to go. At first she just wanted to be really close to Myrtle <br/>\nBeach, thinking my mom would go and take the kids to the beach while i did <br/>\nthe conference. My mom isn&#39;t going. She is taking off 2 weeks in August to go <br/>\nto Alaska on a trip she swears she can&#39;t afford. But she is still going, <br/>\nputting it all on yet another credit card. She said if she wasn&#39;t already <br/>\nplanning Alaska, she would love to go to Myrtle Beach again. She knows I <br/>\ndon&#39;t do big expensive vacations, so two years ago she paid for our hotel for <br/>\na week so we would go with her and my siblings. It still cost us big bucks in <br/>\nfood, gasoline, and unpaid time off for dh. She is still paying on the credit <br/>\ncard from that trip. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur lifestyle doesn&#39;t afford us to travel the world on credit cards the way <br/>\nshe does. We bought a big house(long story, but we couldn&#39;t pass the offer <br/>\nup) two years ago and it&#39;s all we can do to keep to a budget on one income. <br/>\nSo I am really in a bind trying to figure out if we will do this. I am <br/>\nterrible at making decisions anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nMegan, my 10yo, really wants to go. She heard there is a talent show &lt;g&gt; She <br/>\nwas afraid of missing the talent shows when she quit school, even though she <br/>\nwould have had to try out and possibly not make the cut. So she decided to <br/>\nstart reading my frugal books yesterday so we can do this as a family. She is <br/>\nreading Miserly Moms, and has been carrying The Complete Tightwad Gazette <br/>\naround, hoping she can inspire us to tighten up even more to make this trip. <br/>\n<br/>\nGod love her. She has more courage than I do. I am worried the used Volvo <br/>\nwould break down on the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat to do, what to do. Worry and guilt, worry and guilt. Anxiety and fear of <br/>\nfailure.  I need to make a decision soon. <br/>\n<br/>\nAng the hopeless neurotic<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68887,"nextTopicId":22691}}
