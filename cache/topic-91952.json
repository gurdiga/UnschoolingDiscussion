I am an unschooler who is trying to <br/>\nadjust to working and handing over 80% of the at home stuff to my <br/>\nnewly unemployed dh.  We are redesigning our life, he is finishing <br/>\nschool and becoming a piano teacher/tuner. I teach drama, creative <br/>\nwriting and history to homeschoolers, and also work for a tutoring <br/>\nagency...life has gone from highly structured to wildly hit and <br/>\nmiss. I am finally starting to get accustomed, but now we are moving <br/>\nto the other side of the state! I have three daughters and they are <br/>\ngreat, way more adjustable than their mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used Seton tests last year and they were, by far, the least <br/>\nexpensive and least time consuming way to honor the testing <br/>\nregulation. They were 25.00 a piece and that included scoring. They <br/>\ndo not give much added info or commentary, which was fine, because I <br/>\ndidnt care to have it. It did show me which areas my children had <br/>\nnot worked on that year(or at all, really) such as some language <br/>\nmechanics, capitalization and punctuation. This was just <br/>\ninformation, nothing I worried about or that affected my plan for <br/>\nthe next year. My youngest did worry about it, so I bought her a <br/>\ncouple of workbooks to practice, if and when she wanted to. She did <br/>\nand those things improved. The other two didnt really care. They <br/>\nseem to learn that stuff when they need it, in the context of <br/>\nwanting something they write to make more sense to them and to <br/>\nwhoever is reading it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThats all, thanks for being there. Hope I helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91984,"nextTopicId":92006}}
