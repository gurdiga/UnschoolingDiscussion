Sheryl<br/>\nSamuel, a<br/>\n                            Stone Ridge mother who homeschooled her son Seth<br/>\n                            throughout his entire educational career, says<br/>\nthat one<br/>\n                            fringe benefit is learning along with your child.<br/>\n<br/>\n                            &quot;Nothing says that you can&#39;t master algebra at<br/>\n                            thirty-five, but if you&#39;d rather not, all you<br/>\nneed to do is<br/>\n                            look around and find mentors. People who love a<br/>\n                            subject are often eager to share it, whether<br/>\nfor money,<br/>\n                            for barter�maybe the child comes and does yard<br/>\n                            work�or just for the satisfaction of teaching,&quot;<br/>\nSamuel<br/>\n                            says. Her son went for long walks with a retired<br/>\n                            physicist. &quot;They&#39;d kick a soccer ball around<br/>\nand talk<br/>\n                            about the physics of that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                            THE SOCIAL SCENE<br/>\n                            Samuel believes that although the socialization<br/>\nchildren<br/>\n                            receive while being homeschooled may be of a<br/>\ndifferent<br/>\n                            variety than what takes place on the<br/>\nplayground, it is not<br/>\n                            lacking. &quot;At one point, we started to get so<br/>\ninvolved<br/>\n                            with our homeschooling network that we had to<br/>\nmake a<br/>\n                            conscious effort to pull back and take some<br/>\ntime for<br/>\n                            ourselves. It&#39;s really as social or as private<br/>\nas you want<br/>\n                            it to be,&quot; she says.<br/>\n<br/>\n                            A &quot;typical&quot; day of homeschooling can contain any<br/>\n                            number of ingredients. For example, a trip to<br/>\nthe store<br/>\n                            can turn into a lesson in economics; a daily<br/>\nnewspaper<br/>\n                            can become a lesson in language arts.<br/>\nHomeschoolers<br/>\n                            stress that not only are lessons all around,<br/>\nbut children<br/>\n                            are, by nature, interested in learning them.<br/>\n<br/>\n                            THE LOCAL BUREAUCRACY<br/>\n                            Dealing with school district personnel can be<br/>\neasy or<br/>\n                            onerous, depending on the person in charge. Some<br/>\n                            school districts have appointed staff who deal<br/>\n                            specifically with homeschooling. In other<br/>\nplaces, this<br/>\n                            task falls to anyone from the harassed<br/>\nsecretary to the<br/>\n                            school superintendent.<br/>\n<br/>\n                            School districts are afforded a great deal of<br/>\nlatitude by<br/>\n                            state regulations. They may decide on a case by<br/>\ncase<br/>\n                            basis whether to assist homeschoolers by loaning<br/>\n                            textbooks, allowing the use of libraries or<br/>\nparticipation<br/>\n                            in clubs and so on. Because some districts have<br/>\nliability<br/>\n                            and educational-process concerns, homeschoolers<br/>\noften<br/>\n                            cannot rely on them for much help, a situation<br/>\nthat has<br/>\n                            contributed to the vitality of the networks<br/>\nthat these<br/>\n                            people have formed on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\n                            THE EVALUATION PROCESS<br/>\n                            How do homeschoolers do in life? As with the<br/>\nreasons<br/>\n                            for homeschooling and the structure used to<br/>\nachieve it,<br/>\n                            the answers are as varied as the families<br/>\ninvolved. Those<br/>\n                            who go on to college have attended schools such as<br/>\n                            Antioch, Hampshire, Cornell, Harvard, Cal Poly<br/>\n                            Technical and others. Obviously, there are<br/>\n                            homeschoolers out there doing something right.<br/>\n<br/>\n                            But what about doing it wrong? What are the<br/>\npitfalls<br/>\n                            that would cause home education to fail?<br/>\n<br/>\n                            Glenn Nystrup of the Hudson Valley Learning Center<br/>\n                            has worked with many homeschoolers as a tutor and<br/>\n                            mentor and has seen both highly successful<br/>\nsituations<br/>\n                            and those that don&#39;t work as well. &quot;It can be<br/>\ntough for<br/>\n                            kids to accept that kind of authority from a<br/>\nparent and<br/>\n                            tough for them to start thinking of home as<br/>\nschool,&quot;<br/>\n                            Nystrup says. &quot;I&#39;ve seen people start out with<br/>\nvery good<br/>\n                            intentions, run into resistance from the kids<br/>\nand just<br/>\n                            never build up the momentum they need to<br/>\nfulfill their<br/>\n                            child&#39;s potential.&quot; He advises seeking<br/>\nassistance from<br/>\n                            individuals like mentors and tutors or from<br/>\nprograms like<br/>\n                            the E-School�started by Nystrup and partner Bram<br/>\n                            Morenis�which offers guidance for homeschooling<br/>\n                            families.<br/>\n<br/>\n                            Clearly, the main requirements for success are<br/>\nnot a<br/>\n                            teaching degree or an independent fortune, but<br/>\n                            dedication, enthusiasm and sincere enjoyment of<br/>\nyour<br/>\n                            child&#39;s company.<br/>\n<br/>\n                            &quot;I highly recommend it to anyone who genuinely<br/>\nenjoys<br/>\n                            spending lots of time with their children,&quot;<br/>\nSamuel says.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brynlee@...\">brynlee@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"John O.
