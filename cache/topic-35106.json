There&#39;s one called &quot;The Twa Sisters&quot; (still <br/>\npronounced) and in &quot;The Twa Corbies,&quot; which is in Scots dialect, the &quot;twa&quot; is <br/>\npronounced in the text.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt lasted longer in Scotland than England, that pronunciation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of the rhythm and rhyme of ballads, there will be whole phrases which <br/>\nare obsolete in spoken or written use, but still sung and passed on because <br/>\nthe ballad doesn&#39;t make sense without it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Matty Groves, a version collected in the SE U.S., one verse is:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m standin&#39; here with two swords by my side<br/>\nThey cost me deep in purse<br/>\nI&#39;ll give to you the best o&#39; them<br/>\nand I will take the worst, worst, and I will take the worst.<br/>\n<br/>\nLibrary-collectors would probably change that &quot;worst&quot; to &quot;worse&quot; for <br/>\ngrammatical perfection, but whatever.  The &quot;cost me deep in purse&quot; definitely <br/>\ndates the text from when men carried their money in purses (little belt <br/>\npouches).  And there&#39;s a Ben Jonson song about a cutpurse.   Cutpurse was a <br/>\npickpocket.  But the name was from literally slipping by, bumping someone, <br/>\nand at the same time cutting the cords of leather or whatever that held a <br/>\npurse on a belt, or that held it closed.  So in the 17th century, there were <br/>\nstill pouches in use.  The song is considered to be older than that, but from <br/>\njust that purse clue it goes back at least to 17th C.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34855,"nextTopicId":7522}}
