It sounded to me, like you were so concerned about <br/>\ndisrespecting Elliot&#39;s wishes that you lost sight of what was <br/>\nhappening.  If this kid thinks you are condoning his behavior, I <br/>\nshudder to think what he will do if you are not around.  You, as an <br/>\nadult and property owner have the right to discourage that type of <br/>\nbehaviour.  To be honest, if I see any kids treating a child, not my <br/>\nown, that way I would step in.  I see it at the park sometimes.  Kids <br/>\nthinking they can get nasty when there parents are not around.  I <br/>\ngive them a hellavu look and then intervene.  It is not about control <br/>\nbut protection.  When someone becomes *weaker* in a situation like <br/>\nthis, they sometimes need help.   If I am not comfortable with a <br/>\nchild, if I think he is harming my children then I will step in.  My <br/>\nchildren will NOT play with them and I am honest to my children about <br/>\nwhy.  There are times I reserve the right to play *parent*.  This <br/>\nchild is wounding your children&#39;s self-esteem far more than you would <br/>\nbe by intervening. You could also just call your children inside and <br/>\nthen go out and deal with him so it does not look like you are coming <br/>\nin as your child&#39;s aide.  It sounds like Elliot may be afraid of <br/>\nlooking like a *baby* or *whimp* so he does not want you to get <br/>\ninvolved, but sending an 8 yo to deal with a 13yo is not a fair <br/>\nbattle.  Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73201,"nextTopicId":73790}}
