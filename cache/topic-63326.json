One sure way to put that in jeopardy is to become<br/>\nsome sort of schoolteacher to them. It changes your role from loving,<br/>\nreassuring, nurturing to judge, jury and taskmaster. You have enough to do<br/>\njust being a good parent. Answer their questions, but don&#39;t decide what they<br/>\nneed to think about or do. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe big thing is trust. Tell them that you trust them. Mean it. Do it. They<br/>\nwill always love you for that. If you don&#39;t have trust, you will definitely<br/>\nregret it. It starts now. You have to earn it every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAbove by Ned</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63320,"nextTopicId":266}}
