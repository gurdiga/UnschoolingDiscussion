I thought I would just take<br/>\n                some time today to let you know more<br/>\n                about our unschooling. The things we do<br/>\n                and how the children learn. But first, let<br/>\n                me elaborate on the general idea of<br/>\n                unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n                Unschooling can mean something different to each and every<br/>\n                person. There is no one universal definition. For our<br/>\nfamily, it means<br/>\n                that the children are permitted to learn what they want,<br/>\nwhen they<br/>\n                want, how they want. Of course, there are exceptions to<br/>\nthis. If<br/>\n                Evan, who will be 10, would want to study flight by pushing<br/>\nhis<br/>\n                sister off the garage, that would be denied. But if Brenna,<br/>\nwho is a<br/>\n                6-year-old, wanted to learn about fractions today by making<br/>\nsome<br/>\n                cookies, that would be fine. And if Evan didn�t want to<br/>\nlearn then,<br/>\n                that would be ok too. If Cora, who is 8, wanted to do some<br/>\nKrampf<br/>\n                science experiments at 10:30 at night, that would not be<br/>\nok. But it<br/>\n                would be fine for her to do them during the daytime.<br/>\n<br/>\n                Do you see what I mean? We do have some rules here, but we<br/>\nstill<br/>\n                let the children learn, as they feel led. I know that there<br/>\nare some<br/>\n                radical unschoolers out there that would allow their<br/>\nchildren to do<br/>\n                things that are not permitted here. Our children have<br/>\nchores and<br/>\n                responsibilities they need to tend to each day, and breathing<br/>\n                doesn�t count as one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n                Unschooling means learning about history by going to the<br/>\n                museums, by asking Grandpa about his childhood, by watching<br/>\n                videos like Gone with the Wind. But not by forcing the<br/>\nchild to sit<br/>\n                and do a chapter out of the history book and answer the twenty<br/>\n                questions in the back.<br/>\n<br/>\n                Let�s compare unschooling to cooking. Let�s say you have been<br/>\n                cooking everything for the children for a long time.<br/>\nSuddenly, you<br/>\n                want the children to cook (unschool) for themselves. They<br/>\nwon&#39;t do<br/>\n                it, and you don&#39;t understand how they can eat peanut butter<br/>\nand<br/>\n                jelly for six weeks straight! (Play Nintendo and read comic<br/>\nbooks.)<br/>\n                After a while, they figure out that you are not going to<br/>\ncook (teach<br/>\n                them with curriculum) and they start cooking (learning) on<br/>\ntheir own.<br/>\n<br/>\n                Soon, they are making gourmet meals, things you never thought<br/>\n                they would! (Doing all kinds of educational things.) They<br/>\nwon&#39;t even<br/>\n                be thinking of it as learning. It will be something they<br/>\nwant to do on<br/>\n                their own. They will be on fire to learn more, and to share<br/>\nthe things<br/>\n                they are learning with others. In the meantime, the<br/>\nchildren did not<br/>\n                starve, nor did they stop learning. They just needed to<br/>\nfind that<br/>\n                something that they wanted to cook, or learn about. And<br/>\ngiven the<br/>\n                time and space, they will find that something. Now, let�s<br/>\nget on to<br/>\n                some hands on examples of our learning. Math at our house<br/>\nis best<br/>\n                done with board games: Monopoly, Rummikub, Uno, Chess, and<br/>\n                various card games. Of course, there is a lot to learn<br/>\nabout in<br/>\n                comparative shopping. And what child do you know that isn�t<br/>\ngoing<br/>\n                to become vocal over getting fewer cookies than the other<br/>\nchildren<br/>\n                do?<br/>\n<br/>\n                How about Language Arts? Well, reading naturally, is done with<br/>\n                reading. Whether the child is reading Shakespeare or the<br/>\nlatest TV<br/>\n                Guide, the reading skills are still being used. Writing a<br/>\nletter or an<br/>\n<br/>\n                email to anyone, be it a pen pal or Grandma, is grammar and<br/>\n                spelling. Scrabble is a great game for spelling practice, too!<br/>\n<br/>\n                For Science, we often do experiments at home. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Krampf@...\">Krampf@...</a> <br/>\n                emails out free ones every Monday morning. Drop him a line and<br/>\n                ask to be added to the list. There are some really great<br/>\nshows on<br/>\n                PBS for science, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n                Social Studies are the easiest subject to cover for our<br/>\nfamily. We all<br/>\n                love those museums! We also read a lot of biographies. Which<br/>\n                biography we read depends upon our interests at the time.<br/>\nIt could<br/>\n                be Christopher Columbus one week and John F. Kennedy the next.<br/>\n                I never know where the children are going to lead us next.<br/>\n<br/>\n                We do a lot of history learning with videos, too. Gone with<br/>\nthe Wind,<br/>\n                Titanic, Roots, all of those are wonderful. But, watch<br/>\nthose with<br/>\n                more than a grain of salt, as I am sure you realize.<br/>\nHollywood likes<br/>\n                to embellish more than a little sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n                In the upcoming issues, I will be taking the individual<br/>\nsubjects and<br/>\n                showing you in a deeper way how they play a part in our<br/>\nevery day<br/>\n                lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n                The most difficult thing about unschooling is that YOU, the<br/>\nmom<br/>\n                and dad, must unlearn all that school stuff. Forget what is<br/>\n                appropriate for a 3rd grader. Who cares if the 7th grader<br/>\nis reading<br/>\n                Good Night Moon? So what if the Kindergartner wants to work on<br/>\n                dividing fractions? Just relax and let them do the<br/>\nlearning. They will,<br/>\n                given the time and the room to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n                 For unschooling to work, it is a matter of the parents<br/>\nlearning to<br/>\n                trust the children with their own education. I know that is<br/>\na hard<br/>\n                thing to do, but stop and ponder it for just a few minutes.<br/>\nThere is<br/>\n                no proof for you to see that the children will learn<br/>\nwithout you there,<br/>\n                guiding them, and directing them. But, if you do take this<br/>\nstep, our<br/>\n                family has found you will see results very soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n                When you became a Christian, it was the same way. You had no<br/>\n                �proof�, yet you took that step of faith, and now look at<br/>\nall the<br/>\n                wonders in your life! Unschooling is just trusting God one<br/>\nmore<br/>\n                time.<br/>\n<br/>\n                Copyright � 1999 Jeanne Musfeldt <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                Awards | About EH | Contact Us | Writers| Linking to this<br/>\nsite | Advertise |<br/>\n                               Reprinting Articles | Search<br/>\n<br/>\n                This website is copyright �1997, 1998, 1999 Beverly S.<br/>\nKrueger All rights reserved. <br/>\n<br/>\n                This site was authored by Beverly S.
