I have<br/>\na very hard time in summer getting motivated. Now that it&#39;s down into the 90&#39;s<br/>\nthings will be getting better soon. Baking will start. Outdoor activities, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour stress will wax and wane, too. Pretend he&#39;s a big three. Have fun. Do stuff<br/>\nfor YOU. Watch TV.

The other twelve he&#39;s awake, moving, <br/>\nlooking, hearing and communicating, I&#39;m guessing.
