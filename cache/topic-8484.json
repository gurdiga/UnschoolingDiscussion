I am having a <br/>\ndifficult time deciding about my curriculum.  I have evaluated the <br/>\nunschooling, but I am not sure that I understand it even yet.  It <br/>\nseems like a very relaxed home atmosphere, and learning about life <br/>\nexperiences instead of directly from textbooks.  I think this would <br/>\nbe a good route to take for my children, I&#39;d like to include some <br/>\nBible study, and allow my oldest child to move at a pace desirable <br/>\nfor him (he is interested in computers and electronics).  However, <br/>\nlike I said, I&#39;m not sure I really understand it, and what does the <br/>\nlaw say about this kind of schooling....(ie)what are the &quot;rules&quot;?  I <br/>\nsee that most people here are from PA?  I am from Arkansas...is there <br/>\nanyone else from here that understands our state law on the subject?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter how much I read on different types of homeschooling, I <br/>\nsuppose I&#39;ll just have to grasp it myself to fully understand it, and <br/>\nwhat my obligations and regulations are....I have to keep records and <br/>\nsuch?  Anyone that can help, please feel free....although I must warn <br/>\nyou, I may drive you crazy until I understand what I am doing  =)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth Thompson</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8481,"nextTopicId":8488}}
