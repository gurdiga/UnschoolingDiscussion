Furthermore, only<br/>\nrecently (in my thirties) have gotten really into world history.  Now I read<br/>\nbook after book about it.  At 16, it about killed me to read half a<br/>\ntextboook (which is all we used).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My girlfriend read it to her son last year.  They really enjoyed it. The author<br/>\n&gt;wrote more books.  I can&#39;t think of the names off hand. Do you know any other<br/>\n&gt;books for chidren  of 7 to 9?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hazel, do you mean math books specifically, since that was the original book<br/>\nI mentioned....or just any books?  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know any other<br/>\ngreat math stories, but boooks.....<br/>\n<br/>\nChores -- Joyce, thanks for a great post.  I liked looking at chores from<br/>\nthe other perspective.<br/>\nI had to laugh about cleaning the toilet.  I don&#39;t.  My son does.  He thinks<br/>\nit is fun.  Don&#39;t anybody come to my house and tell him otherwise, either!<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36736,"nextTopicId":36748}}
