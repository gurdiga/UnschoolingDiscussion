Will you <br/>\nbe there? It would be fun to meet you! I enjoyed seeing you and your <br/>\nfamily on your site also. It is nice to put a human face on these <br/>\nposts!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried yesterday to file my R-4 affidavit to set up my private <br/>\nschool (Calif. regulations) so I can leave our charter school but <br/>\nfound the Calif. Dept. of Ed.(CDE) has changed their policy and you <br/>\ncan no longer fill the form out  online as of 1/06/03.  You now have <br/>\nto request the form in writing. I contacted HSC and their legal <br/>\ncommittee told me NOT to call CDE and be very careful with what I say <br/>\nin my request. They (HSC legal) are not happy with the change in <br/>\npolicy and don&#39;t know their motives behind the change. I hear that <br/>\nsome are being denied the application for the R-4.  HSC said to <br/>\ncontact them if I have any problems. They have been very helpful. <br/>\nAlso told me not to say anything to our charter school about leaving <br/>\nuntil our R-4 is in place. I have to meet with our ES tomorrow so I <br/>\nwill really have to bite my tongue!! Anyone out here in Calif. filed <br/>\nan R-4 lately? Any advice you can give me?
