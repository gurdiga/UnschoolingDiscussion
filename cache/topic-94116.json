Honestly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other places online to discuss schools.<br/>\nEspecially &quot;pre-schools.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople leave this list because of the high volume of e-mail, and I&#39;m <br/>\nuncomfortable when the volume isn&#39;t at least about unschooling.   <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople come on for a day or two and leave, too, and I would REALLY hate for <br/>\ntheir day or two to have been a discussion of which pre-school is better.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor unschoolers, there isn&#39;t a good pre-school.  If your circumstances demand <br/>\nthat you put your children in ANY kind of institution, then it might be <br/>\nbetter to go to the pre-school-comparison discussions that I&#39;m sure are happening <br/>\nall over yahoogroups and the web.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93880,"nextTopicId":94020}}
