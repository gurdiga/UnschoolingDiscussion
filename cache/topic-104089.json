I do not play any instruments, just sing. <br/>\nMy 18 yo son plays guitar and writes songs. My 14 yo son has been <br/>\nplaying the drums since he was 11. They both showed interest in music <br/>\nabout 3 to 4 years ago. When the drummer expressed interest in learning <br/>\ndrums, we got him a practice pad and found someone who could show him <br/>\nthe basics. We also checked a really neat book out from the library <br/>\ncalled 100 rock drum rhythms or some such thing. It had an audio CD with <br/>\nit. We talked a lot about what he was learning and that often led to me <br/>\nrecommending different musicians he could listen to, Neal Peart of Rush <br/>\nis one that comes to mind. we found someone who did play that was <br/>\nwilling to spend a little time with him each week. within a year, we had <br/>\nto buy him a drum set for Christmas. The guitarist went through a <br/>\nsimilar pattern. The big thing is they both chose to  practice and apply <br/>\nwhat they were learning and it gave them a good foundation to build  <br/>\nupon.  They now have a band together with another friend who plays bass. <br/>\nAt present they have played 2 shows and a local band has asked if they <br/>\ncan possibly open for them maybe this spring. If your child finds music <br/>\nis what they want to do, there are lots of opportunities to learn, <br/>\nsometimes you just have to get a little creative.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohanna<br/>\n&quot; A man is as free as he chooses to make himself, never an atom freer.&quot; <br/>\nThe Raven, Lillith by George MacDonald<br/>\n***********************************************************************<br/>\nCome to the Northern Regional War Practice, March 5 2005<br/>\nCumberland Mountain State Park, Crossville, TN<br/>\nArmored Combat, Youth Combat, Rapier, and Classes<br/>\nBrought to you by the Shire of Easaraigh<br/>\nwww.easaraigh.org<br/>\n**************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\njenneferh2000 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I&#39;m interested in families&#39; experiences with children learning how to <br/>\n&gt;play musical instruments when the parents themselves do not play.
