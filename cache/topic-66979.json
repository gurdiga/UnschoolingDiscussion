I&#39;ve had plenty of time to pursue my interests but I do <br/>\n  it in <br/>\n  &gt; spurts.  I also clean and do just about everything else in spurts.  <br/>\n  If I <br/>\n  &gt; didn&#39;t plan ahead it would take me 2 hours to get the kids dressed <br/>\n  and ready <br/>\n  &gt; to go.  Instead,I spend about 15 minutes after they head to bed to <br/>\n  find <br/>\n  &gt; everything we will need for the next day.  I HIGHLY recommend <br/>\n  FlyLady to <br/>\n  &gt; help you get organized.  It&#39;s for your home, but somehow it clears <br/>\n  up your <br/>\n  &gt; head, too!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
