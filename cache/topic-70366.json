You did know that was coming right?<br/>\nIt&#39;s the way the children are treated. Like you said, treat them the way you<br/>\nwould want someone to do to you. He&#39;s still old school and sometimes he<br/>\ncomes out witht he idea that &quot;there kids and should listen to me&quot; no matter<br/>\nwhat he says. He&#39;s not real bad and he is getting better. But it&#39;s something<br/>\nwe work on every day. Usually when he handles something in not the best way,<br/>\nI&#39;ll just look at him. He KNOWS I&#39;m looking at him. Probably boring holes in<br/>\nhis head! He&#39;ll turn to me and say, &quot;that wasn&#39;t the best way to handle that<br/>\nwas it?&quot; knowing what my answer is already. Most times he&#39;ll apologize to<br/>\nthe kids and try again, which is always better. I&#39;m trying to get him to<br/>\nread some stuff and he does. I think a lot of it is just the way he was<br/>\nraised. And he knows that wasn&#39;t the best, yet it&#39;s hard for him to get away<br/>\nfrom. At least he&#39;s always open to suggestions.

But after last night maybe not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue I have is not between he and I on the surface but more the 11 yr. <br/>\nold.<br/>\nHe is hard on him I feel.  <br/>\nEach night after dinner my DH reminds the 11yr old about clearing the table <br/>\nand putting the dishes in the dishwasher.  Almost every night there is an <br/>\nissue. Before DH complained it was not done right. I asked him to stop and he did <br/>\nfor the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I was going to go out to B & N to get my book. Dustin and I (the <br/>\n11 yr. old) enjoy doing this together.  Dustin wanted no part of doing the <br/>\ndishes and I actually have been doing it for him when he has had enough. It&#39;s <br/>\nalmost maddening for him, he sings, dances, wines, gets angry.  I think some of it <br/>\nhe inherited from me cuz I too mumble and sing made up songs when I do the <br/>\ndishes also.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, (the shorter version) My DH walked into the kitchen when Dustin <br/>\nannounced he was done for the 3rd time and the floor was soaked.  So DH is <br/>\nbeginning to freak out about the floor being wet so I thought I would tone the <br/>\nsituation down. I squirted milk from the babies bottle at him and he began to tickle <br/>\nme. Well, the 11 yr. old wanting to join in flipped the mop he was using in <br/>\nthe air not knowing it was going to cover DH with dirty water.  (Kinda funny but <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t think so. )<br/>\nDH demanded he go straight to his room and ADDED oh and your NOT going to B & <br/>\nN. <br/>\nI was on the phone during all of this. <br/>\nI got off the phone and said you know not only did you over react but you <br/>\ntook away the one thing he and I where looking forward too all day!!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to me having Dustin doing the dishes is just as much pulling teeth as <br/>\nschoolwork is.  I am thinking I am going to go back to just doing it my self.  <br/>\nI think a big part of this is my DH having control over something.<br/>\n I tell him all the time you are parenting and counting the 123 like it will <br/>\nbe followed by a spanking. You are trying to follow your fathers parenting and <br/>\nyou cant he spanked. One situation is going to take you there and I will NOT <br/>\nhave that in my home.<br/>\nHe knows and tones it done when I remind him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo after I pointed out what I felt was poor statements I asked him &quot;you dont <br/>\nthink you where wrong do you&quot;? Nope, he said.<br/>\nWe ended up not going. Dustin waited for me to put the baby to bed and then <br/>\nsaid he wanted to watch the movie Speed and asked if we could go another night. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease tell me how you all would have handled this, what and I doing wrong? <br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70410,"nextTopicId":70641}}
