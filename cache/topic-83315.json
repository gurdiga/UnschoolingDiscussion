I remember when I was 15 years old and my great uncle (my grandmother&#39;s youngest brother) was moving from California to SC.

It wasn&#39;t until after he left, that our parents officially told us that he was gay, HiV+, and going to live with my grandmother until he died.  My brothers and I had already figured out the gay part and decided that was OK with us.
