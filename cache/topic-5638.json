I am still getting over my anger and grief<br/>\nabout issues from my childhood.  I have trouble being forgiving enough to<br/>\nsay that my parents did what they did out of love and ignorance.  I was 8th<br/>\nchild in my family and you would think they would know better by then.  Not<br/>\nto mention the fact that they underwent fertility tratments to have<br/>\nchildren at a late age (late 30s mom and early 40s dad) with my brother and<br/>\nI, yet they then resented (and told us as much) having children &quot;our age&quot;<br/>\nat their ages.  Sheesh!  Obviously we were trophy children for the marriage<br/>\nand not children wanted from some need to parent.  They were already not<br/>\nparenting the children that they had.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou add to that the fact that my father&#39;s first wife of 18 years (and<br/>\nparent to 4 of my siblings) was a therapist/counselor and my father has a<br/>\nmultiple Master&#39;s degree education.  My mother had some college but was<br/>\ndefinately more ignorant than my father, even though she was the eldest of<br/>\n7 siblings, the youngest of whom were born when she had a child of her own.<br/>\n So she knew about children even before she began to have her own.  My<br/>\nfather had an innate distrust of counselors, therapist, mental health<br/>\nprofessionals, child psychology in general, due to his nasty divorce and<br/>\nrefused to see problems with us or address them as what they were.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll ask you all for your opinion on this (just one small example.)  If you<br/>\nhave a five year old child who was writing &quot;dark&quot; poetry (I was an early<br/>\nliterate) and writing runaway notes, packing a suitcase with blankie and<br/>\nteddy and heading to the yard to sit and cry all day, or going on crying<br/>\njags after school for hours at a time, hiding under the bed to avoid school<br/>\nor feining illness, WHAT would you do?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you completely ignore the behavior?  Would you not even talk to the<br/>\nchild about it?  Would you blame the child and punish them for lying?  How<br/>\ncan a parent be so blind and so egocentric that they do not even see or<br/>\ncare to address a child with that kind of obvious pain and difficulty?  It<br/>\nstill makes me angry and it was just the very beginning.

It&#39;s so neurotic but I&#39;m actually more<br/>\n afraid of telling her than I am of taking the kids out of school.<br/>\n Thanks, &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Nancy --<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thought is that you have tried the ps system and it has not worked for <br/>\nyou.  The way we did it was to do it and then tell Gramma.  (MIL, <br/>\nsurprisingly, and school teacher SIL, were both completely for hsing.)  Not <br/>\nthat she was as upset as your mother seems to be about the hs possibility.  <br/>\nBut she had her very strong doubts.  She rarely (if ever) questions my <br/>\ndecisions about my children, but felt compelled to ask her questions (all the <br/>\nusual ones so I had all the usual answers from this and other lists).  After <br/>\nabout an hour on the phone she was satisfied.  Now she buys them workbooks <br/>\nand regular books and art supplies and she started volunteering in the elem <br/>\nschool I went to as a child and I hear a lot of reports about how awful it is <br/>\n-- she has started buying the teacher supplies, the classes are overcrowded, <br/>\nin this case, the teacher has been forced back to work (in a 1st grade class <br/>\nwith 28 kids) while recovering from a crushed foot and still in a wheelchair. <br/>\n She is not 100% (probably about 99%) convinced but has gotten over her <br/>\ninitial fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say:  inform her after fact, brace yourself, prepare answers for the <br/>\nquestions you know she will have, give her time to get used to the idea, send <br/>\nher lots of good news updates, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you are not obligated to inform anyone (even your mom) about the actual <br/>\nins and outs of your hsing day -- if she is more comfortable thinking of <br/>\nschool at home but you plan to evolve to a more un approach, this might not <br/>\nbe the best time to broach that subject.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you could throw her a bone.  &quot;You know, Mom, we do wish it had worked <br/>\nout at the ps.  We really did try it.  But then X happened and little Wally <br/>\nwas having problems with Y and you know Z has been terrible for him.  But, <br/>\nmaybe sometime in the future, we might consider re-entering the system.  We <br/>\nwant to keep all of our options open.&quot;  You don&#39;t even have to mean it but it <br/>\nmight give her comfort during the transition period.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"metta","from":"metta &lt;metta@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ruaWdA7Dsi662Px5d10EcULrTkjJvlDuTYye0fTAd-UkYB84cKqfwYO0U3uzHnIGsAHSzTfBKfzzzIGIKgqKJWB-Ew","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: outing myself","postDate":"948147309","msgId":5644,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNzMuNTY0NC45NTkyNjk3NDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5642,"nextInTopic":5645,"prevInTime":5643,"nextInTime":5645,"topicId":5638,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We always had  a difficult relationship and my<br/>\nmother has some serious problems, well mainly she&#39;s just downright hillbilly<br/>\nmean, but you could make a case for mitigating circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever you decide to handle her, just know that doing so creates a way for<br/>\nyou to grow and become even more of your own person.
