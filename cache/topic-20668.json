If<br/>\n any are interested... a book called, &quot;What the Bible says about Child<br/>\n Training&quot; is very good about detailing the parents responsibility and<br/>\n explains the &quot;rod&quot;, &quot;chastisement&quot;, &quot;discipline&quot;.  The author of the book is<br/>\n J. Richard Fugate.<br/>\n I recieved spankings as a child.  I do not remember the spankings , but I do<br/>\n remember the negative comments made by authority figures.  The verbal scars<br/>\n wound far deeper than any spanking can.<br/>\n Kate &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   And all other rod writings. The shepard&#39;s rod is used to guide his sheep <br/>\nnot inflict pain. If a shepard hit his sheep w/ a rod they would run off. I <br/>\nlive in the world&#39;s second largest area for sheep herding for their wool <br/>\n(Australia is now #1) I haev watched the herders for 7 years now every spring <br/>\nthru fall. They do not hit the sheep they wave a rod or rope and use the dogs <br/>\nthe guide the sheep for hundreds of miles each year. <br/>\n<br/>\n   This biblical take some have on the rod is fallacy. I believe it was meant <br/>\nas a metaphor for guiding our children kindly and firmly if need be. Not as a <br/>\npermission slip to hit or spank our children. Is this respectful? Our <br/>\nchildren need our love, guidence, redirection, and nurturing  along the way. <br/>\nNot corporal punishment.<br/>\n<br/>\n   For those who do believe in spanking,how do you feel when you spank your <br/>\nchild? Is it a matter of fact thing? Like,ok you my dear son have disobeyed <br/>\nme and it is time for a spanking. Or are you spanking and feeling angry for <br/>\nthe disobedience? Do you feel sad or upset w/ having to spank your child? <br/>\nDisappointed? Or truely feel justified?<br/>\n<br/>\n   Redirection when they are young and explaining dangers when a bit older <br/>\nwork wonderfully. Granted there are times they aren&#39;t going to listen and <br/>\nscar you to death like running for the street. But is spanking them really <br/>\ngoing to fix this? I do not believe so. It teaches children to learn how not <br/>\nto get caught doing wrong things. Creates sneakiness and parent wise kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n   My mother didn&#39;t believe in spanking but when I provoked her to anger she <br/>\ncertainly left mantal scars by words and physical punishment. She left raised <br/>\nred handmarks flicked my face for smart mouthing,kicked the shit out of me <br/>\nfor running away and sneaking out w/ boys. She took away priviledges and TV <br/>\nor grounded me. What did it accomplish? I learned how to sneak around even <br/>\nbetter,I also became a people pleaser. Even to this day I fight this <br/>\ntendancy. I find myself cleaning the house like a mad woman when dh and I <br/>\nfight b/c I know he likes a clean house. Normally I would say oh well <br/>\ntomorrow I may clean if I have time and he would be fine w/ it also. But my <br/>\nfear of not pleasing the one I love makes me kick into child mode. I also <br/>\nhave a difficult time expressing myself esp. w/ someone whose presence is <br/>\ndominant. Actually I am having difficulty right now writing this,afraid to <br/>\nspeak my mind. But spanking a child is NOT ok w/ me. I struggle w/ my anger <br/>\nevery day and I feel my mother coming out of me on occaision. I am learning <br/>\nto shut my mouth and take a time out. Spanking out of anger or out of duty is <br/>\nnever ok in my NSHO.Screaming at a child isn&#39;t either or saying nasty <br/>\nthings,these are all akin to me. So yes I am scarred from my childhood. But I <br/>\nam working on it and trying not to blame my mother too much. She was abused <br/>\nas a child verbally and physically and it got passed down. I intend to stop <br/>\nit at this generation so my grandchildren won&#39;t be on the recieving end some <br/>\nday.Treat others as you wish to be treated.<br/>\n<br/>\n   NICKI~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20614,"nextTopicId":20670}}
