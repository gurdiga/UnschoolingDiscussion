What I&#39;m<br/>\nstruggling with right now is how our house is set up. When the TV is<br/>\non, it dominates the acoustic space.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat means that the kids who do have to study (I have one part time<br/>\nenrolled in high school and another who has chosen to follow The Well<br/>\nTrained Mind program of his own accord and a third in college part<br/>\ntime) and me (who is in grad school) don&#39;t have the quiet necessary to<br/>\nfocus. It doesn&#39;t help to leave the room. The entire downstairs can<br/>\nhear the TV. The primary place to study is the kitchen table or the<br/>\nliving room. Our kids&#39; bedrooms don&#39;t have space for desks since they<br/>\nare doubled up with beds and dressers (the bedrooms are tiny).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is happening is that there is conflict over TV - turning it<br/>\noff, when it can be on and so on. The X box is not a problem since<br/>\nthere is no laugh track of talking. But TV? It&#39;s on a lot and it&#39;s<br/>\nvery distracting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we have the difficulty of schedules. Some kids need TV as downtime<br/>\nafter school while the other is just getting ready to sit down to study.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas I&#39;m not thinking of for making TV not a source of tension<br/>\nand not so dominating?<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108662,"nextTopicId":108607}}
