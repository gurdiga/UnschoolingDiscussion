With TV we have to pick and<br/>\nchoose after the full range of choices comes into our homes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s perfectly legitimate to not like visual media if you don&#39;t learn<br/>\nvisually. Just as it&#39;s perfectly legitimate to not like books if someone<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like to read. (Naturally doesn&#39;t like to read. Not doesn&#39;t like to<br/>\nread because of bad experiences in school.)

I don&#39;t regret it for a minute!  I had already started <br/>\nletting my daughter (just turned 6yo) watch more than I had before <br/>\nwhen I started reading on this group.  So I may have been one step <br/>\nahead of you, but you are definitely going in a great direction.  <br/>\nYes, my daughter watches quite a bit of tv, but I am amazed at how it <br/>\ngets her juices flowing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHer mind is SO much MORE active all the time now.  She even tells me <br/>\nabout how she would have had the story end, or how she would have <br/>\nacted in a certain situation.  Yesterday as I was sitting on the <br/>\ncouch and she was watching tv, one of the characters wrote a note <br/>\nthat had PS- at the end of it.  She asked me what that meant.  After <br/>\nI explained it to her, I wondered when that gets introduced to <br/>\nschooled children.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust little stuff like that all the time.  I love the <br/>\nquestion about what Steven Spielburg would have become if his mom had <br/>\nlimited his tv viewing.  Or Bill Gates with the computer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway, just another vote in the &quot;To TV&quot; direction.  Take the <br/>\nplunge!  The water&#39;s great!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99851478,"authorName":"Shari","from":"&quot;Shari&quot; &lt;teach2kids2002@...&gt;","profile":"teach2kids2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: to TV or not to TV","postDate":"1053105489","msgId":69400,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJhMzZnaCs1b3VqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwY2UwMWMzMWJiZCQ0MjhlNTk2MCQyZTFjMzJkMkBtYXJrPg=="},"prevInTopic":69373,"nextInTopic":69412,"prevInTime":69399,"nextInTime":69401,"topicId":69373,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
