A local Drs wife came in to pick up some RXs.  She was talking to me <br/>\nabout having a new baby.  The pharmacist ( a lady) said, Mrs, Riley, you have <br/>\n4 children, how did you manage, maybe you have some advice.   Mrs Riley <br/>\nshrugged and said, &quot;One child takes up all your time, its not like you have <br/>\nmore time with fewer children&quot;  I have never forgotten that comment.  And its <br/>\nsooo true.  Thats why parents with fewer children can not understand how <br/>\nlarger families manage.  Because thier one ( or two) children take up all of <br/>\nthier time, they cant imagine having more because they would have no time for <br/>\nthem.  They dont understand that you just fit all of your children in the <br/>\nsame time, and you find more creative ways to manage your time.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother wise comment I have never forgotten was made by my Grandma, a mother <br/>\nof 7.   She said a lot of folks would ask how they managed financially with <br/>\nsuch a large family, it must be awful to have to feed that many children.  <br/>\nGrandma observed that in her chicken pen, the hen with one or two chicks was <br/>\n&quot;scratching just as hard&quot; for food as the hen with a dozen chicks.    <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\nWho is glad there IS some wisdom out there<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52825,"nextTopicId":52821}}
