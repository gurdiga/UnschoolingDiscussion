Are children going to have an interest in the<br/>\nhuman body and in sex itself, absolutely.  But it is<br/>\nour place to explain the beauty of it. To me having<br/>\npornography in the home in whatever form is providing<br/>\nan unsafe enviornment for a child and even an adult. <br/>\nMy son has told us that he does not want the password<br/>\nto the internet for fear of getting in a pornographic<br/>\nwebsite even accidently.
