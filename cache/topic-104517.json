I have a 20 year old son who remembers<br/>\nhis high school days fondly. He attended a local fine<br/>\narts charter school and did spendidly. He got good<br/>\ngrades and was known as a very talented writer. Now,<br/>\nas a college sophmore at a Big Ten campus he is<br/>\nstruggling to find his niche.<br/>\nMy 17 year old daughter simply shines at high school.<br/>\nShe gets good grades, has tons of friends, does<br/>\nsports, band, gets awards on a regular basis, the<br/>\nwhole nine yards. On the whole, she is a good sister<br/>\nto AnnaClaire. It is a sore point for her that she has<br/>\nto work so hard [i.e. staying up late nights in order<br/>\nto &quot;cram&quot;], while her sister doesn&#39;t.<br/>\nThe biggest problem is my husband. As the son of a<br/>\nformer school teacher and college professor, he has<br/>\nsome heavy duty philosophical problems with this whole<br/>\nUnschooling concept. He agrees with homeschooling, but<br/>\nwould be a whole lot happier if she spent her time<br/>\nwriting papers, learning Latin,etc He is also<br/>\nstruggling with some health issues [diabetes,<br/>\ndepression, high blood pressure] and not always a<br/>\npatient man. The truth is that the my beloved husband<br/>\nand youngest child get on each other&#39;s nerves. He gets<br/>\nto spend less time alone with me because she is always<br/>\naround which is a sore spot. He is concerned that she<br/>\n&quot;always gets her own way&quot;. His older brother had some<br/>\nserious problems with mental illness and kind of ran<br/>\nthe family because everyone tiptoed around the guy. My<br/>\nolder sister had some very heavy duty mental health<br/>\nproblems and died as the result of suicide-her illness<br/>\nmay have contributed to my folks breaking up.He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want AnnaClaire to come betwen the two us. I&#39;m<br/>\nsorry to be so long winded-it&#39;s just that families are<br/>\ncomplicated and both mental illness and homeschooling<br/>\nforce people to think long and hard about priorites.<br/>\nI think maybe I&#39;d better get back to lurking...<br/>\nThanks again for your thoughts!<br/>\nCharisse         <br/>\n--- Elizabeth Hill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ecsamhill@...\">ecsamhill@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; **My 2 older kids and my husband see AnnaClaire as<br/>\n&gt; spoilt rotten. **<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can you do some extra-nice things for them<br/>\n&gt; occasionally, even if they don&#39;t live at home any<br/>\n&gt; more?
