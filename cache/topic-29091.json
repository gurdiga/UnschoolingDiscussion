(There&#39;s plenty of natural chemicals that are<br/>\n&gt;poisonous too.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just as &#39;unschooling&#39; wasn&#39;t even conceived of at some point in society <br/>\n(with the exception of a few) its hard to imagine that genetically <br/>\ndifferent chemistry can&#39;t be altered.<br/>\nFinding available information on people like Dr. Schimmel(Vegatest before <br/>\nOccidental Institute bought out his Vegatest and altered its purpose) and <br/>\nother such modern day pioneers, is as difficult as it was to find a book <br/>\non today as the Family Bed was 75 years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe, I&#39;m just a person. I haven&#39;t done anything that alters the future of <br/>\neducation or of medicine. BUT I have been lucky enough to have met many <br/>\nwho have, simply by being related to one of the pioneers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe toxic information that sits on the RNA/DNA can be altered. Can be <br/>\nrepaired. Or rather it can be given what it needs to repair itself. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat information is on there for many reasons. And like I said in the <br/>\npast we simply cannot just eat right anymore to balance our bodies. We as <br/>\na planet have become too many generations of such toxicitys to do that <br/>\nanymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a few books that best explained it in english. I lent them out <br/>\n(of course) and haven&#39;t been able to track them down, even on the <br/>\ninternet. One of them called &#39;Hidden Killers&#39; about the low level virii <br/>\nthat is the root of a good number of neurological disorders and disease. <br/>\nThe other explained the non-invasive medicine that would hopefully be the <br/>\nfuture &#39;21st Century Medicine&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill the truth of how the body can cure itself, when given what it needs <br/>\non a cellular level ever surface to mainstream? It all depends on how our <br/>\nfuture unfolds in regards to corporate ownership of the earth and its <br/>\ninhabitants.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;In fact it&#39;s because biology isn&#39;t perfect that we&#39;re here at all. It&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt;small chance genetic changes -- many neutral, many bad, a few good -- that<br/>\n&gt;allow a species to exploit the environment in new ways. The bad changes die<br/>\n&gt;off and the good gain an advantage in reproduction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s possible in a more &quot;natural&quot; society, many of the people who have<br/>\n&gt;problems adapting to modern society would thrive. It&#39;s possible that many of<br/>\n&gt;the people who adapt very well to modern society would be ill suited and<br/>\n&gt;considered crazy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you are saying in the above. I think its a situation <br/>\nwhere so much of what I&#39;ve learned and seen cannot be summed up in just a <br/>\nfew sentences.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, of course, it goes against the core of what we all learned as far as <br/>\nMedicine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut after seeing people walk who were doomed to death, after seeing small <br/>\nmiracles like &#39;slow&#39; children show light and laughter for the first time, <br/>\nI&#39;m barely scraping the surface of the neurological advances here... <br/>\nafter seeing it, I can beleive it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI AM NOT AN EXPERT on this. Hence my feeble attempts at trying to explain <br/>\na science that just might be our future. I say might because it goes <br/>\nagainst everything that is already in place. And what we would do with <br/>\nall those people in the medical field (non-emergency) if they became <br/>\nobsolete overnight. I&#39;m a cynic when it comes to fighting the AMA, the <br/>\nCDC or the big pharmaceutical companys.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you explain to a person who had gone to school for 12 years that <br/>\nMOST, not all, of what they learned was wrong? How do you tell them that <br/>\nunseen influences matter? Something that can&#39;t be studied under a <br/>\nmicroscope actually exists? Making a book such as &#39;The Dancing WuLi <br/>\nMasters, a laymans guide to quantum physics&#39; required reading ISN&#39;T going <br/>\nto happen anytime soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that thinking outside the norm like pioneers before us in <br/>\nother fields, can hopefully allow those that do engage in this research <br/>\nto continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, None of this research is done stateside. None of the people I <br/>\nmentioned were treated stateside.

With regard to academics, I believe that <br/>\n&gt; unschooling is all about accepting people for exactly what they are and<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; not try to change them to fit some kind of norm that society has <br/>\n&gt; created.  So, therefore, IMHO, within the lifestyle of unschooling,  <br/>\n&gt; problems with academics don&#39;t exist.   Who is to determine what is a <br/>\n&gt; problem and what is not a problem anyway?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mimi<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29206,"nextTopicId":29185}}
