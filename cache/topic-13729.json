It<br/>\nwas, as usual, wonderful.  Many participants AND festival goers dress up,<br/>\nboth adults & children.  Sometimes you see entire families in costume, other<br/>\ntimes just the kids or just the adults.  My kids wore their cloaks and my<br/>\nson took his sword & belt.  As it is still quite warm here in the south,<br/>\nthey shed those extras before lunch!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the only Ren fair we&#39;ve been to, there are LOTS of shows, elephant &<br/>\ncamel rides, lots of kid&#39;s activities like bows & arrows, candle making,<br/>\nplay areas, paintball, walk thru maze, a ride which simulates jousting,<br/>\nother rides which are pushed (not electric).  There are lots of performances<br/>\nin the &quot;mall&quot; like dancing, juggling, photo opportunities, musical<br/>\nperformances, etc.  There are 3 jousts each day.  I cannot recommend it<br/>\nenough, WE LOVE IT.  Once word of warning, it can be expensive.  Some things<br/>\nlike the shows and the joust are free.  Most of the things the kids want to<br/>\ndo are $2-$5 each, which can add up.  The food is great, a bit pricey, and<br/>\nusually a long line to wait in.  But all worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!<br/>\nCindy in VA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13713,"nextTopicId":13728}}
