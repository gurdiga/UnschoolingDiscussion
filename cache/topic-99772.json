He decided to <br/>\nenroll her (age four) in Catholic preschool this fall, because she <br/>\nwasn&#39;t getting near enough peer group interaction in the comfort of <br/>\nher nanny&#39;s home or while attending the weekly playgroup -- you <br/>\nknow, the one where Bobby got kicked out for biting his playmates <br/>\nlast year at age three (you assess that one!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast week, she brought her dollie over and suggested a game <br/>\nwhere &quot;Tommy&quot; was dead, and the kids should assist in burying him so <br/>\nhe would go to the deadworld.  We don&#39;t even get into Halloween <br/>\nanymore around here, so someone suggested they play TAG instead.  I <br/>\nwon&#39;t play psychologist, but her dad had just been reprimanded by <br/>\nher mom (who had left as soon as he joined us, immediately prior to <br/>\nthis scenario) not to leave her alone in the street.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI get the distinct impression from comments he&#39;s made here and there <br/>\nthat he thinks that we&#39;re not quite up to snuff in the parenting <br/>\ndepartment, but I suppose anybody will do if he has more important <br/>\nthings on his agenda than spend a few minutes socializing with his <br/>\nown child or her friends.  I had previously informed him that over <br/>\nthe years I have established an understanding with my neighbors that <br/>\nstay-at-home moms don&#39;t mean free sitting services 24/7, unless <br/>\nthere&#39;s a genuine need.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople see a woman with eight kids and seem to think, what&#39;s one or <br/>\ntwo more till the whole neighborhood&#39;s running around in my <br/>\nbackyard -- even when my crew has come in for the day (and often <br/>\ndisappeared on purpose because of the obnoxious ways the other kids <br/>\nacted when they showed up after school!)  I finally got the idea to <br/>\ntell each one in turn to bring a parent with them from now on so we <br/>\ncould all experience the benefits of socialization!  Not <br/>\nsurprisingly, no one wanted to play that game with us...
