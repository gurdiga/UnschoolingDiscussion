But I don&#39;t think that is the issue.  I<br/>\nthink the issue is who decides when it has become malignant?  How is that<br/>\ndecision arrived at?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a very sensitive 10yo dd.  &quot;Matlock&quot; scares her.  When something is<br/>\ncoming on that I think might cause her problems, I say &quot;This program is<br/>\nabout such and such.  It might be too scary for you.&quot;  Then she decides if<br/>\nshe wants to watch it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe went through several months of sitting on her behind watching television<br/>\nreruns all day.  She was crabby and tired all the time.  I pointed out that<br/>\nI thought she would feel better if she got her blood flowing, got outside.<br/>\nSHE decided that she would give it a try and SHE decided that she agreed<br/>\nwith me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas television viewing benign in those situations?  No.  But Adriane was<br/>\nable to found that out for herself and I feel that I have to trust her to<br/>\nfind those things out.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther times, I have been dead wrong with my suggestions.  We have fire ants<br/>\nhere and little kids just love to stir the mounds and watch the ants<br/>\nscatter.  Marsie, then 3yo, loved messing with the ants.  I told her to be<br/>\ncareful how she played because when the ants bite it really hurts and might<br/>\nmake her cry.  She blew me off and has spent the 2 years since then happily<br/>\npicking up fire ants and letting them crawl all over her without ever<br/>\ngetting bit.  We call it &quot;the force&quot; (It is either that or the ants can tell<br/>\nshe&#39;s gonna taste bad).  She has learned a tremendous amount about insects<br/>\nand trusting her own decisions.  She would not have learned either if I was<br/>\na &quot;good&quot; mom and kept her out of the ant piles.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28074,"nextTopicId":28071}}
