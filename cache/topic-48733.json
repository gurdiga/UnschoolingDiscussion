It is often described as &quot;just living life&quot; and &quot;trusting that kids <br/>\nwill learn,&quot; and that is exactly what it feels like to long-time <br/>\nunschoolers. But there is more to it, I think -- an attitude and a basic <br/>\nprinciple.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe attitude is that the impulse to learn is a built-in natural automatic <br/>\ninstrinsic part of human nature that teachers and schools and, <br/>\nunfortunately, parents often interfere with but which can, instead, be <br/>\ngently and calmly protected and nurtured by enlightened parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic principle is that kids don&#39;t have to be taught or bribed or <br/>\nthreatened to get them to learn, but that they need to be supported and <br/>\nengaged and facilitated and helped to learn what they want to learn when <br/>\nthey want to learn it and how they want to learn it. A corollary is that <br/>\neverything counts - you can facilitate learning in any direction they want <br/>\nto go, learning anything and everything in any way, and one thing leads to <br/>\nanother and over years of living a life filled with that kind of support, <br/>\nthey will learn what they need to learn to live the life they want to live.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48749,"nextTopicId":48755}}
