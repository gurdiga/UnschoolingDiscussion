We&#39;re vegetarians for \n  many different reasons. I guess the<br>first and foremost would be for the \n  earth&#39;s sake. The amount of water,<br>energy, chemicals, land abuse, etc. \n  needed to sustain production of meat<br>animals is horrific on the \n  environment. Secondly would be health reasons, we<br>eat organic produce or \n  stuff we grow ourselves, I don&#39;t want to be putting<br>meat into our bodies \n  that has hormones, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. in it,<br>and also I feel \n  that meat doesn&#39;t feel &quot;right&quot; to my body on a cellular<br>level (I&#39;ve been a \n  veggie for going on 20 years now, it was when I started<br>exercising and came \n  to a better awareness of my body that I first felt how<br>wrong it felt for my \n  own body to eat meat). Thirdly would be animal-loving<br>reasons as the way \n  most meat animals are raised and slaughtered is pretty<br>inhumane. But I&#39;m \n  not totally against eating meat for this reason - if it<br>was like my \n  ancestors where it was myself, a deer , and an arrow, I&#39;d most<br>likely shoot \n  the deer. After all, the mountain lion would be doing the same<br>thing, \n  nature is in itself fairly cruel to animals across the board. But<br>modern \n  methods go above and beyond in the cruelty department and so I don&#39;t<br>like \n  to support them.<br><br>That brings us to the aquarium. This is an issue I&#39;ve \n  gone back and forth on<br>for many years. Do I go to zoos, circuses, wild \n  animal parks, or not? On one<br>hand, they are keeping animals in cages which \n  feels wrong to me. On the<br>other hand, zoos, aquariums, etc. have come a \n  long way since the day of the<br>bear in the concrete cage staring out through \n  the bars. Nowadays most zoos<br>are into wildlife research, reproduction, \n  animal-trading with other zoos to<br>breed species whose decline in the wild \n  is bordering on extinction, etc. And<br>they also play a big role in educating \n  the public about the dangers to our<br>earth&#39;s wild areas. So does the good \n  they do balance out the bad? Or does<br>the bad of keeping wild animals caged \n  outweigh the good of perhaps saving<br>the whole species? Would panda bears be \n  extinct now if people didn&#39;t see how<br>magical they are up close and \n  therefore send money, time, and energy to<br>organizations to keep their \n  remaining habitat safe? The Oregon Coast<br>Aquarium, where we went, has some \n  measure of fame because of their efforts<br>to rehabilitate Keiko (the orca \n  from &quot;Free Willy&quot;) and return him to the<br>wild. Is supporting this a good \n  thing? Right now, we do go to the aquarium,<br>and to the zoo. We don&#39;t go to \n  the circus because I feel that it doesn&#39;t<br>have any redeeming qualities, the \n  animals are only there for entertainment<br>and no research or educational \n  benefit is present.<br><br>A long-winded reply to a question that for me \n  doesn&#39;t have an absolute<br>answer.<br><br>Blue Skies!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  -Robin-<br>Mom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;I told you I was going to grow up to be \n  a<br>weirdo&quot;<br>and Asa (10/5/99) Who says &quot;Fishy swim!&quot; at the aquarium, her \n  favorite place<br>in the world<br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  Flying Clevenger Family<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Message \n  boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br>Check it all out at: \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br><br>Addresses:<br>Post \n  message: Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com<br>Unsubscribe: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br>List owner: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com<br>List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!

My TV is on all the time and my<br/>\n&gt; kids would rather do just<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;about anything else.  During the summer they<br/>\n&gt; rarely watch because we are<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;outside so much.  When I suggest an activity they<br/>\n&gt; show NO hesitation to<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;leave<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;the TV.  Even when it&#39;s on they are usually doing<br/>\n&gt; something else.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Hmmmm, I&#39;d have to say I respectfully disagree<br/>\n&gt; with this one. Unschooling to<br/>\n&gt;   me means child-led learning, it does not mean that<br/>\n&gt; I give my kids free reign<br/>\n&gt;   to do whatever they want whenever they want to.<br/>\n&gt; There are things in life<br/>\n&gt;   that we limit, because of our own principles. For<br/>\n&gt; instance, in our family<br/>\n&gt;   we&#39;re vegetarians, we boycott all Nestle products,<br/>\n&gt; we don&#39;t allow toy guns<br/>\n&gt;   in our house, we ride our bicycles instead of<br/>\n&gt; taking our car, we buy almost<br/>\n&gt;   everything second-hand, and we don&#39;t watch TV. All<br/>\n&gt; of these things, we<br/>\n&gt;   believe are for the overall health and well-being<br/>\n&gt; of our family and/or for<br/>\n&gt;   the health and well-being of our earth.and other<br/>\n&gt; people. Are we not<br/>\n&gt;   unschooling because we&#39;re vegetarian?? Not<br/>\n&gt; unschooling because we won&#39;t buy<br/>\n&gt;   our son a mini replica Uzi? Not unschooling<br/>\n&gt; because we don&#39;t watch the<br/>\n&gt;   television? Not unschooling because our kids have<br/>\n&gt; to bicycle instead of<br/>\n&gt;   riding in the car? To me, unschooling is not a<br/>\n&gt; list of things we do or do<br/>\n&gt;   not do, it&#39;s a mind-set that allows my children to<br/>\n&gt; learn by following their<br/>\n&gt;   own interests instead of being told what to learn,<br/>\n&gt; when, and where. I<br/>\n&gt;   *don&#39;t* believe that means I have to allow them<br/>\n&gt; access to every single way<br/>\n&gt;   to learn things. Sure, they could learn anatomy<br/>\n&gt; and human sexuality by<br/>\n&gt;   watching porn movies. They could learn about<br/>\n&gt; hurricanes by watching TV.<br/>\n&gt;   Both, *I personally* believe are damaging. And why<br/>\n&gt; do I think TV is<br/>\n&gt;   damaging? Because young children don&#39;t have the<br/>\n&gt; mental context to place the<br/>\n&gt;   images they see in. Sure, my son might be watching<br/>\n&gt; a show about hurricanes,<br/>\n&gt;   but he will also see commercials where it is<br/>\n&gt; implied that you need this,<br/>\n&gt;   that, or the other product in order to be happy in<br/>\n&gt; life. He will see ads for<br/>\n&gt;   things that we are not going to buy (for frugality<br/>\n&gt; and earth-saving reasons)<br/>\n&gt;   and that until that point he didn&#39;t know existed<br/>\n&gt; (thus making his life and<br/>\n&gt;   ours so much happier, not to know about all the<br/>\n&gt; things you can&#39;t have :-).<br/>\n&gt;   He will also see ads for other programs with guns<br/>\n&gt; blazing or scantily clad<br/>\n&gt;   people pawing each other. At some point in his<br/>\n&gt; life, he&#39;ll be able to put<br/>\n&gt;   these images in a context, but it&#39;s pretty clear<br/>\n&gt; that right now all they do<br/>\n&gt;   is cause him concern, judging by the way he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; reacted when he&#39;s seen them.<br/>\n&gt;   He&#39;s an extraordinarily sensitive child and I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; like to see him keep his<br/>\n&gt;   &quot;magic&quot; for a few more years.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I also think it&#39;s dangerous to generalize from<br/>\n&gt; one&#39;s own personal<br/>\n&gt;   experiences to every other person. I hear people<br/>\n&gt; say &quot;We have candy out all<br/>\n&gt;   the time and my kids never touch it&quot;, or &quot;we have<br/>\n&gt; the TV on all the time and<br/>\n&gt;   my kids rarely watch it&quot;. Well this is great, and<br/>\n&gt; it may work quite well for<br/>\n&gt;   those individual families. I also know families<br/>\n&gt; that have candy out all the<br/>\n&gt;   time and their kids are 40 pounds overweight. And<br/>\n&gt; I know families<br/>\n&gt;   that have the TV on all the time and the kids are<br/>\n&gt; glued to it like<br/>\n&gt;   little sponges for 7 hours a day. So much depends<br/>\n&gt; on individual kids and the<br/>\n&gt;   preferences and innate personalities they were<br/>\n&gt; born with, as well as the<br/>\n&gt;   family environment. All of this &quot;it&#39;s unschooling<br/>\n&gt; to do this&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt;   unschooling if you do that&quot;, &quot;some people CALL<br/>\n&gt; themselves unschoolers but<br/>\n&gt;   they&#39;re really not&quot;, etc. (not just responding to<br/>\n&gt; this particular post but<br/>\n&gt;   to many in the same vein) remind me of my high<br/>\n&gt; school punk rock days. It was<br/>\n&gt;   &quot;punk&quot; to do this, but &quot;poser&quot; to do that. I could<br/>\n&gt; never keep it all<br/>\n&gt;   straight and I still can&#39;t. If I wasn&#39;t &quot;punk&quot;<br/>\n&gt; because I wore Birkenstocks<br/>\n&gt;   with my mohawk, and I&#39;m not &quot;unschooling&quot; because<br/>\n&gt; I limit TV, well so be it<br/>\n&gt;   I guess :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Blue Skies!<br/>\n&gt;      -Robin-<br/>\n&gt;   Mom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;I told you I was going<br/>\n&gt; to grow up to be a<br/>\n&gt;   weirdo&quot;<br/>\n&gt;   and Asa (10/5/99) Who says &quot;Fishy swim!&quot; at the<br/>\n&gt; aquarium, her favorite place<br/>\n&gt;   in the world<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying<br/>\n&gt; Clevenger Family<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!

We&#39;re vegetarians for many different reasons. I guess the<br/>\nfirst and foremost would be for the earth&#39;s sake. The amount of water,<br/>\nenergy, chemicals, land abuse, etc. needed to sustain production of meat<br/>\nanimals is horrific on the environment. Secondly would be health reasons, we<br/>\neat organic produce or stuff we grow ourselves, I don&#39;t want to be putting<br/>\nmeat into our bodies that has hormones, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. in it,<br/>\nand also I feel that meat doesn&#39;t feel &quot;right&quot; to my body on a cellular<br/>\nlevel (I&#39;ve been a veggie for going on 20 years now, it was when I started<br/>\nexercising and came to a better awareness of my body that I first felt how<br/>\nwrong it felt for my own body to eat meat). Thirdly would be animal-loving<br/>\nreasons as the way most meat animals are raised and slaughtered is pretty<br/>\ninhumane. But I&#39;m not totally against eating meat for this reason - if it<br/>\nwas like my ancestors where it was myself, a deer , and an arrow, I&#39;d most<br/>\nlikely shoot the deer. After all, the mountain lion would be doing the same<br/>\nthing, nature is in itself fairly cruel to animals across the board. But<br/>\nmodern methods go above and beyond in the cruelty department and so I don&#39;t<br/>\nlike to support them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat brings us to the aquarium. This is an issue I&#39;ve gone back and forth on<br/>\nfor many years. Do I go to zoos, circuses, wild animal parks, or not? On one<br/>\nhand, they are keeping animals in cages which feels wrong to me. On the<br/>\nother hand, zoos, aquariums, etc. have come a long way since the day of the<br/>\nbear in the concrete cage staring out through the bars. Nowadays most zoos<br/>\nare into wildlife research, reproduction, animal-trading with other zoos to<br/>\nbreed species whose decline in the wild is bordering on extinction, etc. And<br/>\nthey also play a big role in educating the public about the dangers to our<br/>\nearth&#39;s wild areas. So does the good they do balance out the bad? Or does<br/>\nthe bad of keeping wild animals caged outweigh the good of perhaps saving<br/>\nthe whole species? Would panda bears be extinct now if people didn&#39;t see how<br/>\nmagical they are up close and therefore send money, time, and energy to<br/>\norganizations to keep their remaining habitat safe? The Oregon Coast<br/>\nAquarium, where we went, has some measure of fame because of their efforts<br/>\nto rehabilitate Keiko (the orca from &quot;Free Willy&quot;) and return him to the<br/>\nwild. Is supporting this a good thing? Right now, we do go to the aquarium,<br/>\nand to the zoo. We don&#39;t go to the circus because I feel that it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhave any redeeming qualities, the animals are only there for entertainment<br/>\nand no research or educational benefit is present.<br/>\n<br/>\nA long-winded reply to a question that for me doesn&#39;t have an absolute<br/>\nanswer.<br/>\n<br/>\n Blue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;I told you I was going to grow up to be a<br/>\nweirdo&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) Who says &quot;Fishy swim!&quot; at the aquarium, her favorite place<br/>\nin the world<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"jamces3@aol.com","from":"jamces3@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"jqlQGGxotnWregqfOX27x-BjnrfjUEw2MFCLb0rM6rPu77u2-U7fK_NLiVJRPofoTkyx-J1D","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: another tv question","postDate":"985929037","msgId":17484,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ5LjEyNTRiNmY5LjI3ZjU2ZjRkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17454,"nextInTopic":17490,"prevInTime":17483,"nextInTime":17485,"topicId":17345,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/29/01 3:45:57 PM !!!First Boot!!!, diamondair@email.msn.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1974531693\">In a message dated 3/29/01 3:45:57 PM !!!First Boot!!!, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:diamondair@...\">diamondair@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Unschooling to<br/>\n me means child-led learning, it does not mean that I give my kids free reign<br/>\n to do whatever they want whenever they want to.

To me, unschooling is not a list of things we do or \n  do<br>not do, it&#39;s a mind-set that allows my children to learn by following \n  their<br>own interests instead of being told what to learn, when, and where. \n  I<br>*don&#39;t* believe that means I have to allow them access to every single \n  way<br>to learn things. Sure, they could learn anatomy and human sexuality \n  by<br>watching porn movies. They could learn about hurricanes by watching \n  TV.<br>Both, *I personally* believe are damaging. And why do I think TV \n  is<br>damaging? Because young children don&#39;t have the mental context to place \n  the<br>images they see in. Sure, my son might be watching a show about \n  hurricanes,<br>but he will also see commercials where it is implied that you \n  need this,<br>that, or the other product in order to be happy in life. He will \n  see ads for<br>things that we are not going to buy (for frugality and \n  earth-saving reasons)<br>and that until that point he didn&#39;t know existed \n  (thus making his life and<br>ours so much happier, not to know about all the \n  things you can&#39;t have :-).<br>He will also see ads for other programs with \n  guns blazing or scantily clad<br>people pawing each other. At some point in \n  his life, he&#39;ll be able to put<br>these images in a context, but it&#39;s pretty \n  clear that right now all they do<br>is cause him concern, judging by the way \n  he&#39;s reacted when he&#39;s seen them.<br>He&#39;s an extraordinarily sensitive child \n  and I&#39;d like to see him keep his<br>&quot;magic&quot; for a few more years.<br><br>I \n  also think it&#39;s dangerous to generalize from one&#39;s own personal<br>experiences \n  to every other person. I hear people say &quot;We have candy out all<br>the time \n  and my kids never touch it&quot;, or &quot;we have the TV on all the time and<br>my kids \n  rarely watch it&quot;. Well this is great, and it may work quite well for<br>those \n  individual families. I also know families that have candy out all the<br>time \n  and their kids are 40 pounds overweight. And I know families<br>that have the \n  TV on all the time and the kids are glued to it like<br>little sponges for 7 \n  hours a day. So much depends on individual kids and the<br>preferences and \n  innate personalities they were born with, as well as the<br>family \n  environment. All of this &quot;it&#39;s unschooling to do this&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s \n  not<br>unschooling if you do that&quot;, &quot;some people CALL themselves unschoolers \n  but<br>they&#39;re really not&quot;, etc. (not just responding to this particular post \n  but<br>to many in the same vein) remind me of my high school punk rock days. \n  It was<br>&quot;punk&quot; to do this, but &quot;poser&quot; to do that. I could never keep it \n  all<br>straight and I still can&#39;t. If I wasn&#39;t &quot;punk&quot; because I wore \n  Birkenstocks<br>with my mohawk, and I&#39;m not &quot;unschooling&quot; because I limit TV, \n  well so be it<br>I guess :-)<br><br>Blue Skies!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; -Robin-<br>Mom \n  to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;I told you I was going to grow up to be \n  a<br>weirdo&quot;<br>and Asa (10/5/99) Who says &quot;Fishy swim!&quot; at the aquarium, her \n  favorite place<br>in the world<br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  Flying Clevenger Family<br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Message \n  boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br>Check it all out at: \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br><br>Addresses:<br>Post \n  message: Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com<br>Unsubscribe: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br>List owner: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com<br>List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!

I don&#39;t turn off the tv if they change their minds, or try<br/>\nto convince them to watch the amount of tv I think they &quot;should&quot; watch.
