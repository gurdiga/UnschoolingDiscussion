There was a stream running <br/>\nthrough the playground, and we just had a perfect day.  We played at <br/>\nthe playground, played in the water, took pictures of the swans, and <br/>\nfollowed the stream into a wooded area where it emptied into a big <br/>\nriver.  My kids were just fascinated by the day.  They asked which <br/>\nriver that was, and I wasn&#39;t sure if it was the Susquehanna or the <br/>\nSchuylkill, so I went home and looked it up and told them.  That&#39;s <br/>\nall they really wanted.  To know the name of the river, and to have <br/>\nthe memory of a really fun, full day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I didn&#39;t stop there. ;)  I talked to them about every place on <br/>\nthe Susquehanna river we&#39;d ever seen, and then ordered a map of the <br/>\nchesapeake bay watershed.  I planned a trip to the lake where the <br/>\nriver started, several spots along the river, and then to Maryland <br/>\nwhere the river empties into the ocean.  I got stickers so we could <br/>\nput a sticker on the map of every place we visited.  I got a few <br/>\nbooks, one about salmon, one Minn of the Mississippi I think it was <br/>\ncalled...I was on a roll &lt;grin&gt;  I thought for SURE they&#39;d like all <br/>\nthis since they had such a good day and were so interested in the <br/>\nriver we visited.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo one day I was talking to the kids about plans for the NY trip, and <br/>\ndd said to me ever so gently, &quot;Ummm...Mom?  Do you know that you&#39;re <br/>\nthe only one interested in any of these trips?&quot;  roflol  I&#39;m glad she <br/>\nburst my bubble before I dragged them all around the east coast. ;)  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think when it comes to knowing how much to strew, it&#39;s important to <br/>\nlisten to and trust your maternal instinct.  Learn to recognize the <br/>\ndifference between your maternal instinct and the school voices in <br/>\nyour head.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Where do you store art supplies (or science kits or<br/>\n&gt; whatever) so they are easy to reach (but not for a<br/>\n&gt; toddler) and in plain view without being messy?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m planning on reorganizing my cellar (it&#39;s a finished cellar) and <br/>\nmaking it into a huge art area.
