Weve learned<br/>\nlots by living, but please keep in mind that learning a language with a<br/>\ntotally different alphabet is a whole different animal than learning say,<br/>\nGerman, French or Spanish.  I have friends who send their kids to Japanese<br/>\npreschooltheir kids have not learned anymore language than mine have by<br/>\nwatching Japanese TV, shopping for everyday stuff, having a Japanese<br/>\nhousecleaner who speaks no English, and playing with the kids in the<br/>\nneighborhood.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If they just stay home with me . .<br/>\n </span></blockquote>..  they won&#39;t learn as much.

Think for a minute how you<br/>\nare going to feel when you get there youll be overwhelmed by all the<br/>\ndifferences in daily lifedo you really want to add to that by suddenly<br/>\nimmersing them into school, too?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my book, you simply cant incorporate Chinese as a mandatory subject<br/>\nwhile still maintaining the<br/>\nchild-lead learning approach.  We got Usbornes The First 1000 Words in<br/>\nJapanese before we got here so wed know the words for some basics, but<br/>\nJapanese grammar still escapes us.  We manage fine though, people are happy<br/>\nto help.  Where in China are you going?  In most cities, almost everyone<br/>\nspeaks English anyway.  Another thought:  a year or two really isnt enough<br/>\ntime for much, if you spend it obsessing over Chinese School and language,<br/>\nyou might miss out on lots of cool stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nTami, who thinks the most valuable phrases to know in Japanese are Im<br/>\nsorry and I dont understand.  Because I often am, and dont.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>]On Behalf Of he11sbe11s70<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 16, 2005 4:01 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] &quot;mandatory&quot; subjects - foreign language<br/>\n<br/>\nHi<br/>\nI am new to the group - but I am preparing to homeschool my 4 year old and 1<br/>\nyear<br/>\nold and need all the help I can get!<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the unschooling and child-led learning idea.

Check out any chinese cultural centers in the community so you can start to feel familiar with it. Starting reading books, watching movies, talking to people of chinese descent you may know, watching related news. It&#39;s not the language that&#39;s important, it&#39;s the culture that the language reflects. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was listening to an interview with Addriene Clarkson (of Chinese descent coincidentally), our (Canada&#39;s) Governor-General. It&#39;s technically the hishest post in our gov&#39;t and the Queen&#39;s representative in Canada. It&#39;s really a figurehead position. Anyway, she was talking about how she learned french. How she thought she&#39;d learn it was take classes. Didn&#39;t work really. So she went to France. There she had to learn it. She mentioned that she always had trouble with pronouncing the &quot;r&#39;s&quot; (french r&#39;s are weird) until one day driving by the Louvre, she said Louvre - and it clicked. Her idea was that it wasn&#39;t until she was there long enough for the culture to settle in her bones that she was able to finally &#39;get&#39; the language. That you can&#39;t truly learn a language until you have some feeling for the culture supporting it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents lived in Thailand for a couple of years. They never learned Thai (you think Chinese is tough? You don&#39;t know Thai) but they did get involved in the Thai community, attened cultural events, got a true sense of the people and made lifelong Thai friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, learning to speak Chinese at the expense of diving into the culture would be like learning to read without loving books. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the language that important, it&#39;s the people and the culture. They may or may not end up speaking fluent chinese but please don&#39;t lock them up in school (or yourself up in the house!!!) for what may be an experience of a lifetime.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn (DON&quot;T SEND THEM TO SCHOOL THERE!!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
