This is not a conference. There will not be speakers. There will, however, be as many planned activities as the attendees want to organize, which can be anything from round table discussions, to crafts, games, and potluck dinners.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the second annual Summer Montreal Unschoolers Gathering (SMUG). Last year was a huge success, with around 70 people, all of whom seemed to have a great time! I know that my family is really looking forward to having as wonderful a gathering this year, and I hope you can join us in helping to make that happen!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo find out more about this summer&#39;s gathering, get updates, and connect with other potential attendees, join the SMUG Yahoo!
