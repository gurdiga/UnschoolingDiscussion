Tyler (my 5yos) likes to watch tv and play with the baby after breakfast. Then we all fix lunch (often different meals for everyone). After lunch, Brett usually wants to play on the computer or watch tv, sometimes he&#39;ll head on outside to play. Tyler usually heads to his room to play with his toys and games. DH comes home around 5 or 6, and they come back to the living room when he gets home, and we all do something together for an hour or so, then we all cook supper together. After supper, we set the timer for 15 minutes and each start in our own rooms and clean! After our rooms are straight, we do the bathrooms and living room.
