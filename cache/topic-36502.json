Like many things, I&#39;m sure folks with older<br/>\nkids perspectives on this are probably different than mine, since my son is<br/>\n5, not 15.  I can easily see how this might change as a child grows older.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the cook chooses the food here.  The cook is me, always, as at the<br/>\nmoment, I am the only one inclined toward kitchen duty.  But since my son<br/>\nleft the realm of really mushy food at a year or so, he has eaten what we<br/>\neat.  Options include take it or leave it.  That holds true for other<br/>\nchildren who have eaten at my house, friends and long-term visiting kids.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have the resources (financial or otherwise) to stock a variety of<br/>\nfoods for choosing; however, if someone decides to &quot;leave it&quot; with a<br/>\nparticular food, there is usually something on the table they &quot;take&quot;, so<br/>\nnobody starves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever thought of breakfast choices (icecream or otherwise)<br/>\nas related to unschooling, though!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36497,"nextTopicId":36504}}
