This offers a great way t o get perspective on this<br/>\nsituation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan,  who will have to wait &#39;til kidlets bedtime to get my thoughts out on<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO, I think as list owner, you have every right to ban individuals from<br/>\nthe list. I know you don&#39;t want to be police chief and I understand that&#39;s<br/>\nthe whole gist of this list... no monitoring.<br/>\nLet&#39;s say you own a bookstore and you sell all kinds of books (not that you<br/>\n*like* all these kinds of books.. just that they are available to everybody<br/>\ninterested). You have tons of repeat customers... for years. You job is to<br/>\nstock the store, etc. but you don&#39;t have to police the patrons... they&#39;re<br/>\nfolks who have come to your store with a purpose...to get information or<br/>\n(buy books). All of a sudden, a new person enters the store and starts going<br/>\nup to each patron and criticizing what they&#39;re reading. Some of them ignore<br/>\nthis person. Others walk away in a huff. One of them goes next door and<br/>\nstarts her *own* book store and takes some of the original patrons with her.<br/>\nBut there you are, still owner of the bookstore and watching it go down in a<br/>\npile of dust.. fast. This store has meant a lot to you in the past and you<br/>\nrecoginize it&#39;s also meant a lot to other people in town.  Do you just sit<br/>\nback behind the register and let this go on or do you ask the person(s)<br/>\ncausing the rukus to leave? IMHO, you have a job to do *if* you still care<br/>\nabout your &#39;store&#39;.....<br/>\n<br/>\nor are you looking for a reason to shut it down? (I&#39;m hoping not!)<br/>\nSarah</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29456,"nextTopicId":29467}}
