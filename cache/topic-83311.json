My husband has exspressed that he wants nothing <br/>\nmore to come home to their smiling faces everyday after <br/>\nhomeschooling them he would like to see both happen !!  However, I <br/>\ndo realize that because of the dynamics it would be the BIGGEST <br/>\nchallange I have ever taken on. I thought it was funny how you <br/>\npicked up on the &quot;enimies&quot; thing.  I guess she is reaching out and <br/>\nperhaps she is willing to try ANYTHING as crazy as it may seem. <br/>\nPerhaps,when I pick up the children I will open the topic and invite <br/>\nher to talk with me when the children are not around. <br/>\nThe oldest that is 15 is at a very critical age in his life and I <br/>\nfeel this is where we can loose him. He has been wanting to live <br/>\nwith us since he was 6 and quite frankly I always wanted him but I <br/>\nam tired of this yo yo thing. At least the children have not been <br/>\ntossed back and fourth but still I feel it is just as hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, bottom line I will only take them if she is willing to let <br/>\nthem live under our prefrence of lifestyle.  What I&#39;m wondering is <br/>\nhow can I offer it gently without letting her feel like a bad <br/>\nmother.  Ultimately I think she would love to send them but doesn&#39;t <br/>\nfor fear of &quot;how she looks as a mother&quot; or feeling as if she failed <br/>\nin some way. Or perhaps she might be afraid that if she sends them <br/>\nto me they may be worse &quot;because&quot; I do homeschool. I have no idea <br/>\nwhat she thinkss but as you all know most people do not APPROVE of <br/>\nthe concept at all.  So I would like to ease her mind in some way <br/>\nthat it could be very benificial for them without making her feel <br/>\nbad.  She is constanly comparing herself to me with the children and <br/>\nI want to aviod that here - I don&#39;t want it to be a contest.  I <br/>\ntruly want whats best for the children. I know it is about the boys <br/>\nbut I&#39;m sure there is a ton of emotions that goes on when you turn <br/>\nyour children over to someone else and I would like to help her feel <br/>\nbetter about that so she could focus more on her boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat could I do to offer her or to make her feel better about <br/>\nhomeschooling ?? What could I do to help her be at peace with <br/>\nwhatever decsion she makes.  Ultimately it is about the boys but <br/>\nthat is one of their BIGGEST problems it has always been about her.  <br/>\nThe children were never put first they were always caught up in that <br/>\nnasty divorce thing :( So I feel the only way that I can help them <br/>\nis to sort of help her first if that makes any sense ?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSonya<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Searching for words","postDate":"1067359262","msgId":83329,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkZi4xMjQ0ZDA2OS4yY2NmZjYxZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":83323,"nextInTopic":83342,"prevInTime":83328,"nextInTime":83330,"topicId":83311,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/28/03 8:59:51 AM, Halo5964@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-434628710\">In a message dated 10/28/03 8:59:51 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Halo5964@...\">Halo5964@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  If they come to live with you, they are going to be <br/>\nhomeschooled, period.

His ex-<br/>\nwife was at the her the end of her ropes with the children (both <br/>\nboys 15 and 11) who are doing horribly in school. She was looking <br/>\nfor my husband to rescue her and like I said many times before to <br/>\nboth of them is all I can do is offer to keep the boys with me to <br/>\nhomeschool (unschool)them with my 7 year old son. Of course they are <br/>\nstill trying to grasp the whole concept of homeschool so I don&#39;t <br/>\nscare them with the word unschool as of yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course my husband would want nothing more than to have them here <br/>\nbut his ex-wife is dead against it (right now anyway). She wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nget all that lovely $$ support (another story - another list). As <br/>\nfor me I know they could benifit just from being out of the school <br/>\nsystem and it would be a BIG ADJUSTMENT but I am sure it would be a <br/>\nlearning exsperoence for all. I would be willing to take on the <br/>\nchallange though. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have gone through this before this many tmes and life just goes <br/>\non and on.  This time she said to my husband that she wants all four <br/>\nof us to get together and talk. I say to my husband I whole <br/>\ndifferent philosophy on school and education why the hell would you <br/>\nwant to get together and talk with me or why would I want to talk <br/>\nwith you ??? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I was wondering if you had any suggestions. I thought all I <br/>\ncan do is offer my life style and what I believe in and they can do <br/>\nwhat they want with it.  Does anyone have any complicated blended <br/>\nfamily stories to share about unschooling ?? Does anyone unschool <br/>\ntheir stepchildren at all ?? I thought if she is desparate she might <br/>\ntake me up on the offer.  I know she would never dream of doing it <br/>\nherself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you ,<br/>\nSonya</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83315,"nextTopicId":83381}}
