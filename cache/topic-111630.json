However, if you <br/>\nhad some concern about that you could have addressed by asking the <br/>\nabove question about supervision without, what I percieved to be, <br/>\nthe accusation that follows.  I felt that you immediately accused <br/>\nthat I was neglectful in not so many words.  If you don&#39;t know the <br/>\ncircumstances surrounding an event you can ask, get your answer, and <br/>\nthen decide whether or not you need to address the situation with <br/>\nyour opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in MY opinion it is an individual decision that families need <br/>\nto make based on the maturity level of each child involved.  There <br/>\nare 16 year olds that can&#39;t be left alone even to take care of <br/>\nthemselves because they are simply not responsible enough yet to <br/>\nmake good and safe choices.  There are also 11 year old children and <br/>\nsome even younger in our state that are latch key kids and are very <br/>\nresponsible for their age.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeaving children at home alone for any period of time has certain <br/>\nrisks associated with it but so does letting them do just about any <br/>\nother activity out there.  My 11 yo son, for instance, plays one <br/>\nstreet over with out me there with him for 1.5 - 2 hours at a time.  <br/>\nI have helped him all that I feel I can about making safe decisions <br/>\nwithout me there to hold his hand.  He checks in with me and goes <br/>\nback to play if he chooses.  This didn&#39;t happen over night, but in <br/>\ntime he learned what he needed to in order to be able to go.  He <br/>\ngoes there to play because the *14 yo* boy that lives there is not <br/>\nallowed to leave his cul-de-sac, because his parents feel he not <br/>\nresponsible enough.  That is their choice based on how they see <br/>\ntheir son.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I be sure that he will not get hurt, be abducted or some have <br/>\nsome other horrific tragedy befall him?  Of course not, there are <br/>\nnever any guarantees, but we do the very best that we can to help <br/>\nprevent bad things from happening to our children, but when you have <br/>\ndone all that you know how to do to ensure their safety and well <br/>\nbeing then that is, once again in my opinion, the best that we can <br/>\ndo. I am not going to make him stay home and have no freedom until <br/>\nhe hits some magical age made up by somebody else, fit to some other <br/>\nchild.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may be very uncomfortable with ever leaving your children home <br/>\nalone or letting them out of your site for that matter and that is <br/>\nfine.  I won&#39;t judge you.  If it doesn&#39;t feel right to you then you <br/>\nshould probably go with your gut instinct.  I think it was and is <br/>\nwrong to judge someone without all the facts.  Family dynamics <br/>\ndiffer greatly and each child has to be viewed as an individual.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many other things to address as well, like do they have an <br/>\nadult they can access immediately (next door neighbor), do they <br/>\nunderstand how to use 911 and know other emergency contacts, how <br/>\nlong is the adult going to be away and how far are they going and <br/>\nmany more things to consider.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, you may disagree with me, but you posted your opinion of <br/>\nmy choices without any information to back up your concerns.  You <br/>\nstated how worried you were that my children were alone.  Maybe next <br/>\ntime you should ask before jumping to conclusions and assumptions <br/>\nwhen you simply don&#39;t have the facts.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, my children were not unattended, my neigbor was here!<br/>\nMy post wasn&#39;t concerning a babysitting issue so it didn&#39;t cross my <br/>\nmind to start it with...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I was at the store and a baby sitter was watching my children  <br/>\nin my home I...<br/>\n<br/>\nDana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":254415870,"authorName":"Lisa M.

He still reads half the day, watches <br/>\nmovies 1/4 of the day, and goes to his friends for a couple of <br/>\nhours.

The list will <br/>\nbe in place so that if they want to be helpful then they will have <br/>\nsomething to go with that they know really does need to be done at <br/>\nsome point.  Like a reference point if they want one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t feel like I need to make him feel like the &quot;man&quot;.  <br/>\nAlthough, now that I am thinking about it, there are times when he <br/>\nsees me doing something that he feels is too much for me, and he <br/>\nbasically takes over.  In those instances what I see in him is that <br/>\nhe is proud, because he is stronger than me.  And all those times <br/>\nare self-initiated.  I am always grateful because he is stronger <br/>\nthan me and he always picks the perfect time to catch me and help.  <br/>\nHe really is an awesome kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell these were interesting points that you made and I think I <br/>\nshould keep a watchful eye on the situation to be sure that he (or <br/>\nthe girls) don&#39;t feel like they have to be the adult because there <br/>\nis only one for awhile.

He left <br/>\nFriday.  Though it was very sad to see him go, I feel that the <br/>\nanxiety of waiting for him to leave is over for all of our family.  <br/>\nI think some of my son&#39;s behavior was exacerbated by the fact that <br/>\nhe was dealing with the emotions of my husband&#39;s leaving.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSince he has gone my son is being very loving to me, considerate, <br/>\nand defensive over me.  For instance, he has initiated what seems <br/>\nlike a million hugs and kisses (which is not normally him).  He has <br/>\nalso been very protective of my feelings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLike yesterday I went to the grocery store and before I went I asked <br/>\neveryone if they wanted somethings special.  I usually do this and <br/>\nit is almost always something different each time for each one.  <br/>\nWell the youngest 5yog wasn&#39;t awake when I left so I didn&#39;t wake her <br/>\nto ask and grabbed some starburst for her thinking she would love <br/>\nthem.  Well needless to say, she was very disappointed because it <br/>\nwas not what she would have asked for and boy did she ever let me <br/>\nhave it.  Well my son was very upset with her and told her he <br/>\nthought that she was ungrateful and being a brat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t upset about it, except I couldn&#39;t get her to stop crying.  <br/>\nI offered to go back to the store, and she said no.  The other kids <br/>\noffered to share their treats with her, and she said no.  She was <br/>\nbasically inconsolable for 30 mins. I went and laid down on the bed <br/>\nwith her and told her how sorry I was and that next time I would be <br/>\nsure to find out what she would like before I went.  I also told her <br/>\nthat I thought what she was feeling was disappointment and that it <br/>\nhappens to everyone now and then.  She finally calmed down and all <br/>\nwas well in her world again.  She happily ate her starburst and even <br/>\nshared them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then explained to my son that it was my fault for not planning <br/>\nbetter for her.  I also told him that he needed to remember that she <br/>\nwas 5 years old and didn&#39;t act that way because she was a spoiled <br/>\nbrat, but rather because she was VERY disappointed and that was they <br/>\nonly way she knew to express that emotion.  I am not sure if he <br/>\nfully understood, but he no longer showed anger or frustration <br/>\ntoward her.  Which was really big for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I just wanted to share our progress in our house.  But now I <br/>\nhave a question.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son came to me yesterday morning and asked me to make a chore <br/>\nlist so that the kids would know what I needed help with around the <br/>\nhouse.  I stood there quite shocked that he would think of helping <br/>\non his own like that.  So I have been pondering how to handle this.  <br/>\nI really could use the help if the kids are willing, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to be assigning chores that they feel they &quot;have&quot; to do.

Any other ideas of how I may go about this in a productive <br/>\nand joyful way?<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to say thanks again to all who initially replied a week <br/>\nor so ago when I posted about my son.  I have applied some of the <br/>\nwonderful advice and am at this point reaping the benefits of your <br/>\nwisdom and gaining more of my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nDana</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111505,"nextTopicId":111696}}
