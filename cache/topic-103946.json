I have a dd 14 who is editing a book that she has written (I think it&#39;s 427 pages now), and she has it planned out to be a trilogy.  When she was 10 I could not interest her in reading anything until I bought every &quot;Pokiman&quot; book I could find.  From there she jumped to Tolkien and adores him.  Tolkien led to Medieval History and this led to a desire to write her own book of fantasy.  She is very dedicated to this and can&#39;t wait to try to get it published.  She has developed a love of History,  medieval weapons, fantasy, geography, and who knows what else thanks to Tolkien.  Of course &quot;Pokiman&quot; started her interest in reading.  I always tell people it doesn&#39;t matter what they read as long as they read, they will branch out on their own. <br/>\n<br/>\nSheryl<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;do not meddle with the affairs of dragons, for you are crunchy and good <br/>\nwith ketchup.&quot;  annon.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Speaking the Truth in times of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.&quot; George Orwell<br/>\n<br/>\n  Message: 8         <br/>\n     Date: Thu, 24 Feb 2005 21:39:05 -0000<br/>\n     From: &quot;Heidi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bunsofaluminum60@...\">bunsofaluminum60@...</a>&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bunsofaluminum60@...\">bunsofaluminum60@...</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>\n  Subject: Re: article suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  It started with her reading Tolkien, from there into a love for <br/>\n  Medieval history, and early English literature, including Chaucer and <br/>\n  of course, Shakespeare.
