I have a son who is really an animal <br/>\nlover and has been for his entire life. He&#39;s now 8, almost 9. I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t wanted a dog because I don&#39;t want to hound (he he) the <br/>\nkids to look after it and I may have allergies. I&#39;m also a bird lover <br/>\nand I don&#39;t like the idea of our dog chasing them all away from <br/>\nour yard.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet my son has a passion that it unbending toward animals and <br/>\nwould love a dog or pet or something! That&#39;s why we began with <br/>\npet rats. This worked well for him because rats are friendly, <br/>\nclean (yes, they are) and intelligent. They also have short life <br/>\nspans. They were full of cysts and had to be put to sleep after <br/>\ntwo years. This turned out to be about the right life span for a pet <br/>\nfor him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe now have membership passes to our city zoo. And we&#39;re <br/>\ntalking about the next pet... which may actually be a dog. I&#39;m <br/>\nworking up to it. We read about animals, we watch birds together <br/>\n(he&#39;s becoming quite a birder!) and he even stops to look at <br/>\ninsects (yesterday: &quot;Mommy, Mommy, come quickly. We have <br/>\nbaby bees all over our flowers. They&#39;re so cute!&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older kids have asked for a dog many times, but then they <br/>\nlose interest in even asking. My 8 yr old has an undying love for <br/>\nthem.

I highly recommend a canary that can be <br/>\nnear a sunny window. They make the most incredible music. We <br/>\nalso had numerous parakeets. Their cages need cleaning and <br/>\nthey do need food and water, but they don&#39;t actually need to be <br/>\nplayed with.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had neighbors who used to allow their parakeet to fly around <br/>\nthe family room. That was exciting! My mom didn&#39;t go in for that. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe later had an African grey parrot. It was loud, very messy, and <br/>\nmean spirited when you&#39;d open the cage door. I feel sorry for the <br/>\nbig fella now. I don&#39;t think African grey parrots are meant to be in <br/>\ncages.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur family now has had one bunny and two pet rats. The bunny <br/>\nwas a waste of time and money. Not friendly at all. The rats, otoh, <br/>\nwere wonderful! If my son would cycle out of his daily interest, I <br/>\nwould just take one of the rats out from time to time myself. This <br/>\nalmost always re-awakened his interest in them. My husband <br/>\nwould too. He&#39;d take a rat and put it on his leg and let the little <br/>\nguy climb up to his waist (while lying down).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen our son would jump right in. Sometimes it&#39;s more fun to <br/>\nplay with a pet... while playing with a human too. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Pets","postDate":"1055078073","msgId":72860,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhNC4xNThjMmIxNy4yYzE0OTBiOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":72859,"nextInTopic":72862,"prevInTime":72859,"nextInTime":72861,"topicId":72773,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/7/03 10:28:42 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

I vowed I&#39;d take care of them, and I did for a day.  Then I&#39;d get bored of it and forget about the care.  I loved playing with the pets, but hated the responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the time, when I see parents worrying about their kids not taking care of pets, its because they think their kids are growing up to be irresponsible.  (Funny how we have a tendency to take one small thing like that and make it into the &quot;big picture&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news is, this worry is really unnecessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, I&#39;m a full grown adult.  And when I got my dog, I was afraid I&#39;d be irresponsible (bec. that is what I always heard from my parents about how I didn&#39;t care for my pets).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe truth is, I LOVE animals, and I DO take really good care of them, now that I&#39;m an adult.  So for all of these years, I&#39;ve lived with this fear that I would be the cause of some animal&#39;s suffering and avoided getting a pet of my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of my own experience, I&#39;ve decided that when we get pets, they are for me to care for.  So, if its something I feel *I* can handle, I might do it (unless hubby objects).  But if I can&#39;t, I&#39;ll say &quot;no&quot; but I don&#39;t necessarily lecture anyone on the proper care of pets like I might have a few years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying anyone else here was doing that, just me :o).<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: jmcseals SEALS <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, June 08, 2003 1:49 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Pets<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;When a child says they want a pet (or shows an interest in something) do <br/>\n  we<br/>\n  rush out and get it?

Of course, there are times for <br/>\n  spontinaeity but bringing a pet into our homes isn&#39;t a good time for that! <br/>\n  ;)  They may indicate they really, really want it the first time they see <br/>\n  it.  Caring for another living being is a big responsibility and one that <br/>\n  deserves serious consideration and thought.  I don&#39;t think there is a way to <br/>\n  really know how much they want it other than listening to them and watching <br/>\n  them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Boy, I wish I supported all my kids&#39; interests but the truth is, I don&#39;t.  I <br/>\n  acknowledge what they express interest in but sometimes things just look <br/>\n  cool and they don&#39;t want or need me to rush out and grab everything I can <br/>\n  get my hands on related to the moon, just because tonight it happened to <br/>\n  look really cool hiding behind the clouds.  There are times that they do <br/>\n  express an interest in something and I simply can&#39;t indulge them.  My <br/>\n  daughter wants a $300 bike but will have to wait until we move and get <br/>\n  settled.  She&#39;s also going to earn money to pay for half of it because it is <br/>\n  above what we can spend on a bike.  Imagine if all seven of my kids wanted a <br/>\n  $300 bike!  OUCH!<br/>\n<br/>\n  If we ran with every little whim our kids have....well in my case, I&#39;d need <br/>\n  my husband to pick up about 35 more jobs and 10 more houses to store all the <br/>\n  junk in! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;I suppose there are no set answers to those questions.  Knowing my <br/>\n  children<br/>\n  will give me clues.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think the best thing you can do is to relax.  Don&#39;t worry that you might <br/>\n  be depriving them of diving into every possible new adventure head first.  <br/>\n  Kids do a lot when left to their own devices.  The key is to support their <br/>\n  emotional and physical needs and find creative solutions and possibilities <br/>\n  for all the rest.  You don&#39;t have to rush out and buy a bird right away.  Or <br/>\n  a clarinet, volleyball net or anything else for that matter.  If you feel <br/>\n  the urge to rush out and buy or do, take a trip to the library and talk <br/>\n  about birds on the way there.  Maybe your daughter will grab a bird book.  <br/>\n  Or maybe she&#39;ll grab a cookbook and beg you for a set of her own pots and <br/>\n  pans!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kids feel everything with such passion and zest.  Trust your judgement and <br/>\n  hone in on those patience skills.  It will all work out in the end and you <br/>\n  will have drawn the perfect line of balance and happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n  _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  Protect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online  <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\">http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

How can we tell how much they want it?<br/>\nWhere is the line between the unschooling parent who supports all the kids&#39;<br/>\ninterests and the one who doesn&#39;t do enough?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, maybe, we can&#39;t, there isn&#39;t one. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think there are many things we should rush out and do, save putting <br/>\nour a fire or some other drastic necessity.  Of course, there are times for <br/>\nspontinaeity but bringing a pet into our homes isn&#39;t a good time for that! <br/>\n;)  They may indicate they really, really want it the first time they see <br/>\nit.  Caring for another living being is a big responsibility and one that <br/>\ndeserves serious consideration and thought.  I don&#39;t think there is a way to <br/>\nreally know how much they want it other than listening to them and watching <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoy, I wish I supported all my kids&#39; interests but the truth is, I don&#39;t.  I <br/>\nacknowledge what they express interest in but sometimes things just look <br/>\ncool and they don&#39;t want or need me to rush out and grab everything I can <br/>\nget my hands on related to the moon, just because tonight it happened to <br/>\nlook really cool hiding behind the clouds.  There are times that they do <br/>\nexpress an interest in something and I simply can&#39;t indulge them.  My <br/>\ndaughter wants a $300 bike but will have to wait until we move and get <br/>\nsettled.  She&#39;s also going to earn money to pay for half of it because it is <br/>\nabove what we can spend on a bike.  Imagine if all seven of my kids wanted a <br/>\n$300 bike!  OUCH!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we ran with every little whim our kids have....well in my case, I&#39;d need <br/>\nmy husband to pick up about 35 more jobs and 10 more houses to store all the <br/>\njunk in! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I suppose there are no set answers to those questions.  Knowing my <br/>\nchildren<br/>\nwill give me clues.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the best thing you can do is to relax.  Don&#39;t worry that you might <br/>\nbe depriving them of diving into every possible new adventure head first.  <br/>\nKids do a lot when left to their own devices.  The key is to support their <br/>\nemotional and physical needs and find creative solutions and possibilities <br/>\nfor all the rest.  You don&#39;t have to rush out and buy a bird right away.  Or <br/>\na clarinet, volleyball net or anything else for that matter.  If you feel <br/>\nthe urge to rush out and buy or do, take a trip to the library and talk <br/>\nabout birds on the way there.  Maybe your daughter will grab a bird book.  <br/>\nOr maybe she&#39;ll grab a cookbook and beg you for a set of her own pots and <br/>\npans!<br/>\n<br/>\nKids feel everything with such passion and zest.  Trust your judgement and <br/>\nhone in on those patience skills.  It will all work out in the end and you <br/>\nwill have drawn the perfect line of balance and happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\">http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Pets","postDate":"1055049480","msgId":72842,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTIwMWMzMmQ3ZCQ1ZjkzZjVjMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjE2UHF2V1VwaTFjODQwMDA1ZmNjY0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72834,"nextInTopic":72844,"prevInTime":72841,"nextInTime":72843,"topicId":72773,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... need ... animal, ...

I <br/>\nthink it is reasonable to expect that when they asked for the animal they <br/>\nhad every intention in the world of caring for it and providing it with <br/>\nundying attention and love.  By emphasizing THEY, it sounds as though *you* <br/>\nhave expectations of them that they have not met.  Honestly, I don&#39;t think <br/>\nit is reasonable or realistic to expect a 10 yr old child to fully grasp the <br/>\npermanance of an animal&#39;s needs.  I know some children do, but I know a lot <br/>\ndon&#39;t!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; If it&#39;s a puzzle or game that gets played once in a blue moon, it is easy <br/>\nenough to<br/>\nstick it in the garage until the next time.

They all have their &#39;honeymoon&#39; phases of interest.  They <br/>\nall take up space, time and money and must be cared for if we want them to <br/>\nbe kept in good condition.  I realize there is an emotional and living need <br/>\nwith the animal, but to a child, it&#39;s not much different.  In the beginning, <br/>\nit&#39;s all sugar and chocolate.  Sooner or later, you begin to crave salt.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;My 10yod clearly loves animals.  Especially ones that we don&#39;t own!  I am<br/>\ntaking her to guide dog puppy training classes and I assist as needed with<br/>\nher pet sitting jobs.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s great!  She will have an opportunity to spend time with animals she <br/>\nloves without any worries!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; For the past couple of months she has been asking for<br/>\na pet bird.  I&#39;m not against her having a pet bird, but I wonder if it will<br/>\nend up being treated like the hamster is treated, or should I say not<br/>\ntreated, but ignored most of the time.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are willing to accept that it *will* be ignored most of the time by <br/>\nyour child and are willing to step in and give it the attention it needs, <br/>\nthen get the bird!  If you feel like you will be resentful, put out and <br/>\nirritated, don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Maybe I need to revise my idea of<br/>\nhow much attention certain pets need.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot necessarily.

I have been there far too many times <br/>\nand it wasn&#39;t until *I* changed my perspective that the problem was solved.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we trust our children to know when and how to acquire knowledge, then a <br/>\nnatural extension of that trust would be understanding that they will care <br/>\nfor their pets and give their love and attention when they want to and need <br/>\nto.

I don&#39;t think, no matter how much you<br/>\nexplain it, they understand the work that really goes in to taking care of<br/>\nit. So with that in mind, I would think a parent, before taking on a pet,<br/>\nunderstands that for the most part, when the kids are young, you will be<br/>\ntaking care of the pet. If that&#39;s fine then go for it. If you don&#39;t want<br/>\nthat responsibility, then don&#39;t get one. If you get a pet thinking you won&#39;t<br/>\nbe having to take care of it, and find you are and don&#39;t want to, I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink it&#39;s unreasonable to sit and explain exactly what bothers you about<br/>\nhaving the pet and what needs to be done to keep the pet in the house. Again<br/>\nI think it&#39;s unrealistic to expect total pet care from the child. If you can<br/>\ncome to an agreement, then great. If not I would think it kinder to find the<br/>\npet a better caring home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a pet lover. Always have been. We never had many pets because my mom is<br/>\nnot an animal lover. The few times we were able to get a dog or cat, even<br/>\nthen I would not completely take care of the pet. As much as I wanted it and<br/>\nloved it, I was a kid and had other things to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now we have 2 dogs, 2 cats, 1 snake, 2 fish tanks with 14 fish and 1 frog<br/>\nand 3 hermit crabs. Some fish, 1 cat, 1 dog, the snake and the hermit crabs<br/>\nare supposed to be some of the children&#39;s pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feed the dogs most days, always feed the cats, always clean the fish tanks<br/>\nand crab tanks. I feed the fish, check the water, feed the crabs, bath one<br/>\ndog, cut all the nails and water the snake. My husband cleans the snake cage<br/>\nand feeds him. My daughter cleans the litter box. We have the bully taken<br/>\nelsewhere to bath. We walk both dogs and I let them out all day plus clean<br/>\npuke and whatever they have chewed for the day. The kids play with the dogs<br/>\nand cat sometimes. They play with the hermit crabs although not as much as<br/>\nwhen we first got them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really fine with all this as I knew what I would be doing when we got<br/>\nthem all. I&#39;m actually thinking of getting a turtle and maybe a bunny<br/>\ntoo..........for the kids. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"jmcseals SEALS","from":"&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Pets","postDate":"1055021210","msgId":72792,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjIwb0ZUM2tNVVZmTkkwMDA2MDkwMUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72773,"nextInTopic":72798,"prevInTime":72791,"nextInTime":72793,"topicId":72773,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" I guess it all depends on what you consider to be an ultimatum.

I don&#39;t see <br/>\nanything wrong with saying that you don&#39;t want to be fully responsibile for <br/>\nthe hamster and you are going to need help.  Otherwise, in his best <br/>\ninterests, you will have to find him a good home.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, having said that!  *I* think it is unrealistic for parents to assume <br/>\nthat young children are capable of providing total care for their pets.  In <br/>\nthe beginning, they are cute and cuddly and fun to watch and play with.  <br/>\nBut, over time, they become like anything else...video games, books, <br/>\nswingsets....they get old.  Asking a young child to make a life-long <br/>\ncommitment to an animal is a lot to ask, imo.  Even if that lifetime lasts <br/>\nonly two years!  My 12 yr old, who is very responsibile, isn&#39;t yet ready to <br/>\nmake that commitment.  Or, at least, not without a lot of fuss and heal <br/>\ndragging.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we take pets in, I assume that they will be *my* pets and my <br/>\nresponsibility.  Then, if the kids help out with their care, all the better <br/>\nfor me!  I allow them freedom in pet care, just as I do in their attainment <br/>\nof knowledge.  I can&#39;t imagine forcing a textbook anymore than the care for <br/>\na live animal!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it has to be a cut and dry ultimatum.  Have you thought of <br/>\ngetting another hamster and some excercise equipment for him?  Do they <br/>\nreally need to be let out daily?  I don&#39;t know!  We&#39;ve never had a hamster.  <br/>\nLOL I know vets recommend getting a playmate (of the canine persuasion) if <br/>\ntheir dog is lonely.  Wouldn&#39;t this also work for your pet?  If not, I would <br/>\ndiscuss the needs of the hamster with the kids and let them know that you <br/>\ncan&#39;t take full responsibility for it.  I wouldnt&#39; force them or require <br/>\nthem to take him out everyday but I would let them know that if he isn&#39;t <br/>\ngetting what he needs that the loving and responsibile thing to do would be <br/>\nto find him another home.  Then, I&#39;d give it a few weeks and if nothing <br/>\nchanged, I&#39;d ask for their help in finding him a new place to live.  Maybe, <br/>\nfaced with the thought of having to lose him, the thought of spending a <br/>\nlittle more time with him everyday won&#39;t seem such a bad price to pay.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m way off!  I&#39;m interested in hearing what others have to say!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?
