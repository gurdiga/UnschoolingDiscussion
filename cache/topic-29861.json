You may want to get a good book on the<br/>\nsubject and read first about how you want to handle your new puppy. Or find<br/>\na trainer and audit some classes if they&#39;ll let you. Don&#39;t rely just on what<br/>\nyou&#39;ve done before. Any book or source that tells you to punish the puppy,<br/>\nthrow away (don&#39;t donate it, we don&#39;t want those things back in<br/>\ncirculation!) Karen Pryor&#39;s book &quot;Don&#39;t Shoot the Dog,&quot; while older, is one<br/>\nof the best theory books around. It&#39;s not a practical training manual, but<br/>\nit does outline behavioral conditioning principles very well. Can be used<br/>\nwith husbands and children too! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there are good areas on the web and in books on selecting a puppy.<br/>\nRead them and go with a hard heart and a clear eye. What I mean is that it&#39;s<br/>\neasy to pick the first one who comes bounding up to you and chews on your<br/>\nshoe. Or, you get the shy, coughing runt with red eyes because you feel<br/>\nsorry for her. Don&#39;t be afraid to look at more than one litter. If possible,<br/>\ndon&#39;t take the kids with you (it&#39;s a surprise, so probably not, right?)<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s very hard to walk away when your kids have that look! Put the<br/>\npuppy through the puppy personality tests found in books or websites (can be<br/>\nused with older dogs too) and spend time with them. And I second the mention<br/>\nof adopting an older dog. Personality is set, they&#39;re either housebroken or<br/>\nnot, and they&#39;re so grateful! (Isn&#39;t that what Benjamin Franklin said about<br/>\nolder women?)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get you started:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.petnet.com.au/selectapet.html\">http://www.petnet.com.au/selectapet.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pets.msn.com/dogs/choose/default.asp\">http://pets.msn.com/dogs/choose/default.asp</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.canismajor.com/dog/tchoose.html\">http://www.canismajor.com/dog/tchoose.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dogs.about.com/cs/choosingadog/\">http://dogs.about.com/cs/choosingadog/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n_____-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 12 Dec 2001 04:10:40 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheran@...\">sheran@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: speaking of dogs...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 3 kids and a husband who want a dog...We are talking about<br/>\nsurprising them with a puppy for Easter or maybe for their summer<br/>\nbirthdays, when the weather will be nicer and they&#39;ll be able to play<br/>\naround with him outside a lot.
