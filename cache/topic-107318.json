For all of his expressed worry that we might<br/>\nhave to “make her”, he was just blowing off steam by saying those kind of<br/>\nthings to me in our “How far can we let this go” discussions. When it came<br/>\nto the crunch sitting in a dentist’s office, he was splendid.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is so cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see Keith defend our kids from his mom in really sweet ways.   He still <br/>\nhardly stands up to her himself, about himself, but he will block her when she <br/>\nstarts toward one of ours (philosophically or verbally).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt probably helps some that James and Keith are both big confident guys, too. <br/>\n  I&#39;ve seen doctors intimidate full grown men without blinking an eye, so any <br/>\nadvantage, when it comes to doctors and their recitation of &quot;how it has to <br/>\nbe&quot; is a good advantage.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby had a lot of dental problems, and had four steel-capped teeth when he <br/>\nwas little, because some of his enamel was just no good.   Neither Keith nor I <br/>\nhad that problem when we were little, so I have no idea what it might&#39;ve come <br/>\nfrom.   Marty&#39;s and Holly&#39;s were both much better.   With his permanent teeth, <br/>\nKirby&#39;s seem fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to take the extra kids to the dentist and we&#39;d watch whichever kid was <br/>\nin the chair.   Another cool thing about the pediatric dentist we used to go <br/>\nto (who&#39;s retired now) is that they had three chairs all in one big room, so <br/>\nthere was no mystery-room with big noise to make kids use their imaginations.   <br/>\nThey could watch other kids even without coming with siblings, and I think <br/>\nthat was very helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have another dentist now, and I try to ask the receptionists to <br/>\nreschedule every time I&#39;m there, at least for a cleaning, because I have a big <br/>\ndentist-aversion, and would stall for years, so I ask Keith and the kids and the <br/>\nschedulers to send us cards, call, make sure.   Not because I believe it&#39;s <br/>\nnecessary, but because I believe I would procrastinate.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately, Marty and Kirby take themselves.   They&#39;ve been scheduled on the same <br/>\nday twice, so they just go together.   Cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly wanted braces (and needed them) and is over halfway through treatment.  <br/>\n Marty and Kirby had said they didn&#39;t want them, but the new dentist said <br/>\nthat was fine for Kirby, whose teeth are symmetrically crooked (the center top <br/>\ntwo are inside, a bit, of the next two out), but otherwise fine.   Marty&#39;s that <br/>\nLOOK better, are way crowded in the back.   Keith has had precisely the same <br/>\ndental problems the dentist told him Marty might have if he didn&#39;t get this <br/>\ntaken care of, so Marty agree, even though he&#39;s likely to have braces past his <br/>\n18th birthday and he thinks that&#39;s just wrong. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Marty and Holly take good care of their braces, and having had the <br/>\noption not to get them is very likely part of what makes it easy and sensible for <br/>\nthem to do that.   If we pressed against their will to host some complicated <br/>\nhardware for two years or more, they might rightfully have resented the extra <br/>\ncare it takes, but they chose and we gave them the gift of paying for something <br/>\nthat they wanted to do.   It&#39;s just a whole different dynamic from when the <br/>\nconversation is all between the parent and dentist, over the child&#39;s head <br/>\nwithout a glance to see whether she&#39;d just rather have crooked teeth or get braces <br/>\nas an adult or whatever.   There really ARE options.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad you shared all that Robyn, but I don&#39;t think you should feel so <br/>\nguilty.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":87464191,"authorName":"Cheryl","from":"&quot;Cheryl&quot; &lt;bapretzel2@...&gt;","profile":"bapretzel_2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Final part - teeth saga","postDate":"1121623589","msgId":107322,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNTAwMWM1OGFmYSQ0MWY3NzI4MCQwMzAyYThjMEBjb21wdXRlcm5hbWU+","inReplyToHeader":"PGZmLjE3YTQ2OTFhLjMwMGMxMmNiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107321,"nextInTopic":107323,"prevInTime":107321,"nextInTime":107323,"topicId":107318,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Both James and I are feeling pretty wracked with<br/>\nguilt that we allowed this decayed tooth to get as far as it did. We both<br/>\nwere seeking the help of people who were pretty strongly pressuring us to<br/>\nabandon our ideals and philosophy in the face of medicine. We are both<br/>\nextremely grateful that we didn�t, and that it never came to a place where<br/>\nwe thought we would have to do so to save Jayn�s life.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe the abundant Universe, some may think of a named Deity, sends us<br/>\nmessages as we need them, and if we don�t recognize them sends a more<br/>\nforceful signal. I was procrastinating finding Jayn the right dentist, so I<br/>\nwas �sent� a more serious message to get my dumb ass moving.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy reasons for my slowness were good enough, as I *thought* then. I was<br/>\nwaiting for Jayn�s willingness to become more than sporadic islands in a sea<br/>\nof fear and nervousness. Looking at it now, I see that I was squandering<br/>\nthose moments of willingness, and finding justifications for waiting, and<br/>\nfailing to heed the gentle messages that I was being sent, including the<br/>\nkindly expressed concerns of my unschooling friends IRL. Allison, you were<br/>\nright.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn researching about tooth decay and similar situations I took heart from<br/>\nthe stories of self-healing and nerves simply dying and the �easy stories�.<br/>\nI mentally minimized or ignored the more serious tales, while still being<br/>\nable to be grateful that Jayn does not have tooth problems like flaking<br/>\nenamel beginning with her the first eruption. I now think that many of these<br/>\nfolk with less serious issues probably have the Periodontal or Periapical<br/>\nabscesses, both of which can evidently be treated to a great extent with<br/>\nlocalized drainage. (one source of info HYPERLINK<br/>\n&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ncemi.org/cse/cse0418.htm&quot;http://www.ncemi.org/cse/cse0418.htm\">http://www.ncemi.org/cse/cse0418.htm&quot;http://www.ncemi.org/cse/cse0418.htm</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is not what Jayn has anymore. She has a complication of the Periapical<br/>\nabscess situation, facial cellulitis,  that if left any longer without<br/>\ntreatment would almost certainly have become a life threatening � rush to<br/>\nthe ER � situation, and even with antibiotics cannot be let alone<br/>\nindefinitely without becoming a very serious illness with ramifications as<br/>\nfar in advance as possible heart problems in adulthood. We have gotten to it<br/>\nsoon enough to avoid those things, or I am convinced that the doctors would<br/>\nhave scheduled a sooner surgery than a week from Monday � on the 25th.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a number of things that I wish I had done differently. Since the<br/>\nbiggest issue for me was Jayn�s willingness, I wish that I had sought ways<br/>\nto help her come to a willing mindset sooner. Climbing into my time<br/>\nmachine�.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI would have taken Jayn with me to many more, if not all, of my dental<br/>\ncleaning visits rather than just when she was an infant sleeping in her<br/>\nstroller, and the time I went 8 months ago. I would have brought her along<br/>\nto more of James� numerous treatments, just to drop in and become familiar<br/>\nwith dentists, and establish the kind of routine aspect of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI would have sought out the best, kindest full service dentist I could from<br/>\nan earlier age � and I�m pretty sure we would have found this same lady<br/>\nthrough my SIL from the get go � and visited her with Jayn just to<br/>\nacclimatize. My advice would then be less helpful here (g). But the main<br/>\nthing would be taking time without the pressure of urgent worry to find<br/>\nsomeone good and kind and, I say again, full service/all procedures so that<br/>\nif serious stuff is needed the bonds of trust are already there. Her cavity<br/>\nwould have been spotted when tiny and dealt with then, or at any rate sooner<br/>\n- as soon as a willing moment manifested.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nA big part of my bad justifications is that I have a lot of issues about<br/>\nmedical personnel � shitty experiences from my childhood and youth, that<br/>\nlead me to view the nice and good doctors that I meet, and of whom we are<br/>\nall patients, as being the exceptions. Maybe they really are exceptions � I<br/>\nhave managed to meet some distant, superior, scare mongering, uncaring or<br/>\njust not good specialists (and alternative medicine practitioners) in the<br/>\nlast few years also � who got the sack fast. See? I have a lot of distrust<br/>\nof doctors and their motives and their integrity � which is all the more<br/>\nironic as my step father is a wonderful, compassionate doctor and teacher of<br/>\nmedicine. (Some of his less affluent clinic patients pay him in produce from<br/>\ntheir gardens.)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis baggage leads me to want to minimize my contact with doctors beyond the<br/>\nessential � go when you are sick and get a pap smear (not Jayn!)<br/>\nperiodically.  To my shame, what happened here was I didn�t go when the need<br/>\nfirst arose, and now poor Jayn had to pay the price in discomfort.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this specific situation over the last week, what I would have done<br/>\ndifferently is listen to her �no, I want to go home� at once, as I said in<br/>\nthe last post. I tried to cajole and persuade � instead of trusting<br/>\nimmediately that Jayn really did know what she needed, *and* that we were<br/>\ncapable of finding it for her (the Universe providing). This was the worst<br/>\nthing that I did in terms of possible damage to our relationship � a true<br/>\ndeep regret that I have already apologized to Jayn for. She assures me that<br/>\nshe has forgiven me. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would *not* have done is handle either tooth brushing or her free<br/>\ndiet any differently. I am still convinced that she will continue to<br/>\nspontaneously brush her teeth (once she is out of pain and sensitivity) more<br/>\noften than if I were trying to force the issue, and she still instinctively<br/>\ndoes things like drink a bottle of water after eating sweet stuff. She is<br/>\neven getting more into eating cheesy things after sweets.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the grand things that has come from this experience is the renewed<br/>\ngratitude and wonder that I have for my darling James (�dh� is just too<br/>\nsmall to contain my feelings). For all of his expressed worry that we might<br/>\nhave to �make her�, he was just blowing off steam by saying those kind of<br/>\nthings to me in our �How far can we let this go� discussions. When it came<br/>\nto the crunch sitting in a dentist�s office, he was splendid. His forceful<br/>\nand assertive manner with the pushy docs was wonderful. His ability to<br/>\narticulate the philosophy of including Jayn in the decision making process,<br/>\nto their bafflement, while I just looked at them with a slack jaw or<br/>\nmuttered, �That won�t be happening� �.. I�m just overwhelmed to the point of<br/>\nspeechlessness with how fundamentally he �gets it� � and can express it to<br/>\nothers. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
