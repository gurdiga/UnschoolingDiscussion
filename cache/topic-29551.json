I finally learned where all<br/>\nthe US states are a couple of years ago, when we found this game at the<br/>\nthrift store called State to State  that she wanted to play over and<br/>\nover... <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed that Cacie seems to learn what would traditionally be  a few<br/>\nyear&#39;s worth of knowledge  in the schools all at once, or at least in a<br/>\nbig burst. A really simple example - I know that in the state standards<br/>\nfor ths state where we live, they have a standard in 1st grade for adding<br/>\n2 digit numbers with regrouping, then in the 2nd grade it&#39;s 3 digit<br/>\nnumbers, then I think the 4th is 5 digit numbers... maybe the third is<br/>\nwhen they add 3 different multi-digit numbers... I don&#39;t remember<br/>\nexactly, but it was all chopped up. So, Cacie figured out how to add<br/>\nnumbers in her head when she was pretty little, like 4 or 5, and she<br/>\ncould easily add any 2 digit numbers, and if she was motivated she could<br/>\nadd any 3 digit numbers that way, and sometimes she used tricks to do<br/>\nlarger numbers but basically, something like 45,678 + 32,967 would be<br/>\nbeyond what she knew or wanted to attempt. It wasn&#39;t really a problem,<br/>\nexcept for scorekeeping in games, especially games with big number, like<br/>\nLife. But, okay, I scorekept those.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months ago she started getting curious about the way I added the<br/>\nnumbers - the traditional way, carry the tens, all that. She asked me to<br/>\nshow her what I was doing - she already understood the basic idea,<br/>\nbecause she added in her head, so when I explined that this one meant one<br/>\nten, and all that, she got it. Still, writing down anything was not<br/>\nsomething she wanted to be doing, so she never really tried it herself.<br/>\nThen in September, we spent a looong time in an airport, and we were<br/>\nplaying 5 Crowns and she asked to  keep the score. I saw her carefully<br/>\nwriting out the numbers and then adding &quot;my way&quot;, carrying the tens over,<br/>\nrather than doing it all in her head. On the way home, she asked me to<br/>\nwrite some more &quot;plusses&quot; for her to figure out, and I would write 2 or<br/>\n3, and she would gleefully solve them all and ask for bigger ones, harder<br/>\nones. By the end of the trip I was writing 10+ digit numbers for her to<br/>\nadd, and she had it down pat. I also started writing 3 or more numbers<br/>\nfor her to add, to see if she could figure out that sometimes you would<br/>\ncarry a 2, or a 3, and she had no problem with it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here she was at 8, starting out at the beginning of the week doing<br/>\nwhat kids in first grade are expected to do, and ending the week by doing<br/>\nthings a lot of schoolkids her age wouldn&#39;t be able to do. That seems to<br/>\nbe how it goes with a lot of things, she gets interested and learns<br/>\nthings in big chunks.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
