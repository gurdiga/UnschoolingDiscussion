More than this, <br/>\nthough, or drinking regularly, may. Remember that alcohol is a depressant - <br/>\nnot really something you&#39;d want your baby to have :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd &quot;snacking&quot; is certainly not a problem. Remember that breastmilk is more <br/>\nthan just food - it&#39;s also comfort - & *fluid* - very important! If the <br/>\nbaby is having frequent, short nursing sessions, she&#39;s getting lots of <br/>\nforemilk to assuage her thirst.
