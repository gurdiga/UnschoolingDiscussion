It was<br/>\n very intense...visceral.  I felt a connection that was tangible.  ( I am<br/>\n supposed to have a not too distant Native American ancestor but we have not<br/>\n been able to find her...yet)  They were/are beautiful.  Really, the words<br/>\n escape me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand this feeling. I don&#39;t get it so much at any Pow-wows I&#39;ve been to, but I get it very strongly when seeing pictures, movies or reading about the culture. Even the ugly stuff...I just feel this extremely STRONG pull to the Native Americans.<br/>\nMy Dad says we have Lakota blood coursing through our veins, but I thought it was another tribe until this week when he told me. I&#39;m not sure that anyone in the family knows for sure, although my Dad sure looks Native American.<br/>\n<br/>\nI attended a &quot;Ancient Medicines&quot; class last month, in which we started each class with a Native American song and drumming and smudged each other. The sage smudging had a very calming effect on me and when Martha sang and drummed, I got serious chills down my spine (in a good way) I felt like I was home.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76549,"nextTopicId":76427}}
