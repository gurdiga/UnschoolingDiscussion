Because I&#39;m hypoglycemic (low blood sugar), I can <br/>\nfeel when I&#39;m having a problem and need to do something about it right away.  <br/>\nI think for very young children they know something is wrong in how they <br/>\nfeel, but may not know what to do to feel better.  We always have a lot of <br/>\nhigh-fiber and protein foods around for me and the kids to eat.  There are <br/>\nmany days where they really don&#39;t have a lunch but snack throughout the <br/>\nafternoon.  Although being tired, sick, or having fluctuations in their blood <br/>\nsugar can cause children to have melt downs, I feel for very young children, <br/>\nthat changes in their bodies and environment can also affect their behavior.  <br/>\nI have been helping my son go through something that I believe started after <br/>\ngetting his big boy bed.  He wanted a bed and asked for one, but I think it&#39;s <br/>\nbeen an adjustment for him.  I didn&#39;t really put it together until recently, <br/>\nyesterday.  He&#39;s always been a child who tells people what he wants and feels <br/>\nwithout losing it.  Now, everything seems to frustrate him and sets him off.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s no calming him down, talking to him, touching him, or helping him <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s out of control.  I try to see it coming in hopes to help him before <br/>\nit starts, but many times I don&#39;t.  I&#39;ve read in many books that when <br/>\nchildren go through changes, or have achieved certain milestones in their <br/>\ndevelopment, that their behavior may change.  When he&#39;s not out of control <br/>\nand the frustration is over, I talk to him about it.  I cuddle with him.  If <br/>\nthe situation may come up again, I talk to him about it before it comes up. <br/>\n<br/>\nPatti<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":56051484,"authorName":"grlynbl@aol.com","from":"grlynbl@...","profile":"tbb1967","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Have some cheese","postDate":"1044028563","msgId":57380,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdkLjM0ODIxYmQxLjJiNmJmNjkzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":57377,"nextInTopic":57406,"prevInTime":57379,"nextInTime":57381,"topicId":57323,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/31/03 10:52:18 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...

Jon Phillip has &quot;meltdowns&quot; daily.  <br/>\nWell, Ethan does too, actually, but his are not as intense. .. hes grown out <br/>\nof the really intense ones.. JP is just starting to have them.   Anyway, it <br/>\nis a daily challange.. some days worse than others.. I read with much <br/>\ninterest Sandra&#39;s observation of &quot;protein lows&quot; triggering these emotional <br/>\nmeltdowns.  I thought.. hmm, that could be the case here.. JP is a little <br/>\ndude and really doesnt eat a lot of high protein foods.. So, I asked him <br/>\nwhile talking one evening.. &quot;you like cheese dont you?,  I mean, you know, <br/>\nlike little cheese cubes&quot;  He said.. &quot;Oh yeah, I love cheese.. grilled cheese <br/>\nsandwiches too&quot;.  I said.. &quot;Yeah, and that string cheese stick thing you used <br/>\nto pack in your lunch.&quot; &quot;Oh, yeah.. mmmm, I love string cheese too&quot;.  So Anna <br/>\nover hears us talking and asks why am I asking him about cheese.  ( and you <br/>\nknow, I maybe shouldnt even have brought it up to him.. maybe I should have <br/>\njust offered him some cheese the next time he started losing it.. but.. I <br/>\nguess I was sort of talking it out to him)  So, I tell them, that I read that <br/>\nsometimes if your body is not getting enough protien, it makes you feel yucky <br/>\nand maybe feel like you just can&#39;t cope.  Like when JP has his meltdowns.. .. <br/>\nSo, if he is feeling cranky, maybe eating some cheese would help.   They <br/>\nthought it was a good idea ..  So, I bought some cheese snacky stuff.. ( <br/>\ncubes, string cheese, etc).  And when he started spiraling down, I got him <br/>\nsome cheese  ( bear with me, I know this is long)..  Actually, it did seem to <br/>\nhelp him gain control.  Maybe it was the act of taking a break to eat a <br/>\nsnack, or maybe he really was having a low protien moment.. Anyway, hes <br/>\nstarted asking for some cheese when he feels cranky and irritable.  ( which <br/>\nis really just about once a day. maybe twice..).. SO, the funny thing.. Ethan <br/>\nwas getting wound up..  getting upset over his video game or something. .. <br/>\ncrying and fussing and stomping, generally feeling miserable  I was trying to <br/>\nconsole him and get him interested in something else.
