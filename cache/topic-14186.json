But<br/>\n&gt; even if there were, would<br/>\n&gt; that mean unschooling was at fault? Can we blame<br/>\n&gt; *anything* solely on school<br/>\n&gt; or unschooling or mothers or fathers or yellow<br/>\n&gt; underwear or lemonade or<br/>\n&gt; rotton tomatos?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All we can do is our best for our children. I<br/>\n&gt; believe that that means<br/>\n&gt; allowing them them the freedom to make their own<br/>\n&gt; mistakes and learn from<br/>\n&gt; them. Personally, I believe that the more freedom a<br/>\n&gt; person has as a child<br/>\n&gt; (within the bounds of them not harming others), the<br/>\n&gt; less likely they are to<br/>\n&gt; become bad / unhappy / unkind / anti-social /<br/>\n&gt; destrucive people. But then,<br/>\n&gt; my definition of success is to do with lives filled<br/>\n&gt; with generous helpings<br/>\n&gt; of happiness, kindness, creativity, love, joy etc.<br/>\n&gt; But I can&#39;t prove any of<br/>\n&gt; this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If your definition of sucess and failure is to do<br/>\n&gt; with money / position /<br/>\n&gt; power then of course there are unschooling failures.<br/>\n&gt; But I think I know you<br/>\n&gt; better than that, Marianne.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ultimately, our children will have to define success<br/>\n&gt; for themselves. Many of<br/>\n&gt; us have come through our childhoods with a parent&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; definition attached and<br/>\n&gt; have had a dreadful struggle to redefine the<br/>\n&gt; concepts of success, and many<br/>\n&gt; other concepts, for ourselves. Along with with this<br/>\n&gt; hard work there has also<br/>\n&gt; been, for a great many of us, bitterness about what<br/>\n&gt; our parent/s /teacher/s<br/>\n&gt; did to us. This is because we learnt to be ordered<br/>\n&gt; and defined and arranged<br/>\n&gt; by these people, which meant they were to blame when<br/>\n&gt; things went wrong - it<br/>\n&gt; was someone else&#39;s fault. Until we learn to throw<br/>\n&gt; away the blaming, we can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; reach peace or acceptance, nor can we take positive<br/>\n&gt; action.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope, even though my children may chose paths that<br/>\n&gt; I would not have chosen<br/>\n&gt; for them, that they will at least know that it is<br/>\n&gt; their own path, and that<br/>\n&gt; they can choose to change paths at anytime, through<br/>\n&gt; their own thoughts and<br/>\n&gt; actions. That they are responsible for themselves<br/>\n&gt; and their own actions,<br/>\n&gt; thoughts and paths. I have made many mistakes with<br/>\n&gt; my children, but the<br/>\n&gt; biggest mistakes have been when I have tried to make<br/>\n&gt; my children accept me<br/>\n&gt; making decisions and choices for them, have tried to<br/>\n&gt; take responsibility<br/>\n&gt; from them. Still, fortunately, they are all as<br/>\n&gt; stubborn as their mother &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, there&#39;s no &#39;proof&#39; - I think unschooling is<br/>\n&gt; really an act of faith.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a good thing to believe in, IMO.

I believe that that means<br/>\nallowing them them the freedom to make their own mistakes and learn from<br/>\nthem. Personally, I believe that the more freedom a person has as a child<br/>\n(within the bounds of them not harming others), the less likely they are to<br/>\nbecome bad / unhappy / unkind / anti-social / destrucive people. But then,<br/>\nmy definition of success is to do with lives filled with generous helpings<br/>\nof happiness, kindness, creativity, love, joy etc. But I can&#39;t prove any of<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your definition of sucess and failure is to do with money / position /<br/>\npower then of course there are unschooling failures. But I think I know you<br/>\nbetter than that, Marianne.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, our children will have to define success for themselves. Many of<br/>\nus have come through our childhoods with a parent&#39;s definition attached and<br/>\nhave had a dreadful struggle to redefine the concepts of success, and many<br/>\nother concepts, for ourselves. Along with with this hard work there has also<br/>\nbeen, for a great many of us, bitterness about what our parent/s /teacher/s<br/>\ndid to us. This is because we learnt to be ordered and defined and arranged<br/>\nby these people, which meant they were to blame when things went wrong - it<br/>\nwas someone else&#39;s fault. Until we learn to throw away the blaming, we can&#39;t<br/>\nreach peace or acceptance, nor can we take positive action.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope, even though my children may chose paths that I would not have chosen<br/>\nfor them, that they will at least know that it is their own path, and that<br/>\nthey can choose to change paths at anytime, through their own thoughts and<br/>\nactions. That they are responsible for themselves and their own actions,<br/>\nthoughts and paths. I have made many mistakes with my children, but the<br/>\nbiggest mistakes have been when I have tried to make my children accept me<br/>\nmaking decisions and choices for them, have tried to take responsibility<br/>\nfrom them. Still, fortunately, they are all as stubborn as their mother &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, there&#39;s no &#39;proof&#39; - I think unschooling is really an act of faith.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a good thing to believe in, IMO. Feels right to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tonitoni@...\">tonitoni@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; We hear all these tales on how unschooling, and h/s ing has<br/>\n&gt; succeded.
