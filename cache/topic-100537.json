I know<br/>\na lot of people get horses at auction but most of the time they are sent to<br/>\nauction because there is something wrong with them or they have some<br/>\nannoying vice.  Few people would send a great horse to aution.

They need special handling.. they can be great horses when caught young, but they are not for those that are new to horses! They require very secure fencing and special care from someone who is familiar with handling horses. If your family were close to me.. I would gladly welcome a visit and give a few free lessons on my trusty horse Pebbles who is 18.. she is currently being ridden by my 9 yo dd.... the younger the rider the older the horse should be... is a very good thing go by.. just my two cents...<br/>\nJulie in MO</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100235,"nextTopicId":100532}}
