He was a pretty  kitty, and I <br/>\nknow he had a good life with you and Josh.<br/>\n <br/>\nWill&#39;s last hermit crab died yesterday, too.  Hardy the Hermit Crab  from <br/>\nHawaii was the first one we got, in June, 2004.  We got him some  friends, too, <br/>\nand happily painted shells to molt into.  His friends  all passed away one by <br/>\none, and we decided Hardy would have to live a solitary  life.  It was a long <br/>\none for a hermit crab, I think.<br/>\n <br/>\nWill was very excited to take care of him at first, but I did have to give  <br/>\nhim gentle reminders to change the water and put out fresh food, etc., after a  <br/>\nfew months.  One day, while we were getting ready to go on a trip, I  <br/>\ndistractedly stuck my head in the living room and said, &quot;Will, have you talked  to <br/>\nHardy today?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nWithout missing a beat he said, &quot;I tried, but he didn&#39;t want to  talk.&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe all laughed hard and that broke my busy-ness tension, and from then on,  <br/>\nthe gentle reminders came in the form of the same question.  Or, &quot;What did  <br/>\nHardy have to say today?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nWill didn&#39;t cry yesterday, although he felt really bad.  He felt  guilty that <br/>\nhe had been neglecting to play with Hardy and keep his habitat as  clean as <br/>\nin the beginning.  He was consoled by the thought that Hardy lived  so long, so <br/>\nWill must have been doing something right for him.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m glad Josh felt free to cry through his grief.  Will&#39;s not crying  much <br/>\nthese days, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem.  When he came home to  tell me <br/>\nabout the Star Wars movie, he said, &quot;It was really sad.
