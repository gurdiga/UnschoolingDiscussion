They seem to naturally avoid<br/>\ninteraction with certain relatives;  and I let them (and the relative,  if<br/>\nneed be) know that these boundaries are to be respected.<br/>\n    I have an older brother that used to beat me mercilessly,  and &quot;tickle<br/>\ntorture&quot; me (quite literally).  I have not talked this over with my<br/>\nchildren - though I certainly will when they ask about it.  I have worked<br/>\nthrough my own problems about this;  and respect that he has changed in some<br/>\nways...he seems to be trying,  at least.  However,  my children are terribly<br/>\nafraid of him.  They even ask that he not be invited to family gatherings -<br/>\nespecially birthdays...(he like sto do the spanking for each year and a<br/>\npinch to grow an inch).   At any rate,  he&#39;s (my brother) actually beginning<br/>\nto try different ways to relate to my children.  (Don&#39;t get me wrong,  I<br/>\nwould not leave my children around him without one of us parents to<br/>\nintervene for them.)<br/>\n    Anyway,   my point is that,  I do see how my children have to be better<br/>\noff....after all,  I was reared to dis-connect from my own intuition....it&#39;s<br/>\na long road beck to one&#39;s self sometimes.  My children are encouraged to<br/>\nknow and trust their feelings.<br/>\nThanks for the input!<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think this is necessarily so.
