I am not lerning just because i do not pay to<br/>\ngo to a college anymore. and I am not done learning just cus i have a<br/>\nmasters. I will continue to learn. I love learning and I believe that I<br/>\nknow best how to learn and i know what I want to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nyes there are some things kids need to learn but that is up to us as<br/>\nparents to do. and many of them do not have to be in an exact time frame.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling says alot about my priorities in life.
