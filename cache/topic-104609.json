He is so proud of <br/>\nhimself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny to me because the preconcieved notion is that boys &quot;do&quot; <br/>\nthat sort of thing and he never really got into it, while my <br/>\ndaughter (last year 1 1/2) got her first serious road rash from <br/>\nboarding and had to be taken to the hospital.  She has a fantastic <br/>\nscar that will tell quite a few stories when she is older.  I love <br/>\nmy goofy kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoslynn<br/>\nMother to<br/>\nJustice (8)<br/>\nCredence (7)<br/>\nTrinity (2)<br/>\nEpiphany (1)<br/>\nArdor (2 months)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104553,"nextTopicId":104612}}
