I&#39;ve got four kids - 12, 9, 5 and <br/>\n13 months.  This is our second year of homeschooling, but we&#39;ve just recently <br/>\nbegun to venture into unschooling.  Everyone seems much happier when we just <br/>\nkind of go with the flow, and I&#39;ve been okay with it until today.  I happened <br/>\nto run into a lady I know (our kids would be in school together if we weren&#39;t <br/>\nHSing)  and she asked how HSing was going.  I gave her the usual generic <br/>\nspeech I&#39;ve memorized for these occasions.  But it wasn&#39;t enough for her.  <br/>\nShe had question after question, and I&#39;m sorry to say I wasn&#39;t prepared in <br/>\nthe least to answer them.  After talking to her I don&#39;t feel quite as sure of <br/>\nmyself, or of my belief that unschooling is the way to go.  I know, I <br/>\nknow...I&#39;m a wimp.  Really, I don&#39;t want to feel this way.  I want it to be <br/>\ntrue that I&#39;ve finally found a way of life that is comfortable and productive <br/>\nfor my whole family.  My daughter also expressed some doubts today about <br/>\nwhether she&#39;d be &quot;behind&quot; the other kids should she ever decide to go back to <br/>\nschool.  Although I knew the &quot;answer&quot; to her question, I found it very <br/>\ndifficult to articulate it.  Maybe I&#39;m still not confident enough in what I <br/>\nbelieve.  Could it be that I don&#39;t even fully believe that unschooling will <br/>\nwork?  But, I do believe it!  Please help me out here.  Success stories would <br/>\nbe great, especially stories of older kids.  Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nJodye</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7762,"nextTopicId":7767}}
