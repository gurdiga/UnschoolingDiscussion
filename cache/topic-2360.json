It <br/>\nsounds like your dd is ready, and willing to take care of the animals in her <br/>\ncare, and although it might not seem &quot;fair&quot; for her to take all the <br/>\nresponsibility, if she is already doing it... <br/>\nI do know something about goldfish and tropical tanks. How big is the tank? A <br/>\ngood rule of thumb is one inch of fish per gallon. If the goldfish is too big <br/>\nit might be better to take him out. (I would) The reason is this, 1) goldfish <br/>\nare DIRTY and make the Ammonia and Nitrite levels in the tank soar! (You <br/>\ndon&#39;t want this) and 2) goldfish (the fancy ones, not the feeder ones) have <br/>\nbeen bread to grow large, and live in water where temperatures and pH levels <br/>\ndiffer. (This is where you get into trouble with the other tropical fish, <br/>\nbecause normal community fish don&#39;t do well in extreme temps [76 to 82 <br/>\ndegrees is best] or extreme pH levels [anything below 7.0 or above 7.8 and <br/>\nthat can be high for some]) These fancy goldfish or Koi are what people put <br/>\nin their garden ponds. If your daughter wants to get rid of the goldfish (I <br/>\nagree with her) I would call a pet store and ask if they would take him (some <br/>\nwill.

They are posted.  Each week (by choice of the kids), these areas are <br/>\nrotated.  Only the three older childred (8,10,12) take rotations of these <br/>\nchores.<br/>\nDishes are done on a rotation basis, too.  The assigned kitchen person does <br/>\nbreakfast, the three older each do 2 days/wk for lunch and Dad and I always <br/>\ndo supper.<br/>\n The 6 yo does two chores each day...pick-up basket (he goes around putting  <br/>\naway stuff that we all throw into a clothes basket each day when we find <br/>\nsomething on the floor) and sorting out recycling.  The 4 and 2yo basically <br/>\nhelp Mom out with whatever she&#39;s doing, plus pick up their toys.  The 4 yo is <br/>\nstarting to make his own bed, which all of the kids do also.   These younger <br/>\nkids will probably start in the rotation when they are a little older.  Each <br/>\nchild is ready at a different age.  I also expect that by the time the 4yo is <br/>\nready to do laundry, the now 12 yo will be doing more outside of the house <br/>\nand not be as available. BTW, the kids have gotten so good at their chores <br/>\nthat they usually only spend between 20-40 minutes per day doing them. (not <br/>\nincluding dishes!) <br/>\nThen on Saturdays, we have a chore jar and each child picks two or three <br/>\nslips out of the jar and those are his/her chores.  This is when the extra <br/>\nchores (like scrubbing the bathroom floor) get done.<br/>\nWe don&#39;t pay or give rewards for chores, but we do have two areas that we pay <br/>\nthe kids for after they have demonstrated ability and responsibilty:  lawn <br/>\nmowing and babysitting.<br/>\nI (Mom) still do the majority of the heavier cleaning, most of the cooking <br/>\n(although my 12 yog and 10yob do a fair amount on their weeks in the <br/>\nkitchen), errand running, bill paying, ironing, gardening.<br/>\nBecause we have only 2 bedrooms for six kids, the kids are also expected to <br/>\nkeep their bedrooms clean.  Mostly, because their things end up getting <br/>\ntrashed if the rooms are not picked up.  I don&#39;t nag at them about this and <br/>\neach of them have a private space that is not allowed to be handled by any <br/>\noutsiders (especially parents) in which to keep their treasures.<br/>\nThis has worked well for us and we are going into our third year with this <br/>\nschedule.  <br/>\nWe devised this system as a family, after trying many options.  I would like <br/>\nto say we never nag or remind or that the kids always do these things <br/>\nhappily, but that would be a lie.  For the most part, however, they are very <br/>\ncooperative about it.  Whenever they complain, we have a family meeting to <br/>\ndiscuss how to change things, but so far nothing better has really come up, <br/>\nalthough we have refined the system.<br/>\nI&#39;m sure that to some of you, this system will seem too controlling, but we <br/>\nall felt the need for some structure around here before this.  To qualify, I <br/>\nwill say that we are very flexible within these guidelines.  If a child (or <br/>\nan adult) is not feeling well, has another commitment, etc., others either <br/>\npitch in and do their chores or they don&#39;t get done that day (except the <br/>\nessentials like feeding the pets and us!)<br/>\n Sometimes the kids trade without involving me.  Or sometimes they&#39;ll come to <br/>\nme and bargain...For instance...&quot;Mom, since I have soccer practice every <br/>\nnight this week, could my job be to do the supper dishes after I get home <br/>\ninstead of vacuuming?&quot;   <br/>\n  All the kids have worked out their own systems to complete their chores and <br/>\nthey all do them quite differently.  I don&#39;t mess with that. They are also <br/>\nallowed a lot of freedom about when the chores get done, but they&#39;ve all kind <br/>\nof come to their own realization that it&#39;s easiest to do things when they <br/>\nfirst get up, so they don&#39;t have to worry about it later.  I&#39;ve seen a lot of <br/>\nlearning come out of this system.<br/>\nWe tried for years on a just kind of &quot;help as needed&quot; basis, but I think the <br/>\nkids actually resented that more, because it seemed like the kids who were <br/>\nmore &quot;willing&quot; were always the ones &quot;chosen&quot; to help.<br/>\nAgain, this is just our family&#39;s way of doing things, but I thought I&#39;d share <br/>\nbecause you asked!<br/>\nAnd yes, I still consider myself an unschooler!<br/>\nCarol from WI</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"rick and deborah farrington","from":"rick and deborah farrington &lt;honeybee@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"vQtd3TBz5fxfHxcv864eu3A_PMzU-Z3n4KziCX75JeqDLWHAaqID9GnSUsOMgf6reufF3aiTY5g64dfOWQGsGUWVIAq0pqgXK5JZDY_M2_bt_t5FhoRp_DSV","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"chores","postDate":"935797654","msgId":2360,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xNzQuMjM2MC45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2369,"prevInTime":2359,"nextInTime":2361,"topicId":2360,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"thanks Lisa, your testamonie was good. my kids are teens now and its too late! :-( but dd and i came to an agreement on the dishes and bathroom. she hate ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2023405134\">thanks Lisa, your testamonie was good. my kids are teens now and its too<br/>\nlate! :-(<br/>\nbut dd and i came to an agreement on the dishes and bathroom. she hate<br/>\ndishes and i hate bathroom. and i actually like dishes and she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmind bathroom. so we do it this way but i still nag over WHEN the br<br/>\ngets done and i shouldn&#39;t.<br/>\nand ds prefers the outside jobs. so we are in agreement on what we want<br/>\nto do.<br/>\nits just when they get around to doing it. i&#39;m finding i&#39;m just a nag!<br/>\nyikes!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69219,"nextTopicId":69185}}
