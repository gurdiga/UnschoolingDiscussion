I love the reminder that our kids have only spent a few <br/>\nyears on this planet and are still trying to figure things out.

I  think in so many ways parents are conditioned to think of their<br/>\n&gt; kids as  adversaries.  You don&#39;t have to.  You can think of him as  someone<br/>\n&gt; who loves you and needs you a lot right now.  Someone who wants  to be<br/>\n&gt; happy and feel good about himself and his mom.

That sounds harsh but<br/>\nI hope you can think about this in a new way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe  needed you.  For some reason he needed to sit on your lap and be  close<br/>\nto you.  Maybe he had a hard time at your mom&#39;s.  Maybe he  was longing for<br/>\nyou.  Maybe he needed some close time to transition from  the activity at<br/>\nyour mom&#39;s house to  going home.  He needed you and  you decided milk was<br/>\nmore important than what he needed. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if  you&#39;d held him?  What if he was happy after ten minutes.  The<br/>\nmilk  would have been ok.  What if he wanted you to hold him for  forty<br/>\nminutes?   The milk might have still been ok, but what if it  wasn&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you had to go by more milk?  The price of milk is  not greater<br/>\nthan your son&#39;s comfort and happiness. <br/>\nSurely you&#39;ve &quot;wasted&quot;  a few dollars on something that would brighten<br/>\nyour day, a new lipstick or  nail polish or something.  Your son needed a<br/>\nmoment of brightness with  you. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your other son was with you maybe he could have run the  perishables in<br/>\nto your mom&#39;s fridge until you were ready to go.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***I told him that when he hurt my feelings like that it made me not  want<br/>\nto buy him something. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when you hurt his feelings by not  being available to him he didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow what to do.  He reacted like a  three year old who didn&#39;t really know<br/>\nhow to tell his mom he needed some  closeness and comfort. <br/>\n<br/>\n***How should I handle these outbursts of  anger.  This is a new thing for<br/>\nhim in the last couple <br/>\nof  months.***<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to be as understanding as you can.  Try to think  about what led to<br/>\nhim feeling so angry and frustrated.  We all get  angry, and almost no one<br/>\ngets angry for no reason.  See if you can  identify the things that lead<br/>\nto his frustration and head them off.   Listen to him.  He&#39;s trying so<br/>\nhard to communicate with you!  He&#39;s  only had a few years on this planet,<br/>\nspeaking this language and trying to  understand how things work.  He<br/>\nneeds your help when things aren&#39;t going  right.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard to be little and to want to do things a little  body or little<br/>\nhands just aren&#39;t able to do yet.  It&#39;s hard to not be  able to express<br/>\nyourself in terms other people clearly understand and  respect.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he&#39;s tired and needs some quiet time in the  rocking chair with you.<br/>\nMaybe he&#39;s out of energy and needs a snack.  He  might not recognize the<br/>\nsymptoms of those things and so, can&#39;t express that  to you.  <br/>\nMaybe he wants some sympathy when things are going wrong.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard being a mom and especially a mom who&#39;s trying so hard<br/>\nto  get everything right.  If you can remember he isn&#39;t trying to hurt<br/>\nyour  feelings or make your life harder, he&#39;s just trying to communicate<br/>\nsome need  or problem he has and he doesn&#39;t have all the skills to do that<br/>\nyet.  If  you can think about that it will help you be more patient with<br/>\nhim.  He  wants to be happy and he wants you to be happy with him.  Our<br/>\nsociety  portrays kids as working against their parents and it just isn&#39;t<br/>\nso.  I  think in so many ways parents are conditioned to think of their<br/>\nkids as  adversaries.  You don&#39;t have to.  You can think of him as  someone<br/>\nwho loves you and needs you a lot right now.  Someone who wants  to be<br/>\nhappy and feel good about himself and his mom.  If you think of  the<br/>\nsituation as both of you having the same goal you can work with him  to<br/>\nfind solutions instead of feeling like your working against him.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95632,"nextTopicId":94937}}
