We talked about kindergarden before school started, offered him the options.  He decided to go, and LOVES it.  Some days he doesn&#39;t want to go after lunch and I offer him to stay home, NO WAY...   He likes the bus ride, all the activities, seems to thrive with structure (MUST come from daddy :-)  ) but knows that when he&#39;s tired of it all, he&#39;ll be able to stay home.  Even the &quot; We could go there during the week&quot; bribes don&#39;t work YET... BUT we&#39;re starting to have downsides, he got pushed this week in the school yard, getting rushed in the morning, etc..   I&#39;m hoping he&#39;ll get the point soon...   I don&#39;t want to go the whole nine yards and making school icky, since all his friends are going, I just want to let him know things for lucky him, can be better than that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Genevieve<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":87403280,"authorName":"Jeff & Kate Kerr","from":"Jeff & Kate Kerr &lt;windystreet@...&gt;","profile":"saffronwoman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Respecting children&#39;s choices","postDate":"1035143195","msgId":47011,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEQjMwODE4LjFGNUM2OTNCQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":46970,"nextInTopic":47015,"prevInTime":47010,"nextInTime":47012,"topicId":5481,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Personally, I would think very long and hard about sending your daughter to school.

Some one a while ago posted about changing their<br/>\nattitude about schooling.  Going from the belief that it was necessary<br/>\nand must always be attended, to knowing that her daughter/son could<br/>\nunschool in school by not thinking of it as mandatory (I think I got it<br/>\nright).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we did when our 5 yod decided that she wanted to go to kindergarten<br/>\nwas to let her go.  It was scary for us, because unlike most people who<br/>\nknow their child is going to school, we knew our children were going to<br/>\nbe unschooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nI posted here asking people what I should do with a child who wants to<br/>\ngo to school and the best advice I got was let her go, she probably<br/>\nwon&#39;t like it anyway.  I decided that I would treat her being in K as an<br/>\nunschooler going to school - that is only when she chooses.  She chose<br/>\none day, walked out after class and announced she was bored with it<br/>\n(only got to read one book, no coloring, etc....  Not up to her<br/>\nstandards).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe now happily unschools with us.  Her one day in K is talked about<br/>\noccasionally, mostly by her or her brother who, as reluctant as he is to<br/>\nadmit it, is glad she&#39;s not going anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I say things like, &quot;Aren&#39;t you glad we can go to the zoo on a<br/>\nTuesday?&quot;  or &quot;Isn&#39;t it great to go swimming in the morning with no<br/>\nbigger kids splashing us?&quot;  She gets it.

You don&#39;t have to wait until the school year has ended to begin homeschooling.  I had thought it was the better thing to do.  To wait.  Let her experience the whole year of kindergarten.  What a doofus.

My son is very introverted, shy, sensitive, whereas my daughter is extremely extroverted, bubbly, and never meets someone who isn&#39;t happy to see her.  :)  We cannot even go to the store without her (from the age of 1 1/2--blowing kisses) and saying goodbye to each one of the checkout people.

We did let our daughter go to kindergarten last year and I wish we hadn&#39;t.  She was a very good beginning reader before she went and it wasn&#39;t long before she decided &quot;I just cannot read&quot;.  I think it was because there were others who could read better than her.  She is just now beginning to show interest again and I am trying my best to let her go at her own pace.  She is very bright and her kindergarten teacher was very impressed with her vocabulary (I use a lot of &#39;big&#39; words and so it seems does my daughter), and I believe she was (according to their standards), about 2nd or 3rd in a class of 20 kids.  She was reading at 1.8 grade level (so says their computer program they use) but if you ask the child to read a book with you, she will look at you and state clearly &quot;I don&#39;t know how to read yet.&quot;   She does know some words but being that we are perfectionists, she won&#39;t attempt it in public until she masters it.  She is also not yet riding her bike without training wheels and is down on herself for that.  She did not have such strong feelings about &#39;failure&#39; or &#39;perfomance&#39; or even &#39;perfection&#39; until she went to public school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I am not saying that your daughter will pick up these attitudes in her kindergarten, but my little girl was quite self confident before school and just after one year (really more like a few months) she had lost much of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would try to make sure she has a few playmates, but I don&#39;t think school is the answer just because you have a social child.  My daughter has a couple of good friends who both go to school.  Somedays it is hard to wait until they get home to play, but we do plenty of things together during the day so that she doesn&#39;t really have time to be sad about missing them.  She wouldn&#39;t see them at school anyway.....different grades and different schools.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt; I do realise that she is still two and a half years away, and she might not, but I was wondering if anyone has had that experience and how they handled it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDalene&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThankfully you have plenty of time to do your research and find out what might be right for your family.
