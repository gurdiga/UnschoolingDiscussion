Sorry, I <br/>\n&gt; must <br/>\n&gt; have missed that. And I think Joyce made the remark that maybe she want&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; interact but doesn&#39;t know how to go about it. Also when you said that the <br/>\n&gt; kids aren&#39;t quite as vocal and such as she is, maybe she does want to play <br/>\n&gt; but just doesn&#39;t get the kind of response she&#39;s looking for. That mixed <br/>\n&gt; with <br/>\n&gt; boredom, again from not getting what she wants can add up to just kicking <br/>\n&gt; someone out of frustration of it all. I can understand that. Maybe trying <br/>\n&gt; some older kids would help.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My Sierra happens to get along great with kids her age and older kids too <br/>\n&gt; but just loves ones a bit younger than her. She has this mother thing she <br/>\n&gt; does and plays really well with 4 and 5 year olds. My son and youngest <br/>\n&gt; happen to like older kids more so but still get along great with kids the <br/>\n&gt; same age or younger. It just seems like a preference they have right now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll figure it out in no time with all the great advice flying <br/>\n&gt; around here.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let us know how it goes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mary B<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15277,"nextTopicId":47896}}
