To put the cookies on a low shelf, a kid who has<br/>\nto &quot;become&quot; Eminem/2 Live Crew/Elvis in order to fit into the<br/>\nsociety he spends his waking hours inhabiting is very different<br/>\nfrom a kid who can listen, take what he wants and back out when<br/>\nit isn&#39;t what he wants.  For a while we had to put kids into day<br/>\ncare - and I had to be much more limiting about choices, simply<br/>\nbecause the competition even at young ages to sound and look like<br/>\nBrittany was more than was healthy for a developing individual -<br/>\nnow I try to know what they are &#39;into&quot; but it is more so that I<br/>\ncan stay a half a thought ahead of what will come next rather<br/>\nthan trying to &quot;undo&quot; damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, folks, go outside!  We christened the 7 week old Sunday,<br/>\ninvolving all the kith and kin coming up to visit and a grand<br/>\nbrunch.  The 6 asked me as we were driving to town how big a germ<br/>\nwas.  Now she had asked me before and I had promised to look it<br/>\nup with her, when &quot;Teeny tiny, too small to see&quot; was not a<br/>\nsufficient answer.  Caught with my research down, I suggested she<br/>\nask her Papaw, who is a doctor.  We got to their hotel room and<br/>\naway she went asking.  His answer was prompt - &quot;about 2 microns<br/>\nor 1/4th the size of a red blood cell.&quot;  That of course begged<br/>\nthe question of how big a micron is; he obligingly held out his<br/>\narms &quot;about&quot; 39 inches apart and said 1 millionth of this.  Now<br/>\nshe has the vocabulary of numbers to know what a million is, but<br/>\nvery few of us can really get our minds around all those zero&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo after the party, I was pondering this issue and went outside.<br/>\nHave I mentioned, &quot;Go outside&quot;?  We have a property line that is<br/>\nabout 1,000 feet long - wander around where you are, you can find<br/>\na good long line like that somewhere.  Now I needed to know what<br/>\nwas 1/1000th of a foot - so I calculated it up and put that<br/>\nnumber into Google as the only search term - turns out that we<br/>\nhad some sheet copper around that was pretty darn close.  So we<br/>\ntook a meter stick and the copper mask (the sheet copper had been<br/>\nused, LOL) and went out on an adventure - a micron is to this<br/>\nmeter stick as this piece of copper is to that property line.<br/>\nKinesthetic Kate has walked the line a couple of times in the<br/>\nlast two days and has tried laying the edge of the mask down into<br/>\nthe dirt to count how many times to make even an inch.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat micron exploration has been broken up mainly by the fact<br/>\nthat we had a fruit salad in a watermelon bowl carved to look<br/>\nlike a baby cradle for the Christening.  Far too pretty according<br/>\nto the kidlets to just compost.  So the 2 got his first hammering<br/>\nproject.  The woodpile is in the process of being shifted for the<br/>\nwinter&#39;s fuel, moving the last year leftovers to the side mainly<br/>\nto become mulching, but some are still burnable.  I found a<br/>\ncouple of pieces that were still solid and that had a good flat<br/>\nside, then handed him a fist full of finishing nails and a<br/>\nhammer.  With a little help, he got a bunch of the nails into the<br/>\nwood far enough for our purposes.  We cut the watermelon cradle<br/>\ninto chunks (about 4 inches square) and stuck them on the nails<br/>\nyummy side up, then set the whole she-bang on the deck rail<br/>\noutside the dining room bay window (that&#39;s the window with the<br/>\ntelescopes and binoculars).  We had a constant parade of<br/>\nbutterflies and hummers, leading to a constant parade to the<br/>\nfield guides to identify then.  By dark, all of the red had been<br/>\neaten away and we brought the contraption back in for refilling<br/>\nthis morning with more of the Christening cradle become butterfly<br/>\nfeeder activity... and somewhere along about 2:30 today, that<br/>\nsame lovely 6 asked me if we had any math workbooks laying around<br/>\nshe could play with.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42241,"nextTopicId":42186}}
