They are <br/>\nharping about him so much, and the fact that the only thing he is interested <br/>\nin is science fiction or computer games, and they are constantly telling me <br/>\nthat I am hurting my child.  I am coming to this group, my only group of <br/>\nsupport for unschooling, and begging for encouragement.  I am wanting all you <br/>\nveteran unschoolers to tell me that it is okay if he is not motivated, and <br/>\nthat we should just continue to unschool like we are.  <br/>\n     I am really sorry, if I made anyone feel like I wanted answers on a <br/>\ncurriculum, or if I made you feel like I was discussing traditional <br/>\nschooling.

Why. That answer would be different depending on which<br/>\nchild I was talking about. But what it would come down to in the end is<br/>\nthat I trust their abilities/desires enough to let them learn what they<br/>\nchoose to.  I also respect them enough as individuals not to choose for<br/>\nthem what should be important for them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my children left school we had a lot of things to sort out. First was<br/>\nwhat each of us felt was education. The one thing we all agreed on was that<br/>\nthe &quot;subjects&quot; were too narrowly defined by the system and produced<br/>\n(hopefully if the students memorized it all and retained it) cookie cutter<br/>\ngraduates.   Once we realized that, then we had to look at how much of what<br/>\nwas taught in school was needed. Of course math is needed daily, but we<br/>\nknew that it could be learned in a better way.  A way that would stay with<br/>\nus and rote memorization wasn&#39;t it. <br/>\n<br/>\nonce we found unschooling we realized just how little we had known when we<br/>\nfigured out the above questions in the beginning.  The boys were shocked to<br/>\nlearn how much more was out there that they hadn&#39;t had time to learn when<br/>\nsitting in a classroom.  I was at first surprised by how much I could learn<br/>\nfrom them. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, (to keep this from getting too long) I wanted my children to<br/>\nregain the self esteem that they originally had when I sent them off to<br/>\nschool.

It&#39;s <br/>\nokay, the goal is not to put them in your child&#39;s head.  My kids use <br/>\nworkbooks and puzzle books to learn with. Matter of fact my oldest is so dang <br/>\nmethodical she drive me nutty.  Living with me has been hard on her.  She&#39;s <br/>\nused tons of workbooks, whether they were produced to be curriculum or just <br/>\nfun stuff for kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what Sandra and Linda were really pointing out is not the use of any <br/>\none kind of material, but the little nagging issue of control.  It&#39;s very <br/>\nhard to give up control ...over anything that has meaning in our lives.  And <br/>\nsociety has pounded into our heads that our children are out of control and <br/>\nif we don&#39;t maintain a tight grip things are just going to get worse.  Teach <br/>\nthem is an issue of control in the way the larger society uses the word to <br/>\nmean to force someone to learn something.. So, some of us react to that word <br/>\nin ways that seem out of proportion. I know that Sandra and I have had many <br/>\ndiscussions that centered around the word *teach*.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiving deeply into just what we are doing is what I hope we do on this list.  <br/>\nThere are many lists that discuss the how of unschooling. How kids learn math <br/>\nby cooking and how grammar and vocabulary are logical outgrowths of reading <br/>\nand speaking.  The why we choose this path, the why isn&#39;t discussed as much.  <br/>\nI think we who are living daily with the different kind of how need to <br/>\nobserve, discuss, and analyze why what we are doing is working so well.  In <br/>\nthe coming years there are going to be an awful lot of people coming to us <br/>\nand asking us how they can recreate what we have discovered on a larger <br/>\nscale. If we aren&#39;t conversent with the why, the whole culture loses out.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortuately, asking those why questions can be tricky. It sounds accusatory <br/>\nto say, &quot;why did you do that?&quot;.  This medium can also be a drawback, without <br/>\nbody language and tones of voice to guide us, it&#39;s very easy to read a snarky <br/>\nattitude into what really was just a genuine question.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some deep thinkers on this list and I, for one, hope they feel safe <br/>\nin posing and talking about these issues.  While it may feel uncomfortable at <br/>\nfirst, especially if you are new to unschooling, in the long run these <br/>\ndiscussions will make us all stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Bugg<br/>\nps....

This<br/>\nsort of thing can help people to relax and butt out, so to<br/>\nspeak.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to clarify this.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSandy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skeane@...\">skeane@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mypage.direct.ca/s/skeane/\">http://mypage.direct.ca/s/skeane/</a><br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nSummer Haiku<br/>\n<br/>\nSmell of glove leather,<br/>\ngrassy stains and diamond dust,<br/>\ngreen cathedrals......life.        -sk<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@xxx.xxx","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"u3rBlkJNi6Nt0jrQrpl5HndgKT2y-k_czjU-HsrZRf5I5fdqMFD7X3bXvN_E7aEPNRjW1DBZEpUO","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling itself, a list and a forum","postDate":"928992543","msgId":896,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy43MC44OTYuOTU5MjY5NzQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":895,"nextInTopic":898,"prevInTime":895,"nextInTime":897,"topicId":870,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/9/1999 8:14:32 PM, hilinda@lightlink.com wrote: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1344870249\">In a message dated 6/9/1999 8:14:32 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hilinda@...\">hilinda@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It&#39;s this sort of language we need to be very aware of and careful about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m far more interested in the ways in which people learn than in how<br/>\nanything &quot;can be taught&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne good way to discover and weed out some of our school-based thinking is to <br/>\nreplace all phrases using &quot;teach&quot; with phrases using &quot;learn.&quot;   Learning is <br/>\nan absolute.  Teaching is very abstract and once removed from action.  <br/>\n&quot;Teaching&quot; is no more than talking about something, or demonstrating it, or <br/>\nanswering questions about it.  It is possible to talk to a fence post, <br/>\ndemonstrate to the wall, or answer questions which were left in writing by <br/>\nsomeone who is a thousand miles away now (physically or mentally).  <br/>\n&quot;Teaching&quot; has no object, really.  Teaching is song and dance, possibly <br/>\nwithout an audience.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;LEARNING,&quot; though is an entirely solid-state, tangible matter.  Inside the <br/>\nlearner real connections are being made.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother analogy in the &quot;been there, done that&quot; category:  Women need to be <br/>\nempowered to make their own informed decisions about pregnancy, childbirth, <br/>\nand nursing.  Even now, I&#39;ll hear a woman say, &quot;My doctor won&#39;t let me [do <br/>\nwhatever]&quot; or &quot;My doctor says I can&#39;t go out of town.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nI correct them gently, every time. I just rephrase:  &quot;You mean your doctor <br/>\nrecommends that you stay in town?&quot;   If they&#39;re resistent to the gentle <br/>\nshift, if they don&#39;t get what I&#39;m saying, I might say something stronger, <br/>\nlike &quot;Is it the doctor&#39;s baby?&quot;  or  &quot;Why did you give the doctor the power <br/>\nto tell you what to do?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the same with education, the state, the school district, and teaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf pregnant-you says (and thinks) &quot;My doctor won&#39;t let me eat bananas&quot; it <br/>\nwill affect your self image, your freedom, your power, and your attitude <br/>\ntoward the ownership of the unborn baby.   If an aspiring unschooler says and <br/>\nbelieves, &quot;The state makes me...&quot; or &quot;The district says we have to...&quot; then <br/>\nyou might as well get a curriculum.  If doing what you think a school <br/>\nadministrator &quot;requires&quot; is more important to you than empowering your child <br/>\nto learn and empowering yourself to support and protect his learning <br/>\nenvironment then unschooling might not be possible for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch of this is attitude and confidence and self-assurance.   If you believe <br/>\nin theory that unschooling can work and you DO IT, and it works, you will <br/>\nconfidently continue.  If you believe it but you don&#39;t try it, how can you <br/>\ncontinue?  How can you have seconds if you haven&#39;t had firsts??<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t believe it will work and you claim you tried it and it didn&#39;t <br/>\nwork, how could you have given it a fair trial if you never really took a <br/>\ndeep breath and jumped off that cliff?  If you were standing holding on to <br/>\nthe teaching-branch on the edge of the cliff and just dangled your kid over <br/>\nthe edge and then brought him back and said &quot;it didn&#39;t work,&quot; you haven&#39;t <br/>\nunschooled.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSummertime is a good time for trial unschooling.  If summer isn&#39;t supposed to <br/>\nbe learning time and kids learn a ton, why change anything when September <br/>\ncomes?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Hsmotgo@xxx.xxx","from":"Hsmotgo@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"su5y4c4AieO-jREWDfDYps21zJ4KoOT0XqNWWqSdPkZyIPTnuV_Jmq9tZFIV52q9jV4vtCgr","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling itself, a list and a forum","postDate":"928990414","msgId":895,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy43MC44OTUuOTU5MjY5NzQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":894,"nextInTopic":896,"prevInTime":894,"nextInTime":896,"topicId":870,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/9/99 12:54:03 PM EST, SandraDodd@AOL.COM writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-625473575\">In a message dated 6/9/99 12:54:03 PM EST, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; There are lots of people on this list and I&#39;m glad of it &gt;&gt;<br/>\nSandra, <br/>\nWith all due respect, I don&#39;t personally know you, or your credentials, but, <br/>\nas a homeschooling mom, wanting and needing a place to share, I think this <br/>\nlist is great, and should be left as it is.

But if you <br/>\npress your children into a school-style form and decide on your success and <br/>\nfailure based on what the schools claim to be doing with and for children the <br/>\nage your child is, it will be hard to give yourself the leeway to accept your <br/>\nchild&#39;s own pace, his own starts and lulls and frenzies and fallow seasons.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it will be more beneficial to those starting to unschool to hear how <br/>\nthey can do without a curriculum than to go to websites dedicated to the sale <br/>\nof things they don&#39;t need in order to unschool and which might, in fact, keep <br/>\nthem from unschooling successfully.   As surely as formula feeding &quot;just half <br/>\nthe time&quot; will sabotage a  nursing relationship between mother and baby, <br/>\nusing a curriculum for some subjects and not others will ruin the integrity <br/>\nof unschooling.  A child whose parents don&#39;t really commit to unchooling can <br/>\nreceive the message that reading or math is REALLY important and couldn&#39;t <br/>\npossibly be left up to him to learn for fun, but that science and music and <br/>\nhistory and poetry are disposable and unnecessary and he can learn them or <br/>\nnot.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s my concern.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"::she just is::","from":"&quot;::she just is::&quot; &lt;OmegaMolecule@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"SWIO-05X1TPcYPySW-cqyN6ZBYlloz685nVaAJTxNooKIOS97d4p7dNftPrxGjlpjpRcTHCLN2FgadQXVbEe7Ztss2xJxhmsMbdDJZj1tmjPvVcTD0c","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling itself, a list and a forum","postDate":"928959477","msgId":876,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy42OS44NzYuOTU5MjY5NzQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":870,"nextInTopic":884,"prevInTime":875,"nextInTime":877,"topicId":870,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"No, you re making a lot of sense, Sandra.
