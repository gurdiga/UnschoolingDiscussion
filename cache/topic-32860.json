I also believe that not everyone experiences the same <br/>\nresponse to unschooling, therefore your statement cannot apply to <br/>\neveryone. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have had personal experience with a child who does need an <br/>\nexternal structure.  Unschooling was my desire - I (the parent)did <br/>\nnot have the need for structure.  Unschooling was a disaster for my <br/>\ndaughter.  It made her edgy and upset.  She hated it.  She created <br/>\nher own school plan and it was very harsh and demanding.  I had to <br/>\nstep in before she had a nervous breakdown.  She also hates open <br/>\nended questions.  She is a perfectionist and she has always been <br/>\nhard on herself.  She has wonderful loving parents who have not done <br/>\nanything to cause her to be this way.  It is just the way she has <br/>\nalways been.  She spilled a glass of milk when she was 2 and became <br/>\nquite hysterical.  People watching probably erroneously assumed that <br/>\nher parents had been overly harsh in the past when she spilled <br/>\nthings. The truth is that she had never accidently spilled anything <br/>\nbefore.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is now 14 and studying Classical Literature.  She is reading and <br/>\nenjoying things that would put me to sleep.  She did fine from <br/>\nSeptember until January.  When she started showing signs of stress, <br/>\nI stepped in and asked her to take some time off.  She refused <br/>\nsaying that she needed to finish what she had scheduled.  I found <br/>\nsome light, fun reading choices and put those on her schedule <br/>\ninstead.  She thanked me and hugged me with tears in her eyes.  I <br/>\nhave spent most of her homeschooling years running similar <br/>\ninterferences.  I also spend a great deal of time telling her how <br/>\nwonderful she is as a human being and that studying hard does not <br/>\nmake me love her more.  I know that some will read what I have <br/>\nwritten and choose not to believe me.  I can&#39;t help that; all I can <br/>\nsay is &quot;you have not walked in my shoes.&quot;  Please do not judge what <br/>\nyou have not experienced. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlaura </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling or not?","postDate":"1016640299","msgId":32860,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFiLjE4ZDcwMmQ1LjI5Y2EwZDJiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":32862,"prevInTime":32859,"nextInTime":32861,"topicId":32860,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 03/19/2002 11:53:02 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

As my son gets older, I am finding <br/>\nhe&#39;s added more structure to how and what he wants to learn. Even in a young <br/>\nchild, an aware parent can recognize the child&#39;s need or desire for some <br/>\nstructure in the day -- whether it&#39;s around a specially-enjoyed tv show, a <br/>\nstory before bed, or regular meals. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe question is whether a child--any child-- needs school-like or other <br/>\nexternally demanded structure. I really believe the need for that structure <br/>\nis the parent&#39;s need, not the child&#39;s. Some children may feel safer or more <br/>\ncomfortable with a regular rhythm to their days, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the <br/>\nsame as requiring specific learning activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that many families who unschool have a great deal of structure. <br/>\nOnly some families have free-flowing days. If you have a kid who&#39;s a <br/>\npassionate dancer and his classes are at certain times, that&#39;s structure. If <br/>\nyou live in a rural area and it makes sense to go to the library on the same <br/>\nday that you grocery shop, that&#39;s structure too. <br/>\n<br/>\nA child who wants more structured learning will create it. Or an observant <br/>\nparent can mention, &quot;I noticed that you really enjoyed studying bugs in that <br/>\nstructured way. What captured your interest so much? Are you interested in <br/>\nlearning other things that way, or was it specific to that topic?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI really do believe that unschooling can work for any kid, but not <br/>\nnecessarily every parent. Or even every parent with every kid. It can be hard <br/>\nto let go of our worries and panics, and we often ascribe them to our <br/>\nchildren rather than ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister, who adores her children, would be a terrible homeschooler. She <br/>\nworries ALL the time, and has a challenging son, who is really smart, spacey, <br/>\nsweet, weird, lovely, and magical. She and Sean would drive each other nuts <br/>\nwithin a week. Cheryl sends him to a local public school and volunteers for <br/>\nmany hours a week, both in his classroom and in others. I think Sean would <br/>\nshine brilliantly unschooled, but it would never work for their family. (I <br/>\njust sent Cheryl Grace Llewellyn&#39;s new book, Guerilla Learning.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32775,"nextTopicId":32923}}
