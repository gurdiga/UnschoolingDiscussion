I have spoken up many times when I &quot;should&quot; have ducked.  I told a colleague at my new job about it as we worked side by side and she was appalled at first.  But I hung in there because I KNOW it is logical and I KNOW it&#39;s right.  Now she&#39;s pretty cool with me.  Ah well.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand I have provoked a friend whose 1st baby is due in 20-some days that he must not send the child to school.  He listens.  He wants excellence in his child and I kept asking him how he was going to ensure that, why he was going to learn it up the &quot;System&quot;?  His wife wants to be home with baby, so I think they may make it work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, ... if I&#39;m always ducking, I don&#39;t get a genuine life!!!  You too I think, eh, Nanc?<br/>\n<br/>\nGot the book &quot;Fierce Conversations&quot; thru Inter-Library loan and read the first 10 pages last night - Excellent! - and right on this rant topic.  The idea there is that we build our lives and our reality one conversation at a time.  And if they are not fierce, then life becomes a lie.  Does that fit, Nanc?<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you keep it up!

She was not   amused.<br/>\nI often feel with regular school-at-home type HSers that I must not mention <br/>\nthe joys of unschooling my children, that they feel very threatened by it.One <br/>\nwoman was asking me about unschooling and kept coming back to her concern about <br/>\nretaining Authority over her children. What is with this????<br/>\nI want to be an advocate for unschooling, yet am not comfortable really <br/>\ntalking about it to these other homeschoolers because it seems to freak them out. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Any one else go thru this?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79108,"nextTopicId":79122}}
