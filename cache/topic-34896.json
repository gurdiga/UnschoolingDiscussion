I&#39;m new<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi! I&#39;m Valerie<br/>\nWe are new to unschooling but have been homeschooling for 7 years. One<br/>\nyear I lost my head and taught at a private school for tuition so my<br/>\nchildren could attend. Anyway, I won&#39;t go into that.<br/>\nWe live in Camp LeJeune, NC. My DH is a Navy man of 14 years.<br/>\nI have 3 kids, dd 14, dd 11, ds 9.<br/>\nI have always tried to get around NOT doing some of our workbooks and I<br/>\nnever felt good about going over the same material over and over again.<br/>\nAnyway, I know you have heard the same thing from others. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m<br/>\nquite typical.<br/>\nI have been lurking for most of the day.<br/>\nI have a little opinion on the TV issue. Well, there are many rabbit<br/>\ntrails on here about them. :O)<br/>\nI just wanted to introduce myself before I jumped in! :O)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about suicide bombers lately and I<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; to wonder what happens to make them willing to do that?  How desperate<br/>\n&gt; do their lives have to be?  How much have they lost hope that things<br/>\n&gt; can improve?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what we have learned the bombers don&#39;t believe that their lives are<br/>\ndesperate, bad or lacking in any way. They find that the Western culture<br/>\nwith all of it&#39;s modernization and frills is very evil, as well as any<br/>\nmodernization on that side of the world.<br/>\nStarvation is considered the norm and violence is a part of their<br/>\nreligion.<br/>\nThey kill themselves because they are taught that this life has no value<br/>\nwhatsoever and paradise awaits them when they discard their earthly<br/>\nflesh. When they murder innocent people they believe that they are being<br/>\nmerciful to those people by ending their corrupted lives. These bombers<br/>\nare taught from their earliest youth that the only reason they are alive<br/>\nis to die in &quot;Holy Jihad&quot; and to be with Allah very soon.<br/>\nNotice that the bombers are very young, most not even in their 30&#39;s. I<br/>\nthink that their government has intensified it&#39;s teachings of Holy Jihad<br/>\nin the last couple of decades.<br/>\nThe Navy is serving the Detainees and POW&#39;s in Camp X-Ray. My husband is<br/>\nattached to the fleet hospital down there. He didn&#39;t have to go as he<br/>\nwas with Division at the time the hospital moved down there and he was<br/>\n&quot;left behind&quot; (though he stands a 50/50 right now of having to deploy in<br/>\nSeptember for the change over.) The docs that come back are telling us<br/>\nhow young the detainees are. The average age is 15. Their lives were so<br/>\nrugged that they can&#39;t believe the excellent treatment they are getting<br/>\nin Camp X-ray!<br/>\nThey have never known what medical care really is! Needless to say,<br/>\nquite a few claim to defect. But I don&#39;t believe it. They are so<br/>\nbrainwashed into the Jihad thing, it will take a lot to turn around that<br/>\npowerfully evil teaching.<br/>\nAnyway, don&#39;t want to get off on a tangent. :O) But this is an<br/>\ninteresting subject and my children and I have been following since<br/>\nSept. 11 as closely as possible.<br/>\nThanks for letting me share.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br/>\n.· ´¨¨))  -:¦:-<br/>\n           ¸.·´ .·´¨¨))<br/>\n        ((¸¸.·´   .·´   -:¦:-Valerie Cifuentes<br/>\n      -:¦:-    ((¸¸.·´*<br/>\nI CAN NO LONGER ACCEPT FORWARDS, CHAIN LETTERS AND PETITIONS.

Maybe the media is just bringing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things to our attention now.  I know it seems like there&#39;s a lot more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sexual abuse of children going on nowadays, but it was happening in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; early 1900s when my mother was little.

If there&#39;s a body, or even when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone goes missing, it gets reported and investigated.  I can see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something like rape going unreported, because women are afraid of how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they&#39;ll be treated by the courts, etc.  I can even see how B & Es might go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unreported, if people think nothing will be done.

A short excerpt:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Similar concern over violence presented as entertainment was felt a century <br/>\nearlier. Rising juvenile crime rates from the mid to late nineteenth century <br/>\ncoincided with an increase in working-class literacy and the growing <br/>\navailability of &#39;penny dreadfuls&#39;, which were widely read by adolescent boys. <br/>\nUsually sold in penny instalments (hence the title) these publications gave <br/>\nthe juvenile reader a weekly diet of murder, mystery and mayhem with a <br/>\nsmattering of piracy and highway robbery thrown in for good measure. They <br/>\nwere one of the earliest forms of literature to target children directly inste<br/>\nad of via their parents, catering for adolescent boys&#39; tastes at a price they <br/>\ncould easily afford. Parents could not be sure their children did not read <br/>\npenny dreadfuls any more than modern parents can be sure their children do <br/>\nnot watch violent videos. From the mid-nineteenth century onwards penny <br/>\ndreadfuls provided an easy scapegoat for virtually all male juvenile crime. <br/>\nMuch of the concern came from clergymen, journalists and magistrates (18), <br/>\nwho seem to have assumed that the penny dreadful readership was almost <br/>\nentirely young, working-class and male, exactly the audience that <br/>\ntwentieth-century commentators consider most at risk from the &#39;bad influence&#39; <br/>\nof video nasties.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n:)  The more things change ...<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, if anyone is interested in reading a &quot;penny dreadful&quot; or two, Standford <br/>\nhas put the text of several of them online, out of their enormous collection. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/dp/pennies/texts/dimes_toc.html\">http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/dp/pennies/texts/dimes_toc.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3977724,"authorName":"squeaksoup@aol.com","from":"squeaksoup@...","profile":"squeaksoup","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] TV is bad","postDate":"1018928794","msgId":34998,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI0LjIzZjY0NDhhLjI5ZWNmODlhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34957,"nextInTopic":35002,"prevInTime":34997,"nextInTime":34999,"topicId":34896,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/15/2002 1:43:20 PM, jnjstau@gvtc.com writes:  I ve not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1967216128\">In a message dated 4/15/2002 1:43:20 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jnjstau@...\">jnjstau@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; .why are crime<br/>\nrates down and continuing to drop, particularly violent crime? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve not seen these stats.

If your house is burglarized, not all<br/>\npolice agencies will send someone out to take a report.  They will advise<br/>\nthe homeowner to come in and fill out a form.  Lots of people won&#39;t do that,<br/>\nthey just let it slide.  If an officer is called out on a dv and all he does<br/>\nis arrest one of the parties on a drunk in public, it doesn&#39;t go down in the<br/>\nrecord as a dv.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a couple of years ago, where we live now, this was brought to the<br/>\nattention of the police force at the convention that was held at the local<br/>\nuniversity.  Our crime stats are astrinomical because absolutely everything<br/>\nwas being reported and an officer was sent out on absolutely every call<br/>\ndispatch received.  Also, if dispatch received a call as dv, even if no<br/>\npolice action was taken.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jnjstau@...\">jnjstau@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 15, 2002 10:01 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] TV is bad<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Everyone pretty much agrees that television and movies are more violent<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; sexually oriented than in the past.
