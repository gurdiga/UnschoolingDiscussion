But unschooling is unique among<br/>\nhomeschooling approaches in many ways. For one, we don&#39;t separate &quot;subjects&quot;<br/>\nfrom life. To an unschooler -- as with adults who are learning by reading<br/>\nnovels and watching TV and pursuing hobbies and learning what they need as<br/>\nthey need it for their jobs and so forth -- geography isn&#39;t a topic to be<br/>\nstudied (unless it&#39;s a hobby or an interest! :-). Geography is a tool that a<br/>\nchild may (unconsciously) pick up to explore whatever interests them or a<br/>\nparent may use to help a child understand something they&#39;re curious about.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, I don&#39;t pull out a map because it&#39;s good for my daughter to<br/>\nknow more about geography. I pull out a map to help her understand where<br/>\nwe&#39;re going or where we are or a relationship between two places. A map is a<br/>\ntool.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; *where or how geography fits into your child&#39;s day;  what resources<br/>\n&gt; do you use?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It fits into my daughter&#39;s day as it fits into an adult&#39;s day. I don&#39;t use<br/>\nresources *for* geography. But we use geography (without separating it) as a<br/>\ntool *for* real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is interested in following sports. Sports teams exist in real<br/>\ncities. They play in real weather appropriate (though sometimes unseasonal!<br/>\n;-) to the cities the Boston/New England teams are in which impacts the game<br/>\nand comes up naturally in discussion. Teams have to travel between cities<br/>\nand that impacts the schedule. Games played on the west coast at 7PM start<br/>\nat 10PM for us on the east coast.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t use sports to learn geography. Geography (without specifically<br/>\nseparating it) gets used in various ways as she explores what interests her<br/>\n(sports and Japan and creating her own worlds and cat breeds and ...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; *how you define geography (subject of much debate even among<br/>\n&gt; geographers!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Where towns and people are, the shape of the land and to some extent why<br/>\nit&#39;s shaped that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; *what other geography resources you&#39;re aware of, even if you haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; used them<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The only thing that comes to mind is surveyor&#39;s tools.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; * what kinds of geography resources you&#39;d like to see/use to help<br/>\n&gt; you do geography with your children<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to have a map -- maybe a computer program -- that I could import<br/>\npictures and type text into. It might be important in school for a map to<br/>\nshow what the major exports and imports of Peru are (so kids can forget them<br/>\nafter the test ;-), but it would be more interesting to note that this<br/>\nweek&#39;s potatoes came from Peru. And to see pictures of cousins and sports<br/>\nteam emblems in various parts of the US.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; *how you think the community of professional geographers<br/>\n&gt; could/should interact with homeschoolers/unschoolers<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>By being flexible and understanding that homeschoolers won&#39;t necessarily be<br/>\nrecreating school at home. Even nonunschoolers are often approaching<br/>\nlearning from an individual point of view rather than a mass education point<br/>\nof view. It takes different resources and approaches to help one child be<br/>\nthe best her she can be than to help a whole class learn what it&#39;s scheduled<br/>\nto learn. So geography for homeschoolers won&#39;t necessarily be approached as<br/>\na subject to be learned but as a collection of tools to help kids explore<br/>\ntheir interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":189160796,"authorName":"jodivender","from":"&quot;jodivender&quot; &lt;jvender@...&gt;","profile":"jodivender","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Geography query","postDate":"1092707142","msgId":98194,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNmcm8wNittdmRlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":98204,"prevInTime":98193,"nextInTime":98195,"topicId":98194,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, all-- I m Jodi Vender from Havertown, PA.

I&#39;m mom to 1-year-old Caroline, <br/>\nand haven&#39;t  yet decided what approach to schooling we&#39;re going <br/>\nto take.  I&#39;m also a geographer, finishing a PhD at Penn State; I <br/>\nused to work at the National Geographic Society; still do geography <br/>\neducation consulting and coordinate the PA state geography bee.  See <br/>\nhttp://www.personal.psu.edu/jav106 for more about me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve done a lot of reading about homeschooling, attended a hs <br/>\nconference earlier this summer, and am participating in a number of <br/>\ndiscussion lists to get a sense of what&#39;s going on with various <br/>\napproaches to homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m working with the Geography Education National Implementation <br/>\nProject (GENIP-  see http://genip.tamu.edu) to learn about how <br/>\nhomeschoolers are &quot;doing&quot; geography, and what resources they&#39;d like <br/>\nto see to help teach and learn geography. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m extremely interested in discussing--via this list or privately--<br/>\nthe following topics (or others I may not have thought of):<br/>\n<br/>\n*where or how geography fits into your child&#39;s day;  what resources <br/>\ndo you use?<br/>\n<br/>\n*how you define geography (subject of much debate even among <br/>\ngeographers!)<br/>\n<br/>\n*what other geography resources you&#39;re aware of, even if you haven&#39;t <br/>\nused them<br/>\n<br/>\n* what kinds of geography resources you&#39;d like to see/use to help <br/>\nyou do geography with your children  <br/>\n<br/>\n*how you think the community of professional geographers <br/>\ncould/should interact with homeschoolers/unschoolers<br/>\n<br/>\nIn return, I&#39;ll be happy to share a list of some of my favorite <br/>\ngeography resources and/or try to answer questions you might have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for sharing,<br/>\n<br/>\nJodi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98458,"nextTopicId":98494}}
