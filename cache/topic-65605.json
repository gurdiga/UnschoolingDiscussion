As the kids have gotten older and I feel they now have the skills to handle some of her less respectful ways they see her more and with this is a grandma who is going wow,  your kids have so many great qualities. It helps that she is doing an after school daycare with my brother so she really gets to see the stark difference in respect and inner motivation.

I really believe that we all have different circumstances that we must live with and that we end up being stronger people by dropping the guilt and accepting it. Not that it is easy mind you. Maybe you can focus more on what you can do within your physical and monetary constraints. Maybe you have someone who can carry some of the load once in a while and provide him with &quot;special&quot; times.<br/>\n  Realizing that it probably won&#39;t always be like this and that what you can&#39;t give him in material or other ways maybe you can make up with lots of quality one on one reading ,walking, watching movies, playing games.

I <br/>\nhave learned to block out the unimportant complaining. Then when a <br/>\nlegitimate complaint comes forth like &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; I am all ears <br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes practice, but if you could live thru the discomfort of <br/>\nbearing this child into the world, you can train yourself to have <br/>\nselective hearing.  Men have this inherantly. The last time I told my <br/>\nhusband to pick up his socks, he used this selective hearing and the <br/>\nsocks remained there. If I were to tell him someone was choking on a <br/>\nlego, then he&#39;d be there so quick! Thus the glories of selective <br/>\nhearing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t work all the time.  The husband still can&#39;t use his to <br/>\nblock out the loudness of the kids at play when he&#39;s trying to <br/>\nconcentrate on something.  I usually choose not to take that time to <br/>\ndo anything and let the kids have their fun.  But still...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whining is not playtime noise.  It is meant to get mom&#39;s <br/>\nattention.  It is like a siren.  A bell.  A signal that something is <br/>\nnot right.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBabies cry, little kids whine, older kids complain and adults vent. <br/>\nAh, the glories of communication.  We are human and we are never <br/>\nfully satisfied with things.  That&#39;s why we are capable of adaptation <br/>\nand changing. <br/>\n<br/>\nLittle kids don&#39;t have the aptitude yet to understand the world <br/>\naround them fully; what they can change and what they cannot and how <br/>\nto adapt to any of it. So they whine.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoms are a bit different.  We can understand the difference between <br/>\nthese things and we are pros at adaptation.  We also understand when <br/>\na child is just whiney or when it is a serious need requiring our <br/>\nattentiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou CAN selectively tune out the whining. You can also note to your <br/>\nchild that you are going to ignore until the complaining stops and <br/>\nexplain that you cannot change what cannot be changed (kids believe <br/>\nmoms are superhuman sometimes).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also look into diet, general stresses, television <br/>\nprogramming, sleep disturbances, and playtime situations to see if <br/>\nthere isn&#39;t an underlying stress that is causing your child to be <br/>\noverly sensitive. This goes back to the part where mommies can change <br/>\nsome things. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.  And remember that raising a child is like growing a <br/>\nflower garden.

Maybe it takes away their power. I have an 11 year old son who has just been diagnosed with low thyroid. He has been real negative since about two. I have found that it is best to just let him have his feelings. I really don&#39;t have to fix anything unless he specifically asks for help and then I will work with him to find a solution. He still complains a lot and we have wondered about depression as it is big in extended family. At this time we are trying to find a good homeopathic remedy and working on helping him to turn some of his language more positive. Gently and kindly pointing it out has been helpful but I have had to be careful to be nonshaming and nonjudgemental so I usually wait until I am not so frustrated. Another thing to consider is to maybe see why it pushes buttons or disturbs you so much. For me it was because I judged myself as being a less than adequate parent. Since I have rethought that I am able to let him own it and I am able to objectively explore the situation and see if he needs some more emotional support somewhere in his life. And this is not always needed from me.<br/>\n  Maureen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Thanks, Annette<br/>\n<br/>\n  We joined for two reasons. One for the support provided for true unschooling. It is an almost unheard of concept and two for the money. They get money from the government and they give it back to us.The program toally allows us to unschool.No extra pressures, meetings with teachers etc..We have only just joined three weeeks ago as we were on the waiting list. I signed up with the interest in having some credibility to my unschooling. A program like this would relax other peoples worries some (family). However this was before I jpoined on this list. Since then I have truly become more sure of my life and not needing justification for it. The support has been trmendous. Child led learning is truly encouraged and understood. My first experience with that at a beurocratic level. Our support person calls and chats with Brianna with tremendous respect and regard.There are numerous spots on the site to talk with others and participate in other activities.Brianna has not been interested and that so far has been okay.<br/>\n  Maureen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
