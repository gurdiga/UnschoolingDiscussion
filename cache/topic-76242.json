I <br/>\nam a single parent, worked fulltime days at a job i couldnt really <br/>\nbring him along too, and his father refused to change shifts to keep <br/>\nhim. My son at this point was refusing to go to school, and i would <br/>\nhave to take him into work with me after a half hour of tears trying <br/>\nto get him to go into the school (his father would just bodily drag <br/>\nhim up the steps and dump him off in class)...what i did was post a <br/>\nplea for temporary care on my local hs email list. I got several <br/>\nresponses offering to help. I found a really great mom with a boy my <br/>\nson&#39;s age who was more than happy to have a playmate for her son. I <br/>\ndid pay her, although she said she didnt need me to. This allowed for <br/>\nenough time for me to figure out a plan of action (in my case, <br/>\nquitting my job and moving back in with family.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend your local HS email list or support group and <br/>\nasking for help. Its not an ideal situation but will give you more <br/>\ntime until you can figure things out. Maybe find a job in which your <br/>\ndaughter can go with you, or maybe providing childcare in your home. <br/>\nIt was very frustrating at first for me because i couldnt find any <br/>\nhelp, but joining the email group for my area was the key.
