Mark and I have a wonderful daughter , Caroline, who is <br/>\n16. We are all de-schooling having finally taken Caroline out of PS in <br/>\nFebruary. Yes, I know... but we DID&#39;NT know until now. The best thing that <br/>\nwe ever did was remove her from that poisonous environment. We only wish we <br/>\nhad done it before and also with her older sister ( now 21).<br/>\nI have been following the ADD thread with great interest and could not keep <br/>\nout of it. Caroline is dyslexic, add, dyscalculic(?), etcetcetc. Also has a <br/>\nvery high IQ. You&#39;d never know to meet her that she had any difficulties <br/>\nwith traditional schoolwork. Except for a few years of elementary school <br/>\nwhen she was with wonderful caring teachers working on the dyslexia, school <br/>\nhas been a form of torture for all of us - parents, sister, grandparents , <br/>\nyou name it.  The district , becasue of the obvious difference in <br/>\nintelligence and testing abilites, suggested special ed classes - which as I <br/>\nsaid  were great in lower grades. Middle school and high school she was not <br/>\ntaught much if anything . Mostly learned stuff at home ;-)We should have <br/>\ncaught on, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to the point: these learning differences are very real. They do not have <br/>\nto become excuses or labels to exist. The strengths and weaknesses occur in <br/>\nany setting. Caroline simply cannot add, subtract, multiple or divide <br/>\nwithout the use of a calculator and then she may or may not write the answer <br/>\ndown correctly: ex. 46 rather than 64. She is,on the other hand, perfectly <br/>\ncapable of doing geometry and algrbra if allowed the use of the calculator. <br/>\nShe reads any thing she lays hold of, pretty easily and with great <br/>\ncomprehension. However, she doesn&#39;t spell well and when she writes ( rather <br/>\nthan types) her writing is nearly incomprehensible. Allowances do have to be <br/>\nmade. She handles the stickier situations gracefully now, but when she was <br/>\nyounger she would become very frustrated and behave quite badly. This was <br/>\ntrue whether she was playing on the weekends or in a classroom setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we hadn&#39;t had this information, she would have thought she was stupid, <br/>\ninstead of just learning in a different way. We would not have know how to <br/>\nhelp her and may have done her serious harm emotionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do see a big change in her behavior and happiness since February. She is <br/>\nlooking forward to real life - college and beyond. She tells everyone that <br/>\nshe homeschools and is on the &quot; accelerated program&quot; so she can go on to <br/>\ncollege in the fall of next year. So far she hasn&#39;t looked a textbook, but <br/>\nhas read up a storm on her own- worked a zillion hours on the computer on a <br/>\nwebsite a friend has- watched a bunch of neat movies.  Personally, I think <br/>\nshe can go on tomorrow. But then there&#39;s the pesky SAT.  That&#39;s a whole <br/>\nnother thread ;-)<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37953,"nextTopicId":37944}}
