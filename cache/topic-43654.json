Just <br/>\nprepare something quickly -- if he&#39;s already started to sink, maybe do it a <br/>\nbit more attractively than usual (instead of handing him an apple and a chunk <br/>\nof cheese, slice up an apple and sprinkle it with a bit of cinnamon-sugar and <br/>\ndecorate with curls of string cheese, for example). Put it out near where he <br/>\nis - so he can&#39;t miss it - but don&#39;t make a point of it. (Trust him to learn, <br/>\nover time, how much better he feels and functions if he eats.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso- sometimes something substantial is what they really NEED at that point, <br/>\nbut they&#39;ve let it go too far and something substantial seems too heavy to <br/>\nthem. So - some frozen grapes or sliced apples or a little box of raisins or <br/>\nsomething like that - quick fruit sugar - can get them feeling just enough <br/>\nbetter to be willing to go ahead and eat a sandwich or something else with <br/>\nsome protein.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\nThe National Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43575,"nextTopicId":43660}}
