I don&#39;t do any work with her on it other than reading to her or answering questions. This makes it slower than what public school kids might do but think of it (and explain it to DH) this way. In school it&#39;s as if they&#39;re building a foundation for a building. They hand out shovels to the kids (maybe miss a couple). Tell them to quickly dig. It&#39;s a haphazard hole when it&#39;s done but nevertheless they are ordering to build the foundation really fast. When it&#39;s done, most of kids have an ok idea of what a foudation should be but for some it&#39;s not strong enough to build further on. And nevermind the few kids still stuck down in the hole. At home your daughter is building her own understanding of words and reading. If left alone she&#39;ll experiment with sounds, likely write out a lot of gibberish, use logic to deduce what signs say. She&#39;s building her foundation one step at a time and she not only understands every step but thouroughly enjoys it. It took me a long time to catch on to this but I can see my daughter work through it all the time on her own. She may be a late reader when it comes but her understanding and love of words, reading and languagewill likely be more complete than most PSers. You&#39;re unschooling and this is why...To give her the joy of learning that most kids are denied.
