I am<br/>\nvery concerned about the influences n my children&#39;s life, and it is very<br/>\ndifficult to find children (even homeschooled) that I think are worth their<br/>\ntime.  We don&#39;t do alot of play dates ect because of this reason.  My<br/>\nchildren love to play with one another, and they love being around me, their<br/>\nfather, and their Grandmother (who lives up the driveway)<br/>\nThey are happy children, healthy...and very busy.  They also don&#39;t have any<br/>\nof those negative type behaviors.  We have just had company twice, and they<br/>\nboth had children.  There was a MAJOR difference in their behavior and my<br/>\nchildren&#39;s behavior.<br/>\nLet me give you one example from many....<br/>\nAll the kids were swimming...my son (age 8) said to our visitor girl (also 8)<br/>\nthat there was a wolf spider on her head.  (no adult heard this to this<br/>\npoint)  She came yelling to her Mother that my son had said there was a<br/>\nspider on her...  Her Mother laughed and said, &quot;Well, I think he just has<br/>\nyour number (meaning her was teasing her)  Well, I was quite surprised..and<br/>\nso was my son...he was truthfully telling her there was a spider on her, and<br/>\nwas going to get it off of her.  I was so surprised to realize that this type<br/>\nof teasing is so commonplace, that the Mother immediately thinks like this<br/>\ntoo.  It really struck me....my kids do not tease each other like this..it is<br/>\njust not done in our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children also relate well to adults.  This is something that schooled<br/>\nchildren are not very strong on...  But, I know some homeschooled children<br/>\nwho are also like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nSocialization is not just playing with others of ones age.  Socialization is<br/>\nbeing around all people...of all types, all ages, all everything.
