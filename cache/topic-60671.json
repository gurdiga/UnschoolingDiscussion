This little person <br/>\nis forced to eat all her lunch, she told my son. He brings it up every day, <br/>\nobviously really bothers him. Her new parents use a lot of control and power <br/>\nin raising her, and it seems as though the compulsory eating has to do with <br/>\nthe &quot;do as you are told&quot; mentality. <br/>\nThe little girl has food issues here, and so I have filled a basket with <br/>\nhealthy snacks, and some not so healthy ones, and put it in the fridge. She <br/>\nis welcome to help herself at anytime, and after 3 months she still runs to <br/>\nthe fridge first thing and checks the basket and Still asks repeatedly if <br/>\nit&#39;s ok if she eats the things in it.<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"force feeding was: Johnny can learn","postDate":"1047333751","msgId":60671,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMTlPU1FlU096TkNXYnp3V0owMDAzMDhiZUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":60699,"prevInTime":60670,"nextInTime":60672,"topicId":60671,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We never even had to discuss it again. But <br/>\nnow, if I even get a hint of the taste of liver, I gag. I am blessed with a <br/>\n7yr old who has a huge gag reflex. If he even thinks he might not like <br/>\nsomething, up it comes. Needless to say, I do not try to force stuff on him. <br/>\nNot that I would anyways.<br/>\nPerhaps we were totured by our parents in order to save our children the <br/>\nsame fate?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I never was made to eat anything I didn&#39;t want to. I certainly never <br/>\nmade any of my kids do that either. Even with Tara &lt;bg&gt; although I worried <br/>\nwhen she was little as to what she ate and wouldn&#39;t eat. Some people here <br/>\nsay the reason they wouldn&#39;t make their child eat something they didn&#39;t want <br/>\nis because they were forced and know how awful it is. I&#39;m wondering about <br/>\nthe people who do force their kids? What could possibly be the reason <br/>\nsomeone would force someone else to eat something they didn&#39;t like? Just <br/>\nseems so clear to me not to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60429,"nextTopicId":60283}}
