My sister and brother-in-law, when they were first <br/>\ntogether in the 1970&#39;s, were living in a one room wood-heated building, and <br/>\nevery night they read to each other from Lord of the Rings.  I went over <br/>\nthere extra times during that time, and would take a turn reading.  Those not <br/>\nreading would cook, fold clothes, tend the fire, whatever they could do <br/>\nquietly, and then readers would switch off.  It was a really great experience <br/>\n(even though I was just a visitor).<br/>\n<br/>\nI calligraphed Bilbo&#39;s Bath Song for them then and it&#39;s framed and in one of <br/>\nthe bathrooms in the big stone house they&#39;re building.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether kids would appreciate it, I can&#39;t say.  We had all read the books <br/>\nbefore, so this was for review and for the joy of the experience.  For them <br/>\nit was bonding.  A trip to another world together (even though sometimes I <br/>\nshowed up like Samwise to tag along a ways).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28071,"nextTopicId":28036}}
