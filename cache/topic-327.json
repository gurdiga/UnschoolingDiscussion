Think Bison, Moose and Elk calving, wildflowers, bear cubs,<br/>\ngeysers, some snow...<br/>\nThat is, if you can stand the dust from our remodel.  Anyone have teens or<br/>\npre-teens they want to bring to do interior sheetrock, electrical,<br/>\nplumbing, painting and decorating or exterior landscaping?  How about child<br/>\ncare?
