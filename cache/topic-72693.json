Drew a picture of <br/>\n3/4 times 6 and came up with 4 1/2 c. of boiling water, but what <br/>\nabout the cold water and ice cubes? I was sitting there, writing out <br/>\nthis math problem on paper, when Robby said &quot;Seven and a half&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Just a sec, Rob. We...gotta...figure it...&quot; He was right. He didn&#39;t <br/>\nneed paper. He just did the thing in his head.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll never set him down in front of a sheet of math problems EVER <br/>\nagain. Unless he wants to. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he and Katie gobbled down the edible Jello and slimy Swedish Fish <br/>\nin one sitting.<br/>\n<br/>\newwwww. <br/>\nHeidiC</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72654,"nextTopicId":72694}}
