I am a woman from Holland and <br/>\nwith my family, I am in the process of immigrating to Canada. We have <br/>\nthree children, age 2, 7 and 9. In Holland we are not allowed to <br/>\nhomeschool or unschool (can you believe that in a democratic, free <br/>\ncountry...sigh...), to my big frustration! Of course my youngest one <br/>\nis not going to school yet, but the other two are, and I find the <br/>\neffects disastrous. My 7 year old son is very clever, he reads and <br/>\ndoes things that are way above his level, but since he goes to school <br/>\nhe has lost most of his interest in learning - he hates it. He says <br/>\nat school they have to do exercise after exercise of things he <br/>\nalready knows and it is BORING. Of course it is. He wants to know <br/>\nabout Robin Hood and learn how to do archery and that kind of stuff. <br/>\nMy hands itch to dive into it with him, but when he comes home from <br/>\nschool he is simply to tired to do anything but hang around. <br/>\nMy oldest daughter (9) is a very creative girl, very expressive, but <br/>\nin school they pay attention almost only to the cognitive side of <br/>\nthings, which is not her strong side. What I see now, is that she is  <br/>\ncompletely forgetting who she really is. Doesn&#39;t paint, draw, sing <br/>\nanymore. IS very fake and tells me frankly she is not happy and <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t even know why.<br/>\nSo, you can guess, one of the first things I want to do when we are <br/>\nin Canada is unschool my children. Now I have heard that the first <br/>\ntime of unschooling, after they have gone to school already, is very <br/>\ntough, because they don&#39;t know how to inspire themselves anymore, and <br/>\nthey don&#39;t know what their interest really is. I am not looking <br/>\nforward to that period, but I definitely will deal with it, because I <br/>\nwant the true spirit of my children back. Does any of you have any <br/>\nexperience with this?<br/>\nI have another question as well.

My youngest <br/>\ndaughter of two of course copies everything, and also her behaviour. <br/>\nWhen my oldest is in school she plays totally different, is singing <br/>\nand in fantasygames - has a break, so to say, from her sister. One of <br/>\nthe things that i think will be difficult for me in homeschooling is <br/>\nher continuous presence, and the young one copying everything, <br/>\nincluding all the things that are fake and unreal. I understand that <br/>\nit is very possible that my oldest&#39;s behaviour will change over time <br/>\nwhen she is not going to school anymore, but before that she is <br/>\ndefinitely having some negative effect on her brother and sister. Do <br/>\nany of you recognize this and if yes, how do you deal with it?<br/>\nI hope you can give me an answer on this, I&#39;d love to hear your <br/>\nexperience!<br/>\nTHank you very much,<br/>\nkind regards,<br/>\nCaroline van Daal</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57886,"nextTopicId":57872}}
