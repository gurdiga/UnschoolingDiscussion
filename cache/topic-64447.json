My boys are 6 and 3. We have slowly been adopting more of an unschooling lifestyle<br/>\n(never did &quot;school&quot; so that has been the easiest, letting go of other restrictions (tv and<br/>\nfood) have been more of a challenge for me but getting easier every day). What I have found<br/>\nis that unschooling has not led directly to perfectly behaved kids but it has led to me being<br/>\na much more creative mom. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been an ongoing process...at first I would run into situations for which I could not find<br/>\nan &quot;unschooling&quot; (i.e., solution that was respectful to my boys that did not include<br/>\npunishments etc) solution. But then I would think about it more (I started thinking WWJD...<br/>\nwhat would Joyce do ;o) ) and lo and behold I would come up with several other options.<br/>\nAfter the fact of course, but the more I did this, the easier it was to come up with<br/>\nsolutions when I needed them. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany times it would have been very easy to say, well, I tried, but it did not work. But I <br/>\nam glad that I kept thinking and looking. I have found that my attitude has shifted lately.<br/>\nWhat I used to see as problems I now see as things that I need to find a different approach.<br/>\nAnd I feel confident that I will find one. For example, a friend watched the boys for me <br/>\nyesterday morning. She made them cinnamon toast with pepperidge farm cinnamon bread. Jason <br/>\nhad never had it and loved it. Had several pieces while I was gone and asked for more<br/>\nwhen I got back. He very well could have eaten the whole loaf and if we were home I would<br/>\nhave let him. I did tell him at one point that we needed to save some bread for them<br/>\nand that it was not polite to eat all of someone else&#39;s food. I also told him that we could<br/>\npick up some on the way home. He was not really happy and whined a little. I could easily<br/>\nsay that letting him eat what he wants is a complete failure and it led to him being <br/>\na greedy ungracious guest in someone&#39;s home. But that really is not the case. All that means<br/>\nis that we need to talk a bit more (at home when we are not in the middle of it) about<br/>\nhow we would not like it if someone came and ate all of our food and to keep that in mind.<br/>\nBut I trust that he will get it with time and practice. Maybe that is the biggest change<br/>\nI have found since adopting unschooling parenting practices (not sure what else to call them)<br/>\nI really do trust that my kids will want to do what is right. They are good kids and I do<br/>\nnot see it as my job to *make* them behave...it is my job to help guide them and trust that<br/>\nthey will learn what they need to learn...including not only academics but life lessons<br/>\nas well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really do hope that you do not scrap everything based on this one incident. You said yourself<br/>\nthat making him do lessons was not working. Keep reading here and keep looking for better<br/>\nways to handle situations. Post about a specific incident and see if others can come up<br/>\nwith some ideas. I know that I have been amazed at what solutions I have been able to<br/>\nwork out with the boys just by being open and looking for solutions other then putting<br/>\nmy foot down or telling them what to do. There have been times when I have just told them<br/>\nthat I had no idea what to do but that what we were doing was not working! That in itself<br/>\nhas given us a breather and some space to work it out. It can be very difficult<br/>\nat times, but I have found that it is getting easier. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it is worth it. It has not created kids who always go along with what I want or kids<br/>\nwho don&#39;t complain or who always do what I tell them to do. But I am starting to see that <br/>\nthey see that I am on their side. They still want what they want and I am still not <br/>\n*always* able to give it to them. But I think they are also seeing that I will try my <br/>\nbest to help them get what they want. That I do not want to stand in their way. And that <br/>\nhas helped our relationship immensely (and I thought that we had a pretty good one to <br/>\nstart with!).<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma2kids","from":"&quot;zenmomma2kids&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: unschooling problems","postDate":"1050449592","msgId":65007,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI3aTRybysybjRqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDMwNDE1MDUxMjIzLjU4NDg0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwOTA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64973,"nextInTopic":65028,"prevInTime":65006,"nextInTime":65008,"topicId":64447,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... also.

Unschooling doesn&#39;t &quot;make &quot; kids more manageable. It&#39;s not about that at all. School is more about that. That&#39;s one of the reasons it&#39;s not about learning - it&#39;s about creating controlled consumers.<br/>\n  I&#39;ve raised two kids (they&#39;re 28 & 30) traditionally.

One step at a time. Your children are going to cry, laugh, whine, hunger, thirst, be impatient, be loving, be wonderful, be kids. Unschooling doesn&#39;t &quot;make &quot; kids more manageable. It&#39;s not about that at all. School is more about that. That&#39;s one of the reasons it&#39;s not about learning - it&#39;s about creating controlled consumers.<br/>\nI&#39;ve raised two kids (they&#39;re 28 & 30) traditionally. I&#39;ve a ten y.o. now and we&#39;re iunschooling. Whew -the difference is amazing! I can&#39;t begin to tell you how close we are, how much fun we have!1 <br/>\nI&#39;ll tell you something else - Brianna is well read, articulate and well, most people do not believe she&#39;s only 10!!
