He doesn&#39;t like his boss breathing down his neck, he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike someone else telling him how to do his work, etc., etc. Sounds like a <br/>\nnatural for unschooling, huh? He&#39;s not really too bad. He agrees <br/>\nwholeheartedly that history texts are for the birds, that reading instruction <br/>\nis unnecessary for our son (fortunately he&#39;s already reading so that wasn&#39;t a <br/>\nhurdle we had to cross), and so on.
