I have been quiet lately and I apologize for that but we have<br/>\nbeen going through alot lately.  My 8 yr olds father is fighting for<br/>\ncustody due to the fact that I am going to homeschool.  I had an idea and<br/>\nmy attorney thought it would be helpful also.  Here it is:  I was<br/>\nwondering if those of you that have children between the ages of 6 and 10<br/>\nwould be willing to have them write a short letter telling about their<br/>\nexperience with homeschooling.  Things like how the like the one on one<br/>\nattention, how they like the education, how they feel socially and just<br/>\nany feelings they would be good to share.  I would also then like the<br/>\nparents of these children to write a short letter giving their input<br/>\nalso.  If there are children of other ages that would like to write that<br/>\nwould be great also.  I am just wanting to take something to my daughters<br/>\ndad and possibly to court (if it goes into court I will be sure not show<br/>\nnames of anyone from the letters).  <br/>\nThe HSLDA does not help with these kinds of cases so I am kind of out on<br/>\nmy own.  I am petrified of the financial impact this may have on my<br/>\nfamily but giving up is not an option.  My daugter needs and wants to be<br/>\nhomeschooled.<br/>\nIf anyone is interested in doing this please email me privately and I<br/>\nwill give you my address.  Thank you in advance ......you guys are always<br/>\nhere when I need you and even if you do not want to do a letter for<br/>\nme...thank you for just being here :)<br/>\nKari~~mommy to Amanda 15, Ashley 7 and Brandon 3.<br/>\nWife to Wally.<br/>\nAIM contry219<br/>\nICQ 31745923<br/>\nYahoo contry219</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1675,"nextTopicId":1681}}
