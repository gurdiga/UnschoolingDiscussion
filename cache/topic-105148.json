They were inconvenient<br/>\nlittle things that parents had to protected and shelter until they were<br/>\nbig enough to leave home.  They couldn&#39;t really do much, didn&#39;t know<br/>\nmuch, had to be supervised, etc.  Holt believed that this view of<br/>\nchildren wasn&#39;t always the view of children.  Other era&#39;s saw children as<br/>\ncapable and, though it wasn&#39;t necessarily good for kids and rarely of the<br/>\nchild&#39;s choosing, kids were taken seriously, given serious jobs and had<br/>\nbig responsibilities at a young age.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHe compared the attitudes that children needed to be taken care of with<br/>\nthe earlier attitudes that women needed to be taken care of and he did so<br/>\nfor shock value.  He thought in the new age of awareness about women&#39;s<br/>\nissues he could jolt people into thinking about children&#39;s issues in the<br/>\nsame way.   I also think he sort of wanted to seem cool and hip to those<br/>\nliberated women he was exchanging letters with. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t know diddles about medieval history or family units of Europe<br/>\nhundreds of years ago.  I just think his hope was to startle people into<br/>\nnew thinking about the way parents and schools were treating kids in the<br/>\nsixties and seventies when he was spending lots of time looking at kids<br/>\nand schools.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think, if Holt had had a little more time on the planet, he would have<br/>\nsomething new to say about &quot;Escape from Childhood.&quot;  He had that kind of<br/>\nmind made him work a thing over and over and I think he would have<br/>\nchanged some of his ideas over time and probably did.  I wish we could<br/>\nhave asked him.&lt;g&gt;      <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a letter Holt wrote to his editor at Dutton when he first started<br/>\nworking on Escape from Childhood.  It doesn&#39;t go into the details of the<br/>\nbook but gives a little glimpse of the writer.  In the letter he&#39;s not<br/>\nsure what the title of his new book will be but he&#39;s considering Out of<br/>\nthe Prison of Childhood and Escape from the Prison of Childhood.   The<br/>\nletter appears in  &quot;A Life Worth Living, Selected Letters of John Holt&quot; <br/>\nand I can send you a copy of the letter, Sandra, if you don&#39;t have that<br/>\nbook.

Having ever since then been more interested in medieval history <br/>\nthan any of the other of it, and then getting this through-the-knothole view of <br/>\nthe 70&#39;s through this John Holt book I&#39;d never read, I&#39;m embarrassed for what <br/>\npassed for &quot;research&quot; in those days (as people in the future will probably be <br/>\nembarrassed on bahalf of ours).  He says over and OVER and over and over (I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to count, but it passed six) that the modern family was &quot;invented,&quot; but <br/>\nrather than blaming the post-WWII return to the homes and all the new suburbs <br/>\nwhich would seem justifiable to me, he was citing women&#39;s &quot;historians&quot; <br/>\ntalking about when, whether and why there could&#39;ve been family units over the past <br/>\nfew hundred years in Europe, mostly.   In the 70&#39;s, they&#39;d&#39;ve been reading <br/>\nstuff collected earlier.  And it wasn&#39;t until the 1980&#39;s that social history <br/>\nreally got its stride and GOOD evidence started being collected in sufficient <br/>\nquantities that comparisons could be made.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other stories in the book I&#39;m really glad he found, but that lame <br/>\ninvention of the family&quot; was starting to make me twitch, partly because I <br/>\nremember those days and how the women&#39;s movement would grasp at ANYthing that <br/>\njustified going to work (which many women had been having to do all along anyway, <br/>\nand the equal pay for equal work business was crucially important), and that <br/>\njustified their not having children at all, or having children they didn&#39;t get <br/>\ntoo attached to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember their spin on the &quot;infants need to bond&quot; research.  Yes, they <br/>\nsaid, but it doesn&#39;t have to be with their mother, it can be with any adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think back on that now with deepest sorrow for a badillion children who <br/>\nmight&#39;ve bonded with the first few babysitters or daycare workers or elderly <br/>\nrelatives, and then the next one, and the next one, and then gave up from the <br/>\ngrief of instability of relationships.
