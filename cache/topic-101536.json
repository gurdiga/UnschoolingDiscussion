They might be resentful or afraid or sad, but <br/>\nthe behavior was to the point that they got adult help, and the adult help <br/>\nshould appear pretty quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I think it does matter how the child is feeling, especially young <br/>\nchildren. Helping them identify their feelings, sort them out, put names <br/>\nto them, especially in reactionary situations, is really valuable for <br/>\nlots of reasons: communication, self-awareness, conflict resolution. All <br/>\nof this can be said while walking to the next room, holding hands or <br/>\ncarrying the child if s/he&#39;s really upset. Talking about what&#39;s going on <br/>\nalso helps to keep things in a rational perspective for both of us, <br/>\nhelping me stay calm as well, and get some more details. I can&#39;t think <br/>\nof too many scenarios where I&#39;ve had to be at a full run--in fact, I <br/>\ncan&#39;t think of any.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s good on interpersonal stuff, but on physical stuff or where a third <br/>\nchild is involved, I just go there.  If Holly were to come and tell me that <br/>\nKirby and Marty were about to come to blows, for example, I wouldn&#39;t ask Holly <br/>\nwhether she needed my help or how she felt.   If she came and said &quot;Marty hurt my <br/>\nfeelings,&quot; I&#39;d talk to her as long as she wanted, and later talk to Marty.  <br/>\nAnd then probably go back and talk to Holly again eventually, all involving <br/>\nhelping them come to an understanding of why the other person is the way he/she <br/>\nis, and what different responses and attitudes might help next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess in my head I&#39;m thinkig of reporting physical actions and immediate <br/>\ndangers, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s my kids&#39; jobs to negotiate physical situations <br/>\nwith the other kids.  If Marty&#39;s up on the roof for no good reason I know of, <br/>\nthat&#39;s neither Kirby&#39;s responsibility nor Holly&#39;s.  I still remember my mom <br/>\nputting me in charge of my little sister when my mom was even right in the house. <br/>\n It&#39;s not good and it&#39;s not fair, and my sister was hurt BADLY once when my <br/>\nmom wasn&#39;t out there and I was.  It wasn&#39;t my fault, my mom said, but I knew my <br/>\nmom wouldn&#39;t have let it happen had she been standing there.  So it was my <br/>\nmom&#39;s fault but happened &quot;on my watch,&quot; and that wasn&#39;t cool for her to do to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n======<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich, is why I pointed out that I *differentiate* between the more <br/>\ninterpersonal versus immediate needs. I have three young children (7, <br/>\nalmost 6 and 4), so much of the stuff I&#39;m dealing with on a regular <br/>\nbasis is more about interpersonal and less about someone climbing on a <br/>\nroof. I don&#39;t put my kids in charge of each other--ever. What I&#39;m <br/>\ntalking about is along the lines of &quot;Julia has the Polly Pockets with <br/>\nthe ponytails and I really want her&quot; or &quot;Em and Julia are in their room <br/>\nand don&#39;t want me in there&quot; or &quot;Sam&#39;s taking my legos.&quot; Helping kids <br/>\nlearn the skills for negotiating the countless interpersonal scenarios <br/>\nthat come up each day is what I&#39;m talking about, not children out on <br/>\nroofs or drowning in tubs of water. With my kids being so close in age, <br/>\nthere is no way I would put anyone &quot;in charge,&quot; but there&#39;s lots of <br/>\ninterpersonal negotiation going on *all* day long.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, perhaps, too, there&#39;s a significant difference between the ages <br/>\nof the children we&#39;re talking about. When my 4 yo or 6 yo come to me, <br/>\nit&#39;s different than an 8 or a 10 or a 12 yo who already has a pretty <br/>\ngood grasp of how she&#39;s feeling. Asking the question &quot;And you need my <br/>\nhelp?&quot; is more about reflective listening and validating the child&#39;s <br/>\nfeelings than about a cynical, eye-brow-raised, &quot;And you really need my <br/>\nhelp?&quot;  With younger children, at least in my home, there&#39;s a lot more <br/>\nimmediate parental presence anyway that makes it possible to intervene <br/>\nbefore things come to blows or dire circumstances.

So it was my <br/>\nmom&#39;s fault but happened &quot;on my watch,&quot; and that wasn&#39;t cool for her to do to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had been playing with a big tub of water outside, and my sister was two, <br/>\nso I was  five.   She stood on the seat of a little stroller, backwards and was <br/>\nholding on to the handle, fell forward with her mouth open and cut the inside <br/>\nroof of her mouth on a rock.  She got up on her own and ran to the door of <br/>\nthe house which was only about six feet away, and there was blood running to her <br/>\nfeet by the time my mom came to the door, just seconds later (because she was <br/>\nscreaming horribly).   She was in the hospital a couple of days with stitches <br/>\nin the roof of her mouth and everybody freaking out, while I was left to stay <br/>\nwith a childless aunt and uncle who had not one toy or book.  A porch swing <br/>\non an upstairs balcony (one of those quad apartments where the entry way has an <br/>\napartment on either side, stairs up the middle and two apartments upstairs, <br/>\nthat are or used to be common in Fort Worth where we were, and other such <br/>\nplaces).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what would my mom have expected me to do?   I was too little to <br/>\nphysically take my sister down, even if I had known enough to see the danger of the <br/>\nlikelihood of that stroller falling over.  Had I walked away to the house I would <br/>\nprobably be in trouble for leaving my sister too close to water.    <br/>\n<br/>\nPartly because of situations like that, I never wanted to leave my children <br/>\nfeeling responsible for siblings, ever.  They&#39;re not the parents.  They don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to learn to handle those situations.

So that is how I thought of <br/>\nit, from the beginning. And - lots of times what somebody else calls <br/>\n&quot;tattling&quot; is really very clearly &quot;reporting,&quot; such as &quot;Marc is <br/>\nthrowing sand in the babies&#39; eyes.&quot; This is information that the kid <br/>\nthinks the adult should have.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve always tried to focus on the person &quot;reporting&quot; and the way <br/>\nthey&#39;re feeling. So, instead of so-and-so&#39;s-doing-x, I&#39;ll try to <br/>\nredirect the conversation from the person doing x to the reporter: &quot;And <br/>\nthat makes you feel sad/ scared/ angry/ whatever?&quot; I&#39;m not sure where I <br/>\ngot this idea from, but it always seemed important to me to tell about <br/>\noneself rather than someone else and to work at identifying the feeling <br/>\ninside. I think this is how I always differentiated the reporting from <br/>\nthe tattling in my mind. So, a scenario in our home might be Emily or <br/>\nJulia coming to tell me that Sam is swinging a rope around downstairs. I <br/>\nwould reflect back to them something like, &quot;When Sam swings the rope <br/>\nlike that you&#39;re afraid you might get hurt or something might get <br/>\nbroken? Do you need some help in handling it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat second question, &quot;Do you need some help in handling it?&quot; is an <br/>\nimportant part for us, too. Sometimes we will talk about how they can <br/>\nhandle a problem by themselves, and run different scenarios or things to <br/>\nsay, sometimes they want me to come help. I do differentiate somewhat <br/>\nbetween the more interpersonal situations that they might handle by <br/>\nthemselves and more immediate situations, drawing upon groundwork that <br/>\nwe&#39;ve already done. I&#39;ll ask if they&#39;ve tried to negotiate and what <br/>\nthey&#39;ve tried and offer suggestions before I jump in as arbiter. Truth <br/>\nis, however, I&#39;m often in the same room with them, so things don&#39;t <br/>\nusually escalate too far without my intervention. Handling it alone most <br/>\noften happens with Emily (7) and Julia (almost 6) who share a room, so <br/>\noften play by themselves and are emotionally adept at problem solving in <br/>\nways that my youngest guy isn&#39;t yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a parent who is quick to help negotiate and model important <br/>\ncommunication skills when the children are young lays the groundwork for <br/>\nthe kids to be able to handle situations themselves in the future. By <br/>\nbeing available and willing to help negotiate, identify the problem and <br/>\nname the feelings, we give our kids the tools to handle conflict in an <br/>\nemotionally intelligent way. Telling them to handle conflict without <br/>\noffering the tools that will help is very much like throwing them in the <br/>\nwater and telling them to swim as we walk away.<br/>\n<br/>\n --Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\nPS--Thanks Kelli for the kudos on my article.

That&#39;s still <br/>\n&quot;reporting&quot; and not &quot;tattling.&quot; The correct response is to thank the <br/>\nchild for reporting and either do something about it - stop Marc from <br/>\nthrowing sand at the babies - or reassure the reporter that things are <br/>\nfine - &quot;Thank you so much for telling me that you&#39;re worried about <br/>\nAnika and I&#39;ll keep a close eye on her.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - what would actual &quot;tattling&quot; look like? The idea was that if the <br/>\nkid is &quot;just&quot; trying to get another kid into trouble, that would be <br/>\ntattling. And, in fact, that happens and my response as a parent IS <br/>\ndifferent than to &quot;real&quot; reporting. But my response is not to ignore it <br/>\nor punish it or otherwise just try to make it stop. My response was to <br/>\nrespond to what seemed to me to be the real problem or to talk to the <br/>\n&quot;tattler&quot; about what was going on and see if I could help or to just go <br/>\nbe more present and see if things cooled down a little. For example, if <br/>\nRosie came in the house angrily saying, &quot;Roxana is stomping on the <br/>\nflowers in the garden,&quot; I&#39;d go see what was happening - if it turned <br/>\nout Rox had accidentally stepped on a flower - and Rosie knew it was <br/>\nnot going to happen again, it was just an accident, nobody or no thing <br/>\nwas in any danger, and her report was for no reason OTHER than to get <br/>\nRoxana into trouble - then that could be called &quot;tattling.&quot; So - I <br/>\nSTILL wouldn&#39;t chew out Rosie for bothering me with tattling - because <br/>\nreally it would indicate there was some other problem going on between <br/>\nthem that she was frustrated with and couldn&#39;t figure out how to <br/>\nresolve on her own and that was what would have brought her to me. I <br/>\nmight just stay out there to be nearby and able to see and hear what <br/>\nhappens when they start to play together again. I might ask, straight <br/>\nout, &quot;How are things going out here - you having problems of some <br/>\nkind?&quot; If the so-called &quot;tattler&quot; is upset - I might take her aside and <br/>\nsay, &quot;So, what&#39;s going on - you seem upset?&quot; Etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m trying to say is that reporting and tattling ARE different - <br/>\none comes from true concern about a situation and the other comes from <br/>\nfrustration or anger at another person - but either one represents a <br/>\nchild coming to an adult for help and both should be encouraged, not <br/>\ndiscouraged.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: #2, Tattling (was Bad advice from the mainstream)","postDate":"1102870212","msgId":101536,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkZS4zMDU1ODhjMi4yZWVkZDBjNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":101542,"prevInTime":101535,"nextInTime":101537,"topicId":101536,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-316549953\">&lt;&lt; 2. Don&#39;t respond to tattling.<br/>\nOnce they figure out that you aren&#39;t listening, they&#39;ll stop doing it so <br/>\nmuch. Or when they&#39;re mid-bicker, ignore them and do something odd -- like <br/>\ncrawl <br/>\nunder the dining room table with a book. That&#39;ll stop the argument in its <br/>\ntracks, and they might even come join you. (Works for tantrums too!)  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIgnore them and they&#39;ll go away.<br/>\nYes, that&#39;s true.<br/>\nBut first they might do some REAL damage to themselves or others.<br/>\nAnd the parent will have done irreparable damage to the relationship between <br/>\nherself and the children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I called the police a few times and they ignored me, I would stop doing it <br/>\nso much.  But is that the role of safety officers, to ignore calls for help?  <br/>\nI think a mother&#39;s prime job is the immediate safety of her young children.   <br/>\nChildren who are treated as this suggestion recommends, ignored by the adults <br/>\naround them, might NEVER be as safe when they&#39;re out and about as those who <br/>\nhave been helped to develop sensible solutions to disagreements, based on p<br/>\nrinciples of consideration and peaceful interactions and safe behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe distraction and humor suggestion isn&#39;t so bad, but it seems a trick for <br/>\nthe use of a mom who HAS no better ideas than to turn clownish.  And the <br/>\ndispute between the kids wasn&#39;t resolved at all, and when it comes up again they&#39;ll <br/>\nknow no more than they do this time about how to make peace or to get help <br/>\nwhen the problem is beyond their three- or five- or ten-year-old understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think first that there&#39;s a deep problem in wording.  &quot;Tattling&quot; has a bad <br/>\nconnotation, and &quot;tattling is bad.&quot;  &quot;Tattlers&quot; are bad.   So I have never ever <br/>\nused that word with my kids.   If they want to tell me about a problem <br/>\nthey&#39;re having, or report something that scared them or that they didn&#39;t know how to <br/>\nhandle, that&#39;s WONDERFUL.  That&#39;s what our relationship has been about <br/>\nalways.  It&#39;s not &quot;tattling&quot; to come and say &quot;Marc is throwing sand in the babies&#39; <br/>\neyes&quot; at the park.  It&#39;s not &quot;tattling&quot; to say &quot;Laurie has my bike and won&#39;t <br/>\ngive it back.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf an adult was being pelted with rocks (the equivalent of sand to babies), <br/>\nor someone had his car and wouldn&#39;t give it back, the police would be there <br/>\npretty quickly.  They wouldn&#39;t respond to a 911 call with &quot;Don&#39;t tattle.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo these special &quot;ignore it&quot; rules for children are just another way to treat <br/>\nthem as less than fully human, and I don&#39;t like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101564,"nextTopicId":101567}}
