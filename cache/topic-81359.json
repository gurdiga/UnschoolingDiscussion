He was/is an oddity, everyone looked out <br/>\nfor him and whispered under their breath about the &quot;poor child&quot; and his lack of <br/>\ncaring parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt ten he would be found five miles out in town at night on his bicycle <br/>\nordering a child&#39;s meal from the Ruby Tuesdays eating alone.  Some kind neighbor <br/>\nwould put the bike in their car and drive him back home in the dark.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe police took this kid home so much they got tired of it.  Ten years ago <br/>\nour Police Force was kinder, today they have no patience for that kind of thing <br/>\nand parents get in big trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, the kid who &quot;raised&quot; himself, he&#39;s gets plenty of attention these days <br/>\nfrom the police force, he&#39;s their guest for the third time in two years, this <br/>\ntime for about 18 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say that young children do play in our neighborhood, but there are <br/>\nalways parents who are in the yard, on the porch, in the kitchen with the door <br/>\nopen.  Maybe because we are in a residential neighborhood and no commercial <br/>\nactivity goes on it&#39;s more tolerated.  Maybe they figure if you&#39;re on your street <br/>\nand your Mom knows where you are it&#39;s OK.  If they wander much farther than <br/>\ntheir own street, someone is likely to call someone and usually not the parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Police Scare today","postDate":"1064410993","msgId":81397,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwOTI0LjA3NDMxNC43OTIuNS5kZHppbWxld0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":81395,"nextInTopic":81398,"prevInTime":81396,"nextInTime":81398,"topicId":81359,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Six and seven is really young to be out without adults, isn t it? *** Maybe it depends where you live.

It takes awhile of loitering <br/>\nbefore someone calls to report children to the police and takes time for the <br/>\nofficer to respond and question the boys, all the while no mother comes <br/>\ncalling or looking for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s probably what they were so interested in.

Someone at that business <br/>\ncalled the police and the police picked the boys up and came to the <br/>\ndoor.  For some reason the boys told the officer I wasn&#39;t home, <br/>\nprobably not wanting to get into trouble.  He said if he didn&#39;t find <br/>\nme at home he was going to call FIA.  Then he started complaining <br/>\nthat they aren&#39;t in school and don&#39;t know anything, etc, etc.  I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t believe what I was hearing and what was happening, as the <br/>\nboys hadn&#39;t been outside more than 10 to 15 minutes.  He wanted <br/>\ntheir names, ages, my name and phone number and how many kids I had, <br/>\nI gave him the info. and told him they were privately schooled (we <br/>\nlive in Michigan).  I&#39;m not sure if I should have gave him that <br/>\ninfo., as I couldn&#39;t think at the time.  He gave me and the boys a <br/>\nlecture and finally let them out of his car for me to take inside.  <br/>\nI kept telling him I needed to go, as I had an infant that was <br/>\nsleeping inside, but he kept going on and on.<br/>\n     The thing that gets me is our society expects children to be <br/>\nlocked up between certain hours of the day and if kids are out <br/>\nduring that time frame, people get up in arms about it.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to feel like I have to lock my kids up during school hours, but <br/>\nI don&#39;t like dealing with situations like what happened today either.<br/>\n     There&#39;s some kids my sons age that runs all over town, all of <br/>\nthe time,outside of school hours and the police never pick them up.  <br/>\nThey walk across town to play with my kids, because I won&#39;t let my <br/>\nkids outside the yard without supervision.  Here I am, the cautious <br/>\nparent and I get hasseled just because my kids happened to venture <br/>\noutside the gate during school hours.  My husband just happened to <br/>\nbe on the part of his mail route that comes near our home when he <br/>\nsaw the officer leaving.  He came home worried something had <br/>\nhappened to one of us, only to find out the above.  He wasn&#39;t only <br/>\nup-set that the boys left the yard without permission, but that the <br/>\npolice were even called.  Why do people feel they need to meddle?  <br/>\nNow, I feel like I can&#39;t let my kids outside during the day, even in <br/>\ntheir own yard and I&#39;m worried this officer is going to watch our <br/>\nplace and call FIA if he see the kids out to often, so I&#39;m <br/>\nfrustrated!  What would you do?  I want to move now.<br/>\nRobin   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81596,"nextTopicId":81540}}
