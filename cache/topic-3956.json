The guest speaker (a really nice guy) was Prof Peter<br/>\nFleming, an expert in infant development, talking about safety in infant<br/>\nsleep.  The gist of the research he shared with us is that &#39;full&#39;<br/>\nco-sleeping, ie, having baby in your bed (or you in his) 100% of the time,<br/>\nis protective against SIDS, UNLESS one or both parents smoke, or have drunk<br/>\nalcohol, which are BIG risk factors.  Room-sharing is protective whether<br/>\nparents smoke or drink or not, but having baby in a seperate room is a risk.<br/>\nUsing duvets is a risk, but babies were only found with covers over their<br/>\nheads in cots.  Parents awareness of potential overheating is protective<br/>\nagainst SIDS.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome sleep lab research found that babies who were co-sleeping, even though<br/>\nthe air temperatue around their bodies was higher, they had lower core<br/>\ntemperatures than the cot-sleeping babies.  The sleep lab research also<br/>\nshowed that even in mothers who did not regularly co-sleep, sleep patterns<br/>\nmatched their babies,&#39; meaning that the babies&#39; wakeful periods coincided<br/>\nwith the mothers,&#39; instead of disrupting her pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\n Co-sleeping on sofas is a BIG risk, (perhaps not of SIDS, but of<br/>\nsuffocation) but the possible circumstances of co-sleeping on sofas, ie<br/>\npossible drunkenness, extreme tiredness, social depravation (ie lack of bed)<br/>\nmay contrbute greater than the actual sofa itself.  (But softness of sleep<br/>\nsurface is an issue too)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and BTW, Prof Fleming was at the CPSC meeting when the data which the<br/>\nrecent report condemning co-sleeping as unsafe was received, and he decried<br/>\nthe report as utterly unsound, there was no depth to the data, no analysis,<br/>\nand it was not appropriate to publish such a strong statement either for or<br/>\nagainst any sleeping practices based on this data.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this clears a few things up/ sets minds at ease.  Oh, and the study<br/>\nonly covered children up to 1yo, and most deaths occured between 2 and 3mo,<br/>\nand between 5 and 10am, particularly between 6 and 7am.  I can go into<br/>\ngreater detail, but since the research hasn&#39;t been published yet, I didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to put the whole lot &#39;over the wires&#39; as it were.  Anyone who wants to<br/>\nknow has only to ask :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3950,"nextTopicId":3954}}
