The pertinent line was offered, immediately <br/>\nfollowed by the full paragraph.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day Holly said that although people will sometimes address her as <br/>\n&quot;young lady,&quot; nobody ever addresses anyone as &quot;old woman,&quot; but I told her <br/>\nthey do in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

It&#39;s a marvel. <br/>\n Any of you with any interest in that should just buy it, do not pass go, <br/>\ndon&#39;t bother to rent it.  It has HOURS of special features and extras.  Days <br/>\nof fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis afternoon I was sewing and listening to the voiceover commentary by John <br/>\nCleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin.  (There&#39;s another whole voiceover by <br/>\nTerry Gilliam and Terry Jones, who were the directors.)   There are two <br/>\nscenes in Japanese, with subtitles of the Japanese translated back into <br/>\nEnglish.   There&#39;s more than I can tell here, on two disks, but anyway, I was <br/>\nimpressed by how intellectual the whole discussion was in some places.   <br/>\nSometimes what seems unimportant or silly is really the weighty core of an <br/>\nentire discussion or piece of art or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Context&quot; itself means with the surrounding information, either literal <br/>\n(writing) or conversational, visual, social or emotional.  It&#39;s like &quot;in <br/>\nsitu,&quot; for archeologists.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s an important concept for kids to understand, as unschoolers are learning <br/>\nin context and not separate from life.  Watching this Holy Grail DVD, it&#39;s <br/>\ncool to see commentary in context (in the presence of the movie being played) <br/>\nby people who are describing what happened in context (remembering back to <br/>\nthe time of the filming and discussing the political, financial, artistic and <br/>\nsocial realities of the early 1970&#39;s).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-And it wasn&#39;t out of context.  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I wrote that I was thinking of the &quot;I&#39;m NOT a witch&quot; rhythm and delivery.<br/>\n<br/>\nBEDEVERE:<br/>\nHow do you know she is a witch?<br/>\nVILLAGER #2:<br/>\nShe looks like one.<br/>\nCROWD:<br/>\nRight!
