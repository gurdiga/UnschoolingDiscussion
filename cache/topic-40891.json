I  have been <br/>\nunschooling for several years, ever since I found that &quot;school at <br/>\nhome&quot; doesn&#39;t work for our relaxed and versatile family <br/>\nenvironment.  Since little ones join our family every two years or <br/>\nso and we are a family-bedding, nursing on demand, no vaccinations, <br/>\nhomeschooling in the country family, unschooling seems to be the <br/>\nonly way for our family to learn.  I had hoped to feel a little <br/>\nless &quot;weird&quot; by joining this list, and I have to say I have loved <br/>\nthe posts the last couple of weeks and feel among kindred spirits, <br/>\nso to speak.  With Ned, because of his strong beliefs that might <br/>\nannoy others. (I annoy many non-homeschoolers or even mothers who <br/>\nvaccinate because of MY strong beliefs) With Sandra and Mary, <br/>\nbecause of their strong beliefs in their children&#39;s learning from <br/>\nlife.  With all of you because of our common interests.  <br/>\nThat said, I also love a good debate. I&#39;m sorry, but being at home <br/>\nall day with five children (we have 7, two out on thier own)means I <br/>\nhave very little adult human contact and I truly crave adult <br/>\nconversation, albeit via the Internet.   I subscribe to magazines <br/>\nfor the same reason, my interests ranging from  &quot;Brain Child&quot; <br/>\n(magazine for thinking mothers) to &quot;Family Foundations&quot; (magazine <br/>\nfor couples using natural family planning, or in our case, God&#39;s <br/>\nFamily Planning), and of course, my favorite homeschooling magazine <br/>\n(and the only one I subscribe to!) &quot;Home Education&quot;.  I crave mind <br/>\nstimulation even more than I crave chocolate!   <br/>\nI may have missed much of the arguing, have only been reading these <br/>\nposts for two weeks, but I sensed a kindred spirit in Ned very <br/>\nquickly as I once belonged to a list for mothers at home which I was <br/>\nthe one being asked to leave by a couple of others because my ideas <br/>\nabout homeschooling offended them.  Somehow, my passion for <br/>\nhomeschooling and unschooling left them feeling very defensive about <br/>\ntheir own choices to send their children to school.  After leaving <br/>\ntheir group I wrote an essay about this very thing, how some of my <br/>\nfledgling friendships have not survived the differences in our life <br/>\nchoices.  Too many mothers assume that because I have chosen <br/>\nhomeschooling, or allowing God to plan our family, that I must <br/>\nbelieve their different choices are WRONG.  I do not believe that.  <br/>\nI do what works for my family, and those who feel defensive about my <br/>\nchoices must not be comfortable in their own.<br/>\nWhat does this have to do with Ned?  Well, after awhile, some <br/>\nmembers of thsi previous group took everything and everything <br/>\nI &quot;said&quot; in a negative tone, even when I was back-pedalling fast and <br/>\ntrying to make things right with them.  Nothing I said was looked on <br/>\nin a positive light. I hope that after a recent posting of Ned&#39;s, <br/>\neveryone will give him the benefit of the doubt and &quot;listen&quot; to what <br/>\nhe is saying.   He must be a very passionate person about his <br/>\nbeliefs, and that is a wonderful thing.  And those who have taken <br/>\noffense must be very passionate as well.  I love that high interest <br/>\nand intelligence in people and hope to continue to see it on this <br/>\nlist.  But I truly hope one person will not be kicked off the list <br/>\nfor a bad choice of words or an all-consuming passion, or I might be <br/>\nnext for not vaccinating my children!  :o)   (or, at least, in <br/>\nchoosing *fighting words* to villify my beliefs!)<br/>\nBy the way, I&#39;m 42, and I kind of thought &quot;wussy&quot; just meant someone <br/>\nnot real brave, or that wouldn&#39;t stand up for what they believe!<br/>\nThanks to all of you for your stimulating conversations lately. <br/>\nMary from IA (to distinguish myself from the other Mary that posts <br/>\nregularly on here)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40870,"nextTopicId":40892}}
