But if someone wants to do something that <br/>\nbothers another person I will ask them to stop, and if they choose to <br/>\ncontinue a harmful behavior I will TELL them to stop. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had an example of telling someone to do something two nights ago.  I was <br/>\nsleeping in a reclining-chair-end of a couch (&quot;Kirby&#39;s couch&quot; which he got for <br/>\nhelping some people move), and Holy was sleeping next to me on the rest of the <br/>\ncouch.  I have pneumonia/bronchitis/something nasty and couldn&#39;t sleep lying <br/>\ndown for a couple of nights).   Marty had been upstairs in Kirby&#39;s room on the <br/>\ncomputer.  I woke up when he was coming downstairs, and he was turning lights <br/>\noff in the kitchen and such up there, and when he got to his room he hadn&#39;t <br/>\nturned off the light on the stairs, and it wasn&#39;t RIGHT in my face, but it was <br/>\nbright.  I said &quot;Marty, turn the light off on the stairs.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t ask him nicely, I just told him.   I didn&#39;t say it mean, and I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t say it loudly because I didn&#39;t want to wake Holly up.  I didn&#39;t add extra <br/>\nwords for the same reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said &quot;I&#39;d rather leave it on.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah.  That&#39;s his nightlight.  He leaves the door to his room open, and <br/>\nthat light on the stairs makes light on the wall he sees from his bed.  I had <br/>\nforgotten, for a minute.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said &quot;Okay,&quot; and I turned over the other way a little and went back to <br/>\nsleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that I couldn&#39;t go to sleep with it on.  I had gone to sleep before <br/>\nwith a big fire in the fireplace, Totoro on TV, and that light on on the <br/>\nstairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I was the one sleeping in &quot;the wrong place.&quot;  I have a darker room.   So <br/>\nbeing more in Marty&#39;s territory, I let him make that call.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85444,"nextTopicId":85417}}
