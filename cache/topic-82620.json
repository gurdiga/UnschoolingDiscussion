Not so <br/>\nmuch about if my kids will learn but more about am I providing <br/>\nenough experiences, time, etc. with them so that they have the <br/>\nopportunity to learn.  That is one thing I am working on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, in the midst of all my angst I got to see my sons true <br/>\nbrightness that occurs when left to his own devices.  Me and the <br/>\nboys went to the bookstore today.  As I was looking for something, <br/>\nmy 5yo saw a science book and said &quot;Look, maybe we can study <br/>\nscience.&quot;  I named a few areas in science to explain that science <br/>\nwas a general word for many different fields of science.  One I <br/>\nmentioned was magnets and he grasps at that one.  I said okay but <br/>\nnot thinking it would go past that because he usually doesn&#39;t.  He <br/>\ngoes to Thomas the Train and says &quot;Look Mom, Thomas has magnets.  I <br/>\nam going to study magnets over here.&quot;  So, her played for about 1/2 <br/>\nhour and learned some rudimentary magnet facts along the way.  That <br/>\ntwo sides stick and the other sides don&#39;t go together and &quot;when you <br/>\nhold these like this (a bit apart) they pop together&quot;.  Talk about <br/>\nhating my input and just enjoying his own process!  I just sit and <br/>\nwatch because he pretty much is at that &quot;I know&quot; stage.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, he was playing a game on his computer and wanted me to join <br/>\nhim.  He was collecting scarrabs and had 7.  I casually asked how <br/>\nmany more he needed to get 10, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s easy Mom&quot;.  He starts <br/>\ncounting on his fingers from 1.  At this point I think he is going <br/>\nto get confused because by the time he gets to 7 and than to 10 he <br/>\nwill probably lose count somewhere.  He count&quot; 1, 2, 3&quot; and says &quot;3 <br/>\nmore&quot;.  I am still trying to figure out how he got the answer!  Was <br/>\nhe counting from 7 to 10 in his head while counting 1-3 on his <br/>\nfingers?  He did the same thing at the doctor&#39;s office a few months <br/>\nback when I was giving him really easy problems while we were bored <br/>\nand waiting.  He was answering basic math problems with no fingers, <br/>\nall in his head.  I have found if he is relaxed and we are just <br/>\nhanging out playing, he can answer math problems easily.  If we are <br/>\nbusy and he is distracted, he just answers with &quot;I &#39;don&#39;t know&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a great day to see that he is doing fine!!  It got me <br/>\nthinking about how we teach kids to do math a certain way and that <br/>\nmight not work for them.
