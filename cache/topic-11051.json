(We NEED a job, I might add...almost a <br/>\nyear of earnestly seeking employment is getting old!)  One job is on Cook <br/>\nInlet, the other two are rotational on the north slope.  I anticipate that <br/>\nboth north slope jobs would have him going alone and flying home during time <br/>\noff.  Having never been there or done this sort of thing, I&#39;d be interested <br/>\nif anyone has info on whether that is typically how things are done and if so <br/>\n(or not) any suggestions on what to expect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand the homeschool laws are quite favorable in AK.  We&#39;ve wanted to <br/>\nmove there for over 20 years and it appears to be a real possibility this <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can you tell me about actual living conditions?  What to look out for <br/>\nand what to look forward to? <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a medical condition...FMS (fibromyalgia syndrome).  If anyone has <br/>\nfirst hand experience on how living in very cold weather affects them or <br/>\nsomeone they know with FMS, that would be very helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nCost of living...I understand is high...?  Is housing hard to find?  I would <br/>\nassume homes are pretty well insulated against the cold?  We would have to <br/>\nrent, if that makes any difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there are zillions of questions I should ask, but beyond these, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know where to start!  so, any information is helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11017,"nextTopicId":11052}}
