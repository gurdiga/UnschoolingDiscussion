In an effort to avoid<br/>\n     coercing our children (and ourselves), we strive to find and/or<br/>\n     create &quot;common preferences&quot;: solutions to problems that *all*<br/>\n     parties prefer and are completely happy with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From the TCS website:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>     TCS is a theory about what to do in the face of conflict. Building<br/>\n     family relationships based entirely on consent, rather than<br/>\n     coercion, seems to us to be the only approach that offers a<br/>\n     solution to the problem of conventional coercive child-rearing. The<br/>\n<br/>\n     problem? People get hurt. As a result of this hurt people are<br/>\n     unable or less able to solve problems in their lives. The idea of<br/>\n     people hurting each other is, according to conventional wisdom,<br/>\n     part of everyday life. But we think it is caused by people devoting<br/>\n<br/>\n     their ingenuity to hurting each other and thwarting one other&#39;s<br/>\n     attempts to solve anything. TCS non-coercive educational theory is<br/>\n     a way of addressing such problems wholesale, by setting up a<br/>\n     different framework in which they can be solved more easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n           ...TCS represents a profound criticism of prevailing theories<br/>\n<br/>\n     of education and parenting, and provides a positive alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\n           ...TCS is characterized by a style of decision making that<br/>\n     bypasses coercion in favour of finding common preferences<br/>\n     (unanimous consent). With the TCS approach, children spend their<br/>\n     childhoods without anyone making them do things against their will<br/>\n     or anyone doing things to them against their will.<br/>\n<br/>\n           TCS rejects the discipline is an expression of love dogma<br/>\n     that permeates conventional coercive parenting. Feeling love for<br/>\n     another person does not confer the right to act towards them in a<br/>\n     way that would be wrong if you did not love them. Love is no<br/>\n     justification for tyranny.<br/>\n<br/>\n     TCS also provides the theory behind the practice that allows<br/>\n     parents to persevere in the face of difficult situations where they<br/>\n<br/>\n     would otherwise be tempted to choose coercion.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out these websites:<br/>\nThe Taking Children Seriously website<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/index.html\">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGentle Spirit NCP forum<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gentlespirit.com/cgi-bin/dcforum/dcboard.cgi?az=list&forum=Protected\">http://www.gentlespirit.com/cgi-bin/dcforum/dcboard.cgi?az=list&forum=Protected</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe TCS discussion at unschooling.com (this is an interesting debate.)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/84/1299.html?MondayFebruary2620011226am\">http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/84/1299.html?MondayFebruary2620011226am</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Anderson-Thimmes<br/>\n<br/>\nJohanna wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; As we used to say &quot;question authority&quot; Heck, question everything.
