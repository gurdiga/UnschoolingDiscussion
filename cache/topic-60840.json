That  doesn&#39;t <br/>\nreally answer your question, though.<br/>\n <br/>\nOne thing I do is limit the amount of clothes Will has to what will fit in  <br/>\nhis drawer.  (Since kids grow so fast, it&#39;s easy to cull out the too-smalls  <br/>\nwhen you buy new undies.)  So there&#39;s one small drawer with his boxers  stacked <br/>\non top of each other, not folded, just laid out flat.  And then  there&#39;s only <br/>\nthe socks that can fit in the other small drawer.  Shorts in  the next drawer, <br/>\nand his shorts are much longer now so I can only fit 4 or 5 in  there, and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t fold them small...just lay them out folded in half.   (The last drawer <br/>\nholds all his baseball uniform shirts and hats from the 8  previous <br/>\nseasons--we&#39;re saving them for his Hall of Fame display.   lol.)  His t-shirts are <br/>\nhanging on hangers in the closet.  He has many  more t-shirts than anything else.  <br/>\nSome are sentimental so we can&#39;t get rid  of them.  When he was smaller, he <br/>\ncould pull t-shirts off the hanger just  by yanking on the t-shirt.  <br/>\n <br/>\nPants are another matter.  I hang them on hangers because there&#39;s no  other <br/>\nplace.  But I still have to go dig them out of the closet for him  like I did <br/>\nwhen he was short, because they get swallowed up by the  t-shirts.  If it were <br/>\nmy closet, I would have all the pants on one side and  all the t-shirts on <br/>\nanother.  But, he puts his own clothes away now and I&#39;m  not going to enforce <br/>\nthat for him.  So, when he needs a particular pair of  pants, I go upstairs and <br/>\ndig them out.  I don&#39;t mind.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy middle son could never stay organized.  He just had a big dresser  with <br/>\nnothing folded at all.  I sorted his socks, undies, t-shirts and what  have you <br/>\ninto piles, and he just dumped them into the appropriate drawers.   It was <br/>\nokay with him, so it was okay with me.  Ironically, his pants were  always hung <br/>\nup neatly in the closet.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n <br/>\nwww.badchair.net<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201436708,"authorName":"arcarpenter2003","from":"&quot;arcarpenter2003&quot; &lt;arcarpenter@...&gt;","profile":"arcarpenter2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Help needed","postDate":"1116664648","msgId":106049,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ2bXMwOCtubzc5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNGEwMWM1NWRjNCQ0NzM5NTUwMCRiODI5Yjk0NEBob21lPg=="},"prevInTopic":106048,"nextInTopic":106051,"prevInTime":106048,"nextInTime":106050,"topicId":60840,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...  wrote: == Can anybody share new ideas for storing children s clothing?

My son recently rode a<br/>\nski lift with some high schooled boys who were off school for a snow day.<br/>\n(We go skiing every Tuesday, because every day is a snow day!)  Afterwards<br/>\nhe started asking me if he was going to go to high school (they told him he<br/>\nShould).  Then he said he thought we should do more &quot;school&quot; because he&#39;s<br/>\nworried about being uneducated!  The most helpful thing I could think of to<br/>\ndo was to try to explain certain aspects of unschooling to him.  We<br/>\ndiscussed how memorizing facts for a test wasn&#39;t really education, and how<br/>\nhe&#39;s learning all the time-when we watch t.v. shows, read or listen to<br/>\nbooks, have discussions about all kinds of topics and through play.  I<br/>\nexplained to him that some people think learing isn&#39;t really learning unless<br/>\nthere is a schedule involved, a teacher and a student, testing, grading,<br/>\netc.  Fortunately he knew better! We then discussed the fact that these boys<br/>\ndidn&#39;t seem to &quot;approve&quot; of homeschooling!  Could it be that they didn&#39;t<br/>\napprove because they know nothing about homeschooling?  It&#39;s hard to form an<br/>\naccurate opinion without all the facts.  Could it be that they were jealous?<br/>\nThey can&#39;t take off school and go skiing whenever they want.  And lastly we<br/>\ndiscussed the question-Does it matter to us what they think?  (We think<br/>\nnot!)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck,<br/>\nMarjorie<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;ibhayi.afrika&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ibhayi.afrika@...\">ibhayi.afrika@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 12, 2003 3:59 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Help needed<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Coming out of lurkdom here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We live in the UK ( waves to Shyrley ) and at the moment are being<br/>\nbombarded<br/>\n&gt; by govt. propaganda about the importance of sending your child to school<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; the problems with truancy.
