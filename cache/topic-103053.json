Their powers of concentration developed as naturally as breathing. Good readers became very good readers, even as men and women who go in for weight-lifting will bulk up. The connection between loving to read and doing well in school was no mystery to most students.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery parent has had the experience of picking up a 2- or 3-year-old who is busy at play. All too often, a tantrum occurs. Even as adults, we have to learn to contain our annoyance when our thoughts are broken into. For a child, an interruption to one&#39;s concentration can prove as painful as a verbal rebuke.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI said at book group that I didn&#39;t think Mailer supported his premise in the article, but several other women in the group vehemently agreed that TV causes people to read less and agreed that commercials do cause short attention spans.  It wasn&#39;t the main topic of our discussion, so no more was said about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI though about it later and a couple of things came to mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The article was written by an &quot;expert&quot;, therefore the information should be considered accurate.  Norman Mailer - after all, isn&#39;t a successful published writer an &quot;expert&quot; in reading and writing?  Never mind that there is no actual research or evidence to support his statements - 25% decrease in books read annually among high school students and young adults.  How did they gather that data?  And the children who read &quot;for hours&quot; 60 years ago?  Who was keeping track?<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  We have no way of knowing how much these &quot;high school students and young adults&quot; would have read if they&#39;d lived before TV.  I suspect there have always been people who did not spend a lot of time reading.  Some people enjoy sitting with a book, others prefer to do other things.  The supposed decline in reading is blamed on TV, when we don&#39;t even know that there actually is a long term decline in reading.  It seems to me, based on bookstores and the popularity of book groups, that reading is alive and well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nwww.aupairfoundation.org <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103112,"nextTopicId":103049}}
