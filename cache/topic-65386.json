As most of you know, we have <br/>\n  had our son out of PS for about a year and since then he has had no <br/>\n  contact with any children. When I came to this list, we were having <br/>\n  him write to children online and pushing him to be around other <br/>\n  children. Since my first week here I took the plunge into unschooling <br/>\n  (thanks to many of you) and have read day and night, every day, <br/>\n  anything and everything I can about unschooling (and still do). I <br/>\n  threw out restrictions, bedtime, punishment even the therapist&lt;g&gt; all <br/>\n  at once. I have to say it was such a drastic change that it left my <br/>\n  husband and the dog confused! Our son really loves it. We laid off our <br/>\n  son about his fear & anger of children and our need for him to be <br/>\n  around or write to children. This past week he came to us on his own <br/>\n  and said, Mom, I was thinking I may like to have my friend Chris over, <br/>\n  do you think he&#39;ll come over even though I wouldn&#39;t let him before? I <br/>\n  said I didn&#39;t know, he could give him a call if he liked and I left <br/>\n  the room (holding my breath). When I came back he was just hanging up <br/>\n  the phone and said, he&#39;s coming over Thursday. When yesterday came, <br/>\n  you would think our son saw a ghost. He was so scared. He hasn&#39;t <br/>\n  played with another child in a year. His friend came and a bit after <br/>\n  our son was okay and he was so happy. I can&#39;t tell you the happiness I <br/>\n  felt watching my son run around outside in the sun with his friend, <br/>\n  laughing and just being a kid again. I can&#39;t tell you how choked up I <br/>\n  was after his friend left and he said to me, mom thanks for letting me <br/>\n  go about things in my own way, I love my old mom but I really love my <br/>\n  new mom. He invited another friend to come over today. Just thought <br/>\n  I&#39;d share with the list that helped make that happen.
