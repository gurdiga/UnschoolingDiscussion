They play with them differently than my<br/>\ndaughter does, but they do enjoy them.<br/>\nI never encouraged them to play with or hid dolls from them.  They both want<br/>\ncarriers and beds for their babies.  Hubby slightly disapproves, but not enough<br/>\nto say anything.  I think his feelings are just throw backs to the way he was<br/>\nraised.  He&#39;s learning  :)<br/>\nMy four yr old in particular is very nurturing.  I love seeing him like this.<br/>\nHe is also the one that is *ell on wheels too!
