One of them is Clonlara School, which has an extremely flexible<br/>\nprogram distance-learning program leading to a high school diploma (from a<br/>\nprivate school, which may avoid the stigma sometimes carried by the GED).<br/>\nSome kids go directly to college, sometimes first taking a course or two at<br/>\na local community college with an open admissions policy. Some go freestyle<br/>\ninto adult life  no diplomas at all. Read Dawn by Robin Graham, a teen who<br/>\nsailed around the world alone. Keep your mind open to the endless<br/>\npossibilities.

What&#39;s a <br/>\n  &gt; CHARGE <br/>\n  &gt; syndrome child?<br/>\n  &gt; Tia<br/>\n<br/>\n  CHARGE is an acronym for a set of birth defects,  the letters coming from<br/>\n  some of the most common features.<br/>\n  C  is for coloboma ( cleft of the eyeball ), causing vision loss or<br/>\n  blindness and cranial nerves a kind of facial palsy, swallowing problems,<br/>\n  nerve damage, etc.<br/>\n  H  heart defects<br/>\n  A  artresia of the choanae, (nose and throat passage<br/>\n  deformities)affecting breathing.<br/>\n  R  retardation of growth development <br/>\n  G genital and urinary abnormalities<br/>\n  E  Ear  abnormalities and hearing loss.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There are usually other problems but these are the most common.  It is<br/>\n  genetic.<br/>\n  It occurs in about 1 in 12000 births, affecting all races, boys and girls<br/>\n  equally.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A little boy with CHARGE syndrome may be coming to live with us.  I&#39;m<br/>\n  taking a crash course.  He&#39;s seven and has no effective way to<br/>\n  communicate that his care givers now can understand.  ( I don&#39;t know why<br/>\n  he doesn&#39;t sign,  and since he&#39;s  deaf,  doctors may have incorrectly<br/>\n  diagnosed mental retardation. )  He&#39;s been in the hospital most of his<br/>\n  young life.  Unschooling will be the way to go as the ps  system has said<br/>\n  they won&#39;t take him.  He was described to us as having severe behavioral<br/>\n  problems.  We&#39;re scrambling to learn as much as we can.  I&#39;m finding a<br/>\n  great deal of information actually, just wondered about personal stories.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n  Deb L<br/>\n<br/>\n  Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n  Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
