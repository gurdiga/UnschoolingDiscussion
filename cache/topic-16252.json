My husband&#39;s buying a sword next week for someone <br/>\nwho&#39;s being knighted--a gift and a part of the ceremony.  There are swords <br/>\nall around me, not usually sharpened, but still deadly.  Nobody&#39;s gotten hurt <br/>\nby them except one friend (with his own sword) in Dixon, New Mexico (a town <br/>\nfamous for apples) who was slicing apples in the air with a Japanese sword <br/>\nfor fun and accidently cut his own foot badly).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you cut apples in the air (I have learned), here are some safety rules:  <br/>\nKeep both feet on the ground, and have someone else toss the apples.
