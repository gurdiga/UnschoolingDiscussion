This is my FAVORITE part of homeschooling.  Sometimes, the boys just aren&#39;t going to do what I have in mind....usually, for my family, this is a sign they need some physical activity....so it is out the door we go for a bike ride, walk or rollar blading.  If it is raining, we will put on the dancin&#39; music and get silly together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis drives my dh nuts.  When he makes &#39;plans&#39; he wants to stick to them.  For some things, we have to stick to the plan (like a scheduled outing or party or some such thing).  But if it is a day that we were going to actually be home...I prefer to be flexible.  Sometimes I don&#39;t feel like doing certain things...and when I force myself, I am miserable.  I try not to do this to the kids (&#39;cuz then they make ME miserable!!  *G*)<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Karen<br/>\n***********************************<br/>\nKaren & David Hoogland ï¿½<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kdhoogland@...\">kdhoogland@...</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------<br/>\nCheck out our Webpages!!<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.tripod.com/~Hoagys/index.html\">http://members.tripod.com/~Hoagys/index.html</a><br/>\n  Updated 8/9/99<br/>\n-----------------------------------------<br/>\nIf a man was to go so far into a forest that a woman could<br/>\nnot hear him speak, would he still be wrong?  <br/>\n----------------------------------------<br/>\n  Homeschoolers2000 Email List: To subscribe, go to<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/homeschoolers2000\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/homeschoolers2000</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2296,"nextTopicId":2378}}
