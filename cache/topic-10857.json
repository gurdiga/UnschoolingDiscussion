I do have a child who <br/>\nis older t than  my 3 yo.  He will be 6 in Sept, and is a little bit better <br/>\nabout helping to clean...but not a whole lot.  He is more or less <br/>\ninconsistent attitude-wise when it comes time to clean.  Maybe he&#39;s crossing <br/>\nout of one phase into another.  :)  Sounds like your son did a great job <br/>\ntaking care of his mess in the kitchen!  I look forward to that!  :)  ~Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10832,"nextTopicId":10856}}
