I said before he went I wanted him to watch The Adventures of <br/>\nPriscilla, Queen of the Desert--that it would make the show much more fun for <br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he agreed.  He, Marty, Holly, Brett (another unschooling regular, since <br/>\n3rd grade, often at our house) and I sat down and watched it.  Holly had seen <br/>\nit.  So I wanted them to notice Guy Pearce, who plays the youngest of the <br/>\ndrag queens, and also the bad guy in the Count of Monte Cristo (also the lead <br/>\nin Memento, which only Marty and I had seen, and which is a disturbing <br/>\nmovie).   What I did NOT know is that the other two drag-queen-playing actors <br/>\nwere recognizeable to the boys.  One was in the Matrix (Hugo Weaving)--Kirby <br/>\npointed that one out.  And although I knew but couldn&#39;t picture Terrence <br/>\nStamp in Superman III, Marty sat up straight when the show was almost over <br/>\nand said &quot;I have seen him in another movie--he played someone&#39;s teacher.&quot;  <br/>\nAfter agitating and searching his memory banks, he dug up &quot;Young Guns&quot; out of <br/>\nthe basket of westerns his dad gathered up for him for research purposes  <br/>\n(for an RPG he&#39;s making with Brett), and sure enough--stuck it in and we saw <br/>\nnearly the same phrase and gesture he had recognized in &quot;Bernadette.&quot;  Then <br/>\nwe put in the Matrix video and took a look at THAT very different character!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was some weird family togetherness, but it was a lot of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33913,"nextTopicId":35001}}
