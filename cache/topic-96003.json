One I&#39;d never even heard of, so I ordered it but it will be <br/>\nway down the queue.    That&#39;s fine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did look it up online, though, and the reviews are fascinating, and there&#39;s <br/>\neven an official site with some images.   A couple of paragraphs from a <br/>\nreview are below, and the documentary is &quot;Hell House&quot;:<br/>\n<br/>\n--------. . .George Ratcliffe&#39;s documentary &quot;Hell House&quot; chronicles the <br/>\ndamnedest thing I&#39;ve seen in ages (pun intended): for the past ten years, the <br/>\nTrinity Christian School in Cedar Hill, Texas, has presented &quot;Hell House&quot;, <br/>\nliterally, a house of horrors tour depicting not the fictitious evils of witches and <br/>\nzombies, but the very real &quot;sins&quot; of drugs, AIDS, suicide, abortion, incest, <br/>\nand school violence (Trinity&#39;s graphic Columbine scene drew record crowds in <br/>\n1999).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFocusing on last year&#39;s &quot;Hell House X&quot;, Ratcliffe presents a remarkably fair <br/>\nlook at the event&#39;s conceptualization, rehearsal, construction, and eventual <br/>\nOctober 31 presentation, complete with the usual backstage technical gaffes (a <br/>\nStar Of David mistakenly drawn for a Pentagram) and mixed response from an <br/>\naudience that is not always willing to echo the performers&#39; rather rigid <br/>\nsentiment. Subplots focus on specific participants, most memorably, a &quot;stage father&quot;, <br/>\nsingle after his wife has left him for a chatroom lover, who lovingly dotes on <br/>\nhis children and even allows his personal trauma as a basis for one of the <br/>\nsketches. One gets a sense that &quot;Hell House&quot; is as much a cathartic release for <br/>\nCedar Hill&#39;s teens (many are eager to participate in the Rave rape sketch, if <br/>\nfor no other reason than to &quot;get to dance&quot;), as it is a pageant of some rather <br/>\nhysterical spiritual parables.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95998,"nextTopicId":95977}}
