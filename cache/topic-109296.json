Email me OFFLIST --- please!!<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Put your state in the subject line<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Write a very short blurb (paragraph or two) telling what people  <br/>\nhave to do, to be legal, to unschool in your state.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Provide state support organization information if the organization  <br/>\nis friendly to unschoolers. Provide your OWN information as a contact  <br/>\nperson ONLY if you&#39;re willing to have that information posted on a  <br/>\nwebsite and have people contact you for state-level information.  <br/>\nEMAIL only, please.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want this to all be on the list --- but I&#39;ll post updates and  <br/>\ntell you what states I still need information for --- right now I  <br/>\nneed information for all states other than Texas, California, and  <br/>\nSouth Carolina.  So - if you live in any other state, please send me  <br/>\nthe info.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Pam Sorooshian<br/>\npamsoroosh @ earthlink.net</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109291,"nextTopicId":109316}}
