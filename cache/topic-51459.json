So<br/>\nmany great topics go by and so many cool things happen around here I want<br/>\nto share, but I don&#39;t always find time to post. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been making our Christmas gifts this year and you would not<br/>\nbelieve what the house looks like.   Dylan made bird and bat houses this<br/>\nyear for friends and they are lining the stairs and under the table and<br/>\non the table.   He&#39;s painted them in interesting ways, the one he&#39;s<br/>\npainting this morning looks like a house, with shingles on the roof and a<br/>\nlittle red chimney and windows and doors.   He painted one to look like a<br/>\ncat (don&#39;t know what kind of crazy bird would live in there) one with<br/>\nzebra stripes, one&#39;s psychedelic, (looks like a bad acid trip)   some are<br/>\nplain, for the more conservative bird, and the bat houses all have bats<br/>\non them, of course (baseball bats).    We made some bird houses out of<br/>\ngourds.   I hadn&#39;t done that before, but it was fun.   <br/>\nDavid and Dylan are building a prototype trebuchet.   It is still on the<br/>\nkitchen table, they are having problems adjusting the weights and there<br/>\nis a list on the fridge of things they intend to fling when it&#39;s finally<br/>\nin working order. (Well, it works, but it&#39;s hurling everything backwards)<br/>\n On the list, mashed potatoes, paint balls, jello, left over Halloween<br/>\ncandy, and Spiderman.  Poor Spidey.<br/>\nI have made braided rugs and scarves and one afghan and peanut brittle<br/>\nand almond roca and today, fudge.  <br/>\nToday some friends are coming to help decorate a tree on our front porch,<br/>\nwhich we put up each year in memory of my Dad who died in 2000. (bone<br/>\ncancer)  He loved blue Christmas trees so some of his friends come and my<br/>\nbrother, and we eat and decorate and tell mean stories about my pop. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTomorrow we&#39;re having early Christmas with my mother in law, who will be<br/>\nin Alaska with her other son on the real day, and Dylan has a sparing<br/>\nclinic at his dojo, with Master Kim Sol, a big deal, and he gets in free<br/>\nbecause he helped organize a raffle and bake sale for the club which made<br/>\n$600. dollars!   I told him from now on you can only raise money for ME!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if I don&#39;t get busy now, I&#39;ll be even more behind.  But I appreciate<br/>\nyour kind words and by the way, the feeling is mutual.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"low self esteem?","postDate":"1039798138","msgId":51459,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY5LjI2YjAxNzlhLjJiMmI2OTdhQGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":51463,"prevInTime":51458,"nextInTime":51460,"topicId":51459,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/13/02 10:33:42 AM Central Standard Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1875162171\">In a message dated 12/13/02 10:33:42 AM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; That&#39;s your choice, but there&#39;s no need to give us your cheap <br/>\npsychoanalysis here.
