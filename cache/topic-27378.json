He played with trucks and dolls, he danced and played<br/>\nfootball. When he told his parents, I thought my brother would die. <br/>\nTheir relationship is still stressful.  I have asked my brother what he<br/>\nbelieves a good human being should be.  <br/>\nHis answers, caring, unselfish, helpful, etc.  I remind him these are all<br/>\nthe qualities his son possesses.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey have so much in common.  The love of sports, flying, jumping out of<br/>\nplanes, music, animals.  I just don&#39;t get how this can separate you from<br/>\nsomeone you found so worthy of your love before.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy nephew is an amazing young man, very talented, happy, confident,<br/>\nsuccessful.
