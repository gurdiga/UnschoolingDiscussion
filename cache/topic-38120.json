I just wanted to thank everybody who have shared","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-820304909\">Hi Everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been in the group for about a month now and I really think you are a <br/>\ngreat bunch of people! I just wanted to thank everybody who have shared their <br/>\nlives with us. It helps so much to read what everybody else is/has gone <br/>\nthrough. I get so many great ideas from all of you! Now for the introduction. <br/>\nMy name is Lori and we live in Michigan. We&#39;ve got two wonderful boys, <br/>\nChristopher (7) & Colt (2). They are the joy of our lives! Christopher <br/>\nactually went to school until the 2nd grade and it was a nightmare. We had <br/>\nsent him to a private kindergarten that my friend was the teacher in. I felt <br/>\nreally better about it because she was there to watch over him. Kindergarten <br/>\nwent great for him. He really enjoyed it and did so well they thought he <br/>\nshould be tested for the GT program ( Gifted & Talented). Of course at the <br/>\ntime I thought this has great. To me GT meant having the time and space to <br/>\nlearn at their own pace and more of an artistic attitude. Boy was I wrong! He <br/>\ngot excepted and then the nightmare began. They had so much paper work to do <br/>\nand sitting quite it was terrible. Of course Christopher was having trouble <br/>\nsitting and doing page after page of problems. How can they except a 5 year <br/>\nold to just sit all day? Anyway, this went on for a while. The teacher was <br/>\nthe worst. Each day I would take Chris to class and help him get ready for <br/>\nthe day by taking him in the classroom and getting him settled. After a while <br/>\nhe started crying about having to stay and it broke my heart. This teacher <br/>\nhad the gall to tell me that I shouldn&#39;t come in and help him settle in <br/>\n(helping him change from boot&#39;s to shoes and hanging the back pack up, things <br/>\nlike that). I should just drop him at the door and if he started to cry to <br/>\njust leave him and SHE&#39;D take care of him! NO WAY! That was the end of that <br/>\nclass! We took him out and they put him and regular 1st grade. Now that half <br/>\nto the year he really enjoyed. The teacher he had was wonderful! He never had <br/>\nany problems with her. She didn&#39;t believe in homework and the kids could sit <br/>\nwhere they wanted. A very relaxed place. But then 2nd grade came along. <br/>\nAnother nightmare teacher. They had just started school and on the SECOND day <br/>\nshe sends home a note and Chris was having trouble sitting in class. We had <br/>\nto sign the slip and take it back in. My husband did it that day and when he <br/>\ntalked to her she said we might have to think about a &quot;behavior program&quot; for <br/>\nhim. When my husband told me that I was furious! This is only the SECOND day <br/>\nof school and she hasn&#39;t even gotten to know Chris yet. He was all excited <br/>\nabout seeing the kids and talking. She couldn&#39;t cut the kids and slack for it <br/>\nbeing the start of school and their being excited about everything. That was <br/>\nthe last straw. I had been reading about homeschooling since he was in the <br/>\n1st grade. It was something I really wanted to do for him. My husband wasn&#39;t <br/>\nconnived at that time but after the 2nd grade teacher he was totally on <br/>\nboard. So long story short(even thought this letter ended up being long) we <br/>\npulled him out and he&#39;s been home ever since and it&#39;s been wonderful. We can <br/>\nsee the joy coming back into his eye&#39;s and he went from having stomachaches <br/>\nand a mouth on him to being our happy little boy again! The first year we did <br/>\nworksheets and such but by this year we went unschooling and it&#39;s been the <br/>\nbest thing we did. Doing a lot of field trip and what ever else he wants to <br/>\ndo. <br/>\nI guess this went on longer then I thought. I can see why other post end up <br/>\nso long. You start typing and before you know it all kinds of stuff flows <br/>\nout. I&#39;ve just really enjoyed all the post and the information this group has <br/>\nto offer. Thanks for sharing!<br/>\n<br/>\nLori from MI<br/>\nP.S. Does anyone know anything about Clonlara School in Ann Arbor?
