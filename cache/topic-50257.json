Your e-list, or at least you <br/>\nare moderator, as I understand it.  The medium is not one for which <br/>\none takes a long time to write, rewrite, rethin, revise, and rewrite <br/>\n20 more times, as I do in all my journalistic and literary work.  <br/>\nThis is a spontaneous mode of communication.

And keep asking until you get the answers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLike, I am still waiting for that clearly spelled out set of <br/>\nparameters that constitute &quot;acceptable&quot; unschooling here.

If I wasn&#39;t so certain of <br/>\nwhat I was doing, hadn&#39;t done 7 years of successful &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>\nalready, wasn&#39;t satisfied with the results, then I would be very <br/>\nintimidated by this kind of vicious questioning about something so <br/>\ntotally nitpicky.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of being a thinking person is to read and listen and then to <br/>\nrealize what we don&#39;t know, what we need to know, and then to ask <br/>\nquestions to fill in some of those knowledge gaps.

In other words, she can&#39;t email unless<br/>\nher spelling is first checked.<br/>\n<br/>\nPosters can expect pretty strong reactions here to issues of controlling<br/>\nchildren&#39;s decisions about themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in general conversation there&#39;s a presumption that we&#39;re good people<br/>\nand if we say something that might sound wrong, that others are to assume<br/>\nthat we&#39;re trying to make a long story short and cutting out all the stuff<br/>\nthat would explain how we were right to do what we did. (And then they talk<br/>\nabout us behind our backs! &quot;Can you believe she said that??&quot; ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of people who don&#39;t make those assumptions here. Discussions<br/>\ngo beyond what we do to *why* we do them. There are no presumptions that<br/>\nthere are good reasons behind apparently nonunschooling, disrespectful of<br/>\nchildren actions. *Everything* gets questioned so that people can understand<br/>\nhow unschooling works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There are a whole lot of questions you didn&#39;t ask here so I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; going to assume anything, but your precise definition<br/>\n&gt; of &quot;unschooling&quot; is...?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not Tuck, but my definition of unschooling includes children making<br/>\ndecision for themselves in a supportive environment. (Taking development<br/>\ninto account. I wouldn&#39;t expect a 2 yo, for instance, to understand my<br/>\nexplanation that being hit by a car could kill them.) That means that I will<br/>\ngive my daughter information but trust her to make decisions for herself. I<br/>\nwill point out that in general adults care more about standard spelling than<br/>\nkids. I will let her know I&#39;ll check spelling. She gets feedback about the<br/>\nusefulness of standard spelling by trying to interpret others nonstandard<br/>\nspelling and any comments or questions about something she&#39;s written. From<br/>\nthat she decides when she wants spelling checked and when to let it go.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And could there have been other<br/>\n&gt; reasons that I wanted to: a) not invade her privacy without her<br/>\n&gt; permission, and b) make sure that she was not corresponding with<br/>\n&gt; anyone who, by my adult perception, might be an adult masquerading as<br/>\n&gt; a child with malevolent intent?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Internet safety, privacy, treatment of other people&#39;s property are all<br/>\nimportant but separate issues from allowing or not allowing emails before<br/>\nspelling is checked.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the midst of a spelling discussion, prefacing a statement with how<br/>\nimportant spelling is to a child&#39;s future, why would a statement about<br/>\nchecking spelling before allowing a child to email be about anything other<br/>\nthan assuring a child gets the importance of standard spelling?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The list&quot; (as though it were a single entity) gets accused of being nit<br/>\npicky. But clarity is important, saying what we mean is important when we&#39;re<br/>\ntrying to help people understand unschooling. It&#39;s not a &quot;let&#39;s all share<br/>\nwhat works for us and let each decide for herself what sounds good to her&quot;<br/>\nkind of list. It&#39;s a &quot;understanding how freedom to live and learn can be put<br/>\ninto practice in real life&quot; kind of list. And that takes being clear about<br/>\nwhy we do what we do and looking at things from many angles to see if we&#39;re<br/>\nseeing things clearly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnything that sounds like &quot;I think this is important and I&#39;m going to<br/>\ncontrol my child until she complies long enough to accept its importance&quot; is<br/>\ngoing to get questioned about whether that&#39;s unschooling or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":48651385,"authorName":"tessimal","from":"&quot;tessimal&quot; &lt;tessimal@...&gt;","profile":"tessimal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: SchoolatHomers/Spelling","postDate":"1037853928","msgId":50342,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFyaG9kOCs5ODFoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk5LjMwMGE1MWEwLjJiMGQ3YzdmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":50341,"nextInTopic":50348,"prevInTime":50341,"nextInTime":50343,"topicId":50257,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

William Caxton brought the printing press to England in <br/>\n1476. Books became cheaper and as a result, literacy became more common. <br/>\nPublishing for the masses became a profitable enterprise, and works in <br/>\nEnglish, as opposed to Latin, became more common. Finally, the printing press <br/>\nbrought standardization to English. The dialect of London, where most <br/>\npublishing houses were located, became the standard. Spelling and grammar <br/>\nbecame fixed, and the first English dictionary was published in 1604. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat dictionary wasn&#39;t extensive, and it wasn&#39;t widely available.  NO books <br/>\nwere widely available to poor people until fairly lately.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wordorigins.org/histeng.htm\">http://www.wordorigins.org/histeng.htm</a><br/>\n(source of above quote)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe printing press quite predates government schools for poor kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=But I also would prefer that folks don&#39;t judge other people <br/>\nbased on those skills alone.  Calling someone names or commenting on <br/>\nintelligence or lack of intelligence based on spelling skills is not <br/>\nnice. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, that&#39;s fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut when an unschooler is criticized for being a slacker and (allegedly) not <br/>\ncaring whether their children learn to write or not, and if the person <br/>\npresenting the criticism can&#39;t spell or write, THEN that can be a profound <br/>\nirritation to the unschooler in question.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw a quote from a local list (not my locale) today, saying those who don&#39;t <br/>\nteach composition are violating state law.  Here&#39;s one quote:  <br/>\n&quot; I am only sugesting knowlege of who one speeks to or what one speeks <br/>\nabout gives weight to consideration. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd last night the superintendent of the Albuquerque Public Schools was on TV <br/>\nsaying he just wanted the kids to &quot;do good in school.&quot;  I don&#39;t think he <br/>\nmeant for them to perform selfless acts.  He meant &quot;do well.&quot;  Does that <br/>\nmatter?  Will it matter when people who respect him for his degrees and <br/>\ncriticize me for &quot;risking my children&#39;s future&quot; can&#39;t tell the difference?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband wasn&#39;t a great speller years ago. He&#39;s gotten better, from <br/>\nwriting.  He used to think that whatever he knew at the end of high school <br/>\nwas what he was stuck with forever.  The fact that his learning continued and <br/>\neven sped up after he was out of school helped him accept unschooling <br/>\nimmediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t razz our kids for misspellings, EVER.  But they have free access to <br/>\nreading and writing opportunities and they ask for help when they want it, <br/>\nand they learn more every single day.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut school has never touched them directly and STILL they want to spell and <br/>\nwrite in such a way that they won&#39;t be seen as kids, or as ignorant.  It&#39;s <br/>\nnot from shame or pressure (unless in small bits, like the time in an online <br/>\ngame when someone told Marty he wrote like a ten year old, and he said &quot;I AM <br/>\na ten year old!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would rather read good ideas with bad spelling than polished and well <br/>\npunctuated nonsense.  But I can understand the frustration of those who must <br/>\nread criticism of unschoolers written by those who are sure structure is the <br/>\nonly right way, but who can&#39;t themselves write standard English.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":48651385,"authorName":"tessimal","from":"&quot;tessimal&quot; &lt;tessimal@...&gt;","profile":"tessimal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: SchoolatHomers/Spelling","postDate":"1037808539","msgId":50291,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFyZ2Mycit1NHE0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGEuMjhiNWJmNGIuMmIwY2ZhYzVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":50285,"nextInTopic":50295,"prevInTime":50290,"nextInTime":50292,"topicId":50257,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And many, <br/>\nincluding the likes of Abraham Lincoln, did not go to school to learn <br/>\nto spell.  Yes, those who have computers usually have spellcheckers, <br/>\nwhich can make spelling conventionally easier, but I often find that <br/>\nthese create as many problems as they solve.  Same with grammar <br/>\ncheckers.  Both of these can change the meaning of what someone is <br/>\ntrying to say if that person doesn&#39;t reference dictionaries and <br/>\nhandbooks to be sure they are using the right word the right way, and <br/>\nthat their grammar and syntax convey the intended meaning.  The goal <br/>\nis to say what you want to say and have it read and interpreted the <br/>\nway you intended it, which is difficult to do under the best of <br/>\ncircumstances, especially in English.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly wouldn&#39;t want to discourage anyone from learning to <br/>\nspell, to use a dictionary, and to understand and apply grammar and <br/>\nsyntax.  But I also would prefer that folks don&#39;t judge other people <br/>\nbased on those skills alone.  Calling someone names or commenting on <br/>\nintelligence or lack of intelligence based on spelling skills is not <br/>\nnice.  Just as our children have many talents, not all of them <br/>\nrecognized by government or formalized education, so too do many <br/>\npeople have wonderful knowledge to share with us, even if they don&#39;t <br/>\nalways follow recognized spelling and grammar conventions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the IM &quot;languages&quot; that many teens use is wonderful, <br/>\nvery creative, and wouldn&#39;t want to discourage them from continuing <br/>\nto create new ways to communicate using this medium.  But <br/>\nconventional spelling still has its place.  I am not trying to <br/>\nconvince folks to abandon the conventions, just be more open to all <br/>\nkinds of intelligence and not to be so quick to judge intelligence <br/>\nbased on spelling.  Many the great &quot;intelligent&quot; man, perhaps a <br/>\nleader in his time, was supported on the page by a good secretary or <br/>\nan editor who made the great man and his writing look good by <br/>\ncorrecting all the conventions. <br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: SchoolatHomers/Spelling","postDate":"1037803717","msgId":50285,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEuMjhiNWJmNGIuMmIwY2ZhYzVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":50273,"nextInTopic":50291,"prevInTime":50284,"nextInTime":50286,"topicId":50257,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/20/02 6:33:00 AM, tessimal@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-487492900\">In a message dated 11/20/02 6:33:00 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tessimal@...\">tessimal@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I also remember one extraordinary lecturer in an Ed Psych class in <br/>\ncollege who stood up on the table in the middle of the kiva as he <br/>\ntold us about his life. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou must have gone to the University of New Mexico. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Ah, spelling, one of our favorite &quot;conventions,&quot; and a big piece of <br/>\nclass discrimination in this country, all instituted by the master <br/>\ninstitution of power and control......SCHOOL! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool didn&#39;t invent spelling.

When the founding <br/>\nfathers, many of whom owned slaves, were writing our hallowed <br/>\nDeclaration of Independence and Constitution, spelling in this <br/>\ncountry was quite happenstance.  If what one wrote was generally <br/>\nunderstood by others then no one worried much about the spelling.  <br/>\nBut as &quot;schooling&quot; came into favor, specifically as the wealthy <br/>\ncreated and supported their elitist schools, we began to see class <br/>\ndistinctions made regarding those who spelled one way and those who <br/>\nspelled any other way; the King&#39;s or Queen&#39;s English, versus that of <br/>\nthe common man.  And thus the convention of spelling began to take on <br/>\nits role as one of many class distinguishers, separators, of those <br/>\nwho were elite, better schooled, than the rest of the lower class <br/>\ncitizens of this country.  If anyone ever does any geneaological <br/>\nresearch and reads early documents and records one quickly discovers <br/>\nthat even our cherished family names were spelled many different ways <br/>\nnot all that long ago in history.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I used to teach English and French, so I do <br/>\nunderstand the importance of this convention for my child&#39;s future. <br/>\nThus I allowed her to IM and email and ICQ her friends starting at a <br/>\nvery young age, as long as she let me check her spelling when she did <br/>\nthis.  She quickly learned how to do this herself and has become <br/>\nquite a good speller.  And she is now as fast to jump in, commenting <br/>\nabout someone&#39;s lack of intelligence based on their spelling, as <br/>\nanyone else these days, much to my chagrin.  I have to remind her <br/>\nthat it isn&#39;t an intelligence factor, just a convention, though one <br/>\nthat is pretty important to lots of people, usually people who <br/>\ncontrol many powerful positions in our lives.  And grammar and <br/>\npunctuation serve the same purpose in our bag of &quot;conventions.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also worked with students and adults, including my husband, who <br/>\nwere born with hard-wiring glitches, like hubby&#39;s dyslexia, that <br/>\nprevented him from reading and spelling well, and from doing some <br/>\npretty basic math, too.  He found it so frustrating as a child, when <br/>\nno one had diagnosed his problem and no one offered any special help, <br/>\nthat he simply chose to not learn spelling, thus not to communicate <br/>\nin writing any more than he had to, and not to do math, and he could <br/>\nnot really read well until he was 21.  He grew up and remains someone <br/>\nwho thinks of himself as stupid because of these early learning <br/>\nfailures; a very self-limiting way to grow up, in my opinion.  And <br/>\nafter struggling for many years on his own he finally figured out a <br/>\nway to make words work in his brain at age 21, and has been reading <br/>\never since.  But he chose to not catch up on spelling and math.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is not stupid or ignorant.  And I suspect that there are many like <br/>\nhim in his generation and those older than him, older than me.  And <br/>\nprobably quite a few undiagnosed in the younger generations, too.  <br/>\nBut after being treated as a stupid though well-behaved, well-<br/>\nmannered, quiet black boy all the way through school and life he has <br/>\npaid a big price in utter and total lack of self-esteem, a price <br/>\nexacted by all who pointed fingers at his failing the test of <br/>\nour &quot;conventions&quot; and &quot;constructs.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI knew better immediatedly when I talked with him and recognized that <br/>\nhis verbal language skills and patterns were outstanding.  He had <br/>\ngood contextual and advanced vocabulary, excellent sentence <br/>\nstructure, but he could not write, could not spell, nor could he do <br/>\nsome pretty basic math, at all.  Yes, this has severely limited some <br/>\nof his life choices.  But I still appreciate what is wonderful about <br/>\nhim.  Just as I am sure all of us hope that someone will appreciate <br/>\nwhat is special about all our children as they grow into their <br/>\nindependent lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, I guess we all have to ask what is really important.  Is it <br/>\nwhat others think of us?  That we live our lives so that others think <br/>\nhighly of us?  So that we conform to all the current conventions?  Or <br/>\nthat we are true to ourselves?  And without self-esteem how can our <br/>\nchildren ever find their own way?  I truly believe that was the <br/>\nprimary poison that has tainted the biggest portion of his life and <br/>\nhis life choices.  Understandable, but sad nonetheless; and also not <br/>\nmy job to fix!  But that doesn&#39;t get in the way of my love for him.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t need a good speller on my arm to feel good about myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also remember one extraordinary lecturer in an Ed Psych class in <br/>\ncollege who stood up on the table in the middle of the kiva as he <br/>\ntold us about his life.  He had struggled with reading and writing <br/>\nand math all his life, was flunking out of school when the Korean <br/>\nconflict came along and he managed to slip in under the wire and <br/>\nenlisted.  To do so he had to study the test for several weeks and <br/>\nmemorize what he had to write to answer the questions correctly.  He <br/>\nserved and survived and took his G.I. Bill money to go to college, <br/>\ngetting himself in by the skin of his teeth.  He said he got through <br/>\none course at a time by going to the library and sitting there and <br/>\nliterally memorizing the books he had to read, copying every chapter, <br/>\nevery page, until he had memorized the information.  And he ended up <br/>\nwith a Ph. D. in Educational Psychology.  He was by far one of the <br/>\nbest lecturers I had in college, and one I will never forget.  So, <br/>\nagain, conventions do not determine intelligence, but may restrict <br/>\njob opportunities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that as self-directed educators, unschooling moms and dads, <br/>\nthat we will not burden our children with too much condemning baggage <br/>\nabout who is and who isn&#39;t intelligent based on these kinds of <br/>\nconventions.  Conforming to spelling conventions is very helpful in <br/>\nour modern information intense world, but does not indicate who has <br/>\nthe most brain power.  Plenty of people around the world, from many <br/>\ndifferent countries and cultures, who have never had the luxury of <br/>\nall the educational options our children enjoy are very intelligent <br/>\npeople, despite their lack of educated conventions. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know your comments were not meant to be so serious, but it is a <br/>\nsubject very near and dear to me, so I just wanted to reply, hoping <br/>\nthat the glasses through which we view others, here and around the <br/>\nglobe, are not clouded by our own elitist conventions.
