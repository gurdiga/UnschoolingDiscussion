Kids get that message from the media<br/>\nALL the time in subtle and not so subtle ways.  My two girls have said<br/>\nsimilar things in the past when I was clearly overweight.  I said well what<br/>\nabout me?  And they&#39;d tell me I wasn&#39;t fat.  :0)  Over the last year I&#39;ve<br/>\nreally focused on getting fit and eating right.  I&#39;ve lost most of the<br/>\nexcess weight I carried and I now exercise every day.  If they just said<br/>\nthat recently, and not when I was fatter, I might have wondered if they got<br/>\nthat message from me in some way, but I know that isn&#39;t true and it made it<br/>\neasier to see that because I was overweight at the time of the comments.<br/>\nIt makes me sad that society focuses so much on what people look like.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen watching some extreme makeovers on TV recently and I find them<br/>\nfascinating but I find it really sad that people feel the need to alter<br/>\ntheir bodies so much through such drastic measures.  I am not talking about<br/>\nlife saving operations here.  Sometimes the people already seem beautiful to<br/>\nme.  Not perfect, but beautiful, but it never seems to be enough for some<br/>\npeople.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAngela <br/>\n &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a>&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> <br/>\n <br/>\nRheta wrote:<br/>\n Yet recently my daughter started<br/>\nsaying that fat people were not allowed in her club.

We have strived really hard to bring<br/>\nup our children to accept all human beings according to their actions,<br/>\nnot the way they look on the outside.  Yet recently my daughter started<br/>\nsaying that fat people were not allowed in her club.  She doesn&#39;t have a<br/>\nclub but that is the phrase she used.  I asked her why and she said<br/>\nbeing fat wasn&#39;t good.  I talked to her about how different we all are<br/>\nbut I can&#39;t figure out where she got the idea that fat people were<br/>\nunacceptable.  I even explained that there are a lot of people thinner<br/>\nthan me and some thin people would call me fat but to her that is just<br/>\nnot going to happen (it&#39;s nice to be loved :-)) but still can&#39;t figure<br/>\nout where the notion came from.  I could blame it on something she heard<br/>\nbut I can&#39;t be sure that it isn&#39;t something she decided herself.  We&#39;ve<br/>\nalways tried to answer questions straightforward and when she notices<br/>\ndifferences we discuss it.  It just kind of came out of the blue<br/>\nrecently and shocked me.  I guess I didn&#39;t expect it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOne funny thing when Isabel was 3 though, she saw a little boy with an<br/>\neye patch and she whispered loudly, &quot;Mom!  I just saw a pirate!!&quot;  The<br/>\nlittle boy turned around and he seemed to think it was cool that she<br/>\nthought he was a pirate.
