Here is how it goes.<br/>\n1) someone starts posting very strong, argumentative statements and opinions.<br/>\n2) the list divides into groups, and the he said, she said crap starts.<br/>\n3) eventually someone, or a few someones say Enough!<br/>\n4) a few people start crying foul, and eventually someone takes aim at one <br/>\nparticular person.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first joined there was one person like this, she had an argument for <br/>\nevery topic, an opinion about every person. She never wanted to listen, and <br/>\nanytime anyone ever suggested something she didn&#39;t want to hear she blamed it <br/>\nall on Sandra. Now, I am not going to defend Sandra, she can do that herself, <br/>\nbut it amazes me to no end when someone tries this *Its all HER&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fault!* <br/>\nargument when things, topics, get out of control like this. <br/>\nWhile I enjoy the off topic debate as much as the next guy, what I come here <br/>\nfor is the information. Some have said they are leaving because they aren&#39;t <br/>\ngetting the information about unschooling they thought they were going to get <br/>\nhere. I wish they would stick around and see that (almost) all we discuss is <br/>\ngood information. Others get huffy when someone who has been unschooling <br/>\ntheir children years, says *thats not unschooling.* While there are no hard, <br/>\nfast rules for unschooling, there are some things that just aren&#39;t <br/>\nunschooling, and we have or will find out what those things are. The problem <br/>\nwith this is that some have been to other lists, I know I have, where there <br/>\nis lots of blanket statements made about unschooling. Lots of huggy, <br/>\npat-on-the-back posts. It seems that some (usually people who haven&#39;t done it <br/>\nfor long, or have read something out of context or generalized something to <br/>\nthe point of blandness) feel that unschooling is doing whatever works for <br/>\nthem. This includes unschooling everything but math, doing subjects in the <br/>\nmorning and unschooling in the afternoon, or what I call *Sunday <br/>\nUnschoolers.* People who only unschool when it suits them. If you are doing <br/>\nany of those things, that is not unschooling. <br/>\nWhile Ned may very well be right about what problems exist in the public <br/>\neducation area, some of the information comes across as over sensationalized. <br/>\nI have found that as the years go by, I think less and less on terms of <br/>\n*school* If, suddenly homeschooling became illegal, I would do it anyway. I <br/>\nthink many here would as well. I don&#39;t even see us as homeschoolers much <br/>\nanymore. (In the sense that homeschool is an adjective for what we do, <br/>\nbecause it isn&#39;t what *we* do.) <br/>\nSo, if you came here to learn from those who have gone before you then by all <br/>\nmeans, pull up a chair! But please, don&#39;t point fingers because the comfort <br/>\nlevel of what is being offered is beyond what you can take. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"List insults","postDate":"1028922521","msgId":40464,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5Nzk5NEQ5LkI1NzIlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDhmLjIwNGMzMzY3LjJhODUxODUzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40411,"nextInTopic":40533,"prevInTime":40463,"nextInTime":40465,"topicId":40274,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Since everyone was required<br/>\nto pay for it, it became more and more accepted, but not without resistance.<br/>\nThe catholics didn&#39;t like the secular nature of the schools, and wanted<br/>\nschools that taught their children according to their beliefs. The schism<br/>\ncaused the Catholic Riots in Philadelphia, and led to that church setting up<br/>\nits own private school system.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, the state-run schools are controlled from Washington. Local control<br/>\nis now a myth kept alive by lying politicians.  &quot;The Blob&quot; (the name for the<br/>\ninterlocking education bureaucracy) is still trying to create a homogeneous,<br/>\npredictable, obedient mass of workers/spenders/taxpayers who will support<br/>\nthe millions of unproductive activities that are promoted in the schools and<br/>\nelsewhere.   Heck, we can&#39;t have actual educated people when there&#39;s so<br/>\nlittle for them to do -- they&#39;ll go crazy. We need simple-minded people by<br/>\nthe millions who don&#39;t know what they&#39;re missing and who feel too dumb even<br/>\nto teach their kids any more than elementary skills. (That was, in so many<br/>\nwords, announced by the first US commissioner of education at the turn of<br/>\nthe 20th century. See JT Gatto&#39;s, &quot;The Guerilla Curriculum)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe states have joined with the teacher unions to produce an almost seamless<br/>\nbureaucratic web that controls not just the children, but their families and<br/>\ncommunities. The schools have also become centers for medical &quot;services&quot; and<br/>\npsychological intrusions into the personal lives of all citizens. The<br/>\nPrussian dream of total control is becoming a reality in America,<br/>\ncompliments of your local &quot;public&quot; school. And we even pay for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40525,"nextTopicId":40553}}
