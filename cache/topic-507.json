Here goes:<br/>\nI&#39;m Angela, mom to Abby-5; Mitchell-3; Noah-6months (wife to <br/>\nGary).  We live in Tampa, FL.  I&#39;ve been interested in hs&#39;ing for <br/>\nabout 3 years...started out thinking that we&#39;d have cute little desks <br/>\nand bulletin boards.  Wow!  Have my ideas evolved...I really like <br/>\nunschooling and Charlotte Mason, too.  Sometimes, though, it <br/>\nfeels like I&#39;m flying by the seat of my pants and I have to re-focus.  <br/>\nI&#39;m wondering about what to do with Abby, as far as reading <br/>\ngoes...she seems like she wants to read, but she hates it when I <br/>\ntry to instruct her.  She gets upset and starts drifting.  But, on her <br/>\nown, she&#39;ll write down letters and ask me what they say.  Her <br/>\nfavorite thing to write is &quot;I love u&quot;.  Any suggestions?<br/>\nWhat type of doctor is your sis?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; By the way, any of you Floridians live near Tampa?  I have a sister there<br/>\n&gt; who is a doctor. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Angela Nordstrom<br/>\nMaya Wrap baby carriers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wrapyourbaby@...\">wrapyourbaby@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":496,"nextTopicId":488}}
