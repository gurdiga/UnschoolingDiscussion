Then I saw it when it came out with <br/>\nLawrence Fishburn and Kenneth Branagh.  I haven&#39;t watched the other two Othello <br/>\nmovies.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... I had read it once in the 70&#39;s, seen a movie in the early 80&#39;s, and <br/>\nthat was all. Seems like a lot.  (Plus all my familiarity with other Shakespeare <br/>\nplays, and being raised reading the King James Bible, and the cherry on the <br/>\ntop of &quot;I have an English degree.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I asked Marty if he wanted to watch it with me since it has Lawrence <br/>\nFishburn.  Marty and I have been Lawrence Fishburn fans since he was Cowboy Curtis <br/>\non PeeWee&#39;s Playhouse, and we rooted for him in Searching for Bobby Fisher, <br/>\nand so Marty said &quot;Sure.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI warned him it wasn&#39;t a happy play.  Definitely a trajedy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell.  Marty understood what was going on perfectly well.  He learned the <br/>\ncharacters&#39; names as it went.  He was having NO trouble.  A couple of times when <br/>\nit seemed least like English I&#39;d look at him or ask him if he got that, and he <br/>\nhad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe made comments that were as good as anybody would have made.  He talked <br/>\nabout Iago being the main character, and I thought about saying &quot;antagonist&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;protagonist,&quot; but decided not to.  We watched half and quit til the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked to Keith about it.  He said &quot;Well, it&#39;s because they&#39;ve been exposed <br/>\nto Shakespeare their whole lives, and nobody&#39;s told them it&#39;s supposed to be <br/>\nhard.&quot;  I told him I hadn&#39;t said &quot;antagonist,&quot; but maybe I should the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I HAD said (I told him) was &quot;But if they called it &#39;Iago the Shit,&#39; it <br/>\nwould have given away the story.&quot;   He said it might be because they want to <br/>\nfocus on good guys instead of glorifying evil.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the next day we made an especially good lunch and sat down with it to <br/>\nwatch the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!  The night before, after we had quit, I put on the Reduced Shakespeare <br/>\nCompany, right to the Othello part, and showed Marty up to the part in the movie <br/>\nwe&#39;d seen.  It was funny, but I turned it off before they would give away <br/>\nwhat Marty didn&#39;t know.  He had been about to go up and play video games, but <br/>\nsaid he would stay to see that.  It was two minutes or less.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he said &quot;Do they do ALL the plays?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Not really.  They do all the histories as a football match, and they combine <br/>\nthe comedies into one big story.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Do they do Hamlet?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I want to see it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHamlet&#39;s the longest one, but he said yeah, he&#39;s rather see that and then go <br/>\nplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time Hamlet was over, Kirby was back and took over his own video game, <br/>\nbut Marty didn&#39;t really mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was a pretty great Shakespeare &quot;happening.&quot;   It was more fun for me to <br/>\nsee it with Marty than alone.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter we watched the second half, Marty watched quite a bit more of the <br/>\ncomedy disc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were both rented and have been sent back, but I recommend if anyone has <br/>\nNetflix getting that &quot;Complete Works of Shakespeare&quot; by the Reduced <br/>\nShakespeare Company.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw them perform in Albuquerque the year before they went permanent in <br/>\nEngland, but as explained on this DVD, they have three companies, one in London <br/>\nand two touring.  The commentary track is interesting, and there&#39;s a video (one <br/>\ncamera home video) of one of their shows many years ago at a Renaissance fair <br/>\nin California, where they used to do Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet separately <br/>\nand then pass the hat.  One of the guys has been doing this for twenty years <br/>\nnow.  A Renaissance Fair skit became a lifelong career.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere in there I had a momentary flash of Marty becoming a Shakespeare <br/>\nscholar or professor or actor.  WEIRD.  Marty is NOT the kind of guy I would <br/>\nthink would want to go academic, but DAMN he understood that effortlessly, and <br/>\ndiscussed it intelligently.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t hurt that the acting was good and the enunciation was clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78400,"nextTopicId":78770}}
