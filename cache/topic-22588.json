He scored in the top 3% in <br/>\nthe nation. (you knew I was going to say that right. No one ever emails if <br/>\ntheir kid is in the bottom 3%!) Top 1% in math. My friend says, as he often <br/>\ndoes, that his child is a lot smarter than him and he is only in 2nd grade. <br/>\nThat is so stupid.

And they tie it together, in most <br/>\nrepetitive ways, from year to year, but rarely do they cross-reference <br/>\n(science to language, history to music, math to history, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers, meanwhile come on dots randomly and connect them to other random <br/>\ndots, and our kids end up with a huge web of connections.  Holes?  Surely, <br/>\nbut if you got a  hundred of the best-educated mainstream kids and compared <br/>\nwhat they know, ALL would have a hole or ten compared to what the others <br/>\nhappened to have learned.  And it is impossible to separate what a bright kid <br/>\nlearned in school from what he came across and connected on his own after (or <br/>\nduring) school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not measurable, regardless of the joy some take in &quot;standardized <br/>\ntests.&quot;   All you can measure is how well a person does on that test--not how <br/>\nmuch more he knows, now how psychic he is, or how his deductive powers work <br/>\n(eliminate the two worst, make a best guess--the whole column won&#39;t be &quot;B&quot; so <br/>\nfollowing five &quot;B&quot; answers, go with the other if you can&#39;t decide...).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the grid of all possibilities is the model, the schools stay in the corner <br/>\nof school-requirements, what will be on the SAT test.  Our kids are out <br/>\nriding horses or collecting action figures or cooking or building tents or <br/>\nteaching embroidery, without regard for the test.

It has probably been <br/>\npresented before in this fashion or something similiar, and I am sure I have <br/>\nheard it, but sometimes things just grab you as this did.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone had brought up how they sometimes are in the company of other <br/>\nhomeschoolers who do &quot;school at home&quot; and they will ask her . . .&quot;you mean, <br/>\nyou aren&#39;t doing fractions yet?&quot; or some other similiar innane comment. And <br/>\nshe never really knows what to say and always feels sort of odd about it. <br/>\nAnother person there gave a great explanation that goes like this. . . she <br/>\ntook out a large sheet of blank paper, and said this blank area of the paper <br/>\nrepresents all of the knowledge or material out there available to learn <br/>\nabout, and if we are being realistic, this paper would only be a small <br/>\nportion of it. Then she put a dot on the paper and said, this dot represents <br/>\nwhat schools(or some other curriculumn) have deemed important to learn. And <br/>\nthen she said we, as unschoolers, just have decided that we will learn a <br/>\ndifferent dot. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just so love this. . . because the young people in my family get to choose <br/>\nwhich dot they are interested in learning about. And they can change that dot <br/>\nat anytime they choose as well. And I can choose my own dot. So here&#39;s to <br/>\nchoosing our own dots!! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\nIf you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself, and then <br/>\nmake a change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22473,"nextTopicId":22605}}
