I hope some of you who are more <br/>\nexperienced can address this. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I saw with my kids is that their &quot;schooled&quot; peers *intimidate* them. <br/>\nWhen schooled kids discuss their grades, projects, tests and &quot;hard&quot; classes, my kids <br/>\nimmediately see themselves as not capable of that kind of work (or at least show some <br/>\nconcern that they might not be). <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter went to school part time partly (I think) to test the theory - to see if she could <br/>\nkeep up with her peers in a school setting. Turned out she did great! But I still hear her <br/>\nsaying that &quot;so-and-so&quot; is &quot;really smart&quot; because she&#39;s getting all As in her honors classes. <br/>\nGrrrr.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is convinced he can&#39;t &quot;cut it&quot; but he also cares about that a lot less than his sister.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I don&#39;t like is when I hear the schooled kids repeat the propaganda - &quot;You mean you <br/>\nhaven&#39;t studied ___________ in homeschool?

My dh, mom and dad talk about our last 12 months <br/>\npretty much weekly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did want to add an offshoot to Sandra&#39;s comment about school kids <br/>\ndeciding something was &#39;stupid&#39;, even if the subject was near to <br/>\nheart for another kid and being made to feel little for loving the <br/>\nsubject (paraphrased of course).  A few weeks ago, my 11yo dd was <br/>\nconsidering going to summer school with her school buddies just to <br/>\nbasically hang out and be with them.  Then one mentioned that my dd <br/>\nwould have to take reading and math along with the fun classes, and <br/>\nmath in middle school was HARD.  When she shared this conversation <br/>\nwith me I could honestly see the angst on this kids face.  It made me <br/>\ncry inside, you see, because her dad and I were both math teachers, <br/>\nhim in hs and I in ms.  I told her that the middle school math in <br/>\nsummer school was really not that hard.  She said that I would say <br/>\nthat because I had taught it.  I told her fair enough, but let me <br/>\ntell you about the math I taught in middle school last summer (a <br/>\nmonth before they fired me).  The kids were given a materials list <br/>\n(toothpicks, 10 cents apiece and clay, some amount per square inch) <br/>\nand were instructed to build a building yea high.  They were also <br/>\ngiven a budget to come in under.  They only had two days to do this, <br/>\nalthough many really got into it and would really have benefitted <br/>\nfrom more TIME to make mistakes and explore, we had to move on <br/>\n(different thread).  I then asked my dd if this didn&#39;t sound like <br/>\nmuch of what she did this whole year on her own.  She said yes, but <br/>\nshe thought there would be multiplication tables involved and I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t TEACH that to her this year (she looked ready to cry this <br/>\ntime).  I told her that that wasn&#39;t something she communicated to me <br/>\nshe wanted to LEARN.  Then I listed the &#39;mathy&#39; things she did do, <br/>\nZoombinis (for unlimited hours and is better at it than me!), <br/>\nBackyard baseball (studying statistics to build strong teams), Math <br/>\nShop (obvious), building her treehouse, planning and having yard <br/>\nsales to buy stereo equipment, cooking with me, helping me plan and <br/>\nbuy for the family meals, sewing 9 block quilts and arranging the <br/>\nsquares so they are visually appealing and so on.  I then told her <br/>\nthat the math she DID do this year may not have been with paper and <br/>\npencil like her peers, but it WAS math that she would never forget, <br/>\nenjoyed, wasn&#39;t afraid of and that put her ahead of her peers, maybe <br/>\nnot now, but down the road when they&#39;re still afraid of math, she <br/>\nwon&#39;t have any problems.  I also told her if she wanted to practice <br/>\nher multiplication tables, I would do that with her too.  So far she <br/>\nhasn&#39;t.
