Tolan. <br/>\nAuthor : \tTolan, Stephanie S. <br/>\nWhen Jake Semple is kicked out of yet another school, the Applewhites, an <br/>\neccentric family of artists, offer to let him live with them and attend their <br/>\nunstructured Creative Academy. Twelve-year-old E.D., the only non-artistic <br/>\n(and organized) person in her family, feels like &quot;the invisible Applewhite&quot; and <br/>\nis wary of Jake. Through Jake and E.D&#39;s alternating perspectives, Tolan (The <br/>\nFace in the Mirror) introduces the outrageous titular clan. E.D.&#39;s pompous <br/>\nfather directs a local production of The Sound of Music, while her mother <br/>\nbreaks from her popular mysteries to write the Great American Novel; her <br/>\nuncle carves a coffee table that her poet aunt defends to Jake, &quot;Well, you <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t put a cup of coffee on it, of course, but then who would want to? It&#39;s <br/>\nwonderfully soul-filling, don&#39;t you think?&quot; Some of the plotting feels unfinished: <br/>\nE.D. and Jake don&#39;t formally make peace and the Applewhites never come to <br/>\nterms with their individual narcissism. Jake&#39;s transformation too seems <br/>\nunconvincing. But humor abounds in the ever-building chaos: a writer coming <br/>\nto interview E.D.&#39;s mother stays to do a slew of projects on the famous family, <br/>\nincluding inviting a television crew to document their lives. In the end, it&#39;s the <br/>\nantics of the cast of characters that keep this show on the road.

Joey, the <br/>\nsweetest, funniest kid on meds you&#39;ll ever meet, has enough trouble trying to <br/>\nkeep his &quot;active&quot; self together. How can he win in his new, self-assumed role <br/>\nas &quot;Mr. Helpful&quot; when his divorced parents are out of control, his Grandma is <br/>\nsurly and morbid, and Olivia, the mean blind girl he&#39;s forced to homeschool <br/>\nwith, calls him a &quot;hyper retard&quot;? Even Olivia&#39;s religious mother can&#39;t save him <br/>\nwith her &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot; refrain. As his world of flawed adults spins <br/>\naround him in carnivalesque chaos, Joey has to decide on a daily basis what <br/>\nhe, Joey, should do. At least he has Pablo, his loyal Chihuahua mutt, his lucky <br/>\ncharm. Or at least he does until his maniacal father (complete with restraining <br/>\norder) kidnaps the dog to lure Joey out of the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoey is a wonderful character, and his first-person narrative is both hilarious <br/>\nand heartbreaking. Sadly, it is his dying grandmother who knows him best: <br/>\n&quot;You know, Joey, if you didn&#39;t wear those med patches, you&#39;d just be thinking <br/>\nabout yourself, and you wouldn&#39;t care about making everyone happy. Your <br/>\nproblem is that you got better, and the rest of the world didn&#39;t.&quot; While it is more <br/>\nrewarding to have read the previous Joey books before this one, it is not <br/>\nmandatory. Still, all three Joey books are memorable, honest, fresh, exciting, <br/>\ntruly eye-opening, and should not be missed by child or adult.

Carey Reid. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Publishers Weekly<br/>\nA father&#39;s love for his dying daughter illuminates this heartrending first novel. <br/>\nJim Kaldy, who narrates in a careful, steady voice, tells us at the beginning <br/>\nthat his family&#39;s story is not an easy one. Kim and his wife Marsha&#39;s only child, <br/>\nsix-year-old Stella, suffers from a lethal, painful, congenital skin disease that <br/>\nhas has left her hideously deformed. Jim quits his job as a government <br/>\nfinancial analyst to care for Stella, allowing Marsha to resume her career. <br/>\nForced to confront the pain and humiliation his child endures on a daily basis, <br/>\nJim takes Stella out of school to teach her at home. Yet just as Stella begins to <br/>\nblossom under his care, they are faced with a difficult decision about a skin-<br/>\ngraft operation that could alleviate the effects of Stella&#39;s disability but would <br/>\nsubject her to risky side effects. Without sentimentality or melodrama, Reid <br/>\ncreates a harrowing yet immensely moving story. The Kaldys&#39; dilemma is <br/>\nmade palpably real, along with their quiet heroism in bearing the terrible <br/>\nburden, and their mutual love. Drawn in by Reid&#39;s unflinching, often lyrical <br/>\nprose, the reader gets through it too, and emerges humbled by this story of <br/>\nordinary people with extraordinary hearts. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlice, I think  \t<br/>\nby Susan Juby <br/>\nEver since Alice arrived at first grade dressed as a hobbit and endured a <br/>\nweek of increasingly violent peer rejection, she has been home schooled by <br/>\nher hippie mom and indifferent dad, leaving her with what her therapist calls <br/>\n&quot;a shocking poverty of age-appropriate real-life experience.&quot; Now Alice&#39;s <br/>\ninept new therapist, Death Lord Bob, has cornered her into agreeing to go to <br/>\nthe public high school. Actually, this fits right in with Alice&#39;s career aspirations <br/>\nto become a cultural critic, and her eighties style statement would be working <br/>\nout pretty much all right (especially after she gets a great haircut somewhat by <br/>\naccident) if it weren&#39;t for her old nemesis Linda, now grown seriously <br/>\nhomicidal, and her two head banger henchmen. Alice&#39;s sensible observations <br/>\nare a rich source of humor in this very funny first novel, as she tries to get her <br/>\nlife together in spite of the peculiar aberrations of the &quot;normal&quot; teen and adult <br/>\npopulation of Smithers, a small ingrown town in British Columbia where <br/>\nentertainment opportunities are limited to excuse-to-drink events like the <br/>\nNorthern Saddle Sores&#39; Family Trail Ride. Her mother is the kind of tie-dye <br/>\nclad woman who holds a sage-burning ceremony for safety before starting out <br/>\non a back-to-school shopping trip, and her friends include bookstore owner <br/>\nCorinne, who is allergic to books. Her romance-writing father&#39;s poker cronies <br/>\nare equally colorful: gay but style-challenged Finn and taxi-owning Marcus, <br/>\nwho has a succession of twenty-years-younger girlfriends who need a ride. <br/>\nWhen Alice&#39;s sullen girl cousin Frank arrives, a parents&#39; nightmare with her <br/>\nbizarre outfits and stuffed-animal backpack filled with bottles and baggies, <br/>\nAlice observes the resulting hullabaloo with amused satisfaction, and after a <br/>\nhilarious, precarious car trip to a Fish Show and Drum Workshop, she finds <br/>\nherself well on the way to acquiring a friend and a boyfriend. Older teens will <br/>\nenjoy the story and the many descriptions of wacky clothes if they can get past <br/>\nthe misguided cover, a picture of five-year-old Alice&#39;s chubby hobbit-clad legs. <br/>\n(Ages 12 and older) --Patty Campbell--This text refers to the Hardcover <br/>\nedition.<br/>\n290 p. ; 19 cm.Notes: <br/>\nPreviously published in Canada : Thistledown Press, 2000. </div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105450,"nextTopicId":105402}}
