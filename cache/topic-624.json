NO one would<br/>\npromise me a job until I actually moved. They&#39;d been burned by too many<br/>\npeople who after being promised the job didn&#39;t actually move. While I can&#39;t<br/>\nhelp you with a job, I can tell you that I live in a very safe area, my<br/>\nchildren can stay outside riding their bikes in the private road here until<br/>\nlate and we can leave our doors unlocked at all times (but I feel safer if<br/>\nthey are locked while we sleep). We live in a mobile home park and if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t mind that there are a couple of homes for sale here that are pretty<br/>\nnice for about $4000 (two bedrooms). This is a college town (1.5 miles<br/>\naway) so there are lots of jobs, nothing terrific right away, but enough to<br/>\neasily pay the bills until finding something just right. Population of the<br/>\ntown itself is about 7000, but this is farming country so we are really in<br/>\nthe country, (my children grew up watching ducks cross the streets and cars<br/>\nstopping for them!!)
