When Matt was very little and I was still mega-monitoring <br/>\nfood (making sure each child got a certain amount of foods from each <br/>\nfood group each day), I MADE him (shudder) eat a piece of cantalope.  <br/>\nHe told me he didn&#39;t want it.  He told me cantalopes make his throat <br/>\nhurt.  I told him that was silly, thinking he was just making an <br/>\nexcuse.  I forced him to eat it, and his lips swelled and he had <br/>\ntrouble breathing.  It was a near anaphylactic reaction, I almost <br/>\ncalled 911. :(  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had NO idea that he was allergic to cantaloupe, but he knew that it <br/>\nmade his body feel icky when he ate it, and didn&#39;t want it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, kids definitely recognize when something isn&#39;t good for <br/>\nthem!  Kids who are allowed to learn to listen to their bodies and <br/>\ntrust their instincts about what to eat or not eat are very luck <br/>\nkids! <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":149070321,"authorName":"Unschoolmom7@aol.com","from":"Unschoolmom7@...","profile":"bkjbcts","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Food","postDate":"1086442660","msgId":95205,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMC4yZmU4OTAzNy4yZGYzMjZhNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":95237,"prevInTime":95204,"nextInTime":95206,"topicId":95205,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I thought I d throw in my two cents on this issue.

I don&#39;t post often, but I <br/>\nfind it very interesting that some people do not think children as young as 3, <br/>\n4, 5 are able to choose what they want to eat. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter was born in 2001. When she was a couple of months old she started <br/>\nthrowing up. This happened once a month pretty regularly, until she was about <br/>\n18 mos (she would throw up and fall right to sleep). At about 18mos she <br/>\nstarted becoming dizzy and disoriented, also. We took her to a couple of <br/>\nspecialists and the consensus was she was having migraines. Now our job was to find out <br/>\nwhat was causing them. She had a major episode in Sept. of that year and then <br/>\nnothing until Feb (that would be her last). By Nov. I had noticed she had quit <br/>\neating Fresh tomatoes. That was what was causing her episodes. They had <br/>\npeaked in the summer because she was picking them off the vine in the garden.<br/>\nShe was not quite 2 when she figured this out for herself. She still doesn&#39;t <br/>\neat tomatoes and she has not had an episode in over a year.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to think that children cannot determine what is or is not good for them is <br/>\nin my opinion, absurd, especially since we have first hand knowledge that <br/>\nthey are quite capable.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99835,"nextTopicId":99889}}
