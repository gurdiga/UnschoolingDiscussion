We have kept him at it because he enjoys playing but can <br/>\nbe easily frustrated with a new piece.  He has a natural talent that <br/>\nI enjoy (proud mama that I am) but I don&#39;t want him to hate it.  His <br/>\nDad and I talked with him about his lessons and he is deciding if he <br/>\nwants to continue. We explained our reasons (some admittedly selfish) <br/>\nand stressed our love.  However it works out, we are proud of his <br/>\naccomplishments (which can never be taken away) and support his <br/>\nchoice.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep up the &quot;pressure&quot; gang!  We are getting there!!<br/>\nBeth Anne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50066,"nextTopicId":50025}}
