The Live and Learn Unschooling Conference location for 2005  <br/>\nhas been changed to St. Louis, Missouri.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s very centrally located, and St. Louis is a gorgeous city with lots to  <br/>\ndo and see. I hope many of you will make a vacation out of this and spend some  <br/>\nextra time in the Midwest. <br/>\n <br/>\nSt. Louis is five hours from Chicago, Kansas City, Nashville, and  <br/>\nMemphis----LOTS to see! St. Louis itself is home to the Cardinals, Budweiser  Brewery, <br/>\nThe Bowling Hall of Fame, Grant&#39;s Farm, a lovely free zoo, a  children&#39;s <br/>\nmuseum, a great science museum, Laclede&#39;s Landing, Riverboat  gambling, and of <br/>\ncourse, the beautiful Arch (with its Lewis & Clark Museum  underneath). It&#39;s a <br/>\nshort drive to Hannibal, MO, childhood home of Mark Twain,  and Cahokia Mounds, a <br/>\nMississippian settlement that disappeared (and totally  peaceful---I love to <br/>\nwalk around and drink up the quiet energy).<br/>\n <br/>\nThe conference will be October 6th-9th. I was petitioned by a large group  of <br/>\nattendees to extend the conference to five days, but we compromised with  <br/>\nfour---so we&#39;ll be starting on Thursday this year. We have some exciting  new <br/>\nspeakers as well as our popular standards, Sandra and Anne. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThe website should be up before the end of the year. I&#39;ll point you in that  <br/>\ndirection as soon as it&#39;s up and operational.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe hotel contract should be signed by the end of this week: I&#39;ll get that  <br/>\nout to you the day it happens, so that you can make your reservations as soon <br/>\nas  possible. If I were to give it out now, y&#39;all would bombard them, and they <br/>\nmight  not have us in the system yet---so please be patient! &lt;g&gt; But we got  a <br/>\nsuper room rate with several huge ballrooms, a great lay-out, and an  indoor <br/>\npool! There&#39;s an hotel restaurant and several within walking distance or  a <br/>\nVERY short drive.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have lots of great volunteers already, but if you have a talent you&#39;d  like <br/>\nto share, please let me know.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m looking forward to hosting the conference again---and VERY much looking  <br/>\nforward to seeing you all in October!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\nConference Coordinator, 2005 Live and Learn Unschooling  Conference<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21323,"nextTopicId":21328}}
