Would they get upset that someone <br/>\nelse was telling their kids to stop? Something similar happened <br/>\naround here...girl throwing rocks at a car and wouldn&#39;t stop, so the <br/>\nowner of the car ended up raising his voice and the parents were <br/>\nhorrified about it. No, not about the fact that their dd was throwing <br/>\nrocks...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;d probably go to the parents after the first incident and <br/>\nsay something along the lines of &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sure you want to take care <br/>\nof this yourself: Johnny just did such and such and I know you don&#39;t <br/>\nwant that going on. I&#39;ll let you talk to him and keep him from having <br/>\nmore problems.&quot; And then the next time &quot;What happened with Johnny? It <br/>\nseems like he really needs your help.

Well, of <br/>\ncourse, they are coming!  They have three children, mom is home with <br/>\nthem all the time and often seems to be out of her element.  My dh has <br/>\nnoticed that when they are at a party (the two neighborhood, outdoor <br/>\nparties we&#39;ve had), nobody watches the kids.  It looks to me that the <br/>\nmom just wants a break from being solely responsible for the kids, and <br/>\nher dh seems to be totally clueless that she isn&#39;t watching them.  The <br/>\nmom will make comments to her dh, but not actually ask him to help <br/>\ndirectly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, their oldest is just five and at the parties we&#39;ve had outside <br/>\njust wanders around stomping on plants, pulling large parts of plants <br/>\nup, dismantling lights, hitting other children, taking things from <br/>\nothers, etc.  This absolutely drives my dh crazy, and he is afraid that <br/>\nthis little boy will wander around our house tearing things up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can I do (other than spend the entire party with this child)?  Are <br/>\nthere some things I can do to help this child feel comfortable?  Is <br/>\nthere something brilliant I can say to the parents?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest babysits for this family, and I hope they are not expecting <br/>\nher to be responsible for their children during our party - my daughter <br/>\nwill have her own friends attending and I don&#39;t feel it fair to ask her <br/>\nto get involved in this.  I, of course, will have hosting duties and <br/>\nwant to make sure that everything goes smoothly without spending all my <br/>\ntime with this one situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoni Zander<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FotoCEO@...\">FotoCEO@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101667,"nextTopicId":101644}}
