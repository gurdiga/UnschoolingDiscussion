Perhaps a suggestion that people keep all<br/>\ncorrespondence dealing with a difficult poster until the differences are<br/>\nsettled so everyone keeps in mind that anything they say privately can be<br/>\nturned over to the moderators? I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the best solution or not.<br/>\nSuggestions/discussion are more than welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, on the list of how to post and other suggestions, my suggestion is that<br/>\n&gt; you take it up with the list owner.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a possibility. I&#39;ll ask Helen before putting her on as a contact. Or<br/>\nperhaps as the contact if the moderators can&#39;t resolve something. She&#39;s<br/>\nmentioned a number of times over the years that she trusts people to be able<br/>\nto monitor themselves. I interpret that as meaning she doesn&#39;t want to be<br/>\nour babysitter.
