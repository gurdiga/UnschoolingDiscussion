JJ<br/>\n<br/>\nOctober 16, 2003<br/>\nA Coach&#39;s Digital Tools Take Center Court<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/16/technology/circuits/16tenn.html?th=&\">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/16/technology/circuits/16tenn.html?th=&</a><br/>\npagewanted=print&position=<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE serve explodes off Jeff Salzenstein&#39;s racket. It is a round yellow <br/>\nmissile, traveling 130 miles per hour and capable of freezing the world&#39;s top tennis <br/>\nplayers in their Reeboks. But this rocket underscores its server&#39;s <br/>\nconsternation. If he can hit a ball like this, Salzenstein wonders until it hurts, why <br/>\nmust he toil only on the outskirts of greatness?<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter the nutritionist, spiritual adviser, stretching coach and yoga <br/>\ninstructor. Salzenstein consults each to help him to rise above his world tennis <br/>\nranking: No. 125, or relative obscurity. And he comes here, to the Peninsula Tennis <br/>\nClub, to sit in front of John Yandell&#39;s &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=SNE&quot;\">http://www.nytimes.com/redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=SNE&quot;</a>&gt;Sony&lt;/A&gt; laptop computer and figure out <br/>\nif ones and zeroes will at last unlock his full potential. . .<br/>\n<br/>\nThe major sports increasingly employ technology not just to improve their <br/>\nequipment and safety, but also to train, using computers to quantify performance <br/>\nand help athletes push their potential. Tennis has not been in the forefront, <br/>\nbut Yandell believes the future of the sport&#39;s instruction will revolve around <br/>\ndigital imagery, and he is working with Salzenstein to prove his point.<br/>\n<br/>\nA coach with a Yale history degree who once tutored John McEnroe on his <br/>\nserve, Yandell proposes a seemingly simple concept. He wants to use digital <br/>\nphotography to break down the serves, forehands and backhands of the greatest players <br/>\nof all time, then let others modify their own swings to incorporate some of <br/>\nthe most successful techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe plans to videotape the world&#39;s best players in three dimensions using <br/>\nsuper-high-speed digital cameras. Then he wants to reduce the tennis swing to a <br/>\nscience; he wants to measure the precise position of the arm at impact, the path <br/>\nof the racket head over the full swing, and the speed and angles of body <br/>\nrotation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe would like to change the way people teach tennis, which he said is &quot;an <br/>\ninvisible game&quot; because neither coaches nor fans really know what is happening. <br/>\nThe trouble, he said, is that the swing happens so quickly that the naked eye <br/>\ncannot pick up what separates the swing mechanics of the greats from mere <br/>\nmortals or near-greats like Jeff Salzenstein.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The basic issues of technique are in complete disarray, confusion and <br/>\ndispute among the so-called experts and authorities,&quot; Yandell said. &quot;If you get the <br/>\nbest coaches after a couple of beers, they&#39;ll tell you, &#39;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s <br/>\nreally happening.&#39; &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83492,"nextTopicId":83509}}
