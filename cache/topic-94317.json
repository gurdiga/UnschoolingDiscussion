So, never having been drawn to hold babies or coo over them, <br/>\nI really had no interest in them. <br/>\n<br/>\n Medically I was supposed to not be able to have children.  Secretly I wasn&#39;t <br/>\ntoo upset about it.  At my preop visit for a surgery to &quot;possibly&quot; make it <br/>\npossible to get pregnant I found out I WAS pregnant.  I admit I was just sorta <br/>\ngoing along with the program to please DH and let him think I&#39;d done all I <br/>\ncould do to provide him with a family that he wanted, while secretly thinking it <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be so bad without children.<br/>\n<br/>\nUp until the moment I pushed her out, I was still afraid that for some reason <br/>\nI would be unable to love my own child.  I asked my DH if I didn&#39;t love her <br/>\nwould he just take her away and divorce me and raise her.  He thought it was <br/>\nthe &quot;drugs&quot; talking.  It was the fear of being like my mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gave birth, she was taken to the nursery and I was sent to recovery for a <br/>\nshort time, then I got to hold my baby.  Taking a deep breath, I took her and <br/>\nlooked into her face and as she snuggled against my chest, her head turned <br/>\ntowards my breast and she began to try to nurse.  At that moment I feel INSTANTLY <br/>\nand deeply in love with her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience was mostly the same for my sons.  My next daughter, six weeks <br/>\nearly, was not the same.  Possibly after reading Danielle&#39;s note I might have <br/>\nmade a connection.  Cait was sent to the NICU right away.  It took months for <br/>\nme to form any bond with her.  I cried because I couldn&#39;t.  Nursing was very <br/>\ndifficult.  I met her needs but didn&#39;t feel that &quot;I never want to put her down&quot; <br/>\nfeeling I&#39;d had with the others.  The only child I needed a lactation <br/>\nconsultant for and this was child number four.  I felt like a failure.  Looking back I <br/>\nthink if I&#39;d had that experience with my first child, I probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave had five.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo tell the absolute truth I think that firm deep bonding with Cait didn&#39;t <br/>\nhappen until after she left school for good and we could spend hours together <br/>\njust doing nothing.  For the most part the other kids were already up and out of <br/>\nthe house by then.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still embarrassed because of it, I wish it could have been different.  I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t neglectful in anyway to her but just was detached.  I think she felt <br/>\nthe same way, she wanted to be fed, wrapped and put down.  She didn&#39;t like being <br/>\nheld, she didn&#39;t like being cuddled.  To this day you cannot hug her without <br/>\nher saying, &quot; I want a hug&quot; first.

I remember after the midwives <br/>\nleft, the friends went home, and seamus&#39; father went to work (!!! can <br/>\nya believe it?? left me with an hours old baby all alone!grrr), i sat <br/>\nin my empty apt and thought &quot;they are really just going to leave me <br/>\nwith this baby??

There were studies done 30 years ago or so in which children<br/>\nwere given <br/>\nsealed plastic bags to smell.  Each had a t-shirt that was worn for a<br/>\nplay <br/>\nsession or a day or something.  One was a sibling, the others weren&#39;t.<br/>\nThe kids <br/>\nwere able to identify their siblings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember what the explanation was at the time, but I&#39;ve thought<br/>\nof it <br/>\nover the years.  I think the children probably smell like the<br/>\nmother.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThere is evidence that there is a relationship between a person&#39;s scent<br/>\nand the HLA gene, which expresses a protein that is present on virtually<br/>\nall cells of the body.  HLA is unique to an individual, and it is<br/>\nlargely responsible for graft vs. host disease in organ transplants.  It<br/>\nis basically the protein on the cell that identifies it to your immune<br/>\nsystem as &quot;self&quot;.  That&#39;s why transplants are rejected-the host doesn&#39;t<br/>\nrecognize the HLA on the transplanted organ.  If HLA and scent are<br/>\nrelated, it follows that children will smell more like their parents<br/>\nthan other adults, and that siblings will smell more like each other<br/>\nthan other children.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHere&#39;s the really neat stuff though:  In one study, college age women<br/>\nwere asked to smell the t-shirts of various men and rate the<br/>\n&quot;attractiveness&quot; of the smell.  The women were the most attracted to the<br/>\nt-shirts of the men whose HLA was the most *different* from their own.<br/>\nIn other words, when choosing mates, we are attracted to those who are<br/>\ngenetically different from ourselves.  That&#39;s a good thing for the sake<br/>\nof maintaining high genetic diversity in a population and for producing<br/>\noffspring with good genetic diversity, which increases their ability to<br/>\nadapt to their environment.   This same phenomenon has also been shown<br/>\nin mice.<br/>\n <br/>\n            But the really cool thing is that when women/female mice are<br/>\npregnant or nursing (or on the pill, which simulates pregnancy), their<br/>\nattraction to others switches from those whose HLA is the most different<br/>\nto those whose HLA is the most SIMILAR!  This also makes good sense for<br/>\nsurvival, for it&#39;s definitely in the best interest of the babies for the<br/>\nmother to be attracted to their scent.  The female mice also prefer the<br/>\ncompany of their own siblings, which are the babies&#39; aunts and uncles,<br/>\nwho are likely to help care for them.  This is bad news for the poor<br/>\ndads, however :;  Luckily it switches back when the mother starts to<br/>\novulate again.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe authors of these studies have even gone so far as to suggest that<br/>\nthe pill can cause relationship problems because a woman will be<br/>\nattracted to a man with similar HLA while on the pill, then she&#39;ll go<br/>\noff the pill and discover that she&#39;s not so attracted to him any more!<br/>\n <br/>\nPretty neat stuff.<br/>\n <br/>\nJenny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4324016,"authorName":"Kelly Lenhart","from":"&quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; &lt;mina@...&gt;","profile":"mommamina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: biological questions regarding adoption","postDate":"1085106717","msgId":94368,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA3ODIwMWM0M2VkYiRjYTFlNzQ5MCRmZDAwYThjMEBKZW5ueT4=","referencesHeader":"PEJDRDJBMkRELjczOTMlYWJ6YkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":94367,"nextInTopic":94372,"prevInTime":94367,"nextInTime":94369,"topicId":94317,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I know two women who were adopted and breastfed by their adoptive Moms. <br/>\n <br/>\nI think the smell thing would have to be that children smell like their mother. I&#39;ve noticed in friend&#39;s babies that the baby definitely smells like Mom, and I&#39;ve had at least one friend tell me my baby smelled like me.  Of course, my sense of smell is overly sensitive, so that may be part of it for me.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt also makes sense in that we&#39;re mammals, and the way a mama in the wild knows which ones are hers is by their scent.  I think sniffing our children&#39;s heads is a leftover, primitive urge, a way to re-connect and stimulate the mother hormones that impel us to protect and love our young at all costs.  Unfortunately, that instinct gets lost amont the aroma of babywash, baby lotion, perfumed diapers and other products meant to make babies smell &#39;sweet&#39; and sterile.  Disposable diapers have the most cloying odor to them, it just overwhelms everything else.  I was amazed at how much better (and truer) my youngest smelled -- how much better our home smelled.  I&#39;m convinced it was because we used cloth diapers with him.  Over the generations, we&#39;ve become programmed to different smells in our environment, and I think they overcome our more natural impulses. <br/>\n <br/>\nSyl  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
