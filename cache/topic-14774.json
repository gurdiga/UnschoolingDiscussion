Not even sure what it is.<br/>\nBut my fist thought is to not burn anything plant-based as it can<br/>\nlikely be used to enhance your property at some point.  In<br/>\npermaculture -- earth healing -- you want to use available and local<br/>\nresources.  Established fruit trees and vines are a blessing!  I<br/>\nbelieve truly sustainable practices are best.  Chems are on the way<br/>\nout because of their destructive and persistent characteristics.<br/>\nOrganic is a decent middle ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for resources, a beginner in permaculture might seek out a<br/>\nfundamentals course.  They are offered around the US and the world.  I<br/>\nknow of one coming up soon here in Austin, TX but not sure where you<br/>\nare.  An eco-village in North Carolina, Earth Haven<br/>\n(www.earthaven.org) has a lot of information for folks.  Instructors<br/>\nof permaculture live there.<br/>\n<br/>\nPermaculture involves taking responsibility for what comes into and<br/>\ngoes out of your life.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou probably found the permaculture.com website right off.  There is<br/>\nalso a site based in the UK: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.permaculture.co.uk/\">http://www.permaculture.co.uk/</a> which has<br/>\na magazine.  Another magazine is Permaculture Activist:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.permacultureactivist.net/.\">http://www.permacultureactivist.net/.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course, the publications: Introduction to Permaculture by Bill<br/>\nMollison and Reny Mia Slay, and the primer Permaculture, A Designer&#39;s<br/>\nManual by Bill Mollison.  A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander<br/>\nis is a classic.
