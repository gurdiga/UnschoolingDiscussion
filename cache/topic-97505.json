There are plastic toys that don&#39;t survive being in <br/>\nthe yard in New Mexico, and once it dries out, it will break down into pieces <br/>\nas tiny as sand.  Sand isn&#39;t biodegradable either, and the desert is full of <br/>\nit.   Iron, in our yard.  The kids pick it up with magnets after it rains and <br/>\nthe water runs off.   That&#39;s not biodegradable.  Glass?  well... it turns back <br/>\nto the sand it started off as.   Metal?  Rusts away eventually.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Biodegradable&quot; is a buzzword with a lot of &quot;oooh!&quot; appeal, and I&#39;m sorry <br/>\nstyrofoam was ever invented, but not all plastic is evil.   Much of what we use <br/>\nplastic for would have been glass or metal, and their creation, transportion <br/>\nand disposal aren&#39;t all air and fairies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for people to invent something 50 years ago and then declare that it will <br/>\nsit in a landfill &quot;forever&quot; (the inventors probably aren&#39;t the same ones who <br/>\ndeclared &quot;forever&quot;) is shortsighted and arrogant.     <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the early-plastic stuff they used to make brushes and mirror-frames <br/>\nout of and knife handles and such?

Also used in auto padding, like inside ceiling liners.  Maybe not <br/>\neverywhere, but in the desert that seems to last 20 some years and then turn to dust.  <br/>\n Rubber itself is tree stuff that turns back to dirt stuff.  I took a <br/>\ndoorbell apart yesterday, cleaned the parts.  It won&#39;t go back together.  The little <br/>\nrubber holders for the chimes are too dried up and old.

Rubber, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAuto restoration people will know what lasts on a car.   Seats, of 1920&#39;s <br/>\ncars? Horsehair and rotten upholstery have to be replaced.   Dashboards of 60&#39;s <br/>\ncars?  Not in the desert.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf plastic lasted forever, houses could be made of it!
