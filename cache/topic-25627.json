In fact it has prompted me to act in total opposition of these ideals.  I&#39;m leaving the list in light of this and I would urge any Christians on this list that end up feeling like they are beat up, angry and disgusted by what they read here to reconsider your reasons why you are on this list.  There are lists out there that are diverse and allow all kinds of views but which aren&#39;t quite so hateful toward one another.  I would ask you to consider adding your support to these lists.  Good luck in your unschooling adventure.<br/>\nRachel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25587,"nextTopicId":25547}}
