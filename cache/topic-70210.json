When I got back to <br/>\n&gt; my class the teacher had obviously announced that I was going to get the <br/>\n&gt; paddle because I disobeyed him.  I saw it in his hand and ran right back <br/>\n&gt; out of that room all the way to the principal&#39;s office and told him that <br/>\n&gt; I wanted to call my mom to pick me up because my teacher wanted to <br/>\n&gt; paddle me for using the bathroom.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lucky for me the principal just loved me and chewed the teacher out in <br/>\n&gt; front of me.  hee hee!  I did call my mom who came and got me and my dad <br/>\n&gt; left work when he got wind of it and told this guy he&#39;d &quot;kick his a$$&quot; <br/>\n&gt; if he so much as thought of touching me.

We were graded on how high we <br/>\ngot, and to get an A you had to touch the ceiling. I was terrified of the <br/>\nheights, and didn&#39;t have the upper body strength to do it anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was really upset that I was going to fail...GYM!!!!!  I told my parents, <br/>\nand the next day my father, who rarely got involved in the school stuff, called <br/>\nthe gym teacher and told her that I would NOT be climbing the rope if I didn&#39;t <br/>\nfeel comfortable doing it, and that I would NOT be punished for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe man has his moments.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70065,"nextTopicId":70176}}
