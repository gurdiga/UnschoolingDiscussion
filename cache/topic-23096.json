Of course, people will do what they think<br/>\n&quot;best&quot; for their child, or at least what their &quot;jealous God&quot; demands.

We know this because Moses<br/>\nactually had to command the circumcision of Hebrews while they were in the<br/>\ndesert -- most were uncircumcised.  So we can say that if the Jews of this time<br/>\nknew of the legacy of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, etc., etc., that legacy<br/>\ndefinitely did NOT include circumcision.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course the jealous God could have wanted a piece of an earlobe, or the left<br/>\nlittle toe.

Figure that one out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, people have strange customs.

Write up what you want<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want, get them to fasten it in your folder, have copies for others<br/>\nwhen<br/>\n&gt; you get there, and remind them it exists.

I had to argue to keep Holly in the room with<br/>\n&gt; me, even though she was my third.  That was less than ten years ago.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But on the better news front, a friend just had a three-month-premature<br/>\nbaby<br/>\n&gt; three days ago and they waited for her milk to come in before giving him<br/>\n&gt; anything except IV fluids into his umbilical cord/stump/place/thing.

The day our son was born his dad got stuck in New York <br/>\nand didn&#39;t make it back to Calif in time...long story.  Anyway, the <br/>\nday after his birth the dr came to my hospital room (we had a C-<br/>\nsection)and asked if I still wanted a circumcision.  Our son was born <br/>\n10 lbs 15 oz and was 22 1/2 inches long.  The dr explained that <br/>\nbecause of his size he would have to take him into an operating room <br/>\nand give him a general anesnetic to perform this operation.  I of <br/>\ncourse said &quot;WHAT??&quot;  This seemed extreme even in my post operative, <br/>\nconfused mind.  I then followed with &quot;no way - no how&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I spoke with dad on the phone that day he went ballistic.  <br/>\n(Being 3000 miles away and unable to get a flight back home was <br/>\ncausing him a lot of grief...Stress was sending him way over the top <br/>\nthat day.) I ended up hanging up on him (twice).  When he had calmed <br/>\ndown he called back again and listened when I told him what the dr <br/>\nhad actually said.  His response was &quot;Don&#39;t let that quack anywhere <br/>\nnear my son!&quot;  When we all got home safely we had a long talk (daddy <br/>\ntalked with two other doctors) and we decided circumcision was not <br/>\ngoing to happen.  Since then (1985) he has read a lot about this <br/>\nprocedure and is thankful I made this decision. When our youngest son <br/>\nwas born the subject never even came up.  Uninformed decisions about <br/>\nhealth care are made every day in stressful situations.  I wish I had <br/>\nhad some kind of a health care advocate with me that day who was not <br/>\nconnected with the dr or the hospital or the insurance company.<br/>\n<br/>\nJan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Vicki A.
