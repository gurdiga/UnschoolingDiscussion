Sit down<br/>\nand talk to him, I mean really talk to him, not just lecture ... it may be<br/>\nan issue of jealousy or he just may not be getting it with regard to his<br/>\nbehavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes having a quiet conversation where the child is made to THINK and<br/>\nnot allowed to answer with an &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;just because&quot; can be more<br/>\npainful than a &quot;simple&quot; spanking.  Make him connect his behaviors with<br/>\nconsequences and feelings and be empathetic with his sister&#39;s position in<br/>\nthis.  Try explaining that he needs to be more mature in his response to the<br/>\nsituation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, start taking away previliges and toys.  I personally use all types of<br/>\ndiscipline ... from counting to three to time-outs to restrictions to<br/>\nspanking as an absolute last resort.  My kids know that I had better not<br/>\nhave to get to the spanking part because if I do, there are also other<br/>\npunishments that go with it including a lecture from me, from their dad, and<br/>\nextreme loss of privileges ... I consider it just that serious ... the older<br/>\nthey get the less this has been necessary, I haven&#39;t had to reach this level<br/>\nwith my 11 year old and 8 year old for over a year.  I just had to spank my<br/>\nfive year old last week ... but it was for continuation of some unsafe<br/>\nbehaviors with the two year old, behaviors that she had previously been<br/>\ndisciplined for in other ways.  In addition to the spanking and lecture, she<br/>\nwent a week without tv (not that we watch that much anyway) and lost pool<br/>\nprivileges and a few other things as well.  She almost slipped into the old<br/>\nproblem again yesterday and I reminded her of the consequences and if she<br/>\nwanted them to be strung out longer .... it flipped the light switch on and<br/>\nso far so good.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue for the parent is CONSISTENCY.  Whatever you do, it must be<br/>\nconsistent!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor your son, I would try the conversation about WHY he&#39;s doing what he is<br/>\ndoing.  There are some siblings that just really grate on each other&#39;s<br/>\nnerves, their personalities just don&#39;t mesh well.  You may wind up having to<br/>\nmake allowances for that.  You son might get irritated when she invades his<br/>\nspace ... physically and emotionally.  There could be any number of<br/>\nnon-obvious reasons for his behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nFolks like me can tell you what WE do and give lots of advice &lt;wry grin&gt; but<br/>\nin truth, sometimes you just have to find out what works for you and your<br/>\nfamily ... down to what works with each child individually.  Wish I had more<br/>\nto offer you.  I deal with a similar issue between my five year old daughter<br/>\nand two year old daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy in FL     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamkmm2@...\">mamkmm2@...</a><br/>\nMy Website:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.easyfunschool.com\">http://www.easyfunschool.com</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 07, 2001 1:30 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1212<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 2<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 07 May 2001 11:52:37 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vouget@...\">vouget@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Constant fighting<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4yods keeps grabbing things away from 1 1/2yodd, and pushing her, and<br/>\n&gt; yelling at her, etc.  I just don&#39;t know what to do anymore.  Nothing<br/>\n&gt; seems to work.  Telling him not to, or just holding her and saying<br/>\n&gt; something like, &quot;I&#39;m so sad.  I don&#39;t like to see Rachel cry&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; anything.  I can&#39;t leave them alone together for half a minute, and<br/>\n&gt; even when I&#39;m there, he does this.  She still loves her brother, but<br/>\n&gt; she seems to be afraid of him sometimes.  Any suggestions??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Melanie in Indiana </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20749,"nextTopicId":20758}}
