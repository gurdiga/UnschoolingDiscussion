Comments welcome!-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a political tussle among some of the upper-level kind of <br/>\nhomeschooling movers and shakers about whether those who register with a program should <br/>\nstill be considered homeschoolers.  Some say no, some say yes.   The related <br/>\narguments to consider are that if someone is still a homeschooler even though he <br/>\nuses ABeka or Sonlight or Calvert or Oak Meadow or Clonlara, because they&#39;ve <br/>\nbought a kit but they aren&#39;t registered with a school system, why is he NOT a <br/>\nhomeschooler for registering with a school system?  If they don&#39;t provide a <br/>\ncurriculum, or test kids or make them do things against their will, is it still <br/>\nhomeschooling?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the easy answer it looks like at first.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are programs in California like the one you&#39;re describing.   When the <br/>\nliason person understands unschooling, and there&#39;s money available for a piano <br/>\nor dance lessons or something expensive like that, but the child is still <br/>\nlearning naturally from all the world around, I don&#39;t personally see it as evil.  <br/>\nBut it is, technically, an alternative school program.<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent people homeschool for different reasons. For me, it&#39;s not <br/>\npolitical.  It&#39;s more a wholeness and emotional health thing.  I wanted Kirby to be <br/>\nwhole and unbroken by other kids and by teachers who wanted him to conform.  He&#39;s <br/>\n18 now; it worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nI care about how children learn and live, not about what the statistics of <br/>\nthe government are, or how state taxes are disbursed.  That&#39;s just me.  Some <br/>\nothers feel more strongly and more politically, I know.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Unschooling with a Distributed Learning Program?","postDate":"1092505038","msgId":97899,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwODE0MTczNzE4LjI0NjAyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMzMwMWM0ODIxNCRmODk2NDE1MCRkMWIxYjVkMEB3aW5kb3dzMms4d3pnbT4="},"prevInTopic":97896,"nextInTopic":97906,"prevInTime":97898,"nextInTime":97900,"topicId":97896,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Will there be any kind of testing going on?

A friend of mine enrolled their 2 daughters in the program for some of the same reasons you mentioned-- resources galore.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBut,  there was testing.  I believe that my friend knew about the testing but didn&#39;t think it would be a big deal.  But when testing did come around, one of her daughters really was troubled with it.  If the kids didn&#39;t test at a certain level the funding would be questioned.  Because then the &quot;learning cooperative&quot;  wouldn&#39;t be meeting the state standards.<br/>\n <br/>\nAfter having to do this testing, the one daughter who was having a hard time with it really questioned her own learning and abilities.  It was very sad.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nSo that is one experience with it.

It may (or may not) be a Canadian thing. The purpose i believe is for schools to draw  homeschoolers to get more funding for their school from the ministry.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, there&#39;s a program offered at a small local alternative school where i registered my 7yo son as a &quot;homeschooler&quot; last year. The only reason i would join is that they offer $1300 per year to spend on &quot;homelearning supplies&quot; which includes books, games, &quot;fieldtrips&quot;, lessons, musical instruments, sports and computer equipment etc--pretty open. We live on a very low income so this would be a big bonus. Other parents have bought pianos, computers, cameras, cool art supplies, a year&#39;s worth of music lessons etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe could also participate if he wishes in the school play, field trips and an hour per week of parent-led &quot;explorations&quot; (anything from pottery to rocket-building) but he can do this anyway as a registered homeschooler. So the only advantage is the money and a few extras like library use at a near-by bigger school, weekly homeschoolers gym, ocassional science workshops and special speakers/mentors etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s required is that I meet with the teacher 3 times per year to discuss a &quot;learning plan&quot; (yes, we plan to learn :-)) and to discuss whether he has met provincial learning outcomes (things like &quot;can count to 100&quot;, &quot;understands a story that is read to him&quot; and similar ilk). It basically means speaking a bit of educationese, showing her a couple of things we&#39;ve been doing (a few drawings or a photograph of child feeding the chickens etc is accepted). <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son never has to meet her. She seems pretty open and accepting of unschooling ideas, as far as she understands them. I know a few parents who have done the program from the school at homers to very loose unschoolish types and so far the handful of people i&#39;ve talked to are happy with it. Apparently the teacher is satisfied with answers like &quot;we haven&#39;t done that&quot;, &quot;he can&#39;t count that far&quot; and &quot;i don&#39;t believe in early reading if the child doesn&#39;t want to&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut i&#39;m still a little wary and dh is pretty suspicious and concerned about possibility of the government getting their fingers in our child&#39;s affairs. I&#39;m uncomfortable with the idea of answering to anyone about my son&#39;s learning but we kind of see it as a silly hoop to jump through to get the benefits. We can of course quit at any time, so i&#39;m seriously considering it. Our son is totally willing as long as it doesn&#39;t affect what he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone here have experience or feedback on working with such a program as a life learner/unschooler?
