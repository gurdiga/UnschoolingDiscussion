Things she","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1075717160\">I&#39;ve been thinking, and I think one of the reasons I was never comfortable talking to my mom was that she was (and is) very judgemental of others. Things she does herself even, will receive negative comments if she sees others doing the same. Although she was always accepting of anything the family said or did, that attitude towards others really bothered me. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: Marji<br/>\n<br/>\n  My parents were not at all accessible to me.  They were filled with <br/>\n  judgment and quite frankly they were not always honest with me.  In fact, <br/>\n  they subtly communicated with me that they did not want to know the awful <br/>\n  truths from me, though I think they might deny this (they definitely would <br/>\n  have denied it then, maybe not now, though).  But, my mother wanted to <br/>\n  believe I was someone I was not and really did not want to see me for who I <br/>\n  was.  When I was a kid faced with tough choices, I did not have my mom and <br/>\n  dad to turn to - ever - and I regret this now.  I can see with my excellent <br/>\n  hindsight that I could have had a much easier time of it and maybe avoided <br/>\n  some hardships if I could have had the benefit of their expertise.  It&#39;s <br/>\n  good for me to remember this, though, because I am reminded to be conscious <br/>\n  about accepting Liam for who he is, not who I want him to be.   I&#39;m a <br/>\n  pacifist, but Liam likes to play fighting games.  He and I are different <br/>\n  people, but I accept him, and I learn from him because we are different.  I <br/>\n  don&#39;t think my folks were ever able to go there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~marji~<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
