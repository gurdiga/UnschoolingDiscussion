When they were younger it was a huge source of <br/>\nfrustration to Sarah how easily Patrick picked stuff up. He not only learned <br/>\nto read without trying when she was the one who really really wanted to read, <br/>\nhe played with math for fun in his head while she had to slowly ponder <br/>\neverything. And of course the only things people ever ask about are math and <br/>\nreading. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first time she came up with the answer to a math problem they were both <br/>\ncontemplating before he did it shocked the heck out of everyone in the room. <br/>\n(It was something for a game - adding scores maybe, or maybe it was a mileage <br/>\nthing.) It doesn&#39;t happen often, but because they think in different ways <br/>\nabout math every so often her way works out faster than his does, even though <br/>\nhe&#39;s definitely both more interested in math and more accomplished at it. She <br/>\nhas definitely &quot;caught up&quot; - acheived competence at the kind of stuff that <br/>\ncomes up normally around here - the not coming up normally stuff he&#39;s <br/>\nexploring all on his own without her though. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: reading age WAS vision therapy","postDate":"1027622477","msgId":39429,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNkLjIxYmI3MThjLjJhNzFhMDRkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39426,"nextInTopic":39460,"prevInTime":39428,"nextInTime":39430,"topicId":39426,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/25/02 12:08:14 PM, dacunefare@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-693977481\">In a message dated 7/25/02 12:08:14 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dacunefare@...\">dacunefare@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Twins - one boy reading fluently at 6, one girl reading fluently at 10. <br/>\nGirl <br/>\nstruggled with reading, wanted desparately to read but had great difficulty, <br/>\nboy picked it up seemingly effortlessly and didn&#39;t much care one way or the <br/>\nother.
