I<br/>\nknow this topic has been discussed before, but I need help.  A good friend<br/>\nis telling me to look into FMS, as she thinks I am a prime candidate for<br/>\nsuch a diagnosis.  I really am starting to feel like some kind of<br/>\nhypochondriac because I always seem to be sick.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci,<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I could have wrote that post!  I doubt that I will be any help, as I<br/>\nam still trying to solve my health issues, but I totally empathize.  I, too<br/>\nam an infrequent poster, by the time I read the posts I&#39;ve accumulated, I&#39;m<br/>\nusually too tired or &#39;fuzzy-headed&#39; to write any meaningful replies.  I do<br/>\nhave a Rheumatologist, that would probably be the specialist to see for<br/>\nFibromyalgia.  I have many of the symptoms of FMS, but I don&#39;t respond to<br/>\nthe particular pressure points that are used for a diagnosis.  My symptoms<br/>\ncome & go, and I have a history of autoimmune disease since early childhood.<br/>\nFor awhile Lupus seemed to be the concern, but again I don&#39;t meet all the<br/>\nqualifications for that dx.  I do have &#39;positive&#39; lab results for some<br/>\nautoimmune disorders, but I don&#39;t have the symptoms that match those.  I&#39;m<br/>\nsupposed to have an MRI to check for MS, as soon as my insurance gives the<br/>\nokay.  Another thing I&#39;ve read about is hormone problems, such as<br/>\nprogesterone deficiencies, but that&#39;s of course out of the mainstream, and<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure who to trust for alternative work anymore.  I originally was<br/>\nseeing a Nurse Practitioner in practice with a Homeopathic MD, their<br/>\nsuggestion was Prozac!  What has helped me is Cranial Sacral therapy, I&#39;ve<br/>\njust started again, used it last year and I went into a &#39;remission&#39; of<br/>\nsorts, don&#39;t know if it was related to the CST or not, but I&#39;m convinced it<br/>\ndid something.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the guilt feelings!  When I&#39;m laying on the bed totally wiped out, and<br/>\nmy  4 yr old is saying &quot;Play with me Mommy&quot;, oh that&#39;s the worst part of<br/>\nall.  Like I said, no answers, but lots of understanding........ Let me know<br/>\nif I can be of any other assistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy L. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15727,"nextTopicId":15685}}
