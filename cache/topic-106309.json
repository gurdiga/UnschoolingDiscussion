I stand there cooking<br/>\n& washing while I talk to him while he plays. He<br/>\nupdates me constantly on what he is playing and<br/>\nlearning. He makes me read his posts. I try my best to<br/>\nappear interested, even if I would prefer to finish<br/>\nthe housecleaning. I comment on his posts from a<br/>\ncreative writing standpoint since he asks me to.<br/>\nWhen he gets into conversations on forums that he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t understand or can&#39;t handle, he asks me for<br/>\nadvice. He knows, because I&#39;ve made it clear, that he<br/>\nshould never agree to meet anyone he meets online. If<br/>\nit did come up, I suppose I would do the same I would<br/>\ndo for any playdate, meet the parents first and<br/>\nsupervise the first few meetings.<br/>\nHe did recently type &quot;masturbation&quot; into google to<br/>\nfind out what it is. (he heard it on South Park.) I<br/>\nfound the trail of sites he&#39;d gone to. I told him that<br/>\nthis happens to be the one thing you can&#39;t get a<br/>\nstraight answer out of Google about. I answered all<br/>\nhis questions. I gave him the Kama Sutra to read. I<br/>\nspent weeks answering questions about perversions I<br/>\nwould rather he never learned about. On the other<br/>\nhand, I was glad he could learn about them from me<br/>\nrather than from anyone else, so I could put them into<br/>\nthe right emotional context (people who have been<br/>\nabused tend to develop addictions based on their abuse<br/>\nand then act them out).<br/>\nI thought about putting Parental Controls on my<br/>\ncomputer, but a computer geek friend I consulted told<br/>\nme that he would probably be able to figure out how to<br/>\nwork around them, and it might be better to just keep<br/>\ntalking to him about it.<br/>\nSo that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing.<br/>\nLOL: after he read the first few chapters of the Kama<br/>\nSutra he said to me: &quot;hey Mom, this is a really good<br/>\nbook. It says that you should get to know someone<br/>\nreally well before having sex with them.&quot;<br/>\nI said, &quot;well, you can say that again!!!&quot;<br/>\nAnna<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
