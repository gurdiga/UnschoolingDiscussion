What<br/>\ncan I do?&quot; We are seeing a dramatic rise in degenerative, chronic and<br/>\nautoimmune diseases, even in children. Diseases that were once unusual,<br/>\nsuch as chronic fatigue, severe allergies, asthma, fibromyalgia, diabetes,<br/>\ncandidiasis, severe digestive disorders and environmental/chemical<br/>\nsensitivities are becoming common. More people complain of getting<br/>\nrecurring colds, flu and infections. Each generation seems weaker than the<br/>\nlast. With all the nutritional supplements and advances in traditional<br/>\nmedicine, why is this happening?<br/>\n....<br/>\n       Generally, intestinal toxemia manifests as one or more of the<br/>\nfollowing: fatigue, nervousness, gastrointestinal upset, impaired<br/>\nnutrition, skin problems, circulatory problems, headaches, arthritis,<br/>\nsciatica and low back pain, allergy, asthma, eye, ear, nose and throat<br/>\ndisease, heart irregularities, appendicitis, diverticulitis, irritable<br/>\nbowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn¹s disease, diabetes, psoriasis,<br/>\nhigh blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and pathological changes<br/>\nin the breasts. All of these have responded to therapy directed at a<br/>\ntoxemic state in the&#39; intestine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I was just diagnosed with asthma (all 3 of my kids have it too) and my<br/>\n&gt; doctor immediatly started talking about me using an inhaled steroid<br/>\n&gt; (something my kids have never had to do).
