The authors talk about<br/>\nsomething that happens a lot in schools which they call &quot;downshifting.&quot; When<br/>\nthe students and teachers both don&#39;t have any real control over what they<br/>\nare learning/teaching and when they are to learn/teach it, they kind of go<br/>\ninto survival mode, where all they can do is rote memorization of &quot;what&#39;s<br/>\ngoing to be on the test.&quot; Critical thinking, creativity, and higher-order<br/>\nthinking go out the window. This is especially true in the age of<br/>\nstandardized tests, where teachers are forced to teach to the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book is &quot;Education on the Edge of Possibility&quot; by Renate Nummela Caine<br/>\nand Geoffrey Caine.<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom p. 18: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We also came to the conclusion that teaching for memorization of<br/>\nmeaningless facts and procedures dictated by someone else usually induces<br/>\ndownshifting. Downshifting is a psychophysiological response to threat<br/>\nassociated with fatigue or perceived helplessness or both. Downshifted<br/>\nlearners then bypass much of their capacity for higher-order functioning and<br/>\ncreative thought.&quot;<br/>\n-- <br/>\nThea<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:metta@...\">metta@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"MorelFam@aol.com","from":"MorelFam@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"_Lr4RYsSA6WJis572o1pt4Eju_98lYjqHacMjoHCh2EUJRaEuwuGVoqDdeArzA-h5F4ls8iLYw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"retention","postDate":"952628491","msgId":7084,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlmLjJiNmFmNGUuMjVmOTRmMGJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7094,"prevInTime":7083,"nextInTime":7085,"topicId":7084,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hey all, i am still sort of on the history thread, but my thoughts are on retention. i am reading different philosophies on remembering/learning info, and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-154004079\">hey all,<br/>\ni am still sort of on the history thread, but my thoughts are on retention.  <br/>\ni am reading different philosophies on remembering/learning info, and would <br/>\nlove some more thoughts from you live ones.  generally, i retain only things <br/>\nthat are important to me at the time of learning.  but also generally, i have <br/>\nterrible retention...  i think it is actually a coping mechanism i learned in <br/>\nschool!  it made my school life quite efficient, but i think has damaged my <br/>\nability to retain info now, too.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1630,"nextTopicId":7096}}
