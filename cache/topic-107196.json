I have always worried about all the &#39;what ifs&#39;, and as well about <br/>\nhow the kids would feel about it. Even when I have written in our local <br/>\nnewsletter, I have sometimes felt that the kids felt pressure. So when <br/>\ndo I write the book that it won&#39;t either refect badly on unschooling <br/>\n(especially to people that aren&#39;t &#39;there&#39; yet), or be embarrassing to my <br/>\nboys!.......<br/>\n<br/>\nYes!

But you know what? I&#39;ve had my kids say, well, so <br/>\nwhat? we don&#39;t care about people like that. They are so secure in their <br/>\nown selves after being raised in a way less unschooling way than yours, <br/>\nSandra. I think you should talk to your kids about your fears, and you <br/>\nmay find that they aren&#39;t bothered. My #2 son (21) was just talking <br/>\nyesterday about how the people he works with are &#39;not dumb, they have <br/>\njust never had the chance to learn how to think for themselves&#39; and  it <br/>\nseems that rather than feel put down by them, he feels sorry for them <br/>\nfor being so stuck in a thoughtless world! Despite all the mistakes I <br/>\nhave made with my kids, they are really cool people: it&#39;s my own <br/>\ninsecurities that are the real barrier - it&#39;s just easier to use the <br/>\nexcuse of the effect on them! What a wonderful person I am to put my <br/>\naspirations to become a world famous author and education guru to one <br/>\nside for the sake of my beloved fragile babies.  That sounds so much <br/>\nbetter than, &#39;I&#39;m scared! whinge, whine...&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you know what, Sandra? If you had come before me timewise, and had <br/>\nwritten an unschooling book that I had read before I started on this <br/>\npath, then my life and the life of all four of my children - but <br/>\nespecially my eldest son - would have been even better. It&#39;s not your <br/>\njob, or mine, to raise the world&#39;s children, but IF you have the time, <br/>\nIF you have the energy, then talk to your family, let them choose if the <br/>\nrisks to them are too great, and then if they agree, go for it because <br/>\nwhat you have to offer, is so very much needed in this world.<br/>\n<br/>\nCally</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Book?","postDate":"1121197552","msgId":107221,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDNzU1MzE3MjU2NUEwQy0zNjAtMTExNjBATUJMSy1NMzYuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwNzEyMTcxMjQ0LjM4NzIxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjgxNTEwLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":107220,"nextInTopic":107223,"prevInTime":107220,"nextInTime":107222,"topicId":107196,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You <br/>\nemphasize that you want people to &quot;get it&quot; ASAP, before it&#39;s too <br/>\nlate for the kid. Well, can you use that same desire to help kids <br/>\nyou don&#39;t know, NOW, before it&#39;s too late for them? Will you share <br/>\nyourself with a more general audience through a book to do it? Even <br/>\nif your FIRST book was a collection of prior essays, and nothing <br/>\nelse new, it would be a goldmine to many of us already unschooling, <br/>\nbut it could be even more to someone who hasn&#39;t even considered it <br/>\nyet.---<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I write essays and I move puddles.&quot;<br/>\n Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---You do so much more than that and I, for one, love reading all <br/>\nabout it.
