He just fininshed the 4th Harry Potter book, by the end of it he was in tears and begging to not have to finish it, but the school requires it. In fact they require 3 hrs. a day of reading, outside of school, for points and the only books that count are on this list that the teacher/school has deemed acceptable. It makes me sick. My little bro, a year ago was reading anyhting and everything and now he&#39;s crying because he can&#39;t read Captain Underpants and Choose Your Own Adventures anymore because they arn&#39;t good enough. AAAAAAHHHHHGGGGHHHH!!!!  <br/>\n  Sorry about that, I just get so mad, that his love of books and reading is being squashed and my mom is letting it happen, and she sits here and tells me that it is for his own good and that if I was smart I would put Jaiden and Avery in school because the teachers really want what is best for the kids and they&#39;ll learn so much more, and don&#39;t I wan&#39;t some time for myself?<br/>\n  sick, sick sick, It really makes me sick.<br/>\n  Rebecca<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:genant2@...\">genant2@...</a> wrote:In a message dated 2/24/03 1:39:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shyrley.williams@...\">shyrley.williams@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; .

Or are there lots of early unschooled readers <br/>\ntoo, and we just aren&#39;t hearing those stories?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 3 youngest have always been unschooled. They are 8,7 and 2. For a while <br/>\nwhen the middle ones were almost 5 and 6, they started doing this program I <br/>\nhad leftover from my oldest. It was phonics stuff. They enjoyed it and did <br/>\nit maybe 2-3 times a week. They also loved workbook stuff. Like finding <br/>\nending or beginning sounds to pictures on the sheets. They were going along <br/>\nso well and seemed to enjoy it so much that I thought they would be reading <br/>\nvery soon. This all lasted for about a month and a half. The phonics program <br/>\nwas the first to go. That lasted about 2 weeks. They slowed down a bit on <br/>\nthe worksheets and finally stopped those altogether. They had been doing <br/>\nthem maybe twice a week. When they finished what they had, they said they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to do anymore. At this same time, I was hearing about other <br/>\nunschoolers who had very late readers by school standards. I also had a <br/>\nfriend who&#39;s son wasn&#39;t reading yet at 12 and wasn&#39;t concerned at all. The <br/>\nmore I heard, the more I figured to be ready not to freak if our kids did <br/>\nthe same. I was actually okay with it and asked my husband how he would feel <br/>\nif the kids weren&#39;t reading at the age of 12. He said as long as they could <br/>\nread at 18, he would be okay with it. I knew we&#39;d be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nEver since then, the kids haven&#39;t done one worksheet or book or program. My <br/>\nson and daughter just both turned 8 and 7 and both are reading. My son reads <br/>\na bit faster than my daughter but both do well enough to read like a Boxcar <br/>\nkids book and even the info books they have let alone all the golden books <br/>\nand such they read to the baby. I still read to both of them anyway. They <br/>\nlove for me to read the Boxcar books to them just because it&#39;s more fun to <br/>\nhave me read. And I always do. I can&#39;t say I taught them to read at all. <br/>\nSomewhere along the line they picked it up themselves. I saw it start with <br/>\ntheir Pokemon cards and it went from there. Next was the video games on the <br/>\nplaystation and road signs. I was very ready for them to not be reading. <br/>\nMade sure no relatives made them feel bad about it either. We were very <br/>\nrelaxed around here with them reading or not reading. They have no idea <br/>\nabout when kids &quot;should&quot; be reading either. My kids really don&#39;t get school <br/>\nat all and don&#39;t understand what is expected of them. They have no friends <br/>\nthat go to school. So I think some kids will get it earlier and some will <br/>\nget it later. Same as if they were in school but then again the schools <br/>\ndon&#39;t really give them that chance. My kids are actually reading sooner than <br/>\nI expected.<br/>\n<br/>\nI kind of think about it like potty training. (I hate that term) You can <br/>\nstart a baby early and you can get them to do it. You can coax them a bit <br/>\nand have them either do it or fight back and not do it all. You can leave <br/>\nthem alone and they either do it when they &quot;should&quot; or do it a lot later. 3 <br/>\nof my kids have been in the later category so maybe that&#39;s why I don&#39;t sweat <br/>\nother stuff they &quot;should&quot; know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.

It was my first year HS and I was homeschooling<br/>\nkindergarten.  If I had thought school at home was critical, I would have<br/>\nfailed very quickly.  We had no set schedule, and when I think back on it, I<br/>\nrealize that reading was the one thing I really focused on, because I<br/>\nfigured that the most important thing in kindergarten was learning letter<br/>\nsounds.  (I think differently now, but that is where I was then.)   I had<br/>\nalways read a lot to her, ever since she was an infant.  I also often read<br/>\nto myself while she nursed.  I also talked to her a lot.  I know that isn&#39;t<br/>\nunusual, but one of my parenting things said it is important to talk to<br/>\nbabies, so I would talk about anything just to be saying words aloud to this<br/>\nlittle person who didn&#39;t talk yet.  &quot;Now mommy is putting the plate in the<br/>\ncupboard.&quot;  She was an early talker too, one of those who used complete<br/>\nsentences by age two, so I do think that she is a more verbal person anyway,<br/>\nand that might be one reason why reading came easier to her?  Anyway, she<br/>\nwas reading on her own before I had a chance to teach her much phonics<br/>\nbeyond a few basic consonant and vowel sounds, so she helped me to see that<br/>\nsome kids can learn to read with very little direct instruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I have a point here?  I guess I&#39;m just wondering if the bell curve for<br/>\nreading is much higher than what the schools think.  It seems that schools<br/>\nexpect all kids to read by second grade or age 7 or 8, yet many stories I<br/>\nhear of kids who never had &quot;school&quot; (whether at home or at school) actually<br/>\ndo tend to read much later.
