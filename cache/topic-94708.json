I saw the photos at your website. Very<br/>\n  &gt; inspiring!<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Julie<br/>\n  ====================<br/>\n  Thank you! I love it, and we all enjoy it so much! Dh was skeptical at<br/>\n  first, and more than a bit bummed out by the $$$ spent, though I did all the<br/>\n  labor. But now even he loves it and pouts if we feed the fish before he gets<br/>\n  home. I&#39;ll have to post a picture on my webpage that shows the top and<br/>\n  bottom ponds as a whole to give you the idea of what I was describing. I<br/>\n  deliberately built the upper pond with a gradual slope to it to create a<br/>\n  pebble beach for the kids and wildlife to wade in; it&#39;s only about 18&quot; deep<br/>\n  or so. Of course, the kids&#39; favorite past time is throwing the pebbles into<br/>\n  the ponds, so I&#39;m constantly having to refresh the beach. But it&#39;s worth it!<br/>\n<br/>\n  The ponds are a great source of both enjoyment and learning. The weather<br/>\n  here has been really hot lately, and the kids have been in and out of the<br/>\n  pond multiple times a day. We&#39;ve found tadpoles and black snails, moss and<br/>\n  algae. We test the water weekly for ph and nitrate levels. This weekend, the<br/>\n  kids spotted a snake sunning itself on the rocks--a pretty good size giant<br/>\n  garter snake, we think, either that or an eastern ribbon snake, but I don&#39;t<br/>\n  think so. It was probably hunting for frogs too. We&#39;ve found box turtles and<br/>\n  blue salamanders. Bats and dragonflies love the water. It&#39;s a host to so<br/>\n  much wonderful wildlife. We live a mile in from the Chesapeake Bay, but<br/>\n  we&#39;re very wooded or else we&#39;d probably have herons trying to eat our fish.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I garden because I love to do it, but the kids just gain so much from all of<br/>\n  our gardens and bird feeders and the wildlife they attract. Both dd&#39;s can<br/>\n  differentiate between 4 different woodpeckers that we see, and we&#39;ve been<br/>\n  lucky enough to watch mating dances and &quot;meet&quot; the fledglings when they<br/>\n  first come to our feeders. Julia is amazing at catching butterflies by hand,<br/>\n  and we even hatched a chrysalis this spring that had overwintered in our<br/>\n  shed. The past several days the kids have been out every day picking<br/>\n  strawberries as they ripen, and I&#39;m hoping that this year they&#39;ll enjoy the<br/>\n  blackberries just as much.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, we&#39;re in the process of researching chickens and designing a coop for a<br/>\n  backyard flock of layers. I&#39;ve applied to 4-H to become a leader, largely<br/>\n  due to the recent conversation on this list. I had been looking into scouts,<br/>\n  but wasn&#39;t thrilled with it while 4-H sounds ideal for our family. I also<br/>\n  figure it&#39;s a good way for me to learn about sheep, which I&#39;ve always wanted<br/>\n  to keep. Dh keeps talking about moving, which he knows I&#39;m so reluctant to<br/>\n  do because I&#39;ve put so much time, energy and love into our home. I keep<br/>\n  telling him the only way he&#39;ll get me off this land is to buy me several<br/>\n  acres so I can add sheep, goats and possibly horses to my list!<br/>\n<br/>\n  --Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
