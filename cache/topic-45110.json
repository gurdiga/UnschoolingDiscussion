I don&#39;t believe in spanking. Trying to teach someone not to hit by hitting them is<br/>\n<br/>\npreposterous. I am the younger of two children. I  have an older brother that was resentful of the  <br/>\n<br/>\nattention I got, so I feel a strong connection with Avery.(my brother and I get along fine now.).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I had my second child I just really made sure that my daughter didn&#39;t feel replaced. I brought her<br/>\n<br/>\na baby doll when I brought the baby home. and I also made her feel like her baby brother was her baby  <br/>\n<br/>\ntoo. He was an addition to the family not a replacement. One more person for her to love. I have been  <br/>\n<br/>\nfortunate with all my children in that area. I know we are all individuals,but first and foremost we are<br/>\n<br/>\na family unit.Our motto is all for one and one for all.

Why matters, and stopping the behaviour matters.  It is normally not very conducive to finding out why a behaviour is happening while it is going on since the person is too involved with the actual behaviour to think about it. So it has to stop, and in some cases consequences...loss of the toy, temporarily, may be applied.  But the why helps prevent the behaviour in the future...or at least gives one a leg up in stopping it more quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nbe well,<br/>\nRachel Ann<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, October 03, 2002 9:48 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] needs vs. wants<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 10/3/02 12:06:44 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; Why Jaiden is doing it does not matter  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  It matters hugely!

But the why is important. It is always important. When Kyle (my youngest)<br/>\nwas a couple of months old, every time I would put him on the floor, Jason would<br/>\ncome and throw his whole body on top of Kyle. Could not for the life of me <br/>\nfigure out why. I talked with Jason (who was 3) about it hurting him etc. Did not<br/>\nstop him. I stopped putting Kyle on the floor if I was not around to keep Jason<br/>\noff me. Sometime later, I was watching dh rough house with Jason...by lying on<br/>\ntop of him and having Jason try to get out. Now there is a HUGE difference between<br/>\na 35 yo man gently lying on top of his son while wrestling and a 3 yo lying on<br/>\ntop of a 2 month old, but obviously Jason was too little to understand. Once I made<br/>\nthe connection I was able to approach it from a different direction and Jason <br/>\ngradually understood.
