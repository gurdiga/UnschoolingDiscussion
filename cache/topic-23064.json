It&#39;s certainly not six of one, half dozen<br/>\n&gt; of the other.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There was a good article in Consumer Reports this month, August 2001, on<br/>\n&gt; vaccinations with a great deal more balanced information to draw conclusions<br/>\n&gt; from than websites devoted specifically to convincing people vaccines are<br/>\n&gt; bad (or convincing people vaccines are good for that matter).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think the article was balanced. I looked at it carefully as well as <br/>\nthe web sites mentioned and they were sponsored by people with a financial <br/>\ninterest in the public getting vaccinations. Those web sites were very <br/>\ndefinitely trying to convince me that vaccinations were what I should do. <br/>\nAnytime you bring money/profit into the equation, things get a bit skewed.  . <br/>\n. that&#39;s just the way business is.  I think the book published by Mothering <br/>\nMagazine and some of the articles I have read in there are much more <br/>\nbalanced. One of the articles I read in there (I guess about 2 years ago) had <br/>\na panel of people from various professions concerned with the issue as well <br/>\nas parents (coming from both sides)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd actually we don&#39;t really know how many people&#39;s lives have been saved <br/>\nand/or destroyed on either side. . . it&#39;s a guess on  your part to say that <br/>\nmuch more have been saved.  . . . we really don&#39;t have that information. We <br/>\ndo know that there are casualities on both sides of the issue and that is <br/>\ntruly unfortunate. I have no vested interest in people getting or not getting <br/>\ntheir vaccinations. What I do feel I have an interest in  is in letting <br/>\npeople know they DO have control and that vaccinations ARE NOT mandatory, and <br/>\nthat there are exemptions. I trust that people can make the decision that is <br/>\nbest for their own family when they are been able to get information from all <br/>\nsides of the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are no mistakes, no coincidences.
