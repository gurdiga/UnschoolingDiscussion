I&#39;m glad to hear the experience was so positive for him.  Thanks.  The more I hear and read about it the more I can see why my son wants to be there so much.  It is a place that I feel very good about him living and with his disarming, kind personality I think the Japanese people will really like him.  The trouble is all of us at home will be missing him like crazy!!   I&#39;m almost wanting to move there myself now, but then MY mom would be crying her eyes out!   <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks much,<br/>\nSuzanne<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Kelli Traaseth <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, January 14, 2003 7:50 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] American college grads teaching English to kids in Japan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Suzanne, <br/>\n<br/>\n  This is a bit late,  as I was gone this weekend,  but I have a friend that went to Japan after college.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He was a computer/communications major,  and went over to teach English.    That was about 10 years ago now and he still lives there.      He has really enjoyed it,   loves his life there.        He seems to have really come into his own over there.      He also does alot of photography work and has enjoyed that there also.    <br/>\n<br/>\n  That&#39;s my experience with it!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kelli<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Suzanne Ackerson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sylvanv@...\">sylvanv@...</a>&gt; wrote:Dear Anyone Who Has Experience With the Above Subject,<br/>\n<br/>\n  My 21 year old soon to be college grad (who never went to school till college) is seriously thinking about applying to teach English in Japan to Jr. High and High Schoolers.
