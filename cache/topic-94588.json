He<br/>\nspends time at this guy&#39;s house and is very impressed by him.  As in<br/>\nimpressionable.  A bit of a hero/big brother thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich would be great if this guy would understand that HIS IS NOT THE F&#39;IN<br/>\nPARENT.  We are.  And while he is more than welcome to model behavior he<br/>\nthinks is appropriate and even encourage, he is not supposed to<br/>\n&quot;discipline.&quot;  Ever.  And he tries to do it in front of us sometimes, which<br/>\nwould be hysterical if only....  I mean honestly, even if we weren&#39;t<br/>\nunschooling and trying to be non-coersive and all that, I&#39;d be pretty<br/>\npissed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur son was supposed to spend a couple days at this man&#39;s house.  He came<br/>\nhome because when he refused to take a shower his friend, and I quote,<br/>\n&quot;wouldn&#39;t reward that behavior by letting him play video games.&quot;   Our son,<br/>\nquite resonably, chose to come home rather than deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have asked him for help in the past with giving our son an outlet for<br/>\nthings that are tough with littler sibs around and with over worked parents.<br/>\nWe have asked for his help in our home with the mess we have trouble with<br/>\nbecause of our own habits and having small children.   He has repeatedly<br/>\ninterpreted that as free license to try and parent us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI commented that the 8 year old can be rough with his younger sibs.  It<br/>\nhappens.  I wasn&#39;t asking for advice, I wasn&#39;t doing anything but<br/>\ncommenting.  He asks, &quot;And what consequences are there for doing that?&quot;  In<br/>\nthis amazingly condecending tone like, &quot;And didn&#39;t you do anything about<br/>\nit?&quot;  Who in their right mind talks to a parent that way?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s a good guy, who really genuinely cares about our son.

I mean the whole thing of wondering if you&#39;d do the<br/>\nsame thing to an adult friend really takes on new meaning here.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe does have a younger brother, who he&#39;s sort of parented over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the biggest reason I&#39;m so pissed, really, is the effect on their<br/>\nfriendship.

He <br/>\ncan&#39;t claim you said something you didn&#39;t, if it&#39;s in writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could say that he might never have thought of it in those terms, <br/>\nbut you don&#39;t want your son to be parented or babysat.  You want him to visit, <br/>\nand be treated as a visitor.  You don&#39;t want him punished or rewarded, just <br/>\ntreated like a person.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Anyway, the biggest reason I&#39;m so pissed, really, is the effect on their<br/>\n<br/>\nfriendship.  It means so much to our son, he&#39;s clearly really upset. I think<br/>\n<br/>\nhe&#39;d like to go back over, if not this weekend, then next, as planned.

","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1073251852\">I&#39;m jumping away from the original topic to talk about the basis for <br/>\nfriendships.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; IME, the world is full of well-meaning &#39;good&#39; folks whose motives in <br/>\nbefriending others are sometimes more about &#39;helping&#39; them to see what&#39;s right, and <br/>\nless about genuine friendship.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what most of the homeschooling lists and support groups and playgroups <br/>\nend up being.   Either people are trying to help others or they&#39;re asking for <br/>\nhelp, or they&#39;ve agreed not to discuss much and just let their kids play <br/>\nwithout comparing parenting-belief notes.  And that only lasts until one kid <br/>\nthrows sand in the other one&#39;s faces.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking last week about how people (I have too) disparage school <br/>\nfriendships as being just like having friends in prison, as soon as you&#39;re gone <br/>\nyou&#39;re gone.  But there&#39;s a photo right here of six of my schoolmates, and <br/>\nanother photo of two former best friends of mine, and Holly got to meet them all <br/>\nwhen some of us got together at the request of one who&#39;s been living in <br/>\nWashington for years and wanted to see us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like those people.  Some I&#39;ve kept in contact with.  ALL of them, <br/>\nI&#39;ve been thrilled if I ran into them, but they&#39;re all in Santa Fe and points <br/>\nnorth, and I&#39;m in Albuquerque &quot;lately&quot; (for the past 24 years or so).   Some of <br/>\nthem I&#39;ve known since I was seven.  We WERE friends outside of school, and <br/>\nknew each others&#39; families and dogs and cousins.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some homeschoolers I&#39;m friends with in and as it concerns <br/>\nhomeschooling.  Sometimes when one stops homeschooling, the relationship fades quickly. <br/>\n Partly, sometimes, it&#39;s because they don&#39;t want to be reminded of what they <br/>\ndecided against, or they want their kids to bond with the school friends now <br/>\nand not look back.  Sometimes it&#39;s just I don&#39;t really care about the details <br/>\nof their lives if their kids are no longer going to be at my house every week <br/>\nor two or they are going to be talking about school a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there are relationships built on homeschooling as a mutual &quot;place.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut in the real world of random relationships with neighbors and friends&#39; <br/>\nfriends and former co-workers and all that, sometimes there ARE close and <br/>\nlongterm friendships based on something between the two individuals at an intangible <br/>\nlevel.    Sometimes it&#39;s entirely mutual.   Many more friendships, though, in <br/>\nmy experience, are based on need and exchange of services, ideas, assistance, <br/>\nsympathy, attention, in a more temporary way.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby has some anime friends.  What they have in common is an interest in <br/>\nanime and a shared set of experiences and adventures at Lobo Comics here, and Nan <br/>\nDesu Con in Denver every year.    With some, he has done other things at <br/>\nother times.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby and Marty have lots of gaming friends.  If one of them decided gaming <br/>\nwas stupid and a waste of time and energy, the friendship would probably fade <br/>\npretty quickly and without animosity.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] So pissed off right now","postDate":"1085412006","msgId":94597,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwQjIxMkE2LjcwNDA3MDJAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDBhYzUwMWM0NTliMyRmNzVhYWYzMCRmZDAwYThjMEBKZW5ueT4=","referencesHeader":"PDBhYzUwMWM0NTliMyRmNzVhYWYzMCRmZDAwYThjMEBKZW5ueT4="},"prevInTopic":94596,"nextInTopic":94598,"prevInTime":94596,"nextInTime":94598,"topicId":94588,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** He s a good guy, who really genuinely cares about our son.

We are.  And while he is more than welcome to model behavior he thinks is appropriate and even encourage, he is not supposed to &quot;discipline.&quot;  Ever.  And he tries to do it in front of us sometimes, which would be hysterical if only.. ..  I mean honestly, even if we weren&#39;t unschooling and trying to be non-coersive and all that, I&#39;d be pretty pissed.<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like this has been a problem before.  How have you addressed it then, or did you just let slide? Does this friend know how you feel about discipline?  <br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nOur son was supposed to spend a couple days at this man&#39;s house.  He camehome because when he refused to take a shower his friend, and I quote, &quot;wouldn&#39;t reward that behavior by letting him play video games.&quot;   Our son,quite resonably, chose to come home rather than deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\nokay, again I don&#39;t know this guy or your son, but... A man who is not your 8yo son&#39;s father insisted your son take a shower.  Personally, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be comfortable -- no, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d be very uncomfortable -- with this scenario.  Something about it just feels inappropriate, especially if your son didn&#39;t feel comfortable showering at this friend&#39;s home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI will admit that my &#39;weird&#39; radar is easily set-off (several incidences of child molestation in my extended family) but for me it&#39;s a big, red flag when an man without kids of his own takes a personal interest in a young boy. <br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\nWe have asked him for help in the past with giving our son an outlet for things that are tough with littler sibs around and with over worked parents. We have asked for his help in our home with the mess we have trouble with because of our own habits and having small children.   He has repeatedly interpreted that as free license to try and parent us.<br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, sure he has!  You&#39;re talking about a guy who &#39;helped&#39; raise his younger sibling.  You&#39;ve asked him for &#39;help&#39; with your bad habits and mess.  I can understand where he got the impression you are immature, incapable parents who need his guidance.  He probably feels like he&#39;s doing your son a favor, given the lack of direction it appears he gets at home (I&#39;m not saying I think it&#39;s lack of discipline, just that I can see where he would think that).  <br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\nI commented that the 8 year old can be rough with his younger sibs.  It happens.  I wasn&#39;t asking for advice, I wasn&#39;t doing anything but commenting.  He asks, &quot;And what consequences are there for doing that?&quot;  In this amazingly condecending tone like, &quot;And didn&#39;t you do anything about it?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you told him what your method is, or just left him to believe you are &#39;doing nothing&#39; about discipline? It sounds to me like the friend believes you should be &quot;doing more.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nWho in their right mind talks to a parent that way?<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone who thinks you are a negligent parent, in need of his guidance. Again, have you told him how you feel?  If not, is it because you&#39;re concerned you might lose him as a support system? Of course, the next question should be whether he is the kind of support system you want?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\nHe&#39;s a good guy, who really genuinely cares about our son.  I don&#39;t doubt that for a moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\nIME, the world is full of well-meaning &#39;good&#39; folks whose motives in befriending others are sometimes more about &#39;helping&#39; them to see what&#39;s right, and less about genuine friendship.  I would really look closely at whether or not this guy is being a good support system for you and what his opinion of your parenting says to your son.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were my kid, I&#39;d be seeing red flags all over this situation, and probably find some way to limit his influence.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSyl <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
