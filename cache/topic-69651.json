They <br/>\nwere superstars of the school - everybody loved them, they were given <br/>\nspecial privileges just because they were successful and popular. Roya <br/>\nwas in the gifted program and Rox was in a wonderful class of kids from <br/>\n4 to 8 years old. There were no tests in this school - no textbooks - <br/>\nno grades. It was a public school - but very innovative (I&#39;d done a lot <br/>\nof legwork to get them a transfer to that particular school). They used <br/>\n&quot;authentic assessment&quot; and a lot of learning centers - little <br/>\nwhole-group teaching. Lots of music and art - really high quality. <br/>\nCouldn&#39;t ask for better public school situation. I was PTA treasurer - <br/>\na job that required that I work pretty closely with the school <br/>\nprincipal, so we were friends and I took advantage of that to make sure <br/>\nmy kids got the best teachers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took them out because I got AOL, was interested in education, ended <br/>\nup on the homeschooling forums - met Sandra and others there - and <br/>\ncaught the unschooling fever. Roxana was happy about the idea, but Roya <br/>\nwanted to stay in school. I had to promise her we&#39;d reconsider after 6 <br/>\nweeks. I took the kids to the beach almost every day for the first <br/>\nthree weeks - and they quickly got involved with a very active <br/>\nhomeschooling group. She never wanted to go back and they both thank me <br/>\nalmost every single day for discovering unschooling!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Saturday, May 17, 2003, at 05:02 PM, Paula Sjogerman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt; With over 1000 members on this list is there no one????? who has taken<br/>\n&gt;&gt; their young kids out of public school   when there was no real <br/>\n&gt;&gt; issues-(ie,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; bad schools-learning difficulties-reluctance to go-bullying)  other <br/>\n&gt;&gt; than the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; conviction that  realxed home schooling ar unschooling was a very <br/>\n&gt;&gt; positive<br/>\n&gt;&gt; thing?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pam Sorooshian, where are you?
