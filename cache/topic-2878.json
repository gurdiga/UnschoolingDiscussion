I would build unit studies based<br/>\non their interests, and come up with activities and<br/>\nbooks to read and field trips.  And I could not<br/>\nbelieve that math could be truly unschooled, so they<br/>\ndid have math workbooks they had to do.  But if anyone<br/>\nasked, I was an unschooler, especially compared to my<br/>\nschool-at-home friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now unschooling means something much deeper to me,<br/>\nand has allowed my religion to go to a deeper place as<br/>\nwell.  Now it is all fused into the whole of my life. <br/>\nMy children are a part of it, and so they absorb it as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t make them read their bibles or pray or go to<br/>\nSunday School, or even go to church if they don&#39;t want<br/>\nto.  But they see me doing these things, and hopefully<br/>\nwith sincerity and not out of a sense of duty, so ask<br/>\nquestions and we talk about it.  The older two have<br/>\nboth gone in spurts where they will read their bibles<br/>\nor offer to pray for someone who is ill or sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe older two usually want to go to church for the<br/>\nsocial atmosphere where they can hang with their<br/>\nfriends, and the 5yo does have to go when we all go,<br/>\nbut he takes his toys or books and if he chooses I<br/>\nstay out in the hallway with him where he can play<br/>\ninstead of go to class.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took a lot of time to get to this place though. <br/>\nProbably can go a lot farther, and will, by the end of<br/>\nmy lifetime.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\nwifetovegman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew Yahoo!

I have been delighted with this personal observation! <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Same here.  I view my relationship with God to be the perfect example of the <br/>\nunschooling ideals.  It&#39;s all about inspiration, freedom to explore, internal <br/>\nmotivation and ethics which are part of everything I do.  As a Christian I&#39;m <br/>\nnot bound by the status quo but to an eventual higher calling.  Isn&#39;t that <br/>\nwhat we are trying to help our kids to find by unschooling them?<br/>\n<br/>\nLouisaM</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Natrlmama@xxx.xxx","from":"Natrlmama@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ij2xe-pkvyd6wO9ORWomGQeh6ie83C8Q6VsOtfEMtUssBjXG1ZN5yHiQB-QXwLZKDeAmfGwY8eE","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re:unschooling and religion","postDate":"937016180","msgId":2878,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMDEuMjg3OC45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2880,"prevInTime":2877,"nextInTime":2879,"topicId":2878,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 09/08/1999 8:42:35 PM Pacific Daylight Time, jhawthorne@home.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1449121438\">In a message dated 09/08/1999 8:42:35 PM Pacific Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhawthorne@...\">jhawthorne@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; <br/>\n It crosses my mind that there are many religious faiths in which submission <br/>\nto<br/>\n authority is a basic tenet of faith.

I have done no formal learning<br/>\nwith my dd (6) and she has a strong faith and a prayer life outside the one<br/>\nthat we share together.
