Often it is a dividing point of support groups in <br/>\n&gt; an area. One group will be open to any, all, and no religions and the other <br/>\n&gt; only Christian folks. I find it hard to grasp how you could feel <br/>\n&gt; comfortable in both.

Slowly, slowly, slowly I&#39;m finding my niche.  Starting <br/>\nover in a new group and new area is requiring far more patience than I had <br/>\nanticipated.  The good thing is my patience has paid off and I&#39;m feeling far <br/>\nmore supported than I had in my 7 months here. We met at a playland, just 4 <br/>\nmoms and our 6 kids among us ~ ate pizza and talked about all the <br/>\ngrownup-homeschooling-chick-stuff, for HOURS :):):)  We&#39;ve had a big turnover <br/>\nin the original *inclusive* group and we&#39;re still learning and determining <br/>\nwho we are *now*.  I&#39;m surrounded by hordes of *exclusive* support groups.  <br/>\nI&#39;m saddened by their behavior and I find them not at all Christ-like.  As <br/>\nmuch as I know I am in a deeply spiritual, sacred area, I am reminded that <br/>\nthe roots here are deeply secured in the Bible Belt.  Now that I have <br/>\nmaintained myself, my belief systems, a true representation of diana in the <br/>\nface of their intolerance, a few have to look at me as the Heathen they <br/>\nreally like :) which, of course, is fine with me!

It&#39;s just &quot;where do you all go to church?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  It probably *is* just someone looking for common ground.  In some <br/>\n  communities in Michigan, asking&#39;s as common as breathing and it seems that <br/>\n  everyone knows where everyone else goes to church!  I still find it <br/>\n  invasive sometimes, because of the assumptions it makes (#1 being that <br/>\n  everyone believes in their deity.)  Sometimes church-goin&#39;-folk don&#39;t get <br/>\n  that perfectly nice people don&#39;t go to church or are (gasp) atheist or <br/>\n  etc.  It&#39;s really and truly outside their comprehension.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Speaking of which:  My sister-in-law, during the rehearsal for their <br/>\n  wedding asked me where I go to church.  I laughed and said &quot;Oh, honey. I&#39;m <br/>\n  atheist!&quot;  Stunned her completely.  All she could say was Really? (about 5 <br/>\n  times) and &quot;You&#39;re so nice!&quot;  I told her she&#39;s actually surrounded by <br/>\n  atheists in her everyday life and most of us are pretty nice, but I think <br/>\n  she was still dealing with the juxtaposition of me, atheism and <br/>\n  niceness.  She still looks at me funny sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n  For the door-knockers, I say my goddess is the one that gave birth to their <br/>\n  god and, by the way, She wants to know why he hasn&#39;t returned Her <br/>\n  calls!  It&#39;s very rude and that&#39;s not the way she raised him up. (or some <br/>\n  other nagging-mother-stereotype phrase)  They usually don&#39;t know why, and <br/>\n  generally leave.<br/>\n  If I just don&#39;t want to deal, I say Global Congregationalist.

When people proselytize at me, I usually<br/>\njust say, &quot;I&#39;m happy with my own religion, thank you.&quot;  Religion is<br/>\nsomething about which almost everyone has an opinion, and we all think<br/>\nwe&#39;re right (I mean, in a country with so many religions, if we thought<br/>\nour own was wrong, we&#39;d convert to the religion - or non-religion - we<br/>\nthought was right).  So arguing about it is pointless; it&#39;s only going<br/>\nto result in hurt feelings all around.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son had surgery in January and a really sweet nursing assistant was<br/>\nplaying with him and asked if he went to school.  I just said &quot;no&quot;<br/>\nbecause he&#39;s still a bit under compulsory age, but my husband<br/>\nvolunteered the fact that we&#39;re homeschoolers.  Well, she must have<br/>\nthought that meant we shared her religious beliefs, because she started<br/>\ntalking about how she&#39;d homeschool too if she had kids and then she gave<br/>\nmy son a book about Jesus.  I didn&#39;t say anything to her because it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t the time or place to discuss our religious beliefs, but my<br/>\nhusband and I were very uncomfortable.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBefore my son had his surgery (he had a tumor on his neck that was very<br/>\nnoticeable) we were traveling in the south and two women came over to us<br/>\nin a fried chicken place and started telling us we needed to anoint him<br/>\nwith sweet oil and bless him in the name of Jesus so his tumor would go<br/>\naway.  One of them even pulled out a bottle of oil from her purse and<br/>\nshoved it into my hand.  She asked if I knew Jesus, and I just said,<br/>\n&quot;Yes&quot; because 1. I grew up Christian, so it&#39;s not really a lie, and 2. I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to hear whatever speech she gives people who say &quot;no&quot;.  My<br/>\nhusband was completely freaked out by these women, but I grew up<br/>\nPentecostal, and I knew they were just trying to be nice.<br/>\n <br/>\nSorcha<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132394532,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day!","from":"Have a Nice Day! &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"litlrooh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] &quot;what church&quot;?","postDate":"1047059597","msgId":60301,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmEwMWMyZTRkMiQ2ZWU5M2VjMCQ3YjdlNTI0NEBjZWxlcm9uMTc+","referencesHeader":"PDFhMi4xMTlhNmNiMC4yYjlhMzRjOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60300,"nextInTopic":60302,"prevInTime":60300,"nextInTime":60302,"topicId":60283,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh, I understand that its usually for a topic of conversation etc, but this was different.

She wants to get together with them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI saw her again tonight and we were supposed to discuss when they could get together.  She didni&#39;t bring her calendar.  We did talk a little bit though and she readily admits she is in no hurry to do this.  (But she is also in no hurry to pursue the gymnastics either...(she told me that too).  <br/>\n<br/>\nOut of the clear blue sky, she asked me &quot;If you don&#39;t mind my asking, what church you attend?&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n(sigh).  Even when I was a devout fundamentalist Christian, strangers never asked me that question.  Obviously that is a priority for her and given her cautious nature, I&#39;m beginning to draw some conclusions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ironic thing about this is that I *was* considering attending a church just because I miss the fellowship, but that would not make me a Christian.  And yet, if I had said &quot;I attend such and such church&quot; she would have felt much more sure of me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she started talking about how the gymnasium that our daughters attend does not do child abuse checks on the adults that work there.  It was something I hadn&#39;t thought much about.  I&#39;m there when my girls are in gymnastics so I see everything that goes on, and my youngest does have a male coach.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat bothers me though is that she said she thinks she is going to push for the gymnasium to do background checks on everyone who works there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still getting to know her so I don&#39;t want to jump to any conclusions.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe silver lining in all of this is that I can honestly say that  I&#39;m totally happy with how we live and I don&#39;t feel the need to apologize or defend it.  If someone is uncomfortable with us, thats just ok with me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess only time will tell how things progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60671,"nextTopicId":60177}}
