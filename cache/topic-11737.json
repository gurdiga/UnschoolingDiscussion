I laminated it and took it <br/>\nto a homeschooling conference and showed it around, mostly for the invented <br/>\nspellings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day, in December, she asked me what a book report is really like.  <br/>\nI told her, and she kinda nodded and shrugged and went away.   Then last week <br/>\nwe had rented a South Park DVD and one of the shows (Chicken Lover) had book <br/>\nreports!!  AND they were on books she had read, which made it a scream.  <br/>\n<br/>\nChicken Lover involves the police chief being discovered to be illiterate.  <br/>\nThe young hippie bookmobile driver is trying to get him to read (it&#39;s a <br/>\ntypical South Park story, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend anyone reading it just <br/>\nabout book reports!).  He ends up going to third grade and being in the boys&#39; <br/>\nclass.  Cartman is going to report on The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, <br/>\nso when the teachers says he hasn&#39;t read it, Cartman makes up some cool <br/>\nnonsense which really amused Holly because she knows the books.   Then the <br/>\npolice guy reported on Go Dog, Go and went into deep meanings, and read a <br/>\npassage.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe next night we were at Walmart, and Go Dog, Go was offered as a freebie if <br/>\nyou bought two books (or some such thing), so Holly picked it up and said &quot;Is <br/>\nthis the book?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the punchline of that new literacy and reading is the bookmobile guy <br/>\ngives the police guy a copy of Atlas Shrugged as a gift for his having <br/>\nlearned to read.  So at a ceremony at which he&#39;s reinstated in his job and <br/>\nhonored for learning to read, he says he read Atlas Shrugged and it was <br/>\nterrible so he&#39;s never going to read a book ever again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would tell your daughter that every book or movie review is a report, but a <br/>\nREAL report, for other people to read.  Every summary in Newsweek that has a <br/>\ngraph or a chart is a report, but not a pretend report, like kids write in <br/>\nschool, that are read by one person and thrown away.

We have always homeschooled. We started out quite <br/>\nstructured and have been loosing up more and more each year. I first heard of <br/>\nunschooling when we went online a few years ago. Now I consider us to be <br/>\napart of this wonderful lifestyle. The kids do use Math-u-See math books but <br/>\nit is their choice and I do not require it. Matter of fact my 10 year old <br/>\nsaid he does not want to do it for a while and that is ok. We also read aloud <br/>\ntogether almost daily and enjoy it very much. Right now we all have an <br/>\ninterest in ancient history, so that is what we have been reading. Boy I have <br/>\nlearned a lot. It is so interesting. (But we did take a break to read the <br/>\nnewest Harry Potter book recently!) The kids came to me yesterday telling me <br/>\nsomethings they would like to check out. The oldest saw the book Blueprints <br/>\nfor Geometry in a catalog and wants to try it. The 14 yr. old wants to learn <br/>\nJapanese, an interest that stems from the Japanese terms they use in karate. <br/>\nAll the sudden this summer all the kids have gotten excited about playing the <br/>\nsax and clarinet we have here. The boys found art and science books they want <br/>\nto try.  And this is pretty much how it goes. We live in the country on a few <br/>\nacres. We live pretty simply except for this pc which has become a necessity. <br/>\nWe do love the internet! :)<br/>\n    My husband works a lot of hours in the summer for a construction company <br/>\nbut winter is coming. The kids and I earn money selling items on ebay. And <br/>\nthe kids clean a house for a neighbor to pay for karate classes. The kids <br/>\nalso race BMX. Seems like we are seldom bored.<br/>\n    I look forward to meeting you all<br/>\nCandy<br/>\n&quot;I never let schoolin interfer with my education&quot;<br/>\nMark Twain</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53616,"nextTopicId":53645}}
