I know the grass looks <br/>\n  greener on the other side and no I dont want to be them but it all does way <br/>\n  heavy on my heart.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, I have an SUV (so scary to admit here :0)), that we bought used, for<br/>\n  cash.  I count what is in my cart before it goes in my cart.  Really, before<br/>\n  I go into the store.  We have no debt, aside from our mortgage - no credit<br/>\n  cards, no other loans.  We live below our means, on a budget. We don&#39;t<br/>\n  consider shopping a pastime.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  It was not always this way.  I&#39;ve been on the buybuybuy treadmill, I<br/>\n  remember the nagging guilty feelings at the cash register, the night-time<br/>\n  worrying, and the thrill of finding a &#39;bargain&#39; on some unnecessary item<br/>\n  that I just had to have.  When we decided that something had to change, we<br/>\n  just stopped shopping.  That simple.  We throw away catalogs without looking<br/>\n  at them.  We came up with a yearly budget.  We agreed never to have another<br/>\n  credit card.  We only go to a store when there is something we NEED.<br/>\n  Thinking about what a need is made a huge difference for us.  We started<br/>\n  putting any money we could find into savings - even if it was .02.  If the<br/>\n  electric budget was $50, and the bill was $48.50, $1.50 went into savings.<br/>\n  We couldn&#39;t believe how quickly those small amounts added up.  We do buy<br/>\n  things that we want, but not on impulse, and not without making sure we can<br/>\n  spare the money first.  Our whole perspective has changed.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  We are by no means wealthy, and Jon had been laid off for over a year, but<br/>\n  we are in control of what money we do have.  I don&#39;t think it matters how<br/>\n  much you make (I&#39;m not talking about truly impoverished families) - anyone<br/>\n  can make a budget and stick to it if they decide to.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  We&#39;re all responsible for our own grass.  If it doesn&#39;t look green enough,<br/>\n  we&#39;re the only ones who can change it.  The same way we can be at peace in<br/>\n  our families because of the choices we make, we can be at peace with our<br/>\n  money because of the choices we make.  ~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
