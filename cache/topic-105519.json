Your focus would be on having a <br/>\ngood life together, feeling accepted and good about themselves, <br/>\nenjoying what they spend their time doing, exploring more of the world <br/>\nthan they&#39;ve been exposed to, perhaps. You never know what might spark <br/>\nan interest - it could be dog training or cake decorating. WHEN they <br/>\nhave healed and filled their needs for family and love and safety and <br/>\ngood health and they truly feel supported and cared for - when you all <br/>\nare having a GOOD time together, living a life of joy - then they will <br/>\ndevelop interests and passions for learning. If you continue to force <br/>\nit now, they&#39;ll always think of learning as something they were coerced <br/>\ninto doing and something they can be &quot;free&quot; of doing - something they <br/>\ncan &#39;escape from.&#39; Sad way to think of learning.
