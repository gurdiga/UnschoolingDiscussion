Before that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-582509458\">Hi: I am a few-months-new member of this list. I&#39;ve been homeschooling my<br/>\ndaughters, who are almost-eight and ten years old for about 1.5 years.<br/>\nBefore that they were in public school, bored and unhappy. I&#39;ve never posted<br/>\non this list before, but always enjoy reading it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m writing to ask if any of you have read a book titled Ida B by Katherine<br/>\nHannigan, and if so, what you thought. I read the book because my older dd<br/>\nand I are in a mother-daughter book discussion group run by our public<br/>\nlibrary, and it is this month&#39;s book. We are the only homeschoolers in the<br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main character, Ida B, is homeschooled and then has to return to public<br/>\nschool when her mother becomes ill with cancer. Most of the story deals with<br/>\nher adjusting to returning to public school.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter loves Ida B. She&#39;s getting a lot of mileage out of finding a<br/>\nbook featuring a child who is homeschooled and who is very imaginative. I<br/>\nread it and was irritated. I&#39;m still trying to discern exactly why I feel so<br/>\ngrumpy whenever I think about the book. The titles it reminds us of are the<br/>\nJunie B Jones books (which we love!) and Because of Winn Dixie.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the lone homeschoolers, I&#39;m also anticipating being put on the spot and<br/>\nam trying to think ahead. I&#39;ve known the other book discussion group members<br/>\nfor a few years (we live in a small town) and they are a friendly bunch. I&#39;m<br/>\nnot expecting hostile questions, just uninformed ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes, Cara B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112657,"nextTopicId":112731}}
