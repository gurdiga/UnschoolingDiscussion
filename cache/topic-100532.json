It started about the time he discovered modeling<br/>\nclay and people around us suggested he was having a reaction to some<br/>\ningredient in the clay.  The dye was the chief suspect.  I talked to<br/>\nDylan and mentioned the idea the clay might be causing his rash and he<br/>\nsaid he&#39;d rather have the rash then give up the clay. <br/>\n<br/>\nHis rash would come and go and he was often playing with clay, getting<br/>\nmore and different types.   <br/>\nWe tried different clays from art supply stores but he really liked the<br/>\ncolored clays.  Relatives and friends kept offering advice and my sister<br/>\nin law said more than once &quot;If he was my child that&#39;d be the end of that<br/>\nclay!&quot; <br/>\n  <br/>\nHe would lay a vinyl table cloth on the floor and sit and work on clay. <br/>\nSometimes he&#39;d stand up and mash it with his little bare feet.  He had<br/>\nrash on his feet too, so more and more it seemed like the clay, but Dylan<br/>\nwas absolutely willing to trade out the fun and fulfillment of clay for<br/>\nthe sometimes discomfort of the rash.   (He makes wonderful dinosaurs and<br/>\nmonsters and is very interested in claymation animation style movies.) <br/>\n<br/>\nWe visited a doctor who said &quot;contact dermatitis.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t take the clay away from him.   <br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward to this spring, his rash got quite bad and he decided he&#39;d<br/>\nlike to see a doctor to see if there was a cream or something he could<br/>\nuse.  We had tried different over the counter stuff and some things<br/>\nseemed to help for a little while but the rash would return.  He was  in<br/>\nmartial arts and though he could wear Tae Kwon Do shoes which covered the<br/>\nrash on his feet he was getting comments from kids in class about the<br/>\nrash on his palms.  It was bad, splitting and thick skinned and itchy. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to a dermatologist who took one look and said it was psoriasis.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about that? <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan believed me when I said it was probably clay, but he made the<br/>\nchoice to continue to work with it.<br/>\nI could have fought with him, taken away the clay and made him miserable<br/>\nfor how many weeks or months before we discovered it wasn&#39;t clay at all.<br/>\nI could have remained convinced it was some kind of contact dermatitis<br/>\nand started eliminating other things he loved.   I could have decided it<br/>\nwas an allergy and made him give up his favorite things. <br/>\n<br/>\nLittle side note here;  He quit eating peppers and tomatoes and potatoes<br/>\nabout the time his rash appeared and a couple things that sometimes<br/>\nexacerbate psoriasis for some people are peppers, tomatoes and potatoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids know more about what they need and don&#39;t need than most people ever<br/>\nconsider.

There was a soda machine which had various <br/>\nkinds of soda and also water bottles.  One boy (age 10) had a bunch <br/>\nof change in his pocket but but needed a little more from his mom to <br/>\nhave enough for a drink.  He then came back with a Mountain Dew.  <br/>\nHis mom saw, said &quot;absolutely not&quot; and took the Mountain Dew away, <br/>\nputting it under her legs.  She said &quot;I thought you were getting <br/>\nwater!&quot; to which he replied &quot;I pushed the water button but Mountain <br/>\nDew came out.&quot;  She wouldn&#39;t let him drink it, so he immediately <br/>\ndeferred to her and skated away without the slightest complaint or <br/>\neven a tiny attempt at negotiation.<br/>\nI was completely amazed, and said so. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy oldest son would have protested *loudly* if I had taken control <br/>\nof him in that way, as he has since he was a toddler.  He has a very <br/>\nstrong voice.  Even my second son, who&#39;s much &quot;easier&quot; (goes along <br/>\nwith his father and I without argument) would have *at least* <br/>\nattempted to negotiate.  This boy- nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ensuing conversation ended up with the moms agreeing it was a <br/>\npersonality thing.  Which led me to think... isn&#39;t it worrisome for <br/>\na child to obey so unquestionably?  To go against his own wishes and <br/>\ndesires *so* automatically without even thinking of asserting his <br/>\nown voice?  I&#39;m glad my children think for themselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPatti</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Digest Number 4985","postDate":"1097323541","msgId":100542,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJEOEQ0QzU0LjJENzY0JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDA4MTkxNjA4LjI3NTkxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjYwNDAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":100532,"nextInTopic":100545,"prevInTime":100541,"nextInTime":100543,"topicId":100532,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

However, I am trying to be factual, as well. When my children are/were small, they didn&#39;t get much choice, it is true. I boycott Nestle, I don&#39;t spend my money on Nestle, and so they didn&#39;t get Nestle, either, as long as they wre dependent on me to get it. If my two year old picks up a Butterfinger at the grocery store, I say that mommy doesn&#39;t like to buy that kind, and point to a nice Hershey something next to it. So far, so good with that one.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen they got Nestle trick or treating I didn&#39;t make them throw it out. If they got a Disney video as a gift, they could keep it and watch it. When they got older and had spending money, they could choose to buy Nestle with it. For most of my children, most of the time, by the time they had their own money they didn&#39;t choose to buy it.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe Nestle boycott has been going on since about 1980. I don&#39;t see that my refusing to buy Nestle for the last 20+ years has had much of an effect on them, it&#39;s true. However, for me it&#39;s about *me*, about personal integrity. No, it won&#39;t matter to Nestle if I only boycott them 98% of the time. It does matter to me. It also matters to me that I model my consistenty in standing up for the things I believe. It does, however, keep me from going off the deep end if someone else gives my kids a Crunch bar. <br/>\n <br/>\nI boycotted Nestle before I had any children. My husband, my oldest daughter and I decided to boycott Disney several years ago, when the others were too young to voice an opinion. Other things that have come up since then we have discussed and decided as a family. Things that only *I* personally won&#39;t buy, like McDonald&#39;s, I don&#39;t refer to as a family boycott. Things that we all decided not to buy, like Nestle, I consider the family to be boycotting, even if some members of the family aren&#39;t as strict about it as others. Since we all made the decision, and since everyone abides by it most of the time, I consider the family to be boycotting. <br/>\n <br/>\nThere are a few things that we all originally decided on that later on one or more of the  kids decided they didn&#39;t agree with any longer. In those cases, I also don&#39;t say that the family boycotts those things (or whatever) but if it came up I might say that I or my husband or my oldest daughter or whoever does.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome things I don&#39;t feel that strongly about, but if I care enough to research something, talk it over with my family, and decide to not support it, then I&#39;m going to act on my decision. If I didn&#39;t particularly care for Nestle, but I was willing to buy it now and again, I wouldn&#39;t say I boycott them.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor the sake of accuracy, however, I still have to say that I feel most of these things started out as top down decisions. My two year old doesn&#39;t get Nestle, even though he can have candy. I expect it to be several years before he has the financial ability to honestly decide for himself  whether he wants to boycott Nestle or not. In the meantime, I am going to continue to say that I don&#39;t want to spend my money on that particular thing, and would he like a Reese&#39;s cup instead. FWIW, I have bought him food at McDonald&#39;s, even though I won&#39;t eat there, because I buy it occasionaly for others in the family who have decided that they don&#39;t boycott McDonald&#39;s.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, and I waited a while to give my kids the dead babies version of Nestle. For years I simply said that Mommy didn&#39;t like to buy nestle products. I think my middle girls were about 11 and 12 before I went through the whoole nine yards with them, because they asked. However, I will talk about what I don&#39;t like about Disney to even the two year old sometimes. Depends on the situation.<br/>\n <br/>\nAriella<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!

Each child decided as he or she was <br/>\nschool-age.  And they&#39;re all home at 12, 15 and 18.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nWell, I consider ours top down. We started homeschooling. As they got older they could, of course, choose whether to continue, or whether to go about their education in some other way. However, when they were 5, I didn&#39;t send them to school, we unschooled. To me, that shows a certain bias. :-) Of the 5, one unschooled completely, two have gone to school in high school, one still unschools and one is just 2; <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Living where we live wasn&#39;t top down either.  We asked all the kids <br/>\nwhat they would like in a house and we made a list and looked.  Holly and Kirby <br/>\nwere disappointed at first because Kirby doesn&#39;t like change, and Holly had <br/>\nliked another house we almost had but lost.  They&#39;re happy now, though.  She <br/>\nhas changed rooms three times (four rooms have been &quot;her room&quot; in six <br/>\nyears).  The last change was because she wanted more shelves, so she talked me out of my office upstairs. &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nAgain, I guess I don&#39;t see that as not top down for us. My husband and I choose the state we live in before the children came along. We have discussed moving, we have family in two different states and none here. We haven&#39;t moved because the kids don&#39;t want to. They have friends here, the two in high school like the school they attend, etc. However, had we started out in a different state, then they probably would have chosen to stay there. My oldest did choose to move closer to family in another state when she was 19, and lived there for almost 5 years, although she is back home with us now.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I think philosophy is more important than politics.  Politics has to do <br/>\nwith interpersonals.  Philosophy is internal to the person.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI think they are both important, and philosophy is probably more important to me. I feel that many of my beliefs and values are based on my personal philosophy of life. Homeschooling/unschooling fit right in with my earthy crunchy parenting philosophy, and that&#39;s why we started out that way.However, for us, at least, homeschooling and unschooling were political as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n-- think they have a right to &quot;know&quot; my husband and I as we are, not <br/>\nas a facade we put on for their benefit.--<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;This suggests (perhaps unintentionally) that others here are putting on <br/>\na facade.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was not my intent to suggest that others are putting on a facade. I apologize if it came across that way. What I tried to say was that for us, putting our beliefs aside to let the children buy/have/do what they wanted would seem to be a false relationship. I *do* care about what products/people/companies we support and do not support. I would have to put that aside and pretend that I did not. We chose to focus on explaining what we liked and disliked about things, and emphasize that everyone gets to choose for themselves what is important, and what actions they want to take supporting those. <br/>\n <br/>\nFor my family, as I said, that seems to have worked, because they have shown that they will make decisions independently of their father and I. They can even hold their own in heated discussions about our differences. Sometimes I&#39;ve been the one to re-think a position, or change my mind. Sometimes none of changes anything, but we certainly understand each other&#39;s positions.<br/>\n <br/>\nAriella<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
