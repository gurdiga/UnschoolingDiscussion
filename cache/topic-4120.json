I was so glad to read your post.  I&#39;m pretty much a lurker on this <br/>\nand other unschooling lists, but I had to chime in here.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour life seems to have many parallels to mine.  I have six children: four of <br/>\nthem boys, and two close to ages of yours.  We, too, as a family, converted <br/>\nto Catholicism five years ago.  My children, too, spent a semester at a <br/>\nparochial school and I ended up taking them out.  I also had a Kindergarten <br/>\nstudent at the time who loved it, but we chose to take him out too, probably <br/>\nmore out of convenience than anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have AGONIZED over my choices again and again.  I love the philosophy of <br/>\nunschooling, and yet I have never been truly able to &quot;let go&quot; with my kids <br/>\nthe way I want to.  Sometimes I think it&#39;s just having so many children and <br/>\nso much going on at one time that makes it hard.  But, I know it&#39;s also my <br/>\nown &quot;institutionalization.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another unschooling list recently, someone expressed impatience for people <br/>\nwho seem to have h/s&#39;ed for a long time, but still can&#39;t make up their minds <br/>\nabout which way to go.  It wasn&#39;t directed at me, but it made me feel <br/>\nterrible, because I fall into that category.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like indecisiveness, but I agree with you, that sometimes we have to <br/>\ntry out different options in order to be stronger about what we do <br/>\nbelieve...to add definition.  I know that after my children&#39;s experience in <br/>\nparochial school, I was much stronger about my homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there.

She finally gave up after a few weeks of my resistance,<br/>\nbut as a parent it blows my mind that she could be so calously insensitive<br/>\nto my feelings, which I made abundantly clear.  She thought that because my<br/>\nolder sisters (my father&#39;s ex-wife&#39;s girls) all attended ballet when they<br/>\nwere little, that I should too.  I believe now that it had a lot to do with<br/>\nher efforts to &quot;look good&quot; in comparison to this first wife.  It never<br/>\nceases to amaze me how selfishly motivated my mother can be, even when<br/>\ndoing something &quot;for&quot; her children.  The sadest and most amazing thing<br/>\nabout her attitude to me is how very common it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, I have always had an image of myself as a quitter, not least<br/>\nbecause me parents were always telling me what a failure I was.  They often<br/>\ntried to force me to do things, either initiating activities or trying to<br/>\nforce me to finish.  They never succeeded.  Not even once.

I think it makes much more sense towards a<br/>\nperson&#39;s emotional health to teach them that it is OK to not do something<br/>\nanymore if it is not good for them, or they do not enjoy it.

I tend to be someone that <br/>\nalways wants to analyze all sides to make my decision and I end up <br/>\nbeing indecisive.  Still,  after reading about unschooling,  I realized <br/>\nthat it would only work if I had faith in my children&#39;s abilities to <br/>\nlearn in this way.  So,  no matter how stressed and confused I was <br/>\nfeeling,  I worked really hard at walking the walk and talking the <br/>\ntalk - and you know what,  before I could convince myself,  my <br/>\nchildren convinced me.  Now it&#39;s out of my hands.  My youngest is 13 <br/>\n- this is his 4th year out of school.  He elected to try 7th grade <br/>\nlast year because he was curious about changing classes etc.  He <br/>\nstayed for one quarter and that was it.  He always has the choice.  <br/>\nOur agreement is that he can choose to return to ps and come home <br/>\nwhenever he wants,  but once he&#39;s home that&#39;s where he stays for the <br/>\nyear.  Of course,  he says he&#39;s never going back.  I remember <br/>\nthinking that if unschooling wasn&#39;t a good fit for us,  we&#39;d switch <br/>\ngears for high school.  Well.........like I said it&#39;s out of my hands <br/>\nnow.  He BELIEVES  and that&#39;s what&#39;s important.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think your boys have come home at a good time - before the *joys* <br/>\nof middle school.  Some people will disagree with me,  but I believe <br/>\nthat my kids deserve the choice and I let them make it.  Your kids <br/>\nhave been in school, they even experienced different schools.  They <br/>\nhave a lot of knowledge about both sides of the fence.  I&#39;ll bet <br/>\nthey&#39;re more than capable of leading their education.  Don&#39;t forget, <br/>\nthough,  they may need some major deschooling time.

It was a private <br/>\nkindergarten which as the yr progressed I referred to as college prep <br/>\nkindgrtn. They where using a 1-2 grade curriculum. In October, the teacher <br/>\ncalled me in for a conference and suggested I hold my son back the following <br/>\nyr for another yr of kndgtn. In October?<br/>\nI had already held him back a yr. They also suggested a tutor for the summer. <br/>\nThese people were dead serious. <br/>\n    Anyway the teacher had cards they had to flip when they were bad. They <br/>\nwent from green, to yellow, to red. My son always ended up on red. The <br/>\ninfractions were so petty. Son figured out he couldn&#39;t care less. &quot;All they <br/>\ngive you when your good is some plastic junk&quot; he told me. There were kids <br/>\nhowever that were devastated by red. I felt sorry for them. I also got angry <br/>\nbecause while on field trips I got the message from the kids that they all <br/>\nthought my son was a bad kid. Because of this teachers stupid punishment my <br/>\nlittle guy was being unfairly labeled, as where a few others. <br/>\nSorry I did not mean to go on so, guess it all still makes me mad. I did <br/>\nstand up to this woman and tell her I did not agree with her at all.

I have 5 children; 3 boys- 11, 10, 9 and 2<br/>\ngirls- 6 and 3.  We have tried various schooling methods:  p.s., hs, p.s., a one-rm<br/>\nrural schoolhouse (yes they still exist!), hs, and just until Friday, parochial<br/>\nschool.  In that order.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they were home, I tried my best to unschool but kept having nagging doubts.  In<br/>\nmy heart of hearts I believed that this was the way to go.  But, I was/am still<br/>\nunder the shackles of the system.  It is hard to break a lifetime of<br/>\nmanipulation--hmm, &quot;thought control&quot; as George Orwell said in 1984.  During the<br/>\ncourse of our educational trials, we as a family, converted to Catholicism.  So, I<br/>\nthought, &quot;Well, I haven&#39;t given the Catholic schools a try.  They are suppose to be<br/>\nso good in our Diocese.&quot;  So, against my boy&#39;s will, we went and looked at the<br/>\nschool the first week of Sept. and agreed w/the school to do a two month trial.  I&#39;m<br/>\nhere to tell you:  It&#39;s still school no matter how one tries to color it.  Actually,<br/>\nit was a great learning experience for us.  Myself and the boys have gotten a better<br/>\nappreciation for what we had at home.  And, it proved to me that unschooling works!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 6 yr old daughter although *loves* it!  It&#39;s kindergarten, she has friends and is<br/>\nstill going to continue.  Actually, she&#39;s why I considered it in the first place.<br/>\nShe *really* wanted to go to school.  Well, I told her she could finish kindergarten<br/>\nand then next year--it&#39;s home.  I realize I&#39;ll then have to deschool her.  The thing<br/>\nthat bugs me about this kindergarten is *everything* is rewarded--usually with<br/>\ncandy.  It&#39;s not enough to do a good job in and of itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does dh think?  Well since he refuses to read/listen to tapes on anything<br/>\nrelated to school/homeschool (he says he doesn&#39;t have time)  he has left the<br/>\nnitty-gritty details up to me.  I thank him for this because I&#39;m the one who has<br/>\nlived/done all the research and continue to do so.  He is annoyed that we keep<br/>\n&quot;changing our minds&quot; and fear that the kids will learn to be quitters.  I don&#39;t see<br/>\nus as quitters.  We try something, if it doesn&#39;t work we give ourselves *permission*<br/>\nto try another option.
