She thought that was more propaganda from the cigerette<br/>\ncompanies because if you think it is hard or that you can&#39;t, then you will<br/>\nfail and they will have that income back again.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also said that part of the problem is simply the learned habit of hand<br/>\nto mouth with the cigerette.

The man has been smoking unfiltered Pall<br/>\nMalls for 40 years!  He has chronic emphasyma. And yet he continues to<br/>\nsmoke.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe promises to quit this time.  Two weeks before the operation.  We&#39;ll see<br/>\nhow long it lasts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m 3500 miles away and can&#39;t help out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, remember, one day your kids could be hearing &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;cancer&quot; in the<br/>\nsame breath.  (No pun intended.)  Quit for them, too.  Plus, they&#39;re much<br/>\nless likely to smoke if you don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy in SoCal, who promises to do a real intro when the baby&#39;s bigger and I<br/>\nhave more time.
