The question that came up had to do with the origin of the term marathon.  Their version was a run for help.  One book version was a run for good news/celebration. The distance and exact path varied with the resource, but of course they both involved the town of Marathon.  I don&#39;t remember the &quot;right&quot; answer, but I remember thinking that the 70 mile? run for help made more sense to me than the 20 mile celebration run.  I think the runner died, but don&#39;t quote me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nI did enjoy looking it up in several place just for fun.  I pointed the variations out to the kids. They are able to take things with a &quot;grain of salt&quot;. (just like news, commercials, other peoples stories, etc).  I still think history &quot;dramas&quot; are an awesome if somewhat less than accurate way to enjoy the past. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeth in MD who loves PBS and would love to get the History channel, but can&#39;t get cable (boo hoo).<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95739,"nextTopicId":95784}}
