Sorry, I must <br/>\nhave missed that. And I think Joyce made the remark that maybe she want&#39;s to <br/>\ninteract but doesn&#39;t know how to go about it. Also when you said that the <br/>\nkids aren&#39;t quite as vocal and such as she is, maybe she does want to play <br/>\nbut just doesn&#39;t get the kind of response she&#39;s looking for. That mixed with <br/>\nboredom, again from not getting what she wants can add up to just kicking <br/>\nsomeone out of frustration of it all. I can understand that. Maybe trying <br/>\nsome older kids would help.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Sierra happens to get along great with kids her age and older kids too <br/>\nbut just loves ones a bit younger than her. She has this mother thing she <br/>\ndoes and plays really well with 4 and 5 year olds. My son and youngest <br/>\nhappen to like older kids more so but still get along great with kids the <br/>\nsame age or younger. It just seems like a preference they have right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you&#39;ll figure it out in no time with all the great advice flying <br/>\naround here.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet us know how it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet a speedy connection with MSN Broadband.ï¿½ Join now! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/freeactivation.asp\">http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/freeactivation.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90421708,"authorName":"LsMe@aol.com","from":"LsMe@...","profile":"katielouba","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Children&#39;s urges to hit","postDate":"1035484850","msgId":47763,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0NS4xMjk4YzY0LjJhZTk5OGIyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47853,"prevInTime":47762,"nextInTime":47764,"topicId":47763,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Mary: One thing Kalie gets a LOT of is one-on-one time with me!

She&#39;s our <br/>\nonly child, and I&#39;m home with her, and all day long she helps me with my <br/>\nwork, and reminds me to play! She sleeps in our room in her own little bed <br/>\n(half the night), and the other half in ours (if she wakes and wants to), and <br/>\nwe do lots of library trips and shopping and playgrounds and just fooling <br/>\naround together. I think she gets enough of me!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as trying to rile someone up - that is exactly how I would describe <br/>\nwhat she&#39;s doing, and the look on her face when she does it, although I coul<br/>\ndn&#39;t have put a name on it until now. It was suggested that she is trying to <br/>\ninteract with the other child and doesn&#39;t know how, and I think that might be <br/>\nvalid, too, but I also really like your idea that she&#39;s bored. She is the <br/>\noldest in her playgroup of 4 girls by 6 weeks, and the youngest is 6 months <br/>\nyounger, which can be a lot at age 3. I&#39;d suggested to my husband that I&#39;d <br/>\nlike to get her around some older children (girls and boys), because she <br/>\nseems more comfortable with the older ones, and also because the older <br/>\nchildren don&#39;t tolerate hitting, etc. as much - the little ones don&#39;t even <br/>\nreact except to scream. Kalie likes to play games, and she&#39;s used to asking <br/>\nquestions and having them answered, etc., where the other children still <br/>\naren&#39;t responding to much and don&#39;t &quot;converse&#39; like she does - their language <br/>\nis still pretty limited.  (We talk constantly at our house with her- she <br/>\nwants to know about everything!) <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have a different attitude toward children - we repond to Kalie when <br/>\nshe talks, instead of just ignoring or talking over her like the other <br/>\nparents in our group.All the others are in preschool situations, ballet <br/>\nclasses, etc - not our atttitude at all. They&#39;re all concerned about &quot;messes&quot; <br/>\nat their house, too - when Kalie dumps her toys here, they used to actually <br/>\ntell her not to, in shocked voices. (It was kind of funny, if it hadn&#39;t been <br/>\nso annying. I made it clear dumping is fine with me.) Maybe it&#39;s just time to <br/>\nfind some older, more appropriate playmates for her! (And we&#39;ve even been <br/>\nlearning the song, &quot;Make new friends, but keep the old..&quot; this week!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much, Mary. I feel much more hopeful about this situation now, with <br/>\nthe help everyone has given.<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Bianco&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummyone24@...\">mummyone24@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I&#39;ll just throw this question out. Does Kalie get enough attention and <br/>\none on one interaction with just you? I know you said she gets plenty of <br/>\nattention but I mean only you and her. I know it&#39;s hard, believe me with my <br/>\n4 it&#39;s hard to take the time for just me and one of them but my husband and <br/>\nI try very hard to do this often. Even if it&#39;s just a trip to the store.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso she sounds like she&#39;s just trying to rile someone up. Maybe she&#39;s bored <br/>\nand needs more stimulation? I&#39;m just talking out loud so if this isn&#39;t the <br/>\ncase, disregard!!! Maybe too, she is ahead of playing with her ages. Are <br/>\nthese kids her same age? I know my Alyssa (2) doesn&#39;t like to play with 2 <br/>\nyear old stuff and does much better with older kids. Then we she does get <br/>\naround younger ones, she has a tendency to play better because it&#39;s <br/>\ndifferent. But mostly she doesn&#39;t like to play like most 2 year olds.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47852,"nextTopicId":47274}}
