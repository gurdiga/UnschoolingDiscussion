My girls are beyond<br/>\nthat now..but sure enjoyed the warm fuzzies that all of your posts brought<br/>\nback to my memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here are some &#39;unschooling discussion questions, and mostly ramblings..<br/>\nI&#39;m still trying to let go of all of the trappings of &#39;school&#39;.. and really<br/>\nbe an unschooling family. But I cannot quite worrying if what the girls do<br/>\nwith their days is enough??? Even after reading so many unschooling books,<br/>\nand going to a Gatto seminar..(And buying his latest book!) I know I should<br/>\nhave all of this figured out by now.. We have been hm&#39;schoolers for 8yrs<br/>\ntoo!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest is 16yr old and has always been more &#39;bookish&#39;.. and does her own<br/>\nthing so well..(Mostly art, piano and gymnastics) But she was in ps for the<br/>\nfirst 2 yrs and then more traditional hm&#39;school until she was older. She is<br/>\nvery artistic and is thinking about college.. But I worry if she will really<br/>\nbe prepared?? She has never learned how to write well, except letters to<br/>\npenpals..will she handle all the note taking and college essays? Her time<br/>\nhas always been spent doing art, working out in the gym or just messing<br/>\naround outdoors..as she loves biology.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger two, ages 10 and 5 spend their days mostly playing pretend<br/>\ngames..like dress-up, roll-playing with their dolls and plastic animal<br/>\ncollections.  We do read allot together, play a few games(mom has to be<br/>\ntalked into that, as I&#39;m not much of a game person)..they love the computer,<br/>\nbut mostly just for the fun things - Crayola Paint n&#39; Play Pony &  Madeline<br/>\nstuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been loosely using Sonlight Curriculum for the past 3 years, but<br/>\nthis year it has been such a pain trying to follow the TM at all.. I<br/>\ncontinue to cling to it, as a way to keep decent looking records I guess.<br/>\nThat&#39;s another problem I have, making what the girls do with their<br/>\ntime..sound educational on paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 10 yo just recently learned to read, and does love books. But cannot do<br/>\ntraditional math at all. Any attempts at normal math-type workbooks, turn<br/>\ninto crying sessions and I have bought so many different things. She is<br/>\ngreat at counting her money and figuring out how much she has, when she<br/>\nwants to buy something at the store. I wish I were more creative in the math<br/>\narea, but I really don&#39;t enjoy math either. (but I sure don&#39;t want to<br/>\ncripple my girls in this area) I finally just put all the workbooks and math<br/>\nmanipulative in a &#39;math learning center&#39; and told her she can use them when<br/>\nor if she wants too..so far nothing happening with it tho.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk..this is getting pretty long, I just wish I could hang out with one of<br/>\nyou for a day and watch how your family unschools..knowing how you and your<br/>\nfamily spend a day or a week would be helpful. Do any of you have older<br/>\nteens that have went on to college or who are living on their own?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening,<br/>\nJulie in MO</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14634,"nextTopicId":14648}}
