Here is OUR <br/>\nstory.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has enrolled in a program here in WA state called &quot;Running Start&quot;.  He <br/>\nis able to (as a Jr. in High School) have a dual enrollment type of situation <br/>\nwhere he can take both High School and College classes, receiving credit for <br/>\nboth.  When we met with the High School Counselor, he asked if we intended to <br/>\nget a High School Diploma, we said &quot;yes&quot;.  He then explained that the high <br/>\nschool would not be willing to give him any credits for his first 2 years of <br/>\nhigh school even though he had accomplished a great many things in English <br/>\nand Mathematics (required courses).  They were going to require him to <br/>\nfulfill 4 years of High School English, Math and History credits - without <br/>\ntesting him, without being willing to see if he had already covered those <br/>\nareas.  When I asked if he would get his 2 year degree (An Associates Degree) <br/>\nthey said &quot;yes, of course he will still get that, BUT he won&#39;t have a high <br/>\nschool diploma!&quot;  Well - HELLLLOOOO????  Do we really CARE if he has a <br/>\ndiploma?  He will have the first 2 years of his college education under his <br/>\nbelt, and a &quot;piece of paper&quot; to prove THAT!!  Are &quot;they&quot; going to ask if he <br/>\nhas a HIGH SCHOOL diploma if he has an AA??  Don&#39;t think so.  The counselor <br/>\nwas astounded that we didn&#39;t CARE about the diploma, as long as he gets the <br/>\nAA.  See, my son wants to get his AA in Pre-law and then join the Navy and <br/>\nget into Law School.  A diploma is NOT the be all and end all -- there are <br/>\nMANY ways to accomplish what is important without that fancy scripted piece <br/>\nof paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Purgingnut@xxx.xxx","from":"Purgingnut@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"alSVwRW9z7PcbT2Huzs5LNciE760ksKIXRR4RFNuIHbbPUxemntJjmv2islRJe42wwyCO2eCRAoR","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 267","postDate":"940871052","msgId":4035,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNjguNDAzNS45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4057,"prevInTime":4034,"nextInTime":4036,"topicId":4035,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/25/99 6:01:36 AM Central Daylight Time, Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-878436876\">In a message dated 10/25/99 6:01:36 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; <br/>\n Hi Lisa,<br/>\n <br/>\n Thanks for responding.
