Re: Mandatory AIDS vaccinations","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1305603711\">FYI<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nRe: Mandatory AIDS vaccinations<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Report Predicts Massive Resistance to Mandatory AIDS Vaccine<br/>\n&gt; Wes Vernon<br/>\n&gt; Thursday, June 21, 2001<br/>\n&gt; WASHINGTON - A new report predicts massive resistance to a mandatory AIDS<br/>\n&gt; vaccine is coming in the U.S. in the next few years.<br/>\n&gt; Millions of parents would refuse to have their children vaccinated by any<br/>\n&gt; variation of an HIV/AIDS shot, the Committee to Protect Medical Freedom<br/>\n&gt; said at a news conference Wednesday.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The paper, titled &quot;If AIDS doesn&#39;t kill you, the AIDS vaccine will,&quot;<br/>\n&gt; declared an AIDS vaccine would have HIV in it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Among those supporting the findings of the study was Dr. Howard Umovitz, a<br/>\n&gt; prominent member of a group of scientists calling for an HIV/AIDS vaccine<br/>\n&gt; moratorium.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jim Turner, a Washington attorney and expert on the swine flu vaccine<br/>\n&gt; scandal of the 1970s, lent his support, as did Barbara Lee Fisher,<br/>\n&gt; co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center.<br/>\n&gt; Redmond Handy, an opponent of the military&#39;s mandatory anthrax vaccination<br/>\n&gt; program, also warned of what he sees as the dangers of rushing into a<br/>\n&gt; mandatory AIDS vaccine program.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The thrust of the report, written by Clifford Kincaid, is that there&#39;s big<br/>\n&gt; money in rushing the an AIDS vaccine to market, some of it tied up in<br/>\n&gt; conflict-of-interest questions involving the promoters and their<br/>\n&gt; connections with companies that stand to benefit. More to the point, he<br/>\n&gt; says, there are indications that the vaccine, possibly to be administered<br/>\n&gt; to 11- to 12-year-old children, or perhaps earlier, contains a risk of<br/>\n&gt; inflicting the very disease it is intended to prevent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Promoting the idea of a mandatory AIDS vaccine is United Nations<br/>\n&gt; Secretary-General Kofi Anan, along with high-tech magnate Bill Gates.<br/>\n&gt; Kincaid challenges them to take the vaccine themselves if they are so<br/>\n&gt; certain it is safe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some of the discussions on radio talk shows around the country indicate<br/>\n&gt; &quot;the U.S. could witness massive civil disobedience against a massive<br/>\n&gt; mandatory HIV/AIDS vaccine. Parents want to know what is in the vaccine,<br/>\n&gt; and they should be told that it is a form of HIV that the government says<br/>\n&gt; can cause AIDS,&quot; the report alleges.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jon Cohen, author of &quot;Deep Denial,&quot; published by the New York Academy of<br/>\n&gt; Sciences earlier this year, is quoted as saying that &quot;medical products<br/>\n&gt; sometimes do the opposite of what they are supposed to do, causing illness<br/>\n&gt; rather than alleviating it. Such risk, of course, is common to all drugs,<br/>\n&gt; but at least many sick patients accept that they would have fared poorly<br/>\n&gt; even without the ill-fated drug treatment. Vaccines, in contrast, are<br/>\n&gt; administered to [healthy] people, often children.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Which means the vaccine would be targeted at those without AIDS. Further,<br/>\n&gt; AIDS is most likely to be avoided by choosing a healthful way of life. The<br/>\n&gt; study asks: Does it make sense to subject innocent children or AIDS-free<br/>\n&gt; military personnel to a risk that could be greater than the that of the<br/>\n&gt; disease, depending on the habits chosen as they go forward in their lives?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Polio and smallpox, for example, could strike without warning. The public<br/>\n&gt; has been warned about AIDS and how to avoid it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In anticipation of Wednesday&#39;s news conference, various health agencies<br/>\n&gt; have told Gannett News Service there was no plan to make the AIDS vaccine<br/>\n&gt; mandatory for any American.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But Kincaid, the director of the Committee to Protect American Freedoms,<br/>\n&gt; says the proof is available at the Web site of the U.S. Military HIV<br/>\n&gt; research program, where it is openly stated that AIDS vaccines under<br/>\n&gt; development will be &quot;licensed and used to protect military personnel.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; These shots are not voluntary in the military service, he says.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kincaid added that Dr. Deborah Brix, who runs the program, could have made<br/>\n&gt; the denial in the 30 days since he asked her in writing a series of<br/>\n&gt; questions about the program. His question included: &quot;Who made the decision<br/>\n&gt; to use and mandate this vaccine on U.S. military personnel?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder of the National Vaccine Information Center,<br/>\n&gt; reports that a member of the federal committee that recommends vaccine for<br/>\n&gt; children had said that an AIDS vaccine would be tested and then forced on<br/>\n&gt; all 12-year-old children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Neal Halsey, M.D., chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)<br/>\n&gt; Committee on Infectious Diseases, reminded HIV vaccine researchers and<br/>\n&gt; developers at a meeting in February 1997 of an advisory committee of the<br/>\n&gt; federal Centers for Disease Control that CDC plans to target 11- to<br/>\n&gt; 12-year-old children for &quot;universal application&quot; of an HIV vaccine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Kincaid study says &quot;babies are being used as guinea pigs now.&quot; The<br/>\n&gt; National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, under the auspices<br/>\n&gt; of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, is sponsoring an<br/>\n&gt; HIV vaccine test on babies born to HIV-infected women.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A spokesman for this program, where mothers have no ability to provide<br/>\n&gt; informed written consent, has admitted that &quot;a small percentage of our<br/>\n&gt; trial applicants have become infected&quot; and now have access to &quot;the best<br/>\n&gt; medical care available.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One cannot get any details as to who the &quot;guinea pigs&quot; are. Have they<br/>\n&gt; chosen to remain anonymous? &quot;Or are their identities being concealed<br/>\n&gt; because they are dead or dying?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dr. Umovitz, a member of a group of scientists calling for a moratorium on<br/>\n&gt; all HIV vaccine research, says coverage of &quot;promising&quot; vaccines is<br/>\n&gt; extremely misleading, and those being tested so far appear harmful and<br/>\n&gt; dangerous. Some undergoing trials increase the likelihood of infection and<br/>\n&gt; accelerate the disease. In a paper, he quotes Dr. Albert Sabin as saying<br/>\n&gt; the available data &quot;provide no basis for testing any HIV vaccine in<br/>\n&gt; humans.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; U.N. leader Anan and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has engaged in extensive<br/>\n&gt; research on AIDS, think an AIDS vaccine just may be a &quot;secret weapon.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But the Committee to Protect Medical Freedom concludes: &quot;What if the<br/>\n&gt; theory driving the vaccine research is scientifically bankrupt? .. What if<br/>\n&gt; their war on AIDS proves to be a no-win war in which millions more die?<br/>\n&gt; Then the world will move on to the next crisis and the same people may<br/>\n&gt; still be in charge.&quot; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"epoxies","from":"epoxies &lt;epoxies@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"IxQN3SH3MUg4OFnIpMcEQUS6je3W6JD-QGGdIevCgpsT_zfmhz3ecn1Fq-_oNYlTvNjV9uuHwZdNf_VxU2IMBFTB","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Big Brother is it again!","postDate":"952011108","msgId":22800,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4QkU4OTY0LjdFMjBAZmxhc2gubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDEwNjI4MjI1ODAzLjIzNjgzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22799,"nextInTopic":22805,"prevInTime":22799,"nextInTime":22801,"topicId":22760,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Please remove me from your list","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-849000855\">Please remove me from your list</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"epoxies","from":"epoxies &lt;epoxies@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"zOtVpu0VtEiL3gsel9VrVkjX3ZKYg-58WX80M7BFR-3gHR1qzJ5-i1IWb_qzzlj6OxuB4U5RzsYuabjBgOAklV1V","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Big Brother is it again!","postDate":"952011070","msgId":22799,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4QkU4OTNELjQwODZAZmxhc2gubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDEwNjI4MjI1ODAzLjIzNjgzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPiA8MDBkNzAxYzEwMDM0JDUzM2QyNGUwJDc0NWRkMWQxQGxkaW9ubm8+"},"prevInTopic":22779,"nextInTopic":22800,"prevInTime":22798,"nextInTime":22800,"topicId":22760,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Please remove me from your list","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1184832493\">Please remove me from your list</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22804,"nextTopicId":22808}}
