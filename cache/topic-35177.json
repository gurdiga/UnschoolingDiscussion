I have sort of an unusual<br/>\n&gt; situation on my hands, and would greatly appreciate any advice you<br/>\n&gt; can give me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve vacillated in my approach to home learning, but basically have<br/>\n&gt; remained somewhat of a &#39;radical&#39; unschooler, in that I can barely<br/>\n&gt; stomache anything that even looks like &#39;school&#39;.  I don&#39;t judge<br/>\n&gt; anyone else for thier different approaches to home learning, but for<br/>\n&gt; our family, this just &#39;fits&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I will definately &#39;bend&#39; in this particular situation, which<br/>\n&gt; will &#39;probably&#39; be temporary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I live in Oregon, and tried to access the &#39;orsig&#39; group, but it was<br/>\n&gt; unavailable for some reason.  I don&#39;t know of any other groups for my<br/>\n&gt; state, so I decided to come here, because I&#39;m an unschooler, and you<br/>\n&gt; have lots of members for me to draw advice from.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m raising my grandson, and we&#39;ve been, (for the most part),<br/>\n&gt; unschooling since he was a baby.  He&#39;s almost 7 now, and smart as a<br/>\n&gt; whip, a whiz with math, yet slow to warm up to reading, or any type<br/>\n&gt; of &#39;busywork&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oregon is a homeschooling friendly state, and basically stays out of<br/>\n&gt; our business, with the exception of testing every three years.  By<br/>\n&gt; the time my grandson is seven, I will need to file an &#39;intent to<br/>\n&gt; homeschool&#39; with the school district, and have him tested every three<br/>\n&gt; years from there on out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t been involved in any homeschool support groups, because<br/>\n&gt; there just hasn&#39;t been the need for it thus far, and some of the<br/>\n&gt; things I&#39;ve read about &#39;cliques&#39;, and &#39;elitism&#39; in some homeschool<br/>\n&gt; groups, I don&#39;t know if I ever will join one, because I&#39;m very<br/>\n&gt; unconventional in my beliefs and in our home learning, I just don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; see me finding a group that would be supportive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a friend who homeschools her children, in much the same way as<br/>\n&gt; I do, and we get together often for outings and such, and that seems<br/>\n&gt; to satisfy my grandson&#39;s need for social interaction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okay, at long last, here&#39;s the situation.  Another grandson, from<br/>\n&gt; another state...California, who is almost eight, is here with us now,<br/>\n&gt; and will be with us at least until the end of the school year.  There<br/>\n&gt; were some serious personal problems in his family that prompted his<br/>\n&gt; coming to us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The two of them get along wonderfully, except for the<br/>\n&gt; usual &#39;bullying&#39; type stuff that he learned in public school, and in<br/>\n&gt; his life thus far.  But the new grandson responds beautifully to<br/>\n&gt; being loved and respected, and has a sweet spirit in him that just<br/>\n&gt; needs a little more encouragement than most, because his life has<br/>\n&gt; been nothing but unpredictable, neglected, and emotionally abused.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He has expressed a great desire to be homeschooled with the other<br/>\n&gt; one, rather than go to our local public elementary school.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I believe this would be the best for everyone concerned, but when his<br/>\n&gt; mother disenrolled him in California, she was told that he would have<br/>\n&gt; to recieve a passing grade to be enrolled again in California next<br/>\n&gt; year.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t have a clue where to begin to find out what the requirements<br/>\n&gt; are for a passing grade in California for second grade.  I know I can<br/>\n&gt; have him tested here, in Oregon, but I&#39;m sure they test for Oregon<br/>\n&gt; requirements.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is a great likelihood that he might remain here with us in<br/>\n&gt; Oregon after the current family crisis is over, but should things<br/>\n&gt; improve enough that he should return to his mother, I don&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; send him home without the requirements to enter third grade in<br/>\n&gt; California.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any advice you have would be so greatly appreciated!  Thank you in<br/>\n&gt; advance for anything you can advise me on here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ruby<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
