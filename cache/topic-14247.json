I collect them in coffee cans between <br/>\ntimes, and melt them on the stove, with the coffee can inside an older (used) <br/>\npot which is sitting on something.  Sometimes it&#39;s a cookie cutter or a <br/>\n&quot;church key&quot; can opener, and sometimes the edge is up on top of a little <br/>\nstoneware cookie press.  Something not too tall, not too important, and which <br/>\nwon&#39;t be ruined by being in boiling water for a while.   That&#39;s to keep the <br/>\ncan from hopping around in there in making a mess.  Trust me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen put aluminum foil on the counter next to where you&#39;re going to be <br/>\nworking.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kitchen is all fancy, do this on a coleman stove or portable <br/>\nhotplate, on a yucky table in a yucky place in your house or yard.  I&#39;ve done <br/>\nit different ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo get the wax melted.  It doesn&#39;t matter if there are aluminum votive-candle <br/>\nwick-bases in there, or old aluminum foil or labels.  Let&#39;m be in there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDip sticks or bark or whatever, in kindling-sizes, like the size of your <br/>\nfinger, and long enough that you have a handle to deal with.  Wax on half the <br/>\nstick is fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nLay them out on aluminum foil or in a cardboard box (like beer or cat food <br/>\ncome in is good, or the lid from a case of paper), but the aluminum foil on <br/>\nthe counter can keep wax from making such a mess.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can let the wax get hard again in the same can for next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband recommends this (and I do it sometimes; did this time):  Put water <br/>\nin with the wax.   You can dip higher up on the stick with less wax.  The <br/>\nstick gets wax going in and coming out.  Having water under the wax in the <br/>\ncan doesn&#39;t hurt it.  The wax floats.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not the greatest thing on the planet for the chimney, so you might <br/>\nwant to get the chimney cleaned as often as you should have already (or more <br/>\noften, if you&#39;re a meticulous person who always calls the chimney cleaners on <br/>\ntime).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s more aesthetic value in starting a fire with this than with paper, <br/>\nthough, and paper has that danger of floating up and out and onto your <br/>\nneighbor&#39;s roof.  Yuck.  No waxy-stick has ever floated up. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThese don&#39;t make the first-pass firestarters, but the second.  Still start <br/>\nthe fire with teensy-kindling, but if you put in some small stuff and then a <br/>\ncouple of waxy sticks as a second layer, the wax will drip down on the other <br/>\nstuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I take the still-hot leftover wax outside and pour it where the <br/>\nwood has been being split, or where there&#39;s a pile of bark we&#39;ve had for a <br/>\ncouple of years from some tree that had really stringy bark.  And then the <br/>\nnext day or so I go out and pick up clumps of wax-with-wood-crud things which <br/>\nlook ugly and aren&#39;t good enough for gifts and might have dirt in them, or <br/>\nleaves or dog hair, but they&#39;re great for home use.  The pretty sticks go to <br/>\nmy friends&#39; houses. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor kids who are old enough to deal with hot wax and fire (not many of them <br/>\nare; some adults aren&#39;t!) it&#39;s fun and not nearly as crazy-making as dipping <br/>\ncandles.  But  it might be a good warm-up practice for future candle dipping <br/>\n(which also sometimes uses that water-in-the-bottom mix).<br/>\n<br/>\nCrayons tend to stink and spaark, but I&#39;ve used some as additives.  I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t recommend them.  Some colors stain badly (even on bricks and such) <br/>\nif dripped.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"tento9@aol.com","from":"tento9@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"lDSGlbjsuhrVOVadeIAmM8-x0I2hF1i-ppdzTevkkWY3i2RQKYaDtuKUIJxEJQSRsJ41ESY","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] fire starters","postDate":"975295055","msgId":14250,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRjLmQyNTczY2MuMjc1MzJjNGZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14249,"nextInTopic":14251,"prevInTime":14249,"nextInTime":14251,"topicId":14247,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"yeah you can also melt down old crayons and candle stubs in a double boiler ( an old bowl over a pot with bowling water) and pour it over the pine cones or ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-25413048\">yeah you can also melt down old crayons and candle stubs in a double boiler ( <br/>\nan old bowl over a pot with bowling water) and pour it over the pine cones or <br/>\ninto the bottoms of the milk cartoons it works really well.<br/>\nmax</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Colette and Andrew","from":"&quot;Colette and Andrew&quot; &lt;woofermom@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ywdkXs-MqFEYlJc5_p6Elw6Fy0ZoDr-m_VgR2mtp6Ok2z3HEgYXLqV-6P9QcbaBBlIGNSKJtcl3CNSbb0RtFopTJawVCpf2zTd-vc8o7pYkdBrI9rc0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] fire starters","postDate":"975295027","msgId":14249,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWYwMWMwNTgyMCQ4NzlkM2FjMCQ3YWFiMTRkMUBjb21wYXE+","referencesHeader":"PDYzLmU0ZjM5ZDEuMjc1MzIxNGNAYW9sLmNvbT4gPDAwMGQwMWMwNTgyMCQyYWJiNzU2MCQ3YWFiMTRkMUBjb21wYXE+"},"prevInTopic":14248,"nextInTopic":14250,"prevInTime":14248,"nextInTime":14250,"topicId":14247,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That was supposed to read ..... since we are NOT the fancy type of people.
