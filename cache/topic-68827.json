For example....there is a camp out in July<br/>\n&gt; that is only about 1/2 hour from us (sounded like fun to me). I told<br/>\n&gt; him tonight that I would like to go (even though DD is only 2) so that<br/>\n&gt; we can start to get to know the local homeschoolers and he does not<br/>\n&gt; want to go. His reasoning (if you can call if that) is that he<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t want to go because he doesn&#39;t know anyone! I asked him how he<br/>\n&gt; thought we were going to get to know anyone if we never went to these<br/>\n&gt; things to get to know people?! He didn&#39;t really have an answer except<br/>\n&gt; that he has only ever camped with family.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds perfectly logical to me!  I&#39;m not big on going to things where I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know anybody.  I have a much easier time going to something that I<br/>\nonly know one person in the crowd, just because I feel a little safer.<br/>\nMaybe your son feels the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you go alone to something, perhaps not as long as the campout?  Then you<br/>\ncould check out the scene, talk to other parents, and maybe get a phone<br/>\nnumber or two.  If you know people, he might be more relaxed about going.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68825,"nextTopicId":68829}}
