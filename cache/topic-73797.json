The kids and I, I had 5 at the time) drove from Texas to \r<br/>\nAlaska and we had a ball!  We had lots of drawing and coloring supplies with<br/>\n\r<br/>\nsmall lap desks for each of the kids.  I packed loads of easy, not too \r<br/>\nmessy, snacks and drinks, small toys, etc.  We sang a lot, made lots of \r<br/>\npitstops at parks and interesting places.  Probably the best thing I had was<br/>\n\r<br/>\nthe TV and VR.  Ours is built into our conversion van but you can buy cables<br/>\n\r<br/>\nto convert the power and hook up a small one from home.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAll in all, plan lots of extra goof time.  Getting out and walking around \r<br/>\nmade the trip a pleasure.  I made sure to point out lots of scenery, natural<br/>\n\r<br/>\nand otherwise, to the kids so we had lots of great talks on the way there.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYou can do it! &lt;g&gt;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73796,"nextTopicId":73789}}
