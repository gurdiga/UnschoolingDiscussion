These &#39;kids&#39; of mine are boys aged 17, 13, 10! They are majorly into fighting style Playstation and computer games! When they do come outside, it is generally to go down to the bush to find &#39;staves&#39; to fight with. Can you<br/>\nimagine what the veggie garden would look like after that?  Thanks, but I think I&#39;ll give that suggestion a miss &lt;bg&gt;!<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14765,"nextTopicId":14770}}
