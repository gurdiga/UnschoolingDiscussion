We are getting<br/>\none this fall, a minivan no less.  In that four years we have gone from one<br/>\n3.5 year old to a 7 year old, a 2 year old and we&#39;ll have a new born.  I<br/>\nhave reached the limit of what I feel I can handle without one.  It is<br/>\nbegining to limit what I can do for/with the kids.  And for/with my family.<br/>\nIn other words--the benefits finacially and health wise are no longer<br/>\noutweighed by other benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;ve been glad to have these years.  Glad that we all had to be more<br/>\nthoughtful about what we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I&#39;ll be really glad not to take three kids on the city<br/>\nbuses.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all about trade offs.  If you feel you are still giving enough options<br/>\nand don&#39;t feel trapped by no car (I didn&#39;t for years) then good for you.<br/>\nThey cost a bloody fortune!  That&#39;s money for other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62565,"nextTopicId":62616}}
