It was a fight just to get her to do 1/2 her math, read and answer a few questions in science or history.  Today we are still deschooling some, but our life is 100% better, I wouldn&#39;t change this for a milliion dollars.  For the first time my dd and I aren&#39;t fighting, we actually enjoy each others company.  Unschooling has permeated all areas of our life and peace abounds.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Kay<br/>\n<br/>\nPAULA PARMENTER &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bead@...\">bead@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  We too were almost ready to send our daughter to school.
