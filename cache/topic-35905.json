We watched television in Japanese and in De Englishu and <br/>\nwandered around downtown Kyoto.  We had neighbors who spoke no <br/>\nEnglish, so we used big hand signals and a little compact translator <br/>\nfor the words we couldn&#39;t understand no matter how much we waved.  <br/>\nAnd we didn&#39;t need Japanese to get around.  We could recognize the <br/>\ncharacters on the bus to get home.  Often we would be approached by <br/>\nsomeone who spoke English (once by a kind of scary guy outside <br/>\nTakashima shopping center, who frothed a bit at the mouth and <br/>\ninvited us home with him, we had some reasonable excuse not to go).  <br/>\nBut we didn&#39;t have complete immersion in the language.  Our day to <br/>\nday lives were filled with English.  We lived and my husband worked <br/>\non a campus for foreign researchers in Japan.  We could get American <br/>\nnews, and Chinese news, and Filipino news, and German news, and <br/>\nBritish news,etc..., on the local channels (it always amazed us, or <br/>\ndepressed us, I guess, that American news would open with something <br/>\nAmerican even when there had been a major international story, like <br/>\nthe earthquake in India, while everybody else, except, maybe, Russia <br/>\nwould open with the international story first--and American news <br/>\ndidn&#39;t even cover the overthrow of the Filipino government...).  If <br/>\nSimon had been going to daycare he would have picked up Japanese.  <br/>\nAnd he would have begun to recognize kanji.  If someone had been <br/>\ncuddling up to me and reading books to me I would have begun to <br/>\nrecognize the language, as well.  If there was a need or a desire we <br/>\nwould have learned Japanese.  But, it is very easy to be <br/>\nfunctionally illiterate, particularly if you have a first language <br/>\nto fall back on.  I could still read a novel or a book of folk tales <br/>\nor a book on organic gardening in English if I so chose. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have no recollection of learning to read.  I read before school.  <br/>\nNo one taught me.  I couldn&#39;t diagram a sentence to save my <br/>\nproverbial... and I have a minor in English.  I don&#39;t know why I <br/>\nknow how to read.  I can remember learning handwriting from my <br/>\nmother.  I was changing from an open school that hadn&#39;t taught <br/>\ncursive or the times tables to a public school that required both of <br/>\nthose skills.  We spent the summer writing a story about pioneer <br/>\nchildren in cursive in a Big Chief notebook.  And, apparently, I <br/>\nhave no memory of this, I learned my times tables overnight.  My <br/>\nhandwriting is poor.  My understanding of grammer is poor.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nneed to know grammer rules to know when I&#39;ve written a sentence <br/>\ncorrectly, that&#39;s what Word is for.  I get the little red or green <br/>\nwavy line and I know that if I choose I can make a sentence <br/>\ncorrectly, or I can leave it.  So I split infinitives, so I end with <br/>\nprepositions, eh, it isn&#39;t going to keep me out of a job or make me <br/>\nunhappy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, constantly reminding my son of his inability to read will make <br/>\nhim unhappy.  Hounding him with phonics, or not coming in and <br/>\nreading whatever his gameboy or his computer game is requiring of <br/>\nhim will also make him unhappy.  He doesn&#39;t need to know the rules <br/>\nof phonetics.  He needs attention.  I am not teaching my daughter <br/>\nher ABC&#39;s.  They seem to be hampering my son&#39;s understanding of the <br/>\nsounds letters make.  I don&#39;t know if it will make a difference.  <br/>\nLinnaea wanders around singing &quot;ABCLMOPSTV, now ABC&quot; even without my <br/>\ninput.  There is no way to demonstrate that trusting your children <br/>\nis enough.  My mom, when I asked her what she thought about my <br/>\nhomeschooling the kids, said &quot;I trust you, even if I wouldn&#39;t do it, <br/>\nI trust you.&quot;  If she can trust me to raise my children to adulthood <br/>\nthan I can trust my children to grow into adulthood.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t agree with this statement as written.

We had a little spelling discussion while eating chicken nuggets <br/>\nand talked about compound words and how sauce is spelled and why <br/>\nbungie-jumping-Barbies tend to get the dog a bit excitied.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this is a kid with no formal or systemized reading or phonics lessons. <br/>\nYet she was able to convey her thoughts in writing pretty clearly. And *I* <br/>\nknow how much progress she&#39;s made by seeing all those correctly spelled <br/>\nwords that used to be more inventive.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake from this what you will. Works for us. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"IS A SPELLING PROGRAM IMPORTANT TO SOME?
