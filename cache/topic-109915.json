These are really<br/>\ngood.   You could keep some on hand and Cameron could heat and eat them<br/>\nwith rice or noodles and vegetables, or as they are for a quick protein<br/>\nfix.   This way you don&#39;t have to buy extra ingredients to try to make<br/>\nplain tofu taste like something other than muck. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOther companies that make prepared, marinated tofu:  Soyco, Blue Lotus,<br/>\nNutrisoy and Kingland Soy.   These are all very easy, can be eaten cold<br/>\nor heated and chunked and added to vegetables or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a variety of seasoning packets for plain tofu and &quot;shake and<br/>\nbake&quot; style things. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are prepared deli slices of vegan &quot;turkey&quot; and other lunch meats. <br/>\nOn nights when you are really not into fixing a vegetarian alternative<br/>\nmaybe he could make himself a sandwich.   The Tofurky people now make<br/>\nsliced tofurky for turkey sandwiches.  David says it&#39;s not bad but he&#39;d<br/>\ntake genuine dead bird over tofurky any day.  Nine out of ten turkeys<br/>\ndisagree. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are vegan hot dogs if he&#39;d like that.  I was never a hot dog fan<br/>\nbut Dylan likes these when we go camping. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nFast for Cam to fix on his own or for you when you&#39;re not inspired by any<br/>\nof the recipes I&#39;ll be sending you off list.  &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile not super high in protein hummus and Baba Ganoush will last a few<br/>\ndays in the fridge for quick sandwiches or dips.   Falafel is fast and<br/>\nfilling in a pita.    <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"lone vegetarians","postDate":"1132151490","msgId":109915,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI1Ni4xMzE1YTI2LjMwYWM5Y2MyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":109929,"prevInTime":109914,"nextInTime":109916,"topicId":109915,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
