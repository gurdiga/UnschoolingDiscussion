What do you folks think about having bedtimes? Do many <br/>\nof you find your children often open up and want to discuss everything <br/>\npersonal to them at bedtime? When my children need sone individual time or <br/>\nsomething is heavy on their hearts, they ask to sleep with me. My husband is <br/>\non the road most of the time so we usually end up having deep converstions <br/>\nlate into the night with the older children. Right now we have bedtimes but I <br/>\nam considering changing it.<br/>\n Johanna <br/>\n Life is the ultimate learning experience!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    I wish we had a better bed time thing going here. Soon as Spring hits and <br/>\ndaylight lengthens so does this kids clock. She has difficulty falling <br/>\nasleep,always has actually. I try and get her in there around 9 and I usually <br/>\nemerge half asleep after 10. I read the whole time and tell a story. She gets <br/>\nup around 8:30 at the latest. I have tried waking her early but it makes her <br/>\nsurly and the day goes to hell.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I envy parents whose children go to bed at 7:30. But it wouldn&#39;t work in <br/>\nthis family during summer. Dh and I are both mountain bikers and each night <br/>\nit is a tag team event. Who is running or riding (not enough time for both to <br/>\nridr in one night). Summer is exhausting but so short here you miss it <br/>\nterribly soon enough. Each year we say we&#39;ll come up w/ a better plan. Maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I would love to spend more time w/ dh. I hardly hear about his day <br/>\nanymore,we are both asleep by 11.<br/>\n<br/>\n   NICKI~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24202,"nextTopicId":24198}}
