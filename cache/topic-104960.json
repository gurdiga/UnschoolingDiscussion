I was raised in a family where I had to sit at the table with a timer if I had not finished diner with the family.  When the timer rang and I was still not done I was punished, and they wondered why I had and eating problem.  My kids eat pretty much what they want when they want.  And to top it off 3 of my 4 kids have turned vegan so I am learning the wonders of cooking vegan.  I usually make 2 versions of meals, one with meat (for husband and youngest) and one without (I can go either way).  All snacks and deserts are made vegan.  I refuse to get upset by my kids food choices, I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s important enough.  They usually make good choices and when they don&#39;t it&#39;s temporary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the interesting views,<br/>\nSheryl<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;do not meddle with the affairs of dragons, for you are crunchy and good <br/>\nwith ketchup.&quot;  annon.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Speaking the Truth in times of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.&quot; George Orwell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] ideas for letting go of control","postDate":"1111949937","msgId":104970,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0OS40MjFhY2FiNy4yZjc4NWM3MUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":104960,"nextInTopic":104983,"prevInTime":104969,"nextInTime":104971,"topicId":104960,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/26/2005 10:15:19 PM Mountain Standard Time, brewstersears@sympatico.ca writes: If  anyone can remember their letting go of the control of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-629263494\">In a message dated 3/26/2005 10:15:19 PM Mountain Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brewstersears@...\">brewstersears@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf  anyone can remember their &quot;letting go of the control of food choices of <br/>\ntheir  children&quot; phase enough to remember what tips helped them reach the other <br/>\nside  and would like to share them here, I would be so grateful to read more <br/>\nof  these, and perhaps print them out for my binder!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n============<br/>\n <br/>\nMine was with babies, but it helped me to remember my friend &quot;Snail&quot;(Lisa)  <br/>\nwho lived on mostly donuts and cheap breakfast pastries for three years or so  <br/>\nafter she moved out of her (crazy) parents&#39; house, and I never remember her  <br/>\nbeing sick or lacking energy in all that time.  I never saw her eat fruit,  <br/>\nvegetables or meat.  Bread and cheese a time or two, and  cake.    She was in the <br/>\nSCA, and we&#39;d go camping for days or a  week, and she would turn down offers <br/>\nof fresh-cooked food or cooler sandwich  food in favor of the coffee cake or <br/>\nsweetrolls she had brought (because they  seemed more medieval to her than <br/>\ndonuts).<br/>\n <br/>\nShe married a physicist (which made her physics-geek parents happy) who was  <br/>\nalso a cook, and she started eating WILD stuff, like fire-roasted goat, and  <br/>\nartichokes and mushrooms and chicken and broccoli.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI remembered seeing parents try to force babies to eat baby food, and I saw  <br/>\ntoo many other moms harranguing kids one way or another, and see that neither  <br/>\nthe food nor the family nor the child was benefitting at all.<br/>\n <br/>\nMeanwhile, my kids were calm and happy, not hungry (or if they were they  <br/>\nwould reach for food or ask to nurse or get food) and not afraid of food, or  <br/>\navoiding it, or sneaking it nor being ecstatic at seeing it.  There wasn&#39;t  a lot <br/>\nof emotion tied up in food.  It was as available as air or water, and  so it <br/>\ncame to be like air or water, and they didn&#39;t abuse or reject or long for  or <br/>\nhoard it.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":93086594,"authorName":"Sears Family","from":"&quot;Sears Family&quot; &lt;brewstersears@...&gt;","profile":"birthinlove","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"ideas for letting go of control","postDate":"1111894127","msgId":104960,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmEwMWM1MzI3ZCQxNjM1ZTllMCQ2NjAxYThjMEBTRUFSU0M+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":104970,"prevInTime":104959,"nextInTime":104961,"topicId":104960,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello again, As I ponder what may work for me as I shed my controls over my children s food choices, these ideas have come to mind. -printed out inspiring","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-203406824\">Hello again,<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I ponder what may work for me as I shed my controls over my children&#39;s food choices, these ideas have come to mind.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-printed out inspiring e-mails and articles and put them in a binder in the kitchen so I can reach for it in a weak moment <br/>\n<br/>\n-created 2 affirmations for myself<br/>\n  1.
