Some people are<br/>\nmore naturally hormonally charged and thus more curious than others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd think about it this way: Boys tend to be more visual. Girls tend to be<br/>\nmore verbal. Girls can read bodice busters to get their curiosity<br/>\nsatisified. But boys get their curiosity blocked because there isn&#39;t any<br/>\nacceptable &quot;pornography&quot; for boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre pictures of naked women or even people having sex worse than reading<br/>\nabout 16 yos being raped repeatedly and then falling in love with their<br/>\nmassively muscled, large membered rapists? (If you&#39;ve never read one the sex<br/>\nis *very* graphic. Flowery language, but nothing is left to the imagination.<br/>\nIt&#39;s how *I* figured out the details about sex that no one felt I needed to<br/>\nknow at 15 ;-) They didn&#39;t lead to anything other than more books until I<br/>\nmet my future husband at 22.) And any girl can pick one up at any age<br/>\nwithout most people even batting an eye. But boys don&#39;t have anything even<br/>\nclose to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you say no, you&#39;re creating a forbidden fruit situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we forbid something they really want and that stops them from<br/>\nmentioning it, then it feels like we&#39;ve stopped them from wanting it. But<br/>\nwhat we&#39;ve done is told them they can&#39;t be honest about what they need with<br/>\nus. So they&#39;ll go to someone else or somewhere else. Perhaps someone or<br/>\nsomewhere we&#39;d rather they didn&#39;t go to.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Pornography and teens","postDate":"1042724551","msgId":55304,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2Ny4xYTFmOWZkYi4yYjU4MTBjN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55286,"nextInTopic":55383,"prevInTime":55303,"nextInTime":55305,"topicId":55286,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/15/2003 10:44:33 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
