I like the idea<br/>\nJan Hunt presents because all people need to be treated well whether<br/>\nadult or not.  I would love to be able to think on my feet and<br/>\npractice Hunt&#39;s suggestion but I have to admit I&#39;m very uncomfortable<br/>\nin situations where I feel the need to advocate for children.  It&#39;s<br/>\ntoo easy for me to feel anger above the need(s) of others, and I see<br/>\nthis as my own immaturity at work.  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nKathe, in need of maturity, and all I seem to get is older<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kim J.

Anyway, while we <br/>\nwaited for the place to &quot;officially&quot; open my friends son asked if he <br/>\ncould ride the scooter in the parking lot.  This lady comes marching <br/>\nout with a pamphlet saying, &quot;Welcome&quot; with the most see through, <br/>\nclinched teeth smile and says, &quot;Um, you need to go ahead and put that <br/>\nscooter up, we have ALOT of elderly people that visit here and we do <br/>\nnot want anyone to get hurt.&quot;  There are no &quot;No scooter/skateboard&quot; <br/>\nsigns at this place and it was the parking spot not the sidewalk and <br/>\nno one else was there.  Then my dd was sitting in the hatch part of <br/>\nour car eating a sandwhich and she looks at Brooke and then me and <br/>\nsays, &quot;You need to eat that at the picnic tables, you cannot take food <br/>\ninto the Fort area.&quot;  WTH?!?  She was totally mean, a very grumpy <br/>\nperson and not just disrespectful to the kids but us too.

She&#39;s probably <br/>\nsick of reading baby books.  You guys should be reading to your mom.&quot;  <br/>\nI was pissed.

I say bravely because going into new situations for me  is a <br/>\nbit like going to get a root canal..only worse.

Apparently, two of <br/>\nthe girls were having a problem not following the &quot;tag&quot;  rules.  It seemed  to <br/>\nme, however, that the kids were  working it out.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSuddenly, one of the mom&#39;s stood and marched over to a group of the kids  <br/>\n(Logan was in the group) and just started berating  two girls in a voice  that <br/>\ncould be heard all over the park.  <br/>\nShe said very mean things and used words like &quot;bitching&quot; and I saw Logan  <br/>\njust getting smaller and smaller as he tried to edge away. I don&#39;t know if  <br/>\neither of the girls were her daughter. She went on and on and then proudly came  <br/>\nback to the circle and plopped down as if &quot;her job was done.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s not the first time I had seen a parent behave like this but I think it  <br/>\nmight have been for Logan.

As we <br/>\nwere walking along through a park my dd Sarah, age 6, sat down on a <br/>\nbench and said, &quot;Oh, I am so hungry,&quot; while holding her stomach.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother mother was walking along beside us and said, &quot;Oh, listen to <br/>\nyou, you drama queen.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSarah asked, &quot;What&#39;s a drama queen.&quot;  I tried to explain it the best <br/>\nI could--&quot;like on TV or a show&quot; and I acted it out a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah then became so angry she she stood in the path behind us and <br/>\nbegan to sputter, &quot;Well, I, but, but, but . . .&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other mother looked back at Sarah and said, &quot;I hope you&#39;re not <br/>\nhaving an asthma attack.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI put my arm around Sarah and leaned down and she said, &quot;But I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant her to call me a drama queen.  I don&#39;t want to talk to her <br/>\nanymore.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI said, &quot;You are not a drama queen.  I think she was joking. Now <br/>\nlet&#39;s <br/>\nget back to the car where I have some snacks and drinks.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah said, &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s funny.  I don&#39;t like this joke.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other mother then said, &quot;Oh, I was just joking but I guess it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t funny to you.  I&#39;m sorry.  Can I call you Sleeping Beauty?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah said, &quot;No, just call me Sarah.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other mother then walked on ahead and I tried to explain labels <br/>\nto Sarah.

(Still working on Sandra&#39;s!)  <br/>\nThis other mother opened the book to the part about doing things for <br/>\nkids even when they are able to do for themselves.

My daughter Jessica is very outspoken and loves to take care of<br/>\nchildren younger than her (she&#39;s 10).  We were at Church last night and one of the little 2 year<br/>\nold boys was crying and she way trying to console him and this lady (who by the way is a parapro<br/>\nat public school) said to her &quot;Jessica, if you were in my class at school you would stay in the<br/>\ntimeout chair all of the time until you realized that the adults are in charge.&quot;  THEN, after<br/>\nChurch she brought out a craft that the kids had made and one belonged to my daughter.  I told her<br/>\nthat I thought Jessica was going to get it and she said &quot;That&#39;s what happens when they know their<br/>\nparents will do it for them.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning my little girl said &quot;Mama, I hope she&#39;s not going to be working with the youth all of<br/>\nthe time.&quot;  I had to agree.  By the way (this is not a judgment but fact) this all comes from a<br/>\nwoman who has a daughter who by 21 has already joined the Marines and gotten out on a medical<br/>\ndischargeand has been married and divorced. She has a son who had his license suspended for about<br/>\n6 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am totally not judging because I have three teenage sons and but by the Grace of God go I<br/>\nhowever my boys have thus far been wonderful and guess what, THEY ARE ALL HOMESCHOOLED!<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess I needed a rant.

Can I call you Sleeping Beauty?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah said, &quot;No, just call me Sarah.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other mother then walked on ahead and I tried to explain labels <br/>\nto Sarah.

And how it&#39;s OK to say you are <br/>\nhungry when you are.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny part is this other mother had asked me about the Live and <br/>\nLearn Conference and I had shown her Rue Kream&#39;s book which I had <br/>\nbrought for another friend to read.  (Still working on Sandra&#39;s!)  <br/>\nThis other mother opened the book to the part about doing things for <br/>\nkids even when they are able to do for themselves.

(BTW, her kids are 5, 3 and 1!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis kept me awake last night as I felt that I should have done more <br/>\nto protect Sarah.
