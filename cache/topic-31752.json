Being a single<br/>\n&gt;mother is difficult.  If something ever happened where my children<br/>\n&gt;needed to go to a brick-and-mortar school, I&#39;d use a Sudbury Valley<br/>\n&gt;one too.  And if it helps, I have seen a lot of support for those<br/>\n&gt;parents who want to unschool and who can&#39;t fully because of a spouse&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;objection.  Leaving isn&#39;t always an option and it isn&#39;t always in the<br/>\n&gt;best interest of the child either.  Sometimes it is hard to share <br/>\n&gt;personal information on lists like this but it does help to understand<br/>\n&gt;the specifics for each family.<br/>\n&gt;Cindy Ferguson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>HI Cindy, Actually, most of what I talked about was in theory. Then I <br/>\nspoke of my own personal experience with being a single mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am back in NYC as a family and its most likely a temporary situation. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t like the energy of the area as a place to raise a child. And <br/>\nunschooling is our lifestyle. It always has been since my own childhood. <br/>\nBut I&#39;ve been on a lot of sides of the coin in my varied history and <br/>\nsomehow this has given me insight to a lot of frames of mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo I don&#39;t know the past of some of these people, but I do know some of <br/>\nthem that have posted about non-support and then I can see where they are <br/>\ntorn when trying to move forward.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole flavour was to have patience for those that need to take two <br/>\nsmall steps and then they go three back from internal situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where the support to eachother does come in.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nkolleen<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd personally, I&#39;d choose Sudbury or something similar first, <br/>\nunschooling at home second. My son is a people person. And the best place <br/>\nfor him is to be around groups of people. I can&#39;t give that to him 5 days <br/>\na week.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31663,"nextTopicId":13139}}
