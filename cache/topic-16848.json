That they aren&#39;t learning<br/>\nthe &quot;right&quot; things? Are they complaining that they&#39;re bored? Are you bored?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that helps us is that at the beginning of each month, we<br/>\nperuse the local papers, calendars, homeschooling newsletter, etc. and write<br/>\nout all the possible things that we might want to do on a giant wall<br/>\ncalendar. This might be a local folk dancing time, homeschool hour at the<br/>\nroller-skating rink, story time at the library, a craft workshop, swimming<br/>\nlessons, or whatever - those go up in one color (tentative things). We also<br/>\nwrite up our regular things, like my swim team practice, our weekly<br/>\nhomeschoolers activities (we go to a regular open craft time and park/gym<br/>\nday), those go up in another color because we know we&#39;re definitely going to<br/>\nthem. We add any holidays, doctor&#39;s appointments, etc. in and try to work<br/>\nout any scheduling conflicts (like for activities where I need my husband to<br/>\nhave the kids with him). At this time, we discuss any potential activities<br/>\nthat anyone wants to do (new kinds of lessons or activities) and add those<br/>\nif necessary. Then there is the normal stuff we do - gardening outdoors,<br/>\ngoing to the library, etc. You might have a talk with your kids and see what<br/>\nthings they are interested in doing, or maybe present some things you think<br/>\nmight tickle their fancy. How about volunteer opportunities - these can be a<br/>\ngood free way to get involved and active in some area and your kids are old<br/>\nenough to really participate in something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the &quot;How was school?&quot; question, I personally would be tempted to<br/>\nreply something like &quot;life is learning, we&#39;re living, therefore we&#39;re<br/>\nlearning!&quot;. But I guess it depends on why your husband is asking. Is he not<br/>\nbought into the whole unschooling concept? What are his specific worries?<br/>\nMaybe you can do something like keeping a homeschool journal for a couple of<br/>\nweeks so he can see what your daily activities are like. You can even<br/>\ncategorize them by what &quot;subject area&quot; they might fall under. Like &quot;Biology:<br/>\nspent 45 minutes birdwatching and categorizing birds&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd last but definitely not least - what are your own passions? Follow them,<br/>\npursue them, let your kids see how you go about doing things you&#39;re<br/>\ninterested in. Chances are they will find their own passions to pursue,<br/>\nsooner or later.<br/>\n<br/>\n Blue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;I&#39;m going to puff a bunch of hot air into the<br/>\natmosphere and then it will be spring!&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) the aspiring gymnast<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Kerry Kibort","from":"Kerry Kibort &lt;kkibort@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"FcsHfslWvJoUfWtUO_uZdWLP9fNWTlwu7Wz6G0RVe0ZlgKYwbdE8q4b-dTzR2L9bfVfS2H71NPaiGfHpBvFDD0S7XeQFEAg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] How do you handle laziness, and/or lack of motivation?","postDate":"984147469","msgId":16851,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwMzA5MTQxNzQ5LjkwNDExLnFtYWlsQHdlYjkwMDkubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDEwMzA5MDQyNzU1LkRIUEI0NzYzLm10YTA2Lm9uZWJveC5jb21Ab25lYm94LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":16848,"nextInTopic":16883,"prevInTime":16850,"nextInTime":16852,"topicId":16848,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*I feel so guilty when my husband comes home from work and asks, How was school? and we look at him with blank stares and silence* Tell him you dont go to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1041419910\">*I<br/>\nfeel so guilty when my husband comes home from work<br/>\nand asks, &quot;How was<br/>\nschool?&#39; and we look at him with blank stares and<br/>\nsilence*<br/>\nTell him you dont go to school.
