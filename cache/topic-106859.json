We built marble racetracks out of<br/>\nblocks.  Then he had an idea about using the marble to<br/>\nknock down dominoes so he skittered to his room to get<br/>\nthem.  Then he figured out how to line them up so they<br/>\ncould get knocked down.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater we had a language lesson that he gave on German,<br/>\nSpanish, French and Japanese courtesy of his LeapPad,<br/>\na great trip to the grocery store and &quot;dinner and a<br/>\nmovie&quot; night, watching The Jetsons Movie (which has a<br/>\npretty interesting &#39;responsible<br/>\nbusiness-environment-exploitation&#39; message).  After<br/>\nthat, we went into his room to get ready for bed and<br/>\nhe told me all about the planets and their orbits and<br/>\nran a quiz show for me with multiple choice questions<br/>\nthat he made up (e.g., &quot;The earth&#39;s crust is made of<br/>\na) grass, b) soil, c) bowling balls, or d)<br/>\nelephants&quot;).  We made a glow-in-the-dark mobile of<br/>\nspaceships and astronauts, he read me a book, I read<br/>\nhim a book, he got his favorite lullaby and that was<br/>\nthe day.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I mention that he&#39;s six?  He just astonishes me<br/>\nall the time.  I think that&#39;s what I would love for my<br/>\nhoney, his daddy, to enjoy, too - just the fun of<br/>\nbeing around this sweet little boy who is sunshine in<br/>\nhuman form.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, for all your ideas-<br/>\n<br/>\n(a much-relieved) Kathy<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Pam Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Jun 25, 2005, at 8:08 PM, arcarpenter2003 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; You could even start keeping a journal about your<br/>\n&gt; days, and taking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some pictures to fill it in, if you were so<br/>\n&gt; inclined.

There was a lot<br/>\nof social stuff, too -- he had to make appropriate decisions for the<br/>\ncharacter, and he learned the hard way that he has to think of his<br/>\nteam in this game.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOr &quot;We had a nice little discussion about Japanese food while we were<br/>\nwatching Pokemon this afternoon.  And I could really see him relating<br/>\nwhen Ash didn&#39;t get a badge on his first try.  It was so neat to see<br/>\nhim have a chance to process this stuff in his own comfort zone, here<br/>\nat home.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOr &quot;He&#39;s been having one of those great, totally absorbing days<br/>\nplaying with his cars in his room.  I saw him set up a pretty<br/>\ncomplicated pattern to get them in and out of the bad guys&#39; hideout.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could even start keeping a journal about your days, and taking<br/>\nsome pictures to fill it in, if you were so inclined.  Then you&#39;d have<br/>\nsomething to point to when your husband&#39;s questions caught you off guard.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your husband still translates the above as &quot;just staying home,&quot;<br/>\nthen I might really ask and validate and use all your NVC (non-violent<br/>\ncommunication, if you need to Google it) skills.  Don&#39;t try to defend<br/>\nor argue -- just question and ask for clarification.  Just let him<br/>\ntalk out all his concerns and validate how hard that must be for him.<br/>\n I suspect he&#39;ll talk the wind out of his own sails at some point (if<br/>\nthat analogy works?).<br/>\n<br/>\nI say this because what you said above sounds like the two of you are<br/>\nin a pattern, and he&#39;s pushing back because it&#39;s what he&#39;s supposed to<br/>\ndo.  If you give him nothing to push against, he&#39;ll have to hold his<br/>\nown weight up, so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t mean that you should let him &quot;school&quot; your son.  Again, I<br/>\nwould question and reflect, as nicely as you can, and try to give him<br/>\nthe scoop on some situations before they become issues -- <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Are you asking (a schooly-sounding question) because you&#39;re afraid<br/>\nthat Ellis doesn&#39;t know, or because you honestly wanted to know?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m not sure how Ellis feels, but I&#39;m too tired to talk about the<br/>\nRevolutionary War right now -- I&#39;d rather snuggle and watch SpongeBob.<br/>\n How about you, Ellis?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore they sit down to play the coin game:  &quot;Does it bother you if<br/>\nEllis uses a coin as something other than it is?

Depending on your family<br/>\ndynamics, Ellis can tell his dad how he feels (with you facilitating,<br/>\nif need be), or you can be the messenger.

This question WAS asked by my <br/>\nkid.  I was certainly not perfect in noodging and shushing my husband <br/>\nright in front of my son when the answer kept getting longer and harder <br/>\nto follow.  My husband at least got it half right.  He was answering a <br/>\nspecific question FROM our child.  He paused the video (even tho&#39; it was <br/>\n&quot;educational&quot;! &lt;g&gt;) to make himself more audible.  He attempted to be <br/>\nsimple and concrete in his explanation, even though the subject is <br/>\nabstract and confuses adults.  Where it went off the rails is that when <br/>\nmy son became confused and was trying to express himself &quot;but wait..&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;I think..&quot; or &quot;the way it is (in my head)...&quot;, at that point my husband <br/>\ndidn&#39;t stop trying to put HIS point across.  When getting feedback like <br/>\nthat, I believe it would have been better if my husband had stopped his <br/>\nexposition and listened to the questions and validated or clarified the <br/>\nideas that my son had and then adjusted the rest of his explanation at <br/>\nthat point.  If I hadn&#39;t been right next to him, with my magnifying <br/>\nglass of scrupulous unschooling zeal, probably no regular parent would <br/>\nhave detected a &quot;parenting fault&quot; in the conversation.  The whole <br/>\ndynamic would certainly have been simpler if I hadn&#39;t been sitting right <br/>\nthere, waiting for the video to resume, and highly motivated to butt <br/>\nin.  Even though my husband was trying to be gentle and kind in his <br/>\nexplanation, AND I was trying to be gentle and kind in my butting in <br/>\n(honest!), my son still became distressed and had to go take a bath to <br/>\ncalm down.  At that point we had to admit that ... um... well... <br/>\nparenting errors have been committed on all sides.  While our son was <br/>\nout of the room, dh and I were able to have a calm conversation about <br/>\nthe reality that learning shuts down when people are confused.  But my <br/>\nhusband should get extra points for being willing to attempt confusing <br/>\nanswers.  And I should not try to skate through life with &quot;I can&#39;t <br/>\nexplain it -- go ask your dad&quot; as my strategy of choice.  (A small <br/>\nexaggeration, but those words have passed my lips.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line -- perfection is out there in front of all of us.  We need <br/>\nto believe we can reach it or at least approach it.

This is an hour from where we live and they take them on <br/>\nthe coach. <br/>\nThen her cousin called and is trying to persuade her to do the <br/>\nperforming arts one in London (5/6 hrs away) - as she wants to have <br/>\nsomeone there that she knows (she is 14). I think my dd might like to <br/>\ndo the performing arts one too but feels I&#39;d rather she did the course <br/>\ncloser to home. I suppose my concern is she&#39;s never done anything like <br/>\nthis before (going away with people she doesn&#39;t know) and if she hates <br/>\nit it is nearer for me to pick her up.
