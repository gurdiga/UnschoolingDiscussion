From this it<br/>\nfollows that juggling, horror movies, and serious courses all have equal<br/>\nclaims on students&#39; attention.&quot;<br/>\n(my spell checker says that professoriate is an incorrect spelling - just an<br/>\naside)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/opinion.htm\">http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/opinion.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started unschooling I pretty readily accepted that there was no<br/>\nspecific set of data that we should all have to know.  (I believe this was<br/>\nrecently discussed on this loop).  It is one of the reasons I believe<br/>\ntesting is a complete waste of time.  It is only more recently that I have<br/>\nbegun to question the value of a University education from the point of view<br/>\nof becoming educated rather than as a requirement to enter the job market.<br/>\nIn this article the author states that colleges are &quot;unwilling to say what a<br/>\nsound education might consist of.&quot;  I don&#39;t know how true that statement is<br/>\nbut it raises some interesting questions - at least in my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nJill</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2190,"nextTopicId":2266}}
