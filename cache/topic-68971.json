I think it&#39;d be a lot of fun for kids<br/>\n(and adults) who like to hunt for treasure. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe website address is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocaching.com\">http://www.geocaching.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is her DH typing now =)<br/>\nIt&#39;s a Global Positioning System (GPS) based scavenger hunt.<br/>\nPeople hide &quot;caches&quot; of small items and log the GPS coordinates on the<br/>\nwebsite. Then Geocachers, as they are called, hunt them down. There is<br/>\nusually a small paper log book for people to sign to show they were<br/>\nthere. For example there is a small cache hidden somewhere Krispy<br/>\nKreme in Fresno consisting of a collection of hat pins. People take a<br/>\npin and leave a pin. This looks like alot of fun and could be used as<br/>\nan educational tool (geography, mapping etc.. but shhh don&#39;t tell the<br/>\nkids that). The GPS units are available at almost any sporting goods<br/>\nstore for under $100. They are not necessary for the hunt but it looks<br/>\nreally hard to do without one. OK back to my wife...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, my DH now looks for the &quot;educational tool&quot; in<br/>\neverything that we do now. :) I caught myself wishing that our DD<br/>\nwas old enough to &quot;play.&quot; But....who says we can&#39;t do it anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy hunting,<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68935,"nextTopicId":68917}}
