Like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAround me, though, were parents making all kinds of dire predictions  <br/>\nand threats about how vital school was and that homeschoolers would  <br/>\nnever get a job, or that homeschooling was the only way and school  <br/>\nwas out to destroy children so the kids HAD to do the &#39;schoolwork&#39;  <br/>\nthe parents were assigning, or else they&#39;d have to go back to school,  <br/>\nor that the kids HAD to do the reading lessons the parents were  <br/>\nassigning, or they would turn out like Holly Dodd, unable to read at  <br/>\nthe age of ten.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn those cases, tensions were high, and the tensions were created by  <br/>\nthe parents making such narrow and absolute (and ultimately  <br/>\nthreatening) statements.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad they balanced a little more lightly in their stance so that  <br/>\nmotion one way or the other hadn&#39;t toppled them (or more literally,  <br/>\nmade them look like liars or indecisive parents), they could have  <br/>\nmore easily accepted it when Holly read so well so quickly once she  <br/>\ndid read.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took conscious thought for me to make my children my priority.  It  <br/>\nwould have been simple, from examples all around me in real life,  <br/>\nmedia, political chit-chat, for me to focus on career, or money, or  <br/>\nhouse-as-investment, any of which would have made the kids small  <br/>\nparts of MY life, heirs in the wings who needed to be persuaded not  <br/>\nto mar my investment property, not to need me during business hours,  <br/>\nand ALL those things that are commonly accepted by some-to-many others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t really help that others are using my kids as good examples or  <br/>\nbad examples, but I can continue to examine my own statements and  <br/>\nmessages to them and try to make sure I&#39;m not using other people&#39;s  <br/>\nkids as good or bad examples, but rather helping them see the range  <br/>\nof life with its upsides and downsides.   It&#39;s not as easy as it  <br/>\nmight seem, and for me it does take conscious decision-making  <br/>\nthought.

I didn&#39;t even want them to SEE that &quot;godly&quot; behavior when  <br/>\nthey were little, and so I couldn&#39;t begin to associate our family  <br/>\nwith those groups.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Respecting all people equally&quot; is the same as respecting nobody  <br/>\nwhatsoever.<br/>\nBeing &quot;completely nonjudgmental&quot; is the same as not knowing better  <br/>\nfrom worse.<br/>\nAnd I&#39;ve found many who coo about how wonderful it is to be  <br/>\nnonjudgmental, and turns out they really hate judgmental people. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nSo those who claim to accept everything are some of the first to get  <br/>\nmad at me for saying &quot;Really?
