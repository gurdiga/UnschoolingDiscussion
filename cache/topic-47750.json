Iguanas will get huge eventually given enough room and a good diet, but if you keep them in smaller cages they will stay smaller longer, sometimes forever. For example, the one we had was 5 years old and only about 18 inches long, he had been kept in a 30 gallon aquarium for his entire life. My uncle has a 2 yr old one that is now well over 3 feet long, he built a 6 ft high cage that was 3&#39;x3&#39;, and put in 4 levels I believe, and a tree branch. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what you&#39;d call the cage. I got the bird-cage part when we bought the hamsters, then added the other pieces on from stuff bought at Wal-Mart. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: james e thomas <br/>\n  could it have been salmonella? I did hear that iguanas continue to grow<br/>\n  all of their lives so in a number of years you could be purchasing a<br/>\n  cattle tank (like for water) to keep it in. I thought that perhaps a pet<br/>\n  that didn&#39;t get so big would be better. A ferret, sugar glider, a dog (of<br/>\n  course not a great dane *grin*).<br/>\n    your cage sounds like a habitrail....they are really neat. hamsters<br/>\n  seem to be more watching pets than handling ones.<br/>\n    <br/>\n  sharon<br/>\n<br/>\n  ________________________________________________________________ <br/>\n  Sign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today <br/>\n  Only $9.95 per month! <br/>\n  Visit www.juno.com<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I THINK I remember that the biggest risk of it came from their droppings, and they are the biggest risk for children under the age of 4. They usually freak out when you first get them, it takes them about a week to settle in. After that, if you put your hands in the cage as often as possible, he&#39;ll get used to you very quickly. They can tell the difference between different people, so everyone in the family will need to do this. They are a joy to own!!! I&#39;ve had two. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I&#39;m sorry, I asked Tyler, and he wants us to keep the hamster stuff for his next little fuzzy critter. We looked at the guinea pigs, but they were too big for his taste. We had the miniature (dwarf?) hamsters before, and he doesn&#39;t want anything bigger than they were. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  My son would love an iguana....what have you heard about  not being in a<br/>\n  family with small children? how small is small?
