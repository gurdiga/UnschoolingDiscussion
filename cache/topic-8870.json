However this does make a tremendous difference in <br/>\nchildren when you are fighting to prevent other allergies.  The chemicals in <br/>\nour foods and environment attach to the IGA and IGE in your body (the <br/>\nantibodies that fight the allergens) and then together begin an attack on <br/>\nother substances consumed.  I can&#39;t put it into precise words, but the <br/>\nchemicals are obviously VERY BAD and cause our bodies to respond differently <br/>\nto highly allergenic foods.  Remember when we were kids and there were not <br/>\nthat many people with food allergies?  And with only a few allergies at a <br/>\ntime for the most part?  Do you notice the difference with our children?  <br/>\nThere are tons more highly allergenic children now as compared to even 25 <br/>\nyears ago.  Hmm, I think it has to do a lot with the chemicals consumed!  <br/>\nThe chemicals are much harder on a little child&#39;s body than on an <br/>\nadult...not to say it&#39;s good for adults!  Yes, we do homeopathy, <br/>\nchiropractor, nutritionist, and I read, read, read!!! Currently avoidance of <br/>\nthe allergenic foods, supplements, flax seed meal, vitamin E and C and <br/>\norganic foods has helped us tremendously.  Both boys have not added any more <br/>\nallergies to their list!  Yay! I can relate to your husband&#39;s asthma...it <br/>\nruns rampid throughout our family and this is what I am fighting to keep my <br/>\nsons from getting.  I have read a lot about the &quot;asthma march&quot; that starts <br/>\nwith simple food or environment allergies and then turns into asthma.  Sorry <br/>\nto ramble, just thought you&#39;d like to know the organic scoop!<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8868,"nextTopicId":8873}}
