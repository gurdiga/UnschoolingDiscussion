Didn&#39;t think it would be too graphic or anything, well,  the opening scene has Robin in a prison where hands are being cut off,,,oops.    My son walks away disgusted,   &quot;I hate movies like this...&quot;  I really thought he would like the adventure part of it.    He loves LOTR and Star Wars.      I was really struggling.   Struck out again...<br/>\nMy dd and I watched it,       I talked with Alec about it later,   from what I can figure,  is that Robin Hood was more real?   LOTR  is more make believe?    I guess that makes sense.   He&#39;ll watch  Matrix and stuff like that , Terminator,   blow em up stuff like that,  but can&#39;t watch Robin Hood?        <br/>\nA day later my dd wanted to watch it again,  she likes to listen closer and get the dialogue better.   So  my ds and I were going to play a game.   (In the same room)  he was fine with that.     As the movie went on he really got into it,   but the real people in and such must really be too much for him.<br/>\n <br/>\nThen,  yesterday we watched Wild America,  loved it,  but,  boy there are some intense scenes in that.    With the aligators  or when they are going in a cave,    had to shut it off my daughter was stressing out.    (Yet she had no problem with the hands being cut off or seeing the Orcs in LOTR)  We did end up watching it all but we had to give it a pause.  Get some popcorn,  that kind-of thing.            So,  its very interesting how different things affect us. <br/>\nI know when I was in high school I was standing in a the walk way of a mall. Watching an excerpt from Friday the 13th,  mid day, people walking all around me, they had it on in a video rental place.   I almost fainted when Jason came out of a lake at some kids in a boat.<br/>\nCan you imagine me in the theater with one of those?         But I&#39;ll watch Robin Hood and LOTR and such,  no problem....<br/>\n <br/>\nI think we&#39;ll all be OK going to the Piglet movie,  whew.....<br/>\n <br/>\nKelli<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

She&#39;s 17 and from a very young age liked the bloody scary movies. I<br/>\nremember when she was very young, before a year old, she liked watching<br/>\nwrestling with her dad. I thought it was kind of strange for a baby to watch<br/>\nlike she did, especially that. It wasn&#39;t like every day but when it was on<br/>\nshe watched. When she was 3 and 4 she would stay up with me and watch<br/>\nArsenio Hall and Trapper John MD. She also like Sesame Street and Care Bears<br/>\nand Smurfs and such too. Along with Jaws and Robocop!<br/>\nShe never got scared, I always watched with her and talked about stuff and<br/>\neven stopped movies to answer questions or whatever. I didn&#39;t find it<br/>\nexcessive or obsessive with her. She liked so many other things besides<br/>\nscary movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe still has no problems now with scary movies. She likes just about all<br/>\nkinds. She does jump and scream now when she watches something very tense<br/>\nand unexpectedly scary. She never did that when she was younger. She&#39;s not a<br/>\nviolent person and she&#39;s not scared of much, well except for bugs. They&#39;ll<br/>\nsend her screaming into the night in a heartbeat!!!

She<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t watch for long but she did make it through the whole Piglet movie<br/>\nlast week. Her first movie too. The trick was to keep feeding her! Worked at<br/>\nthe circus! Her tv attention span is at the most 20 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph (8) and Sierra (7) love dinosaur, shark, gator and bug movies. In<br/>\nfact today Joseph was watching Orkin bug movies I sent away  for free!!!<br/>\nJoseph will say he doesn&#39;t want anything too scary. So far he hasn&#39;t asked<br/>\nto see anything that has been too much for him. He doesn&#39;t ask to see Jason<br/>\nor Freddy type movies. He likes Die Hard and action stuff. He&#39;ll also watch<br/>\nmedical shows with me too. Sierra watches about the same as he does. Joseph<br/>\ngets a little antsy if the romance gets a bit heated but so far nothing to<br/>\ngraphic that way.

Of course, the &quot;magic <br/>\npower necklace&quot; was the chain and dog tags from Maverick&#39;s <br/>\nfriend &quot;Goose&quot; who died, and there was a scene where he takes the <br/>\nchain out and looks at it and rubs his thumb over it.

Wanting to post something but not having the time to put my thoughts down.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to communicate to people who restrict these things that there is so much more to this than meets the eye.  I used to also feel the same way,  I did not see the value in certain TV shows or movies.   I would not miss TV or certain types of movies if I didn&#39;t see them.    But I am now at a different place.    If they want to watch TV they can,  if a movie comes along that they want to watch they can.<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the issue isn&#39;t me.... its my kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n        I figured out which shows I wanted to watch and which shows I didn&#39;t want to.  How did I do that?  By watching.  Not by my mother saying,  &quot;you don&#39;t need to watch that,  that&#39;s crap&quot;.    I pretty much had free reign to TV.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNow my kids watch TV,  they watch Johnny Bravo, they watch DragonballZ,  they watch Tom and Jerry,  all the stuff they&#39;ve never seen before.        And you know what?  When I&#39;ve watched it with them, opened my mind up,  I&#39;ve totally had a new experience.   I&#39;m doing it for them and they open up to me.    <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIts just another avenue in which we can be a family.  In which we can build our relationship.  Yes there are commercials,  yes there is alot of &#39;stuff&#39; there, but we end up talking about it.   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTV will always be in our world,  movies too.   I can&#39;t keep things from them.  I choose to live my children&#39;s lives with them;   experiencing the world as it is and seeing it through their eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI know for alot of people who are new to these ideas it doesn&#39;t make sense,  its just doesn&#39;t jive with what you feel is important.    <br/>\n<br/>\nBut just try and open up,  try and see that everyone learns in different ways, maybe from a TV show, maybe from a gameboy or Playstation.   We don&#39;t know unless we let them give it a try.  All things have value even if its mindless drivel to you right now.  Let that go,  try and see it differently.  This unschooling life can be so rich,  its so amazing.   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep reading these posts,  play with your kids,  live life with your kids.    Eventually,  if you allow it,  this will make sense.

For instance, my son might not have any problem watching a <br/>\nmovie with a lot of blood and battle scenes like &#39;Gettysburg&#39;, but he <br/>\nwould be totally freaked out by the scene in &#39;The Bear&#39; where the <br/>\nbaby bear&#39;s mother is killed by a falling rock, or the cruelty that <br/>\nthe men show toward the baby bear, keeping him tied up and taunting <br/>\nhim. My son gets very upset about animals being hurt. Sometimes I&#39;m <br/>\nreally surprised by what will bother him in a movie. Both of my kids <br/>\nfound the movie &quot;ET&quot; very disturbing because of the way the children <br/>\ntreated each other and the fact that the adults were very detached <br/>\nfrom their kids and left them alone. They were really upset when the <br/>\nmother left the little girl alone in the house. They were also very <br/>\nupset by the little robot being blown off of the spaceship in the <br/>\nmovie Silent Running. It either didn&#39;t register or didn&#39;t bother them <br/>\nthat one adult human murders a couple of others in the same movie, <br/>\nbut they cried about that robot for a week and found it very <br/>\ndisturbing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo ratings aren&#39;t as helpful as really knowing what kinds of things <br/>\nmight scare or bother them, and talking with them frankly about what <br/>\nis in a particular movie and what might be problematic for them. In <br/>\nthe examples above, the things that bothered them were not things <br/>\nthat could be predicted by movie ratings or level of violence or <br/>\ngraphic language or any other arbitrary indicator. It&#39;s things within <br/>\ntheir own personality and experience that make some movies fine and <br/>\nothers disturbing. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll see &quot;Spiderman&quot; before they&#39;d <br/>\never want to watch &quot;Dumbo&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8226888,"authorName":"the_clevengers","from":"&quot;the_clevengers&quot; &lt;diamondair@...&gt;","profile":"the_clevengers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: movie restrictions","postDate":"1049128130","msgId":62510,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI2OXFjMithZmNkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyOC4yNmMwODBjZi4yYmI5YmM2MUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62506,"nextInTopic":62515,"prevInTime":62509,"nextInTime":62511,"topicId":62506,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... to ... thought and ... decide.

The first time they watched <br/>\nit, they asked me to fast-forward past parts they thought were too <br/>\nscary. After a few times of doing this, and after watching all the <br/>\ndocumentaries that showed how the scary orcs were created, they were <br/>\nfine with watching the whole thing. Now they both want to see the Two <br/>\nTowers, and my oldest wanted to see it in the theatre. I told him I <br/>\nwould go and check it out and tell him what I thought. After seeing <br/>\nit, I told him that I thought it wasn&#39;t as scary as the first one (it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have as many &quot;gotcha&quot; scenes), but that I thought with the <br/>\nsound and large screen, he might feel very overwhelmed seeing it in a <br/>\ntheatre and might find it too scary. He thought about it for awhile <br/>\nand decided to wait to see it on DVD. I think part of the reason that <br/>\nhe felt comfortable making that decision is that he trusts me to give <br/>\nhim accurate information based on his responses to previous movies. <br/>\nHe knows that I&#39;m not saying &quot;You can&#39;t watch this because it&#39;s too <br/>\nfreaky&quot; but that I&#39;m trying to give him the most accurate picture <br/>\npossible of what he can expect. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not really any different than what I&#39;d do for my husband. He has <br/>\na hard time with a lot of suspense/horror movies. I watched &quot;The <br/>\nSixth Sense&quot; first, and told him what he could expect and that I <br/>\nthought he&#39;d really like it but it had a few &quot;gotcha&quot; parts and I&#39;d <br/>\ntell him when they are coming up. OTOH, he will never, ever want to <br/>\nsee &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; and has told me to go ahead and see it on <br/>\nmy own. Being freaked out by certain kinds of movies is not limited <br/>\nto children. Helping give good factual information, whether to my <br/>\nhusband or to my kids, is respecting them *and* helping them decide <br/>\nwhether they can handle any particular movie. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe hardest time I have is when my kids want to see something that I <br/>\ntotally have no interest in seeing. If they rent it on DVD, that&#39;s <br/>\none thing, but if I have to sit through it in a theatre, that&#39;s <br/>\nanother. Making it through the Veggie Tales Jonah movie was a real <br/>\ntrial! DH fell asleep, but I thought at least one of us should stay <br/>\nawake and make sure our 3 y.o. didn&#39;t wander out of the theatre.
