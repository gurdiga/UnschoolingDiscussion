She says that had they spent his teen years trying to work on math <br/>\nskills, he likely wouldn&#39;t have been as interested in or had the time for the <br/>\npursuits that enabled him to score well on the verbal portion - with the result <br/>\nthat he would have had mediocre scores in both areas and been much less <br/>\nattractive to the college he wanted to attend. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: From unschooling to college?","postDate":"1104422853","msgId":101914,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVBMkM4NjAwLTVBN0MtMTFEOS1BNzlFLTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0OC4zYWZiZDhiMy4yZjA1NWQyZkBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE0OC4zYWZiZDhiMy4yZjA1NWQyZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":101907,"nextInTopic":101946,"prevInTime":101913,"nextInTime":101915,"topicId":101880,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Also -  Opportunities After High School : Thoughts, Documents, Resources, by Wes Beach.
