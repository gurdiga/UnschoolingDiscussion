This could be the Dalmatian influence.<br/>\nHe has always been great with kids, lots of fun, but quite challenging,<br/>\nbecause he is not as easily trainable as some dogs. I think this is a sign<br/>\nof intelligence, he sneaks around and does what he wants, but  he only does<br/>\nforbidden things when he thinks I am not looking; for example, stand at the<br/>\ncounter and pick out what he would like to eat, or open doors with his nose.<br/>\nHe has a fondness for garbage despite the Tabasco, pepper, and all the<br/>\ntricks that are suppose to discourage him. He has ruined our new carpet,<br/>\ndoors, shoes, furniture, but he is still around, and I am glad.<br/>\nWendy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29707,"nextTopicId":29638}}
