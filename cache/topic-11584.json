There is a key to each <br/>\nchild and unfortunatley we often don&#39;t have enough interaction with <br/>\nfellow human beings as children to learn this fact before we have <br/>\nchildren of our own.   With small families isolated from extended <br/>\nfamily, two parents off to work, kids in daycare where they are <br/>\ntaught from an early age to CONFORM and be alike it is becoming <br/>\nmore and more difficult for kids to be themselves and to develope <br/>\ntheir unique personality in good ways.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d better stop rambling now, there&#39;s hay to stack in the barn!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSue<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Winona Farm in Minnesota Welcomes Unschoolers All Year Round<br/>\nMy website:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e\">http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e</a><br/>\nFarm website:    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/\">http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/</a><br/>\nFarm newsletter: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To believe in something, and not to live it,<br/>\n is to be dishonest.&quot;   -Mahatma Gandhi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NumoAstro@aol.com","from":"NumoAstro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Rn9hlPBiiCSn7yR-uGt1BBOjIRRJpb-zVLEDJcPR1iy9PpuBe9kICNqp30IFIzTXUW4vEIYUJ2c","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Sassy Kids","postDate":"964877246","msgId":11586,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM2Ljg5YjE0MmIuMjZiNDM1YmVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11585,"nextInTopic":11624,"prevInTime":11585,"nextInTime":11587,"topicId":11584,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just thought I d point out that boredom is anger spread thin..

One of the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-827477900\">Hi Annette:<br/>\n<br/>\nWow what a handful and a challenge you have.  It&#39;s been a challenge with Zak, <br/>\nwhose quite energetic, to stick to some ground rules.  One of the first <br/>\nthings I learned is consistency, consistency, consistency.... We don&#39;t answer <br/>\nZak if he shouts from another room.  We&#39;ve talked about this rule before.  If <br/>\nhe wants me to do something for him he has to come to me.  We do the same for <br/>\nhim though, we don&#39;t shout across rooms for him to come to us.  This way we <br/>\nmodel the behavior we want.  Zak has choices and consequences and now he&#39;s 5 <br/>\nhe understands what that means.  I try to make the consequences natural but <br/>\nsometimes there are none.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe use 1-2-3 as well and that has worked very well with him.  If he wants a <br/>\ncookie and a baloon when we go to the grocery store then he needs to follow <br/>\nthe 3 rules for good behavior in the store, which are holding or standing <br/>\nnext to the cart, no running away and only picking up items when I tell him <br/>\notherwise he doesn&#39;t get the cookie and baloon.  And I stick to it... It only <br/>\ntook him a couple of times to learn I meant it.<br/>\n<br/>\nZak&#39;s just started this PLEASE MUM, PLEASE MUM, PLEASE MUM when I&#39;ve already <br/>\nanswered the question.  I just ignore the please and change the subject by <br/>\nasking him something else to distract him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving friends over is a priviledge and mabye some leverage you could use <br/>\nwith his behavior.  Figure out what you want him to do and then use the <br/>\nthings he wants as leverage.  I know it sounds manipulating but it&#39;s not.  If <br/>\nyou want him to clean up his room then it&#39;s simple.  &quot;When you clean up your <br/>\nroom then BLANK can come over to play&quot;  &quot;When you take the dog for a walk <br/>\nthen you can BLANK&quot; whatever it is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that for us it was so much easier to give him what he wanted and then <br/>\nwe realized we were not doing him any favors.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalling me or hubbie names is an absolute no, no and then things he loves get <br/>\ntaken away.  His Thomas Train track has been in a time out for up to 3 days <br/>\nat one time, when he was in preschool and called me a name.  That way he knew <br/>\nhow serious I was.  Soon stopped that behavior.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned to detach myself from feeling bad for him if he has <br/>\ninappropriate behavior because he obviously doesnt&#39; feel bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also do lots and lots of praize... Lots of catching him doing something <br/>\ngood.  If I walk through the living room and he&#39;s not pushing his baby <br/>\nbrother over I tell him &quot;Wow you are playing so nicely with Max, you must be <br/>\nso proud of yourself&quot;... or &quot;I see how kind you are being to your baby <br/>\nbrother and I&#39;m very impressed with your behaviour&quot;.  Yes it&#39;s much harder <br/>\nwork to do that, but in the long run I believe it will payoff.  We are <br/>\nalready seeing the results with Zak, who would be like your boys if he had <br/>\nhis way.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11616,"nextTopicId":11553}}
