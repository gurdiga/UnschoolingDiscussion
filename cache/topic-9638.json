I went to my library this morning and talked to the Branch<br/>\n&gt; Manager who was wonderful..  I told her there were no books on unschooling<br/>\n&gt; and 7 on homeschooling and she asked me if I could suggest some. She said<br/>\n&gt; they had plenty of money in their budget for those books.  I quickly whipped<br/>\n&gt; out my copy of The Unschooling Handbook and she ordered it from Amazon.com as<br/>\n&gt; we were talking.  She asked me if there were anymore I could recommend.  I<br/>\n&gt; could only think of the Colfax&#39;s book and didn&#39;t know if that was unschooling<br/>\n&gt; or homeschooling.  Anyway she ordered that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I told her about the unschooling loop and she asked me to ask you for<br/>\n&gt; recommendations of unschooling books.
