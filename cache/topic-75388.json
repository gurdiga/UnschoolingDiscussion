He had severe cystic acne and his back<br/>\nwas badly scarred and bumpy. (It still is, and he&#39;s over 40.)  He feels<br/>\nthe acne has really blighted his life.  As an adult experimenting with<br/>\nimproving his nutrition he has recently given up drinking milk and feels<br/>\nthat this is healthier for him.  (I&#39;d ask him for more info, but it&#39;s<br/>\ntoo early to call him this morning.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an adult my mom consistenly gets diarrhea from eating dairy products,<br/>\nand I sometimes do which somewhat supports the idea that my brother has<br/>\na physical response to dairy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8151304,"authorName":"rubyprincesstsg@aol.com","from":"rubyprincesstsg@...","profile":"rubyprincesstsg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: dairy, was re: eczema OT","postDate":"1056552778","msgId":75472,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUuMzI0ODQ2YjkuMmMyYjExNGFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":75456,"nextInTopic":75479,"prevInTime":75471,"nextInTime":75473,"topicId":75388,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/25/2003 9:41:28 AM Eastern Daylight Time, sheran@ptd.net ...

It <br/>\nLOOKS just like any acne, and they aren&#39;t those really huge red swollen <br/>\nobviously infected spots.  Just your run of the mill acne not even what I would <br/>\nconsider really bad acne, compared to some of their friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was found quite by accident when during a particularly bad (for him) break <br/>\nout he was also put on antibiotics for strep throat.  By the time the <br/>\nantibiotics were gone there wasn&#39;t a trace of acne, not for many weeks after.  We <br/>\ndidn&#39;t really get the connection of the antibiotics until probably almost a year <br/>\nlater when he had a pretty bad break out (and he gets it on his back and <br/>\nface), he seems to think when he sweats a lot, like during baseball season, he gets <br/>\nlots of breakouts.  He&#39;s also extra tired during this time and extra busy and <br/>\nseems to always get strep at the end of the season.  Once again antibiotics <br/>\n(which I am NOT suggesting that you take just for acne but saying it appears <br/>\nwith my children at least that their is a component of infection involved) <br/>\ncompletely cleared up all acne on his face and back.  My older son tucked that <br/>\nthought away and he tells me when he gets a bad break out he takes antibiotics and <br/>\nit goes right away.  Instead of just traditional antibiotics prescribed by a <br/>\ndoctor, I know there are many other remedies that could suit this purpose.  <br/>\nMaybe an antibacterial soap instead of the specialized acne soap?  I know there <br/>\nare probably lots of other things that you all have tried successfully and I&#39;m <br/>\nanxious to hear your replies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso one other thing, have any of you with teenagers noticed your child that <br/>\nhas relatively clear skin but occasional breakouts gets more breakouts if they <br/>\nare dating a girl/boy with severe acne?  I don&#39;t think this is possible but <br/>\none son was dating a girl with just horrible acne and her parents would do <br/>\nnothing about it, he ALWAYS got really bad acne when he was with her (nothing to <br/>\ndo with eating the same foods, etc.) I bought her some skin cleansers and acne <br/>\nremedies and she cleared up some, he cleared up a lot.  Later when she had <br/>\nused all the products and was back with the horrible acne, he got it pretty bad <br/>\nagain.  When he stopped dating her, he gets a couple minor outbreaks a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t make sense to me unless it is some kind of infection based and that <br/>\nwith their heads umm lips and such always together it was spread.  I watched <br/>\nthat for about two years and always wondered if anyone else noticed anything <br/>\nsimilar?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did the dermatologist say?  He said a certain type of acne does react to <br/>\nantibiotics and a good dermatologist will use antibiotics before prescribing <br/>\nsome of the very harsh medications for acne, many times it works.  I asked <br/>\nabout &quot;spreading it&quot; he said infection travels, germs intermingle, it happens <br/>\nwith teenagers.

My 13 yr old is the only one of<br/>\nher friends with bad skin (not super bad, but persistent). She eats ok,<br/>\nloves milk, has never had allergies or other skin problems. It&#39;s also<br/>\nprobably genetic too, since I was the same. I am resistant to taking her to<br/>\na dermatologist, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll take any other suggestions also.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nPaula</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"dairy, was re: eczema OT","postDate":"1056491161","msgId":75388,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGMwMWMzM2E5YSQyODVjMDY0MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGJkYWNkZCthcmc4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDA0NDAxYzMzYTkyJGI0OTM2MmEwJDYxMDFhOGMwQGxhdW5jaG1vZGVtLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":75448,"prevInTime":75387,"nextInTime":75389,"topicId":75388,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... the dairy industry is a big money maker...for political figures especially.

The<br/>\nmeat and dairy industries lobbied to flip it over, because they did NOT want<br/>\npeople to think that grains, fruits, and vegetables (as shown at the top of<br/>\nthe pyramid) are more important than dairy and meat.  Hmm.  The USDA is<br/>\ncurrently revising their recomendations, again.  I have a copy of one of my<br/>\nmom&#39;s books from nurses training in the 50&#39;s.  Back then the pyramid was<br/>\nlike a wheel.  Eggs and ice cream daily, but also citrus and leafy greens<br/>\ndaily.  USDA keeps searching for a way to give the public simple but<br/>\nhealthful dietary recomendations.  Meanwhile our groceries are full of<br/>\nplenty of not so nutritious foods to choose from.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very difficult to &quot;prove&quot; theories on food and nutrition.  It is hard<br/>\nto find subjects who will follow very specific diets 100%, and even then the<br/>\nexperiments just can&#39;t continue long term.  Even then, there are so many<br/>\nother factors that impact health - genetics, environment, exercise, mental<br/>\nhealth, proximity to pollution, and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnecdotal evidence of how people feel when they change their diet or other<br/>\nhabits means something, but it simply cannot prove that one factor will<br/>\nresult in the same change in all people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have many concerns about the handling and processing of foodstuff.<br/>\nChemicals, colors, high-tech processing, food that is old by the time it<br/>\nreaches the consumer, yada, yada.  Yes, people need to inform themselves<br/>\nfrom more than one source.  Unfortunately, many people never have the chance<br/>\nto learn to trust their own bodies and easily become victims of the latest<br/>\ndietary fads.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75487,"nextTopicId":75588}}
