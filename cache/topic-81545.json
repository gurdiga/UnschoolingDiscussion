He watches any bird <br/>\nprograms on TV that he can, he gets magazines, and we go &quot;birding&quot; <br/>\nquite often, armed with bird books.  He was thrilled to see his first <br/>\npelican in South Carolina this August when we visited Charleston <br/>\nbefore the conference (and then we had a &quot;debate&quot; over which kind of <br/>\npelican it was, and he was right, of course...it was a brown pelican, <br/>\nthe only pelican that dives for fish).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we do fall kayak trips on our river, their main purpose is <br/>\nbirding, as on the Delaware River (where we have our cabin), we see <br/>\nbald eagles, osprey, great egrets, great blue herons, kingfishers, <br/>\ngeese, merganzer ducks, and, our all-time favorite, the green heron <br/>\n(that bird is SO cool!) (last weekend, we saw a bear swimming across <br/>\nthe river!).<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year for Jake&#39;s birthday, we went hiking in the birding trails <br/>\nat Cornell&#39;s Sapsucker Woods sanctuary.  That was great.

Pelicans, and great blue herons. Saw some swans<br/>\none spring. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best backyard birds, IMO, are the pine siskins. They are bold,<br/>\neven staying with a feeder while my daughter crept up beneath them,<br/>\nand actually was able to touch one before it darted off. They eat the<br/>\nsame things as goldfinches, and loved our upside-down feeder we had a<br/>\ncouple of years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year, our biggy was the hummingbirds. At times we had more than a<br/>\ndozen fighting over our front yard feeder...wonderful evening<br/>\nentertainment. They aren&#39;t ruby throated, but I *think* rufous sided<br/>\nhummingbirds. And my favorite, the blacl capped chickadee, won&#39;t even<br/>\ncome near the place. I&#39;ve scattered seed (the juncos love that) and<br/>\nput out tray feeders and such...nope. they stick close to the spruce<br/>\ntrees. <br/>\n<br/>\nsuch a cool activity. I love birds!<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, heidiC<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Julie Bogart&quot;<br/>\n&lt;julie@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I just have to effuse a bit about birds.

We went to the Columbia River today, to splash around in the warm September sun.  One of the first things we saw was a group of geese.  Lisa said it was a family.  I disagreed at first, but as we observed them, we noticed that there were two that were distinctly different from the other 6.  We spent a while pointing out the details so we could look them up later.  She went off somewhere else after the park, and I can&#39;t find these in my bird book!  The adults had black bill & eyes, dark &quot;stripe&quot; down back of neck & dirty white in front.  The male had a black protuberance at the top of his beak with an orange mark at the top and white stripe between the bill and his face.  Under his neck there was a bulge that resembled an Adams apple or that thing under a turkey&#39;s neck.  The young all had orange bills tipped with white and orange circles around black eyes.  Their necks had a variegated pattern, but were also slightly darker on the back of the neck than the front.  All had orange feet and white rumps.  They looked similar to the greater white-fronted goose, but not exactly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI let the kids jump off the new dock today.  I&#39;m a bit paranoid near the river, as it runs swiftly and is often murky.  The water today was clear.  After a while the kids decided to swim from the dock to the shore (not very far).  We&#39;d brought a neighbor boy. He got scared the last yard, but Lisa was there in the water and reached out to him.  I thought it was interesting because he has had swimming lessons every year for the last 4 years.  My girls took one session of swim lessons 3 years ago, but have had lots of opportunity to just be in the water.  Mine are more confident and better swimmers than he is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CRU92/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CRU92/</a><br/>\nUnschoolers in Tri-Cities<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81639,"nextTopicId":81632}}
