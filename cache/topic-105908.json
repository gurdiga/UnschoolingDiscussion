Anderson&#39;s chapter 5,  &quot;Old Languages, New <br/>\nModels&quot; probably touches most specifically on his idea of print <br/>\ncapitalism&#39;s impact on nationalism.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a little blurb about it, though I think it makes it sound very <br/>\ndry and boring--much too academic-speak for my taste, shame:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The close of the era of successful national liberation movements in the <br/>\nAmericas coincided with the onset of the age of nationalism in Europe. <br/>\nThese &#39;&#39;new nationalisms&#39;&#39; were different in two respects: 1.) national <br/>\nprint languages were of central ideological and political importance, <br/>\nand 2.) the nation became something capable of being consciously aspired <br/>\nto from early on due to the &#39;&#39;models&#39;&#39; set forth by the Creole pioneers. <br/>\nVernacular print capitalism is important to class formation, <br/>\nparticularly the rise of the bourgeoisie. Prior to this, solidarities <br/>\nwere the products of kinship, clientship, and personal loyalties. The <br/>\nbourgeoisie, however, achieved solidarities on an imaginary basis <br/>\nthrough print capitalism. That is, they didn&#39;t know one another because <br/>\nof marriage or proper transactions, but because they came to visualize <br/>\nothers like themselves through print. The nobility then were potential <br/>\nconsumers of the philological revolution. As soon as the events of the <br/>\nAmericas reached the European nobility through print, the imagined <br/>\nrealities of nation-states became models for Europe. &quot; (source: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/socsja/SPCnotes/Anderson.html\">http://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/socsja/SPCnotes/Anderson.html</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a review that paints a better picture, I think:<br/>\n&quot;Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and <br/>\nSpread of Nationalism - This is the book that most history students <br/>\nventuring into the study of either cultural history or nationalism are <br/>\nall assigned to read. It also happens to be fairly interesting, <br/>\nwell-written and rather useful. The premise is that communities cannot <br/>\nbe created by simply drawing some borders and declaring a nation, they <br/>\nmust be imagined, or understood by those people who are part of them. In <br/>\norder for a nation of people to feel like a nation they have to see <br/>\nthemselves as somehow similiar and connected to other people in that <br/>\nnation, no matter how far away or strange they may be. Anderson outlines <br/>\nthe many ways in which this can be achieved through language, the <br/>\nreading of newspapers, national holidays, the development of roads and <br/>\ncities and even though symbols and clothing. This is well worth the time <br/>\nif you&#39;re interested in constructions of the social, the development of <br/>\nnationalism or the creation of the modern nation state.&quot; (source: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reviewcentre.com/review150107.html\">http://www.reviewcentre.com/review150107.html</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a lot of time right now, with getting the house ready to <br/>\nsell and all, but I&#39;m sure you could get a copy of the book at the UNM <br/>\nlibrary and just xerox the relevent chapter. Some scribbled notes I have <br/>\nin the margins for that chapter are: &quot;rise of dictionaries and <br/>\nphilology, expansion of linguistic study, discovery of other ancient <br/>\nlanguages participated in the leveling of great Western languages, open <br/>\nfield of comparison with travel, impact of exploration, entrance of <br/>\ncomparative critique, print created a &quot;thing&quot; out of revolution and <br/>\nprovided a model for other revolutions, coinciding of nation with <br/>\nnational languages, rise of the bourgeoisie depended upon print and <br/>\nimagination, coalition readerships.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that&#39;s somewhat helpful.
