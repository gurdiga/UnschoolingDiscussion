I guess","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-749818302\">My sister (whose name is also Betty) is in her 30&#39;s and still, to this day,<br/>\nwill not watch ANY movie that has animals in it, or that features animals. I<br/>\nguess she has really self-regulated her movie viewing since she probably saw<br/>\na few animals movies when she was younger and felt extreme sadness at a part<br/>\nwhere the animal gets hurt, abused, lost, in trouble, etc... It doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmatter that the animals usually get saved in the end or whatever. She just<br/>\nwon&#39;t see any of them. She even recently refused to watch the movie &quot;Cats<br/>\nand Dogs&quot; because of this aversion. She doesn&#39;t mind watching any other gory<br/>\nor violent movie, in fact she likes those kind.<br/>\nAnother thing she won&#39;t watch are any movies or shows revolving around WWII<br/>\nor Hitler or concentration camps. She also saw a special on TV about that<br/>\nwhen she was a little girl and was horrified.<br/>\nSo, I think Betty won&#39;t be ready for the emotional part of animal movies or<br/>\nWWII movies at ANY age.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I remember when Josh was smaller, five maybe six, I got the movie Lassie<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Come Home, the old classic, at the library and we watched it until it got to<br/>\nthe sad part and he refused to watch anymore. He jumped up, turned it off<br/>\nand said, &quot;I don&#39;t like that!&quot; He then would not watch any *dog* movies<br/>\n&#39;cause he figured they were sad.  We tried to watch a Benji movie and he<br/>\nasked, &quot;Is it like the Lassie movie?&quot; He found that it too had some sad<br/>\nparts and he  said, &quot;I don&#39;t like that kind of movies.&quot;  He&#39;s overcome that<br/>\nsomewhat now, but still is touched by the sadness in any movie,(which I<br/>\nthink is good), to tears sometimes, and looks around to see if anybody<br/>\nnotices. &lt;g&gt;  But he still won&#39;t watch a Lassie or Benji movie. I guess he<br/>\nreally wasn&#39;t ready for the emotional part at that early age.  We just NEVER<br/>\nknow!!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Betty<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37290,"nextTopicId":37299}}
