Thanks<br/>\n&gt;  Dianna<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re still gonna get a lot of that!  (contradictions, I mean)<br/>\n<br/>\nEssentially (IMO) homeschool is any activity that is education at home rather <br/>\nthan a traditional school.  Well, that isn&#39;t good either.  How about <br/>\neducation directed by the parents/guardians/family and based from home...?  <br/>\nUnschooled is less structure.  For some it means no structure and strictly <br/>\nchild-led.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI avoid grade labeling.  At first it was difficult for ds to know how to <br/>\nanswer when someone asked what grade he was in; he felt like he somehow <br/>\ndidn&#39;t belong because he didn&#39;t have a label like everyone else he knew.  So, <br/>\nI took opportunities to point out to him when he had just learned something <br/>\nand say something like &#39;Look!  You just counted the correct change to the <br/>\nclerk.  That counts as our math lesson for the day.&#39;  A few examples and he <br/>\nstarted feeling more confident that he was getting enough &#39;school&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow when someone asks what grade he&#39;s in, he simply responds that we <br/>\nhomeschool and don&#39;t use grade categories!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe will be 12 in October.  He has never been to ps.  We have at times tried a <br/>\nmore structured approach, but always fall off the wagon.  I finally gave <br/>\nmyself permission to decide that our homeschool style was unstructured and <br/>\nwe&#39;ve done great every since!  At first I got real nervous about the &#39;what if <br/>\nwe miss something&#39; dilemma.  But, as time has gone on I see how silly I was <br/>\nto be concerned.  There is no way to STOP ds from learning!  He explores <br/>\nthings on his own.  When I insist on a time table or set curriculum, I get in <br/>\nhis way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI still use a text for math, but not for any other subjects.  That may change <br/>\nin the future, depending on the needs as we go.  Even the math text is used <br/>\nvery loosely.  We don&#39;t follow the schedule and will do a lot of on again, <br/>\noff again work.  It often depends on the weather!  If it&#39;s dreary outside (or <br/>\ntoo hot!) we&#39;ll do more inside things which may include the math text.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for assessments...I rely on conversations with my child.  I can clearly <br/>\ntell he understands use of the English language, for instance (or at least <br/>\nour Americanized version!).  He often comes to me with a theory he has come <br/>\nup with about xyz which will lead to exploration to discover if he is <br/>\ncorrect.  It truly amazes me what I can learn about my child by just talking <br/>\nand sharing with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe read a lot aloud and silently.  I have him read to me as well as my <br/>\nreading to him.  Family reading time leads to great discussions and lets me <br/>\nknow how well he is understanding what he reads and the world around him.  <br/>\nThe questions he asks as we are reading are great clues.  For instance, the <br/>\nreading might have the word &#39;racism&#39; in it; he has difficulty pronouncing the <br/>\nword, so we sound it out; then he asks what it means and it leads to a <br/>\ndiscussion.  Now, the next time we run into that topic, we&#39;ll have a <br/>\ndifferent discussion and I can tell he&#39;s learned from one time to another.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for nouns, verbs, etc.  As far as I&#39;m concerned an 8 yr old has no need to <br/>\nworry about such things.  If he can instinctively put together decent <br/>\nsentence structure, who cares whether he knows how many nouns, verbs, <br/>\nadverbs, adjectives, etc., were used in the sentence.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest real life use I&#39;ve ever had for such information was a fill-in-the blank <br/>\nstory game asking me to list nouns, verbs, etc., which were then put into a <br/>\nstory line.  Very humorous and lots of fun, but hardly an essential life <br/>\nskill.<br/>\n<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Helen Hegener","from":"Helen Hegener &lt;HEM-Editor@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"qJc9s8AstZ59B46fSmQAPzKQstZmtwloHSJ9_xCDx4irKUZ2-nAKMKPIaZzNOcJ2UAPAY9i0T1AX_bcEfdNyLjXolnAHya1pDkeEYuy08v9XBMxtQS4","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] new to group","postDate":"965120232","msgId":11677,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PHYwNDIyMDgwMmI1YWM0MDhkYmIzYkBbMjA4LjI2LjIzNS44MV0+","inReplyToHeader":"PDM5ODY1N0Y5LjY1REY2NUQ3QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDAwNDAwMWJmZmI3MiQ2YjMyZDQ0MCRiYjlkOTBhY0BlZHVjYXRlPiA8Mzk4NjU3RjkuNjVERjY1RDdAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":11676,"nextInTopic":11939,"prevInTime":11676,"nextInTime":11678,"topicId":11663,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
