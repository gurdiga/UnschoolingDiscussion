She was in a pretty good mood so it was a good time to discuss it.  I asked her if she was taking anything for depression and she said that she wasn&#39;t, and when she was it was for hot flashes, not for depression.  And I told her I was asking because I recognize a few of my own symptoms in her and wondered if maybe she was having trouble with depression.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said that she thinks she was teetering on it for awhile as there is a lot going on in her life right now (call it situational depression I guess) and she has since had a good cry and feels much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad for that, but I also know that her way of being can be chronic.  So I guess I&#39;ll just watch things and see if they become a chronic unpredictable thing again, or if it really does resolve as the stressful situation in her life resolves.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way I plan to protect myself by limiting contact to her only when she is behaving nicely.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110331,"nextTopicId":110308}}
