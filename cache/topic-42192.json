(Here&#39;s the <br/>\nshameless self-promotion part ;-)) I&#39;m not sure what the phrase &quot;reinforce <br/>\ndysfunction&quot; means, but I did write an article about my former attitudes <br/>\ntowards school, the damage done to my son, and the healing that unschooling <br/>\nhas brought. It&#39;ll be in the Nov/Dec issue of HEM. &lt;&lt;shamless plug, <br/>\nshameless plug, shameless plug&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet, I still don&#39;t want to get into a *school sucks* discussion here. I <br/>\nlike to focus on the joy.
