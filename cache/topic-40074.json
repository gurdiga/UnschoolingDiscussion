When <br/>\nthe days became so short and nights long, pagans had celebrations of light. <br/>\n(I am being very general here) The Catholic Church converted those <br/>\ncelebrations into their own to force pagans to *join.* The lights, Yule log, <br/>\nand the use of evergreen trees all have pagan roots and were adopted by the <br/>\nchurch as a way to ease this transition.<br/>\nChrist died at the Passover time. Passover is predetermined and therefore so <br/>\nis Easter. Easter is the first Sunday after the first full moon after the <br/>\nspring equinox. Lent is the time before Easter so that is how Lent is <br/>\ndetermined as well. It isn&#39;t because of convince. There are Easter traditions <br/>\nthat have pagan roots that the church adopted to *convence* pagans that <br/>\nEaster was what they should be celebrating. <br/>\nHalloween, another pagan celebration was converted to a Christian holiday <br/>\nbecause the church didn&#39;t like the idea of celebrating the dead. The day <br/>\n(November 1) is called All Souls Day or All Saints Day. Halloween is All <br/>\nHallows Eve, being the day before All Saints Day. <br/>\nThe church didn&#39;t necessarily invent these holidays as a way to &quot;pull the <br/>\npagans in&quot; but the church certainly did adopt pagan rituals, and use somewhat <br/>\nunsavory tactics to &quot;convince&quot; the pagans that the ways of the church were <br/>\nthe true and right way. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":119372139,"authorName":"audrey elwood","from":"&quot;audrey elwood&quot; &lt;audreyelwood@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Travelling & Christian Holidays","postDate":"1028739087","msgId":40105,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxNk1Dbnk3QWM5bTc1Qm1zbG8wMDAwNGM5YUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":40102,"nextInTopic":40109,"prevInTime":40104,"nextInTime":40106,"topicId":40074,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"you may be interested in a book caslled constantine s sword -if you haven t yet heard of it -i forget the author- sorry. audrey ...

Celebrations like Beltane were considered so horrific that the Church wanted  to make it clear that anyone participating was NOT Christian.  Some early converts tried to meld the old with the new (one example in modern times is people who have a shrine to Mary, say, but put voodoo artifacts upon it), and this was considered repugnant by the Authorities, so many things were done to ensure new members did not consider conversion an &quot;either/or&quot; process, including replacing some celebrations altogether, or at least forbidding participating in Pagan rituals.  That was one motivation.  In other cases,  actions were taken to try to stamp out Paganism (like building a Christian church on a site that was previously sacred to Paganism).  So I think you are both right -- it depends on the actual event.  You have to take it on a case by case basis.

There will be some down time and <br/>\nyou will have to spend that time somewhere. You will probably keep a PO Box <br/>\nin your home-state. That is the state I would concentrate on *knowing* the <br/>\nhsing law in. If you aren&#39;t planning on spending more than 3 months (some <br/>\nstates) to 6 months (most states) in any one state, then I wouldn&#39;t worry <br/>\nabout learning all the laws! What an exhausting way to spend your time <br/>\nanyway! (Unless you have a particular passion with the ins and out&#39;s of hsing <br/>\nlaw?) Besides, I just don&#39;t see the local truant officers spending time at <br/>\ncampgrounds, national parks and scenic byways. I would hope they think people <br/>\nat those places are on vacation. Should you run into an errant truant officer <br/>\nin some backwater area, I would just say, &quot;We are on vacation, but I saw a <br/>\ncouple of kids floating down the river on a raft a few minutes ago.

However, we don&#39;t plan to be without income.  My parents used to full time RV - they went on the road for about 3 years before going back to part time travelling.  From them, I&#39;ve learned a HUGE amount about earning income on the road.  Campground hosting is a great job for RVers - free spot and small salary.  They recommended to me a magazine called Highways.  It&#39;s targeted at fulltimers.  There&#39;s also a comprehensive campground guide for the nation and a publication that lists all hosting opportunities nationwide.  I was wondering, though, if you&#39;re a little concerned about the variety of homeschooling laws in the states you&#39;ll be passing through?  I guess to avoid problems, we&#39;ll have to research each state&#39;s statutes prior to spending a lot of time there in the school year.
