At 2 different times our children have expressed a desire to experience &quot;school&quot;. So they did. Lasted about a month each time. Then they had enough.  I see that as part of our journey.  I would imagine each of our Unschooling styles are as different as each of us. That would include each families journey.<br/>\nAs far as lableing my child. Well, I only say he is diagnosed as having Aspergers b/c perhaps there are other children Unschooled who are also diagnosed on the Autism Spectrum. They each have different learning capabilities and ways of exploring this world. We can always learn from one another. My way of seeing things is that there is no real &quot;expert&quot; just different levels of experience. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI respect all others parenting philosophies and hope mine wll be respected  as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nI should also mention that at different times my children have had music lessons. dance, played an organized sport etc.  All good experiences and all desired by the individual child. 2 still take piano from a very genteel older lady and my twins are fascinated by classic guitar and have a great teacher.  I do not see Unschooling as NEVER taking a formal class. I know just for me if I wanted to learn to knit I would likely take a basic class in it.
