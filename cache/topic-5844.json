When the children are in their teens, encourage them to enroll in<br/>\ncommunity college courses.

Encourage your children to<br/>\nlearn a trade.  Then later while they are working in the trade, see if they<br/>\ncan&#39;t take classes at the university (if that is what they want).  Sometimes<br/>\nemployers will pay the tuition for them.  Wow, what a deal!

If the children are so inclined, they might work towards ownership of<br/>\nthe family business, or starting their own business.<br/>\nThere are many splendidly self-educated people out there who are<br/>\nself-employed.
