Lots of great info<br/>\nabout how, even though Japanese test scores in science and math have always<br/>\nbeen so high, many graduates have a hard time later in the workplace because<br/>\nthey haven&#39;t learned to think for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article is here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/12/edlife/12MIKIT.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/12/edlife/12MIKIT.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHere is an excerpt:<br/>\n<br/>\nFree to Be<br/>\nBy MIKI TANIKAWA<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a typical exercise to promote orderly response. The teacher called on<br/>\neach student, who was to shout out his name. &#39;&#39;Here! Yuuki Tamori, I am<br/>\nfine.&#39;&#39; But Yuuki, 10, was shy.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;Why can&#39;t you do it when everybody else is doing it?&#39;&#39; the teacher<br/>\nadmonished him. He was made to stand beside his desk for the rest of the<br/>\nclass. Yuuki failed to respond to his name on several more occasions.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;The more the teacher pressed him, the more difficult it was for him to do<br/>\nit,&#39;&#39; said his mother, Haruko Tamori. &#39;&#39;I felt a sense of crisis after a<br/>\nwhile because Yuuki was losing self-confidence.&#39;&#39; Mrs. Tamori decided to<br/>\nsend her son to the Learnnet Global School in Kobe, one of a growing number<br/>\nof &#39;&#39;free schools&#39;&#39; that have emerged in reaction to the rigid curriculum,<br/>\ngroup-oriented instruction and large class size (typically 40 students) of<br/>\nthe Japanese school system.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike alternative schools in other countries, free schools in Japan range<br/>\nbroadly in quality and mission, from helping children who have difficulty<br/>\nadjusting to regular schools to offering nontraditional approaches to<br/>\neducation. But unlike in other countries, they are by definition<br/>\nunaccredited in Japan. While not enforced, the law requires that children up<br/>\nto age 15 attend schools that comply with government stipulations on<br/>\ncurriculum, facilities and number and qualifications of instructors.<br/>\nStrictly speaking, free school attendance is illegal.<br/>\n<br/>\nNonetheless, 300 to 500 such schools have opened over the last 10 years,<br/>\nfueled by a phenomenon known as toko kyohi, or refusal to go to school.<br/>\nNearly 140,000 children refuse to attend -- one in every classroom in Japan<br/>\nand more than double the number a decade ago, according to the Ministry of<br/>\nEducation, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. While poor grades and<br/>\nboredom often lead to chronic truancy, the reason most often cited is<br/>\nbullying, a problem so severe that it has drawn international attention. The<br/>\ngovernment is considering accrediting a school in Tokyo designed for toko<br/>\nkyohi children, and it has deployed counselors to schools around the<br/>\ncountry. But nothing has stemmed truancy, which is a particular problem in<br/>\njunior high.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54860,"nextTopicId":54976}}
