(And The<br/>\nSkylark Sings With Me).<br/>\n<br/>\nAm currently reading The Teenage Liberation Handbook and loving it!  My<br/>\nkids are 6 & 4, but this book is so reassuring about UNschooling and<br/>\nLIVING and trusting your kids.  I&#39;m so grateful to those who&#39;ve paved the<br/>\nway of HS before me.  Because of them, I got to learn about HS before my<br/>\nkids were school age.  I&#39;m glad that my kids are living life now, rather<br/>\nthan putting in their twelve years (or more) first.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love that bedtime doesn&#39;t have to be forced.  The other night (about<br/>\n9pm), Dd handed me a piece of paper that she&#39;d marked 4 grids on.  I was<br/>\n&quot;assigned&quot; to draw a picture of my 4 favorite things from that day and<br/>\nwrite a paragraph about each one.  (She&#39;d left a tiny space for each of<br/>\nmy paragraphs!)  LOL!  I told her I couldn&#39;t get to it right then, but<br/>\nwould later.  She reappeared about 30 minutes later and had done the<br/>\nassignment for me!<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t done &quot;school&quot; except for a few months (sort of) at the<br/>\nbeginning of kindergarten last year, so I&#39;m not sure where this all came<br/>\nfrom.<br/>\n<br/>\nGotta go fix &quot;lunch&quot; now for 4 yr old (it&#39;s 9am here).<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;You&#39;re welcome!
