I&#39;ll be posting this to a few groups, so please forgive<br/>\nany crossposts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m Sandy Horner, 45 and am fairly new to the homeschool adventure.  My<br/>\ndaughter, Alexa, 8, would be going to 3rd grade, had I not decided to pull<br/>\nher out of school last spring.  I&#39;m currently working part-time as a massage<br/>\ntherapist (2 days a week in my office), and am going to try to bring my<br/>\nbusiness home to our hobby farm in the country (horses, maple syrup<br/>\noperation, orchard....we keep pretty busy ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlexa and I belong to a co-op of homeschoolers that is rather small at the<br/>\nmoment (5 families with a few more interested), and would like to grow a<br/>\nbit.....the more the merrier, so they say! Some of us are unschoolers,<br/>\nothers more structured, but we welcome all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout us (from our flyer):  The Menomonie Area Homeschoolers is a group of<br/>\nactive homeschooling families who cooperate to create an enriching<br/>\nenvironment for homeschooled children ages 4-18 and their families.<br/>\nFamilies with younger siblings can be involved too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lively and eclectic group is organized as a cooperative - there is no<br/>\ndirector or teaching staff.  Each family helps develop ideas for classes,<br/>\norganize sessions, teaches mini-classes, and maintains the building.  We&#39;d<br/>\nlove to have you join us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe meet on Thursdays from 10am to 2 pm at the Family Learning Center, 1703<br/>\nWilson Street in North Menomonie (about 2 minutes from the Menomonie exit<br/>\noff I-94).  We welcome new and experienced homeschool families.  Come in and<br/>\nobserve for a day, or call for more information.<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca Kilde: 715-265-7421 or Luisa Gerasimo: 715-235-5289 (or<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bsf2@...\">bsf2@...</a>).<br/>\n<br/>\nOur building is also available for rent, so if you need a spot for your own<br/>\nhomeschool group that has outgrown its space, or any group that needs a<br/>\nkid-friendly space, we&#39;re happy to rent ours!<br/>\n<br/>\nSmiles,<br/>\nSandy & Alexa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81790,"nextTopicId":82002}}
