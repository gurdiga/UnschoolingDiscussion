The emphasis here is on disease. More than 600 pages are devoted to<br/>\n&gt; more than 700 different diseases and disorders. Each article discusses the<br/>\n&gt; causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis of the<br/>\n&gt; condition. Two thousand full-color illustrations let you see disease symptoms<br/>\n&gt; up close, understand the anatomy, and view treatments. Online resources are<br/>\n&gt; also given for additional and updated information--though the light-blue type<br/>\n&gt; of the URLs can make them difficult to read and type.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Besides disease information, you&#39;ll appreciate the 70 symptom charts--find<br/>\n&gt; your symptom (lump, wheezing, impaired vision, abdominal pain, for example)<br/>\n&gt; and follow the flow chart, which pins down specifics and makes suggestions.<br/>\n&gt; You can also learn first aid and read about drugs, surgery, and<br/>\n&gt; rehabilitation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also included is a CD-ROM that lets you explore various body systems and read<br/>\n&gt; interesting topics about how the body works, many with cool animations.<br/>\n&gt; (QuickTime Movie Player is included for you if you don&#39;t have it.) You can<br/>\n&gt; also connect to DK&#39;s Body Online Web site, an online health magazine. But one<br/>\n&gt; drawback to this otherwise wonderful resource is that it isn&#39;t obvious what<br/>\n&gt; features the CD-ROM has or how to navigate through it until you click the<br/>\n&gt; question mark at the upper right, which presents a guide to and explanation of<br/>\n&gt; the contents.
