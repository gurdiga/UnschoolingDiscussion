She is doing very well. I see her gathering experiences just like an unschooler would. She may or may not go back next year. She said she may be a skipping stone. Going to school some years, staying home others.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids fighting did not change, however, other than it was saved for afternoons and evenings. Just as intense. My reaction just as lousy much of the time. We talk alot about treating everyone respectfully, with examples. I spend a lot of time sharing moments I see them getting along.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest complains a ton when having to go to sibling activities. I  often find safe places for her so we can go with out her mood. I also add an activity she will like or bring along a friend for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre days are more sunny lately. I&#39;m not sure why. Most likely I&#39;m getting my own needs met and am more available to them. More present in the moment. I also stopped doing other stuff when I hear the beginning of blow-ups. I stop, wait near by, suggest alternatives if they are open. I am there, though. So they can talk through what is going on and get past the block and back into enjoying eachother.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary H.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Kid conflicts","postDate":"1049339315","msgId":62763,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU0LjM2ZmRhMWM1LjJiYmNmZmIzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":62754,"nextInTopic":62905,"prevInTime":62762,"nextInTime":62764,"topicId":62751,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/2/03 5:21:41 PM, maryfhickman@jps.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1573718410\">In a message dated 4/2/03 5:21:41 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maryfhickman@...\">maryfhickman@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Sandra has helped my family alot.

It goed deep into our own parental burnout. We were fortunate to have an 8 week workshop diving into these books. The most important thing I got out of it was.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Know my needs. Order, peace, respect...<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Speak my needs. I need help getting dinner on the table. I get frustrated putting dinner on the table alone. I want company while preparing dinner. The kids have gotten it. My need.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. We are works in progress<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Being kind feels good.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. We all are in roles.
