I just don&#39;t feel that <br/>\n he could possibly be any of these things (hyperactive, add, whatever) <br/>\n because he has a very long attention span for something he is interested in, <br/>\n very very long. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, first of all I would listen very carefully to my inner voice and my <br/>\nknowledge of that child, NOT what other people think I should do.<br/>\nBut you probably already feel that in your heart and are just needing <br/>\nreassurance.<br/>\nWhat you said about the ADD label is innacurate...he probably would be <br/>\ndiagnosed with it. Because I&#39;ve seen &quot;severe ADD&quot; kids focus intently on <br/>\nthings they are interested in for hours. Interest will focus a person.<br/>\nADD is not a disability unless you&#39;re in school and a teacher needs you to <br/>\nconform.<br/>\nOutside of school it is a useless label. By following your child&#39;s lead, by <br/>\ntrusting them to develop, you are doing exactly what he needs.<br/>\nWhat would a diagnoses do in this case? Would it change what you were doing? <br/>\nWould it help you understand him better and suit situations to him better?<br/>\nIf not, then what is the purpose of a diagnoses.<br/>\nThere are reasons to get diagnoses of certain problems. I would hate to see <br/>\ndepression go undiagnosed in certain individuals. Or Autism..<br/>\nBut ADD only exists in schools.<br/>\nOutside of school I think one could consider it a different learning style <br/>\n(isn&#39;t it interesting how unique we all are?).<br/>\nAnd as to the social skills that may be lacking....<br/>\nI have a dd with none of the other symptoms you mentioned that will not <br/>\nacknowledge or look at people most of the time. She does not like talking to <br/>\nstrangers....never has.<br/>\nBut she&#39;s a chatter box once she&#39;s comfortable with a person, which can take <br/>\na while.<br/>\nIf she hasn&#39;t seen a relative for a while they get the same cold treatment.<br/>\nI have no doubt that this is a stage, that I will have a very socially <br/>\nskilled young lady one day.<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m wrong, but I truly believe that as I&#39;ve seen an extremely shy son <br/>\nopen up in amazing ways in the last year or two.<br/>\nI say trust him...if he&#39;s happy, your immediate family is happy, that&#39;s <br/>\nimportant.<br/>\nThe outside relatives want the diagnoses it sounds like. I personally would <br/>\ngive it time and maybe in a couple years some of their fears will be allayed <br/>\nsomewhat.<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35251,"nextTopicId":32863}}
