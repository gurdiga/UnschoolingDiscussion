If he had a major booger<br/>\nhanging out his nose I&#39;d give him a tissue.   Unschooling is natural<br/>\nlearning and it seems very natural for a mom to help her kid in these<br/>\nsituations.   I&#39;d do the same thing for my husband or a stranger and I<br/>\nsure hope someone would do it for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise if I was making a social mess of things, if I was stepping in<br/>\nsocial poo or if I had the booger of anti social behavior hanging out my<br/>\nnose I&#39;d hope someone would point it out so I could clean up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the difference between a real booger and a social booger?   (One<br/>\ntastes better! HA!)  But seriously, what is the difference?

Today if I see him carrying a<br/>\nbig load of laundry I take part of the load, or open the door or whatever<br/>\nI can do to help.   I don&#39;t see offering help as a demonstration of lack<br/>\nof trust.   I don&#39;t help because I don&#39;t trust him to get the laundry to<br/>\nthe washer, I help because it&#39;s the right thing to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf my child offers his opinion or advice I don&#39;t think it&#39;s because he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t trust me.
