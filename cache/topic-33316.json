Going through too much physical turmoil to get embroiled on the stuff on the list too. ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-189693454\">Hi all,  Jacli here :)<br/>\nI&#39;ve been relatively quiet for quite a while.  Going<br/>\nthrough too<br/>\nmuch physical turmoil to get embroiled on the stuff on the<br/>\nlist too.<br/>\nBut Helen&#39;s message struck me.  I didn&#39;t appreciate her<br/>\nmethod<br/>\nbut I understood her madness. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe plain fact is that we seem to have cycles on this list.<br/>\nThe good, the bad and oh yes, the ugly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have moments when we shine.  When we all come together<br/>\nto help one another question and answer our collective<br/>\napproaches<br/>\nto schooling, unschooling and parenting in general.  These<br/>\nare the<br/>\nmoments when we -each of us- contribute just a little<br/>\nsomething, a<br/>\nlittle bit of our own flavor and when taken in create a<br/>\nmasterpiece.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we have moments when we get a little thoughtless or<br/>\ninsensitive.<br/>\nPerhaps too sensitive is what I should say.  Moments when<br/>\nfor just<br/>\na New York minute we let the bad in and become JUDGEMENTAL.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s okay.  This list is full of moms, dads, teachers,<br/>\nleaders<br/>\nand since we&#39;re all human on this list, the occasional<br/>\nscrew-ups.<br/>\nBut we acknowledge, apologize and move on.  And thank<br/>\ngoodness<br/>\nfor the occasional screw up.  They remind us to think<br/>\nbefore we speak,<br/>\nto consider and reconsider the way we treat or mistreat<br/>\nothers, such <br/>\nconsideration is probably a big asset for a group of folks<br/>\nattempting to guide<br/>\ntheir young-ins and deschool themselves at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is when the Ugly sneaks it&#39;s ugly face in.<br/>\nAhh, the moments<br/>\nwhen we tear down instead of buildup.  Then we go back in<br/>\nand do it again.<br/>\nThe long, long debates on whether so and so said what they<br/>\nsaid they said and so <br/>\nforth.  Usually followed by people upset about all the<br/>\npeople saying what was or<br/>\nwas not said and then the comments about how people should<br/>\ngo and say things<br/>\nsomewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not new for us.  But it is shameful.  Because when<br/>\nwe are good, we are <br/>\nAWESOME!  When we shine it is because, as a group we<br/>\nencourage, support <br/>\nand unite.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not care for the way Helen responded to the UGLY.  But<br/>\nI do think it came <br/>\nfrom an emotional place of frustration and disappointment<br/>\nthat it had come back <br/>\nagain.  And let&#39;s face it, when folks start telling other<br/>\nfolks to get on other lists,<br/>\nUGLY has come back in a big way.<br/>\n<br/>\nShame on us.  Do you know what I do when the ugly comes?<br/>\nWhen the first<br/>\nwhiff of ugly has come I try to ignore it by becoming real<br/>\nfriendly with my delete<br/>\nbutton.  But at times like this, times when UGLY has come<br/>\nback all the way<br/>\nand brought friends, I leave.  That&#39;s right.  I&#39;ve been off<br/>\nthis list several times and I&#39;m<br/>\nabout to do it again.  And that&#39;s okay too.  Because the<br/>\ntrue feeling of this list is<br/>\nstrong enough to survive even the ugly and the<br/>\ndisappearance of one or two faces.<br/>\nUgly is like a fire and if we all just stop feeding the<br/>\nflames IT WILL GO AWAY.<br/>\n<br/>\nSooner or later The Good will come back and when it does I<br/>\nand the others who have<br/>\nalready quietly slipped away for a bit will come back.  I<br/>\njust hope in the meantime that<br/>\nwe haven&#39;t already permanently alienated some of the<br/>\nwonderful people on this list who <br/>\nmaybe don&#39;t understand our ups and downs.  The list will<br/>\nsurvive, but it could come back <br/>\nand bloom and thrive if only we would all work just a<br/>\nlittle harder to stop feeding the ugly <br/>\nand start working The Good.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, just my two cents, bye all, Jacli :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Message: 1<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Sat, 23 Mar 2002 11:58:57 -0800<br/>\n&gt;   From: Helen Hegener &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM-Editor@...\">HEM-Editor@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Checking in/checking out<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dear friends and listmembers,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s a major disappointment to see this list fall back<br/>\n </span></blockquote>into the same <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;kind of downward spiral we experienced a few weeks (or was<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;months?) ago.<br/>\n&gt;...
