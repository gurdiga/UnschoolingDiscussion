When Tessa was born you<br/>\ncould hear her breathing, almost a weezing, when you<br/>\nwalked into the room... until our chiro came to adjust<br/>\nher several hours after she was born. Then you had to<br/>\nput your ear to her mouth to her the breaths. Amazing!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also asked what did people do before chiro care?<br/>\nWell I imagined they suffered. Headaches, neck aches,<br/>\nvision problems, leg pains, hand pains..etc.<br/>\nEverything is connected off the spine, keep that in<br/>\nalinement things work better! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nalso, why the continual<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; adjustments?  what do we <br/>\n&gt; keep doing to ourselves in the course of our days<br/>\n&gt; where we&#39;d need to keep <br/>\n&gt; going and going to keep getting adjusted?  i guess<br/>\n&gt; the thought of being so <br/>\n&gt; dependent is unappealing, too.<br/>\n&gt; erin<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Continual adjustments are important for my family to<br/>\nmaintain good health but also to fix things. When<br/>\nTessa was 3 she feel backwards off a swing and by the<br/>\ntime I got her in the house she had a fever! A quick<br/>\nrun to the chiro for an adjustment and the fever broke<br/>\nright in his office! He said when the body {in her<br/>\ncase neck} is out of alinement sometime a fever will<br/>\nbe produced as the body way of trying to fight off<br/>\nwhat is wrong. Dr. also said everyday falls for kids<br/>\nare the kind to be checked regularly so they don&#39;t<br/>\ndevelop into worse problems later on in life. For my<br/>\nfamily I try to take the girls every other month but<br/>\nright away if they catch a cold or have a fall. Sorry<br/>\nso long but a subject near to my heart! <br/>\nblessings <br/>\nJill<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend online invitations with Yahoo!
