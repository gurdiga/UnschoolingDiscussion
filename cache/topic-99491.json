And then to have to remember and enforce this<br/>\nidea - phew! So food is a right - but not all foodstuffs. Fresh air is a<br/>\nright - but not unlimited free time to play outdoors - or during the school<br/>\nday. A child has a right to love, but it can be withdrawn if they behave in<br/>\ncertain negative ways. On and on, and it can get really painful. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as you suggest below, it creates the idea that the things the little<br/>\ngirl has a right to are somehow less fun, less enjoyable - more along the<br/>\nlines of duties - than the good stuff which are categorized as privileges.<br/>\nThat is an unfortunate strategy that will likely make her dislike her<br/>\nmetaphorical and actual vegetables just on principle. <br/>\n<br/>\nI try to reduce the areas where there could be conflicts in my household. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think I ever spend a single second considering the idea that something<br/>\nis a privilege for Jayn to enjoy. I do think that I am privileged to have<br/>\nthis little wonder as my child. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;She limits her child<br/>\nto 2 30 minute shows that she must choose at the start of the day.  She<br/>\nfrequently loses this priviledge for totally unrelated things.<br/>\n.............My friend says the she wants her child to be well rounded and<br/>\nthat sitting<br/>\nin front of the tv for hours on end will not do that.  The thing is I have<br/>\ntwo friends, well actually everyone I know limits tv to a certain extent.<br/>\nAnd their kids are totally glued to it when it is on.  They are zombies.<br/>\n.............To me, calling<br/>\ntv a priviledge elevates it to something wonderful, yet forbidden.  Tv is<br/>\njust tv, another thing to do among many. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSame old horsehockey - she sees only two options - well rounded kids or tv<br/>\nviewers. I agree with the Zombie thing - I see it only in TV limited kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I asked her if she thinks my ds<br/>\nsits in front of the tv all day long.  She said well I hope not, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow what he is doing while you are starting a business and busy around the<br/>\nhouse so much----personal jab, foul!!!!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re not wrong - she is being backhandedly rude to you (if defense doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork, attack). It seems that you do have a voluntary obligation as a LLL<br/>\nleader to take her calls, and do all you can to help her. I still feel that<br/>\nshe is likely to choose to reduce her contact with you and others who may<br/>\nchallenge her assumptions.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;says CIO is not an option (sigh of relief).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a code word for formula? Or what does it stand for?<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The thing is that when she does see my ds, he tends to not react<br/>\npositively<br/>\naround her.  He is not what I would call the poster child for relaxed and<br/>\nrespectful parenting when he&#39;s around certain people.  I think he really<br/>\nsenses her negative vibe.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you meaning the dd4 or the mother in this when you say &quot;her&quot;? Sorry I&#39;m<br/>\nnot quite clear. If it is the little girl, it could be that he has a hard<br/>\ntime sharing you with someone who is that needy - a restricted, day-care<br/>\nbaby, living-with-criticism little girl could be much needier but has to<br/>\nexpress it in acting-out ways because she is getting negative feedback for<br/>\njust asking for stuff. That book I mentioned (It&#39;s not fair...etc) has a lot<br/>\nabout coping/allowing children to go safely through their process of<br/>\ntransitioning from school or day care back to the home environment.

I&#39;d like <br/>\nsome for letting kids watch as much as they choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite pro-television book is Teleliteracy by David Bianculli.<br/>\nIt has a chapter debunking the myths about children and tv.

Natural consequences can sometimes be just that, but &quot;logical&quot; <br/>\nconsequences are carried out by someone on purpose.<br/>\nFor example, take a toddler writing on the wall.  The natural <br/>\nconsequence is that now there&#39;s writing on the wall, which may or <br/>\nmay not be a big deal depending on which wall, how much clean walls <br/>\nare valued, and whether the marker is washable.  Mabye someone (the <br/>\nparent?) will decide to touch up the paint over the drawing and at <br/>\nthe same time help the child find a better place to draw.<br/>\nA supposedly &quot;logical&quot; consequence would be, for example, taking the <br/>\nchild&#39;s markers away.  Punishment, IMO.  <br/>\nAlfie Kohn illustrates the difference very well in his book Beyond <br/>\nDiscipline: From Compliance to Community.  He calls logical <br/>\nconsequences &quot;punishment lite&quot; and jokes about how adults can still <br/>\ncontrol their child externally but without having to feel like the <br/>\nbad guy, which is why the word &quot;consequence&quot; is preferred by people <br/>\nlike your friend. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope those two books help. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPatti</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154575365,"authorName":"Laura Johnson","from":"&quot;Laura Johnson&quot; &lt;lauraj2@...&gt;","profile":"imakebelieve2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] pro-television watching resources/unschooling journey","postDate":"1094908508","msgId":99515,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTkwMWM0OTgwMSQ1YzlhMWU5MCQ2ZjYzMDgwNEB5b3VybzBrd2t3OWp3Yz4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQwOTExMDgxMzEzLk1DWEQxNjY4Mi5tdGEwMDYudmVyaXpvbi5uZXRAbjZhLmJ1bGsuc2NkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":99514,"nextInTopic":99519,"prevInTime":99514,"nextInTime":99516,"topicId":99491,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... restricted and limited household - by all means make sure that you give your kid even more unoccupied time to get into what you might consider mischief.

I said it was just the way it was, her daughter has<br/>\nsome intense needs right now.  You can either meet her needs or not.  She<br/>\nsays CIO is not an option (sigh of relief).  I then suggested some coping<br/>\nskills for her lack of sleep and exhaustion.  The first being letting go of<br/>\nexpectations (there&#39;s that word again) and just approaching each day as it<br/>\ncomes.  A few days of her dd4 watching a little more tv than usual won&#39;t<br/>\nhurt.  The house not being cleaned, her daughter not having a playdate or<br/>\nactivity every day.  Short term solutions for a short term problem.  She is<br/>\nreally tired almost exhausted, yet runs around like crazy planning<br/>\nactivities and every waking minute of their lives.  And yes, I offered to<br/>\ntake dd with me for the day.  She really likes me and loves to come to my<br/>\nhouse, I&#39;m her &quot;girlfriend&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is that when she does see my ds, he tends to not react positively<br/>\naround her.  He is not what I would call the poster child for relaxed and<br/>\nrespectful parenting when he&#39;s around certain people.  I think he really<br/>\nsenses her negative vibe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis all came about when she was pregnant.  She said she really need to<br/>\n&quot;tightened the reins&quot; on dd4.

Her<br/>\ndd also has food issues (as the rest of the family) she is overweight and<br/>\nobsessed with food.  So, my df is very controling about that too.  So, now<br/>\nher dd sneaks food and hides it in her room and has started lying.  Then she<br/>\ncalls me and asks what to do.  Duh, again, so obvious.  I mentioned in a<br/>\nlater conversation, not focused on her dd, just that I had &quot;read an article<br/>\nor discussion&quot; that was saying something about when parents have many<br/>\ncontrols over their children, it can bring on sneaky or decietful behavior.<br/>\nI found this to be a good way to bring up things that she may not be ready<br/>\nto hear directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard.  We had a heated exchange and I didn&#39;t expect to hear from her<br/>\nfor a while.  I didn&#39;t realize until later than she got very personal with<br/>\nsome of her comments.  I tried to stay more general.  She also ended up<br/>\nsaying &quot;I was calling to get LLL advice.  I can&#39;t believe that you telling<br/>\nme to let dd watch more tv is what another league leader would say.&quot;  I said<br/>\nthat &quot;what I told you was to that often letting go of expectations about how<br/>\nthings should be can help you cope with the stress of the demands of an<br/>\ninfant during a high needs period.&quot;  The tv thing evolved out of the What do<br/>\nI do with my other child while I&#39;m resting all day? question.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, she did call to invite me along to evacuate to GA with her and her kids<br/>\nfor the storm.  Hhmmm, deadly hurricane or days on end of constant stress<br/>\nand negativity.  Tough choice.  I wish I had some more like minded people<br/>\nhere.  I&#39;m always looking out for them.

She has found numerous resources to back up<br/>\nthe limiting of television watching in children.  I&#39;d like some for letting<br/>\nkids watch as much as they choose.  We are also having issues over the<br/>\nno-punishment thing and could use some good resources for that as well.  I<br/>\nhad been reading Dr. Sears all along, but he is very anti-tv and even<br/>\nadvocates punishment as necessary so that children &quot;learn to respect<br/>\nexternal controls&quot;.  I was surprised, not about the tv thing, but advocating<br/>\npunishment.  I had never thought of us as punishers, but I guess some short<br/>\ntime outs would still be punishment, I see that now.  My friend actually<br/>\ntakes away tv for days at a time for minor rule infractions and her daughter<br/>\nis only 4.  This BTW, is the same friend with my money issue.  The<br/>\nfriendship may be fading fast.  But, she is a friend I have known a long<br/>\ntime.  She kept calling it consequences and did not like it when I said it<br/>\nwas a punishment.  &quot;No, we don&#39;t punish, we have consequences.&quot;<br/>\nI said it is the same thing.  She just didn&#39;t like the word.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dictionary is always a good source for word meanings, I reply drily.<br/>\nFrom Dictionary.com:<br/>\n<br/>\nConsequence:<br/>\n1.Something that logically or naturally follows from an action or condition.<br/>\nSee Synonyms at effect. <br/>\n2.The relation of a result to its cause. <br/>\n3.A logical conclusion or inference. <br/>\n4.Importance in rank or position: scientists of consequence. <br/>\n5.Significance; importance: an issue of consequence.

A penalty imposed for wrongdoing: “The severity of the punishment must...<br/>\nbe in keeping with the kind of obligation which has been violated” (Simone<br/>\nWeil). <br/>\n3.

They all still have school preparation and<br/>\nbehavior modification in the back of their paradigm. Almost none come from<br/>\nthe real point of view of Unschooling as living in freedom and respecting<br/>\nchildren. With the shining exception of &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot; by Valerie<br/>\nFitzenreiter. However that is a very challenging book for someone who is not<br/>\nactually looking towards Unschooling - it could be good to challenge someone<br/>\nhowever. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever the Gessell Institute books, I think the author of &quot;Your Four Year<br/>\nOld&quot; is Louise Ames, will give her a better idea of what a 4yo is likely<br/>\ndevelopmentally capable of, which does not include the impulse control to<br/>\nnecessarily follow arbitrary rules, or making connections between the<br/>\npunishment and the infraction. Since her child is so young she may get<br/>\nsomething from www.naturalchild.org .<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking away the TV entirely is possibly the most dopey punishment for a<br/>\nrestricted and limited household - by all means make sure that you give your<br/>\nkid even more unoccupied time to get into what you might consider mischief.<br/>\n(Not that I consider anything Jayn does as mischief.)<br/>\n<br/>\nA book, that is certainly not about Unschooling or even home schooling<br/>\n(plenty of school prep, pushing independence and not always respectful *in<br/>\ncomparison* to what Unschoolers suggest) but does strongly advocate against<br/>\npunishing is &quot;It&#39;s Not Fair, Jeremy Spencer&#39;s Parents Let Him Stay Up All<br/>\nNight&quot;. It is so far behind what we are doing now in my household, but I<br/>\nread it when I was pregnant and looking for some general kinder parenting<br/>\nguidance. At the time (what a neophyte I was!) I was astonished and SO<br/>\nrelieved to know that it was possible to parent without punishments or even<br/>\ntime-outs. It may help your friend, and it is for her journey that I suggest<br/>\nit - you are already beyond the ideas in it I expect. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t<br/>\nremember the author, but he is a PhD and father of several if that impresses<br/>\nher. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember that author&#39;s stance on TV etc. What is important to<br/>\nremember for yourself, if not in helping your friend, is that *all* the<br/>\nstudies are done on schooled children, whose personal time is limited by the<br/>\ndemands of school and its intrusion into the home (homework, rules,<br/>\nschedules, even language). Eventually a child&#39;s whole thinking revolves<br/>\naround school, and many of the conversations they have are to do with it. TV<br/>\nbecomes another competitor for the limited time they have to enhance their<br/>\nrelationships with their family, sleep, eat, play, or stare out the window<br/>\nmaking up a story. For these children TV is zone-out and wind down time, and<br/>\nin a way they need freedom to choose and watch even more than ours for whom<br/>\nit is just another learning tool/resource.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have never controlled Jayn&#39;s TV viewing in any way. Sometimes we have a<br/>\nhard time getting her to let us watch anything in the living room. Not<br/>\nbecause she wants the TV - Oh no - because she wants it OFF. She wants quiet<br/>\nand serenity. I can’t remember the last time I got to watch a tv show all<br/>\nthrough as it played (we have satellite & can record onto it) without her<br/>\nreally seeming to need it to be off. I hope I can watch old movies on TCM<br/>\nagain one day. Sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We have been really trying the letting go of controls, especially since<br/>\njoining this list.  We always have been very relaxed about most things, but<br/>\nI tended to think that I should be doing more to limit tv, encourage only<br/>\nhealthy foods, KWIM.  So far, it is going along well.  I am happier taking<br/>\naway my shoulds and oughts.  Some things we are still working on.  The food<br/>\nthing is hard with a child in the 5% growth chart who really would eat<br/>\ncookies all day (probably not, I know).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t have to be a sudden deluge. Just say &quot;yes&quot; more often. Save &quot;No&quot;<br/>\nfor life or limb threatening situations, and save &quot;later&quot; for when you are<br/>\nexhausted, on the way out, or need to think it over. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have no food restrictions, but we also have available plenty of the good<br/>\nstuff, like apples on the low shelf in the fridge. I don&#39;t wait for Jayn to<br/>\nask for something if she is busy playing, but bring her a plate of<br/>\nsandwiches or sliced strawberries if it seems like a while since she ate. We<br/>\nkeep sodas, juice, milk and bottled water. She drinks all of these things -<br/>\nbut plain milk and water by far the most. She turns down chocolate and<br/>\ncandies often, but also eats them fairly often. She also shares them with<br/>\nany visitor.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have an Ectopmorph, they will probably always be thin, graze a lot<br/>\nall day rather than eat a few substantial meals, and do well with small<br/>\nportions all their life (lucky them). How fortunate that you can honor that<br/>\neating style by having your child at home and free from eating to the bell.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Anyhow, this particular friend is very controlling over so many<br/>\naspects of her child&#39;s life, and since she asked my opinion, I am giving it.<br/>\nWe ended up in a bit of an argument.  I&#39;m not going to change her mind, we<br/>\nare at polar opposites on this, but I would like to be able to hold my end<br/>\nup in the discussion.  I am much happier and so is Ben now that we are yes<br/>\nparents all of the time, well, most of the time.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have sometimes told people that I didn&#39;t pull &quot;this stuff&quot; out of the air,<br/>\nbut that there are people with more than 20 years experience sharing that<br/>\nexperience online who are living this way, whose children have grown up and<br/>\nare marvelous, happy, intelligent and employed. Basically I say that it is a<br/>\nproven system, only for the purpose of reassuring people. Of course it is<br/>\nnot really &quot;a&quot; system or anything so rigid seeming, but it helps other<br/>\npeople feel less concerned that Jayn is on her way to misery and penury.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have lost friendships, just by letting them fade away. I don&#39;t have time<br/>\nfor negative judgmental people in my life. If people who know us can&#39;t see<br/>\nhow Jayn is thriving, happy and articulate beyond expectations for an almost<br/>\n5 yo, then they are just stooopid. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps your friend is defensive because your child is happy and thriving<br/>\nand yet you are relaxed, lenient and connected to your kid. How is that<br/>\npossible? Where is the worm in the apple? Could my whole way of life really<br/>\nbe unnecessary? she asks herself feeling uncomfortable. Oh we don&#39;t like<br/>\ndiscomfort. Truth - that is the worm in her apple eating away at her<br/>\nassumptions. So deny, deny as much as possible. Defend, and if that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork, attack. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the essential truth of what she has learnt from you and of your example<br/>\nin front of her will not go away; it will keep niggling at her mind. If she<br/>\ncan&#39;t handle that little bug, you may find that she initiates the separation<br/>\nby not calling as often etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope someone helps with the dad component. I&#39;m very lucky in my dh.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

She has found numerous resources to back up the limiting of television watching in children.  I&#39;d like some for letting kids watch as much as they choose.  We are also having issues over the no-punishment thing and could use some good resources for that as well.  I had been reading Dr. Sears all along, but he is very anti-tv and even advocates punishment as necessary so that children &quot;learn to respect external controls&quot;.  I was surprised, not about the tv thing, but advocating punishment.  I had never thought of us as punishers, but I guess some short time outs would still be punishment, I see that now.  My friend actually takes away tv for days at a time for minor rule infractions and her daughter is only 4.  This BTW, is the same friend with my money issue.  The friendship may be fading fast.  But, she is a friend I have known a long time.  She kept calling it consequences and did not like it when I said it was a punishment.  &quot;No, we don&#39;t punish, we have consequences.&quot;<br/>\nI said it is the same thing.  She just didn&#39;t like the word.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been really trying the letting go of controls, especially since joining this list.  We always have been very relaxed about most things, but I tended to think that I should be doing more to limit tv, encourage only healthy foods, KWIM.  So far, it is going along well.  I am happier taking away my shoulds and oughts.  Some things we are still working on.  The food thing is hard with a child in the 5% growth chart who really would eat cookies all day (probably not, I know).

I am much happier and so is Ben now that we are yes parents all of the time, well, most of the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing, I have noticed that dh seems to be tightening the controls as I am loosening.  Is this typical?  I do like getting to be the one who says yes more often now.  He has noticed that he is feeling the need to say no more and is not really sure why.  He is very aware of it and agreed when I mentioned it to him.  How have other families dealt with parents coming to this at a different pace?<br/>\nLaura J<br/>\nSorry this is kind of jumbled and choppy, my mind is on hurricane prep and I just sat down with this as a distraction.  I also wanted to thank you all for opening my eyes and my mind to a new way of parenting.  I may not get all the way there soon, but we are much happier.  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99521,"nextTopicId":99502}}
