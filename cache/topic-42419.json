Mary-the-pacifist, do you <br/>\nhave any thoiughts on this?  Anyone else?**<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a no guns rule for - hmm, had to stop and think, here - for something <br/>\nclose to 22 years of parenting. It held up until I finally had a kid who <br/>\npersisted and persisted and PERSISTED in being fascinated with guns in spite <br/>\nof prohibitions, rules, discussions, pleas, more discussions... He was the <br/>\nkid who could make a gun out out of anything, and did! Peanut butter and <br/>\njelly sandwich gun. K&#39;Nex gun (many different versions). Lego gun. Maple twig <br/>\ngun. Lilac blossoms gun! Mud pie gun. Origami gun. Plastic dinosaur gun. <br/>\nThere was gun play nearly every day despite my not allowing guns in the <br/>\nhouse. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe wanted a cap gun desparately. Finally, after YEARS of being worn down, <br/>\nwhen he again begged to be allowed to buy one with his own money I relented, <br/>\nsubject to a short list of rules. (Most important being No pointing the gun <br/>\nat anyone who hasn&#39;t explicitly agreed to be part of the game. Second being, <br/>\nno caps fired in the house.) <br/>\n<br/>\nThat was (I think?) two years ago. The first week the gun was outside every <br/>\nday. Twice a day. The second week he probably missed a day or two. Soon it <br/>\nwas every other day, then once a week. Now, I saw him take it out the other <br/>\nday for the first time in months. And he hasn&#39;t made a gun in ages, though he <br/>\nstill makes many other fascinating things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should have let him buy it the first time he asked, we&#39;d have been over the <br/>\ntrauma years earlier! (Maybe. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42412,"nextTopicId":42424}}
