Remind me what state you&#39;re in again -- I <br/>\nwish I could go.  Where will you hold it -- in someone&#39;s house?  Rent a <br/>\ncommunity hall?  What other prep are you doing?   Will there be snacks?  What <br/>\nare the liability issues?   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I&#39;m looking at a community center that is right on the bay. We meet at <br/>\ntheir park weekly, it&#39;s beautiful. The center has a nice, large basketball <br/>\ncourt and a side room that would be perfect for this type of thing.<br/>\nI am going to talk with the guy in charge of renting it to see if we can get <br/>\nit for free...I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;ll work with us. Very nice on the phone.<br/>\nAnyway, I haven&#39;t done any other prep yet as it&#39;s still in the planning <br/>\nstages. I will encourage everyone to bring a sack lunch and picnic in the <br/>\npark and play afterwards.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think the liability issues will be important since it&#39;s on city <br/>\nproperty and it&#39;s a voluntary thing. Just the same as when we meet up for <br/>\npark day probably.<br/>\nI&#39;ll let you know how it progresses. My initial dream, which almost became <br/>\nreality before I woke up and realized this was NOT the time in my life, was <br/>\nto open a business. It was heavy into the planning stages before I pulled <br/>\nout. We were going to have an art store in which people could come and have <br/>\nall sorts of materials available to them...canvas, paints, ceramics, wood <br/>\nprojects etc.....and dabble with different materials. There would be a gift <br/>\nshop and a coffee bar with mocha&#39;s, capuccino, Italian soda, cookies etc....<br/>\nAfter I realized it was too much with a baby, I thought I&#39;d approach an art <br/>\ngallery about opening a resource room to the public.<br/>\nMaybe only have it open three times a week and make loads of art materials <br/>\navailable, a kiln and what not.  There would have to be funding for it of <br/>\ncourse, don&#39;t know how that would go over.<br/>\nSomeday when my kids are all growed up I&#39;ll probably start something up!<br/>\nIn the meantime, the community center will fill the need.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42035,"nextTopicId":42038}}
