She is on my bipolar homeschooling <br/>\ne-list.  Bipolar kids often have particular cognitive problems that really <br/>\neffect their learning math.  Have any of you had any similar experiences <br/>\nand ideas that might help Dorothy?  We would both appreciate any <br/>\nsuggestions you might have.  I know she is just tearing her hair out!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much!!  Christina in Seattle<br/>\n*************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Kristin, I am very impressed about your 15yo learning multiplication <br/>\nand division. My 16yo still can&#39;t do either. We&#39;re doing a Survival Skills <br/>\nmath course, and it&#39;s just killing him. Simple things like keeping a check <br/>\nregister, or reading a bank statement, are incomprehensible. He just <br/>\nlearned a couple of years ago to know the months of the year in order, and <br/>\nnow he sees a banks statement with a date like 06-24-02 and he just freaks! <br/>\nI explained what it means, and if he counts them off on his fingers he can <br/>\ndo it, but it makes him furious because he feels like they&#39;re &quot;tricking&quot; him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course, aside from math, he&#39;s very bright, very verbal. I have him <br/>\nsigned up next month to take his PSATs, but who am I kidding? AS bright as <br/>\nhe is, this math thing is going to keep him from doing everything. How can <br/>\nhe go to college? How can he even do vo-tech stuff, if he cannot subtract <br/>\n38-12? How can he have any job if he can&#39;t remember what time it is, or <br/>\nwhat day it is, or what month comes next? Some days I just despair!<br/>\n<br/>\nDorothy&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81761,"nextTopicId":81633}}
