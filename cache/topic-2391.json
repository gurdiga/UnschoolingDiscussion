I was amazed the day that we did the erupting <br/>\nvolcano project and Sterling (3yo) had to build scenery around it for <br/>\nthe dinosaurs.  we set the volcano in a shallow box with flip up <br/>\ncover and drew trees and mountains on the inside of the cover.  added <br/>\nfish tank gravel and moss around the volcano and had to go outside <br/>\nand find just the right rocks to use as the boulders.  this turned <br/>\ninto quite an elaborate ordeal with one idea leading to another.  <br/>\nabout the time i thought we must be done, he said &quot;Hey! the dinosaurs <br/>\nneed water to drink! I know, let&#39;s add a lake!&quot;  oh my goodness.   <br/>\n<br/>\n He<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; slept in the castle for the first 2 or 3 nights it was built.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  this is so precious!  i hope you got pictures!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Peace,<br/>\n&gt; Liz<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Michele Moss<br/>\nMom of Sterling Tyler age 3 yrs old<br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Resource Web site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.icstech.net/~michele\">http://www.icstech.net/~michele</a><br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Discussion Group:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/list/psk\">http://www.egroups.com/list/psk</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jac & Liz Grimes","from":"Jac & Liz Grimes &lt;JGrimes@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"WSo7bC3mnhEH4kNMbKQSblmeMm51SIA_3KaKwFlfCLTCTGW3TFXYwVkEyw-tCEFEJdTtVTPCxDGgIG_c7wSdS4o9JDzscesCK4piGIM","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Cardboard Constructions","postDate":"935925112","msgId":2391,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xNzcuMjM5MS45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2420,"prevInTime":2390,"nextInTime":2392,"topicId":2391,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I currently have a cardboard castle sitting in our dining area.
