My daughter (11 1/2) is <br/>\nalready taking horseback riding lessons - has been for 2 years. She goes once <br/>\na week to a quiet peaceful equestrian center and has a private lesson with a <br/>\nsweet teacher and it is all very very relaxed and easy (she even often rides <br/>\na horse named, &quot;Easy&quot;) and she loves it. I&#39;m thinking it is enough <br/>\n&quot;horsiness&quot; for her - she&#39;s happy, it is convenient (it is expensive - but <br/>\nwe&#39;ve adjusted to the expense by now, so it isn&#39;t killing us anymore).<br/>\n<br/>\n4-H is much much more consciously intentionally &quot;educational&quot; - they meet <br/>\nweekly for 2 hours as a group - up to 8 kids all in the same level (of five <br/>\nlevels). They study horses - anatomy, health, feed, care, genetics, tack, <br/>\netc. -- everything to do with horses. As they learn, they have all those <br/>\ntypical 4-H opportunities to put together presentations for &quot;demo days&quot; and <br/>\ncounty fairs and so on. There is a large amount of recordkeeping. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt her level, they also get to go to the stables and take a horse out and <br/>\njust ride - during specific times - of which there are a lot. They are <br/>\nrequired to go to the stables at least one time per week in addition to their <br/>\nlesson, to practice and to help with care of the club&#39;s horses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of shows, too. Like one a month or more. My daughter has no <br/>\ninterest in competing, but the leader says that even those who don&#39;t compete <br/>\ncan come to the get-ready day - which is about 10 hours the day before a show <br/>\n- washing and shaving horses and packing up tack, etc., and they can go to <br/>\nthe show as handlers - helping groom, etc., and cheer on their teammates. So <br/>\n- shows are 3 days - really - of full involvement. And they cost usually <br/>\naround $50 to compete - including transportation and feed for horses, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - for the money (which is approximately the same as I pay right now for <br/>\nprivate weekly lessons) she gets much more horse-time and more <br/>\nhorse-education and opportunities for showing and competing and demonstrating <br/>\nand just handling horses. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe big glitch - she doesn&#39;t really want to give up her current lessons and <br/>\nthere is no WAY we can pay for both private lessons and the 4-H program.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - this is a difficult decision for her. Any thought-provoking insight or <br/>\nideas or comments or whatever -- would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s active in other things - she&#39;s in Girl Scouts, she&#39;s on a soccer team <br/>\nwhich she LOVES!!! She&#39;s on a Destination Imagination team - which she loves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could influence her one way or the other, at this point, because she&#39;s so <br/>\ntorn. My considerations include my own convenience - the extra driving and <br/>\nhanging around stables a lot (which doesn&#39;t interest me very much - although <br/>\nI have learned to enjoy the horses more - to appreciate them as the amazing <br/>\ncreatures that they are).<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45363,"nextTopicId":45336}}
