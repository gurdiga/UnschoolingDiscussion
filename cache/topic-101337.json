Joanne is an amazingly strong woman who has already <br/>\ndealt with so much with her young daughter Lucy over the past year, and <br/>\nnow this! You can read more about Joanne&#39;s story here: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Joanne.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Joanne.html</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis wonderful, giving woman has just been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin&#39;s <br/>\nLymphoma. All of this has happened so quickly! She went in for what she <br/>\nfeared might be strep throat, was flown to Washington Hospital Center <br/>\nand has now finished her first round of chemotherapy--all in just over a <br/>\nweek! This is a tremendous amount of emotional trauma and upheaval for <br/>\nthe family to process, and those of us trying to help are working <br/>\nquickly to identify the most practical and effective ways to expend our <br/>\nenergy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur goal is to provide the family with allergy-free meals at least twice <br/>\na week, and there is a small group of people willing and able to cook <br/>\nunder such rigorous conditions. Others are offering to do the grocery <br/>\nshopping to ensure that the family has a good stock of allergy-free <br/>\nfoods in the home as well. This is where we feel our energy will be most <br/>\nusefully spent during these difficult times.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring this Season of Giving, we are trying to raise as much money as we <br/>\ncan so that the folks doing the shopping can buy the groceries and leave <br/>\nthem for the family as a gift during these emotionally and financially <br/>\nstressful times. Any little bit that we can raise will go a long way <br/>\ntowards easing this family&#39;s burden.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know so many of you have crises on your own homefront, and I&#39;m hoping <br/>\nthat this appeal does not come across as inappropriate in these forums. <br/>\nI feel that I need to reach out to help this homeschooling family in any <br/>\nway I can because they are having to endure more than any family ought. <br/>\nPlease feel free to hit the delete key and move on; I am reaching out <br/>\nhere to make peace in my own heart.  Thank you all so much for reading!<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101125,"nextTopicId":101336}}
