Well I am a Christian but even so,I feel like  a square peg in our <br/>\nlocal group.  But how DO you find local unschoolers?  I am on a local list <br/>\nthat is suppsed to be for homeschoolers and unschoolers alike but it only <br/>\nseems to be homeschoolers. And why is unschooling so scary to some people <br/>\nanyway?  I know what you mean - they dont mess with me about unschooling but <br/>\nI see this funny look in their eye when I mention it.  I dont know if it is <br/>\nfear......or maybe they are just not familiar with it. That could be it.  <br/>\nWell, if they let me stay in long enough, maybe I can unlearn enough so that <br/>\nsome of them will want to unschool too!<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"RValvo7626@aol.com","from":"RValvo7626@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"3Pqedjg0bQNXTPU4svWxSdm_EW_9gXILDXnAUT9HxVZ8HDyUH4bqlMD8ppgN-MkgQa3QHJGVhQMr","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1472","postDate":"1000522090","msgId":25684,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJkLjExMDNkMGYxLjI4ZDQxYjZhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25694,"prevInTime":25683,"nextInTime":25685,"topicId":25684,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/14/01 5:19:02 PM Mountain Daylight Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1272253525\">In a message dated 9/14/01 5:19:02 PM Mountain Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Also, our local homeschool group is SO <br/>\n school-at-home oriented and when I go around them, I find myself tending to <br/>\n be really anxious and look for<br/>\n a curriculum.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have trouble fitting into our local HS group myself.
