I don&#39;t<br/>\nrecommend anyone self treating except when all options have<br/>\nbeen exhausted and no relief occurs.  After doing a great<br/>\ndeal of research, and knowing to consult a doctor who was<br/>\nexperienced with alternative herbal medicine, he found<br/>\nrelief from many of his symptoms and he is much happier. He<br/>\nwill always live with it but traditional medicine did not<br/>\nwork for him. He is now able to earn a living. I am all for<br/>\nself treating for minor illnesses.  I know of one family who<br/>\nare treating their son for ADHD with herbals and they love<br/>\nthe results without the ritalin induced state he was once<br/>\nin.<br/>\nDara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7514,"nextTopicId":7520}}
