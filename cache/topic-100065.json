I have to say that this conference was really altering to me <br/>\nand  _my family_ (mip://02344400/my%20family) . We have always felt  <br/>\nuncomfortable in our local homeschooling groups, and truthfully didn&#39;t quite  <br/>\nunderstand why. I must say that after a day at the conference we all just  started <br/>\nfeeling like we had found home. My daughter felt totally comfortable,  and <br/>\ncommented that everyone she met was different, and it was okay! They were  not <br/>\nnecessarily different like her, but different like themselves. So after  trying to <br/>\nfigure out what type of learners we are, we have learned that we are  much more <br/>\nin tune with unschoolers. Why has it taken us so long? I am learning  so much <br/>\nfrom this list, and I am questioning so much about myself as a parent.  And I <br/>\nagree with needing to be around people who inspire me.
