Nowadays <br/>\neven TV cartoons have that lighting and shading, but until Roger Rabbit, <br/>\ncomputer animation wasn&#39;t doing &quot;depth&quot; in that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe someone here has the link for some of the video-rental-by-mail places.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the best animations I&#39;ve ever seen is Teeny Little Super Guy.  There <br/>\nused to be some on Sesame Street, and it&#39;s other places too.  (Not owned or <br/>\ndone by CTW.)  If anyone knows of a making-of for those I&#39;d love to see it.  <br/>\nThere is stop-action animation  but also the characters are a series of <br/>\ndrawings on cups, mugs, glasses... and so as the piece is moved to create the <br/>\nmovement, the cup is changed to another pose of the character too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"brendaclaspell@aol.com","from":"brendaclaspell@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"gXVn6qLgVX2cl59w9csUy83ih0UkVUNn-4uOalOTU1RJiXGu314iw0Hw4j-IMqsion_ZoO6xScoL3JLRpw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Need some ideas...","postDate":"1000780213","msgId":25905,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwZS41M2U5YzhjLjI4ZDgwYmI1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25920,"prevInTime":25904,"nextInTime":25906,"topicId":25905,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 3yo son has recently taken a large interest in what the tv/movie characters are made of, i.e. clay, cartoon, puppets, computer image, etc. I ve been","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-145616304\">My 3yo son has recently taken a large interest in what the tv/movie <br/>\ncharacters are made of, i.e. clay, cartoon, puppets, computer image, etc. <br/>\nI&#39;ve been answering all questions best I can, but wanted to know if anyone <br/>\nknew of any resources for this kind of thing.
