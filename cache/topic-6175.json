My best friend is doing costuming for the local high school productions too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked my son if he was interested in working backstage at a community theater...even if it meant no pay.  He seemed really interested ( a first for things that don&#39;t offer a paycheck).  That says something to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the SCA sounds just so incredibly neat.  I have always loved that time period even though I don&#39;t really know that much about it. I used to look at picture books from the library that were all about the old Kings and Queens.<br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;m really looking forward to getting involved.  I did email one of the local officers.  Still waiting for a reply.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughters have no lack of interests either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my son, who was talking about going back to high school next year opted instead to &quot;dual enroll&quot; and try to get into one or two electives instead (tech theater and video production).  He realized that the actual core classes he&#39;d have to take as a full time enrolled student weren&#39;t really what he was interested in anyway.  And I hope it sunk in that he might not see his friends *anyway*, even at lunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt hasn&#39;t hurt either that his friends keep saying how lucky he is that he gets to homeschool and he doesnt&#39; have to take the PSSA test (statewide test).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when I asked him if he wanted to sit down and &quot;do algebra&quot; (key to style), he said &quot;Mom, I can *learn* this on my *own*&quot;.

Between preparing meals and snacks, cleaning up <br/>\nafter ourselves, shopping for supplies, finding some time to read and <br/>\nexercise, a little down time in front of the TV, some socializing <br/>\nwith family and friends, a few dentist and Doctor appointments now <br/>\nand then, hip hop lessons, hockey etc... we can&#39;t keep up! I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow where you&#39;d find the time to consider and manufacture curriculum <br/>\nnever mind the timely application of such. In fact, my friends who <br/>\nare teachers in public schools, find that the process of curriculum <br/>\ncreation, application and testing, takes up all of their energy and <br/>\ntime. The focus is always on what to show the parents at open house <br/>\nand report card time. The school board calls this accountability, I <br/>\ncall it a waste of precious time. Childhood and natural learning <br/>\ncomes to an abrupt halt, when one reaches the age of 7, with the <br/>\nimplementation of curriculum and the assault of continuous testing. <br/>\nFor us it&#39;s like summer/fall/winter/spring holidays all year round. <br/>\nEach activity we undertake leads seamlessly to the next. Because we <br/>\nhave eliminated testing from our curriculum of daily living we have <br/>\nno need to artificially impose review and so we can focus on <br/>\nresearch, discovery and adventure to direct our daily lives and fill <br/>\nthe time that exists between taking care of the basics like grooming, <br/>\npreparing meals, eating, cleaning up the mess etc......Even TV can&#39;t <br/>\ncompletely stop learning from happening. I worry all the time but I <br/>\nconsider this to be a good mothers natural condition. My 18 year old <br/>\nunschooler is taking culinary arts courses at a local college <br/>\n(reflects our core curriculum!!) and working at a local department <br/>\nstore. When he&#39;s adding up the hours of work and pay due he seems to <br/>\nhave adequate math skills. He&#39;s working the cash which is easy for <br/>\nhim being part of the computer generation. They love him in the <br/>\nelectronics dept., being familiar with a remote control from <br/>\nbabyhood, he can run and program any piece of electronic equipment. <br/>\nMy mother was in the store and heard them call over the <br/>\nintercom, &quot;Sky to electronics&quot; and she was so proud! Not exactly Dr. <br/>\nM to emergency but his future is unfolding as it will and many of her <br/>\nfears are shrinking away. She&#39;s finding it easier to be supportive of <br/>\nour somewhat unusual lifestyle these days which makes it way easier <br/>\nfor me with my 7 and 11 year olds.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you follow your own heart and instincts your children will learn <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to follow their own!

Between preparing meals and snacks, cleaning up after ourselves, shopping for supplies, finding some time to read and exercise, a little down time in front of the TV, some socializing with family and friends, a few dentist and Doctor appointments now and then, hip hop lessons, hockey etc... we can&#39;t keep up! I don&#39;t know where you&#39;d find the time to consider and manufacture curriculum never mind the timely application of such. In fact, my friends who are teachers in public schools, find that the process of curriculum creation, application and testing, takes up all of their energy and time. The focus is always on what to show the parents at open house and report card time. The school board calls this accountability, I call it a waste of precious time. Childhood and natural learning comes to an abrupt halt, when one reaches the age of 7, with the implementation of curriculum and the assault of continuous testing. For us it&#39;s like summer/fall/winter/spring holidays all year round. Each activity we undertake leads seamlessly to the next. Because we have eliminated testing from our curriculum of daily living we have no need to artificially impose review and so we can focus on research, discovery and adventure to direct our daily lives and fill the time that exists between taking care of the basics like grooming, preparing meals, eating, cleaning up the mess etc......Even TV can&#39;t completely stop learning from happening. I worry all the time but I consider this to be a good mothers natural condition. My 18 year old unschooler is taking culinary arts courses at a local college (reflects our core curriculum!!) and working at a local department store. When he&#39;s adding up the hours of work and pay due he seems to have adequate math skills. He&#39;s working the cash which is easy for him being part of the computer generation. They love him in the electronics dept., being familiar with a remote control from babyhood, he can run and program any piece of electronic equipment. My mother was in the store and heard them call over the intercom, &quot;Sky to electronics&quot; and she was so proud! Not exactly Dr. M to emergency but his future is unfolding as it will and many of her fears are shrinking away. She&#39;s finding it easier to be supportive of our somewhat unusual lifestyle these days which makes it way easier for me with my 7 and 11 year olds.<br/>\nIf you follow your own heart and instincts your children will learn to follow their own! Their more likely to find happiness in this pursuit than they are by doing what they&#39;re told all the time.

My daughter refuses to write, read, do math, anything related to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will be her second full year of homeschool, she is 10.  I  worried and fretted and worried some more, that I was neglecting her because everything I suggested she rejected so I just let her be.  She chose to listen to music, play outside, craft or draw.  Patience is such a hard thing for a mom to practice!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow this year I feel I have deschooledd also.  Had to get over that &#39;we need to do math today&#39; feeling.  So she still won&#39;t read, unless it is outloud to me--but she loves to listen to me read...progress.  She writes in secret.  At night before sleep she uses a flashlight and writes songs or poems.  She shares occasionally.  She is actually quite good. We have workbooks, my littler one has never been to school and she is 8, she loves workbooks, but they are optional.  Emily will work on those with her little sister too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Caren, deschooling has taken almost 2 years and I still see residual effects.  Some days it is me pulling out a book and reading while they lego or draw or write.  The days I think they are listening the least are the days they ask me pretty detailed questions!  Some days it is her saying she wants to know how a sonic boom works.  (we heard it here in Illinois).  Some days she just wants to have me read to her all day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I have my littler one asking for a math test, and could you make me a spelling list.  (Her public school friends are doing this).  So we make a list and she memorizes.  They both love to memorize poems or songs or prayers.  It is just so strange and wonderful to see their little minds working.  Emily is coming around, just takes time and patience and a mom that only wigs out occasionally!<br/>\n<br/>\nKnow that you are doing all the right things.  Keep introducing new things or not.  Sometimes I find something I want to learn about and just do it...they always join in, sometimes they stay, sometimes they don&#39;t. Another great jumping off spot for us is the newspaper.  We get our coffee or tea in the morning in our jammies in my bed and go through.  Again, sometimes there is something there, sometimes not.  I think they like the routine of it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTeri<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMake a difference, help support the relief efforts in the U.S.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clubs.lycos.com/live/events/september11.asp\">http://clubs.lycos.com/live/events/september11.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Teri Loftis","from":"&quot;Teri Loftis&quot; &lt;itsmeeteri@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"wnwar7F4s98c7b3z8CYNLHE938fFrW_iR4PHropKO9YPZz6pwIXLnfLxQQMbKpuaYe1Uo2cfnPJTYP_qKsFI2RLpEBLZEAdEoiig","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] deschooling","postDate":"1002716077","msgId":26847,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENDSVBLT05LRFBOUEZCQUFAbWFpbGNpdHkuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26835,"nextInTopic":26871,"prevInTime":26846,"nextInTime":26848,"topicId":6175,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-- On Tue, 9 Oct 2001 12:41:31 ...

I think it reminds me of the years I was depressed and never had &quot;it&quot; together.  Anyway, Max has been just kind of hanging around, looking like he&#39;d like me to tell him what to do.  He found an old book a grandparent had given him - fun with reading kind of thing where you fill in the blanks - and he was *thrilled* to be doing that.  Even though he thinks like this:  One of the fill-in-the-blanks was The _________ jump up high.  Boys or man?  He chose boys, not because of the plural &quot;jump&quot; but because he thought it was really silly for a grown man to be jumping.  If the word had been &quot;jumps&quot; he still would have chosen boys, because that&#39;s the way he thinks.  Then he would have looked in the back and he would have been &quot;wrong&quot;.  OK, so now that particular book is gone, but he really wants to be doing more &quot;school&quot;-like work, because that&#39;s what he&#39;s used to.  I have read where kids who have gone to school need time to &quot;deschool&quot;, and that I just need to be patient, let him hang out, and he&#39;ll find himself.  But I&#39;m worried that because of my disorganization, maybe I&#39;m not providing him with a good environment for doing that.  It feels neglectful.  I&#39;m NOT neglecting him, and if he came up and said &quot;I want to go look at __________&quot; I&#39;d take him in a minute, but he&#39;s not really interested in anything.  He does read a lot.  He&#39;s almost nine.  I really believe he needs time to &quot;heal&quot; from <br/>\nhis school experiences.  Nothing severely traumatic happened, but hearing that what you&#39;re interested in has no value, that finishing something on time has more value than achieving your vision of it, etc., certainly left some scars.  Has anyone else on the list been here?  I&#39;ve been trying to act to everyone around me that I believe that everything is fine, and deep down I believe it will be, but before that deep down is a lot of fear.

How many adults, fully functional and &quot;well rounded&quot; do you know who use these skills regularly that are not job related?  If you need a skill for work you will know that by the time you reach the college level if you are focused on a particular career, and can pick it up in college if you still need to.  Otherwise, you learn just like everyone else does, as you go, as the need presents itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t say that I can diagram a sentence right now (who wants to?) it&#39;s not something I consider fun.  However, I am a very language oriented person, and am more comfortable with the written and spoken word than most people I know.  I was a peer tutor and teachers aide (paid) in college for English professors.  I was not diagraming sentences, but rather helping people to understand what a complete sentence were, and what the parts of sentences were (as in subject, action, conclusion, etc) and what the necessary parts of paragraphs were, and how to know when to move on to the next paragraph.  I also taught when something was off topic, and how to define topics and express yourself, how to use a thesaurus and dictionary as tools to aid the writers craft, what the parts of a paper were (beginning, middle and end) and how to recognize what facts and information fit into which categories and how to smoothly transition them in.  You would be amazed how very, very many people get al!<br/>\nl the way through institutionalized school withouth the slightest idea how to do these things, and they are basic skills to writing anything from a letter, to business proposals, to creative writing and fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf other people have to learn these things later, on their own, and they made it all the way through school, I can easily see giving my children the opportunity to learn much more than these skills without even trying.  As to math...I don&#39;t know Trig., or Calculus, or much Algebra for that matter.  I know I do algebra, as I can figure out missing numbers in equations and do the math in my head required to figure prices in the grocery store with sales, and coupons, and price per ounce, as well as figure distances and times for travel, etc.  But I don&#39;t think I could sit down and write a formula.  Not my cup of tea.  But I don&#39;t know anyone who thinks me lacking or somehow deficient because of that.  In fact I don&#39;t know anyone who knows all those things you named and does them regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn life, you learn the skills you need and use.  If the need is a false or artificial one (such as needing to learn them for a test, or to please a nervous parent) you will probably forget them.  If the need is true, and the original learning in reinforced by repeated use in life, you will remember.  Likewise if you HATE a subject, you will learn less and remember less about it, than about one you love and enjoy.  That&#39;s how it always works, no matter how you obtain your knowledge and how you learn (unless of course you have an infallible memory, what a curse that would be!)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my .02<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"heatherhada@myTalk.com","from":"heatherhada@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"aZxG2lNbKixsC1jSI1luk0pcD8bkSsVvOvtXieZiPiFLZr7uA8HFtBb6BsZXswyMEXUwFGqcyuQsPlSHAw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"deschooling","postDate":"949672624","msgId":6193,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MDMuNjE5My45NTkyNjk3NDZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6175,"nextInTopic":13440,"prevInTime":6192,"nextInTime":6194,"topicId":6175,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"!

We have two toddlers, and will soon be adopting one or <br/>\nmore school age girls from foster care (Our Homestudy is being considered <br/>\nby numerous Case Workers) so I am in need of practical brass tacks &quot;advice <br/>\non what exactly we should be DOING duting the day in terms of fullfilling <br/>\neducational needs. These kids are coming from IS and will most likely need <br/>\nto ease out of that mentality slowly. They will also need time to deschool <br/>\nand heal and adjust menatlly, emotionally and psychologically to their new <br/>\nhome and family.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers don&#39;t believe that there should be something you *should be doing*.  Most don&#39;t believe in imposing learning on our kids.  I define it as child-led learning...which means, if your child wants to daydream, work in textbooks, watch tv, take a class, go to school, create a curriculum, etc, etc, etc.  Then that&#39;s what you should be doing.  It helps to take them places and expose them many different things in order to try to find what may interest them.  When I first took my son out of PS we didn&#39;t do anything for the first year that was even close to looking schoolish.  We joined a homeschool support group and only went to the parties and play dates.  We stayed away from all the classes.  Stephen was so wounded from ps he wanted to stay as far away from it as possible.  We did go to the Children&#39;s Museum in Indianapolis at least once a week because my son loved it.  But I let him run wild and do what he wanted to do....I only read the signs to him if he asked.  It is a very hands on musuem and we miss it very much.  This summer he asked me to teach him to read...so I picked up &quot;100 Easy Lessons&quot; at the library and he seemed to enjoy that.  He even wanted to practice writing the letters at the end of each lesson which really surprised me.  But this is what I believe is child led learning.  To me this is unschooling.  And the first year where we did close to nothing was deschooling.  I have to admit that right now my son would probably not test at the third grade level in reading and math.  He&#39;d probably be higher in other subjects though, especially biology.  But I have no doubts that he will catch up and probably even surpass his peers.  Just as I believe that if I had never put him in PS that he would be already be there.  School made him take a giant step backwards and now we have to do tiny baby steps forwards.  But there is plenty of time and he is definately making progress so I&#39;m not worried.  :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Free voicemail and email, by phone or Web!

If you ask someone...what does this say?  Do you want them to tell you the word is?  Or do want them to say &quot;What do you think&quot;?  Personally I&#39;d be ticked if someone did that to me.  Now...if I ask you what the word is, you tell me and THEN you show me how you sounded it out, that would be cool.  I think the hardest part for us who graduated from traditional schools is the mindset that you have to make the child think for themselves.  That they are lazy and will try to get other people to do all the hard work themselves.  Once you start treating them as people who are eager to learn then they will start behaving that way.  And yes this is easier said then done...you just have to keep reminding yourself and soon it will become a habit.  :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Free voicemail and email, by phone or Web!
