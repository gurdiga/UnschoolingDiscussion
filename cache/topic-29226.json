The 3/4 cup<br/>\nof spices can be changed to a spice or spices of your own choice. Use about<br/>\n1/2 clove and 1/2 cinnamon to make 3/4 cup of spices.<br/>\n<br/>\nMix all ingredients together and knead. If it gets to sticky add more spice,<br/>\nnot the flour.<br/>\n<br/>\n Roll dough out on a well powdered surface using cinnamon not flour.  Roll<br/>\nto 1/2 inch thickness and cut with any cookie cutter of your choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n Poke a small hole in the top of each ornament for hanging on tree (a wooden<br/>\nshish kabob stick works well). Place on baking sheet covered with parchment<br/>\npaper or paper bag.<br/>\n<br/>\nLightly sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake at 350F for about 25 minutes (Time may<br/>\nvary -- depending on your oven and thickness of ornament)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen cool, you can paint and coat with spray acrylic finish. This will cut<br/>\ndown of the fragrance if you spray it with the finish.<br/>\n<br/>\n I usually get about 24 little ornaments out of one batch. I have small 1<br/>\ninch gingerbread man and stars that eldest son made me which we use for<br/>\nsmall size trees. For a regular size tree a normal size cookie cutter works<br/>\nbest.  One year the kidlets made designs and cut the shapes out with one of<br/>\nthose wire things that folks who work in clay use.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:staclarspr@...\">staclarspr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, December 01, 2001 7:53 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] cinnamon/cutouts<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone know how to mix cinnamon with something, and be able to roll<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; out with cookie cutters?

We<br/>\nstill have some of our cinnamin ornaments from three<br/>\nyears ago. I don&#39;t think you have to have it. <br/>\n<br/>\nCombine the applesauce with one cup cinnamon until<br/>\nwell mixed. Add cinnamon a teaspoon at a time until it<br/>\nhas a firm consistency so its easy to roll out but not<br/>\ndry. If I remember correctly I didn&#39;t need all my<br/>\ncinnamon the first time I did it. I found that it work<br/>\nbetter to only cut a few at a time. <br/>\n<br/>\nSmall cookie cutters work best. I have successfully<br/>\ndone some medium sized ones. Prick a hole in the<br/>\ncookie of you want to hang them with a toothpick. Cook<br/>\nthem in an oven at the lowest temperature for about<br/>\ntwo hours. <br/>\n<br/>\nSamantha<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBuy the perfect holiday gifts at Yahoo!
