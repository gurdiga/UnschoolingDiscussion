I&#39;ve listened to both<br/>\nof them for quite awhile now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;ve had the fairly recent experience of having my words seriously<br/>\nmisconstrued along with baseless assumptions about my state of mind - by<br/>\nSandra - that I must be envious of the TV....or jealous that my children<br/>\nattend to it; and the erroneous assumption that because someone else&#39;s<br/>\nmetaphorical description &quot;like a mindless bloog&quot; brought to mind something<br/>\nI&#39;d studied over a decade ago,  I must rely on the results of one study to<br/>\ndirect my decisions;  not to mention the assumption that,  because I<br/>\nunderstand another parent&#39;s struggle with whether or how to limit TV<br/>\nviewing,  that I MUST be using some kind of measures to control my<br/>\nchildren&#39;s behaviors.<br/>\n<br/>\nI respect Sandra&#39;s perspective and experience,  if not always liking her<br/>\nstyle.  I have come to understand from her input here,  that she hopes to<br/>\nenable those newer to unschooling to avoid mistakes she has either<br/>\nexperienced personally or through her relationships with others who&#39;ve<br/>\ntravelled this path.  These are MY words and MY understanding,  which only<br/>\nSandra can clarify.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy recent experience with having my message so distorted leads me to wonder<br/>\nwhether Sandra likes to *rile* (sp?) things up in order to push buttons and<br/>\nkeep the discussion lively.  If so,  she is often effective.  Regardless,  I<br/>\nhave found that whether or not I have time to respond on the list,  I do<br/>\nmore fully articulate my feelings and thoughts on a particular matter and<br/>\nstrengthen my convictions...whether I agree or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise,  early in the TV thread,  I found Bridget&#39;s re-cap of her personal<br/>\nexperience,  along with the wisdom - you know your children, trust your gut<br/>\n(I&#39;m paraphrasing)  to be most beneficial to me.  I think many of us in the<br/>\nthroes of coping with managing young children need to be reminded of basic<br/>\nbits of wisdom from time to time - we probably &#39;know&#39; to trust our gut,  to<br/>\ntrust our children as they grow and learn....But our perspective and judgeme<br/>\nnt get clouded at times in our weariness (Maybe I should only speak for<br/>\nmyself her -?- ).  I appreciate a voice of experience that says...I&#39;ve<br/>\ntravelled a similar road before...you will need to find your own<br/>\nway....trust your instincts (i.e., if you&#39;re led to unschooling,  you<br/>\nprobably have a basic belief in yourself and your children).  I think this<br/>\nis what Bridget tries to do.....again,  these are my words,  I&#39;m not<br/>\nspeaking for Bridget!<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall,  I think we&#39;re fortunate to have both  of you here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;  It appears to me that both of you are putting words in the others<br/>\n&gt; mouths. If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you would each take the time to LISTEN to the other, you would<br/>\n&gt; discover you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; probably are not that far apart on the issue. But instead you take<br/>\n&gt; a portion<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of something the other said and distort it. No one said you were<br/>\n&gt; nuts for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thinking the way you do Sandra, and no one said your family was<br/>\n&gt; chock full of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; badness Bridget. To infer those things from the conversation is<br/>\n&gt; paranoid and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; looking for something to get upset about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. I&#39;m not upset.<br/>\n&gt; 2.  I listen to Sandra.  But I do not and cannot respect the position<br/>\n&gt; that if we would all just do things her way, our problems would<br/>\n&gt; magically go away.  And as recently as this week she has said nearly<br/>\n&gt; that.<br/>\n&gt; 3.  Yes, my family deals with allergies, OCD and depression.  No we<br/>\n&gt; are not discordant, unhappy and frustrated.<br/>\n&gt; 4.  Perhaps those of us who have faced these problems and learned to<br/>\n&gt; deal with them within a framework of respect for individuality have<br/>\n&gt; something to offer that others who have not BTDT cannot simply<br/>\n&gt; because they have not faced the problems and challenges themselves.<br/>\n&gt; 5.  No one has a monopoly on &quot;right&quot;.  I offer examples of how we do<br/>\n&gt; things here.  I offer what worked and what didn&#39;t and why.  I do not<br/>\n&gt; say that everyone has to do exactly what worked for me because it may<br/>\n&gt; not work for the next person.<br/>\n&gt; 6.  I resent being called paranoid when I object to my posts being<br/>\n&gt; answered in such a way as to suggest that my family is dysfunctional.<br/>\n&gt; 7.
