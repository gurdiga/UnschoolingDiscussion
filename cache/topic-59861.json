When my methods are questioned, I always return the <br/>\nquestion ~ where are they lacking??  They&#39;re great kids, I haven&#39;t yet gotten <br/>\na satisfactory response from anyone.  (I used this for almost every freaky <br/>\nparenting decision I&#39;ve made, from no-circ to no vax to extended, on demand <br/>\nbreastfeeding to delaying solids ... unschooling has just confirmed my place <br/>\nin the family&#39;s *Freak Hall of Fame*) <br/>\nWow!

I&#39;ve inquired about what she *thinks* she&#39;s <br/>\nmissing.  She first talked of recess.

I added <br/>\nmore socialization into our life.  I asked about *doing school* does she want <br/>\nme to sit down with her everyday and have lessons?  NO! She likes learning <br/>\nthis way ... it wasn&#39;t more than a few days after this initial conversation <br/>\nthat we were driving and she wished that she and Hayden were twins, so they <br/>\ncould do everything together; thanks for not making me go to school mom, I <br/>\nwould really miss my brother and he would miss me.  This led to a great <br/>\nconversation between the three of us about how important it is to have a <br/>\nloving, trusting family, how lucky we are to have each other and have this <br/>\nopportunity to be together all the time and learn from each other every day.  <br/>\nWill she resent the decision later?

I can&#39;t imagine it.  I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t had to face having a child want to go to school.  My kids are a lot<br/>\nlike me and my dh and I would be surprised if they wanted to.  I would try<br/>\nvery hard to figure out another way to meet whatever need they had that they<br/>\nfelt school would solve, before sending them off.  I also think 5 is kind of<br/>\nyoung to make that choice.  They can&#39;t understand all the consequences of<br/>\ntheir choice yet.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela in <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Maine-unschooling@...\">Maine-unschooling@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://userpages.prexar.com/rickshaw/\">http://userpages.prexar.com/rickshaw/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What you are shouts so loudly in my ears I cannot hear what you say.&quot;<br/>\nEmerson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99497893,"authorName":"Tod and Emily","from":"&quot;Tod and Emily&quot; &lt;todandemily@...&gt;","profile":"emilyandtod","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"An Introduction & ?: How to Stay Strong...","postDate":"1046457409","msgId":59861,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYTEwMWMyZGY1OCQ1YjY3MmU0MCRkNTA5YjczZkBtZXJheW1vbmQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59863,"prevInTime":59860,"nextInTime":59862,"topicId":59861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello!

We<br/>\nlive in rural Humboldt County in Northern CA and love it! I feel very<br/>\ncommitted to be(come)ing an unschooling family--because the public schhols<br/>\nhere are all at least 45mins away and very poor and I had a negative<br/>\nexperience as a child in them, but mostly because it sounds like SUCH fun,<br/>\nand such a way to be close, and just basically in alignment with all my<br/>\ndeeper beliefs...<br/>\n    Maybe I&#39;m just a worrier, but its amazing how much pressure/disapproval<br/>\naround home/unschooling I&#39;m already struggling with (from Serenity&#39;s<br/>\ngrandparents, a few nearby moms I&#39;ve made friends with that I are planning<br/>\nto public school). So my ? is...<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you stay strong in your beliefs and committment to unschooling  in<br/>\nthe face of disapproval?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you fear that your chil will someday resent your descision not to put<br/>\nthem in school like &quot;normal&quot; kids? What do you do with that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel worried by this notion that even though I see that unschooling will<br/>\nbe vastly superior to public schooling, is it really ok to make such a big<br/>\ndecision for someone else? I&#39;ve thought that at age 5 I could have her try a<br/>\nfew days of school and make the choice herself--but what if she wanted to<br/>\nattend? I would hate that, and worry about her so much? Maybe at age 8 or 10<br/>\nthis would feel like a safer plan to me, but then what do I do about all the<br/>\n&quot;So, who&#39;s your kindergarter teacher&quot;comments from well-meaning people at<br/>\nage 5?<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps I&#39;m just seeking some moral support...Thank you all for this amazing<br/>\nlist and in advance for any words of wisdom!  ;)  Emily</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54464,"nextTopicId":59913}}
