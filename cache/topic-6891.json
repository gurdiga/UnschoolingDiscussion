is our motto:), paces when he&#39;s telling a story, loves being\nread to but has flat out refused to learn to read (i think he&#39;s just waiting\nuntil it no longer will require work &lt;g&gt; a rather efficient approach\ni think), he &#39;invents&#39; things, &#39;designs&#39; computer games and robot, mixes\nup &#39;chemical experiments&#39; (i.e. trashes the bathroom:) and is busy at what\nhe&#39;s busy at.&nbsp; he will rarely color, when he does it&#39;s pure &#39;energy&#39;,\nhe won&#39;t try to write, when he paints it&#39;s for 5 mins max. and all the\ncolors end up as one big brown spot &lt;g&gt; but he&#39;s happy and capable just\nnot interested in following some prescribed formula for the best approach\nto learning.&nbsp; when people talk about their kids reading and writing&nbsp;\ni simply tell them: &#39;right now rene&#39; is not at all interested in learning\nthose things&#39;.\n<p>early on i had entertained the ideas set forth by waldorf etc. e.g.&nbsp;\nplay music -which he hated (though that is changing),&nbsp; dolls -which\nhe has no interest at all in, fairies - again could care less, silk scarfs-\nnothing &#39;boring&#39; as he says, stuffed animals sit on his shelves etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nhe likes any and all construction sets, building guns, is not real interested\nin store bought ones,&nbsp; computer software: both games - whoops and\nhollers while playing some squirrel combat/ninja freeware game - and educational\n(the other night he stayed up until midnight to play a german cd from kidspeak\n(transparent language) then the next morning the first thing he did was\nplay the indonesean cd for over an hour- go figure:)\n<p>i&#39;ve just been reading an interview with grace llewelyn.&nbsp; here&#39;s\na quote i think applies to the bigger picture (the &#39;it&#39; refers to her first\nhand experience with unschoolers at her camp &#39;not back to school camp&#39;):&nbsp;&nbsp;\n&#39;it confirms for me that there&#39;s something about unschooling that helps\npeople to really grow as human beings, not just in the narrow, academic\nsense, but just really grow as human beings.&#39;\n<p>this is what, i believe, is at the heart of raising children.&nbsp;\nimo, the reasons schools fail is because they remove the academic component\nfrom its natural context and progression.&nbsp; in an attempt to find that\n&#39;one right way&#39; to learn they strip away all the creative approaches that\nchildren naturally come up with.&nbsp; unschooling is a leap of faith in\nyour child innate curiosity and desire to learn.&nbsp; what this looks\nlike will be utterly unique for each and every child.&nbsp; unfortunately\nour society is so rooted in comparisons and competitions, and strongly\nsets forth the notion of the &#39;one right way&#39; that it is hard to maintain\nthis faith.&nbsp; but then that&#39;s why there are groups like this, to help\nin those time of doubt, which seem to come and go.\n<p>i know this (and most my posts:) is long but one last thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nat first i found rene&#39;s &#39;maleness&#39; so different i tried to curb it.&nbsp;\nthat just compromised our relationship - made him feel controlled which\nwas exactly the truth!&nbsp; so from my experience i would recommend accepting\nhim (ahhd and all but try and forget the labels) and give him lots of opportunity\nto be physical - wear him out (i.e. we have water balloon fights in the\ntub:)&nbsp; a good book is <u>the wonder of boys</u>.&nbsp; for me it help\nto shed some light on this great mystery (for me not for dh he already\ngot it:) and i just learned to work with it rather than change it.&nbsp;\ni think people have the right to develop their true natures.\n<p>best of luck,\n<br>susan\n<br>austin,tx\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p>stormy1986@... wrote:\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote TYPE=\"CITE\">From: stormy1986@...\n<p>I&#39;m having a really hard time letting go right now.&nbsp;
