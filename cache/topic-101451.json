You did your job by taking them to the<br/>\nlibrary and helping her carry any books she chose to the car, and putting<br/>\nthe stars up. Now it is up to her to look at the stars on the ceiling and<br/>\nthe night sky when she wants to, and up to her to choose to read the books<br/>\nor not. Other ways to continue to facilitate that particular interest is to<br/>\n*casually* give her a brochure to the local planetarium, mention a website<br/>\nthat you come across, keep an eye out for new items about imminent meteor<br/>\nshowers or eclipses. It is still *her* interest. <br/>\n<br/>\nNor should she be defined in terms of one overweening passion all the time.<br/>\nSometimes it is tough to look at the totality of a person, if they are seen<br/>\nas the one who is interested in ...... We try not to set up a situation<br/>\nwhere the parent is crushed if/when the child moves on to some other<br/>\ninterest, or that the child feels guilty at abandoning some project or<br/>\nconcern that has become irrelevant to them. Continuing with an interest just<br/>\nto keep Mom happy is not Unschooling with joy. (Not saying this is happening<br/>\nat your house, Julie - just offering a general caution).<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people, when first coming to Unschooling, go overboard and sort of<br/>\n&quot;take over&quot; the organization and pace of exploring an interest - with the<br/>\nbest of intentions - and end up trying to make it more like a unit study.<br/>\nChildren who have fully decompressed from schoolishness, or have been long<br/>\ntime Unschoolers, have been known to tell their mother to &quot;Chill, Mom&quot;. It<br/>\nhas made for some funny stories on the list when Mom realizes what she has<br/>\ndone.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the unfunny consequence can be that the kids become wary of<br/>\nmentioning a new fascination in case it turns into another major undertaking<br/>\nwith undesired cross country field trips. (Don&#39;t take this to mean that I<br/>\ndon&#39;t approve of cross country field trips when they are wanted and endorsed<br/>\nby everyone concerned!) It is kind of like the Mom hi-jacks the kid&#39;s<br/>\ninterest, in desperation to force Unschooling into looking like the<br/>\nschoolish mode of the dominant ideology.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Same for my 6 y.o.  I&#39;ve read some about Ancient <br/>\nEgypt to my now 8 y.o. and the 6 y.o. wanted to hear more about <br/>\nthis.  I don&#39;t want to say No.  And what did you mean about this and <br/>\ncomparing the kids or their activities?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nParaphrasing your first post, I was responding to the idea that you were<br/>\ndisappointed that your 8yo didn&#39;t want to read (sadness and confusion), when<br/>\nyour 6yo did ask you to read to her often (yippee!). It was never to suggest<br/>\nthat you should not read to anyone who asks you to. Ancient Egypt and<br/>\nAstronomy are certainly equally worthy interests! <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you see what I mean by the tacit approval for the *way* your younger<br/>\nchild was choosing to learn, versus your sorrow at the current rejection of<br/>\na skill you value in the elder? If the underlying attitude is informing any<br/>\nof your interactions, it doesn&#39;t have to be as blatant as actually saying,<br/>\n&quot;See, your little sister wants to read, why don&#39;t you&quot; to be felt as<br/>\ncriticism and disapproval.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Thank you again!
