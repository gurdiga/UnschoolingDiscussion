I <br/>\nthink ensuring that a household is safe for everyone is peaceful, <br/>\nand I said in that previous post that I agreed that she needed to <br/>\nphysically intervene to keep people safe. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if a mom is still learning the principles of peaceful parenting, <br/>\nprinciples which also work toward creating a safe household, then I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want her to just forget them.  I wouldn&#39;t want her to throw <br/>\nthose out as unworkable, &quot;because my kids hit and that&#39;s <br/>\ndifferent.&quot;  I think she needs a &quot;both/and&quot; approach, not <br/>\nan &quot;either/or&quot; approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a general principle, when a person is heading towards violence, <br/>\nif you can actively listen to them, and if you can address their <br/>\nneeds (the needs that are driving them to violence) and if you can <br/>\ntreat them like a real person deserving of respect and trust, <br/>\nviolence will often de-escalate.  I&#39;ve seen it work not just in <br/>\nfamilies but at political protests where people and police are <br/>\nstarting to push and shove.  When done well, it has a history of <br/>\nworking between warring factions and in situations that are nearing <br/>\nlitigation. But yes, the ground rule has to be that nobody gets <br/>\nhurt, and that will be enforced.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to get down to specifics, because maybe that will be a more <br/>\nhelpful discussion to the original poster (and others).  This is the <br/>\nkind of intervention that I&#39;ve used in my house, both ensuring <br/>\neveryone&#39;s safety *and* using the principles of peaceful parenting <br/>\nand good (nonviolent) communication:  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mom here might need to insist that one of the children leave the <br/>\nroom, or go to their room or to a private place.  She can say, &quot;You <br/>\nneed to leave (or &quot;we are going to leave the room&quot;) because I cannot <br/>\nlet you hurt your brother/sister.  I wouldn&#39;t let anyone come in <br/>\nhere and hurt you, and I will not let you hurt them.&quot;  She can have <br/>\na backbone and mean it, but at least she&#39;s telling them why it&#39;s <br/>\ngoing on -- that the intent is peaceful.  She can carry someone out <br/>\nif she needs to, and she can do it in a restraining way, <br/>\nnonviolently.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;m very eager to hear about what others would do to enforce the <br/>\nprinciple that nobody gets hurt, since that seems to be where some <br/>\nof the questions are arising.  Would you do more than remove the <br/>\nchild?  Would you take away what they were fighting about, if it <br/>\nwere an item?  I&#39;m asking because I know Karen and Sandra and others <br/>\n*are* experienced at this, so I&#39;d like to learn what they would <br/>\nphysically do to ensure everyone&#39;s safety.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut after she&#39;s made sure everyone else is okay, she can also come <br/>\nback to the child who was hitting or going to hit, with an offering <br/>\nof the child&#39;s favorite drink, perhaps.  If the child is still <br/>\nraging but not hitting, she can sit with the child, just breathing <br/>\nand being there with the child.  If the child is hitting, yes, she <br/>\nneeds to leave.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut when the child is able to talk, the mom doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>\npunitive.  She can sympathize and listen and not focus on the <br/>\nhitting at first, but focus on the emotions and the needs of that <br/>\nchild.  (The mom can share her own emotions -- &quot;you scared me when <br/>\nit looked like you would hit, and I knew I had to stop that.&quot;)  Then <br/>\nthey can talk about ways to handle these feelings and needs other <br/>\nthan hitting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen the reminder that hurting others really isn&#39;t going to fly can <br/>\ncome gently, with ideas about things that will work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I agree with Sandra&#39;s idea about relating the key points to the <br/>\nother person involved -- the parent can act as interpreter and <br/>\nmediator, so the real message is conveyed.<br/>\n<br/>\nFocusing only on the hitting might be focusing on a symptom, not the <br/>\nunderlying cause.  That&#39;s why I think using good communication *as <br/>\nwell* is a good idea.  I found the concepts in nonviolent <br/>\ncommunication to be good ones, but if someone doesn&#39;t like that <br/>\ntitle, if it sounds too politically correct or something, they don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: why you shouldn&#39;t hit mommy","postDate":"1122310948","msgId":107494,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQxLjJkNjkxYTA3LjMwMTY3NTI0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107492,"nextInTopic":107498,"prevInTime":107493,"nextInTime":107495,"topicId":107441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

To me, that says that you may not be<br/>\nbringing in empathy and validation of feelings enough.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, if my son is still annoyed with me, it&#39;s because I<br/>\njumped to pure problem-solving mode too early.  (i.e., &quot;What can we do<br/>\ndifferently?&quot;)  He feels like nobody understands him -- he still wants<br/>\na chance to get his side of the story out and to really be heard and<br/>\nvalidated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe may even have some ideas about how things could go differently, if<br/>\nI would stop popping in with my suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if your kids are saying, &quot;Whatever, if he does that again I&#39;m going<br/>\nto hurt him,&quot; it sounds like they need you to be with them  in that<br/>\nemotional place for a bit.  &quot;It seems just intolerable when he does<br/>\nthat, right?  You can&#39;t stand it, you feel like you&#39;re going to<br/>\nexplode when he does it, you hate it so much.  Is that it or is there<br/>\nsomething else?&quot;  (It can look really gimpy in print, but you can make<br/>\nit sound like a kind friend and not use the sing-song mommy voice at<br/>\nall.)   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then let them keep talking, or correct you, and you just keep<br/>\nvalidating how hard that is for them.  Let them really vent it all to<br/>\nyou as long as they need to, without jumping to the mode of, &quot;Well,<br/>\nthat may be, but we need to fix this.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you can even go so far as, &quot;I can understand that -- if someone<br/>\nwere doing that to me, I&#39;d find it so hard to handle.  I remember once<br/>\nwhen I was a kid ...&quot;   Usually, as I&#39;m talking to my son, I do<br/>\nremember a similar situation happening to me when I was a child, so I<br/>\ntell a brief version of it and I tell how I felt.  I don&#39;t move on to<br/>\n&quot;and the moral of the story is&quot; or anything.  It&#39;s a way to get myself<br/>\nin my child&#39;s head, and for him to realize that mom really does know<br/>\nwhat he&#39;s talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, my kids just melt when I empathize with them and<br/>\nthey feel heard.  That&#39;s the key for them getting out of defensive<br/>\nmode, and *only* when they are out of defensive mode are they open to<br/>\nproblem-solving.  If you move to straight problem-solving mode too<br/>\nsoon, they are being asked to ignore or deny their own feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor that reason, I do think of validating and empathizing as the<br/>\nfirst, key, essential step of problem-solving, though I didn&#39;t specify<br/>\nthat when I first posted about problem-solving.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our house, nothing works without this step.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela S.","from":"&quot;Angela S.&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: why you shouldn&#39;t hit mommy","postDate":"1122294588","msgId":107480,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNzI1MTIyOTQ4LlRHRU0xOTI2Ny5tdGExMC5hZGVscGhpYS5uZXRAU3VnYXI+","inReplyToHeader":"PGRjMThwNCtrOWxkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":107477,"nextInTopic":107483,"prevInTime":107479,"nextInTime":107481,"topicId":107441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I don&#39;t know if you have someone<br/>\nin your life with whom you have a healthy give and take relationship, but if<br/>\nyou do, try to think of how you would interact with them in any given<br/>\ncircumstances and try to carry that over to your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nHard to explain, but they literally got in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; arguments over who got me first (they never wanted to play games<br/>\n&gt; together, they always wanted just my attention one on one) and<br/>\n&gt; demanded my time from the time I got up til the time I got in bed.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is sad that they felt so needy.  I would hope you could spend a little<br/>\none on one time with each of them but also include the other kids in the<br/>\ngames you play.

I&#39;ll tell what<br/>\n&gt; I did, but I wonder if others would handle it differently. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We were swimming at a friend&#39;s house.  Luke (who&#39;s 6) was in a big<br/>\n&gt; inter-tube type thing that he was filling up with water.  He was<br/>\n&gt; handing me the plastic bucket, and I was filling it up with water and<br/>\n&gt; handing it to him.  Matt (who&#39;s 8)had been playing with us but got<br/>\n&gt; sick of it and wanted to get out of the pool.  Luke heard him ask me<br/>\n&gt; to get out of the pool with him and got upset and said in a pleading<br/>\n&gt; kind of voice, &quot;No, don&#39;t get out of the pool, I want you to stay here<br/>\n&gt; with me&quot;.  So I had one boy begging me to stay in with him and one boy<br/>\n&gt; begging me to get out with him.  So I told Matt that I wanted to stay<br/>\n&gt; in with Luke for awhile, but that he could wrap up in a towel and sit<br/>\n&gt; on the deck and talk with us.  Or he could change into dry clothes and<br/>\n&gt; come back down and sit on the deck and be with us.   Or he could go<br/>\n&gt; into the house, where his sister and friend were, and watch tv, play<br/>\n&gt; with toys or video games, get a snack and drink, etc.  Or I would call<br/>\n&gt; his dad, who wouldn&#39;t mind coming to get him and take him home and<br/>\n&gt; hang out with him for awhile.  None of that satisfied him, and he just<br/>\n&gt; insisted that I get out NOW.  He started pulling on me and I just<br/>\n&gt; calmly told him that no, Luke needed me in the pool right now, and<br/>\n&gt; re-stated his options.  I was trying to think of new options that<br/>\n&gt; would satisfy both boys but wasn&#39;t coming up with anything else.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When pulling on me didn&#39;t work, he started hitting and punching. He<br/>\n&gt; said &quot;Come now&quot; over and over.  So I held his hands to keep him from<br/>\n&gt; hitting me, and told him to stop, that I wouldn&#39;t tolerate him hitting<br/>\n&gt; me. But he didn&#39;t stop when I told him to, and I spent probably 15<br/>\n&gt; minutes keeping him from hitting me--telling him no, holding his hands<br/>\n&gt; so he couldn&#39;t hit, until he finally gave up.  He went in and got<br/>\n&gt; changed, got himself a drink, and came out to the pool deck and sat<br/>\n&gt; down and talked to us.  But obviously, what I would like to figure out<br/>\n&gt; is how to avoid that kind of struggle. I shouldn&#39;t have to hold an 8<br/>\n&gt; year old back from hitting me for 15 minutes.  I can do it now, but in<br/>\n&gt; a few years he might be physically stronger than me.   If he had been<br/>\n&gt; the only child who needed me to be doing something with him, then I<br/>\n&gt; would have gotten out of the pool right away with him--but that wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; the case.  I had another child who would have been equally upset if I<br/>\n&gt; HAD gotten out of the pool with Matt.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a similar issue with kids hitting each other.  The fighting<br/>\n&gt; escalated for awhile during the last few months. I&#39;ve told them it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not acceptable.  I&#39;ve told them to come to me when they&#39;re frustrated<br/>\n&gt; and talk to me first before they hit--they sometimes do and they<br/>\n&gt; sometimes don&#39;t.  There is still sometimes hitting and kicking and<br/>\n&gt; crying and &quot;he hit me first&quot; and &quot;he hit me so now I AM going to hit<br/>\n&gt; him back, and don&#39;t try to stop me&quot; and me holding frustrated kids<br/>\n&gt; back and me fervently trying to explain why you shouldn&#39;t hit your<br/>\n&gt; mommy or brother or sister.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once, after a particularly nasty fist fight that involved all 3 kids<br/>\n&gt; including the 12 year old, I just sat them down and said, &quot;Look, you<br/>\n&gt; guys have an incredible amount of freedom and incredible opportunities<br/>\n&gt; to do all kinds of cool things that lots of kids don&#39;t have.  We have<br/>\n&gt; a really cool lifestyle here and when fights like this happen our life<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t anywhere near as fun and nice as it could be for any of us.  If<br/>\n&gt; you want to continue to have the amount of freedom that you have, this<br/>\n&gt; kind of fighting can&#39;t continue.&quot;   I haven&#39;t threatened with a loss<br/>\n&gt; of freedom or privelages for YEARS now, and now here I was saying, &quot;No<br/>\n&gt; fighting or there will be some loss of freedom (I didn&#39;t say what kind<br/>\n&gt; of loss of freedom, just kind of emphasized that the kind of fighting<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s been happening more and more lately simply can&#39;t continue or<br/>\n&gt; (something that I didn&#39;t describe).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not entirely happy with the way I worded it to them, but at the<br/>\n&gt; time it was the best I could come up with.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So they wanted to know &quot;or what&quot; specifically.  What would I do if<br/>\n&gt; they continue to hurt each other?  Would they have to go to school? <br/>\n&gt; Would I start being as strict as some other moms that we know?  What<br/>\n&gt; specifically?  In other words, is it worth it to them to stop hurting<br/>\n&gt; each other?  What are the stakes?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The thing is, they know me well.  They know I won&#39;t send them to<br/>\n&gt; school.  They know I won&#39;t ground them or take away stuff.  They know<br/>\n&gt; I won&#39;t even threaten to.   So I just told them, &quot;Look, let&#39;s not even<br/>\n&gt; talk about what I *could* do.  You know I don&#39;t want to make you go to<br/>\n&gt; school or get real strict with you.  But this is important.  I<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be making this big of a deal about it if it isn&#39;t.  As a<br/>\n&gt; family, it&#39;s important to all of us to have a home where people don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get hurt, so let&#39;s just all work toward having this be a place where<br/>\n&gt; people don&#39;t have to worry about getting hurt because that&#39;s a good<br/>\n&gt; deal for everyone&quot;.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And since that talk, things *have* been better.  I&#39;m still breaking up<br/>\n&gt; fights every once in awhile, and still every once in awhile saying,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Remember, it&#39;s just not acceptable to hit even if you&#39;re (angry,<br/>\n&gt; frustrated, etc.).  It&#39;s not okay to threaten to dump soda on your<br/>\n&gt; sister&#39;s head, it&#39;s not okay to hit him because he threatened to dump<br/>\n&gt; soda on your head, it&#39;s not okay to hit her because she hit you<br/>\n&gt; because you threatened to dump soda on your head.  And I&#39;m still<br/>\n&gt; sometimes hearing &quot;I&#39;m going to hit him no matter what you say, and<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s not my brother&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Matt said to me, &quot;Mom, you told me not to hit my brother and not to<br/>\n&gt; annoy him so that he wants to hit me.  But when you tell me that, YOU<br/>\n&gt; annoy me.  I don&#39;t LIKE you telling me that.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But so far I&#39;ve been able to keep things from escalating into anything<br/>\n&gt; big.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thoughts? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sheila </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: why you shouldn&#39;t hit mommy","postDate":"1122265366","msgId":107472,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJlLjJkNjVkMWQzLjMwMTVjMzE2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107470,"nextInTopic":107477,"prevInTime":107471,"nextInTime":107473,"topicId":107441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/24/2005 2:39:23 PM Central Standard Time, sheran@ptd.net writes: What do  you do if you give all the suggestions you can think of, and ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-213374296\">In a message dated 7/24/2005 2:39:23 PM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheran@...\">sheran@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do  you do if you give all the suggestions you can think of, and<br/>\nthey say &quot;Yes,  but it didn&#39;t work&quot; and then they say, &quot;So if you can&#39;t<br/>\ngive me any  suggestions that I like, then I&#39;m going to hurt him&quot;?   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t have a bit of trouble with &quot;No, you&#39;re not.

Heavens, no. ;)  <br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously though, I wish I would have been an unschooler/attachment <br/>\nparenting/gentle parenting mom from the beginning. About 10 years ago <br/>\nthere was a period of about 2 years, starting right around the time <br/>\nmy oldest daughter was 4 and my middle child was born, when I got so <br/>\ninvolved in church work that I might as well have been working full <br/>\ntime.  I nursed the baby and took care of the basics, and did school-<br/>\nat-home with the oldest but didn&#39;t play *with* them much at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I eventually became an unschooler and swung in the opposite <br/>\ndirection so extremely that I kind of made myself a servant to them. <br/>\nI took the &quot;try not to say no&quot; advice too literally because I didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow how to have personal limits and didn&#39;t know how to do anything <br/>\nnice for myself.  Hard to explain, but they literally got in <br/>\narguments over who got me first (they never wanted to play games <br/>\ntogether, they always wanted just my attention one on one) and <br/>\ndemanded my time from the time I got up til the time I got in bed.  <br/>\nLike the first words out of each child&#39;s mouth in the morning would <br/>\nbe asking me if I would play a game with just him before I played a <br/>\ngame with anyone else, and then the next person would claim the next <br/>\ntime slot, and before the day would even be started I&#39;d be filled up <br/>\nwith promises to do stuff with them, often with more promised than I <br/>\ncould possibly accomplish and me not getting enough sleep trying to <br/>\nget everything done.  I took NO time for myself for quite awhile, <br/>\nliterally just giving into demands all day, every day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen people on this list started talking about moms having their own <br/>\ninterests, and I didn&#39;t understand how anyone could have their own <br/>\ninterests and be an unschooler.  I figured anything I was interested <br/>\nin would have to wait until the kids were grown. And my homeopath <br/>\nstarted talking about respecting myself and loving myself--totally <br/>\nnew concepts for me that took awhile to adjust to.  So I started <br/>\nfinding things I was interested in, and had to adjust and learn to <br/>\nbalance time for myself with time for the kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re finding that balance, and things are pretty good, except that <br/>\nsometimes, at least once a day--if we have a day with no fighting <br/>\nit&#39;s rare--I&#39;m dealing with fighting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I&#39;m present with them for a good part of the day now.  But <br/>\nsometimes now, after I&#39;ve done stuff for and with them for several <br/>\nhours, I take a book of my own and sit and read it, or ask for some <br/>\nuninterrupted internet time, or go to the park and do some writing of <br/>\nmy own, or get together with one of my friends.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I spent the first 5 years of my kids&#39; lives on the floor with them <br/>\n </span></blockquote>or in the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; same room tuned into what they were doing.

I didn&#39;t have <br/>\nthe internet when I was pregnant with my first--if I had, gosh, life <br/>\nwould have been different.  The road to unschooling was NOT an easy <br/>\nroad for us.

They don&#39;t argue back at you?  &quot;That&#39;s not<br/>\nfair&quot; or &quot;But he&#39;s a jerk&quot; or anything?

They<br/>\nleave angry at ME because I made them stop fighting, and not because I<br/>\ndon&#39;t give them lots of sympathy and empathy and understanding.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think a big reason why the fighting has escalated is because I got<br/>\nfrustrated and felt that *I* couldn&#39;t deal with anymore so I just<br/>\nstarted walking away.  AND because after I&#39;ve been doing stuff for<br/>\nother people for 6, 7 hours with no break for time for myself, I&#39;m<br/>\nready to just walk away and say ENOUGH!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that just walking away isn&#39;t the answer, and I can see that the<br/>\nresult of doing that is even more fighting.  It&#39;s just tiring!   And<br/>\nyeah, I know that parenting can be tiring.  I just wonder if I get<br/>\nmore tired from it than most people, if my kids have a tendency to<br/>\nfight more than other kids, if I just have to keep perservering, etc.<br/>\n  I know people who have sent their kids to school because they<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t stand the fighting and needed the time for themselves and I<br/>\nknow *that&#39;s* not the answer for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be helpful to be a fly on the wall of other<br/>\nhouseholds sometimes. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: why you shouldn&#39;t hit mommy","postDate":"1122220918","msgId":107461,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU0LjQ4Y2I0MTFlLjMwMTUxNTc2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107460,"nextInTopic":107464,"prevInTime":107460,"nextInTime":107462,"topicId":107441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That&#39;s because usually, by age 8, a child is hitting out of<br/>\nfrustration at not being heard or having needs met -- because there<br/>\nisn&#39;t enough problem-solving going on.  (As opposed to the hitting<br/>\nkids will do at 2 or 3, when they&#39;re gauging the reaction of others<br/>\nand their language skills just aren&#39;t up to their communication skills<br/>\nyet -- a different kind of frustration.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the fighting going on, are you present with the kids,<br/>\nhelping them problem-solve as they&#39;re playing?  Or are you in another<br/>\nroom and only coming in when a problem breaks out?  That can make a<br/>\nworld of difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t read it already, you might find _Siblings Without<br/>\nRivalry_ a good read (and an easy one, too) about facilitating better<br/>\ncommunication and problem-solving.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy Hill","from":"Betsy Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Unschooling limits","postDate":"1122175420","msgId":107447,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyRTMwOUJDLjcwMTAwMDZAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRidWdyMCtla2syQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRidWdyMCtla2syQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":107446,"nextInTopic":107448,"prevInTime":107446,"nextInTime":107448,"topicId":107441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**Mindful parenting is about being a child s partner rather than their adversary.

I&#39;ll tell what<br/>\nI did, but I wonder if others would handle it differently. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were swimming at a friend&#39;s house.  Luke (who&#39;s 6) was in a big<br/>\ninter-tube type thing that he was filling up with water.  He was<br/>\nhanding me the plastic bucket, and I was filling it up with water and<br/>\nhanding it to him.  Matt (who&#39;s 8)had been playing with us but got<br/>\nsick of it and wanted to get out of the pool.  Luke heard him ask me<br/>\nto get out of the pool with him and got upset and said in a pleading<br/>\nkind of voice, &quot;No, don&#39;t get out of the pool, I want you to stay here<br/>\nwith me&quot;.  So I had one boy begging me to stay in with him and one boy<br/>\nbegging me to get out with him.  So I told Matt that I wanted to stay<br/>\nin with Luke for awhile, but that he could wrap up in a towel and sit<br/>\non the deck and talk with us.  Or he could change into dry clothes and<br/>\ncome back down and sit on the deck and be with us.   Or he could go<br/>\ninto the house, where his sister and friend were, and watch tv, play<br/>\nwith toys or video games, get a snack and drink, etc.  Or I would call<br/>\nhis dad, who wouldn&#39;t mind coming to get him and take him home and<br/>\nhang out with him for awhile.  None of that satisfied him, and he just<br/>\ninsisted that I get out NOW.  He started pulling on me and I just<br/>\ncalmly told him that no, Luke needed me in the pool right now, and<br/>\nre-stated his options.  I was trying to think of new options that<br/>\nwould satisfy both boys but wasn&#39;t coming up with anything else.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen pulling on me didn&#39;t work, he started hitting and punching. He<br/>\nsaid &quot;Come now&quot; over and over.  So I held his hands to keep him from<br/>\nhitting me, and told him to stop, that I wouldn&#39;t tolerate him hitting<br/>\nme. But he didn&#39;t stop when I told him to, and I spent probably 15<br/>\nminutes keeping him from hitting me--telling him no, holding his hands<br/>\nso he couldn&#39;t hit, until he finally gave up.  He went in and got<br/>\nchanged, got himself a drink, and came out to the pool deck and sat<br/>\ndown and talked to us.  But obviously, what I would like to figure out<br/>\nis how to avoid that kind of struggle. I shouldn&#39;t have to hold an 8<br/>\nyear old back from hitting me for 15 minutes.  I can do it now, but in<br/>\na few years he might be physically stronger than me.   If he had been<br/>\nthe only child who needed me to be doing something with him, then I<br/>\nwould have gotten out of the pool right away with him--but that wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthe case.  I had another child who would have been equally upset if I<br/>\nHAD gotten out of the pool with Matt.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a similar issue with kids hitting each other.  The fighting<br/>\nescalated for awhile during the last few months. I&#39;ve told them it&#39;s<br/>\nnot acceptable.  I&#39;ve told them to come to me when they&#39;re frustrated<br/>\nand talk to me first before they hit--they sometimes do and they<br/>\nsometimes don&#39;t.  There is still sometimes hitting and kicking and<br/>\ncrying and &quot;he hit me first&quot; and &quot;he hit me so now I AM going to hit<br/>\nhim back, and don&#39;t try to stop me&quot; and me holding frustrated kids<br/>\nback and me fervently trying to explain why you shouldn&#39;t hit your<br/>\nmommy or brother or sister.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce, after a particularly nasty fist fight that involved all 3 kids<br/>\nincluding the 12 year old, I just sat them down and said, &quot;Look, you<br/>\nguys have an incredible amount of freedom and incredible opportunities<br/>\nto do all kinds of cool things that lots of kids don&#39;t have.  We have<br/>\na really cool lifestyle here and when fights like this happen our life<br/>\nisn&#39;t anywhere near as fun and nice as it could be for any of us.  If<br/>\nyou want to continue to have the amount of freedom that you have, this<br/>\nkind of fighting can&#39;t continue.&quot;   I haven&#39;t threatened with a loss<br/>\nof freedom or privelages for YEARS now, and now here I was saying, &quot;No<br/>\nfighting or there will be some loss of freedom (I didn&#39;t say what kind<br/>\nof loss of freedom, just kind of emphasized that the kind of fighting<br/>\nthat&#39;s been happening more and more lately simply can&#39;t continue or<br/>\n(something that I didn&#39;t describe).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not entirely happy with the way I worded it to them, but at the<br/>\ntime it was the best I could come up with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo they wanted to know &quot;or what&quot; specifically.  What would I do if<br/>\nthey continue to hurt each other?  Would they have to go to school? <br/>\nWould I start being as strict as some other moms that we know?  What<br/>\nspecifically?  In other words, is it worth it to them to stop hurting<br/>\neach other?  What are the stakes?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, they know me well.  They know I won&#39;t send them to<br/>\nschool.  They know I won&#39;t ground them or take away stuff.  They know<br/>\nI won&#39;t even threaten to.   So I just told them, &quot;Look, let&#39;s not even<br/>\ntalk about what I *could* do.  You know I don&#39;t want to make you go to<br/>\nschool or get real strict with you.  But this is important.  I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be making this big of a deal about it if it isn&#39;t.  As a<br/>\nfamily, it&#39;s important to all of us to have a home where people don&#39;t<br/>\nget hurt, so let&#39;s just all work toward having this be a place where<br/>\npeople don&#39;t have to worry about getting hurt because that&#39;s a good<br/>\ndeal for everyone&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd since that talk, things *have* been better.  I&#39;m still breaking up<br/>\nfights every once in awhile, and still every once in awhile saying,<br/>\n&quot;Remember, it&#39;s just not acceptable to hit even if you&#39;re (angry,<br/>\nfrustrated, etc.).  It&#39;s not okay to threaten to dump soda on your<br/>\nsister&#39;s head, it&#39;s not okay to hit him because he threatened to dump<br/>\nsoda on your head, it&#39;s not okay to hit her because she hit you<br/>\nbecause you threatened to dump soda on your head.  And I&#39;m still<br/>\nsometimes hearing &quot;I&#39;m going to hit him no matter what you say, and<br/>\nhe&#39;s not my brother&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nMatt said to me, &quot;Mom, you told me not to hit my brother and not to<br/>\nannoy him so that he wants to hit me.  But when you tell me that, YOU<br/>\nannoy me.  I don&#39;t LIKE you telling me that.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut so far I&#39;ve been able to keep things from escalating into anything<br/>\nbig.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts? <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"jfetteroll","from":"&quot;jfetteroll&quot; &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling limits","postDate":"1122158240","msgId":107441,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRidWdyMCtla2syQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":107443,"prevInTime":107440,"nextInTime":107442,"topicId":107441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**the closest I could  come to were the families where the mother is calmly telling her child  why he/she shouldn t hit mommy ---but that is not what ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1078739596\">**the closest I could  come to were the families where the mother is<br/>\ncalmly telling <br/>\nher child  why he/she shouldn&#39;t hit mommy ---but that is not what<br/>\nunschooling is  <br/>\nabout, correct? And I&#39;m not talking about unschooling in an academic <br/>\nway but within <br/>\nthe family as a whole.**<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is strictly speaking not doing school.

Sometimes it&#39;s<br/>\ncalled mindful parenting. It <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have an official name unfortunately! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, yes, it goes well beyond saying &quot;This is why you<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t hit mommy ...&quot; ;-<br/>\n)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s treating kids the way fellow human being appreciate being<br/>\ntreated. It&#39;s helping <br/>\nthem get what they want. It&#39;s being their partner as they explore<br/>\nthe world.<br/>\n<br/>\n**I was wondering what type, if any, limits  are there ---do y&#39;all<br/>\nset? What do you not <br/>\napprove of? Perhaps there is  nothing and I am still not seeing<br/>\neverything in the <br/>\nsame way.**<br/>\n<br/>\nWith traditional parenting parents and children are adversaries.<br/>\nParents decide what <br/>\nthe child must and must not do.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Good&quot; (traditional) parents are reasonable in their<br/>\nexpectations. But the relationship <br/>\nis about the parents holding all the power and letting the kids do<br/>\nwhat the parents <br/>\napprove of.<br/>\n<br/>\nMindful parenting is about being a child&#39;s partner rather than<br/>\ntheir adversary. It&#39;s <br/>\nabout helping them get what they want rather than finding techniques<br/>\nto make them <br/>\ndo what the parent wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately that explanation works better after someone understands<br/>\nmindful <br/>\nparenting because after reading that explanation some people will ask<br/>\n&quot;So you&#39;re <br/>\nsaying that if your child wanted to play in traffic you&#39;d let<br/>\nthem?!&quot; ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst kids may want to play but they *also* want to be safe and they<br/>\ntrust us to <br/>\nkeep them safe. So we&#39;d help them play *and* be safe. That could<br/>\nmean distraction <br/>\nto something even better. Saying &quot;The cars will hurt you in the<br/>\nstreet. Hey, let&#39;s go <br/>\ndo the slide.&quot; If they&#39;re very young and can&#39;t stay away<br/>\nfrom the street then it&#39;s best <br/>\nto avoid places like that until they are able to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n(It&#39;s much easier to explain with real examples because the<br/>\nanswer will come from <br/>\nwhy a child wants to do something rather than what they want to do.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there isn&#39;t a &quot;let&quot;. There&#39;s helping a child get<br/>\nwhat they really want (and avoid <br/>\nwhat they don&#39;t want and perhaps don&#39;t understand.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, sometimes kids do want something that we *think* will be<br/>\nunsafe: lots of <br/>\nsweets, lots of TV, video games, horror movies, violent video games,<br/>\nmovies with <br/>\nadult content.<br/>\n<br/>\nThousands of words have been written about trusting kids with food<br/>\nand tv and <br/>\nvideo games! (Sandra has some collected at her website<br/>\n(http://sandradodd.com/<br/>\nunschooling) Basically the idea is to help kids be happy :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nA brief summary of the TV debate is that if kids are given the<br/>\nfreedom to watch as <br/>\nmuch as they want whenever they want they will turn it off when<br/>\nthey&#39;re done.<br/>\n<br/>\n(There are a bunch of caveats: *If* there are better options for<br/>\nthem. (In other words <br/>\nas long as TV isn&#39;t the least boring option. They need to have<br/>\nchoices that *they* <br/>\nfind interesting.) *If* their TV viewing hasn&#39;t been controlled<br/>\nbefore. *If* they don&#39;t <br/>\nfear that limits will be placed on how much they can watch. *If* they<br/>\naren&#39;t <br/>\nprepubescent ;-) (My daughter watched a *lot* of TV when she was 10<br/>\nand 11. But I <br/>\ntrusted her and whatever she needed she got out of it and moved onto<br/>\nother <br/>\ninterests.)<br/>\n<br/>\nA more illustrative example might be a child who wants to watch a<br/>\nhorror movie. How <br/>\ndo you help them get that when you fear they may have nightmares or<br/>\nit might be <br/>\ntoo scary? Do you just &quot;let them&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo. Kids want to be happy so we *help* them. And the first best way<br/>\nis by <br/>\nunderstanding and knowing them. My daughter liked fantasy action<br/>\nmovies but she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like moving skeletons. So before seeing a movie I&#39;d<br/>\ncheck with the Screen It! <br/>\n(http://www.screenit.com) website. (The front page makes it look like<br/>\nyou have to <br/>\npay but you can go right in. Becoming a member just gets it the site<br/>\nad free and <br/>\nsome other extras.) They give good details of what a movie contains<br/>\nthat might <br/>\nbother a child. I&#39;d summarize the things that might bother her<br/>\nand if she still wanted <br/>\nto see it I&#39;d memorize where in the movie it was and remind her<br/>\nto close her eyes <br/>\nwhen we got to that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child has nightmares, there&#39;s lots of other options than<br/>\nwatching a scary movie <br/>\nstraight through right before bed! So we empower them :-) Let them<br/>\nknow they can <br/>\nwatch it during the day, leave and go do something else, stop the<br/>\nmovie, fast <br/>\nforward, pause and talk about it, watch the &quot;making of&quot; to<br/>\nsee how the special <br/>\neffects are done.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe empower kids by helping them figure out how to have control over<br/>\nthe things that <br/>\nmight bother them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat often doesn&#39;t make sense to people who have controlled their<br/>\nkids because <br/>\nthey &quot;know&quot; their kids aren&#39;t reasonable. They might say<br/>\n&quot;No, you can&#39;t see it. The <br/>\nmovie has zombies in it and you know you know zombies give you<br/>\nnightmares.&quot; And <br/>\na controlled child might fight to watch the movie, convincing the<br/>\nparent that the child <br/>\nhas no common sense so the parent obviously must make decisions for<br/>\nthe child.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s not that the child is unreasonable but that the child<br/>\nwants to be able to <br/>\nchoose for themselves. If they&#39;re used to fighting for the right<br/>\nto choose, they&#39;ll fight <br/>\neven for things they don&#39;t entirely want ;-) They just want the<br/>\npower to decide for <br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids&#39; worlds are divided between what they&#39;re allowed to<br/>\ndo and what they <br/>\naren&#39;t allowed to do, they will want to do what they aren&#39;t<br/>\nallowed. (Partly it&#39;s wanting <br/>\nto prove that they can handle what someone thinks they can&#39;t.<br/>\nPartly it&#39;s wanting <br/>\nthe ability to make their own choices.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when kids&#39; worlds are divided between what they want to do<br/>\nand what they don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to do there isn&#39;t any reason for them to choose what they<br/>\ndon&#39;t want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the &quot;short&quot; version, anyway ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107640,"nextTopicId":107639}}
