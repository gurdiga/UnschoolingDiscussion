I told him they were ATM machines that grownups use to get money out of the bank. He asked if kids could too and I told him that most kids don&#39;t have money in the bank, because they have to work to get money and then save it and then they can put it in the bank, so no. He then said &quot;I want my own money.&quot; I said we&#39;d need to talk to daddy to see what special jobs we could find for him to make money.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we left he said he wanted to borrow a movie from Blockbuster. I asked him where his money is and he said he didn&#39;t have any. So I offered a deal. I&#39;d rent the movie for him and when we get home he would vaccum the bathroom and the kitchen to pay for the movie. He agreed. He rented Walking with Dinasours...which he has seen before. When we got home he vaccumed the bathroom, but balked a bit at the kitchen. He was tired and it seemed really big, so I helped him some. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll this simply to ask others what you do to encourage work ethic and to help them learn the value of money. Also, should I be surprised at his desire at this age? He&#39;s only 3.5.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth--in Georgia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48956,"nextTopicId":48969}}
