When <br/>\nI gave them up, I was stunned how many things had  white flour in them.  I <br/>\nhave had to find whole wheat pastas and crackers.  Also, corn is a common <br/>\nallergen, too.  I hated to give up the corn chips, but they had to go.  Are <br/>\nyou noticing any changes in your asthmatic symptoms?  If not, try to be <br/>\npatient as your system is adapting to the changes in the diet.  It is not <br/>\nunusual to feel worse before  better; but, I hope you are feeling better. <br/>\n~Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10753,"nextTopicId":10749}}
