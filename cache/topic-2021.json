There is something<br/>\nspiritual and special about the handwritten word.  I use a fountain pen to<br/>\nwrite in my journal.  I find my mind relaxes more and opens up when I&#39;m<br/>\nwriting in this manner as opposed to sitting in front of the computer.<br/>\nAnother bonus is that I can take my pen and journal outside in the gazebo,<br/>\nunder a tree or by a soothing body of water, which I can&#39;t do with a<br/>\ncomputer (well maybe with a laptop, but YKWIM!).  I also agree with whomever<br/>\nsaid spelling is important.  This is one of my pet peeves, poor spelling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is very good with grammar and sentence structure.  He attributes<br/>\nthat to a year spent in school in England. He says they were much more<br/>\nparticular about this than American schools.  He points out that there is no<br/>\n&quot;grammar and usage check&quot; on computers so knowing this is important<br/>\nregardless.  He is always amazed when he receives business correspondence<br/>\nwith poor grammar.  Things such as the misuse of &quot;your&quot; and &quot;you&#39;re,&quot; &#39;to&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;too,&quot; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa, your post regarding giftedness not mattering once we&#39;re grown up<br/>\nwas right on track.  However, I do feel there are some adults that do still<br/>\nstand out as &quot;gifted.&quot;  These are the adults that make a difference in their<br/>\nlives and the lives of others.  Many of them are still &quot;average Joes/Janes&quot;<br/>\nbut have that extra &quot;spark.&quot;  Yes, you can&#39;t tell who walked at 8 months and<br/>\nwho read at age 3 but you can tell who loves what they do and do it with a<br/>\npassion and those that have a special skill or talent and use it to the best<br/>\nof their ability and to do good works.  On the other hand, these &quot;gifted&quot;<br/>\nadults may have been the kids in the remedial reading programs or labeled LD<br/>\nor some such thing and grew to achieve above their label.
