Why the hell do ya think we are <br/>\nunschoolers?<br/>\nOf course we&#39;re all completely, totally, 100% aware of the damage schools <br/>\ncause. We are all fully aware of politics too. Some of us are politically <br/>\nactive, others (like myself) are too busy with young at-the-breast babies to <br/>\nspend time and energy with that type of activity....and others may not be the <br/>\npolitically active type. We all contribute in our OWN way!! What a concept!!<br/>\nKind of like respecting our childrens various gifts and talents. We all have <br/>\ndifferent things to contribute to unschoolers and the world in general.<br/>\nSome speak at conferences and spend oodles of time on frustrating email lists <br/>\nto try and help other people.<br/>\nJust because being politically active is YOUR  calling does not make the rest <br/>\nof us idiots that don&#39;t know what the hell is going on out there.<br/>\nOur wish to keep the focus of the list in line with the list OWNER is <br/>\nrespectful!!!<br/>\nGet a load of respect for the purpose of the list, would you!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen, fed up and out of patience.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42096,"nextTopicId":42182}}
