But <br/>\nlooking through the schedule, I see that early in the morning you have half <br/>\nan hour to exercise (with kids nearby) and then you don&#39;t get any time alone <br/>\nagain til 10 pm, when you can take a bath and read. That is a long day! I <br/>\nhave 2 kids, 1 in ps first grade, the other is 2 years old and not in school <br/>\nyet.... I also work and I often find myself feeling drained and tapped out. <br/>\nWhat do you do to recharge your batteries? Is time alone to think, shop, <br/>\npamper yourself a little important at all? Do you always feel obligated to <br/>\nwait until everyone else&#39;s day is over before you do something for yourself? <br/>\nI would like to hear from any and all on this subject. How do we get time <br/>\nalone and away from the kids, husbands, housework, etc. to do things for <br/>\nourselves?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7415,"nextTopicId":7365}}
