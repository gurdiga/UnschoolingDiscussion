Right?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know people here in town that are horrible role models that have chosen <br/>\nteaching. <br/>\nThe problem is that not all teachers are monsters but a good many have shown <br/>\nthat there are more bad ones than there should be.<br/>\nMy sister is dealing with one in UT right now. She is verbally abusive daily <br/>\nand making kids carry heavy items as a punishment. Then asking my sisters <br/>\ndaughter AFTER she was told to knock it off , &quot;Well if your hands hurt so bad <br/>\nthen how did you do PE?&quot; Due process, my ass, fire her now! This is Public <br/>\nschool funded by the people it is wrong!<br/>\n<br/>\nI look at it this way if one cannot teach and uphold the contract they signed <br/>\nget off the chalk board and find a different profession. Oh but wait....they <br/>\nwould make less.....<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I want is the funds the school got to keep my son in the resource room to <br/>\nforce him read Dick and Jane. <br/>\nI should have my salary doubled cuz he is reading novels now.
