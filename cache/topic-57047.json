And it&#39;s at least a career that allows time off at holidays, out of <br/>\nwork by 2:00 every day(school starts early here), and summer home with the <br/>\nfamily.  <br/>\nbtw, most of our course work in Ed was about paperwork, classroom management, <br/>\nand lesson plans.  Never actually learned how to &quot;teach&quot; anything anyways, <br/>\nthat stuff is common sense.  Also, that woman might not of had to leave her <br/>\nchild in daycare to get the degree.  I did mine at night, it took 2 years part <br/>\ntime of 1-2 nights a week.  Seems most grad classes around here aren&#39;t in a <br/>\ntypical all day M-F setting like undergrad.   <br/>\nI wonder what she would think if she knew how much we&#39;ve been discussing <br/>\nthis?
