I&#39;m a 28 y/o SAHM of <br/>\nfour children. Sarah is 8; Logan is 4; Megan is nearly 3; and Gracie <br/>\nis 10 months old. <br/>\n<br/>\nThings have been absolutely nuts, and I had to take a break from <br/>\nthings for awhile. Sarah went back to school during that time, and <br/>\nfinishes up on Monday. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that she is home again and we&#39;re moving we&#39;re looking to put <br/>\neverything behind us and move on with our lives. Paul is not wild <br/>\nabout us unschooling, but as it is Sarah has asked to do certain <br/>\nthings that are more schoolish. I&#39;d love to try to persuade her <br/>\nagainst anything schoolish, but I&#39;m having to remember that it&#39;s HER <br/>\nlife and if she wants to do some things in &quot;that&quot; way that it&#39;s <br/>\nalright as it&#39;s her choice. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo things are settling down again finally, and I thought I&#39;d head <br/>\nback this way! I&#39;ve missed the discussions here! <br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95853,"nextTopicId":95869}}
