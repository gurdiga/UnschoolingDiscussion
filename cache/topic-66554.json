One minute you say you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1154980158\">I&#39;ve changed the subject line, but Idon&#39;t think that will help, at all.  <br/>\nBecause you asked, I am offering MY opinion, so here goes.....<br/>\n<br/>\nOne minute you say you &quot;don&#39;t get it&quot;.  The next minute, you scream you do.  <br/>\nYou have been asked not to post, yet you can&#39;t seem to help yourself from <br/>\ndoing so.  You blabber on about how we think you are a &quot;fake liar&quot;, which I <br/>\nNEVER saw anything of the liking posted.  You think EVERYONE who isn&#39;t <br/>\ncoddling you through this is being negative and ONLY talking about MATH <br/>\nPHOBIA.  This is NOT about math phobia, it is about your intense desire to <br/>\npush, push, push GLENA&#39;S WANTS and not your child&#39;s.  If I have to go back <br/>\nand RE-post what you wrote to Sandra I will, but instead, go back and read <br/>\nwhat you said to her.  Your post screamed sarcasm in an attempt to &quot;thank&quot; <br/>\nher.  THAT was immature!  Asking for help, GETTING help and REFUSING to TRY <br/>\nit, imho is immature.  Rambling on and on and on about how you understand, <br/>\nwhich clearly you do not, then screaming that &quot;OH, I GET IT, REALLY I DO&quot;, <br/>\n*then* asking for us to explain it to you another million times, s immature.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is clear to me that you are seeking instruction.  Sandra GAVE you links <br/>\nfor &#39;instruction&#39; in unschooling.  That wasn&#39;t good enough.  You seek a <br/>\nteacher to guide you through this process to YOUR liking, well, obviously <br/>\nnone of us can do that unless we slip in a game for you to disguise the fact <br/>\nthat you WANT for your children to LOVE learning this and that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you STILL don&#39;t get it, don&#39;t ask ME again, because I have nothing left <br/>\nto offer you in the present state you are in.  *I* think you enjoy argueing <br/>\nmoot points more than *listening* to golden gems.  But this isn&#39;t about me, <br/>\nit&#39;s about YOU!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You know, I have tried really hard to be understanding of your frustration <br/>\n&gt;but this is such an immature response.  I almost want to ask you if you <br/>\n&gt;WANT us to say those things.  Good grief, take Sandra&#39;s advice, please!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK, explain to me how/why it&#39;s immature?  I certainly DON&#39;T get it.  I am<br/>\nmore than willing to &quot;listen&quot; to what you have to say about it, just give me<br/>\nspecifics, not just blank negativity.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena who is wondering how the posts are being READ but the subject line <br/>\nthat<br/>\nwas changed yesterday is still the same?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
