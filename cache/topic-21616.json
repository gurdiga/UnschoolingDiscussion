My daughter went to public pre and K.   While in K she<br/>\nwould mention continuously &quot;so and so got in trouble today&quot;. It seemed as if<br/>\nher attention was on those being punished instead of those being taught. <br/>\nThat and some personal decisions were our pull to homeschool.<br/>\nIf you can, get your dh to read some of the books that were suggested -<br/>\n&quot;just to get his opinion&quot; - they love to give it.  I am sure it will open<br/>\nhis eyes and his memory bank to the failings of ps.<br/>\nAs far as the financial stuff goes.  When we made the decision to<br/>\nhomeschool, I made the decision to give up my position as a General Manager<br/>\n- tough/easy decision.  Tough because I had worked extremely hard to get<br/>\nwere I was and I was doing very well (pride issue).  Easy once the decision<br/>\nwas made and my husband told me &quot; I will support you in any way possible&quot;. <br/>\nI still had to work.  We couldn&#39;t afford to live on one income because of<br/>\nthe child support that we paid for my husband&#39;s two children.  Believe it or<br/>\nnot, I stepped from my position as manager and became a shift manager.  My<br/>\nschedule was more flexible.  I worked when dh was at home.  About 2 years<br/>\nago I quit working at the restaraunt and chose to work in a grocery store. <br/>\nBest decision I ever made.  The hours are flexible - they are opened 24<br/>\nhours.  I work at HyVee.  I am sure there are some in Illinois.  The pay was<br/>\nless, but they have  been so good about working around my schedule.  If you<br/>\nare what they consider a regular time employee they offer insurance, etc. <br/>\nTheir insurance is actually better than the insurance I had when I was<br/>\nworking 60 hours at the restaraunt.  What I am trying to say is &quot;where<br/>\nthere&#39;s a will, there&#39;s a way.&quot;  <br/>\nIt will probably seem hectic at first - switching from going to work, to<br/>\nstaying at home.  You will need to make some personal sacrifices - sleep<br/>\nschedule, juggling activities between dh and dw.  I can tell you, it&#39;s worth<br/>\nit.  We do not have the added expense of child care and we do not have the<br/>\nexposure to every strain of colds/viruses that usually pass through daycare.<br/>\nSit down with your dh and look at it  $$$ wise.  The $300 I was paying for<br/>\nchildcare for 2 children was just about the difference of pay cut between me<br/>\ngoing from salary to hourly.  Plus my children were with me.  We did go<br/>\nthrough the owning only one car and driving each other back and forth - some<br/>\nof those times were our best conversation and planning times.   This is just<br/>\na suggestion.  Good Luck!!!<br/>\nI do wish to add that the best way to get dh to come around and support you<br/>\nfully is to get him information.  Ask some of the people on this site for<br/>\nsome resources!!<br/>\nOn Mon, 21 May 2001 18:05:14 -0000, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  In continuation from my 1st Grade - part II posts earlier last week, <br/>\n&gt;  I thought I would let you know that my dh is finally starting to let <br/>\n&gt;  some of my &quot;unschooling&quot; information sink into his stubborn head.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Over the weekend; He had made a comment to me about how our oldest dd <br/>\n&gt;  (6) will be starting ps for 1st grade in Sept and that she will no <br/>\n&gt;  longer be in the same daycare as our youngest dd (3).
