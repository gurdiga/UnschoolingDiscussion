How could you arrange it?  Husbands can take the <br/>\nkids off sometimes.  Neighbors could have them for a visit.  Relatives to <br/>\nlend a hand?  Just enough so you and the baby are alone and can just sit and <br/>\nbreath.  Wouldn&#39;t that be nice.  Just to sit quietly!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if some things don&#39;t get done that&#39;s OK too.  Dust won&#39;t kill you!
