He will even <br/>\nstart saying &quot;little baby needs his mama&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so happy to read this - I had forgotten this about Jayn. Exhaustion and<br/>\ngrumpiness really are contagious, aren&#39;t they? Just as much as joy and<br/>\ncalmness.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the past few nights I have been very tired and crabby. Early in the<br/>\nweek Jayn suddenly switched to her up-all-night mode, instead of slowly<br/>\nmoving to it over a period of weeks. I was playing catch-up and felt<br/>\ndesperate for sleep. Two nights ago she seemed to be crazier and wilder the<br/>\ncloser to morning it got (the tireder I got), including kicking me in the<br/>\nhead and laughing about it when I sat down near her. <br/>\n<br/>\nI find it very hard to stop her from hitting and kicking out. Sometimes I am<br/>\nliterally just batting her hands away from my face, or desperately holding<br/>\nher arms down, while keeping her body far enough away that she can&#39;t bite<br/>\nme. I am reluctant to hold her until she is calm, after reading Jan Hunt&#39;s<br/>\narticle &quot;The Dangers of Holding Therapy&quot; ( www.naturalchild.org ) although<br/>\nit is tough to know what to do instead. I do tell her to take deep breaths<br/>\nand that helps her. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is clear to me that the best solution generally is to avoid things<br/>\nescalating to the point where she is acting crazy. In the daytime if there<br/>\nis restlessness we can run outside to the pool, go to the park, or just run<br/>\nabout the neighborhood. At four in the morning these options are denied us,<br/>\nif only in consideration of the other apartment dwellers across the<br/>\ncourtyard. Nor can she do too much big jumping and running in our second<br/>\nfloor apartment. Also my brain is not usually mush when I am less tired.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing I did differently the following night was make sure she had<br/>\nmore food more regularly. My internal appetite/clock is so out of whack that<br/>\nI just am not feeling hungry, so I had been waiting for her to let me know<br/>\nthat she was hungry. It made a lot of difference to just put out a bowl of<br/>\ncut fruit and some eggs and bacon at appropriate (relative to hours awake<br/>\nrather than the clock) times.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second thing was rather than squabble over the television (we were<br/>\narguing over who was going to watch the big tv for goodness sake) I decided<br/>\nto use her little tv/dvd combo to catch up on some dvd&#39;s that I have wanted<br/>\nto see, using the headphones for quiet. To my pleased amazement, Jayn has<br/>\nspent the last two nights letting me do quite a lot of this quiet watching,<br/>\nwhich is easy to pause when she needs something, while playing nearby. She<br/>\ngets to watch her stuff, or have the big set off. We have also done more<br/>\nreading, and she has been playing with her musical instruments. The main<br/>\nplus is that I don&#39;t have to listen to yet another rerun of &quot;Max and Ruby&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third thing has been that she has spent some time in the evening (her<br/>\nmorning) playing with dh, a crucial break for both of us. He had been out of<br/>\nthe house for the first couple of &quot;angry&quot; nights, by coincidence, and pretty<br/>\nmuch going directly to bed when he got home. Not having to be her sole<br/>\nsource of interaction has made me feel less pressured.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe slow march back to daytime continues. Today she went to sleep a little<br/>\nearlier than I would have liked at about 9.10am. Unless this is just a nap,<br/>\nshe will awaken at about 6.30 - 7pm. I&#39;m about to go to bed now. I&#39;m going<br/>\nto keep the idea of her as a mirror in the forefront of my mind. <br/>\n<br/>\nGreat post, Pat. I&#39;ve saved it in my Unschooling Keepers folder.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

My son is a <br/>\nbarometer of me. When I am tense, worried, aggitated, hungary, tired, <br/>\netc. he keys up a notch and starts clinging, whining, or seeking to <br/>\ndistract me from whatever he perceives to be bothering mama. He is so <br/>\nperceptive of my emotions, more so than I am even, that he is a <br/>\nlittle mirror for me to learn about myself. He is so acutely in tune <br/>\nwith me that it is very unsettling for him when I am unsettled, even <br/>\na little bit. I am amazed at his ability to read me. He is <br/>\nNOT &quot;acting out&quot;; he is calling out for the calm mama. He will even <br/>\nstart saying &quot;little baby needs his mama&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I realized that my peace is powerful to our calmness as a family. <br/>\nI know that his reactions are a cue to recenter myself. As he has <br/>\ngrown older, he uses his words more to show me myself. When he was <br/>\nyounger, he used his actions too: hitting, grabbing, even biting a <br/>\nfew times. I have learned that these are his calls for help to <br/>\nresettle our home. He wants a happy home as much as I do. But I do <br/>\nhave much more ability to break the cycle of harmony and disharmony <br/>\nas the adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I will stop, kneel down to his level, hold or hug him and <br/>\nwhisper. Then he knows I am calmer, he is able to rely on me to help <br/>\nhim and he can move on. It is very disturbing to have the mama out of <br/>\ncontrol.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am learning not to be a type A, it doesn&#39;t work well for us as a <br/>\nfamily. Mama needs to be peace for the family to be peaceful.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; I hear this voice in my head, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?
