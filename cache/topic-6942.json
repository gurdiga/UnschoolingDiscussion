Ditto there. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn retrospect , I think that being worried when you are starting something<br/>\nnew is pretty healthy. After all, worry comes from caring and wanting to do<br/>\nthe right thing. In the case of our children, I think worry comes part and<br/>\nparcel with the job of parenting. We want to make sure that we are not<br/>\n&#39;missing&#39; a piece of the learning pie. We don&#39;t want to mess up so we worry. <br/>\n<br/>\nTime will help. Reading a lot about home education will help (there were<br/>\nfew histories written about homelearning familes when I started but there<br/>\nis a proliferation now!). But the most important thing is to have your own<br/>\nperson mantra to remind yourself to accept how you feel as normal. Any new<br/>\njob, any new relationship of merit  will cause you to worry and think...&quot;am<br/>\nI doing the right thing? am I doing too much? am I doing too little? what<br/>\nif it doesn&#39;t work out?&quot; Things are no different with homelearning, but<br/>\npersonally, after what I have seen in our family, it is only a win-win<br/>\nsituation. There are ups-and-downs-and-in-betweens in the beginning just<br/>\nlike any new job . But things settle down over the years and the<br/>\nbeing/learning together becomes second nature.  The secret is to let go and<br/>\naccept your &#39;stage&#39; of your &#39;new job&#39;. Remember that &quot;this too will pass&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have done a thorough job of convincing your family that this is the<br/>\nright thing I would assume that you know the pros of homelearning. I think<br/>\nthat you need to listen to the messages that you gave them. I kept a<br/>\njournal at the beginning and write down all the incredible learning moments<br/>\n, especially those where I was a spectator or facilitator. I would reread<br/>\nthese and they  would buoy me up on the days where the self-doubt would nag<br/>\nthe loudest. But time was the ultimate salve for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy does your daughter want to go back to school? Maybe she is worried<br/>\ntoo!!! This may be a place for you to sit down and have a private talk to<br/>\nfind out what her worries are...some of them may be the same as yours. <br/>\nYou could use this as an opportunity to share your fears and move beyond<br/>\nthem. <br/>\n<br/>\nTell us how things are going and send more specific questions. We will try<br/>\nto help you through this period. <br/>\nI would say that most of us have been there...you are not alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBig hugs from <br/>\nBrooke in BC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:23 AM 3/6/00 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;K WORTHEN&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kworthen@...\">kworthen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Brooke,<br/>\n&gt;            You wrote that in the begining you were worried yourself about<br/>\n&gt;homeschooling.

I can re-enroll my children at<br/>\n&gt; any given time.<br/>\n&gt; 3...if in the worst case scenario they don&#39;t thrive under my tuteledge I<br/>\n&gt; can ask for help from others with more expertise (either someone in the<br/>\n&gt; flesh or online help/tutouring)<br/>\n&gt; 4...my kids will always be able to work at their own pace and their own<br/>\n&gt; daily timetable (they might do math better at 8pm instead of 9 am).<br/>\n&gt; 5...if their own genuine learning speed is too slow for society<br/>\n&gt; (grandparents etc) then it would also be too slow for the PS system and<br/>\n&gt; therefore my kid needs the one on one of HSing.<br/>\n&gt; 6...if my kid is learning at lightspeed the PS wouldn&#39;t be able to<br/>\n&gt; accomodate them and they would be better off with one on one HSing.<br/>\n&gt; 7..my kids can do a GED and take courses to meet entry requirements as<br/>\n&gt; mature students when they reach 19 yrs...some colleges reserve placement<br/>\n&gt; spots specificly for mature students....which means they may have an<br/>\n&gt; advatage in getting a placement, and who says they have to enter college<br/>\n&gt; at 18 anyways?<br/>\n&gt; 8....philisophical/topical discussions are based on how long the child<br/>\n&gt; wants to discuss them not on when the bell rings and stops it because<br/>\n&gt; you have to go to the next class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ohhhh somebody stop me I could go on and on and on!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Buzz<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt;  The Klement Family       &quot;Education is what survives when<br/>\n&gt;  Darryl, Debbie,           what has been learned has been<br/>\n&gt;  Kathleen, Nathan &        forgotten&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  Samantha                  B.F.

We had many &#39;discussions&#39; and it took time for them to<br/>\ntotally accept our choice. But I kept reminding them that the bottom line<br/>\nfor us was that the girls were loved and nurtured in a stimulating and<br/>\nencouraging way. We love learning, we love books and we love our children!<br/>\nA perfect mix...and the proof is in the pudding as they have grown into<br/>\nself-motivated learners (they are 11 and 9). <br/>\n<br/>\nMom still phones once in a while and says, &quot;Do the girls keep a journal?<br/>\nDid the girls do math today? &quot; but ...these types of questions are becoming<br/>\nfewer and fewer as time goes on and they see how balanced we are in our<br/>\napproach.  I always laugh when my mom phones and says these things (and<br/>\nremind her that she needs to come and visit soon!!!). I actually love some<br/>\nof the heated philosophical discussions that I have with my parents and<br/>\nsibling. These discussions help us all understand each other. And , if I<br/>\nremain open and accepting of the discussion I can really learn a lot and be<br/>\na more critical thinker about where our learing is going. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that a lot of their questions come from a place of love. They ask<br/>\nthe questions because they love the girls and their own experience was<br/>\nschool. And it worked for them. They were  very interesting, loving<br/>\nteachers and I know that they were  well-loved by their students. However,<br/>\nit is only natural that they question our choice...it is a foreign world to<br/>\nthem and they want answers. The answers take time to show themselves. But<br/>\nit is happening...the girls are so solid, so empathetic, so spirited. <br/>\nMy mom and dad are now hard-core believers in home education.

Sometimes, I might not really cope, but sort of<br/>\nmuddle through??  I know that I mothered intensely for a number of years. I<br/>\nhave a child that was molested that needed lots and lots of me.  Then I had<br/>\n3 children in 4 years and I had all I could do to keep them clean and fed.<br/>\nNow I have healthy, happy kids, all of whom are busy living and learning and<br/>\nflowing around me.  But after all the diapers were done and everyone could<br/>\nget food for themselves life changed. I had a bit more time just for myself<br/>\nand I laid claim to it with passion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad and stepmom and mil have all voiced disapproval and dismay. They<br/>\ndon&#39;t understand a great many of our choices. I spent time trying to help<br/>\nthem see from our perspective, but they really were not interested in<br/>\nunderstanding, only in controlling.  Sadly, we&#39;ve had to limit our time and<br/>\nefforts with them.  Life is too short to deal with the same issue over and<br/>\nover.<br/>\n<br/>\nLoneliness has cropped up for me. My circle of friends has been small, but I<br/>\nmust say this year has brought many interesting people into my life.  And<br/>\nthat&#39;s where I focus. I work at making these new friendships.  I refused to<br/>\nget sucked into spending my time with people who drain me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think another thing I do is just talk honestly that it&#39;s hard to always be<br/>\nodd man out and I would like to be accepted for just being me.  Many times<br/>\nthose naysayers hear the underlying plea to let matters of difference lie.<br/>\nWe focus on just being ourselves together, rather than all of us being<br/>\nalike.  It gives them room to acknowledge the places they are indeed<br/>\ndifferent too. It&#39;s hard work though.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to cleaning out my mailbox. &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLisaKK</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6978,"nextTopicId":7070}}
