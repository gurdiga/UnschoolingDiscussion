In the more traditional sense of the<br/>\nterm as referring to fantasy gaming, it refers to Dungeons and Dragons,<br/>\nAdvanced Dungeons and Dragons, GUURPS (based on Middle Earth from Tolkien,<br/>\nGamma World (a post apocolyptic one where you can be a sentient plant or<br/>\nanimal or a mutation that is some combination or variation, etc) and a<br/>\nhundred others with a hundred other themes.  There are vampire ones,<br/>\nhistorical ones from various time periods, science fiction ones, and on and<br/>\non.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;games&quot; ususally comprise of a &quot;module&quot; or storyline (complete with<br/>\ndialogue of the folks the players run into, maps and a quest object or some<br/>\nother reason to get the action going.)  Using various types of dice when<br/>\nthings must be determined randomly or semi randomly (everything from<br/>\ndetermining a character&#39;s physical attributes to whether or not they slip<br/>\non a algae covered rock) and a Game Master who leads the action (sometimes<br/>\noverruling the dice) and is privy to all the maps and info in the module<br/>\nand acts as an impartial (we hope) referee/coach/storyteller/etc a group of<br/>\npeople have an adventure!
