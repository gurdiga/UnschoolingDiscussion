Shortly following my last post I packed up <br/>\nand headed out for the weekend. As I drove, I kept wondering why I was so <br/>\ninvested in arguing the rights of others and their belief systems. Perhaps it is <br/>\nthe human part of me that pleads for justice, perhaps it is my inability to <br/>\nremain narrow minded about things to which I don&#39;t understand, disagree with or <br/>\nplain and simply don&#39;t like. Lots to dwell on, especially during a weekend I <br/>\nhad been looking forward to as my DH and the twins were doing their <br/>\ndaddy/daughters weekend and I was actually alone for 2 solid days. I had planned on using <br/>\nthis time alone to reflect on things going on in my own life and to really <br/>\npamper myself. Instead I spent it assisting my sister with a school project I <br/>\nwholehearted disagree with. It was like I couldn&#39;t get away from the topics of <br/>\nbelief systems and how I fit in the scheme of things. Having not slept since <br/>\nThrusday night, I figured even while working on this irritating project, that <br/>\nsurely the sleep I was in such desparate need of, would come with ease. WRONG! <br/>\nAs I tossed and turned Saturday night, wishing my brain would shut down and <br/>\ntrying to find some semblance of personal peace, I reluctantly began channel <br/>\nsurfing on the TV. Nothing on but infomercials, I was pleased to find &quot;Back to the <br/>\nFuture&quot; in my moms VCR, a movie I loved so much when I was 14, I went <br/>\nrepeatedly to the afternoon matinee to watch. Back then, matinees were $2.50. Don&#39;t I <br/>\nwish matinee&#39;s were still so cheap, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I lay there watching, the wheels in my brain still turning, I had a <br/>\nlightbulb moment. A way in which I could make an analogy from a movie I loved. In <br/>\nthe movie, Marty McFly lives a life filled with bullies, an acoholic mother, an <br/>\nuncle ready to be let out of prison, a father who operates from fear and <br/>\nsiblings who seemingly have no ambition. He has 2 people in his life that he finds <br/>\nsolice with, his girlfriend and the wacky scientist. As events unfold and <br/>\nMarty is transported back to the time his parents met, it hit me like the Delorean <br/>\n(sp?) he was driving! Here is what I mean:<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the time of his parents youth, utilizing his free will, Marty <br/>\nbegins to change the outcome of events that determined his life as he knew it <br/>\nbefore he left 1984. Yet all the events still took place. It was through his use <br/>\nof free-will that the outcomes changed. His parents still went to the dance and <br/>\nfell in love, his father still had to confront his own school bully, and upon <br/>\nreturning to 1984, we find that his family still resides in the same house, <br/>\nhis brother and sister are still the same human forms, but all are in better <br/>\ncircumstances. Importantly to Marty, his girlfriend still loves him and the <br/>\nwacky scientist isn&#39;t dead. This is where the belief in predestination and free <br/>\nwill being interconnected can be found. The predestined events still took place, <br/>\nwhile the usage of freewill changed the outcome of the events. Perhaps this <br/>\nanalogy is far too simple, but having still not slept yet, I may be writing on <br/>\nauto-pilot, LOL. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for me it is entirely possible to operate with both tenets in place. That <br/>\nnot each and everything is necessarily predestined and not everything is <br/>\nfree-will related, rather a combination of both. Oddly enough, some other events <br/>\ntook place and it seemed everywhere I turned someone was saying one of the <br/>\nfollowing:<br/>\n<br/>\n       It was meant to be. <br/>\n       It was inevitable.<br/>\n       Dejavu.<br/>\n       It was in God&#39;s plan.<br/>\n       It was unavoidable.<br/>\n       I couldn&#39;t help it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I&#39;m sure there may be many other phrases that would say the same thing, <br/>\nthose were the ones I heard directly over the last 2 days. For me, it hit <br/>\nhome that all of those phrases are be about predestiny, that each person that <br/>\nsaid it, for whatever reason that they believed what they were saying, at those <br/>\nmoments in time, each encompasses the theory that somehow, someway whatever <br/>\nhappened, happened because it was meant to. Whether one uses those statements to <br/>\ncomfort themselves, protect themselves or to escape responsibility, makes no <br/>\ndifference. The statements alone prescribe that they believe the events were <br/>\ndestined to be what they were. For me, it&#39;s what I do following those events <br/>\nthat determines my existance until the next event.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my tired thoughts,<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81273,"nextTopicId":51593}}
