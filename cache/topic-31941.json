Do any of you know of published sources that deal with homeschooling, ideally unschooling, in places other than the US? I know they exist, but my university library either doesn&#39;t carry or index the sources or I am not using good search terms. Any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated! I am trying to prepare a paper that looks at homeschooling comparatively.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;d prefer to reply to me off list, my address is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdeets@...\">jdeets@...</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31923,"nextTopicId":31930}}
