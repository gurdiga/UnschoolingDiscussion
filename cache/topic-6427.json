We just bought more software for the boys tonight.  <br/>\nWe allow them to play with their software anytime we&#39;re not on and we&#39;re <br/>\navailable to supervise.  Than, our four year old, is getting to the point <br/>\nwhere he can play some of his games by himself.  Almost all the software we <br/>\nhave is educational, but I&#39;ll have to say the only games that I really would <br/>\nobject to would be killing games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think having a computer is an advantage when HS/US, as it&#39;s easier on me to <br/>\n&quot;teach&quot; certain things.  Than is very independent and learns things easier on <br/>\nhis own.  The computer provides a wide range of knowledge, right at our <br/>\nfinger tips.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to the zoo on Ground Hog&#39;s Day.  Our local zoo has free admission in <br/>\nFeb. but I didn&#39;t know this, so we took the money that we would have spent on <br/>\nadmission and went to the gift shop.  The boys picked out some toy dolphins <br/>\nand elephants.  While playing with them at home, they asked me what sounds <br/>\nthey made.  We looked at our video collection first, but alas no videos had <br/>\ndolphins or elephants on them, so we decided we would have to wait to go to <br/>\nthe library.  But then I remembered the internet!!  So we looked up dolphin <br/>\nand elephant sounds and lo and behold we found some sound waves.  The boys <br/>\nwere thrilled with them!  When we went to the library, they remembered that <br/>\nwe wanted to get books and videos on elephants and dolphins.  So we had <br/>\nseveral learning moments!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso wanted to add about support groups.  I felt very weird about joining an <br/>\nunschooling with all my kids under the &quot;norm&quot; schooling age.  But I felt I <br/>\nneeded the support and also I wanted to feel the waters while I could still <br/>\ngracefully back out if I changed my mind.  I also wanted to give my husband <br/>\ntwo years to get used to the idea of not only hsing but unsing!  Than turns <br/>\nfive after the 1st of Sep. which is the deadline here.  So this gives gives <br/>\nus time to try out the water without a lot of comments from friends and <br/>\nfamily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have one cat who is spitting up food.  It&#39;s not vomit (sorry to be <br/>\nexplicit) it&#39;s barely digested food.  We feed them quality dry food free <br/>\nchoice and free access to fresh water.

But then I switched to Purina Deli Cat to see if he&#39;d like that <br/>\nbetter, well he went a whole week and then this morning he first spit up and <br/>\nthen actually vomited twice with in a half hour.
