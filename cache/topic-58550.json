I know by posting such <br/>\npersonal and sensitive issues on a public board, I am setting myself up for <br/>\nscrutiny, perhaps even condescension and misunderstanding. .. But, Im willing <br/>\nto take the chance ( and the heat, if I have to)  because ultimately, I know <br/>\nI am not the only parent out here with these kinds of situations and issues <br/>\nand I really think that it&#39;s helpful for folks to talk about thier real life <br/>\nchallanges and to see that they are NOT alone in facing them.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI know there is no way to discuss EVERY aspect of challanges and  concerns <br/>\nthat I have for my sons within the context of one post.  And, it wouldnt be <br/>\npossible for anyone to sufficiently give feedback, advice, suggestions, etc. <br/>\non several topics at once.  So, I am going to pick one thing that is really <br/>\ncausing a lot of stress, upset, and emotional turmoil in our home right now.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  My 11 yo is ADHD, and he probably has several other &quot; disablities&quot; that <br/>\nhave never been diagnosed officially.  I know he has a lot of traits of <br/>\ncentral processing deficits.  He can be very aggressive.. emotionally <br/>\ndistraught, mood swings, depressed, introverted, low self esteem.   My 7 yo <br/>\nis VERY similar in behavior. ALTHOUGH, I  think a lot of his behavior is <br/>\nlearned from his brother.. I know he has a low frustration level, just like <br/>\nEthan,   but, he seems to be more able to control his outbursts.. Heck, I <br/>\ndont know.. sometimes it seems like he cant..  OK.. heres what we are facing <br/>\nnow<br/>\n<br/>\nVideo games.   Yes, both of my sons ( 7 and 11) love them.   Actually, they <br/>\nused to play computer games.. we didnt have video game systems til Christmas. <br/>\n We had many many conflicts over computer games because of having to share <br/>\nthe computer with 6 people.. And our computer is not &quot;gaming effecient&quot;  lots <br/>\nof technical difficulties which led to frustration and upset.   I hoped that <br/>\nthe new Xbox and Nintendo 64 would alleviate some of this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, Ethan threw the controller on the Xbox within a week of getting it.. I <br/>\nbought a new one ( to the suggestion of list members).. He threw it and broke <br/>\nit in less than 2 weeks..  We had to wait another 2 weeks to get one .. ( <br/>\nmoney and time issues).. So, I bought a new one. He broke it the next day.   <br/>\nOK.. in the mean time.. I had also bought ANOTHER N64 to help with the <br/>\n&quot;sharing&quot; problem.   There were a total of 5 controllers for N64.. Now, we&#39;re <br/>\ndown to 1.. Either Ethan or JP broke all of them.   They love the action of <br/>\nplaying the games.. BUT, neither of them can take the frustration of losing <br/>\nor not &quot;getting&quot; what they want in the game.  They scream, cry, cuss, throw <br/>\nthings.   Hit each other, basically throw INTENSE temper tantrums.  I have <br/>\ntried to play the games with them.. talk to them, Ive looked up tons of <br/>\n&quot;cheats and tricks&quot; for every game they have..  ( also, they tend to get <br/>\nfrustrated with games and I have to continually buy new ( used) ones)..   <br/>\nThier days are rounds of playing, screaming, crying, tantrums. more playing.. <br/>\nThey are NOT interested in anything else.. I have to MAKE.. yes.. MAKE, <br/>\nphysically pick up or manuever them to go out  with me.  Its not a good idea <br/>\nto leave a 7 and 11 yo at home alone and its not fair for the Anna and I to <br/>\nstay home all the time.. I try to do most of my &quot;outside&quot; stuff when my <br/>\noldest son gets home or my husband so they boys can stay.. But, I cant do it <br/>\nALL after 3:00.. Anna wants to go to band, the library, other homeschool <br/>\nactivites.  Its a BIG TIME &quot;struggle&quot; ( and thats a mild word)  to get them <br/>\nto stop playing video games for anything..   You know, if they were happily <br/>\nplaying,  loving every minute of it.. at least I could understand why they <br/>\ndont want to stop to go somewhere ( thats the only time I make them stop.. <br/>\nnot to eat, sleep or &quot;anything&quot; else)   But they are NOT happy at least half <br/>\nthe time they are playing.. They are mad, angry, flailing about throwing <br/>\ntantrums, breaking stuff, fighting each other.  WHAT THE HELL IS FUN ABOUT <br/>\nTHAT??? Or.. what is being &quot;learned&quot;??  Its nothing but a terriblly <br/>\nexhaustive stress on me and them and thier sibs.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI &quot;offer&quot; lots of other things to do.  We have TONS of books, arts, crafts, <br/>\nmusical instruments, videos, blocks, toys.. Heck,you name it.. Nope.. they <br/>\nwant to play ( ie fight over.. games). I make suggestions.. &quot;hey its so nice <br/>\noutside, lets go ride our bikes ...  Gosh, lets go see Grandpa and ride the <br/>\n4-wheeler.. Do you guys want to go to the park?&quot;  I just do stuff and hope <br/>\nthey will become interested.( read, paint, cook, whatever). Nope.. BUT, per <br/>\nunschooling advice. I let them decide if they want to do these things or <br/>\nnot.. ANd the response is NOT.   <br/>\n<br/>\nToday, I just had it.. JP was playing a new game i got him yesterday.. Lego <br/>\nracers.. I thought it may be easier than some he tries to play. Maybe he <br/>\nwould be successful at it.. Well, hell, something wasnt working right.. He <br/>\ngot mad.. he yelled at me.. I came in.. and asked what was wrong.. He <br/>\nscreamed. &quot;IM NOT TELLING YOU&quot;  Ok.. well, how can I help if I dont know what <br/>\nis wrong.. ?!?!?!   He throws his fit for a while..  I finally get him calmed <br/>\ndown.. Then he is playing again and Ethan comes in and sits down to watch. <br/>\n.This infuriates JP and he screams that Ethan is messing him up and he throws <br/>\na remote at Ethan.. Ethan goes beserk, throws a chair, clears the <br/>\n(clutttered) dining room table.. basically a meltdown.. Its total psycho <br/>\nchaos trying to control them from hurting themselves or each other.. I yanked <br/>\nthe cords out of the N64 and put it up.  Period.. I couldnt deal with it any <br/>\nmore.  Ethan went outside to play.  JP screamed and yelled at me for 20 more <br/>\nminutes or so.. I tried to calm him down too.. Soothe him.. explain to him <br/>\nthat the N64 is &quot;not fun&quot; if its causing this kind of conflict.   He went <br/>\noutside with Ethan.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThis kind of stuff has been going on since Christmas. ..If they just &#39;sat <br/>\nlike zombies&quot; in front of the games.. I wouldnt be so upset. . But, its like <br/>\nthe games are just fuel for their frustrations and the enjoyment they get out <br/>\nof them is minute compared to the &quot;bad stuff&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nOK. . now what?<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58549,"nextTopicId":58514}}
