Take him out.<br/>\n<br/>\n          You know, this seems to be the general consensus.  When we first started at the church, he was three years old, and they seemed to think he was really hyper because he loved to run so much.  I was advised by the nursery teacher (another teacher-by-profession) to look into Ritalin.  This was in no way part of my plans, but I did allow myself to be persuaded to keep him in the infant section another year as A) his birthday was in January, so he was younger than the rest and B) he probably wouldn&#39;t be happy in the children&#39;s section where he was required to sit quietly on a chair for singing time and lesson time.  Pretty trippy that this is the kid the teacher is now worried about as he is so in to singing and lesson time!  I am looking in to getting him up at least one class level, where he would be with his &quot;grade mates&quot;.  Unfortunately, this is an all boy class of particularly sassy, incorrigible kids who pride themselves on not being able to keep a teacher.  Not sure which is the lesser of two evils!
