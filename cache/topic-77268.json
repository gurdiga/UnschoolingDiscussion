I knew a couple of kids growing up that professionally <br/>\n&gt; modeled and were in commercials.  None of them went to a modeling school but <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; instead took ballet or some sort of dance class to help with poise, grace, <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; posture.  A couple also took acting classes and were in drama at school.  <br/>\n&gt; They <br/>\n&gt; were told often as kids how photogenic they were and that they should model, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; so their parents spent a hefty amount of money getting pictures done by a <br/>\n&gt; photographer that KNOWS what he&#39;s doing (you&#39;d need to find one that knows <br/>\n&gt; how to <br/>\n&gt; put a portfolio together and has done it for a while) and they sent one or 2 <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; pages of photos to real agencies and just waited. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cameron was told this OFTEN as well.

They said to get a great <br/>\nphotographer---put your several hundred dollars into HIS work---and then just send the <br/>\nportfolio to every ad agency in the state. The ad agencies prefer to work <br/>\nwith individuals because they are (generally) less pushy than the modelling <br/>\nagencies/schools AND because the agencies/schools charge more (they need their <br/>\npercentage too). Plus, that they LIKE homeschoolers because most shoots don&#39;t <br/>\nhappen after three or on weekends! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14564,"nextTopicId":77290}}
