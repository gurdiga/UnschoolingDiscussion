In the &quot;schoolroom&quot; I have a total<br/>\n&gt; of 8 stackable storage shelves along one whole wall<br/>\n&gt; that were meant to store shoes on in a closet but I<br/>\n&gt; have toys on them in plastic tubs. Toys such as gears,<br/>\n&gt; playdoh, playdoh pieces, jigsaw puzzles, pegboard,<br/>\n&gt; lacing cards, duplos, mega blocks, etc. I have a play<br/>\n&gt; kitchen and tons of play food with Dora talking house<br/>\n&gt; along another wall, non-fiction books on different<br/>\n&gt; things such as bugs, cultures, occupations, animals,<br/>\n&gt; etc on a stackable shelf with workbooks underneath,<br/>\n&gt; craft things on another wall. It feels too schoolish I<br/>\n&gt; think for Chloe. She doesn&#39;t go in there too much.<br/>\n&gt; What can I do differently?

I mean, bins and throw it in type clean up so that it is <br/>\neasy for anyone.  This way it is everyone&#39;s space, so no one person <br/>\nfeels like they have responsibility to do all the cleanup.  Everyone <br/>\ncan help and everyone can use it and mess it up again.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur house is really small so the whole house is one big toy bin.  <br/>\nMessy all the time!  However, sometimes I do need to vaccuum, so I <br/>\nask for help to pick up the floor because I feel they should have a <br/>\nsay in where things get put away.  Generally they are willing to <br/>\nhelp, sometimes they are not and I do it myself.  It is easier to do <br/>\nit myself than try to get someone to help if they are unwilling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my youngest goes into my oldest dd&#39;s clean room and messes it up, <br/>\nI will generally clean it up better than how it was to begin with.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s only fair really as they have little control over the set up of <br/>\nour living space.  When we lived in a big house it really wasn&#39;t <br/>\nthat big of a deal for anyone because it was easier to live in the <br/>\nspace that was messy, yet still have the ability to walk through the <br/>\nspaces without stepping on things.  It was also easier to keep toy <br/>\nareas seperate from spaces that one could relax in without clutter.  <br/>\nProjects could be left out and be untouched for a few days without <br/>\nhaving the need of the space.  It just isn&#39;t so where we live now, <br/>\nso we all help a little to keep everyone happy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now my oldest dd has set up a huge painting project that is <br/>\ntaking up the entire living room space.  She has set it up in a way <br/>\nwhere spills are addressed and her little sister can paint without <br/>\ndamaging the carpet.  It&#39;s really cool that she was so nice to do <br/>\nthat even though she really just wanted to paint something for <br/>\nherself.  She knew her sister wouldn&#39;t stay out of her way so she <br/>\nmade it possible for her to paint as well.  It is win/win for <br/>\neveryone.  I like to encourage this type of interaction between my <br/>\nkids, so the best thing I can do to help is offer to do all the <br/>\ncleanup when they are done.  My oldest will probably clean her own <br/>\nstuff and I will probably clean up my youngest and her mess.  This <br/>\nway my oldest can finish whenever she wants to and she doesn&#39;t have <br/>\nto worry about helping her sister finish up.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":198283962,"authorName":"kazitetalibuse","from":"&quot;kazitetalibuse&quot; &lt;acudoc@...&gt;","profile":"kazitetalibuse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Brand spankin new to unschooling - I think!","postDate":"1141653070","msgId":112571,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR1aGVvZStlaWNmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDkwOEJGMjdGLTNEQTUtNEFCMi05QzVDLTA5M0NFQTQyNTk2OEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":112567,"nextInTopic":112574,"prevInTime":112570,"nextInTime":112572,"topicId":112545,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Which makes me think that there might be something to that study<br/>\non success that I keep hearing about. If taking pride in ones work,<br/>\nfeeling a sense of accomplishment, competence, participation through<br/>\nbeing part of the house cleaning team leads to a success in adult life<br/>\n(as the study I mention below suggests), may be involving them in<br/>\nchores is a beneficial thing after all? I don&#39;t know...<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is an article about the study:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://education.umn.edu/research/ResearchWorks/Rossmann.html\">http://education.umn.edu/research/ResearchWorks/Rossmann.html</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n&quot;Using measures of individual&#39;s success such as completion of<br/>\neducation, getting started on a career path, IQ, relationships with<br/>\nfamily and friends, and not using drugs, and examining a child&#39;s<br/>\ninvolvement in household tasks at all three earlier time, Rossmann<br/>\ndetermined that the best predictor of young adults&#39; success in their<br/>\nmid-20s was that they participated in household tasks when they were<br/>\nthree or four. However, if they did not begin participating until they<br/>\nwere 15 or 16, the participation backfired and those subjects were<br/>\nless &quot;successful.&quot; The assumption is that responsibility learned via<br/>\nhousehold tasks is best when learned young.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow the tasks are presented also influences children&#39;s abilities to<br/>\nbecome well-adjusted adults. The tasks should not be too overwhelming,<br/>\nparents should present the tasks in a way that fits the child&#39;s<br/>\npreferred learning style, and children should be involved in<br/>\ndetermining the tasks they will complete, through family meeting and<br/>\nmethods such a weekly chore chart. They should not be made to do the<br/>\ntasks for an allowance. The earlier parents begin getting children to<br/>\ntake an active role in the household, the easier it will be to get<br/>\nthem involved as teens.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I am concerned with is<br/>\n&gt; that my 2 1/2 year old gets into her sisters things<br/>\n&gt; and leaves them all over when Chloe has picked up her<br/>\n&gt; room (at my asking) and she gets frustrated over this.<br/>\n&gt; Do I put them in separate rooms? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My girls are 5 years apart. They shared a room until the younger one<br/>\nwas 2 1/2. The spare bedroom was the older girl&#39;s playroom where she<br/>\nhas her art table and all her supplies. We put a plastic cover on the<br/>\ndoorknob to prevent the younger one from going in there alone. When it<br/>\nstarted to be a problem for her, we made a big deal of setting up<br/>\ntheir bedroom as her own special room with her own toys, bed, and<br/>\nthings. The older one moved into her playroom. We took the plastic<br/>\ncover off the doorknob and try to help them both to respect each<br/>\nother&#39;s space, room, things. They do pretty well with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also- how do you handle snacks when they haven&#39;t eaten<br/>\n&gt; very good at lunch, dinner, etc? Chloe will say she is<br/>\n&gt; full but then want an immediate snack. What is<br/>\n&gt; considered a snack? Cookies, candy, fruit, yogurt? How<br/>\n&gt; many snacks a day? Whenever they want? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I struggle with food, too. We (parents) choose not to buy stuff with<br/>\nsugar and I worry that the kids will see it as limits that are too<br/>\ncontrolling. On the other hand, I literally suffer (and as a result of<br/>\nmy pain, my family suffers from my neglect) when I eat sugar and if it<br/>\nis around me or anywhere in the house, it&#39;s truly too hard for me not<br/>\nto eat it. It&#39;s pretty much as if someone was trying to stop smoking<br/>\nand others smoked in front of him/her or smoked in the house (or with<br/>\ntrying to stop drinking alcohol). My younger girl loves to eat even<br/>\nwhen she is not hungry and would eat all the time - same as you<br/>\ndescribe with Chloe. I have noticed that often she is just asking for<br/>\nattention, not food. An offer of play, reading book etc. easily puts<br/>\nher attention on something else than food. Not that I criticise her<br/>\nwish to eat, if she asks again, she gets what she wants (cold cuts,<br/>\nfrozen blueberries, fruit, left-overs, cheese -whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRenata</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94612024,"authorName":"Kimberly","from":"Kimberly &lt;barehug4u2@...&gt;","profile":"kjimberly","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] &quot;trying&quot; vs. doing","postDate":"1141585515","msgId":112565,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMzA1MTkwNTE1LjcwMzg4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMzMzAxLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDA5Q0Q5MzhELTQyNTAtNEI3OS04MDQ1LUIwQjk2RkMzMDZGREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":112564,"nextInTopic":112566,"prevInTime":112564,"nextInTime":112566,"topicId":112545,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m not asking that what I say be added to anything.

A clean house isn&#39;t among<br/>\nmy top priorities.  If we have guests coming there is usually a fury<br/>\nof cleaning, but that is my need and not Simon and Linnaea&#39;s need. <br/>\nAnd when it is their need they clean.  The other day Linnaea helped<br/>\nclean the house because she wanted to help us get as much money as<br/>\npossible when we sell the house so that we can maximize the size of<br/>\nour next house&#39;s backyard.  Dawn (in NS) wrote a wonderful post at<br/>\nunschooling.info about creating clean spaces for her children to make<br/>\na new mess in:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info/collectedposts/collectedposts1.htm\">http://www.unschooling.info/collectedposts/collectedposts1.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I am concerned with is<br/>\n&gt; that my 2 1/2 year old gets into her sisters things<br/>\n&gt; and leaves them all over when Chloe has picked up her<br/>\n&gt; room (at my asking) and she gets frustrated over this.<br/>\n&gt; Do I put them in separate rooms? Kylie wanted to go in<br/>\n&gt; Chloes room and would have her way in it and I&#39;d end<br/>\n&gt; up picking it up which I got tired of. I was also<br/>\n&gt; tired of closing Chloes door so Kylie wouldn&#39;t go in. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can understand Chloe&#39;s frustration.  She did a job that she didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to do and then along comes her pain in the butt younger sibling<br/>\nand messes it up.  I&#39;m sure my brother felt that toward me more times<br/>\nthan I can remember.  I loved going into his room, it was full of so<br/>\nmany exciting things that might just lead to me having a closer<br/>\nrelationship with him.  He used to leave tapes in his big tape<br/>\nrecorder with a sign on the recorder saying HANDS OFF!! so of course<br/>\nthe first thing I would mess with when I&#39;d snuck in his room.  And<br/>\nthere he would be speaking with a vampire accent telling me how I was<br/>\ngoing to be consumed by evil demons for entering into the sacred<br/>\nchamber of Sam.  I loved it, but I don&#39;t really know how he felt about<br/>\nit.  And now, when we are all grown, our relationship is a study in<br/>\ndisinterest, so I am unlikely to ask him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my two children, Simon and Linnaea sort of share a room.  I mean<br/>\ntheir official room is one that they share, but Linnaea is more likely<br/>\nto sleep in David and my bedroom on a futon on the floor and Simon<br/>\nwill often sleep downstairs on the couch.  Recently Linnaea has been<br/>\nsleeping on the sofa-bed downstairs with Simon on the other couch. <br/>\nSo, there is no real sense of personal space. If their bedroom gets<br/>\ntrashed, as it often does when friends come over, it is my gift to<br/>\nthem that I clean it.  I love cleaning their room, I love the process<br/>\nof setting out their favorite things so that they can find them at<br/>\nsome later moment. I love seeing what they have strewn about and<br/>\nimagining the path that it took to arrive there.  Yesterday we had to<br/>\nshow the house on relatively short notice.  Simon is trying to save up<br/>\nto buy King Kong for the Gamecube and has been asking for ways to earn<br/>\nmoney.  I offered him 3 pounds to clean his room, he wanted 5, but I<br/>\nthought it was only worth 3, so he negotiated for more money if he<br/>\ncleaned a different room as well.  In the end he only got 3 pounds<br/>\nbecause while he was motivated enough to clean the one room he just<br/>\nwasn&#39;t keen enough to keep going.  He did a pretty good job for an 8<br/>\nalmost 9 year old who has never cleaned his room before (actually I<br/>\nthink he has cleaned it before, he and Linnaea both have helped me<br/>\nclean before, and they&#39;ve both independently cleaned the living room<br/>\nas a gift to David and me).  But if Linnaea (who is 5 almost 6) had<br/>\ncome into the room when it was clean and played with her toys and<br/>\ndressed up and left little piles of busyness all over the room, it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have negated what he had done. It wouldn&#39;t have taken away<br/>\nfrom the 3 pounds that he had earned. It wouldn&#39;t have put stress on<br/>\ntheir relationship.  I would have swept through and tidied it back up<br/>\nas best I could in what time I had before the showing. Having that<br/>\npeace in their lives allows them to enjoy each other in ways that I<br/>\ncannot remember enjoying with my brother.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also- how do you handle snacks when they haven&#39;t eaten<br/>\n&gt; very good at lunch, dinner, etc? Chloe will say she is<br/>\n&gt; full but then want an immediate snack. What is<br/>\n&gt; considered a snack? Cookies, candy, fruit, yogurt? How<br/>\n&gt; many snacks a day? Whenever they want? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In our house everything that is eaten is food: a candy bar is food, a<br/>\ncookie is food, a burrito is food, brocolli is food, nori is food. <br/>\nAnd just as I eat whatever and whenever I want so do they.  I put out<br/>\nfood for them most days.  So I&#39;ll fix a tray of celery and carrots or<br/>\nsome fruit or olives or a selection of chips (in Britain they tend to<br/>\nsell most chips (crisps here) in individual serving packets) and bring<br/>\nit to wherever they are (for another description of the kind of thing:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter.html)\">http://www.sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter.html)</a> They eat what<br/>\nthey want and I put away or throw out what they leave.  There are<br/>\nusually some sweets in the house as well as lots of savory treats.  If<br/>\nthey want something specific they ask and if we have the ingredients I<br/>\nwill fix it and if not than it will either be written into the next<br/>\ngrocery list or we will go out and get what is lacking in that moment<br/>\n(or call David at work to pick it up on his way home).  Maybe Chloe is<br/>\nfull of whatever she is eating.  Maybe the idea of another bite of<br/>\nmashed potatoes is more than she can handle, but a nice dish of ice<br/>\ncream with chocolate syrup is what is needed to give her that lovely<br/>\nfull feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128695025,"authorName":"wifetovegman2002","from":"&quot;wifetovegman2002&quot; &lt;wifetovegman2002@...&gt;","profile":"wifetovegman2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Brand spankin new to unschooling - I think!","postDate":"1141565775","msgId":112547,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR1ZXBnZitwNGViQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwMzA1MDcyMjE5LjkzOTY3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMzMzA3Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":112545,"nextInTopic":112548,"prevInTime":112546,"nextInTime":112548,"topicId":112545,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The only issue<br/>\nwith her early birth is that she has extremely mild<br/>\ncerebral palsy on her left side which for her means<br/>\nher calf and hamstring muscles on that side are<br/>\ntighter/looser than they should be. She does also have<br/>\na problem with constipation so she takes Milk of<br/>\nMagnesia every night which works great. It isn&#39;t habit<br/>\nforming to her body like MiraLax is. Thank goodness<br/>\nshe wasn&#39;t on it long enough for that to happen. Chloe<br/>\nis who I am basically asking about for now. I think! <br/>\n<br/>\nI let my girls get up when they wake up. I was using<br/>\nan alarm and having them get up at 8am. Sometimes they<br/>\nwould get up early and sometimes later. Now they seem<br/>\nto get up anywhere between 7:30am and 9am on their<br/>\nown. Chloe doesn&#39;t take a nap but Kylie does for<br/>\nhowever long she sleeps. I have just within the last 3<br/>\nweeks let her get up on her own (open her door and get<br/>\nup). <br/>\n<br/>\nI have read a ton - and I mean a ton of emails<br/>\nregarding unschooling on this group but can&#39;t come<br/>\nacross anything to answer my questions so I&#39;m hoping<br/>\nfor some help as I am trying to deschool my brain. <br/>\n<br/>\nChloe would watch tv a good part of the day if I let<br/>\nher - and I have tried it just recently- and play Xbox<br/>\nand Gameboy and play computer games and not help me<br/>\naround the house at all if I didn&#39;t ask. She is<br/>\ngenuinely a very loving and caring child. How do you<br/>\nhandle cleaning around the house? I have absolutely no<br/>\nproblem letting her and her sister leave their room a<br/>\nmess since it is their room.

So I don&#39;t want my<br/>\nkids feeling the same way. It is their room regardless<br/>\nof who pays the rent here.

Whenever they want? <br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing- we have 3 bedrooms upstairs - one for<br/>\nme and my hubby, one for the girls (there is a<br/>\ntwo-shelf bookcase in there loaded with books, a tub<br/>\nfor Barbies, Barbie clothes, cars, etc, a baby doll<br/>\nbed, a baby doll stroller, a goldfish on top of their<br/>\ndresser) and one I am trying to get away from calling<br/>\nthe &quot;schoolroom&quot;. In the &quot;schoolroom&quot; I have a total<br/>\nof 8 stackable storage shelves along one whole wall<br/>\nthat were meant to store shoes on in a closet but I<br/>\nhave toys on them in plastic tubs. Toys such as gears,<br/>\nplaydoh, playdoh pieces, jigsaw puzzles, pegboard,<br/>\nlacing cards, duplos, mega blocks, etc. I have a play<br/>\nkitchen and tons of play food with Dora talking house<br/>\nalong another wall, non-fiction books on different<br/>\nthings such as bugs, cultures, occupations, animals,<br/>\netc on a stackable shelf with workbooks underneath,<br/>\ncraft things on another wall. It feels too schoolish I<br/>\nthink for Chloe. She doesn&#39;t go in there too much.<br/>\nWhat can I do differently? I don&#39;t want big bookcases<br/>\nall over - or do I? <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for taking the time to read to this point!<br/>\nAny help would be very much appreciated!
