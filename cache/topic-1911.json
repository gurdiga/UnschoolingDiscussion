I think the key in your paragraph above is - with his <br/>\ninput - what does he want to learn?  When he&#39;s learned as much as he <br/>\nwants to on that subject,  will he be free to move on to another?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso,  one topic you&#39;ll come across is deschooling.  Kids who have <br/>\nbeen in ps or homeschooled in a very traditional manner often need <br/>\nsome deschooling time in the switch to unschooling.   It might take <br/>\nquite awhile with a child that&#39;s been in school as long as your son.  <br/>\nThis is unstructured time intended to reawaken his own curiousity and <br/>\ndesire to learn.  Some kids watch lots of tv and play lots of video <br/>\ngames.  Others stare into space or sleep.  Most of them worry their parents <br/>\n(who also have to deschool) who think that they&#39;ll never do anything <br/>\nconstructive again.  Then, one day,  they ask to go to the library or the <br/>\nbookstore,  or they get on the internet and while you stand there <br/>\nwith your mouth hanging open,  they amaze you with their new desire <br/>\nto learn.  They might even amaze you with what information they <br/>\nprocessed while it appeared they were doing nothing.  It&#39;s a time <br/>\nthat requires lots of patience,  but it comes with a big pay-off.<br/>\nIt&#39;s so wonderful to witness that joy of learning return.<br/>\nMy kids were so schooled that I had to continually reassure them and <br/>\nmyself that this would work.  Now,  my 13 year old wouldn&#39;t have it <br/>\nany other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember that everything is educational.  My son still watches tv.  <br/>\nWe have no time restrictions on tv or video games.  What I have seen <br/>\nchange is what he chooses to watch and play.  He doesn&#39;t need<br/>\n&quot;escape &quot; time  so much anymore, so he&#39;s just as likely to pick an <br/>\n&quot;educational&quot; show as he is a sitcom,  or to play an &quot;educational&quot; <br/>\ngame on the computer.   We don&#39;t make these &quot;educational&quot; <br/>\ndistinctions at our house anymore.  Everything is input,  and with <br/>\nthat freedom, my son has become much choosier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&quot;ve rambled long enough - hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane from KS<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1873,"nextTopicId":1877}}
