There was nothing meaty in it at all and <br/>\nit seemed to me that John Nash was the one who was trying to lighten it up a <br/>\nbit and get a word in edgewise.  Like when he mentioned that his wife really <br/>\nprobably was as beautiful as the actress who played her.  I thought it was a <br/>\ngreat example of media going into an interview with an agenda and not really <br/>\ncaring about the people involved.  It was sad, to  me, because with an <br/>\nempathetic interviewer, it could have been so great.  But, then again, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know if the Nashes put restrictions on what could be talked about.  <br/>\nSometimes that happens, too.  It just seemed so inconsequential to me.  I had <br/>\na million questions to ask John Nash and his wife (and their son, too!) But <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t hire me to do the interview!  Aw shucks!  Take care...I&#39;m still <br/>\nnot finished with the book.

This was the most revered at for the times...the<br/>\nlikes of Einstein and other great thinkers had much influence.  The new<br/>\narrivals in the graduate math dept were told that class attendance was<br/>\ncertainly optional and completely unnecessary.  The only real requirement<br/>\nwas to be present at afternoon tea,  where they played and invented games,<br/>\nand discussed whatever....but the major &#39;problems&#39; in mathematics were a<br/>\nnatural main force.
