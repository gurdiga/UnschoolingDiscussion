My <br/>\nparents didn&#39;t know what to do with me because I refused to do anything <br/>\nmore than put my name on the paper in first grade.  They had me tested, <br/>\nI was labeled &quot;gifted&quot; and from that moment forward every decision my <br/>\nparents made revolved around my schooling.  I was shuffled from one <br/>\nschool to another in search of a decent gifted program and because my <br/>\nfamily moved several times.  I was unhappy in every one except one <br/>\nspecial program that was &quot;child led&quot; (but it was an hour bus ride each <br/>\nway).  I was in that program 1 year before we moved again--from DC to <br/>\nChicago.  Again, my parents and three siblings sacrificed a lot so that <br/>\nI could go to the best school in the area (on the North Shore--where all <br/>\nthe John Hughes teen angst movies were filmed-- my high school was in <br/>\nthe nation&#39;s top 5).  We moved into a house that was way too small for <br/>\nthe 6 of us and needed major renovations so we could be in this very <br/>\naffluent school district. <br/>\n<br/>\nI entered 4th grade there halfway through the year.  On my first day of <br/>\nschool I proudly wore my favorite jump suit that my grandmother had made <br/>\nfor me.  It had a matching hat and was 100% polyester.  Before I was <br/>\neven welcomed into the classrom, I was scolded by the teacher for <br/>\nwearing a hat in class in front of everyone.  I was also teased <br/>\nmercilessly for having homemade polyester clothes instead of all the <br/>\n&quot;preppy&quot; fashions, which my family couldn&#39;t afford.  That was the <br/>\nbeginning of many years of hell, which included horrible teasing, mean <br/>\nteachers, and rare moments of actual learning.  This led to serious <br/>\nteenage rebellion, complete with drug use and ditching class.  The only <br/>\nthings that got me through it were being in orchestra and having a few <br/>\ngood teachers. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband was in one school system his whole life (Albuquerque) and <br/>\nspent most of grade school and middle school trying to figure out how to <br/>\nnot get beaten up.  He developed a deep rage that he still struggles <br/>\nwith today.  The only thing that saved him was joining a cajun music <br/>\ngroup (of adults--he was 14) and seeking solace from touring and the <br/>\ncompanionship of adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day a friend and I were at the store and we ran into a mutual <br/>\nacquaintance who we hadn&#39;t seen for a while.  The acquaintance asked me <br/>\nif I was still going to homeschool (our kids are all turning 5 this <br/>\nyear) and I said yes.  She asked my friend if they were too and she said <br/>\n&quot;hell, no!&quot;  I felt so sad to think that she wouldn&#39;t even consider the <br/>\neffects that school might have on her kids.  I said &quot;wow, if you asked <br/>\nme if I was going to send my kids to school the answer would be a <br/>\nresounding &#39;hell no!&#39;&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNO WAY!
