Since then this group has gone through a few changes. It used to be quite the happening place! I&#39;m not very sure why it has been so quiet lately. Even though the member number has risen, this must be due to newcomers lurking, waiting to see what everyone else is talking about. Probably a lot of people in this 600+ group have their mail set to &quot;no mail&quot; and check back occasionally. I&#39;m kind of a lurker myself. ;-) But I get e-mails every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any questions or basically anything at all you want to talk about, feel free to post. I think this group just needs people posting and maybe it can pick up again. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve broken my silent mode today. :o) <br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great unschooling day!<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca Brown wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very new to this group and was wondering if it is always this quiet?
