Is there any way you could meet<br/>\nsome real unschooled kids?  My son is almost 9 and has always been<br/>\nunschooled.  He has never filled out a math worksheet, and sometimes<br/>\nthis makes me nervous, but if you had a conversation with him about the<br/>\nsubject you would find that he knows a lot about math.  He&#39;s proof to me<br/>\nthat the method works.  He&#39;s also happy, creative, alert, and interested<br/>\nin lots of things that school children tend to find repulsive.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband taught junior high school in badly run school in a poor<br/>\nneighborhood last year.  Believe me, from his stories I learned how hard<br/>\nit is to make anyone learn something when they&#39;ve made up their mind not<br/>\nto learn.  (&quot;La la la, I&#39;m not liiiissssttteeennnning&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to let go of the idea, if you have it, that it&#39;s possible to have an<br/>\neducation without &quot;gaps&quot;.  Also, try to get rid of the idea that there<br/>\nis an appropriate sequence and speed for learning.  If you can dump<br/>\nthese two ideas, and never measure your kid against school frameworks,<br/>\nyou can probably enjoy watching your child develop.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, try searching the unschooling.com message boards for the word<br/>\n&quot;deschooling&quot;.
