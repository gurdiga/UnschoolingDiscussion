I found out last night that the 7th <br/>\ngrader doesn&#39;t know or understand fractions. Upon his arrival I found <br/>\nthat he is basically a functioning illiterate. If I don&#39;t stand over <br/>\nhim, the homework doesn&#39;t get done and the whole family has to stay <br/>\nup on in to the night &#39;til he&#39;s done.

And the solutions that feel<br/>\nright will be different.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Sandra suggested Clonlara is good. They&#39;ll help you as little or as much<br/>\nas you want in designing a personalized program.<br/>\n<br/>\nCommunity college could be an option too. (Depends on the laws in your<br/>\nstate.) The older ones could take just courses that truly interest them.<br/>\nThey might even take the GED and then not have to both with the rest of high<br/>\nschool. (There are courses and books and software to help prepare for it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there were a curriculum you could plug someone into based on their age<br/>\nand have it work, then schools would run perfectly, if you see what I mean.<br/>\nBut we all learn differently. Different styles. Different paces. If they<br/>\ndon&#39;t like school because their learning style is incompatible with school<br/>\nstyle learning, recreating school at home isn&#39;t going to work any better<br/>\nthan school at school. It&#39;s going to be stressful for them and stressful for<br/>\nyou. Not because there&#39;s something wrong with them but because there&#39;s<br/>\nsomething wrong with school/curriculum!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour daughter, on the other hand, since she&#39;s asking to homeschool ... you<br/>\nmay want to look into unschooling for her. (The most common cause of people<br/>\ngiving up on homeschooling is doing school at home. That isn&#39;t the only<br/>\noption!) With unschooling she can learn what she wants to learn and there&#39;s<br/>\nno stress or strain of &quot;making them do their work&quot;. We just help them pursue<br/>\nwhat they naturally are drawn to. It&#39;s very much like the way they learn to<br/>\nspeak English: learning is a side effect of using English to get what they<br/>\nwant.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of good books that give overviews of Homeschooling are:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Homeschooling Handbook<br/>\nThe Homeschooling Book of Answers<br/>\nThe Unschooling Handbook<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may want to check out the Home Education Magazine groups on Yahoo.
