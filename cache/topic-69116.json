While this is okay by me most of the time, sometimes<br/>\n&gt; its not. He doesn&#39;t like to let anything go past without understanding<br/>\n&gt; it. So he keeps interrupting the conversation with &quot;What did she say?&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;What did she mean when she said...&quot;, &quot;What did you mean when you said<br/>\n&gt; that...&quot; &quot;How...&quot; and so on. Whilst in principal I see no reason why he<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t be there or shouldn&#39;t take part in the conversation, his need<br/>\n&gt; for constant explanations kills the conversation. The person I am trying<br/>\n&gt; to talk to becomes frustrated, I become frustrated, we forget what we<br/>\n&gt; were talking about and often run out of time. On one occasion, a friend<br/>\n&gt; was trying to introduce me to someone, but James was so demanding that<br/>\n&gt; she ended up turning to the lady, throwing up her hands and saying &quot;It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; impossible to talk to Sue.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I get to a stage where I ask him to let me have a talk on my own to<br/>\n&gt; whoever, he is hurt and feels ostracized (He suffered a lot with<br/>\n&gt; bullying when in school) and just genuinely doesn&#39;t understand why I<br/>\n&gt; would need to talk to someone without him there. I then have to try and<br/>\n&gt; explain that we are not talking about him, not talking about anything<br/>\n&gt; top secret but that we do want to talk and are having trouble having a<br/>\n&gt; conversation with his over involvement. I try to explain that a<br/>\n&gt; conversation involves listening and talking but that with his constant<br/>\n&gt; questions he is monopolizing the conversation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes too there are conversations which are beyond his experience<br/>\n&gt; and whilst I don&#39;t want to give the impression that they are top secret,<br/>\n&gt; the conversation can&#39;t go beyond his understanding while he insists on a<br/>\n&gt; dictionary definition of every word. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do find the situation is a lot less stressful around people who have a<br/>\n&gt; more accepting view of children - unschoolers in particular but it still<br/>\n&gt; happens at a lower level. With people who expect to be able to talk<br/>\n&gt; exclusively to me and that the children will just go and play quietly<br/>\n&gt; somewhere, his needs seem to quadruple and I end up feeling overwhelmed<br/>\n&gt; by the struggle of trying to have a conversation. Then I hesitate to ask<br/>\n&gt; him to go away, because I know they will expect me to tell him to go<br/>\n&gt; away and punish him if he doesn&#39;t. I don&#39;t want to do that. When I ask<br/>\n&gt; him to go away he doesn&#39;t understand ends up crying and still doesn&#39;t go<br/>\n&gt; away. End of conversation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We have come so far in the time since we left school and began<br/>\n&gt; unschooling (two and a half years ago), but the emotional school scars<br/>\n&gt; are still there and I find it frustrating that visitors usually don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get to see us as we now are - far more relaxed and comfortable with each<br/>\n&gt; other - because of this conversation stress.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I want to respect James&#39; need for explanations, but also be able to meet<br/>\n&gt; my need to talk to people.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone got any advice?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Susan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
