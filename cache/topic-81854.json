They are NOT teaching history <br/>\nor science as the state would like for them to do.  They&#39;re teaching <br/>\nrevisionist and particularly written-for-Christians history and science.    Because <br/>\ntheir test scores are high, they don&#39;t figure anyone will question what else <br/>\nthey&#39;re teaching their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;That is both reality and their right to do so.

Otherwise, if a <br/>\nreporter (for example, or could be a politician or anyone) says &quot;I understand <br/>\nthat homeschoolers are keeping their children isolated,&quot; and if a <br/>\nhomeschooler says &quot;WHAT!?  That&#39;s ridiculous and couldn&#39;t be further from the truth,&quot; <br/>\nthat homeschooler has just made a very incorrect statement.  The best way to <br/>\nrespond would be to say &quot;Some do, but we don&#39;t, and the families we know are out <br/>\nhere, there, (wherever).&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s worth knowing. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhether we agree that it&#39;s good, or whether some want to blame unschoolers <br/>\nfor a &quot;rift&quot; with separatist homeschoolers, each person reading this should look <br/>\ninto that information for herself, or himself, OR if someone doesn&#39;t want to <br/>\nknow, then just be aware that there is something big out there you don&#39;t know, <br/>\nand don&#39;t defend someone or something without even looking at it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;In my personal opinion, the large majority of persons who want &quot;tests, ect&quot; <br/>\nare ex-professional teachers who have taught in an actual &quot;school&quot; <br/>\nenvironment, <br/>\nsuch as a public school or a private school, or has gone through &quot;teaching <br/>\ncollege&quot; and earned teaching credentials to actually &quot;teach&quot;.
