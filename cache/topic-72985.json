It seems like they are losing their <br/>\ncreativity and spontinaity(sp). I ask them what they would like to do or <br/>\nstudy, and they don&#39;t seem to know, esp my oldest. He has no real interests <br/>\noutside of looking at skateboard magazines and wearing dark, baggy clothes. He has <br/>\nbeen failing for years. I brought him home in the middle of last year, but he <br/>\nresisted the whole HS thing. He refused to HS this year. He failed his freshman <br/>\nyear, and will be taking a few summer classes. I think he feels disappointed <br/>\nwith himself but not sure what he wants to do. <br/>\n       My question is........how can I help him get back his interest and <br/>\ndesire to learn....anything?  I realize he can follow his skateboarding but he <br/>\nmostly just likes to look at the pics and hang them on his wall. If I could <br/>\nconvince him to HS I know he would have more freedom to learn without the pressure <br/>\nof homework etc., but he doesn&#39;t want to. He loves the PS social life. He has <br/>\nyouth group but is having trouble feeling like he fits in. He is a christian <br/>\nbut dresses differently. I have never seen anyone or heard anyone act judginly <br/>\ntowards him but he feels like they are.( I have worried that he might be <br/>\ndepressed but he has not been on any meds for it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLonda        &lt;A HREF=&quot;www.mymomishome.com&quot;&gt;www.mymomishome.com&lt;/A&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73401,"nextTopicId":73432}}
