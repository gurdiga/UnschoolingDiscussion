They want to know what they wrote<br/>\n(they are 7 and 5)  I have been bothered by the not reading thing, and<br/>\nthe no interest.  I also have a bad habit of comparing ect...  So here<br/>\nthey come with these papers, and proceed to tell me all the letters they<br/>\nwrote.  I didn&#39;t even know they knew a fraction of these letters.  I&#39;m<br/>\nthrilled!!
