I think unschooling is the<br/>\nnatural extension of the kind of parenting I&#39;m already doing. It makes<br/>\nno sense to me to trust her (and my) instincts for years and then, at an<br/>\narbitrary age, tell her those instincts are no longer valid. Anyway, my<br/>\npoint of posting was just to share what happened today. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were out in the driveway and dd was carrying around a small watering<br/>\ncan. I put some water in it for her and she dumped it out the top. She<br/>\nhanded it back to me and I put more water in and said &quot;here honey, let<br/>\nme show you how it works&quot; and proceeded to pour water out the spout<br/>\nwhile she watched. I handed it back to her and she dumped it out the top<br/>\nagain. I had the good sense to butt out at that point  :-) Instead of<br/>\ncontinuing to try to &quot;teach&quot; her the &quot;right way&quot; to do it, I just kept<br/>\nfilling it with water for her every time she handed it back to me. Over<br/>\nand over she kept dumping it out the top.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, I handed it back and she went to turn it upside down and the water<br/>\ncame out the spout! She stared at it as if she&#39;d never seen this before.<br/>\nShe was captivated and for most of the rest of the time we were out<br/>\nthere (almost an hour!) she poured the water out of the spout. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt just drove home the truth of what I already knew. I tried to &quot;teach&quot;<br/>\nher something and it did not register at all. But she discovers it for<br/>\nherself and it&#39;s a world of difference! It&#39;s just so hard not to be a<br/>\n&quot;teacher&quot; sometimes. To sit back and not show her the &quot;right way&quot; to<br/>\nstack the blocks, but to let her play with them as she will. I guess<br/>\nthis is me de-schooling 8-)<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon, Mom to Bridget (Oct.8.98)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6786,"nextTopicId":6790}}
