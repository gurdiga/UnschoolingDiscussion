What &quot;it&quot; is is a post from 1998, on a forum that  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t exist, but I printed it out then, so I&#39;m transcribing it here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: Re: Calling Sandra Dodd...<br/>\nDate: Tue, Sep 29, 1998<br/>\n From SandraDodd<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Oliver is looking over my shoulder, and he needs clarity on the  <br/>\ndifference between a battleaxe and a pike.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA battleaxe is a cranky old woman and a pike is a fish.<br/>\n<br/>\nA pike is longer and has to have a pokey thing on the end (speartip).  <br/>\nAn axehead is optional.<br/>\n<br/>\nA battleaxe is heavier, shorter, and the pokey thing is optional.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m saying this without looking in a book or calling my many  <br/>\nknowledgeable friends. BRB. (Did you know I was gone?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would ask my husband but he&#39;s off buying a caster for my kick stool  <br/>\n(because I&#39;m short), which brings up the question what is the  <br/>\ndifference between a caster (or is it castor? they do make that oil... <br/>\n[just joking]) and a wheel?<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay. I called my friend Jeff [a.k.a. Duke Artan MacAilin in the SCA].  <br/>\nHe&#39;s a word-freak and medieval combat practitioner. I read him my  <br/>\ndefinitions and he said &quot;that&#39;s it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to say something about knowing everything. I had a family  <br/>\nvisit my house last weekend. It was like an unschooling factory tour.  <br/>\nI was showing them toys and telling stories about how if kids have  <br/>\nplayed with all kinds of things and thereby gotten scientific  <br/>\nprinciples down in a sensory and intellectual kind of way, after  <br/>\nthey&#39;re older all that&#39;s left is the vocabulary, the terminology.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought a dictionary with my own money at the age of nine. I&#39;ve been  <br/>\naccused of being a know-it-all my whole life, but what I mostly know  <br/>\nis words. If you know the name for an alternator, if you know the  <br/>\ndifference between an alternator and a generator by definitions, it  <br/>\nwill seem you know about the electrical systems of cars, and you WILL  <br/>\nknow more than if you didn&#39;t know that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because I&#39;ve read about the Middle Ages for fun all my life and  <br/>\nthen hung around guys who talk about and make and use weapons, I just  <br/>\nknow. Same way people can tell a poodle from a greyhound (terminology)  <br/>\npeople gradually add to the details of their knowledge every day that  <br/>\nthey live.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why unschooling works. That&#39;s HOW unschooling works. Because  <br/>\nsomeone cares about the difference between a pike (the word &quot;pike&quot;)  <br/>\nand a battleaxe (the word and the parameters of its meaning).<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinitions. Look at the word itself, &quot;definitions.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOKAY! If you read this post carefully you&#39;ve just done more than many  <br/>\ncollege courses in philosophy do in an hour. Congratulations, you  <br/>\nunschooler!<br/>\n(I also put this here:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com\">http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":113213,"nextTopicId":113215}}
