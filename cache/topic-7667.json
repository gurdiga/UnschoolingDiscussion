The above quotes that you have <br/>\nattributed to sulan as argumentative were actually my words - I don&#39;t want <br/>\nyou to think that sulan was guilty when actually it was me!  Also, these <br/>\nwords WERE written from the viewpoint of a person who has chose not to <br/>\nbreastfeed.  It gets confusing with all the cutting and pasting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCould my words be read as argumentative?  Yep, I admit it.  Was I angry?  <br/>\nAbsolutely.  Lynda suggests that it would have been helpful for me to state <br/>\nwhat some of those valid reasons (for not breastfeeding) were.  But that is <br/>\nmy whole point - it is absolutely irrelevant what they were!  They are no <br/>\none&#39;s business and no one should pass judgment on my method of feeding my <br/>\nchild for ANY reason!  <br/>\n<br/>\nNotice that I never, EVER entered into a debate about whether breastmilk is <br/>\nbest for babies.  In fact, I stated that of course it IS best for babies.  <br/>\nBut some felt it necessary to argue the virtues of breastmilk and, taking it <br/>\na step further, compare formula to trash from a dumpster.  Why, in order to <br/>\nshow how good one thing is, is it necessary to state how bad another thing <br/>\nis???  It&#39;s true - the dumpster comments were NOT directed solely at me.  But <br/>\nthey definitely called into question the judgment of people who give their <br/>\nchildren formula.  The fact is, it was physically impossible for me to nurse <br/>\nthis baby.  If I followed the &quot;dumpster&quot; line of thinking and refused to use <br/>\nformula, then my baby would have starved.  Am I making a ridiculous argument <br/>\nhere?  Yes, of course!  I wouldn&#39;t let my baby starve!  But it seems to me to <br/>\nbe ridiculously obvious that if you can&#39;t nurse, then you use formula, and <br/>\nthere&#39;s absolutely no sense in dwelling on its &quot;dumpster&quot;-like qualities.  It <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t do anyone any good to hear about them, and it could easily be seen <br/>\n(NOT just by me, but by numerous folks on the list who have emailed me) as <br/>\ninflammatory, smug, and self-satisfied. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not responding to your post in order to further this - I just wanted to <br/>\nmake sure that argumentative statements attributed to sulan were correctly <br/>\nattributed to me.  Fair is fair, and I&#39;ll take the rap for my own words!  <br/>\nThanks for your thoughts on all this.  I love your posts, and look forward to <br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** KiM ***<br/>\nruns with scissors</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;Tracy@...-online.co.uk&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"zrvvYeQR6jVnhGJdrIIzsRQv7wsHnJFDZ1x3u3ROtmpyQxf25ghUd-baRlbkhJq5NwqA9FdIpxbP--74fxgADCJi0b4AZ8QLwjmqXz15rfgf6uzd3PRQFb_v","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] champagne moment...","postDate":"954974573","msgId":7809,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwY2EwMWJmOWY1MyQxZmUzZmJjMCRjNTQxOWZkNEBsaW5rMTA1MjY2Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDYxLjI4NWVmNjguMjYxYjNlZGZAYW9sLmNvbT4gPDAwNzAwMWJmOWU2OCQ0MWJjMjU2MCRiZDQ5OWZkNEBsaW5rMTA1MjY2PiA8MzhFQTQ0MDEuRDI2M0NBREVAaWh1Zy5jby5uej4gPDAwOGQwMWJmOWU4NSRkOWU1ODU4MCRiZDQ5OWZkNEBsaW5rMTA1MjY2PiA8MzhFQUM2MUIuQTE1QjQyOTZAaWh1Zy5jby5uej4="},"prevInTopic":7783,"nextInTopic":7910,"prevInTime":7808,"nextInTime":7810,"topicId":7667,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Probably more like the woman who runs Sid s Cafe (which really exists) can t remember her name, but younger :-) Tracy ...
