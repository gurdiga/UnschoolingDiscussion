For years now, ever since Jack was born over seven <br/>\n  years ago, I have been fighting some pretty nasty health problems. Actually I <br/>\n  had problems with my pregnancy with Moly; I bled throughout my pregnancy with <br/>\n  her and gained over 100 pounds. Then she was born about six weeks early and my <br/>\n  placenta looked funny to my OBGYN so he ordered some tests. Those came back <br/>\n  that I had probably been carrying twins and that the reason I bled throughout my <br/>\n  pregnancy was that I had lost one. I never really lost the extra weight from <br/>\n  that pregnancy, had a miscarriage, then got pregnant with Jack where I gained <br/>\n  even more weight (again almost 100 pounds) and my kidneys started to fail. <br/>\n  After Jack was born, I never went back to having normal periods and started <br/>\n  gaining weight at a rate of around four to six (sometimes more) pounds a month. <br/>\n<br/>\n  After going without periods for a few years and having numerous D & C&#39;s, <br/>\n  (five in the past seven years) I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, <br/>\n  without the polycystic ovaries. Two years ago my OB found precancerous cells on <br/>\n  my cervix and right inside my uterus. That was taken care of with some <br/>\n  painful procedures! And thankfully everything with that has been resolved. About a <br/>\n  year ago my OB, my internist and I got together and reviewed all my symptoms <br/>\n  and discussed what to do about my weight and other related problems. They let me <br/>\n  know that I was kind of in a catch 22. I had to loose the weight to help <br/>\n  resolve the medical problems, but the medical problems would prevent me from <br/>\n  loosing the weight! So we discussed weight loss surgery. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, after a year, almost to the date of that consultation, I have been <br/>\n  approved by insurance to have the surgery! I am now waiting to be put on my <br/>\n  surgeon&#39;s operating schedule but by this time next year I should be a smaller, <br/>\n  healthier me! <br/>\n<br/>\n  Darin and I have always wanted more kids and since Jack I have been basically <br/>\n  infertile. I am so excited because loosing all this weight will resolve or <br/>\n  help resolve most of my symptoms of PCOS. So while we are very excited about me <br/>\n  loosing the weight, we are really ecstatic about the thought of maybe a baby <br/>\n  in the next year or two! <br/>\n<br/>\n  If you pray, or light candles, or send good thoughts, or what ever you do... <br/>\n  please keep me and especially my family in your thoughts.

I have the insulin resistant type, which you probably do,  as<br/>\nseen in the weight gain.  I now feel my body metabolism responds more<br/>\nappropriately to food.   The insulin difficulty,  according to my Doc,<br/>\nis that your body produces insulin in correct levels to the carbs you<br/>\neat,  but the insulin does not absorb well.  SO your body craves more<br/>\ncarbs,  so that you have to produce excessive insulin and then your body<br/>\nwill finally absorb enough to make you be satisfied....however,  you<br/>\nhave eaten extra food and therefore, inevitably gain weight.  My niece<br/>\nwas the first in our family to be diagnosed.  She has lost over fifty<br/>\npounds and kept it off for almost 2 years now.  She will take glucophage<br/>\nthe rest of her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you well with it all.  My OB/Gyn is fully supportive of the<br/>\nprogram....says untreated PCOS usually takes 20 yrs off life<br/>\nexpectancy....the risk for heart disease,  diabetes,  is 80% higher than<br/>\n&quot;normal&quot; population.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dnowens@...\">Dnowens@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dnowens@...\">Dnowens@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Saturday, September 06, 2003 2:41 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] OT: Good news kind of long, but I<br/>\nwanted to share<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got some good news!

For years now, ever since Jack was born over seven <br/>\nyears ago, I have been fighting some pretty nasty health problems. Actually I <br/>\nhad problems with my pregnancy with Moly; I bled throughout my pregnancy with <br/>\nher and gained over 100 pounds. Then she was born about six weeks early and my <br/>\nplacenta looked funny to my OBGYN so he ordered some tests. Those came back <br/>\nthat I had probably been carrying twins and that the reason I bled throughout my <br/>\npregnancy was that I had lost one. I never really lost the extra weight from <br/>\nthat pregnancy, had a miscarriage, then got pregnant with Jack where I gained <br/>\neven more weight (again almost 100 pounds) and my kidneys started to fail. <br/>\nAfter Jack was born, I never went back to having normal periods and started <br/>\ngaining weight at a rate of around four to six (sometimes more) pounds a month. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter going without periods for a few years and having numerous D & C&#39;s, <br/>\n(five in the past seven years) I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, <br/>\nwithout the polycystic ovaries. Two years ago my OB found precancerous cells on <br/>\nmy cervix and right inside my uterus. That was taken care of with some <br/>\npainful procedures! And thankfully everything with that has been resolved. About a <br/>\nyear ago my OB, my internist and I got together and reviewed all my symptoms <br/>\nand discussed what to do about my weight and other related problems. They let me <br/>\nknow that I was kind of in a catch 22. I had to loose the weight to help <br/>\nresolve the medical problems, but the medical problems would prevent me from <br/>\nloosing the weight! So we discussed weight loss surgery. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, after a year, almost to the date of that consultation, I have been <br/>\napproved by insurance to have the surgery! I am now waiting to be put on my <br/>\nsurgeon&#39;s operating schedule but by this time next year I should be a smaller, <br/>\nhealthier me! <br/>\n<br/>\nDarin and I have always wanted more kids and since Jack I have been basically <br/>\ninfertile. I am so excited because loosing all this weight will resolve or <br/>\nhelp resolve most of my symptoms of PCOS. So while we are very excited about me <br/>\nloosing the weight, we are really ecstatic about the thought of maybe a baby <br/>\nin the next year or two! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you pray, or light candles, or send good thoughts, or what ever you do... <br/>\nplease keep me and especially my family in your thoughts.
