Thanks to a couple of eGroup members who alerted me to \nthe fact that this virus had been transmitted with my e-mail, I was able to use \nmy Norton AntiVirus program and eventually remove the kak virus from my \ncomputer.&nbsp; It was found lurking in the signature part of my Outlook \nExpress.&nbsp; </font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I, therefore, apologize for any problems or \ninconvenience this has caused others.&nbsp;
