However, that was in the Twin Cities, where there were lots of <br/>\ncustomers but also lots of expenses, which resulted in the business being <br/>\nvery much full time.  This time, we are looking at the areas that are 2 hrs <br/>\nor more from the Cities, maybe within an hour of St. Cloud, a smaller city <br/>\nwith a university that some of our family may use.<br/>\n     In these areas, land is much less expensive, plus they are very pretty <br/>\nand peaceful.  My sister lives in Minneapolis and always enjoys our visits so <br/>\nwhen we want that city life, we can always go see her.<br/>\n     We want to be able to meet all of our basics with his retirement so that <br/>\nif one of us chooses to work for pay, it can be just to pay for a certain <br/>\nthing, such as a trip we want to take.  I know it sounds crazy to a lot of <br/>\npeople but I truly believe it can be done.<br/>\n     By the way, I checked out that site on adult freedom and it was great.  <br/>\nI enjoyed your essays.  Your experiences in life sound quite varied and <br/>\ninteresting.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    Lucy Saliger</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3647,"nextTopicId":3636}}
