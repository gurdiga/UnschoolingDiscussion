Both of my kids are extremely social and<br/>\nextremely active. They love to be going, doing, inviting friends over,<br/>\nriding bikes, going swimming, doing homeschool group activities, non-stop!<br/>\nThis is no surprise as both DH and I are extremely social and extremely<br/>\nactive and have always been that way.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that there&#39;s anything wrong with someone who likes to be<br/>\nmoving, doing something, going somewhere and isn&#39;t too fond of staying in<br/>\nthe same place. To me, it&#39;s largely a temperament issue, and while other<br/>\nkids might be very happy to hang out at home and do something familiar, my<br/>\nkids aren&#39;t. Accepting that is part of being a parent to my kids. On the<br/>\nother hand, I know how exhausting it can be to be the parent to such a<br/>\nperson, even if I can totally empathize with their needs.<br/>\nI&#39;ve more or less resigned myself to the fact that our lives will be very,<br/>\nvery busy for the next few years. And that our house will be &quot;the house&quot;<br/>\nwhere kids are always congregating. And very rare are the days when we just<br/>\nstay at home the whole day. But then, my life wasn&#39;t like that before having<br/>\nkids. If I had a day all to myself, I&#39;d figure out someplace to go,<br/>\nsomething to do, some new thing I wanted to try. So why expect my kids to be<br/>\nany different? The best thing I can do is to facilitate, as  best as I can,<br/>\ntheir needs for motion, companionship, and new and exciting things to do,<br/>\nsee, learn. If it&#39;s not possible to meet those needs out of the house, I try<br/>\nto figure out what&#39;s in the house that can help. If it&#39;s a rainy day, I<br/>\nmight pull the car out of the garage and they can ride bikes or skate or<br/>\ndraw with chalk on the garage floor.
