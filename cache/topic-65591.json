Some things that have appeal for both:<br/>\nOwls in the Family  (forgotten author) <br/>\nRascal by Sterling North<br/>\nThe Incredible Journey<br/>\n(can you tell we like animals?)<br/>\nThe Enchanted Forest Series by Patricia Wrede could also appeal to several levels, as it has adventure and mixed up fairy tale characters keep showing up in clever ways, which is funny for older listeners. These were our faves for a loooong time. <br/>\nSometimes we just have to read seperately, but right now we are reading Streams to the River, River to the Sea, about Sacajawea. I just don&#39;t read the really gory parts aloud, sometimes have older dd 14 read that paragraph to herself. (like the description of a buffalo bull dying, etc.) Younger dd does not want to hear it. <br/>\nInstead of reading aloud to them whatever they are reading at the moment, I usually pick a book that we are reading aloud together, one that I think will interest both. <br/>\nMary T. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65583,"nextTopicId":65594}}
