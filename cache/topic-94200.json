WOW.  I wasn&#39;t expecting that.  I knew when he prescribed that that he was very willing to work with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I went to the pharmacy though, I discovered that Oxycodone is a derivative of codeine, which I&#39;m allergic to.

Tightwad Gazettes? *****<br/>\n<br/>\nYup.  They are great books. Miserly moms was especially helpful.  I still have it, maybe I&#39;ll go back and re-read it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of our expenses go toward the house (which really isn&#39;t that much), insurance, and the kids&#39; activities.  I&#39;ve downsized on the house and insurance as far as I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could cut the kids&#39; activities but I&#39;m not willing to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my worries don&#39;t come from people engaging me.  It comes from hearing people talk about *others* in such negative tones.  Hearing it makes me wonder what they are saying about *me*, and then I try to anticipate every possible thing I could change to head it all off at the pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know its totally ridiculous!!  Nobody can please everyone. And I&#39;m sure 80% of their negativity comes from something other than work, so there is nothing I can do about it anyway. But knowing that intellectually doesn&#39;t seem to make it easier to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the reasons I cut back to every other weekend was to minimize my exposure to all that stuff.  But in the last 6 weeks, I&#39;ve picked up many more hours, partly because I have things I want to do that I need to pay for, and partly because we are short staffed currently.  Its probably the increased hours that have taken its toll on me.  Fortunately, except for 2 shifts, I have the next 3 weeks off and then I&#39;m back to my regular schedule again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of my internalizing has to do with how I was treated growing up.  I was held responsible for everything, including every bad day or mood my mother had. I was a child and I was taught to believe that if only *I* would change, my world would be better; that it was all *my* fault that I wasn&#39;t happy, or that she was in a bad mood.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was an emotinoally abusive relationship.   And its even harder now to feel angry about it because she has changed so much and she knows what she did was wrong and regrets it.  We are best friends now.  To her credit, she was raised in a physically AND emotionally abusive home.  In her commendable effort to stop the cycle of physical abuse, she didn&#39;t realize how much emotional abuse was happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the pain and the scars are still there, and they affect the way I see situations now.  I have a great tendency to internalize everyone else&#39;s negativity because that was what I was taught to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to unlearn it, but its hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can remember one time in my life when I felt at peace.  It was when I was taking Martial Arts.  Amazing how paradoxical that is!  But its the only time I ever felt completely centered.  Maybe its because Martial arts is so empowering in so many ways:  physical, self defense, mental discipline, concentration.  Every time I left class, I felt like I had immersed myself in an hour of meditation because of the amount of focus that was required.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may go back to that, but I picked up a book on yoga.  I think yoga might do the same thing for me. It felt so good to do those exercises last night, and I really did break a sweat!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m heading out to the doc&#39;s in an hour.  I&#39;ll get some prophylactic meds for now, until I can see if the Yoga will help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this got so long!<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":179193104,"authorName":"agarpearl","from":"&quot;agarpearl&quot; &lt;agar11@...&gt;","profile":"agarpearl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Exhaustion","postDate":"1084899202","msgId":94249,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM4ZGYyMit0ZmY5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMWMwMWM0M2MzNyRlODVmNjQxMCQwMjAxYThjMEBhby5sb3AuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":94247,"nextInTopic":94253,"prevInTime":94248,"nextInTime":94250,"topicId":94200,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have had moderate to wonderful success with this herbal treatment for migraine (and other types of) headaches.

I&#39;m more <br/>\n&gt;likely to let someone sleep than to wake them up just to brush their <br/>\n&gt;teeth.  Or I will ask someone if they want me to rub their back, instead <br/>\n&gt;of just doing it.  If they say no, I don&#39;t have a problem with waiting <br/>\n&gt;till later.  If I do a chemstick and a drop of blood gets on the sheet, I <br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t change the whole entire bed unless it bothers the patient or it <br/>\n&gt;could harm the patient in some way not to.  Many of these patients are in <br/>\n&gt;a lot of pain, and are on complete bedrest.  It might take them a good <br/>\n&gt;hour to get settled and comfortable in a new position.

I don&#39;t particularly <br/>\nlike this trait, but it is as I am, hence, I am careful to associate with <br/>\npeople whom I don&#39;t mind being influenced by.

So I guess what I need are <br/>\nstrategies for coping with the people there.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When I was student teaching I also dealt with very negative people, <br/>\nboth negative about my parenting, about my style of teaching, etc.  <br/>\nIt was very different in that it was only a few months, but what <br/>\nhelped me was learning not to engage.  I have a difficult time <br/>\nnot &quot;Coming up&quot; for lack of a better word when people engage me ...  <br/>\nIt began affecting my mothering and my marriage and my husband <br/>\nfinally sat me down and told me to back off at school.  When my <br/>\nadvisor came to me the next day and said my ideals were too high for <br/>\npublic schools, instead of engaging her, I simply listened, absorbed <br/>\nwhat I wanted, and let the rest roll off.  I took a deep breath, <br/>\nsmiled, and she moved on.  Since I decided not to come back, it went <br/>\nmore easily.  I put this to practice and ate by myself, hung out <br/>\nwith the kids instead of the teachers, etc.  It ticked a lot of <br/>\npeople off but it kept me sane.  And I just kept smiling at <br/>\neveryone.  They stopped engaging me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThink about what you might tell your kids if they were having the <br/>\nsame problem; &quot;Ignore them; they&#39;re only doing/saying [whatever] for <br/>\nyour reaction.&quot;  It works for grownups too.  If you smile and ignore <br/>\nthem, or say in a kind (rather than sarcastic) voice &quot;I really <br/>\nappreciate how your opinion helps me see both sides of that issue,&quot; <br/>\nthey&#39;ll probably back off some.  Couple that with avoiding them, <br/>\nmaybe eating your dinner either solo in the caf or with a patient, <br/>\nspending breaks reading by yourself or reading to your patients, you <br/>\nmight find a bit of serenity. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as living debt free, have you read the Miserly Moms book or <br/>\nAmy Dacyzon&#39;s (sp?) Tightwad Gazettes?  It might give you some <br/>\ninsight on a few more places to cut back, slimming your time toward <br/>\ndebt-freedom.  One thing that motivates dh and I in our crazy life <br/>\nis to keep a debt chart on the fridge and see how it slims down each <br/>\nmonth.

Visualize yourself inside a bubble that only<br/>\nallows in positive energies.  Positive energies are blue.  Negatives are<br/>\npink.

When it hits your bubble, it bursts into thousands of tiny<br/>\nblue positive energies that bounce around the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds crazy but they really do work.

I get chronic headaches, they are tension headaches and I&#39;ve had them all my life, but they can be incapacitating and they are increasing in frequency.  They are also becoming refractory to anything I take for them.  I have a doctor appointment tomorrow to get some prophylactic meds, but I think there is more going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m thinking is that I seem to be absorbing a lot of guilt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI work in an ICU, which I love, but the people I work with are very much control freaks.  I&#39;m not nearly as intense as they are about being in control.  Needless to say, my parenting style is in direct contradiction to everything they believe.  A few times I&#39;ve actually been confronted with my &quot;lack of&quot; whatever they think I&#39;m lacking in with my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t really talk about parenting much, and I really *don&#39;t* care what they think about my parenting, because I know I&#39;m doing the right thing,   but the differences between us also get reflected in patient care.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI treat my patients with the same respect I have for my kids.  I&#39;m more likely to let someone sleep than to wake them up just to brush their teeth.  Or I will ask someone if they want me to rub their back, instead of just doing it.  If they say no, I don&#39;t have a problem with waiting till later.  If I do a chemstick and a drop of blood gets on the sheet, I don&#39;t change the whole entire bed unless it bothers the patient or it could harm the patient in some way not to.  Many of these patients are in a lot of pain, and are on complete bedrest.  It might take them a good hour to get settled and comfortable in a new position.  These are not the kind of patients where you fuss over every little thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have actually gotten flack for this kind of thing.  Anyone who works with a majority of controlling women knows that these women will take the few facts that they have, add their own emotions (that might come from anywhere, not just work), extrapolate from the mix, and then draw conlcusions about people that may or may not be accurate.  Then they sit around and discuss their conclusions, with even more people present.  Hmmm, kind of sounds like a group of traditional moms and their kids doesn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I can honestly &quot;not care&quot; what anyone thinks.  But I&#39;m not that kind of person.  Being the person I am, believing that there is always &quot;another way&quot;, and always evaluating what I do, I am vulnerable to guilt tactics.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt home, my husband is also a control freak.  He is a good man and I love him.  But he is another one that thinks life is to be lived a certain way, and his way is the only way.  He does the martyr thing, which I can&#39;t stand, and its all about laying guilt trips on everyone else in the family.  Its better than it used to be, and when I call him on it when it he will back off, but it still leaves me feeling guilty.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what I need more than anything is a change.  But I&#39;m not sure what change to make.  Well, maybe I am.  What I really want is to quit my job, have my husband quit his, move to some remote location, live off the land, and take care of my kids free of all the negative input of the rest of the world.  For example......move to Japan and live like the people in &quot;The Last Samari&quot;  (what a GREAT movie!).  But how realistic is that??? LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know that the only way to lose this constant feeling of guilt is to stop surrounding myself with such negative people.  But I&#39;m not sure that can be done either :o).  <br/>\nI make very good money and only work every other weekend.  We will be debt free in another 3 years.  I keep telling myself I can hold out that long (I&#39;ve already been there 16 years).  But I wonder if I really can.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I could at least quit my job, I could concentrate more on what makes my husband happy but then I&#39;d get the guilt trip over the fact that he&#39;s working and I&#39;m not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else in this sinking boat?
