The two middle children Dd9 and Ds6 were each","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1682351550\">I haven&#39;t been posting for a long while but i thought I would tell you<br/>\nwhat has happened so far in our house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe two middle children Dd9 and Ds6 were each given their own bedrooms<br/>\nwhen we moved into our new house.  They had previously shared a room <br/>\nDd9 on top bunk Ds6 on bottom.  Dd9 was given the bunk bed in the new<br/>\nhouse as we assumed that Dd4 would want to start sleeping in her own<br/>\nbed soon (year and a half latter she&#39;s still in ours).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt stayed that way for six moths, each in thier own bed.  Then they<br/>\nstarted the mucical bed thing with everyone,  somtimes our bed<br/>\nsometimes Big brothers somtimes eachothers.  this lasted for two to<br/>\nthree months.  Then Dd9 and Ds6 decided to share her top bunk and have<br/>\nbeen there ever since (mostly anyway).  Ds6&#39;s room stayed basicly<br/>\nvacant except to change clothes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a few months and some discussion his room is now the TV room. <br/>\nHis bed is set up with lots of pillows -like a day bed- so we can be<br/>\ncozy, but he still has a place to sleep if he chooses to sleep alone.<br/>\n If and when he wants his room to himself we can just move his dresser<br/>\nback in and put the TV back down stairs.  No big deal less waste of<br/>\nspace.  The larger then neccesary area we priviously had the TV in<br/>\ndown stairs has most of their toys it right now and I&#39;m guessing that<br/>\nby the time he wants to sleep in his own room there will be less space<br/>\nneeded for toys anyway.  The bedrooms aren&#39;t large either aprox. 9feet<br/>\nby 10 feet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey both have some different areas for different toys throughout the<br/>\nhouse.  Dd is not the most organised child so Ds keeps his toys he<br/>\nwants organised -like bionicles- in his big brothers room.  The rest<br/>\njust end up in one of the many storgage container in the play area in<br/>\nthe basement.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sugestion.  Do some brainstorming with them.  What kinds of ideas<br/>\ndo they have?  Does one of them really want to decorate or have a<br/>\ntheamed room?  Do they have similar sleep habits?  One of the reasons<br/>\nsharing separate rooms didn&#39;t work so well for our two was that one<br/>\nwas a late riser the other get&#39;s up between six and seven every day. <br/>\nHe couldn&#39;t play quietly with his toys while the rest of the house<br/>\nslept with out waking her.  His brother gets up early too so having<br/>\nhis quiet play toys in his room wasnt as disruptive.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure if it&#39;s helpfull.  It is what has worked for us.  So Far.<br/>\nGood Luck Teresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, MarSi77@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi !<br/>\n&gt;  I haven&#39;t posted in a very long time but I know I could get good<br/>\nsuggestions <br/>\n&gt; from all of you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   We are at the point in our new house that my two youngest ( ds<br/>\n91/2, dd <br/>\n&gt; almost 8) can have their own rooms.
