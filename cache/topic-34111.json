People have <br/>\nalways had problems with mice, and the perfect solution has never been found.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have cats.  Sometimes the cats get tired of chasing mice, and you need <br/>\nnewer cats.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you have more mice than you&#39;re willing to have cats to cover, then <br/>\ntraps are probably better than other ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nPutting something around your house might be more likely to keep them in than <br/>\nout.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a frame house or a basement, they will have lots of places to <br/>\nlive.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeal ALL holes.  It&#39;s hard in old houses.   Get caulk and spackling and seal <br/>\nodd corners in cabinets, and around pipes, and every single where.<br/>\n<br/>\nMouse traps are not expensive.  Instead of having two, get a dozen or more, <br/>\nand do a big pass.  Maybe hire a neighboring boy if the thing is too <br/>\ndistasteful for you, to set and check and re-set them.  But instead of <br/>\ncatching one or two a day, send them all to their next life (or the dust) at <br/>\nonce.  If you do is slowly, you have more stressful days AND the free ones <br/>\nare off celebrating their lives by making more mice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I had kids I didn&#39;t care too much about mice.  I thought they were <br/>\ncute.  But when I had babies they became a threat to the safety of the future <br/>\nof MY brood, and the smiting began.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur new house doesn&#39;t have mice inside.  We&#39;ve seen some cat-catches outside. <br/>\n If we didn&#39;t have cats, I&#39;m sure some would move on in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":55326806,"authorName":"rumpleteasermom","from":"&quot;rumpleteasermom&quot; &lt;rumpleteasermom@...&gt;","profile":"rumpleteasermom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Any remedies to get mice out of your house!?","postDate":"1018099015","msgId":34129,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE4bXNnNytrOXRmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGQ2LjE0OTM5YzMxLjI5ZGY4MmExQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34116,"nextInTopic":34136,"prevInTime":34128,"nextInTime":34130,"topicId":34111,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"CATS ... pepper ... these ... want to use","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-638058111\">CATS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., Unschoolingmommy@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have got mouse houses that we are using but is there anything like <br/>\npepper <br/>\n&gt; around your borders of your house or something natural to use to get <br/>\nthese <br/>\n&gt; guys outside.
