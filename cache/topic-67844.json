It would crush him.  He&#39;s very strong-<br/>\nwilled and very much a thinker, but he will only follow instructions <br/>\nif they sound more interesting than what he was already planning.  If <br/>\nmy child had been more of a compliant Suzy Sunshine, I can see myself <br/>\nbuying a Kindergarten curriculum and sitting down at the dining room <br/>\ntable every day at eight in the morning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has such a forceful personality, and is so opinionated, that <br/>\nif public school was the only option I would feel sorry for his <br/>\nteacher as well as him.  There&#39;s just no getting him to do what you <br/>\nwant unless it&#39;s what he wants.  I can remember growing up, my mom <br/>\nconsidered me &quot;defiant&quot;, &quot;disobedient&quot;, &quot;mouthy&quot;, and all those other <br/>\nlovely things, and she felt it was her job to beat me into <br/>\nsubmission.  When my son was little I decided not to think of him in <br/>\nthose terms and to let him grow up without breaking his spirit.  And <br/>\nbelieve me, school would break his spirit.  But if he&#39;d been a <br/>\ndifferent kind of child, I&#39;d have been a different kind of parent, <br/>\nand likely I&#39;d write some book in ten years bragging about my child <br/>\nreading in Latin when he was four years old.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time my son was browsing the library and came across a book about <br/>\nIQ testing and asked me what it was.  I told him it was a test.  He <br/>\nwanted to take it.  The first question had a bunch of pictures and it <br/>\nasked if you would find any of them in a garden.  He said, &quot;Yes, the <br/>\ncat.&quot;  I told him it&#39;s quite likely you&#39;d find a cat in a garden.  <br/>\nWhat about the flowers, though?  He said, &quot;No, you wouldn&#39;t find a <br/>\nvase of cut flowers in a garden.  That would be silly!&quot;  And then he <br/>\nwandered off to look at something different.  And I thought about how <br/>\nmuch smarter he is than whoever made the test, and I knew I was <br/>\nmaking the right decision to let his mind grow its own way rather <br/>\nthan training it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorcha</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"Heidi","from":"&quot;Heidi&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Learning styles and homeschooling methods (long)","postDate":"1052314647","msgId":67909,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI5YjI2bit0dWZ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGI5OXVtZitlbW5jQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67896,"nextInTopic":67911,"prevInTime":67908,"nextInTime":67910,"topicId":67844,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe a kid will get TO Homer, by way of Harry Potter!

We dabbled in Waldorf homeschooling for my daughter&#39;s K year.  Mostly we did circle time and really got into the seasonal celebrations.  I&#39;ve always loved celebrating the seasons, but I learned about new ones I hadn&#39;t heard of before like midsummer and also found some new traditions to add to our regular celebrations.  That was a wonderful thing to learn about.  Now, we don&#39;t follow anything else from Waldorf, but those things we learned about have enriched our family ever since.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of years ago I read some information about Charlotte Mason homeschooling.  Although we never implemented any of the techniques in a structured way, I was impressed with the emphasis on nature study.  I am a field biologist by training, but hadn&#39;t done much since the kids were born.  So, I started keeping a nature journal for my own benefit.  Now my daughter has one as well, but she works on it in her own way and time.  We have a great time getting out our journals, pens and paints and getting out in nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am thankful that I found out about these things because they have enhanced my life.  I think in that way they have become interesting to my children, but I didn&#39;t necessarily plan on that happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tHeather Woodward [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bacwoodz@...\">bacwoodz@...</a>]<br/>\n<br/>\nI read the Well Trained Mind as well and really thought it sounded wonderful. Some of the ideas from the book have been  incorporated into life. We have the book &#39;English from the Roots Up&quot; and write a root word on our wipe off board once a week. We also like the game Rummy Roots.  - but this is fun! The overall structure of the approach was rather daunting to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlotte Mason placed a lot of emphasis on nature as well - and that has played a lot into our day. We have been actively bird watching. I have been writing down the types of birds we see in the back of my bird book. My 5y ds now writes birds down as well. It will take him so long to write &#39;Blue Jay&#39; but he really wants to do this! He walks around with a clipboard and asks how to spell things. He doesn&#39;t get all the letters correct - but I am finding it so exciting to see him learning - without any phonics lessons, or workbooks etc.  but because he feels a need to write down whatever he finds important.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo overall, I can see how some of the ideas in these books are good ones - I also can&#39;t see us following anything like this structurally because it creates too much stress - and then when life happens -or interests change - it just doesn&#39;t work - at least for us. Maybe others have found it to be different -<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"jmcseals SEALS","from":"&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Learning styles and homeschooling methods (long)","postDate":"1052288828","msgId":67889,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjI4WUhMQlFoRXhraXkwMDAwMjE5ZUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":67883,"nextInTopic":67893,"prevInTime":67888,"nextInTime":67890,"topicId":67844,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-164018439\">&lt;&lt; Buzz words like<br/>\ncurriculum, lessons, and teaching scare them and send them in a defensive<br/>\nfrenzy.

Now don&#39;t jump me for doing this, okay? &lt;bg&gt;  Just for sh**s and <br/>\ngiggles, I looked up the word lesson.  Of course, there are various <br/>\ninterpretations depending upon usage, but here goes:<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson: new or better knowledge: some useful knowledge or sense that results <br/>\nfrom direct experience<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;m not calling my kids to the table saying, &quot;Ok children, today we are <br/>\ngoing to learn how to make bread!&quot;  I may decide to make bread today and <br/>\nmore likely than not, at least two of the girls want to come in and help.  <br/>\nThe excitement spreads and I end up with five sets of hands ready to knead.  <br/>\nHaleigh wants help in understanding how to read the recipe.  Nicholette <br/>\nwants to knead but isn&#39;t sure how.  Lauren wants to break eggs and Hannah <br/>\nand Ethan are purely interested in how much flour it takes to cover the <br/>\nentire kitchen.  By the time the dough goes into the oven, Haleigh and <br/>\nNicholette are the only two still aware of the fact that we are making <br/>\nbread.  The other kids are making car tracks in the floury floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in the definition above of &#39;lesson&#39;, all the kids have had their own <br/>\nmaking of a &#39;lesson&#39; in baking bread.  In this sense, I still see it as a <br/>\nbuzz word.  I find that in the ps community, they think they *own* the word <br/>\n&#39;learn&#39; as well.  I&#39;m sure everyone here has probably heard at least one <br/>\nperson say, in response to &#39;we home/unschool&#39;, &quot;How will they LEARN blah, <br/>\nblah, blah???&quot;  As if being in ps was the only way to &#39;learn&#39; anything!  We <br/>\n(unschoolers) just happen to hold on to that particular word and don&#39;t <br/>\nsolely connect it with &quot;school&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I can see that those new to unschooling (and maybe even some of the <br/>\nvets)  may still hold on to the ps baggage associated with those words.  But <br/>\npersonally, I can see the &quot;lessons&quot; in learning without specifically having <br/>\nto verbalize or analyze them as such.   For all intents and purposes here, <br/>\nthough, I am willing to work on excluding them from my vocabulary for the <br/>\nsake of those who cannot make the distinctions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to cause another uproar, just attempting to explain the <br/>\nmeaning as I see it, use it and understand it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer, grabbing the umbrella :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people keep the &quot;buzz words&quot; they also keep the concepts and the baggage<br/>\nand the expectations.  There are serious and profound advantages to moving<br/>\nfrom curriculum/lessons/teaching to life/opportunities/learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the other side of the same coin.  One is limited and prescribed and<br/>\nfocused on the teacher.

We&#39;d all <br/>\nsit there mesmerized by the grossest things...it was great!  If anyone ever <br/>\nfell asleep in class, he would actually make us all whisper so they could <br/>\nsleep!  THEN, he&#39;d hold Saturday classes for make-up in case any of us <br/>\nhappened to snooze on the clock.

We did do the school-at-home method for 2 months, and <br/>\nwhile she loved it, I got very bored with it.  And I do have to admit <br/>\nI LOVE looking at curricula.  I loved workbooks and flashcards and <br/>\nwall charts.  But I did not like going by the &quot;scripts&quot; that the <br/>\nteachers&#39; manuals have.  It didn&#39;t feel like teaching, it felt like <br/>\nparroting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe main reason I decided I would homeschool (before I even had my <br/>\ndaughter) was because I knew that though I always made A&#39;s in school, <br/>\nI never was remotely challenged to meet my potential.  When I <br/>\ngraduated from my community college, I was offered a full-tuition <br/>\nscholarship to New College in Sarasota.  That is an &quot;honors&quot; college <br/>\nwhere there are no grades, you design your own degree, and study what <br/>\nyou choose.  The teachers are mainly there for support and guidance <br/>\nwhen asked for it.  (At least that is what the college claimed to be, <br/>\nI never went or knew anyone who went...I chose instead to move to NC <br/>\nand get married.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted so badly to go to that college, because I felt like some <br/>\nactual learning might take place there.  But anyway, I ended up <br/>\ngoing to UNC-Chapel Hill and majoring in a field <br/>\nwhere the teachers (and I use that term loosely) are there to do <br/>\ntheir research, and oh, they have to teach a pesky class to get their <br/>\npay.  It was a real awakening, because they certainly had no desire <br/>\nto teach.  You basically had to teach yourself.  Boy did I suck at <br/>\nthat.  (Physics and differential equations are kinda hard things to <br/>\nstart self-learning.)  So I knew then and there that any child of <br/>\nmine would not be so dependent upon being spoon-fed information.<br/>\n<br/>\nFast-forward to the A Beka months.  Can you say spoon-fed with a <br/>\nvengeance?  My daughter craves being &quot;taught.&quot;  She loves it.  I love <br/>\nteaching her.  And that is why I choose to unschool.  Life is not <br/>\nabout being spoon-fed.  You don&#39;t find the best things in life until <br/>\nyou pick up your plate and lick it.

I was wondering how true this is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was thinking about the way I learned, and I was a verbal/linguistic <br/>\n&gt; learner with just enough logical/mathematical ability to do well in <br/>\n&gt; school.  For me, reading is the key to learning.  I always broke out <br/>\n&gt; in hives when I had a teacher who preferred to have us work in groups <br/>\n&gt; or do projects or play games.  I just wanted to read the book and <br/>\n&gt; take the test and that&#39;s that.  Even in college, I did well in <br/>\n&gt; the &quot;lecture&quot; portion of science classes but I was such an idiot in <br/>\n&gt; labs that one T.A. forgot his English and started screaming at me in <br/>\n&gt; Chinese.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I knew I wanted to homeschool before I had kids, and I assumed it <br/>\n&gt; would be all the things I loved about school -- lots of books and <br/>\n&gt; workbooks (I even bought workbooks for K-6 and kept them in a box <br/>\n&gt; until finally the last time we moved I threw them in a dumpster).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My son had his own reality.  I had all the books about child <br/>\n&gt; development and I made charts on the computer and printed them out <br/>\n&gt; for my binder.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, he didn&#39;t do anything according to the schedule of child <br/>\n&gt; development.  He didn&#39;t walk &quot;on time,&quot; or talk &quot;on time,&quot; or use the <br/>\n&gt; potty &quot;on time.&quot;  Meanwhile, he was exploring his environment and <br/>\n&gt; coming up with all kinds of great stuff that wasn&#39;t even on the <br/>\n&gt; charts.  He was about two when I threw away the books and charts (and <br/>\n&gt; that was before I even knew how late he&#39;d actually talk or use the <br/>\n&gt; potty).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So because of the clash between his learning style and mine, I was <br/>\n&gt; forced to explore multiple intelligences and unschooling.  But I <br/>\n&gt; wonder ... if he was more like me, maybe I&#39;d be one of the Well-<br/>\n&gt; Trained Mind parents, or Charlotte Mason (that&#39;s the kind of <br/>\n&gt; education I wish I&#39;d had!).  If I was homeschooled, I&#39;d want my <br/>\n&gt; parents to give me a huge stack of books and send me to my room.  My <br/>\n&gt; son would be devastated if he had to spend time in a room by himself <br/>\n&gt; every day.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have any insight into this?

I remembered the story but I didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; most <br/>\nof it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI did the same with Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Fin. I am enjoying them much more as an adult than I ever did as a kid. The fun thing is that the copy I have was my husband&#39;s from school and he had to underline all the &quot;hard words&#39;. Some of those words are never used today - and others kind of grew on you as you heard them used them in everyday life.  I would venture to say that he didn&#39;t learn that vocabulary from school!  My 8 year old enjoys the read aloud but I don&#39;t think she would pick it up herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nI went through a Danielle Steele - Trashy Romance Novel phase when I was in High School.  I wouldn&#39;t enjoy those books now as I don&#39;t find them &quot;good&quot; writing any longer.  Not that they were good writing then either ;-) But I just finished Lovely Bones and loved it!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case - we do enjoy many things that are considered classic literature - however we do read our share of Calvin & Hobbes and Captain Underpants. ( I hate these - but my children love them - luckily for them my husband finds them funny...) and my 5 year old is way into any kind of non-fiction regarding construction, building, and robots. I think we have completely exhausted the library supply of these!<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried following a unit study approach 2 years ago. It was Life in America - based on US History. They had a rather extensive list of books to read - drawing a lot from the American Girl books. We found we would get off on a tangent and just sit and read the whole book - rather than read the 2 chapters that were suggested and do the activity. It finally came down to my daughter really just not having any interest in  the revolutionary war. So from that point we just stopped. She now  loves the show Liberty&#39;s Kids - but I think the curriculum approach got kind of dry. The American Girl books were fun- I thought the whole set -up of this curriculum was cool- but found myself falling into the structure of having to complete the next lesson on guns - even if she hated it! I then realized this wasn&#39;t learning! <br/>\n<br/>\nI read the Well Trained Mind as well and really thought it sounded wonderful. Some of the ideas from the book have been  incorporated into life. We have the book &#39;English from the Roots Up&quot; and write a root word on our wipe off board once a week. We also like the game Rummy Roots.  - but this is fun! The overall structure of the approach was rather daunting to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlotte Mason placed a lot of emphasis on nature as well - and that has played a lot into our day. We have been actively bird watching. I have been writing down the types of birds we see in the back of my bird book. My 5y ds now writes birds down as well. It will take him so long to write &#39;Blue Jay&#39; but he really wants to do this! He walks around with a clipboard and asks how to spell things. He doesn&#39;t get all the letters correct - but I am finding it so exciting to see him learning - without any phonics lessons, or workbooks etc.  but because he feels a need to write down whatever he finds important.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo overall, I can see how some of the ideas in these books are good ones - I also can&#39;t see us following anything like this structurally because it creates too much stress - and then when life happens -or interests change - it just doesn&#39;t work - at least for us. Maybe others have found it to be different -<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: sorcha_aisling <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, May 06, 2003 11:31 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Learning styles and homeschooling methods (long)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Heather,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I read a lot of Stephen King when I was in school too.

I was wondering how true this is.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was thinking about the way I learned, and I was a verbal/linguistic <br/>\n  learner with just enough logical/mathematical ability to do well in <br/>\n  school.  For me, reading is the key to learning.  I always broke out <br/>\n  in hives when I had a teacher who preferred to have us work in groups <br/>\n  or do projects or play games.  I just wanted to read the book and <br/>\n  take the test and that&#39;s that.  Even in college, I did well in <br/>\n  the &quot;lecture&quot; portion of science classes but I was such an idiot in <br/>\n  labs that one T.A. forgot his English and started screaming at me in <br/>\n  Chinese.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I knew I wanted to homeschool before I had kids, and I assumed it <br/>\n  would be all the things I loved about school -- lots of books and <br/>\n  workbooks (I even bought workbooks for K-6 and kept them in a box <br/>\n  until finally the last time we moved I threw them in a dumpster).<br/>\n<br/>\n  My son had his own reality.  I had all the books about child <br/>\n  development and I made charts on the computer and printed them out <br/>\n  for my binder.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, he didn&#39;t do anything according to the schedule of child <br/>\n  development.  He didn&#39;t walk &quot;on time&quot;, or talk &quot;on time&quot;, or use the <br/>\n  potty &quot;on time&quot;.  Meanwhile, he was exploring his environment and <br/>\n  coming up with all kinds of great stuff that wasn&#39;t even on the <br/>\n  charts.  He was about two when I threw away the books and charts (and <br/>\n  that was before I even knew how late he&#39;d actually talk or use the <br/>\n  potty).<br/>\n<br/>\n  So because of the clash between his learning style and mine, I was <br/>\n  forced to explore multiple intelligences and unschooling.  But I <br/>\n  wonder ... if he was more like me, maybe I&#39;d be one of the Well-<br/>\n  Trained Mind parents, or Charlotte Mason (that&#39;s the kind of <br/>\n  education I wish I&#39;d had!).  If I was homeschooled, I&#39;d want my <br/>\n  parents to give me a huge stack of books and send me to my room.  My <br/>\n  son would be devastated if he had to spend time in a room by himself <br/>\n  every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Does anyone have any insight into this?  Do we choose unschooling <br/>\n  because of our learning style or our child&#39;s learning style or <br/>\n  because it&#39;s &quot;right&quot;?  If you had a child who loves to read and do <br/>\n  workbooks, would you school at home instead?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorcha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I think we do need to have a teaching style<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that works best for our children, no matter what we would like to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; consider ourselves. Otherwise, they aren&#39;t learning as much as they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could be. And, I think all homeschooling families are a big mixture<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of styles, whether they know it or not. I&#39;m sure unschooling<br/>\n&gt; families<br/>\n&gt; &gt; still read books, and Well-Trained Mind or others still go on hands<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on field trips once in a while. The advantage to homeschooling, or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; maybe we should just call it homelearning, to suit everyone, is<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we can pick and choose what we like, what works for us, and what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t. I think those of us that were schooled traditionaly<br/>\n&gt; growing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up, feel that we need a style to call ourselves, so that we can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; better explain to others what we are doing. It is kinda difficult<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; explain to someone, &quot;well, sometimes we read books, and sometimes<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; watch the discovery channel, and then sometimes we just go out in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; back yard and dig for bugs&quot;. lol It&#39;s all learning, and our kids<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get all the knowledge and skills they need, one way or the other.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And, think about it, aren&#39;t we still learning? So, if they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it all from us, they&#39;ll learn it themselves. And, possibly, every<br/>\n&gt; &gt; year it will change, as our children change. I think little ones<br/>\n&gt; need<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a little more structure, to start out their learning, but as they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grow, and become more independant, they can go off on thier own<br/>\n&gt; more.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Basically, it all comes down to the fact that we need to just do<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; works for us, our own families. We don&#39;t have to be accountable to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyone but our kids.

If you had a child who loves to read and do<br/>\nworkbooks, would you school at home instead?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorcha&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* choose unschooling because it speaks to my heart.  Yes, I feel it *IS* <br/>\nthe &quot;right&quot; way!  However, I think it is the right way for children, not all <br/>\nparents.  I don&#39;t think many people are willing to commit to it deeply <br/>\nenough to allow it to happen.  I think there are parents who would love <br/>\nnothing more than for Kindergarten to start just to get a break.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow many children who, given the preferred circumstances (cooperative, <br/>\nrespectful, patient, loving parents), would balk at unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Nicholette is a workbook junkie.  She craves &quot;homework&quot; and begs for it <br/>\ndaily.  So, yes, we &#39;school at home&#39; with her.  I consider it unschooling <br/>\nbecause this is what SHE chooses.  I never ask her.  Her favorite store is a <br/>\nlocal homeschooling store.  She runs wild from aisle to aisle, grabbing <br/>\nanything and everything.  She pours through workooks, textbooks, kits, you <br/>\nname it.  We generally have to devote an entire day to it because she isn&#39;t <br/>\nreading fluently so she asks me to read her samples of each book to decide <br/>\nwhich she likes best.  Currently, she is using a mix of Oak Meadow, <br/>\nSingapore Math, Explode the Code and Getty Dubay Italics.  She wants me to <br/>\nread her the teacher manuals aloud, so I do.  She likes taking tests to see <br/>\nwhat she remembers.  She even asked me to buy gold stars to put on the pages <br/>\nshe completes.  She never asks me to grade them or anything, and I never <br/>\noffer to.  Her books are full of gold stars and she beams with pride each <br/>\ntime she opens them. &lt;bwg&gt;  I suspect this is influence from her ps friends <br/>\nand possibly our old ps and school at home days with her big sister.  Maybe <br/>\nit will pass, maybe it won&#39;t!<br/>\n<br/>\nHaleigh is a mix.  She will go months without picking up anything remotely <br/>\nrelated to curriculum then suddenly bring in a textbook and ask me what she <br/>\nshould do.  Because I don&#39;t want her to feel like I *expect* her to do <br/>\ntextbook work, I turn the question around and ask her what looks <br/>\ninteresting.  She always has an answer, so that&#39;s what I suggest!  Last <br/>\nweek, she was holed up in her room till the wee hours reading the first <br/>\nthree Harry Potter books for the first time.  It took her a little under <br/>\nfour days to read them all.  She hasn&#39;t read since.  &lt;g&gt;  This week, she has <br/>\nbeen on a cleaning spree, cleaning anything she can get her hands on.  Who <br/>\nknows what next week will bring...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, I think you can school at home and still be an unschooler.  <br/>\nPersonally, I believe it is the direction of the child that constitutes <br/>\nunschooling.  If you follow their lead, completely, you are allowing them to <br/>\nunfold in their own way, in their own time.  So many unschoolers get wrapped <br/>\nup in rejecting anything remotely related to public school.  Buzz words like <br/>\ncurriculum, lessons, and teaching scare them and send them in a defensive <br/>\nfrenzy.  Teaching a child how to bake bread is a lesson.  You&#39;re still <br/>\nteaching.  It&#39;s still a lesson.  Heck, even the recipe is your guiding <br/>\n&#39;curriculum&#39;!  Does that mean we should throw out baking bread because it <br/>\nsounds schoolish???  I wouldn&#39;t but you can answer that question for <br/>\nyourself......*you*, of course, being whomever *you* are...not pointing <br/>\nfingers &lt;g&gt;...<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139187074,"authorName":"MARK and JULIE SOLICH","from":"&quot;MARK and JULIE SOLICH&quot; &lt;mjsolich@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Learning styles and homeschooling methods (long)","postDate":"1052270536","msgId":67859,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNzkwMWMzMTQzNyQxOTZhZWFlMCQzNTFhMzJkMkBtYXJrPg==","referencesHeader":"PGI5OWZvcSsyMTg5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67850,"nextInTopic":67860,"prevInTime":67858,"nextInTime":67860,"topicId":67844,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I think we do need to have a teaching style \r<br/>\nthat works best for our children, no matter what we would like to \r<br/>\nconsider ourselves. Otherwise, they aren&#39;t learning as much as they \r<br/>\ncould be. And, I think all homeschooling families are a big mixture \r<br/>\nof styles, whether they know it or not. I&#39;m sure unschooling families \r<br/>\nstill read books, and Well-Trained Mind or others still go on hands \r<br/>\non field trips once in a while. The advantage to homeschooling, or \r<br/>\nmaybe we should just call it homelearning, to suit everyone, is that \r<br/>\nwe can pick and choose what we like, what works for us, and what \r<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t. I think those of us that were schooled traditionaly growing \r<br/>\nup, feel that we need a style to call ourselves, so that we can \r<br/>\nbetter explain to others what we are doing. It is kinda difficult to \r<br/>\nexplain to someone, &quot;well, sometimes we read books, and sometimes we \r<br/>\nwatch the discovery channel, and then sometimes we just go out in the \r<br/>\nback yard and dig for bugs&quot;. lol It&#39;s all learning, and our kids will \r<br/>\nget all the knowledge and skills they need, one way or the other. \r<br/>\nAnd, think about it, aren&#39;t we still learning? So, if they don&#39;t get \r<br/>\nit all from us, they&#39;ll learn it themselves. And, possibly, every \r<br/>\nyear it will change, as our children change. I think little ones need \r<br/>\na little more structure, to start out their learning, but as they \r<br/>\ngrow, and become more independant, they can go off on thier own more. \r<br/>\nBasically, it all comes down to the fact that we need to just do what \r<br/>\nworks for us, our own families. We don&#39;t have to be accountable to \r<br/>\nanyone but our kids. Learn from them, as they will learn from us, and \r<br/>\neveryone will be happy. :) \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nWow, as I re-read that I amazed myself! lol I am still trying to find \r<br/>\nmy &quot;style&quot; and methods, and I think I just did. I hope this all makes \r<br/>\nsense to everyone, and maybe even helps. \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nTammy\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;sorcha_aisling&quot; &lt;sorcha-\r<br/>\naisling@i...&gt; wrote:\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been pondering this ever since an argument broke out on \r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>another \r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; message group between some Well-Trained Mind homeschoolers and some \r<br/>\n&gt; unschoolers, and the last comment in the discussion was that we all \r<br/>\n&gt; choose our method based on a combination of our own learning styles \r<br/>\n&gt; and our children&#39;s learning styles.

I think we do need to have a teaching style <br/>\nthat works best for our children, no matter what we would like to <br/>\nconsider ourselves. Otherwise, they aren&#39;t learning as much as they <br/>\ncould be. And, I think all homeschooling families are a big mixture <br/>\nof styles, whether they know it or not. I&#39;m sure unschooling families <br/>\nstill read books, and Well-Trained Mind or others still go on hands <br/>\non field trips once in a while. The advantage to homeschooling, or <br/>\nmaybe we should just call it homelearning, to suit everyone, is that <br/>\nwe can pick and choose what we like, what works for us, and what <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t. I think those of us that were schooled traditionaly growing <br/>\nup, feel that we need a style to call ourselves, so that we can <br/>\nbetter explain to others what we are doing. It is kinda difficult to <br/>\nexplain to someone, &quot;well, sometimes we read books, and sometimes we <br/>\nwatch the discovery channel, and then sometimes we just go out in the <br/>\nback yard and dig for bugs&quot;. lol It&#39;s all learning, and our kids will <br/>\nget all the knowledge and skills they need, one way or the other. <br/>\nAnd, think about it, aren&#39;t we still learning? So, if they don&#39;t get <br/>\nit all from us, they&#39;ll learn it themselves. And, possibly, every <br/>\nyear it will change, as our children change. I think little ones need <br/>\na little more structure, to start out their learning, but as they <br/>\ngrow, and become more independant, they can go off on thier own more. <br/>\nBasically, it all comes down to the fact that we need to just do what <br/>\nworks for us, our own families. We don&#39;t have to be accountable to <br/>\nanyone but our kids. Learn from them, as they will learn from us, and <br/>\neveryone will be happy. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nWow, as I re-read that I amazed myself! lol I am still trying to find <br/>\nmy &quot;style&quot; and methods, and I think I just did. I hope this all makes <br/>\nsense to everyone, and maybe even helps. <br/>\n<br/>\nTammy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;sorcha_aisling&quot; &lt;sorcha-<br/>\naisling@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been pondering this ever since an argument broke out on <br/>\n </span></blockquote>another <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; message group between some Well-Trained Mind homeschoolers and some <br/>\n&gt; unschoolers, and the last comment in the discussion was that we all <br/>\n&gt; choose our method based on a combination of our own learning styles <br/>\n&gt; and our children&#39;s learning styles.
