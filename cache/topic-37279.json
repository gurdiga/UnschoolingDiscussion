When he read Where the Red Fern Grows, he cried for <br/>\na couple days and said that book should be torn up. We took it out in the <br/>\nbackyard and burned it. Shilo upset him but not all that much.<br/>\n The main thing we look out for are Newberry Prize winners. I read Walk Two <br/>\nMoons. OH MY GAWD I cried for three days. I finished that book at night and <br/>\ncried and the next morning we went out to breakfast and I sat at the table <br/>\nand cried. Everyone you love dies in that book. IT WAS HORRIBLE. <br/>\n I do think that some kids are so sensitive and have so much humanity that <br/>\nthey cannot cope with great injustice or sad things until they are older. My <br/>\nson at almost 16 (I remember when Kirby was just 8!!! OH MY GAWD Sandra) can <br/>\nhandle anything now. He gets sad but he quit falling apart. <br/>\n My daughter was and still is not nearly as affected by things happening to <br/>\npeople but gets really upset by things happening to the environment. <br/>\n Ok I said some stuff, back to lurking....<br/>\n Beth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Homemade Volcanoes","postDate":"1022257223","msgId":37365,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDUyNDA5MTYxMC4wMjc3Y2M2MEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PGFjbGJvbSszMHB0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDNDRURDMzFFLjAwMDAwMS45NzMyNUBibGFsaT4="},"prevInTopic":37331,"nextInTopic":37447,"prevInTime":37364,"nextInTime":37366,"topicId":37279,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

How<br/>\n&gt; about Chaucer? I had an English Lit professor in high school call him<br/>\n&gt; the Larry Flint of his day!<br/>\n&gt; On to my question... Does anyone limit or restrict books their<br/>\n&gt; children read? I ask this because my Mom always kept a fairly good<br/>\n&gt; eye on what I read as a child.(until I was about 14 or so.)For<br/>\n&gt; example, when I was about 11 I wanted to read `The Thornbirds&#39; and<br/>\n&gt; when I was about 12 the book in question was Steven King&#39;s `It&#39;, and<br/>\n&gt; she wouldn&#39;t let me. She did explain what her reasons were any time<br/>\n&gt; she did this. Usually it was something like I know you can read the<br/>\n&gt; book, but I don&#39;t think at this time in your life you will understand<br/>\n&gt; the issues and themes in the book... or something like that. So far,<br/>\n&gt; I have not done anything like this to my children, but have been<br/>\n&gt; wondering what I would say if Moly (8) should come to me with one of<br/>\n&gt; my books and ask if she could read it. Then again, I don&#39;t see my<br/>\n&gt; child bringing one of my books and asking if she could read it. I see<br/>\n&gt; me finding her wrapped in a blanket on the couch half way through it!<br/>\n&gt; I guess it all boils down to, if you have an 8, 10, 12 year old with<br/>\n&gt; reading abilities far advanced, do you take into consideration their<br/>\n&gt; emotional advancement as well?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Nancy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
