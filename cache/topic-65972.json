The country had no choice, no say in Henry&#39;s decisions.<br/>\nCertainly, there were people around Henry that agreed w/ him. Follow the money, where did the land that was stolen go to? The land that was stolen was not just from the churches - common people had to change their faith or lose everything. I doubt the country was ready for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompare that - GWB&#39;s tax cuts.  Are we, as a nation ready for the upper 2% of this nation to pay less taxes while the lower income class loses Health, Education & Welfare benefits? Are we, as a nation ready to roll back environmental laws in order for multi-national companies to get more profit?<br/>\nNo. We are not.<br/>\nWhat can we do?<br/>\nThe common folks, the workers in the fields, the monks and the people they worked with, the inn-keepers and the blacksmiths - did these people want to change their faith - because Henry wanted a divorce?<br/>\nYes, the Church of Rome was corrupt. <br/>\nToday there are many scandals going on in the Catholic Church - still - for the most part - you don&#39;t have Catholics saying they want to leave the church.<br/>\nI have a feeling it was the same back then.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead the journals & papers - there was much resistance to this.<br/>\nHowever, who was going to disagree?<br/>\nthe common people - just trying to get through -day to day??<br/>\nWhether the &quot;country was ready is a question that is moot. He had absolute power. It simply didn&#39;t matter to him. Anyone w/ power - enough power to cause a problem was bought off. All the land that the Catholic church owned - became the property of the crown or Henry&#39;s loyal royals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not passing judgement on whether or not it was good for England.<br/>\nJust talking about history.<br/>\n<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Peggy <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, April 26, 2003 8:04 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 3355<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Message: 19<br/>\n  &gt;    Date: Sat, 26 Apr 2003 19:25:34 -0400<br/>\n  &gt;    From: &quot;coyote&#39;s corner&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jana@...\">jana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Subject: Re: Goodbyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Very true about Henry VIII and the founding of the CoE.
