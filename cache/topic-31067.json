I&#39;m changing my ways and instead of having this huge<br/>\nlibrary here at home with tons of bookshelves all over and boxes of<br/>\nbooks in the garage, I&#39;ve been posting and selling at half.com and ebay<br/>\nand using the public library.  I&#39;d be happy to add some books to the<br/>\nunschooling lending library.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first idea is that I could list available books and anyone interested<br/>\ncould send me their address (offlist).  Then I&#39;d send that request list<br/>\nalong with the book to the first person who requests it.  Future<br/>\nrequests could be sent via email to the person who currently has the<br/>\nbook.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe someone can think of a more clever way.  An online request list<br/>\nwithout addresses?  Posted at yahoo?  That might be better.  I played<br/>\naround a little there and made a test file.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt costs $1.33 for the first pound, which is most books, sent via media<br/>\nmail.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else interested?  Ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nCarolyn<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  I haven&#39;t bought the books either because they are REALLY pricey!<br/>\n&gt; maybe we<br/>\n&gt; should all start a book go round and collectively buy some of these<br/>\n&gt; books or<br/>\n&gt; start a lending library of sorts.
