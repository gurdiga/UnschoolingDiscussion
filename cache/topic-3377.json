One year, my oldest threw a <br/>\ntemper tantrum in the store on Christmas Eve. He got out of the tub, and got <br/>\na note from the elves.

Ds was great for the rest of the night and the elves left <br/>\njammas on his pillow.<br/>\n    We read &quot;&#39;Twas The Night Before Christmas&quot; every year just before bed. We <br/>\nget a mug of cocoa and sit together and read the story. This year I am <br/>\nsending a tape down to my Dad and asking him to read it on tape.

Even <br/>\nif that means just pulling out everyone&#39;s santa/snowman/tree mugs to sip hot <br/>\nchocolate from.

I live in the North Pole!!! North Pole, Alaska... exactly 4<br/>\nmiles from Santa Claus! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in a family that made a *very* big deal about Christmas (and<br/>\nbirthdays, and Thanksgiving, and... and....)  My husband, on the other hand,<br/>\ngrew up not celebrating *any* holidays!  I&#39;m sure many of you can imagine<br/>\nthe &quot;struggles&quot; we&#39;ve had, trying to merge his ideas and mine around<br/>\nholidays...   My husband&#39;s point (and I think it&#39;s a valid one), is that<br/>\nmost of us celebrate &quot;big time&quot; on holidays and birthdays, and basically<br/>\nignore our &quot;extended family&quot; and &quot;friends&quot; on other days.  In our family, we<br/>\ntry to get together and enjoy each others&#39; company on &quot;regular&quot; days...<br/>\nbuying (and/or making) gifts and giving them on &quot;normal&quot; days, too... You<br/>\nknow, the same idea as sending a long-lost friend a &quot;Thinking of You&quot; card<br/>\nout of the blue, just cuz ya miss her...<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate... at Christmas-time, we&#39;ve &quot;run the gammut&quot; from all-out huge<br/>\nfamily gatheringsgourmet meals & fancy clothes in previous years, to last<br/>\nyear -- it was just my husband, my kids, and me... stayed in jammies **ALL<br/>\nDAY** didn&#39;t answer the door or the telephone, watched football, read,<br/>\nopened our (very few) gifts... enjoyed each others&#39; company... etc... it was<br/>\ntruly blissful, relaxing, and stress-free.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year, we&#39;ll likely be in our new home (it&#39;s not really new... ya&#39;ll can<br/>\ncheck it out on the web at www.universalminds.com/dreams ), which will be<br/>\npresent enough... All our extra $$$ is going into fixing that place to make<br/>\nit livable (mortgage-free.... YES!!!!!!!!!!!).  I plan on making gifts with<br/>\nthe kids, watching Christmas movies & listening to Christmas music...<br/>\nenjoying the festivities around us...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have special traditions for Christmas that are free or inexpensive<br/>\nthey&#39;d like to share?<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Santa always leaves an orange in our stockings for good luck<br/>\n2)  Gram always wraps one present in Sunday comics<br/>\n3)  I watch Sound of Music *every year* (and sing along, of course....)<br/>\n4)  I call my parents (who each have new spouses who don&#39;t like this ritual)<br/>\neach year at 5am (that&#39;s what time I used to wake them up as a kid, and<br/>\nsince I&#39;m still their kid, I still &quot;bug them&quot; on Christmas morning &lt;gggg&gt;)<br/>\n5)  I give each of my children 2 books... one I think they&#39;ll enjoy, and one<br/>\n&quot;Christmas&quot; book to add to their collection for their own homes<br/>\n6) Each child gets an ornament that in some way ties in to the theme of<br/>\ntheir book...  For example, last year, Zac receive the book &quot;The Three<br/>\nTrees&quot; and received a pine tree ornament. (check your local used bookstore<br/>\nfor great finds on books...)<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, we now have snow here...

They probably wouldn&#39;t care a bit.  They<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t notice I don&#39;t think.<br/>\nLast year instead of buying gifts for all the cousins, we make a book<br/>\nfor them.  Each one of my kids had a page.  They picked something they<br/>\nwanted to tell their cousins and extended family about themselves.    My<br/>\nsister, sister in law and cousin all agreed we would do this instead of<br/>\npresents as a way to bring our families closer.  We would send them<br/>\nbefore Christmas to be put under the tree and shared on Christmas<br/>\nmorning.  We were  the only ones that actually did it, and before<br/>\nChristmas.  We never received one from my sisters kids at all.  This yr.<br/>\nI&#39;m just going to do whatever we decide, and not think about anyone<br/>\nelse.<br/>\nWe, in the last couple of years, have also eliminated the big dinner.<br/>\nSince I do it at Thanksgiving, it was kind of a bummer to have to take<br/>\npart of our special family day and cook, set the table ect....
