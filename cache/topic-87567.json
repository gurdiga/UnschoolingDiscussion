Now that I&#39;m not pregnant, I&#39;ve begun teaching her some things that I know. Signups for next year&#39;s PopWarner are in March so we&#39;re planning to sign her up, and enroll her in a gymnastics class for tumbling here shortly as well. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;ve both benefitted greatly from my sharing these interests with her. <br/>\n <br/>\nAt Christmas time, a friend gave us a huge 7ft tree. Paul took out his small axe to cut it down some with. His friend Josh was here and as guys do they got to bragging and Paul said he could take it and plant it in that tree over there...and Josh said &quot;Do it.&quot; so he did. Logan thought it was the coolest thing, and listen with eyes wide as Paul talked about throwing knives too. Josh took out one of his knives and Paul threw it at a mark he made on the tree. Then they got to talking about archery and deer hunting with bows...The looks on Logan&#39;s face were priceless..full of awe and wonder....<br/>\n <br/>\nI know the two of them...and Paul has said the girls as well if they become interested..will have plenty to keep them busy as he gets older. We&#39;ve promised Logan his own fishing rod/reel for this spring to go along with the one that I won for Paul in a raffle just before Christmas. <br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mattamandab@...\">Mattamandab@...</a> wrote:<br/>\nCongratulations on your new baton!
