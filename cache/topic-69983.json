We are still pondering the &quot;what if something happens to the <br/>\nboth of us&quot; question, with little in the way of answers yet.  But we both <br/>\ncame to the conclusion that we need to be looking at family that does not <br/>\nhave children.  My best friend and my niece are two that we are talking <br/>\nabout.  All of our family that have children are so set in how children need <br/>\nto be raised, all of them have such a disrespectful attitude toward children. <br/>\n Totally believe that children need to be &quot;filled up&quot; with knowledge, have no <br/>\nindependent thought, should not be part of conversations and decision making, <br/>\netc., etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of family members with no children do not seem to have that mind set <br/>\nand would be more open to discussing alternative thinking.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe it has nothing to do with children, maybe it is just my family.  <br/>\nThey do not seem to be the type to question societies &quot;normals&quot;.  &quot;It has <br/>\nalways been done like this&quot; is good enough for them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts.<br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] friends, was peace and ....","postDate":"1053382032","msgId":70002,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwNTE5LjE2MDcxMy4xNjQ0LjcuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":69992,"nextInTopic":70016,"prevInTime":70001,"nextInTime":70003,"topicId":69983,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***We have several childless couples and singles who REALLY *get* unschooling---the lifestyle and everything.
