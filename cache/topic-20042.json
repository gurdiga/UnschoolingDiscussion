Although a number of<br/>\ndevelopments in the 20th century forshadowed the Public<br/>\nFamily--especially the Public Education System and<br/>\nwidespread daycare--it was really the economic changes<br/>\nsurrounding the Second Energy Crisis of 2010-2013 that<br/>\ncaused a cascade of events, in which it is possible to<br/>\ndiscern the true rise of the Public Family.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarly in the century, a series of rolling blackouts<br/>\nforced businesses to move to a 3 shift, 24-hour<br/>\neconomic model. Many families with two wage earners<br/>\nfound husband and wife both working at night. No<br/>\nlonger able to work, sleep, *and* care for their<br/>\nchildren, many families turned to the burgeoning<br/>\nNightcare industry to provide parenting expertise. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Parental authority&quot;, already undermined by public<br/>\neducation and displaced by the public servants<br/>\n(educators and advertisers) who managed the child&#39;s<br/>\npeer group, was joined by &quot;parental affection&quot;, which<br/>\nwas now confined to a few hours of visitation a week.<br/>\nThe interest of children in their biological parents<br/>\nchanged to fit the societal realities of their lives.<br/>\nAlthough the &quot;Family&quot; lived on in public mythology, the<br/>\nreality was that approximately one-third of a whole<br/>\ngeneration of children grew up who had been raised<br/>\nalmost entirely by public servants.<br/>\n<br/>\nA two-tiered economic system developed, in which middle<br/>\nclass couples worked two jobs in order to pay for<br/>\nprivate daycare, education, and nightcare, while poorer<br/>\nfamilies managed as they always had, using an informal<br/>\nnetwork of family and friends to get by less and less<br/>\nwell--with occasional tragedies involving children<br/>\nconfined to their cribs and left alone by desperate parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the 2020s, a series of crises transformed the<br/>\nemerging Public Family system. A wave of hysteria<br/>\nfollowed the highly publicized case of a child<br/>\naffectionately known to millions as &quot;Baby Theresa&quot;.<br/>\nBaby Theresa&#39;s biological single mother worked two<br/>\nshifts and the third as a hooker to pay for their<br/>\none-room apartment and to support her amphetimine<br/>\nhabit. The Energy Independence Act of 2015 had already<br/>\nintroduced government-subsidies for Nightcare. In the<br/>\nBaby Theresa case, the combined public fears of<br/>\nwidespread addiction to amphetimines among workers and<br/>\na fear of unfit mothers led to the legal placement of<br/>\nBaby Theresa and other children in the government<br/>\nsystem, and the establishment of &quot;parental standards&quot;<br/>\ncomparable to those in effect in the government-<br/>\nregulated Nightcare/Daycare industry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the 2020s and early 2030s, government<br/>\nregulation increased for both Public and Private<br/>\nFamilies. Richer families employed new categories of<br/>\nprofessionals such as parent-evaluators alongside the<br/>\nlong list of tax accountants, lawyers, teachers,<br/>\ndoctors, and so forth already needed to run a household<br/>\nand raise children. The burden of raising a Private<br/>\nFamily and demostrating compliance with parental<br/>\nstandards increased so that the practice began to<br/>\ndecline. Wherever private parents met, jokes about the<br/>\nhorrors of &quot;portfolio audits&quot; were exchanged.<br/>\nEnthusiastic private parents joined their local Parent-<br/>\nGovernment Partnership Program (PGPPs).<br/>\n<br/>\nPrivate Families still continued to be common among<br/>\nsome conservative Catholics and the more radical<br/>\nProtestant churches. But mainstream churches, by and<br/>\nlarge, tended to support pro-Family policies. These<br/>\nchurches had long been effectively arms of the<br/>\ngovernment, as they administered the charity programs,<br/>\npastoral care programs, and church-run<br/>\nDaycare/Nightcare centers needed to support three-shift<br/>\nworking families. These programs, administered by the<br/>\nDepartment of Faiths, provided government matching<br/>\nfunds to churches that complied with government<br/>\nguidelines on hiring practices, inclusivity standards,<br/>\nrevised their scriptures and teaching to be compliant<br/>\nwith hate-suppression guidelines, and had a certified<br/>\npro-family policy.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the troubled 2030s, &quot;The Great Rollback&quot;, social<br/>\ntensions increased alongside agitation for expanding<br/>\nthe Public Family System. President Al Bush-Kennedy (a<br/>\nscion of several famous political families) and his<br/>\nwife &quot;Tupper Bird&quot; were the first husband/wife team to<br/>\nserve four consecutive terms from 2033-2048. During the<br/>\nthird Bush-Kennedy administration, their comprehensive<br/>\nsocial program, called &quot;The New Cradle,&quot; finally made<br/>\nthe advantages of the Public Family System available to<br/>\nall, whether economically disadvantaged or not. <br/>\n<br/>\nOrphanages, Juvenile Delinquent homes, &quot;Totalcare<br/>\nCenters&quot; (Daycare/Nightcare/School/Hospital/Nursing<br/>\nHome), were all merged and rationalized in a single<br/>\nadministration, The Department of Family. The Family<br/>\nSecurity Tax was introduced to allow all workers to<br/>\ncontribute to the support of children. In return, the<br/>\ngovernment sent parents pictures and letters from<br/>\n&quot;their&quot; children. Parents could apply to the Department<br/>\nof Family to receive children matching their<br/>\nspecifications as closely as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe New Cradle required bypassing the opposition of the<br/>\nnow discredited U.S. Supreme Court, where a cadre of<br/>\nconservative justices tried to block the new pro-Family<br/>\nReforms. But, as supporters of the New Cradle pointed<br/>\nout, a legal system based on Common Law was inherently<br/>\nAnti-Family, so it could hardly be expected to reform<br/>\nitself. The U.S. Constitution was amended so that a<br/>\ntwo-thirds majority of both Houses, with the<br/>\nconcurrence of the co-Presidents, could override any<br/>\ncourt decision. These years also saw the demise of the<br/>\nhated Electoral College system, and the integration of<br/>\n&quot;Local&quot; and &quot;State&quot; governments and their respective<br/>\ncourts into departments of the Federal government. The<br/>\nreduced waste and redundancy greatly improved the<br/>\nefficiency of governing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the Great Rollback and Second Gulf War that<br/>\nfollowed it, it became commonplace for spouses to work<br/>\nin different parts of the country.  Competing in a<br/>\nglobal economy was tough, but America rose to the<br/>\noccasion by creating the most mobile economy in the<br/>\nworld.  Without children, parents could work anywhere,<br/>\nanytime.  The 2050s are looked on as a sort of Golden<br/>\nAge, in which happy Public Families worked hard and<br/>\npatriotically to make American Corporations once again<br/>\nthe most profitable in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut behind the glowing happy faces in the holo-movies,<br/>\ntrouble was brewing.  Spouses who never saw each other<br/>\nand had no children were beginning to doubt their<br/>\nidentification with the social values and constructs<br/>\nknown as &quot;parenting&quot;.  For at least a generation,<br/>\nthe primary relationship between spouses had been over<br/>\nthe Net.  One of the key reforms of The New Cradle had<br/>\nbeen 20 minute conjugal breaks for life-partners who<br/>\nhad not seen each other in at least 7 days due to work<br/>\nschedules, both of whom were employed by companies with over<br/>\n50 workers.  (Conjugal breaks were not conducted in<br/>\nperson, of course.  Sex in person was no longer the<br/>\nnorm, as most persons used Personal Companion Devices<br/>\n[PCDs] connected to the Net.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe suicide rate, hidden drug addiction, and<br/>\npsychological disorders were symptoms of a deeper<br/>\nunderlying problem--the self-image of Parenthood<br/>\nimposed by society on its members. After a series of<br/>\npowerful books, such as _The Parental Mystique_ and<br/>\n_Silent Crib_, the Parent Liberation Movement was born.<br/>\nBonding Partners were to let go of the confining social<br/>\nroles implied by an unattainable ideal of parenthood.<br/>\nThe movement stressed that Parenthood was not an ideal,<br/>\nbut a trap that denied the essential personal autonomy<br/>\nof the partner, and insisted on an unfair, unattainable<br/>\nrole model of self-sacrifice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2060s saw a number of countercultural movements.<br/>\nThe &quot;Back to Bed&quot; movement, commonly known as &quot;The<br/>\nHumpers,&quot; attempted to re-introduce same-place sex.<br/>\nAlthough they added a certain ambiance to the decade,<br/>\nthe Humpers had little impact in the long run, as their<br/>\nideals were impractical and two-parent child rearing<br/>\ndid not leave enough time to earn the income to make it<br/>\nfeasible. Few corporations were prepared to hire<br/>\nworkers who wished to remain together, or who were<br/>\nunavailable on demand because they were raising<br/>\nchildren in their spare time. The Humpers did, however,<br/>\ndevelop an underground network of mid-Nannies to assist<br/>\nin homeparenting, and also The Semen League to assist<br/>\nwith artificial insemination for parents who were<br/>\nforced to return to work in separate cities before<br/>\nstarting their families.<br/>\n<br/>\nA more enduring impact of the 2060s came from the<br/>\nnon-violent Family Rights movement, which addressed the<br/>\ninequalities between the Public Family System and the<br/>\nPrivate Family System. The triumphal &quot;Great War on<br/>\nElitism&quot; was eventually followed, in the 2070s, by<br/>\nAffirmative Parenthood, in which the remaining private<br/>\nfamilies (the richest 10% of the population) were<br/>\nobliged to send some of their children to the Public<br/>\nFamily System, unless they agreed to forgo the Governement<br/>\nsubsidies for Private Families. Most private families<br/>\nwho could chose to pay the Family Security Tax and<br/>\nforgo the subsidies, but keep their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a result of the upheavals of the 2060s and 2070s, a<br/>\nnew movement begain to coalesce. At first it was<br/>\nlargely illegal, but slowly gaining support. The<br/>\n&quot;homefamily movement&quot; advocated &quot;taking back our kids&quot;<br/>\nand raising them in a parented home. Two rather<br/>\ndiverse groups pioneered the homefamily movement. On<br/>\nthe one hand there were religious fringe groups like<br/>\nNeo-Roman Catholics** and some extreme Protestants, who<br/>\nhad always covertly raised children, often while the<br/>\ngovernment turned a blind eye to the practice. The<br/>\nother group giving initial support to the homefamily<br/>\nmovement were leftovers from the &quot;Natural Family&quot;<br/>\nmovements of the 2060s. They were commonly derided as<br/>\n&quot;Kid Huggers&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n** To be distinguished from the more numerous and<br/>\ngovernment-approved American Catholics.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2080s are mostly remembered for the return of the<br/>\nPublic Family System to the private sector. Private<br/>\nenterprise has always been more effecient at raising<br/>\nchildren than the Government could be. After her<br/>\nlandslide victory in the election of 2080, President<br/>\nHunt-Rockefeller (&quot;The Great Liberator&quot;) started a<br/>\nprogram of privatized parenting. Corporations, which<br/>\nhad already contributed to the daycare and nightcare of<br/>\ninfants and ran the privatized &quot;public&quot; schools,<br/>\nbrought the efficiency of the marketplace to parenting.<br/>\nBiological parents received vouchers for their children<br/>\nallowing them to place the children in any corporate<br/>\nprogram they wished, provided the child met the<br/>\nstandards for and was accepted by that program.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe profound interest of private business in the<br/>\noutcome of childrearing--today&#39;s children are<br/>\ntomorrow&#39;s workers--guaranteed the best upbringing for<br/>\nall children. Companies were able to achieve<br/>\nunparalleled loyalty in the workplace, as well as<br/>\nefficient assignment to jobs. After all, with access to<br/>\nthe best testing technology and years worth of<br/>\ndocumentation for each potential worker, they could<br/>\nhardly make mistakes. A lively marketplace also<br/>\ndeveloped whereby companies could exchange workers in a<br/>\nfair and economically efficient way, for whatever the<br/>\nmarket would bear. This benefited both the workers, who<br/>\nwere placed in the job most fitting their talents, and<br/>\nthe company, which could manage cost reduction<br/>\nflexibly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we look forward to the 22nd century, from our<br/>\nvantage point in the late 2090s, a number of trends are<br/>\napparent. The natural trend of societal evolution<br/>\nsuggests that we have travelled from Public Education<br/>\nto Public Family. I would like to suggest that beyond<br/>\nthis lies an even more glorious system, the Public<br/>\nIndividual. In both the case of Public Education and<br/>\nthe Public Family, the government supplied the critical<br/>\nfirst steps, eventually turning the job over to the<br/>\nprivate sector. Public policy could be brought to bear<br/>\nso that harmful and dissident individuals, especially<br/>\nthose supporting the homefamily movement, could be<br/>\nreformed and made to support socially productive goals.<br/>\nClearly the government cannot stand idle and allow<br/>\ncertain individuals, who have no proper training and no<br/>\neconomic stake in the future worker, to continue to<br/>\nharm even one child and deprive industry of even one<br/>\nworker by raising them improperly in--God forbid--their<br/>\nown home.
