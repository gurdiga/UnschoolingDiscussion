They know what an anesthesia machine <br/>\n&gt;looks like and like to play with the pediatric gas masks.  They know how dh <br/>\n&gt;rubs those scented Lip Smackers on the inside of them so the kids smell <br/>\n&gt;something pleasant before they fall asleep (not our kids, his patients <br/>\n&gt;&lt;G&gt;).  Emily reads the labels on the anesthesia machine, so she knows about <br/>\n&gt;O2, N2O, and hospital air.  Our kids set up elaborate operating room <br/>\n&gt;tableaus at home on Noah&#39;s Little Tikes workshop bench.  I wish there was a <br/>\n&gt;way Emily could really *go* to work with Dad, though... she would love it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I have memories of going to work with my dad.  When I was in elementary <br/>\n&gt;school, he drilled wells and installed/fixed water softeners, pumps, etc.   <br/>\n&gt;I learned about muriatic acid watching him use it to clean parts.  Also <br/>\n&gt;learned a lot about hard/soft water.  Then when I was in high school, Dad <br/>\n&gt;opened his own floor covering store.  I learned some basic accounting and <br/>\n&gt;helped keep the books for the store.  I learned about pricing, profit, etc. <br/>\n&gt;  But the one thing I could NEVER learn, no matter how much my dad (with a <br/>\n&gt;6th grade &quot;education&quot;) tried to teach me.... was to figure &quot;cuts&quot;.  That&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;the term for figuring how much carpet to order when you have a room larger <br/>\n&gt;than the carpet width.  If the carpet is on a 12ft roll and the room is <br/>\n&gt;12x18, you can order 18 feet of carpet.  But if it is 15x16 and you have a <br/>\n&gt;12ft roll.... you have to order more than 16 ft to fill in the 3 feet along <br/>\n&gt;one side.  My poor brain was lousy at figuring that stuff.  I have noticed <br/>\n&gt;nowadays, many carpet stores aren&#39;t pricing by the sq. yard any more... I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt;not sure if that is to compensate for lousy math skills or what.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Karen<br/>\n&gt;   Mama to Emily (12/91), Noah (12/95), Halle (10/98), and Joel (9/00)<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/heartland/2358\">http://www.geocities.com/heartland/2358</a><br/>\n&gt;   mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:careermom@...\">careermom@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!
