My<br/>\nhusband could hardly spell when  I met him (he was 21) but he COULD<br/>\ncommunicate in writing very well.  He just  needed an editor.  Over the<br/>\nyears his spelling improved, slowly but surely,  because the pressure of<br/>\ngrades and school and red pencil marks as gone and he  came to care.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am really glad you wrote this. Yesterday my boys decided to color some<br/>\npictures of african animals. Jess brought his to me to glue into our<br/>\nyearbook and he had written a poem underneath the cheetah. (This is the<br/>\nfirst poem since we began unschooling!) Here it is.

If he had<br/>\nwritten it at school and had been made to go back and correct it, I wonder<br/>\nif he would ever try again. I didn&#39;t say anything about the spelling, just<br/>\nglued it into the book and told him I really liked the poem. I&#39;ll just look<br/>\nout for opportunities to point out the spelling of those words without<br/>\nreferences to his poem.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Buy Ink Cartridges or Refill Kits for your HP, Epson, Canon or Lexmark<br/>\n&gt; Printer at MyInks.com.
