When I don t do something I want I don t beat myself down","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-217586014\">From Pat: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, I have embraced that I am &quot;trying my best <br/>\nand that is the best I can do&quot;. When I don&#39;t do something I want I <br/>\ndon&#39;t beat myself down mentally. I regroup and realize I can do it <br/>\ndifferently without the FEAR that I am failing. This constant FEAR is <br/>\na result of the painful consequences in my childhood that I was <br/>\nunable to escape then. These consequences are gone now, choose your <br/>\npriorities. For some, the best that they can do is not to hit their <br/>\nchildren. For others, the children can thrive on so much more when a <br/>\nparent isn&#39;t trying to overcome so much themselves. Be gentle with <br/>\nyourself. <br/>\nHow can one play when one is on the verge of failing, IN HER OWN <br/>\nMIND? You can not do it all perfectly. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was WONDERFUL! Thank you so much for saying exactly what *I* <br/>\nneed to hear :)  My MIL was just here and I was putting on my <br/>\n*Supermom* act and shoving my children into the *model grandchildren* <br/>\nroles.  It&#39;s no surprise that we only lasted 4 days til the first <br/>\nrebellion against my micro-management!  When MIL not-so-gently-<br/>\nsuggested I use spanking to deal with Hayden, I realized the whole <br/>\n*being what she wants to see* experiment was a failure; she wasn&#39;t <br/>\nseeing her grandchildren as the whole and wonderful people they are.  <br/>\nWell, it was really her grandSON she didn&#39;t see that way; Hannah&#39;s <br/>\nincredibly adaptable and social, Hayden requires a lot more loving <br/>\npatience.  My kids are her *only* grandkids, I&#39;ve now put the <br/>\nresponsibility of getting to know them back onto HER.  If she only <br/>\nsees them once every 18 months and expects perfect *restaurant* <br/>\nbehavior from them at all times, then SHE&#39;s the one missing the <br/>\nboat.  I will never again coerce my children into being who they are <br/>\nnot to make someone else comfortable.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~diana, Queen of Everything and a damnned good mama to Hannah, <br/>\nPrincess of Quite-a-lot and Hayden, Prince of Whatever&#39;s Left.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There never was a good war or a bad peace&quot; -Jones soda bottle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97202,"nextTopicId":97208}}
