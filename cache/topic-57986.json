So many!  I&#39;ve participated in a few of them,<br/>\nthe nice part is since there are so many of them I get to be picky about<br/>\nwhich ones I&#39;ll put my stuff in (mostly my stuff is in a local bookstore<br/>\nright now).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is also a sandcastle building contest on the beaches here<br/>\n(or maybe that was  in the north bay - I can&#39;t remember right now).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if you ever make back out here, feel free to call (we have an<br/>\nextra futon!).<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\non the central coast where the sun is shining and the temperature is at<br/>\nleast 70.  Beach weather!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57981,"nextTopicId":57939}}
