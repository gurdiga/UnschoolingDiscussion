I&#39;m serious.  She saw it as something social, and efficient (to <br/>\nhave all that stuff in one place and do more than one load at a time).  I saw <br/>\nit as something for people who can&#39;t afford a washing machine, and I kept <br/>\nbeing reminded of the ghostly little girl in me whose mom made us be still, <br/>\nsit down, be quiet at the public laundry when I was a kid (which is still <br/>\nthere, in a half a quanset hut stuck on another building, in my home town.
