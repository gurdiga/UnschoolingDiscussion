I have 2 vegan DD&#39;s, they have been vegan for 2 years now.  The rest of us won&#39;t eat anything from a cow (also for 2 years)  It has been a learning experience for us all.  At first I didn&#39;t know what I would make for them to eat, but trial and error (a lot like homeschooling) has made it work.  It took a lot of reading to learn what could be eaten and where to find it.  For the first month the girls didn&#39;t like a lot of the things that they now eat, I think they had to go through a detox  before they could readjust their taste preference.  If you want to become vegan/vegetarian give it time and retry things you may find you like it after all. <br/>\n<br/>\nSheryl<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;do not meddle with the affairs of dragons, for you are crunchy and good <br/>\nwith ketchup.&quot;  annon.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Speaking the Truth in times of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.&quot; George Orwell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109873,"nextTopicId":109956}}
