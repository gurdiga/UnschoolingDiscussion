I really like anything on Permaculture.  <br/>\nI did have the huge Permaculture Manual by Bill Mollison, but it was like a <br/>\nscience textbook and I could never get past the first chapters.  So I sold it <br/>\nand got, instead, the Introduction to Permaculture book which is much more user <br/>\nfriendly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy hands were feeling great for about 3 days, then I started going through <br/>\nfiles, shelves, drawers, etc doing some heavy duty decluttering, and they&#39;re <br/>\nitching again.  I&#39;m thinking it might have to do with all the ink and chemicals <br/>\non the papers.  Still, it&#39;s nothing like it had been.  I was well on my way to <br/>\nending up like I did last summer at the beginning of this week and knew I had <br/>\nto do something.

My dh had eczema on his feet as well when he had it as a child and when he would eat really badly as an adult.  That must be horrible.  I know salt water helps as well.  I hope you are able to find a homeopathic Dr.  My MIL does consultations with people all over the world by phone if you can&#39;t find anyone there.  E-mail me privately.

Although I didn&#39;t <br/>\nstart the thread on eczema/food allergies/healthy eating, I have loved it and <br/>\nlearned so much.  And at least for me, it is VERY unschooling related.  My <br/>\nhands (last summer) got so bad I had to go for days doing nothing...couldn&#39;t <br/>\ngarden, cook (any food made my hands burn) shower,...even holding a book would make <br/>\nthem itch.  Forget rubbing a kid&#39;s back or my husband&#39;s...and I was just <br/>\nplain miserable.  I&#39;d like to talk even more with you about your transition.  It <br/>\nsounds like something I really need.  We have a small farm and grow a LOT of <br/>\nour own food with absolutely no pesticides/herbacides at all.  It takes a long <br/>\ntime, but I just pick bugs and bug eggs off the plants, and let the chickens <br/>\nrun through the garden once a week or so for about an hour and pick bugs and <br/>\nweeds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am into day 3 of no milk, no wheat, no tomatoes, no strawberries, no eggs, <br/>\nno soy,...when I get ready to eat something I think whether it was mentioned <br/>\nas an allergen and avoid it.  I have had to shear sheep though, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink that (wool and lanolin) bothers me because for the past 3 days or so my <br/>\nhands seem to be healing and are so soft.  Probably the only think I can&#39;t avoid <br/>\nis dust/dust mites.  Our house is INCREDIBLY dusty (open walls, we&#39;re doing <br/>\nconstruction) but I&#39;ve had this eczema forever (as a kid I had it terribly on my <br/>\nfeet) and never before now lived in an extremely dusty house. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for sharing your story.
