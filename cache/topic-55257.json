Whixh is why my typing is so &gt;terrible half the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I was just kidding about the sewing, sort of. Pants with zippers and<br/>\npockets are about the worst things to sew - very complicated. Much easier to<br/>\nbuy - if you can just find the right size. I have a lot of luck for myself<br/>\nbuying at Ross - they usually have pants that fit for a great price, too!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Mind you, no huge loss.

That must be tough to deal with. Have you<br/>\nseen the movie Lorenzo&#39;s Oil with Nick Nolte in it? Excellent movie! It&#39;s a<br/>\ntrue story about a boy who was diagnosed with an MS-type of disease. I<br/>\nremember really liking it, although I cried a few times! Even my boys liked<br/>\nit and were glued to the set while it was on. Don&#39;t worry - it has a good<br/>\nending. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94797851,"authorName":"Karin","from":"&quot;Karin&quot; &lt;curtkar@...&gt;","profile":"kc85022","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] tall and skinny","postDate":"1042679360","msgId":55257,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2YwMWMyYmNmYiRlNjk0N2Y2MCQ2NDAwYThjMEBnb2R6aWxsYT4=","referencesHeader":"PEYzMm16bVZCQ09XSEpWa2w0QVUwMDAxZTVmMkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDNFMjU2RTA2LkNCNkZDMTI1QHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":55264,"prevInTime":55256,"nextInTime":55258,"topicId":55257,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... the right length just slide right down, and if we get them so they fit her waist, they are flapping 3 inches above her ankles.
