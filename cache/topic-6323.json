I wasn&#39;t ignoring you, but have<br/>\nbeen thinking about it all this time (slow thinker :o) !) and asked my<br/>\noldest daughter about it.  She is the coordinator of our state inclusive<br/>\nhomeschooling organization, HERO (we have a really neat site and chat list--<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.oklahomahomeschooling.org\">http://www.oklahomahomeschooling.org</a>  Come visit!)  I was feeling kind of<br/>\nsilly because I couldn&#39;t really tell you what we did or how we did it, but I<br/>\nknow we did something!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Here is her response:  We weren&#39;t hooligans, and<br/>\nthere were family rules.  Being family rules, I mean each<br/>\nfamily has to decide what they will be and how many they need.  We had to<br/>\nclean house, keep good hygiene, etc. but we were left to do most of those<br/>\nwithin our own time schedule.  Julie.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd from me, Sandi, I will tell you that the kids pretty much felt like they<br/>\njust played all the time, but as<br/>\nthey have examined how they  go about homeschooling their own children, have<br/>\nrealized how very much learning was going on all the while.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy grandchildren range in age from 11 down to 8 months, 14 of them.  All but<br/>\ntwo are in homeschooling families, and those two are 2 and a half and 9<br/>\nmonths, so they may decide to down the road.  Julie&#39;s three boys are 9, 8,<br/>\nand 4.<br/>\nSandi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Did you let<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your kids schedule their time completely however they wanted to all day<br/>\n&gt; long<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or what type of rules if any did you have and enforce?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Beth the curious and grateful<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6077,"nextTopicId":6324}}
