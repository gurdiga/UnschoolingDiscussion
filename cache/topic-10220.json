Thats a tough one for me, <br/>\nas it doesn&#39;t seem to come up in my kids daily lives without my pushing it. <br/>\nI found it very easy when the kids were young-I remember asking &quot;How many <br/>\nplates would we need on the table if Aunt Christy were coming to dinner?&quot; <br/>\nand everyone knew fractions pretty well just because we were doing good to <br/>\nfind one measuring cup when we made cookies.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that they are older though, it is a little more unnerving to me. On one <br/>\nhand I think that I didn&#39;t understand algebra after taking it, and it hasn&#39;t <br/>\nhurt me, but on the other hand, will they be limited by not learning higher <br/>\nmath as children?<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA<br/>\n<br/>\nCathie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10085,"nextTopicId":10221}}
