I spoke with Leif a few days<br/>\nbefore and we both agreed that we could add little to the cacophony of voices<br/>\nremembering the events of one year prior. However,  I told Leif I wanted to<br/>\nbegin with a few words, though I didn&#39;t yet know what they would be.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the morning of the reading, I didn&#39;t go to work, but went, instead, to my<br/>\nboat. I meant to stay for a few minutes, but I ended up spending the entire<br/>\nday thinking and writing. I realized there was something very, very important<br/>\nbeing ignored. Something that had to be said, something that, on September 11,<br/>\n2002 would be difficult to say. This is what I said to the audience that<br/>\nnight:<br/>\n<br/>\nHi. Thank you all for coming. I&#39;m Morley Horder and my family and I own Eagle<br/>\nHarbor Book Co. I&#39;d like to begin this evening with a moment of silence...<br/>\n<br/>\nFreedom. Freedom of speech, of association, of religion. Freedom to think what<br/>\nwe want, to write and to publish what we want, to believe what we want, to say<br/>\nwhat we want, and, yes, to read what we want - in complete privacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nFreedom is a cornerstone of our America. Today, in a rapidly changing world,<br/>\nwhere fear has arrived in America, we face choices that may fundamentally<br/>\nchange our country forever: choices to limit personal freedom in the name of<br/>\npublic security. This is not the first time we have made such choices. Twenty<br/>\nyears ago, for example, we embraced airport security checks with little<br/>\ndebate. Recently, we have been told we may not board our local ferries if we<br/>\nare not willing to submit to random searches. Next, we may choose to give up<br/>\nthe right to cross our bridges or to enter our buildings without being<br/>\nchecked. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese decisions -- to limit our personal freedoms for the security of the<br/>\nwhole -- will be loudly debated, as they should be. We will clearly understand<br/>\nthe price we are paying in the loss of our personal freedom and feel the<br/>\nsecurity we gain in return.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat concerns me, however, are recent decisions made without significant<br/>\npublic debate, the unintended effects of which are not so easily measurable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose -- increased public security -- has been hailed, while the<br/>\nunintended result -- erosion of freedom -- has been largely ignored, or,<br/>\nperhaps, considered worth the cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example is the Patriot Act, passed in October 2001. The Patriot Act was<br/>\ncreated by good people for a good purpose: increased security for all<br/>\nAmericans.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder the Patriot Act, the FBI can obtain court orders to monitor anyone it<br/>\nthinks may have information relevant to an anti-terrorism investigation,<br/>\nincluding American citizens who are not themselves suspected of criminal<br/>\nactivity.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf particular concern to me is Section 215 of the Patriot Act. <br/>\n<br/>\nNormally, when a bookseller receives a subpoena for customer information, he<br/>\nor she has the opportunity to ask the court to quash the order on First<br/>\nAmendment grounds. In several cases, booksellers have successfully resisted<br/>\nsubpoenas.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder Section 215, however, booksellers may not have this chance. <br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on the wording of the order, the bookseller may be required to<br/>\nimmediately turn over the records that are being sought. In addition, there is<br/>\na gag provision preventing booksellers from alerting anyone that they have<br/>\nreceived such an order, making it nearly impossible to determine whether this<br/>\nnew power is being used... or abused.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Justice Department has refused to release any information about subpoenas<br/>\nissued -- despite repeated requests by the House Judiciary Committee. We know,<br/>\nanecdotally, that subpoenas have been issued. But we do not know how many<br/>\ntimes, when, or for what reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nEagle Harbor Book Co. has never tracked customer purchases. We do, however,<br/>\nkeep certain records required by law. And those records, unless the<br/>\ntransaction is in cash, could be used to connect a customer with his or her<br/>\npurchases.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps this law makes us more secure. That is very difficult to quantify.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut our right to read what we want, and, by extension, to think, to believe,<br/>\nand to say what we want, in complete privacy has clearly been eroded. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese are fundamental rights that define America, and they are being sold --<br/>\ntraded -- for the promise of security. Such small, often unnoticed choices to<br/>\nlimit our personal freedoms -- usually made with good intention --<br/>\nincrementally, inevitably, change our nation. Such decisions may be necessary<br/>\nin this changed world, but I urge you all to consider very carefully before<br/>\ngiving your support. A freedom that has been sold is very, very difficult to<br/>\nbuy back again. I don&#39;t want my children or grandchildren to look back 50<br/>\nyears from now and say, &quot;This used to be a free country-- what happened?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will face many more such important decisions in the coming months and<br/>\nyears. If this or other losses of personal freedom and privacy concern you,<br/>\nplease, speak with your congressperson. Talk with your neighbors,  your<br/>\nchildren. Write your newspaper. Contact your local independent bookstore.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, don&#39;t let decisions with such far-reaching results be made without<br/>\nyour input.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nA postscript: Leif Enger attracted nearly 100 people that night. He spoke<br/>\neloquently and it was a very special evening for all.
