It&#39;s usually a sign that I&#39;ve gotten too <br/>\ndistracted with my own stuff and need to come hang out with them and <br/>\ndo stuff. If they&#39;re short-tempered or fighting, a wrestling match on <br/>\nthe bed, or baking something hands-on in the kitchen (kneading bread <br/>\ndough or gooey cookies is a good one), or going outside to wander <br/>\ndown to the creek with them are all good options that don&#39;t involve <br/>\nimposing schoolwork.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  As <br/>\n&gt; far as them going off and delving into subjects all by themselves, <br/>\n&gt; NO WAY!

Kids who are made to do &quot;schoolwork&quot; will most <br/>\nnaturally avoid it when given time away from it. They might avoid <br/>\nanything that looks vaguely related to school subjects for hours, <br/>\ndays, months, or years, depending on their reactions to it. There&#39;s <br/>\nusually a time period known as &quot;deschooling&quot; when kids stop going to <br/>\nschool or doing school-at-home where the kids just need to decompress.<br/>\n2) Learning for kids *is* play, and play is learning. If learning <br/>\nisn&#39;t shown to them as something separated out and different from <br/>\neveryday life, it will just be a natural and joyous part of their <br/>\nevery day existance. Right now, my kids are playing with Legos. They <br/>\nmight do it for a few minutes or a few hours, and I can guarantee <br/>\nthat they&#39;re not reinacting a historical battle with the Lego <br/>\nfigures. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I guess I am wandering all over the place with this post <br/>\n&gt; but I would like to know about how structure can fit into the <br/>\n&gt; unschooling philosophy.  And can it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it can, if the child desires structure and creates it. My <br/>\nson, who is a Legomaniac, usually builds all kinds of interesting <br/>\ncreations of his own imagining. Every now and then, he&#39;ll pull out <br/>\nthe instructions for something (he saved them all in a box in his <br/>\nroom) and sit down and build for hours from the instructions. That is <br/>\nstructure that he&#39;s imposing. My daughter at age 3 asked for violin <br/>\nlessons. She is still taking them, chooses to go, chooses to practice <br/>\nevery day, wants to make the pieces of music sound better, asks for <br/>\nmy help, etc. That&#39;s structure that she&#39;s imposed. Other things are <br/>\nmuch more freeform. I guess it&#39;s the same in my life, some things I <br/>\nchoose structure, some things I choose none. It seems like the <br/>\nnatural way to go about things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Am I missing something about the unschooling philosophy?

For me, this happened over a period of years when my <br/>\nkids were young and I spent my nursing time on the couch with a copy <br/>\nof &quot;Learning All the Time&quot; by John Holt or &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot; by John <br/>\nTaylor Gatto, or &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; by Grace <br/>\nLlewellyn. Later, I found email lists, bulletin boards, etc. like <br/>\nthis one where these ideas were discussed in greater deail and in <br/>\nreal life situations. All of that immersion helped to free my own <br/>\nmind from some of its preconceived notions about learning <br/>\nand &quot;education&quot;. This list is a great resource.

They prefer to have<br/>\nfree reign and go at their own pace, no matter what that is. The most<br/>\nstructured thing would be playdates on certain days of the week. We usually<br/>\nhave a park day every Tues. which is never timed as far as when we get there<br/>\nor how long we stay. Usually Thurs. are craft days with a few other families<br/>\nwhich involves a craft of maybe 20 minutes and then free play time for a<br/>\ncouple hours. Every Fri. is homeschooling sports camp for 3 hours. Their<br/>\nFridays they won&#39;t miss. The other two are free to take it or leave it<br/>\ndepending on what is going on with us and who wants to go or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;As far as them going off and delving into subjects all by themselves,<br/>\nNO WAY!

And I do mean play!!! They are<br/>\n9,8 and 3. They watch tv, play games, play video games, play outside, swim,<br/>\ndraw, create, read, build, role play, etc. That IS their play and they do it<br/>\nwhenever they want. They learn so much every day. They are always coming up<br/>\nwith things that sometimes I don&#39;t even know where they got them from.<br/>\nThey&#39;re kids and the world is theirs to learn whatever interests them. And<br/>\nright now if it looks like &quot;just playing&quot; all day, that&#39;s fine with me. Of<br/>\ncourse with my kids, I don&#39;t see it as &quot;just playing,&quot; I see learning all<br/>\nthe time.

I know of a few unschooled kids<br/>\nthat make their own schedules, starting and stopping at their leisure. It&#39;s<br/>\nwhen it&#39;s imposed and forced that it stops being a part of unschooling for<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as getting it, I think you are looking in terms of learning from<br/>\nschool standards. That&#39;s something that a lot of people have a hard time<br/>\ngiving up and seeing any other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead the boards, stay here and read. Read the archives and Sandra&#39;s sites.<br/>\nTry to rid yourself of what learning is in school terms.
