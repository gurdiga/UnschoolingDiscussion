This seems to be more of <br/>\nmentoring situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you handle it if a dear friend or close relative came to you <br/>\nwith this question?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone came to me about not meeting expectations, a sister, a friend, <br/>\nI&#39;d ask them if they are telling me this because they want my help, or <br/>\nbecause they just need to let it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen according to the answer, I&#39;d ask if they need help or suggestions. <br/>\nOr I&#39;d just let them let the steam out and go merrily on the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they need suggestions, I&#39;d talk about goals and setting realistic <br/>\nones. I&#39;d talk about setting smaller goals that eventually lead up to the <br/>\nbig one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also &#39;check-in&#39; with them on occasion and ask how its going with <br/>\nthat issue. Again, according to the response, I&#39;d  tailor my conversation <br/>\naccordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I&#39;ve got issues that I&#39;m having a hard time getting through <br/>\non my own. These are not parenting issues. I&#39;m quite secure in that area. <br/>\nThese are issues concerning goals and expectations of myself in certain <br/>\nareas of my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I went to a mentor and wanted help with this issue, I wouldn&#39;t want to <br/>\nhear &#39;but thats okay because you&#39;re a great parent&#39;. I want to hear about <br/>\nthis issue and how I can get help to eventually overcome it.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nkolleen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31553,"nextTopicId":31486}}
