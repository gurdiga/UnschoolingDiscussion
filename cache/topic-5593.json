I&#39;m Cordelia, I have two sons, Jeff is 5, and Leif<br/>\nis 2.  I am pretty much sold on hs/unschooling.  My husband is not.  He&#39;s<br/>\nconcerned about our son not playing enough with other children.<br/>\nWe go to a playgroup every week for homeschoolers.  He&#39;s in a kindermusik<br/>\nclass weekly, does swimming weekly soon and I&#39;m going to enroll him in a<br/>\nclass at the rec center.  I do think we could do more individual playdates<br/>\nand play more with the neighborhood kids-<br/>\nAny suggestions/rebuttals(to my husband&#39;s concern) are welcome.<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nCordelia Schaffer<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cordelia@...\">cordelia@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n    GRAB THE GATOR!
