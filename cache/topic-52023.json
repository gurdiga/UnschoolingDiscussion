I don&#39;t see why discussing this issue would *limit* the scope of other discussions. I actually think it is helpful to see how people handle legal issues in practical ways in different parts of the country and world. Legal issues are an important aspect of what we do as unschoolers.

I don&#39;t think that someone should not<br/>\n&gt; unschool a certain way because of the state&#39;s laws.  You should find<br/>\n&gt; the educational and parenting philosophy that you agree with it and<br/>\n&gt; stick to your convictions.  Getting around the law shouldn&#39;t affect<br/>\n&gt; how you parent/edcuate. But it is something that many have to deal<br/>\n&gt; with because of the educational choices they have made.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the other hand, I don&#39;t see a discussion of how to get around a<br/>\n&gt; state law any different than discussion of how to get around a<br/>\n&gt; husband who isn&#39;t sure of unschooling or a relative who constantly<br/>\n&gt; quizzes the kids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kind of like how  a discussion of vaccinations might start out<br/>\n&gt; discussing all the dangers of vaccinations but the natural flow of<br/>\n&gt; conversation usually includes discussion on how to get around the<br/>\n&gt; state law&#39;s vaccination requirements.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sheila<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rather than change the definition of unschooling, or limit the<br/>\n&gt; scope of our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; discussions, to fit the legal ramifications of Pennsylvania or<br/>\n&gt; Kansas or New<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Zealand, I would rather discuss unschooling as  a pure endeavor,<br/>\n&gt; and let<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people worry about how to make it work in their place of<br/>\n&gt; residence.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There are state discussion lists already in place for local<br/>\n&gt; details.

I really don&#39;t think we should  say there is<br/>\n&gt; Ohio<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschooling and Texas unschooling.  (Although here is an Ohio aid:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum)\">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum)</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; IF someone really cared about gun laws and wanted to own guns and<br/>\n&gt; use them,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he might move out of Pennsylvania because of his beliefs and<br/>\n&gt; desires.

My<br/>\n&gt; youngest has a temper (must be the red hair) and loses it quite<br/>\n&gt; often. When he does he will lash our at other kids if they approach<br/>\n&gt; him and adults too and call people who try and speak to him &#39;f****<br/>\n&gt; bastards&#39;<br/>\n&gt; At home I&#39;ve fiound the only thing that works is to ignore him until<br/>\n&gt; he comes out of the temper. He can&#39;t be reasoned with, or jollied<br/>\n&gt; out of it or even threatened (which I treid in the past). Punishment<br/>\n&gt; and consequences mean nothing while his temper lasts.<br/>\n&gt; When it has passed we&#39;ve discussed it many times and he<br/>\n&gt; promises to try better in the future. None of this is a problem at<br/>\n&gt; home.<br/>\n&gt; While we&#39;re out this is a different matter. One friend tried to jolly<br/>\n&gt; him out of a temper and he called her a name and tried to hit her.<br/>\n&gt; He hit another friends dog when the dog tried to pinch his dinner.<br/>\n&gt; We are finding that we&#39;re not welcome anywhere which is affecting<br/>\n&gt; my other kids and me. I feel we&#39;re going to be alone, stuck in the<br/>\n&gt; house like social pariahs.<br/>\n&gt; My friends use time out and sending kids to their room which I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t agree with personally but in their own house I would never say<br/>\n&gt; anything. While I tell him that his behaviour isn&#39;t acceptable I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; obviously not going to beat him and I feel uncomfortable dicsiplining<br/>\n&gt; him in a way I would not do so at home. I really don&#39;t want to be<br/>\n&gt; friendless until he matures enough to stop, like the other two did.<br/>\n&gt; In some ways it is a cultural thing too, peope at home would have<br/>\n&gt; ignored the behaviour or laughed it off as a stage some kids go<br/>\n&gt; through.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any advice in how to deal with a stubborn 7 yo would be<br/>\n&gt; apreciated. Before I have to leave Virginia ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shyrley<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;You laugh at me because I&#39;m different.

My velour tree skirt was covered in hair and I<br/>\n&gt; just couldn&#39;t keep it clean for more than an hour. So I cleaned it one last<br/>\n&gt; time, wrapped all the gifts and put them under the tree. Cats can&#39;t get to<br/>\n&gt; it now. I thought after my 2 year old started to ask to open them that it<br/>\n&gt; was a mistake. But she surprised me as usual and has been very good. No<br/>\n&gt; shaking or anything. She understands now that on Christmas she can open<br/>\n&gt; some. Of course she has no idea when that is so every day she asks. She also<br/>\n&gt; goes and shows everyone how we have Merry Christmas under the tree!

The state regs are <br/>\npretty simple, but lots of school administration ( or other state <br/>\norganizations) want to try to strong arm parents into thinking there is <br/>\n&quot;more&quot; to the regs.  For example, my sister told me just the other day that a <br/>\nfriend of hers homeschools her children.  My sister (Karen) said.. &quot; yeah, <br/>\nshe was telling me all about all the logs and records she has to keep&quot;  I <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Uhh, no, she doesnt&quot;  Karen said.. &quot;well, she thinks she does.  she <br/>\nkeeps records of everything..

She has been misled by someone, probably a ps school <br/>\nofficial or perhaps some curriculum salesperson.   In this case, this girl <br/>\nbeing aware of state regs would save her a lot of time and trouble.    <br/>\n<br/>\nMMMM Good crow.. :-)  Im finding all sorts of ways to spice this bird up.. <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\nOH,  btw, Sandra, I do agree, this is not really a political forum... But I <br/>\nthink that just like parenting practices overlap and mesh into  unschooling, <br/>\nso does politics.  There are many issues that just sort of cross over.   <br/>\nActually, I am not a political person.
