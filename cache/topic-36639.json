That <br/>\n  means you can cause them by threat or force or shame or whatever to sit and <br/>\n  put numbers on a piece of paper.  But they&#39;re not really doing anything <br/>\n  themselves, and you can make them loathe numbers on paper.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n  How true! How true!!  <br/>\n   (example): My son was an A student in spelling when he went to public school, BECAUSE, we started on Sunday night MEMORIZING the spelling words for that week.  We studied EVERY NIGHT unbtil spelling test on Friday, using little rhythm games and such to instill these words in his mind.  FORCE!!  2 weeks later he couldn&#39;t spell 50% of them.  Force does not constitute LEARNING!   Being Forced  to put numbers on paper does not teach them to *THINK* math!  <br/>\n  I&#39;ve found that building things helps us  to learn math better than anything we do.  We&#39;ve built Bluebird houses from old barn lumber, bird feeders, etc.  We even remodeled his bedroom and expanded it to include space for his personal things (stereo, computer, guitar amps, etc.)   He is so capable of doing almost anything when left to his own *drive* and interests.  Whereas now  it is next to IMPOSSIBLE to FORCE him to do anything  since he has experienced the joy of learning on his own.  The joy of UNSCHOOLING!!!!  <br/>\n  Still haven&#39;t decided what I&#39;m to do about TN regulations next year but I know we&#39;re not going back to *structured* learning.  (Books and papers, tests and grades that sort of thing.)  <br/>\n  Betty- Mom to 14yo Josh<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I made that decision after only one time seeing a<br/>\nwoman at church change her child who was wearing &quot;training pants&quot; and he had<br/>\npooped them. In the process of removing them, the poop got smeared all over<br/>\nhis legs - it was an awful mess to clean up. I decided right then and there<br/>\nthat my kids would come out of diapers when they were ready and we wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe messing with poopy training pants. My oldest was the easiest. For some<br/>\nreason, my ds didn&#39;t have a clue what I was talking about when I tried to<br/>\ntalk to him about the potty, even by the age of three, so I let him run<br/>\naround the house one day with a bare bottom, and I followed him everywhere<br/>\nhe went. He started to potty while he was playing, and I said &quot;stop! do that<br/>\nin the potty!&quot; Then I scooped him up and took him to the bathroom, sat him<br/>\non the toilet, and told him he could finish there. That was it! After that<br/>\nhe only wore diapers to bed or when we went on trips. The day my only<br/>\ndaughter turned two, she said that she wasn&#39;t going to wear diapers anymore<br/>\nbecause she was a big girl. She did real good for about 2 weeks, then<br/>\ndecided that it was too much trouble to come in from playing everytime she<br/>\nhad to go. So she asked for her diapers back. Much to my mother&#39;s<br/>\naggravation, I complied. She still used the potty occasionally, but stayed<br/>\nin diapers until she was 3. At that time, she wanted to take dance lessons.<br/>\nI told her they didn&#39;t let kids in diapers take dance lessons. She never<br/>\nwore another diaper! She had the physical ability before then, but not<br/>\nenough desire. Her desire for dance lessons was greater than her reluctance<br/>\nto have playtime interupted for the potty, so ... she gave up the diapers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I can whole heartedly agree with Sandra, that they will use the potty<br/>\nwhen they have both the physical/mental ability, and the desire.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36678,"nextTopicId":36635}}
