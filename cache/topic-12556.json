I<br/>\nwent back to bed to &#39;play&#39; with the money. I basically just liked the sound<br/>\nof the coins running through my fingers; the thought that I might be doing<br/>\nsomething &quot;wrong&quot; didn&#39;t really fully enter my mind. Then my aunt came up<br/>\nthe stairs, heard the sound of money and asked me what I was doing. I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow why, but I felt myself contract when she asked the question and I said<br/>\n&quot;nothing&quot;. When she asked what it was I was playing with in my bed, again I<br/>\nsaid &quot;nothing&quot;. She came into the room and pulled the covers back to reveal<br/>\nthe handful of change and asked me where I got it from. I don&#39;t clearly<br/>\nremember, but I must have at that point realized that any further lying<br/>\nwasn&#39;t going to get me anywhere and told her the truth. My aunt went to tell<br/>\nmy grandmother.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater that day, my aunt was sitting on the sofa in my room, I was standing<br/>\nin front of her as she shared with me how it wasn&#39;t ok for me to have gone<br/>\ninto her room and taken money without asking. I could tell that she wasn&#39;t<br/>\nangry, she just wanted me to ask in the future and because I felt a warm<br/>\nconnection with her in that moment I said to myself that I would never do<br/>\nsuch a thing again, that I would instead ask her first as she was<br/>\nrequesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that moment my grandmother quietly came up behind me and without my<br/>\nanticipating her at all, she whacked me on the backside with a yellow<br/>\nplastic carpet beater. Just once, but hard. I still remember looking at the<br/>\nred marks on me later that day. And as she whacked me she said &quot;that was for<br/>\nlying to us&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot begin to adequately describe to you how utterly betrayed I felt in<br/>\nthat moment, betrayed by my aunt for knowing  my grandmother was coming and<br/>\nnot warning me. My connection with my aunt went to pieces, my trust in her<br/>\ngoodwill towards me was shattered in that very moment and never completely<br/>\nregained. I felt enraged at my grandmother for being so &quot;mean&quot; to me as to<br/>\nsneak up behind me and &quot;attack&quot; me like that. And I made an instant oath of<br/>\nretribution: that somehow I would make both my aunt and my grandmother pay<br/>\nfor how they had treated me on that one occasion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not make a consciously formulated oath, but my actions from there on<br/>\ntell me, in hindsight that I did make the oath, even if unconsciously, and<br/>\nthat I carried it out on a daily basis by lying to and taking money from my<br/>\naunt and grandmother at every opportunity; and making sure I would not get<br/>\ncaught.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy am I telling you this? Because until a few weeks ago, during our first<br/>\ncouples&#39; group together, I had not made the connection between those events<br/>\nof my childhood and how they still affect my life and my relationship with<br/>\nFran (my husband) today: we have a major debt to deal with and we have to be<br/>\ncareful how we spend &quot;our&quot; &#39;borrowed&#39; money, and yet I find myself regularly<br/>\nmaking purchases which are not necessary and which are above our budget, and<br/>\neverytime I do that, I feel as though I am stealing, especially when I don&#39;t<br/>\ninform Fran about what I am buying and why. Then a part of me waits to get<br/>\n&quot;hit&quot; by Fran&#39;s reaction when the visa statement comes in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have, with Fran&#39;s help, re-created dysfunctional aspects of my<br/>\nrelationship with my grandmother for the purpose of healing those aspects<br/>\nwithin myself. The rage and the sense of betrayal I felt as a child was<br/>\nnever healed and I keep re-creating situations in which I expect to feel<br/>\nthis rage and sense of betrayal which is related to feeling not cared about.<br/>\nThis is where Fran comes in, because whenever my visa statement comes in, he<br/>\njust pays it off quietly without ever questioning me. The &quot;hit&quot; that I<br/>\nalways expect, never comes, and on some deep level I interpret that as &quot;Fran<br/>\nreally doesn&#39;t care about me spending the money = he really doesn&#39;t care<br/>\nabout me&quot;. Then it&#39;s time for me to beat up on myself mentally to prove to<br/>\nmyself that I am not lovable.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, when my grandmother hit me she was coming from a place of &quot;I am<br/>\ndoing this for your own good, because I care about you and because I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant you to grow up lying and stealing&quot;.  Well, with her method she achieved<br/>\nthe exact opposite, and here it is 29 years later, and several years of<br/>\ntherapy and I am only now able to see the more subtle ways in which I still<br/>\nsteal and lie about things, and the ways in which I equate love and caring<br/>\nwith getting hit (in some form or another).<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven my grandmother&#39;s history and the tools she had to work with, I know<br/>\nthat she truly believed she was doing me a favour and showing caring, even<br/>\nthough I did not experience it that way; and I am truly excited to have put<br/>\nthese pieces of the puzzle of my life together, because now I have the<br/>\nability to choose consciously how I spend money and include Fran in the<br/>\nprocess, rather than react out of my unconscious, and seemingly be unable to<br/>\ncontrol my spending. And I see clearly that getting hit is not the same as<br/>\nbeing loved and cared about. I &quot;knew&quot; that already, but some part of me deep<br/>\ndown inside didn&#39;t feel it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was my own personal experience and not at all like your experience with<br/>\nyour son in the mall. My point however is that even one single event such as<br/>\nthis one can have long lasting effects. In no way was I ever intending to<br/>\nimply that you are &quot;a child abuser&quot;, just as my grandmother wasn&#39;t. She<br/>\nreally believed she was doing me a favour and teaching me a lesson. Her<br/>\nmethod did not work, but I know absolutely for sure, that my aunts method<br/>\n(of simply connecting with me at the heart level and asking for what she<br/>\nneeded from me) would have worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis brings me to your question:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am curious as to some of the things you have learned in your class<br/>\n&gt; with DH. How have you come to terms and found common ground with the<br/>\n&gt; differences you have in your childrenrearing techniques?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We have been going to separate circles (men&#39;s group and women&#39;s group) for<br/>\nover a year and a half. On my own I began serious self-healing work about<br/>\nseven years ago, Fran and I have been married for four years. In these<br/>\ncircles we focus on &quot;how is the past coloring and affecting the present?&quot;<br/>\nFor example I would get furious with Fran for losing his temper with &#39;my<br/>\ndaughters&#39; and getting into horrendous arguments with them. Through his work<br/>\nin circle, Fran has come to realize how much he is like his own father and<br/>\ngrandfather, when he loses his temper like that and how much it hurt him as<br/>\na little boy, to be reduced to tears by his father&#39;s angry voice, how<br/>\nterrified he would be of his dad, how he would always have to keep his radar<br/>\ngoing to find out what kind of mood dad was in, if it was safe to speak.<br/>\nAcknowledging how he was doing the same thing to our kids was not easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever: since Fran has made a conscious effort to control his temper with<br/>\nthe children, I have been faced with an underlying reason for Fran&#39;s anger:<br/>\nhe was watching my daughters treat me like their slave in many respects, and<br/>\nhe was furious at them for treating me that way. What he did not realize<br/>\nthat I had &quot;trained&quot; them to treat me that way, out of my own guilt for<br/>\nleaving their father, etc. Whenever he would yell at them for something I<br/>\nwould immediately focus on his anger and so not be able to see what was<br/>\nreally going on. He was overreacting to their behaviours precisely because I<br/>\nwas underreacting. Once he stopped overreacting the intensity between my<br/>\ndaughters and myself was allowed to surface and was brought face to face<br/>\nwith my &quot;slave&quot;. There came a point where decided &quot;enough is enough&quot; and I<br/>\nbegan to take steps to move out of that role with my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe circle helped us in this particular issue by helping Fran to stop<br/>\noverreacting to my girls while at the same time expressing to me how he felt<br/>\nwhen they treated me like their slave. Circle helped Fran to express his<br/>\nfeelings in an authentic, non-blaming, non-judgemental kind of way, which I<br/>\nwas able to hear. And eventually it sunk in and I felt motivated for my own<br/>\nsake to do something about it. Since then I have been able to be a lot<br/>\nclearer about what my boundaries are, when I mean &quot;no&quot; and stick to it, what<br/>\nbehaviours are not acceptable to me, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nCircle helps Fran and I to look at where certain reaction really come from.<br/>\nThe more intensely we react to something, the older the trigger, meaning the<br/>\nfurther back into our own childhood we need to go to see what aspect of us<br/>\nis needing healing.<br/>\n<br/>\nCircle helps us to truly dialogue about issues, rather than discuss or<br/>\nargue. &quot;discussion&quot; is when everybody talks and no one really listens to the<br/>\nother(s); everybody has their own opinions to defend. &quot;Dialogue&quot; on the<br/>\nother hand, is when people really open up their whole being to receive what<br/>\nsomeone else is saying, taking what has been said inside themselves to<br/>\ndiligently examine if there is any objective Truth to be found in what the<br/>\nother person is saying, acknowledging that Truth (if there is any) to<br/>\neveryone and then sharing their own experience on the topic while everyone<br/>\nelse really listens in return.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a book about this called &quot;On Dialogue&quot; by David Bohm. It is<br/>\nrequired reading for the circles I belong to. Decisions are arrived at by<br/>\nconsensus through this process of sharing an experience/ opinion, the others<br/>\nsuspending all judgement and really listening and then sharing their<br/>\nexperience in return. (i did not do this in my first post responding to your<br/>\nfirst post - I am not perfect at this yet, my emotions took over and I<br/>\nreacted instead).<br/>\n<br/>\nI quote David Bohm: &quot;&#39;dialogue&#39; comes from the Greek word &#39;dialogos&#39;.<br/>\n&#39;Logos&#39; means &quot;the word&quot;. And &#39;dia&#39; means &quot;through&quot; - it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;two&quot;.<br/>\nA dialogue can be among any number of people, not just two. Even one person<br/>\ncan have a sense of dialogue within himself, if the spirit of the dialogue<br/>\nis present. The picture or image that this derivation suggests is of a<br/>\n&#39;stream of meaning&#39; flowing among and through us and between us. This will<br/>\nmake possible a flow of meaning in the whole group, out of which may emerge<br/>\nsome new understanding. It&#39;s something new, which may not have been in the<br/>\nstarting point at all. It&#39;s something creative. And this shared meaning is<br/>\nthe &quot;glue&quot; or &quot;cement&quot; that holds people and societies together.<br/>\nContrast this with the word &quot;discussion&quot;, which has the same root as<br/>\n&quot;percussion&quot; and &quot;concussion&quot;. It really means to break things up. It<br/>\nemphasizes the idea of analysis, where there may be many points of view, and<br/>\nwhere everybody is presenting a different one - analyzing and breaking up.<br/>\nThat obviously has its value, but it is limited, and it will not get us very<br/>\nfar beyond our various points of view. Discussion is almost like a ping-pong<br/>\ngame, where people are batting the ideas back and forth and the object of<br/>\nthe game is to win or to get points for yourself. Possibly you will take up<br/>\nsomebody else&#39;s ideas to back up your own - you may agree with some and<br/>\ndisagree with others - but the basic point is to win the game. That&#39;s very<br/>\nfrequently the case in a discussion. In a dialogue however, nobody is trying<br/>\nto win. Everybody wins, if anybody wins. There is a different sort of spirit<br/>\nto it. In a dialogue there is no attempt to gain points, or to make your<br/>\nparticular view prevail. Rather, whenever any mistake is discovered on the<br/>\npart of anybody, everybody gains.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a situation called win-win, whereas the other game is win-lose - if I<br/>\nwin, you lose. But a dialogue is something more of a common participation,<br/>\nin which we are not playing a game against each other, but &#39;with&#39; each<br/>\nother. In a dialogue, everybody wins.&quot;  end of quote<br/>\n<br/>\nSo whenever an issue arises, be it over the children, how to spend money,<br/>\nhow much (or little) intimacy there is between us - whatever the case may<br/>\nbe - circle is teaching us to use certain tools, such as: dialogue, telling<br/>\nour microscopic truth while breathing deeply (diaphragmatically),<br/>\nacknowledging ourselves and each other for being truthful and taking 100%<br/>\nresponse-ability for our own experience (= no blaming the other for how we<br/>\nourselves are feeling or perceiving something). Sometimes we get so deeply<br/>\ntriggered that we need help in the moment. Then we get on the phone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this answers your question, but in closing I would like to<br/>\nshare with you something else we learned in self-healing circles: how to<br/>\ncreate a relationship vision and how to work towards living that vision.
