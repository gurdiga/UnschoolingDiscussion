It does not come with a disclaimer nor<br/>\ndoes the movie.  Further, it is offensive to a large segment of the American<br/>\nIndian population, particularly the Cherokee.  It is no different than if it<br/>\nwere to be discovered that The Diary of Anne Frank were written by Hitler or<br/>\nThe Color Purple were written by a white supremist.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, because it gets itself recategorized on some list does not change how<br/>\nit is presented to the general public NOW, still even though it has been<br/>\nrecategorized as fiction.

The most<br/>\nsensitive and evocative *autobiography* . . .  Amazon.com<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is one of the most accepted books in ps for teaching Indian culture.  It<br/>\nis a fraud and as such it cannot teach as it has no factual basis.  It is<br/>\npure new-age bunk and garbage.  If one wants to read his other books, great.<br/>\nNo one was saying he wasn&#39;t a good author or that one shouldn&#39;t read his<br/>\nbooks.  He created a new personna so he could &quot;sell&quot; Indian heritage, as<br/>\nsuch he is a fraud!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou get a little carried away here.  No one was rejecting the bulk of his<br/>\nwork.  No one was judging his ability as an author.  The judgement was on<br/>\nhis lies.  He is NOT Cherokee, he was NOT an orphan, it is NOT an<br/>\nautobiography.  I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s patooty if he hangs from a tree, quotes<br/>\nHale and spends all his time reading Hustler as long as he doesn&#39;t claim to<br/>\nbe Indian and try to sell his lies as being the real article.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust curious, though, how can one be inspired or philosophical over a book<br/>\nof lies.  How does one find inspiration or find its &quot;philosophy&quot; useful if<br/>\none knows the whole book is based on a lie and that a good percentage of<br/>\nwhat he wrote as being &quot;the Cherokee way&quot; or words from the Cherokee<br/>\nlanguage were things he made up?<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 21, 2001 10:02 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Herd Instinct<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Lynda, you wrote<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; And before anyone gets their bloomers in a bunch or knots in their<br/>\nthong<br/>\n&gt; (which is probably more current &lt;g&gt;) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would like to ask as calmly and respectfully as possible that you try<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; to be so antagonistic and insulting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Education of Little Tree is indeed fraudulent as it was originally<br/>\n&gt; presented.  It was published by the University of New Mexico Press and so<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; unfolding of the discovery was big in local news.  In the long run, the<br/>\nbook<br/>\n&gt; was recategorized as fiction and is still found useful by lots of people<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; its philosophy and inspiration, I suppose, which is what lots of novels<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; good for.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not defending the book.  I haven&#39;t read it.  I have friends who have<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; liked it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m defending balance and calm.  Lots of writers and artists and musicians<br/>\n&gt; were drunks or addicts or perverts or gamblers or whatever.  We&#39;re not<br/>\n&gt; building religions out of them.  I see no reason to reject all of an<br/>\nartist&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; product because of his or her political or sexual or biochemical bent.  I<br/>\n&gt; know some people will disagree with me.  Photographs by a heterosexual<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; no discovered sexual misconduct are more respected by some people (whether<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re good or not) than photographs by someone who is gay or lesbian.<br/>\n&gt; People who believe that way would probably not say &quot;gay or lesbian,&quot;<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n&gt; Prejudices are all around us and it seems to me we might as well not make<br/>\n&gt; them worse unnecessarily.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
