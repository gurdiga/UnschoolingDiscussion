At<br/>\nmy house we just live and learn without lessons or curriculum.  (We have<br/>\npiles of books, games and videos, though.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to imagine if you haven&#39;t really soaked up the unschooling<br/>\nphilosophy and had lots of time to observe unschooled kids.  The<br/>\nclearest way I can paint a picture of it is to say that unschooling is<br/>\nlike summer vacation or Saturday, all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo explain how kids learn without school would take me more time than I<br/>\nhave here.  (But I hope others will jump in and help.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Hello and Intro","postDate":"1046367784","msgId":59730,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEtRjE3OHllSDRiZ2N0ckowMDAxZjE1NEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":59716,"nextInTopic":59740,"prevInTime":59729,"nextInTime":59731,"topicId":59716,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Penny and welcome.

I&#39;m sure your children have their unique challenges <br/>\nand that those labels are helpful in getting them the services and attention <br/>\nthat they need to &quot;keep up&quot; with a school-type schedule. Many of us have <br/>\nbeen right where you are now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT...if you&#39;ll read a bit here and at unschooling.com, you&#39;ll hear LOTS of <br/>\nstories of how we discovered that our children didn&#39;t need those labels, and <br/>\neven many of the services they were receiving, once the school schedule was <br/>\nremoved. With the freedom of unschooling, my children have been able to <br/>\nlearn and develop at their own pace. They&#39;re not behind or ahead. They are <br/>\nexactly where they are and learning all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a link to an article I wrote about my son&#39;s school experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/special/mary\">http://sandradodd.com/special/mary</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll let you know right now that we dealt with many of the labels you <br/>\nmentioned above in addition to the one I mentioned in the article. While <br/>\nyou&#39;re at that site, you may want to read Anne Ohman&#39;s article as well. Also <br/>\ncheck about the stories of later readers.

We don&#39;t worry about school subjects, so <br/>\nthere isn&#39;t anything I feel we need to fit into our day in that respect.
