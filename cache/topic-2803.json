Well, no.� so does that make you think<br/>\n&gt; there is something &quot;wrong&quot; with Zach?� Well, no - but that&#39;s different.<br/>\n&gt; (Hmm - Why?)<br/>\n&gt; So I told her that They really hadn&#39;t had much time together this summer and<br/>\n&gt; they were just enjoying each other&#39;s company. And if Zach hadn&#39;t been there<br/>\n&gt; I was sure he would have made friends with some other kids, (because he has<br/>\n&gt; in similar situations) but he just didn&#39;t need to with Zach around. Seemed<br/>\n&gt; like pretty independant behavior to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The really amazing thing was there was another boy their same age that they<br/>\n&gt; tried to interact with.� His mother was along for the week and he was a real<br/>\n&gt; pain, hanging on her, arguing about where they were going to sit on the bus,<br/>\n&gt; wanting all of her attention, etc and not interacting with the other kids at<br/>\n&gt; all - but no one questioned his behavior.� (Except his mom - he was making<br/>\n&gt; her crazy)� I can only imagine what the response would have been had I gone<br/>\n&gt; along and my DS had acted like that.� I wonder why people set up different<br/>\n&gt; standards for homeschooled kids?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone else experienced anything like that?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Becky in Ohio<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>�</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jac & Liz Grimes","from":"Jac & Liz Grimes &lt;JGrimes@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"DFTkxDt1P3y0VyNyALWQyUN9c8soMmDUhQDXCGojcw6RUNLokCBXw6pUqQkWV-NOcoHhgJoE3p13wvZ2Anz59bByobgUN-XMyINiU1c","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 197","postDate":"936873032","msgId":2803,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xOTguMjgwMy45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2816,"prevInTime":2802,"nextInTime":2804,"topicId":2803,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... authority. ... the one ...
