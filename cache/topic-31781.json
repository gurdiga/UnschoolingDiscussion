Sounds like fun! This is not to say you need to<br/>\nchange anything about what you&#39;re doing. Only to gently suggest that if<br/>\nyou&#39;re looking for ideas to make things kids need to know fun, you&#39;ll find<br/>\nthe offerings on this list slim in that area. If, on the otherhand, you&#39;re<br/>\ntrying to feel more comfortable that living is learning, trying to let go of<br/>\nlevels and the idea that some things are necessary to learn, then there&#39;s<br/>\nlots of helpful advice here.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t have anything to do with learning what everyone is<br/>\ncertain everyone needs to know. Unschooling is letting go of the idea that<br/>\nkids need to multiply or learn geography or history or grammar or how to<br/>\nwrite. Those things *will* be part of their lives and kids *will* reach a<br/>\nlevel of competence that is useful to them. Books will be set in real<br/>\nlocations, games will be played that need arithmetic to be better at,<br/>\nmessage boards will have messages that kids will want to respond to. (Or not<br/>\nif their interests lie elsewhere.) The concept of unschooling is that, just<br/>\nas they took what path they found most useful for their own needs in<br/>\nlearning to speak (talking about dinosaurs or poop or Teletubbies), kids<br/>\nwill acquire what they need as adults by exploring the paths of their<br/>\ninterests. Whatever level of geography (or whatever) they acquire naturally<br/>\nthrough living -- and continue acquiring through  out their lives -- is the<br/>\nlevel that they will need as adults. *If* they need a higher level for some<br/>\npurpose that suddenly strikes them, they will either set about acquiring it<br/>\nbecause they know they can learn whatever they set out to learn, or they<br/>\nwill have already acquired it because it&#39;s part of the things they are<br/>\nnaturally drawn to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My kids do well on standardized testing with one of then 6 grades higher<br/>\n&gt; than his PS placement would be this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In unschooling there are no grades or placements. Unschooled kids are where<br/>\nthey are according to their own needs, not some standard.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Felicia (just turned 10 in August) is having trouble with multiplication and<br/>\n&gt; division.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because she has a need in her right now life for multiplication and division<br/>\n(a job? love of a particular game or type of puzzle?) and she isn&#39;t up to<br/>\ndoing what she feels she needs? Or because she&#39;s not performing at some<br/>\ngrade-level standard?<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this is not saying what you&#39;re doing is wrong, only that if you want<br/>\nideas on doing more of the same, other lists (like one that deals with<br/>\neclectic homeschooling) will have *way* more ideas for you than this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":29703411,"authorName":"parrishmlus","from":"&quot;parrishmlus&quot; &lt;parrishml@...&gt;","profile":"parrishmlus","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: introduction of Oakes Family","postDate":"1012387842","msgId":31795,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEzOGo2MitoOGdnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMi5mYjQ5NzhmLjI5ODg3ZWU0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":31794,"nextInTopic":31798,"prevInTime":31794,"nextInTime":31796,"topicId":31781,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
