The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1726141141\">Regarding the origins of Christianity, in truth Christianity was started in Israel by a Jew named Jesus.  And Catholicism is not actually the original.  The first Christians believed they were reformed Jews and called themselves The Way.  And there were offshoots of The Way dating back to the time of the Apostles (Gnostics are a good example, mentioned in the Bible.)  Catholicism began to formalize itself as a structured &quot;religion&quot; in the early years of Europe&#39;s recovery after the fall of Rome in the 400&#39;s and was established as a major player when Charlemagne was crowned the Holy Roman Emperor in the 800&#39;s.  Within a couple hundred years, the Catholic church experience its&#39; first split when the Eastern Orthodox church split from Rome.  BTW, catholic is simply a word meaning &quot;universal&quot; and the creed in my church says &quot;I believe in the catholic church...&quot; (Methodist).  And I believe Sandra is correct about denominations - There are Catholics and then there are Protestants, who are divided into denominations and most definately split from the Catholics during the Reformation (apologies to the Baptists who believe their denomination dates back to Christ, but history just doesn&#39;t bear this out...)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy goodness doesn&#39;t a history degree combined with a lifelong passion for history come in handy?!?  If you ever want to know the really smart PR way that the medieval Catholics &quot;borrowed&quot; a bunch of pagan holidays and incorporated them into the church in order to win converts, just let me know....&lt;grin&gt; My four year old daughter already knows the basics of Halloween, Christmas and Easter.
