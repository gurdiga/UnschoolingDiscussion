Anyone can belive in Jesus...its what we do with that knowledge (and your accountable if you have the &quot;full truth&quot; of the faith....how our concience is formed comes into play here) that is key. So there is Purgetory to deal with our &quot;leftover&quot; sins before we can go sinless to a Holy God. Also we belive that we cannot know what all of God&#39;s provisions might be for others since man cannot grasp the mystery of God&#39;s infinate grace and mercy. I always had a hard time with the &quot;once saved&quot; explinations hard without some way for God to act in Mercy at the end depending on how a life had been lived and what information a person may have had.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there are those Christians who belive in &quot;The Elect&quot;.
