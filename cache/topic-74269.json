Start looking for a reputable animal rescue <br/>\norganization in your area.  The Humane Society is good, BUT, they often get <br/>\noverloaded with animals and it becomes difficult for them to place them all.  <br/>\nSometimes, you have to get on a waiting list for the Humane Society to take the <br/>\nanimal.  Often, there are other, privately ran, non-profit animal rescue groups <br/>\nthat can take the puppies.   Usually, these groups have several foster families <br/>\nwho care for animals until they are placed.  You may be able to foster the <br/>\npuppies yourself until they are placed.. Or, if that is not an option, they will <br/>\nplace them with a family who is equipped to foster them.   Rescue groups <br/>\ntypically have the animals vaccinated, and have them sterilized.   If an animal is <br/>\nsick, they nurse it back to health before they place it.   Usually, there is an <br/>\nadoption fee that  helps them cover the cost of care for the animal.    A <br/>\ngood animal rescue group screens the adoptive familes, and has them sign a <br/>\ncontract stating that they can reclaim the animal if they find out the contract has <br/>\nbeen broken.    Animal rescue groups place dogs through several avenues.  They <br/>\n may use the &#39;adopt-a-pet&quot; programs at pet supply stores.  Most of them also <br/>\nhave web sites with thier available animals listed with pictures.   Here is <br/>\nthe link to the rescue group I have worked with in my area.<br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.petfinder.org/shelters/NC11.html\">http://www.petfinder.org/shelters/NC11.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLook online, in the yellow pages, and perhaps call local vets for referrals <br/>\nfor a good local animal rescue group.  Also, you may find some good resources <br/>\nin some Yahoo groups.  I was once on an animal rescue group, but now I cant <br/>\nremember the name of it.   Anyway, with a little research,  you can probably find <br/>\nsome folks who can help you out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think most anything is a better alternative to taking them to the pound.   <br/>\nThe rescue groups I know sometimes rescue animals from the pound if they think <br/>\nthey have a chance of finding a home for them.    Good luck!  <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74233,"nextTopicId":73964}}
