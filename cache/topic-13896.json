Does she like any sports (swimming, biking, rollerblading, <br/>\nhiking...)? How about movies or trips to the zoo or a children&#39;s museum? <br/>\nDoes she like making crafty stuff?

Pick really interesting and complex books <br/>\nbeyond her current reading level. Those are great for sharing together. Try <br/>\ngetting her some magazines too. My Casey doesn&#39;t read too many books on her <br/>\nown, but she loves her magazines...American Girl, Ranger Rick, Stone Soup, <br/>\netc. Comics like Charlie Brown, Garfield, and Fox Trot are great too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;sometimes I feel like she isn&#39;t interested in anything.  how do I help to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;spark her interest?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>By relaxing and enjoying playing around with her. By showing and sharing <br/>\n*your* interets with her. By forgetting about school altogether and focusing <br/>\non the joy of being and doing stuff together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I sometimes feel like I have just hit a roadblock with her and I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;&gt;know where to go from here.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve hit the SCHOOL roadblock.

I just keep putting little quotes and excerpts up on<br/>\n&gt; the refridge, table.... where ever I think he might see them.   Like right now<br/>\n&gt; , the quote from Linda Dobson is up.  So far he has been pretty receptive, I<br/>\n&gt; think it is such a jump for some people tho&#39;,  to me its makes so much sense,<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling that is.  I think if I gently ease him into the thought it will be<br/>\n&gt; just fine.. I just have to be patient like she(Linda D.) says,  I think both<br/>\n&gt; of you who just introduced yourselves are on the right track.  I love seeing<br/>\n&gt; so many people new,  it gives me faith that more and more people will see the<br/>\n&gt; logic of our ways!!<br/>\n&gt; I have to say that this is the first fall that I havn&#39;t been a basket case,<br/>\n&gt; gee, just happens to be the first fall we&#39;ve unschooled.  Usually the stress<br/>\n&gt; of school starting up practically shuts me down,  not this year!  I have<br/>\n&gt; fibromyalgia, (can never spell it) and the stress of school really was<br/>\n&gt; horrible. When I was young and now as a parent.  Can&#39;t wait for everyone else<br/>\n&gt; to go tho&#39; and we can go out and really enjoy our life.  It is so good to be<br/>\n&gt; home with my kids!<br/>\n&gt; Loving unschooling, especially during fall in northern Minnesota!<br/>\n&gt; Kelli<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robin9700@...\">robin9700@...</a> wrote:In a message dated 9/2/2002 10:59:31 AM Eastern<br/>\n&gt; Standard Time, <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Welcome Robin, that is SO true.

I not only have problems about their inclusivity, but also that it<br/>\n&gt; looks a heckuva lot like school these days.  It used to be that cubs were<br/>\n&gt; grades 2-4, webaloes 5, and boy scouts 6-12.  Now (at least here...), the<br/>\n&gt; cub scouts meet together once a month, but for weekly meetings, it&#39;s tigers<br/>\n&gt; in 1st grade, wolves in 2nd grade, bears in 3rd grade, etc.  Being not<br/>\n&gt; overly fond of the school model, that doesn&#39;t thrill me.  Part of the appeal<br/>\n&gt; of scouting when I was a girl scout was having the older girls help me do<br/>\n&gt; stuff and looking forward to when *I* was one of the older girls.  Mixed age<br/>\n&gt; stuff.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just hesitant to jump into a commitment, I guess.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; brenda<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 12<br/>\n&gt;  Date: Mon, 2 Sep 2002 15:32:52 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;  From: Kelli Traaseth &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kellitraas@...\">kellitraas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Newbie, too!

When he went to the Marines, he sent home much of<br/>\n&gt; his paycheck, he used one of his bonuses to buy her a car. He saved two other<br/>\n&gt; bonuses (all hazardous pay bonuses) to put a down payment on a house for her.<br/>\n&gt; When he and I met, much of that stopped, although we lived with her for about<br/>\n&gt; six months and we paid most of the bills for her during that time. (she was<br/>\n&gt; between husbands number 5 and 6) When we got married and had left the<br/>\n&gt; reception, she stood at the curb and cried, saying over and over &quot;My baby&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; gone, she took him away.&quot; I learned this from one of my Great-aunts who<br/>\n&gt; called me the day we got back from our honey moon to tell me. When I had<br/>\n&gt; Moly, she was so excited, Moly was the first girl in their family in over 40<br/>\n&gt; years. (since Darin&#39;s sister was born) When I told her Moly&#39;s name and how we<br/>\n&gt; spell it, she told me how stupid it was, handed Darin a list of *family*<br/>\n&gt; names and said she wouldn&#39;t be back unless it was changed. She didn&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; Moly for the first 6 months of her life. When Jack was born, she came to the<br/>\n&gt; hospital. I was there for three days before I had him (I wasn&#39;t in Labor that<br/>\n&gt; long, it was other things) and she thought I was going to have him. When I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have him that first night, she left saying &quot;Just call me when she<br/>\n&gt; finally has this one.&quot; After he was born she threw a fit over his name too,<br/>\n&gt; because she had had an alcoholic uncle named Jack and hated him. (She still<br/>\n&gt; refuses to call him Jack, she calls him Jackie.) I could go on and on, the<br/>\n&gt; list is endless, I am the monkey on her back, her enigma.<br/>\n&gt; ~Nancy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;       Yahoo!

I<br/>\nhave a dd, 8 years old who has never been to any type of school.  we have<br/>\nalways been in the middle; unschooling/some traditional things as well.  my<br/>\ndd has never liked the &quot;traditional&quot; approach, so it has always led me back<br/>\nto the unschooling method.  I feel that is only natural to follow her leads.<br/>\nschooling the traditional way has caused several arguments, tears, and<br/>\nfrustration.  at times it has been difficult for me to just let go and<br/>\nfollow her lead. so here we are again, new &quot;school&quot; year beginning and I am<br/>\nstruggling with this issue again!<br/>\n<br/>\nmy biggest struggle has been trying to find things that interest her.  she<br/>\nreads very well, but doesn&#39;t particularly like to.(I am very relaxed about<br/>\nwhat she reads, I just want her to read!)  sometimes I feel like she isn&#39;t<br/>\ninterested in anything.  how do I help to spark her interest?  I sometimes<br/>\nfeel like I have just hit a roadblock with her and I don&#39;t know where to go<br/>\nfrom here.  I am very committed to homeschooling, I believe that it is best<br/>\nfor our family and ps is the last place that she would go.  I guess I am<br/>\njust looking for any advice or support with this.  does anyone else have<br/>\nthese problems with getting there children interested in things?  she<br/>\nbasically just wants to play all day, without ANY academics.<br/>\n<br/>\nany thoughts would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nthis list has been an invaluable resource for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank You,<br/>\n<br/>\nmindy<br/>\n<br/>\nmom of cameron, 4 years old and Chloe, 8 years old</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":93349703,"authorName":"Lilly","from":"Lilly &lt;hazy_lilly@...&gt;","profile":"hazy_lilly","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Yeast","postDate":"1016624740","msgId":32830,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMzIwMTE0NTQwLjM1MzY5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MTAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDIwMzE5LjAxMTkzMy4tMTQ3NjQ3LjExLmJzb2xsYXJzQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32819,"nextInTopic":42812,"prevInTime":32829,"nextInTime":32831,"topicId":13896,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, Someone in group Mention yeast overgrowth.

I don&#39;t know what you mean by a sucking<br/>\nproblem, but when I had my second child, I thought nursing would be so<br/>\nenjoyable, like with my first.  But he bit me and chomped on me.  Also,<br/>\nwherever he sucked got blisters and he too had thrush that wouldn&#39;t go<br/>\naway.  He actually was allergic to my milk because I had an overgrowth of<br/>\nyeast.  Unfortunately, I stopped nursing because I couldn&#39;t afford to go<br/>\nto the doctor (Of course, I didn&#39;t know about welfare at the time).  He<br/>\nbit because of the thrush, not because he really wanted to bite.  He also<br/>\nsucked way too hard because I think it itched or something in his mouth. <br/>\nIf I could do it again, I would buy some plain yogurt, like the kind you<br/>\nget at the health food store with no sugar, but with acidophilus and good<br/>\nbacteria cultures.  Then I would spread that around the baby&#39;s mouth,<br/>\njust like you do with Nystatin, the medicine for thrush.  I would totally<br/>\neliminate pasteurized milk, wheat and sugar from my diet, but I would eat<br/>\nthe yogurt.  I would also drink sixteen 8 oz. cups of water a day (if<br/>\npossible, with the juice of a lemon in it-yeast hate that), all before<br/>\ndinner.  I know this sounds extreme.  If you have two half-gallon<br/>\npitchers and fill them with water at night, leaving them open, by morning<br/>\nthe chlorine taste should leave it.  Then just be sure you finish them<br/>\noff by dinner time.  For your daughter, if you have a library and a vcr,<br/>\nthere are a lot of tapes she could watch.  Don&#39;t worry about giving her<br/>\neverything she needs schoolwise right now.  I learned to read watching<br/>\nthe electric company.  Read between the Lions is good for that.  I always<br/>\nsay &quot;Boredom is the soil in which imagination grows.&quot;  Give her household<br/>\nitems to play with.  Marbles, beads, beans, sticks, rocks can all teach<br/>\nmath.  Books at the library teach counting and reading-what is that one<br/>\nbook with animal-people with words by the pictures?  Libraries these days<br/>\noften have computer games that teach math and reading, if you make an<br/>\nappointment for it.  Maybe you could at least take her once or twice a<br/>\nweek?  I&#39;m not sure where you are, city or country, or what your<br/>\ntransportation is.

I admire your dedication to seeing that your baby gets the best start in her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes your 5 y.o. enjoy what she is viewing on tv?  If she is then what&#39;s the problem?  You could join her and ask her about her favorite show and what she likes about it...<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you get out to the library?  Our library also lends out computer games, board games, puzzles, etc.  Books on tape are fun for some kids?  Does she have access to art materials (paper, crayons, markers, pencils, clay, glue, scissors , etc?  Perhaps you can invite another family over to visit? <br/>\n<br/>\n Include her as much as possible in the tasks you feel are taking up all of your time.  She can sit with you while you are feeding the baby...you could play I Spy with her, read to her or just enjoy each other&#39;s company, maybe she&#39;d like to help you make food and clean?  There are a lot of wonderful treasures to be found at a Thrift store or garage sale...or for that matter, in your own backyard. ;-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAsk your daughter what it is she enjoys doing and go from there?  I am an only child and do not think I had a nonlife when mom was doing something else that took up a lot of her time.  I found all sorts of fun ways to create things and play.  I think my parents purposely stayed out of the way sometimes. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nLiving Joyfully,<br/>\nLara<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bevibrant@...\">bevibrant@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bevibrant@...\">bevibrant@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Monday, March 18, 2002 2:49 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Help!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am having such a hard time right now.

Twice since I started <br/>\nhomeschooling, I&#39;ve been striken with medical problems.  The first, <br/>\nwas the first year the girls were home.  Rachel was 11, Jenni <br/>\nwas 8 and Wyndham was 4.  I came down with Guillaume-Barre Syndrom.  I <br/>\nspent a couple of months flat on my back.  Rachel learned to cook and <br/>\nclean that year out of necessity.  I felt guilty for quite a while <br/>\nbecause I felt like I put the girls in a bad position, having to take <br/>\ncare of me, but what could I do?  <br/>\nThe second time was two and 1/2 years later, when I had a pulmonary <br/>\nembolism, followed two days later by a heart attack.  I was out of <br/>\ncommission once again for several months.  Jenni learned to make a <br/>\nreally great grilled cheese sandwich that year!<br/>\nI tell you this, not because I want you to feel sorry for us - - I <br/>\nconsider myself lucky in a way, because those problems are part of the <br/>\nreason I unschooled in the first place.  The conscious thought about <br/>\nwhat I was actually doing (regarding their education) came much later. <br/>\n Mostly, I was just so wiped that it was unschooling by default that <br/>\nfirst year.<br/>\nThis has to be even harder for you since yours are so much littler.  <br/>\nDo you have other unschooling friends she could go do stuff with <br/>\noccassionally?  My only other advice would be to talk to her as much <br/>\nas you can and keep telling her that things will not be like they are <br/>\nfor very long.  The baby will grow, you will feel better, life will be <br/>\nmore fun.  And for now, TV won&#39;t hurt her.  You could also find her <br/>\nsome cool computer games too. <br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., bevibrant@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am having such a hard time right now.
