What happens to be so terribly <br>bad about shopping the day after Thanksgiving? I feel if its done as a family <br>it can definatly be a fun thing. I personaly love to take advantage of the <br>*low* prices offered through specials the day after Thanksgiving. I have 3 <br>children and a very very limited budget so this shoping day with all its <br>specials really helps me out tremendously. Plus it&#39;s just all part of the <br>Christmas feel. Almost like snow. It just seems to me to make things more <br>Chrismasy.\n<br>But this is just my opinion of course and everyone is entitled to do their <br>*own*thing, but I feel it might be more of a crusade to protest something of <br>value instead of one shopping day a year:-)\n<br>Hope all had a wonderful Thanksgiving.....\n<br>Angela</font></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14231,"nextTopicId":14235}}
