Cuz I&#39;ll buy &#39;em off you when you&#39;re<br/>\ndone with them! I am having a very difficult time trying to get his books<br/>\nthrough the library. All copies are ALWAYS checked out. I have my name on<br/>\nthe list for one, and I hope to get it in a few days. I checked Amazon.com,<br/>\nbut some are on backorder and might be shipped in 3-5 weeks.  Some aren&#39;t<br/>\neven being printed anymore! I was hoping I wouldn&#39;t have to buy them new.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has any of his books and would be willing to lend them to me, I<br/>\nwill pay for shipping to/from, and I will treat them as if my life depended<br/>\non it!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone? (sniff, sniff)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin, <br/>\n<br/>\nI would wholeheartedly recommend buying at least one of Holt&#39;s books to have for those times when you fall into the &quot;questioning&quot; days.  It always helps to have some encouragement at home when you are doubting yourself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the books, go to the GWS site, www.holtgws.com, they have his books on hand, so you shouldn&#39;t have to wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren Mowery<br/>\n-----------<br/>\nGo confidently in the direction of your dreams.
