I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-138673198\">I am pondering this thing called raising children lately.  Sometimes I think maybe making them do anything at all is no good because then they resent it.  I think maybe attitude has alot to do with it.  Sometimes when I am cleaning up and I get a little out of control it is certainly because the house is out of control. Like today I wanted to make some hot cereal and couldn&#39;t find one, not one measuring cup.  After I got done yelling about it, one child found one out by the washer and my son 18 found my one ounce (shot glass) outside, and then my other dd remembered the other glass one was in the fridge with milk in it.  (I hung my head in shame, I put it there damn it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI made my older kids clean up with me, on Sat. Boy did everyone hate saturdays.  I made my ds 18 work so he could learn work ethics. Oh brother.  I make myself sick thinking of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started this with the others too.  But now I don&#39;t make them do anything.  I figure that possibly I ask them to do things because I don&#39;t feel like it.  If I don&#39;t feel like it then why should they have to do it.  So it goes undone until someone feels like it.  If they want a drink they have to rinse out a glass or get the one they already used that day.  Mind now this does not work if they have clean glasses in the cabinet, but if all cups are dirty they can find the cup they have been using. LOL.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude must play a role in this too.  Maybe because my mom hated housework and passed it off on us, I hate it too, and I don&#39;t want to pass this on to my kids.  I want them to do it because they want to.  I don&#39;t want them to do dishes because they are a girl or only work on cars because they are a boy.  So the house is relatively messy.  And I don&#39;t mind most days.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFact is I&#39;m not sure what gets results for help to do this or that, just that my two oldest girls can keep house, they don&#39;t do it the same way, but their houses look nice.  They take care of their houses because they want to, and when they come here they don&#39;t clean up.  They fall right back into the fold of the other sheep and let mom do it.  Kind of comforting.  I laugh about it.  Stepheny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84555,"nextTopicId":84710}}
