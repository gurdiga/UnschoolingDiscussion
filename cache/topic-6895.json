They gear everything <br/>\ntowards the older children.  Needless to say I never go to anything, because <br/>\nI don&#39;t fit! All of my friends are gearing up for preschool next year two <br/>\ndays a week. Gee, that will leave possibly 3 days that we (and our children) <br/>\nmight have a chance to connect with each other.  I sometimes wonder if these <br/>\nsame friends will continue to be my friend say 5 years down the road.  A few <br/>\nI know will, but I wonder about the others.  They seem just a little too <br/>\nexcited about the prospect of shopping, lunching, volunteering, etc. while <br/>\ntheir children are in preschool. They &quot;can&#39;t wait until preschool starts&quot;!! <br/>\nUgh!  How can anyone want to be away from their child that much?  Yes, I <br/>\nknow there are those days...but every week?<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jazballard@...\">jazballard@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] socialization- the little ones<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 1 Mar 2000 08:07:12 EST<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Michelle,<br/>\n&gt;Yes--not having anyone who can relate to what you want to do IS such a<br/>\n&gt;difficulty...<br/>\n&gt;EVERYONE here sends their kids to school, and I have yet to find a support<br/>\n&gt;group in my area....most of the people I find out about are a good 1 hr<br/>\n&gt;away..kind of hard to cultivate a relationship with a stranger that way...<br/>\n&gt;There is a group that  does activities ect, but everything is for the older<br/>\n&gt;ages...nothing for little ones really..<br/>\n&gt;So this list is my support group...although not much interaction for my<br/>\n&gt;child...<br/>\n&gt;Altleast we have each other !!!  Just knowing that I&#39;m not alone in my<br/>\n&gt;feelings certainly does ALOT for me...<br/>\n&gt;Eileen<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6890,"nextTopicId":6904}}
