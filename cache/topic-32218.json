Now it is rare to see much snow<br/>\nor extended cold here in the winters.  Just little ol&#39; me with not much<br/>\nunderstanding of science can look and observe the cars with their exhaust<br/>\nand the factories with their stinking smoke( I live by Weyerhauser) and<br/>\nthe skies filled with &quot;stuff&quot; from airplanes.  True, they are making cars<br/>\nburn cleaner and filters so the factories don&#39;t stink as often or as bad,<br/>\nbut surely it affects the air we breathe on which we depend for survival.<br/>\n And I&#39;ve heard some people defend atomic energy saying it doesn&#39;t<br/>\npollute the earth, but you have to put the waste somewhere and it takes<br/>\nvirtually forever to become harmless.  How can anyone say that makes<br/>\nsense?  Why do we all have to live with so much modern conveniences,<br/>\nanyway?  It just seems to make the world we live in so much more<br/>\ncomplicated and ugly.  It&#39;s like saying diet doesn&#39;t have any influence<br/>\non our health, which I totally disagree with.  That&#39;s just the opinion of<br/>\nlittle ol&#39; me.  <br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32212,"nextTopicId":32209}}
