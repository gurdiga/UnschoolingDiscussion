On this website you can read the journal each day and comment or<br/>\nask questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nShan<br/>\nmommy to Connor (3-15-97), Quinn (8-8-02) and Sloane (12-11-04)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.maasaioralhistories.org/\">http://www.maasaioralhistories.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most celebrated peoples of Africa, the Maasai have roamed<br/>\nthe land for centuries, ignoring the national boundaries that sprung up<br/>\naround them. But today, they are finding themselves increasingly<br/>\nrestricted and misunderstood by the modern Africa that now encircles<br/>\nthem. The traditional Maasai lifestyle is under pressure to change, as<br/>\nthe Maasai find themselves on a collision course with modern society.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Maasai Oral Histories Project will record and archive Maasai oral<br/>\nhistories, myths, rituals, stories, laws, and beliefs, which are<br/>\ntraditionally passed on by senior elders. Many recording sessions will<br/>\ntake place at local Maasai schools, in a context that allows<br/>\ninteraction between the elders and students familiar with new<br/>\ntechnology.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, the Project will be an intercultural experience for<br/>\nstudents in the United States. A classroom Study Guide has been<br/>\ndeveloped to introduce the Maasai Oral Histories Project to various<br/>\ngrade levels. Images and translated text will also be transmitted to<br/>\nour field journal during December 2004 and January 2005. The<br/>\ncombination of our Study Guide and Field Journal allows the Maasai Oral<br/>\nHistories Project to be easily integrated into existing social studies,<br/>\nAfrican studies or geography curriculum with images and text from the<br/>\nrecording sessions, along with age-relevant material to stimulate<br/>\ninteraction between Maasai and American students. If the technology and<br/>\ncircumstance allows, we will send and reply to classroom e-mail on a<br/>\ndaily basis.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3793,"nextTopicId":102610}}
