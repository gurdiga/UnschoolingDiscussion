I truly <br/>\nbelieve in Unschooling and your story sounds very familiar to mine. I played the <br/>\nschool game at home because my husband didn&#39;t want to homeschool at all so to <br/>\neven consider the unschooling idea was out of the question. My son and also <br/>\nmy 7yo dd both go to public school right now because I couldn&#39;t handle the <br/>\nstress in our house anymore. <br/>\nIt is very difficult to homeschool when you don&#39;t agree on what to do. I <br/>\nfound myself doing what was best for my husband to see results, instead of <br/>\nfocusing on my children&#39;s needs. When you unschool, many times they don&#39;t learn to <br/>\nread as early as children who go to school. You and I know that they will learn, <br/>\nbut try to explain that to your husband or to the school if you ever do put <br/>\nthem in. This is what happened to me. This all caused a lot of resentment (from <br/>\nme) toward my husband also, for not supporting homeschooling. <br/>\n       I&#39;m not sure if any of this helps, because I still don&#39;t have any <br/>\nanswers. Just thought I&#39;d tell you my story. I do believe if people would just <br/>\ntrust a Mother to make decisions about their children (if they are the ones with <br/>\nthem every day) things would work out best. A mother should make decisions <br/>\nthat are best for her children and she needs people around her to be supportive <br/>\nof her, even when she makes a mistake. I hope everything works out for you.     <br/>\n         Teresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164542605,"authorName":"Danielle Conger","from":"Danielle Conger &lt;danielle.conger@...&gt;","profile":"danielleconger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] husband just doens&#39;t get it","postDate":"1096198568","msgId":99844,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxNTZBOUE4LjEwNDA1MDhAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGUyLjFlZjQyZTEuMmU4NzhjZjJAYW9sLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGUyLjFlZjQyZTEuMmU4NzhjZjJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":99829,"nextInTopic":99852,"prevInTime":99843,"nextInTime":99845,"topicId":99829,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===How will they learn things and  know they like it if you don t introduce it.

Others may have better recommendations than that. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, here and at Sandra&#39;s site, there are lots of real person testimonials, lots of experience and wisdom, but with some folks that&#39;s just not going to carry the same kind of weight as a solid book, written by an expert. If Holt can open dh&#39;s mind and help him see *how much* kids learn, then maybe dh will be open to finding out from real unschoolers whether or not those ideas work. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&gt;--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":107520860,"authorName":"hmsclmyboy@aol.com","from":"hmsclmyboy@...","profile":"hmsclmyboy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"husband just doens&#39;t get it","postDate":"1096168178","msgId":99829,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUyLjFlZjQyZTEuMmU4NzhjZjJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":99844,"prevInTime":99828,"nextInTime":99830,"topicId":99829,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am having a really hard time getting my husband on board with the idea of unschooling.
