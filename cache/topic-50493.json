That&#39;s <br/>\nhow long I had camera, light, audio men and a producer in my house. It was <br/>\ntiring. They rearranged my entire living room and computer room. Nice as <br/>\nthey were, they put it all back right where they found everything. They were <br/>\na very nice bunch of guys. The producer was very sweet and patient. Tara was <br/>\nnervous and I just kept thinking about all the other stuff I wanted to do! <br/>\nThe 3 younger kids were great all day. They shot 4 tapes and took pictures <br/>\ntoo. All this for maybe 2 minutes of tape for the show, if that. I do <br/>\nbelieve that Tara and I will be sitting in the audience front row for the <br/>\nshow. Makes us both feel better to have all the people behind us instead of <br/>\nin front of us. Neither one of us are on stage kind of people. Tara is just <br/>\nthrilled to go. She&#39;s never been on a plane and is excited about the limo <br/>\nand the hotel and all. We get to have our makeup and hair done too on Monday <br/>\nmorning for the show. I figure maybe they&#39;ll ask us maybe one or two <br/>\nquestions and that&#39;s it. We&#39;ll be on the second half of Tuesdays show. And <br/>\nthen on the Oxygen channel for a half hour after the show. I have no idea <br/>\nwhat the tape will look like that they put together. We&#39;ll have to wait <br/>\nuntil Monday to see if we come across like insecure flakes!! You never know <br/>\nwith editing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey took some tape of me with all the kids except Joseph. He just didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to do it. I explained to him how much it would mean to me to have him <br/>\nwith us and he just didn&#39;t want to. Tara, I found out later, trying bribing <br/>\nhim and that didn&#39;t work either! So we&#39;re minus my boy unless they show a <br/>\npicture of him. He made a choice and stuck by it. I&#39;m proud of him for that. <br/>\nGotta love those choices! I mentioned homeschooling but not sure any of that <br/>\nwill get in.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I spend the next 2 days rounding up warm clothes to wear of which I have <br/>\nnone.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday was definitely a learning experience for us all.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
