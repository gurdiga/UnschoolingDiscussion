He told me (when <br/>\nTrevor was a very little guy) that when I got frustrated and angry to just <br/>\nhug my child instead of berate him.<br/>\nSo sweet.<br/>\nAnd he inspired me again a couple days ago...<br/>\nTrevor was taking my camera equipment out to the car for our resource day.<br/>\nIt was two cameras with several lenses, filters and a videocamera which had <br/>\nrecordings of Christmas, Jalens first haircut, Trevor and Jalens Birthdays <br/>\netc....<br/>\nWell, he set them on the trunk, instead of in it, and we drove of and <br/>\ndestroyed almost ALL of the equipment.<br/>\nIt made me ill.<br/>\nTen years of collecting stuff and about $2,000 down the tube in a moment.<br/>\nI was physically ill and crying. It was awful. I was so mad at first, but had <br/>\ntime to cool off  while driving around looking for parts that may have <br/>\nsurvived (after dropping the kids off at resource day)<br/>\nI remembered when I wrecked my Dads truck and how scared I was. I just KNEW I <br/>\nwas in deep S***. But when Dad sat down for &quot;the talk&quot; he just told me how <br/>\nglad he was that I didn&#39;t get hurt and that he hoped I learned something <br/>\nimportant and I&#39;d be a safer driver from that day forth.<br/>\nIt was sweet and calm, not what I had expected at all...even though he was <br/>\nalmost always sweet and calm :)<br/>\nSo I thought of that when Trevor and I were talking about my cameras.<br/>\nTrevor cried and I told him these things happen in life and it really sucks <br/>\nbecause I can&#39;t replace a lot of it, but in the end it was just stuff. And <br/>\npeople matter more than stuff and I wasn&#39;t angry at him, just sad because I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have my equipment anymore.<br/>\nHe felt so awful already, he didn&#39;t need anything to add to his misery.<br/>\nBut I thank my Dad for the inspiration to be sweet and calm in the face of a <br/>\nminor disaster. He is a good example, I&#39;m lucky to still have him.<br/>\nMy Mom died last year, I miss her terrible.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>\ngrowing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>\nmagic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>\nme....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                                    ----Frances Hodgson Burnett</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58940,"nextTopicId":58848}}
