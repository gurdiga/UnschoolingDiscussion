I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s an unschooling family or <br/>\nnot.  If anyone has anything I could forward to her, please let me know here or <br/>\non the side.  Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Sandra,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are a homeschooling family in WI.  Children are Sarah, 17;<br/>\n<br/>\nNoah, 13 (adopted from China at age 7 1/2 years); and Linnea, 12 <br/>\n<br/>\n(adopted from China, at age 9 years).  My husband was diagnosed<br/>\n<br/>\nthree weeks ago with primary amyloidosis, a rare disease which<br/>\n<br/>\nisn&#39;t cancer, but acts like cancer.  Though he has just started<br/>\n<br/>\nmassive chemo treatments, the doctor told him yesterday he believes<br/>\n<br/>\nPhil is dieing.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am losing my husband, our children are losing their father, and<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t imagine life without him.  This is a nighmare I am unable<br/>\n<br/>\nto wake up from.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if there were any other homeschool families that<br/>\n<br/>\nhave experienced this?  I can&#39;t remember if I&#39;ve read anything<br/>\n<br/>\nin HEM or not.  I know there are single parent homeschool families.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just thought I&#39;d ask.  We&#39;re not having a good day here today.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help.  -Janice Zindel, WI</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100948,"nextTopicId":100949}}
