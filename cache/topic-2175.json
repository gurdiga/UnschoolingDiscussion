We are all<br/>\n&gt;learning all the time.  What are their interests?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bake something, make something, go somewhere, clean something, read<br/>\n&gt;something-anything, take a nap-dream,<br/>\n&gt;Look up a word-something absurd, have a big bowl of ice-cream.<br/>\n&gt;Life is for learning, living, doing. How far will your imagination go?<br/>\n&gt;Be, see, climb a tree. Beyond texts there is so much to know.<br/>\n&gt;Life is an education, a journey where anything goes.<br/>\n&gt;And the only limits that slow you down are the ones that are self imposed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, the moment you stopped making them &#39;do&#39; school you were unschooling. If<br/>\n&gt;they ask a question, answer it. If they want to know something help them<br/>\n&gt;find out as much as they want your help. Include them in what you are doing<br/>\n&gt;and let them include you in what they are doing.  And once in a while let<br/>\n&gt;them sleep in!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mary in Idaho (who is feeling chatty and inspired this am, sometimes<br/>\n&gt;adversity brings out the best)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 5<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Fri, 20 Aug 1999 09:19:28 +0000<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;Jeff & Diane Gwirtz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: I need help getting started<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Jill and Lori,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think one of the easiest ways to think about unschooling is to <br/>\n&gt;think about continuing on the same path that you followed when they <br/>\n&gt;were little toddlers.  You live your life with them.  You engage them <br/>\n&gt;in things that interest you or that might interest them.  You cheer <br/>\n&gt;when they&#39;re bored because out of that boredom may come a wonderful <br/>\n&gt;idea for a new project.  One of the most helpful things we did when <br/>\n&gt;we first started was to do anything but school-like stuff.  We took a <br/>\n&gt;lot of field trips, nature walks, etc. - just celebrating the fact <br/>\n&gt;that we were free.  We read aloud until my voice was shot and then <br/>\n&gt;read some more.  We also watched tv and played video games - still <br/>\n&gt;do.  In fact yesterday  my 13 year old spent lots of time with a <br/>\n&gt;video game,  but to help him through it,  he drew a map to scale as <br/>\n&gt;the game progressed.  We have learned so much from television shows <br/>\n&gt;and games.  With unlimited tv and video games here,  my kids became <br/>\n&gt;more selective on their own.  Enjoy your kids and your family and the <br/>\n&gt;learning will come.  There will be many times that you won&#39;t be able <br/>\n&gt;to figure out where they learned what they know because with an <br/>\n&gt;unschooling lifestyle their brains seem so much more receptive to <br/>\n&gt;little snippets of info that pass others by.

When I am alone and laugh out loud, I KNOW it is funny! Not really funny in the long run, however! I taught in public schools, knowing full well that classroom education is a poor last resort for parents who just don&#39;t have time to teach their own children! I am excited now to be participating in the home education of my granddaughter. As a teacher, I participated in the search for the appropriate educational phrase for something simple. It is an ongoing thing, this search for the bafflegab that will satisfy the reader and keep him from asking more questions!

Get a<br/>\n&gt;copy of your state laws and find out what is required of you.  If it does<br/>\n&gt;not state that you are required to have a certain amt. of days or hours<br/>\n&gt;then you don&#39;t need to provide that info.  If you know that your school<br/>\n&gt;board is very thorough on looking at your portfoilo and you feel that<br/>\n&gt;they could give you extra problems by questioning everything that you do-<br/>\n&gt;maybe you should comply OR recieve counsel from the HOMESCHOOL LEGAL<br/>\n&gt;DEFENSE ASSOCIATION-  www.hslda.com.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here in Florida attendance is not required or a daily log needed , but<br/>\n&gt;they ( here in Osceola Co.) wanted a daily log and hours recorded from<br/>\n&gt;us.

Do you just list some highlights or write<br/>\n&gt;in-depth descriptions of activities?  How much material do you put in a<br/>\n&gt;portfolio? Should I start collecting it throughout the year, or just<br/>\n&gt;gather<br/>\n&gt;up things near the time when the assessment is due? <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, my school dept. required me to agree to a &quot;minimum of 900 hours of<br/>\n&gt;instruction.&quot;  How can I prove (or the school dept. disprove) that I met<br/>\n&gt;this requirement through what I write in our log?  I know my son is<br/>\n&gt;learning something every day, but my daily journal may not reflect this<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;the satisfaction of the school superintendent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;Olivia<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;___________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>\n&gt;Free software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>\n&gt;Try Juno Web: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 22<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Fri, 20 Aug 1999 18:01:19 -0700<br/>\n&gt;   From: David Albert &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shantinik@...\">shantinik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Digest Number 161<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dear Nancy --<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Glad to see you&#39;re out there!

Some of you may still have<br/>\n&gt;continued in your teaching careers; others of you may have deserted.  I<br/>\n&gt;want to know about your own teaching experiences, and what prompted you<br/>\n&gt;to teach your child(ren) at home.  Was it a difficult decision for you?<br/>\n&gt;If you continued schoolteaching, what kind of response did you get in<br/>\n&gt;the school?  Were there things which you learned in your teacher<br/>\n&gt;education that was helpful or harmful in providing a better learning<br/>\n&gt;environment for your child?  Were there things the school could have<br/>\n&gt;done differentily which would have convinced you to keep your child<br/>\n&gt;there?  What does the decision look like in hindsight (and how are your<br/>\n&gt;kids doing?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Again, I&#39;d love to receive your recollections and your thoughts on the<br/>\n&gt;subject.
