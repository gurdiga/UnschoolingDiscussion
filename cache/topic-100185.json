So, I&#39;m a toy gun toting mama, too! &lt;g&gt;.  He chose the guns because of the price and the color.  He likes red and they look like ray guns and they were only 88 cents (a bargain hunter already).  He hasn&#39;t seen holsters anywhere yet, so he probably wouldn&#39;t know what one was.  These shoot out darts, I think that was part of the appeal.  He calls them his missiles.  He did get the first ones he saw and decided to save up for one of those pirate guns at Disney World.  So, he got cheap ones now and will get the cool ones when we go this winter.   Funny, he talks to me endlessly about guns, but never mentions it to his dad unless I&#39;m around.  Interesting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBen is learning to play Magic also.  Trouble is he wants to play with his friends and none of them are learning it, he&#39;s five and plays with his hand face up for now until he learns to read the cards.  Though he can recognize words like Kraw Wurm and Alpha Myr already.  When did Kirby learn to play Magic?  We are a Magic card playing family (we all play, not much for me anymore, but dh has been playing for years) and a D/D playing family too, all of us now.  One of our friends who is really into it, (he&#39;s all time Dungeon Master when we play) they were watching Ben for us one evening.  He starting the kids on playing D/D, their 3 & 5 year old daughters and my son.  We knew it was only a matter of time before he got them into an adventure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou make a good point though.  He goes to gymnastics, and we are not a gymnastics family.  He is a separate person.

We never knew until then how she must <br/>\nhave felt about his collection of GI Joe&#39;s at our house (don&#39;t know <br/>\nwhat she did with the accessories that came with the Lego sets at <br/>\nher place.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not a gun family, either, so Joe began to play more with <br/>\nBarbie and Ariel than with his weapons when the younger siblings <br/>\ncame along -- which may or may not sound any better...  Despite my <br/>\nbest efforts to distract the kids away from the wild, wild western <br/>\nways -- Bud&#39;s younger brother, Vince, insisted upon biting his toast <br/>\n(and any other food that would serve) into the shape of a gun and <br/>\nlater &quot;invented&quot; molded paper guns of all shapes and sizes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time he went to visit his grand-dad at the family pharmacy, <br/>\nwho knew how much he loved guns and war history, he would present <br/>\nhim with a new toy water gun while he told him a story from the big <br/>\nwar (and my dad hated the army!)  Vince was in awe of a wooden gun <br/>\nat Silver Dollar City and another at Frontierland in WDW -- and when <br/>\nwe saw the excitement on his face, well, the old cowboy-n-indian <br/>\ndays resurfaced and he got his fondest wish.  <br/>\n<br/>\nVince is sixteen now and still loves guns (even taught his little <br/>\nbrother the fine art of making paper models,) along with Swiss Army <br/>\nknives, light sabers, etc.  It&#39;s definitely not our thing, and he <br/>\nknows how I feel about his older brother joining the military -- so <br/>\nwe&#39;ll see what happens.  We&#39;ve given him a chance to explore while <br/>\nunder our wings, and hopefully, he&#39;ll be better prepared to make <br/>\ngood choices on this and other matters when he leaves the nest.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a wonderful opportunity to explore your feelings on the subject <br/>\nwith both friends and family.  Right now, our kids are trying to <br/>\nfigure out how to convince the neighbor&#39;s daughter that they really <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to play &quot;dead&quot; (no guns involved) and bury her in the <br/>\nfield. She&#39;s on a kick this month -- we&#39;ll be glad when Halloween&#39;s <br/>\nover.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe local grocer put the goriest masks on display right in front of <br/>\nthe entrance so no one (including the sensitive folks like me) can <br/>\navoid them.  A couple of years ago, one of the baggers at another <br/>\nstore came over to help clean up a spill, dripping in fake blood <br/>\nhimself, and hung around while we checked out with our younger <br/>\nchildren.  I was totally grossed out and so was my husband and the <br/>\nolder kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I couldn&#39;t believe the manager hadn&#39;t sent him home with <br/>\nall that makeup, which was extreme compared to everyone else in the <br/>\nplace.  I wonder if his mom ever let him play with guns when he was <br/>\nlittle...  Anyway, I took the opportunity to share my feelings in an <br/>\ne-mail to the store afterwards, and plan to do the same with this <br/>\ngrocer concerning the costume rack at the front door.  We&#39;ll all be <br/>\nbetter for the experience, I&#39;m sure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nVayan con Dios, Amigos ~<br/>\nPenne & the Crew<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Makin&#39; a Difference from the Heart ~<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kitchencrew.ardfamilyco-op.net\">http://kitchencrew.ardfamilyco-op.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 10/3/04 5:18:04 PM, lauraj2@v... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;  So, we are a toy gun totting family.  &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, you have a toy gun toting kid.<br/>\n&gt; What one person does isn&#39;t what the whole family does.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m glad he got guns (though I think the good six-shooters would <br/>\nbe more <br/>\n&gt; satisfying gun-wise, and they can come with a belt with holsters), <br/>\nbut I wonder if <br/>\n&gt; that last line of your post wasn&#39;t indicative of part of the angst <br/>\nin the <br/>\n&gt; situation.

He did walk right up to her and tell her nice and loud, &quot;I have two new guns.&quot;  I think he heard me tell dh about her reaction.  She looked at me and rolled her eyes and shook her head.
