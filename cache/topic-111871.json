He&#39;s - confused, I suppose. Or ignorant. Sad,  <br/>\nconsidering he&#39;s responsible for both the k12 and community college  <br/>\nsystem here in California.  Public high school students can only take  <br/>\nclasses at the community college with permission of their principal/ <br/>\ncounselor who must verify that the student can benefit from &quot;college  <br/>\nlevel work.&quot; Most community college do allow some advanced high  <br/>\nschool students to take classes, but they are limited to part-time  <br/>\nenrollment and to certain courses. The college where I teach doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nnot allow high school students to take ANY course which is considered  <br/>\nremedial or one that is offered at a high school in the student&#39;s  <br/>\ndistrict.<br/>\n<br/>\nCommunity colleges are going to be thrilled that O&#39;Connell thinks  <br/>\nthey should be sort of a dumping ground for the thousands of kids who  <br/>\nfail the exit exam. Not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hmm so if they can take community college classes for a while, why<br/>\n&gt; would they need a high school diploma?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They don&#39;t. But most people don&#39;t know that and still think a high  <br/>\nschool diploma is critical to life success.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A year or two at community<br/>\n&gt; college and they would (a) be above the compulsory attendance age (b)<br/>\n&gt; be able to simply transfer to a 4 yr college or university (should<br/>\n&gt; they choose to) with not somuch concern about the diploma - unless, I<br/>\n&gt; suppose, they want to go to a state-run college/university which tends<br/>\n&gt; to be run by the same people as the high school system.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They could easily transfer - it is easier to transfer than to get in  <br/>\nas a freshman, in fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are ways to go to college full time before turning 18,  <br/>\nhomeschoolers do it, but these are the kids who could NOT pass the  <br/>\nhigh school exit exam and are not going to be the ones who qualify  <br/>\nfor full-time college enrollment at 16 or 17 years old. Lots are not  <br/>\ngoing to be interested in college, even.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe homeschoolers know a lot about what they could do, as  <br/>\nalternatives, but their parents would have to be on the same page.  <br/>\nFor example, they can start their own private school or they can  <br/>\nenroll in a private independent study program. Some of us with  <br/>\nprivate schools would be willing to graduate them almost immediately.  <br/>\nBut - the parents don&#39;t know there are alternatives and when they  <br/>\nhear about them they are often suspicious that we&#39;re wrong - declare  <br/>\nyourself to be a private school and give the kid a diploma? Sounds  <br/>\ntoo easy to be true.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244360311,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;soggyboysmom@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"CA high school exit exam in the news","postDate":"1139502544","msgId":111871,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRzZnFrZys2ZDRnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":111893,"prevInTime":111870,"nextInTime":111872,"topicId":111871,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060209/ap_on_re_us/exit_exam_lawsuit One quote struck me in the article: O Connell has said that students who fail the exam can","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1653493877\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060209/ap_on_re_us/exit_exam_lawsuit\">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060209/ap_on_re_us/exit_exam_lawsuit</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOne quote struck me in the article:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;O&#39;Connell has said that students who fail the exam can take another <br/>\nyear of high school, get extra tutoring, enroll in summer school or <br/>\nattend community college until they pass.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm so if they can take community college classes for a while, why <br/>\nwould they need a high school diploma?
