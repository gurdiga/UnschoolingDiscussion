We use spanking<br/>\n  along with other consequences.  I do not hit my children, there is a<br/>\n  difference &gt;&gt;<br/>\nHi all,<br/>\nI am new to this topic because my computer has been down, but I wanted to add <br/>\nmy 2 cents worth here. ...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our house, we do not hit/spank our children.  We are replacing the word <br/>\nspank with hit because they are both the same action, no matter what the <br/>\nintent is behind it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel I can not teach my children to control themselves, obeying the rules, <br/>\nor not to hit others, by striking them myself, no matter what my intentions <br/>\nare.  It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  Have my children been hit/spanked, <br/>\nyes.  Sadly enough, they have.  I reget it deeply. I am struggling to <br/>\novercome the ways of my own childhood.  I am always looking for my parenting <br/>\ntools for my tool bag.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, just my 2 cents worth....<br/>\nHappy Mothering,<br/>\nJulie <br/>\nMommy to Ali and Matthew, Wife to a Great Man, Adam<br/>\nPlease check out a few of my  favorite sites:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mothering.com\">http://www.mothering.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.AttachmentParenting.org\">http://www.AttachmentParenting.org</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LaLecheLeague.org\">http://www.LaLecheLeague.org</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.org\">http://www.naturalchild.org</a><br/>\n&quot;It helps me to remember that people are more important than ideas and that <br/>\nbeing kind is more important than being right.&quot; <br/>\n-Peggy O&#39;Mara, Publisher of Mothering Magazine.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10269,"nextTopicId":10344}}
