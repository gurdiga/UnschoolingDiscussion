Both boys are always still up and going at that time if I let them, I usually send them to bed around 10-10:30ish so they&#39;ll be asleep before I pass out. They both fall asleep within 5-10 minutes, so I know they&#39;re tired. They never protest or ask to stay up longer. No matter what time they go to bed, they&#39;re up by 6:30 am, have been since they were a year old. I can&#39;t let them stay up alone, they just get into fights and end up hurting each other, and they get so loud they wake everyone else up. They will also go outside, and that scares me.

This could be in your children&#39;s room, or in the living room, or by  your room, with the door open, for instance, and a gate blocking the stairs, even a young child could be left to play while mom and dad slept in the adjoining room.  That way you could monitor fights. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m more concerned about their going out at night alone.  That would worry me.  Perhpas you need to make clear that you are willing to allow them to stay up and play, but not if they go outside/fight.  That if they do that they need to stay in their room(s)? Yes that is limiting, but I&#39;m not totally against limits.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if they aren&#39;t protesting your sending them up then perhaps it really isn&#39;t limiting them in anyway. Perhaps it feels good to them in some way.  I know there are those who would protest that, however, your children aren&#39;t putting up a fight, or beg for just one moment.  Maybe they like how things are.<br/>\n<br/>\nbe well,<br/>\nRachel Ann<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Myranda <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, October 16, 2002 2:20 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] limits<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  OK, let the advice come! &lt;bg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bedtimes - We have no set bedtimes, but DH and I both start our days at 6 am.
