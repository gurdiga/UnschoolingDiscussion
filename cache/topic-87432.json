I&#39;ve seen occupational therapists use it, so why not? Put that way, and Paul didn&#39;t have a problem with it.

We do a lot of driving to different <br/>\nplaces and take lots of cool trips. It&#39;s not about having things in your <br/>\nbackyard--okay, it&#39;s not *only* about having things in your backyard. &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live about 40 min. outside of DC, on the Western Shore of the Chesapeake <br/>\nBay. We have the best of both worlds, in my opinion. There are many great <br/>\nmuseums and historical sites within a 3 hour drive, but much of the stuff <br/>\nthat we do on a daily basis is local. The Chesapeake is rich in fossils. We <br/>\ncan take a 2 mile hike in the woods to get to a great beach where we can go <br/>\nfossil hunting and enjoy a beautiful day outside. We have nature walks <br/>\nthrough cypress swamp lands nearby, and the beach and boardwalk are a half <br/>\nmile drive from our home.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our backyard, we have a really great pond, stocked with comets and koi. <br/>\nIt attracts tons of frogs, dragonflies and the occasional box turtle. We <br/>\nmaintain bird feeders, which are such a joy! We get Carolina Chickadees, <br/>\nJuncos, Cardinals, Blue Jays, Titmice, Nuthatches, House Wrens, House <br/>\nFinches, Gold Finches, Downy Woodpeckers, Red Bellied Woodpeckers, Yellow <br/>\nShafted Flickers and the occasional Eastern Blue Bird. We back up against <br/>\ndeciduous woodlands and wetlands, and we occasionally see a Pileated <br/>\nWoodpecker out there. Within a short drive there&#39;s a whole host of <br/>\ndifferent birds--water birds that are amazingly graceful to watch. Last <br/>\nyear, we watched a mating dance between two Yellow Shafted Flickers, and it <br/>\nwas very cool! I love my birds!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I&#39;d give up all this nature to be closer to the city. Nature <br/>\nis just too important to me. We drive, and enjoy it all!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87725,"nextTopicId":87756}}
