Its actually funny at times. Brianna asked me the other night as I was working on my &quot;homework&quot; (graduate school) if I could show her what I was doing. It was on bond pricing. Lots of math. My first instinct was to say - well its a bit hard - but luckily I didn&#39;t ;-) and explained the very basic idea and she smiled, looked a little bored, asked a few questions about why I liked the class, what I am learning etc. Told me that she liked to do her &quot;math&quot; as cooking. We talked a bit about that, and how measuring and fractions were important when cooking, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow if I ever set out to &quot;show&quot; fractions and measuring as part of a curriculum - she may never have the interest enough to make these connections. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt really sometimes is that basic things of life that spark great conversations. <br/>\n<br/>\nSewing is another great example. I set out to learn how to sew...bought a sewing machine, got a simple pattern for a skirt and got started. As I was all spread out on the floor trying to figure it all out, I was having a bit of trouble understanding the pattern(yes, why is it that one can be an ace at bond pricing - and be clueless when it comes to patterns ;-) In any case it seems Brianna has a knack for figuring these out...&quot;Look mom, you only don&#39;t have to fold it when it has a nap...&quot; She referred to an old sewing book borrowed from my mother - looked up the definition of nap - said &quot;Oh like velvet. Well, you don&#39;t have that so you fold yours and put the pattern pieces on like this picture&quot;. Needless to say she was right, and has since made herself a pillowcase and a bookbag.

Unschooling is unlike  school in <br/>\nlolst of ways, and one way that people forget about is that school  will no longer <br/>\ntell you when&#39;s a good time to get up or sleep, to do homework or  not, to <br/>\nstudy Japan or do a science project or not.  Different reasons will  come into <br/>\nplay.  <br/>\n <br/>\nYou said it doesn&#39;t bother you, but your whole post seems to say it DOES  <br/>\nbother you.<br/>\nFeel your feelings as honestly as you can.  What bothers you bothers  you for <br/>\nsome personal reason.  Think about why that is.  Spend  extra time now that <br/>\nyou&#39;re moving toward a whole new way of being on reviewing  your own childhood <br/>\nmemories and experiences and emotions.  The better you  really know your own <br/>\nself, the more relaxed you can be with little internal  fears come up.  Don&#39;t <br/>\nlet them surprise you.

Stop peddling and the  bike <br/>\ncan fall over.  Hesitation doesn&#39;t get you farther faster, confidence  does.  <br/>\nAnd your confidence in unschooling will come from seeing it work, so  don&#39;t <br/>\nsabotage your progress.   Deschooling for a ten year old  shouldn&#39;t be looked at <br/>\nbefore five or six months have passed, and five or six  months of real <br/>\nexpectation that unschooling can work.

Dh and I both got shoved through the cattle shoot of &quot; high school then you must go to college and keep up with the Jonses&quot;  Dh and I both dropped out of college the first year. Dh plays video games constantly!!!! He has for years. With the exception of Final fantasy I just dont care for them and dont really understand his passion for them. <br/>\nAnyway one day during a 7 month lay off we had 2 years ago I got really frustrated with dh&#39;s seemingly constant game playing and said something like if you like games so much why dont you make a career out of it. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo here it is 2 years later and he just got a promotion that gave him a 50% raise...we are nowhere near rich but its kinda nice to no longer qualify for food stamps . He is also in school <br/>\nfor programming and has ideas for designs of new video games. <br/>\n <br/>\nI cant help but wonder though.........this game intrest has been going on since he was young. I cant help but wonder if he had been allowed to pursue his intrests at a much younger age instead of being shoved into courses because &quot; it was good for him&quot; Maybe he would have already gotten on the road he is on now. <br/>\n <br/>\nNicole<br/>\n<br/>\ncarolyn6522 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:csraper@...\">csraper@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been unschooling for just three months.
