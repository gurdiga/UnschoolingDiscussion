Ask him calmly and sweetly.   Make him an ally, not an <br/>\n&gt; enemy.  Tell <br/>\n&gt; him you want the house to be safe and comfortable for <br/>\n&gt; everyone there, and <br/>\n&gt; what can you do so that he&#39;s not being so frustrated he needs to hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have been trying to keep this in mind...I really am on his side and I have <br/>\nbeen trying to parent this way. I have asked him for some suggestions before<br/>\nand gotten the infamous &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. We have talked about hitting other <br/>\ninanimate objects like pillows (they are too soft) or arms of couches (that<br/>\nwon&#39;t work because it has to have skin and bones LOL!).<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you say &quot;You don&#39;t need to hit&quot; it&#39;s in the range of <br/>\n&gt; telling someone <br/>\n&gt; something doesn&#39;t hurt, or they&#39;re not hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am usually pretty good about this as it is a pet peeve of mine. I try to stay<br/>\naway from telling him that he does or does not feel a certain way (other then<br/>\nto ask questions about how he is feeling).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Instead of time out, maybe consider a walk (or a jog) with one of the <br/>\n&gt; parents.  Get hiim away from his brother, out of the house, <br/>\n&gt; maybe even out of <br/>\n&gt; the yard or neighborhood, and when the adrenaline is out and <br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s once again <br/>\n&gt; NOT in the irritating presence of the usurper (firstborns <br/>\n&gt; will know what I <br/>\n&gt; mean), he will be his best self again and can express to a <br/>\n&gt; sympathetic parent <br/>\n&gt; how he&#39;s feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>HeHeHe. I am a firstborn so we have the bases covered here (dh is a second <br/>\nborn). One of the things that has helped is that I talk about how I sometimes<br/>\nresented my little brother. That I used to hit him, but learned other ways<br/>\nas I got older. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If IN the presence of his &quot;replacement,&quot; he is told he is BAD <br/>\n&gt; and WRONG to <br/>\n&gt; resent the new kid, and that the new kid&#39;s rights are far <br/>\n&gt; greater than HIS <br/>\n&gt; badboy oldest child rights, things will probably get worse <br/>\n&gt; before they get <br/>\n&gt; better.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope that is actually one thing that I have done right. :o) I have<br/>\nalways been open to his feelings about Kyle and let him know that <br/>\nit is ok to not always like him. I also talk about how I didn&#39;t like<br/>\nall the time my little brother took when he was born. He has told me<br/>\nmany things that he does not like about Kyle. The funny thing is that <br/>\none time I was asking him if he wanted another little sister or brother<br/>\n(we are just about sure we are done, but I wanted to get his take on<br/>\nit). He said no, Kyle is enough. I then asked him if he would rather<br/>\nhave mommy and daddy to himself and he said no, that he liked having<br/>\nKyle around. And I believe him...Kyle is a built-in playmate and Jason<br/>\nloves to have someone to play with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If they have favorite shows, make sure each knows the other <br/>\n&gt; wants to watch <br/>\n&gt; whatever that is.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We have TIVO, so all favorite shows are available at all times.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Between and around those, help them negotiate case by case.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, they seem pretty good with alternating shows. Sometimes I will<br/>\npoint out how cranky Kyle (usually in the evenings) and that it<br/>\nmight help him calm down to be able to watch his shows. Works sometimes.<br/>\nJason has also recently begun to &quot;sell&quot; a show to Kyle...&quot;hey Kyle...<br/>\ndo you want to watch junkyard wars, they crash up neat cars&quot;. Kyle is<br/>\nactually very agreeable if you ask first, but if you just try to change<br/>\nthe show he digs in. Guess that will teach itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; What we do with computers is whoever&#39;s on can stay on until <br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s done, but <br/>\n&gt; there are occasional exceptions.  Sometimes someone just <br/>\n&gt; needs to check <br/>\n&gt; e-mail.

Then throughout the day, like every hour or two, wander through or look up and ask, are you both remembering to be nice and not hit? This gives lots of reminders, with the focus being on acting nice to others. We have a reward system set up. I give my boys a foam heart cutout whenever they go an hour or two without the undesirable behavior, and they have a list of things they can choose from to trade their hearts in to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nSharing tv/computer time: My oldest son get the computer in the mornings between breakfast and lunch, and my youngest gets it between lunch and supper. Opposite times with the TV. That way I&#39;m not having to keep up with whose turn it is, and they&#39;re both busy so they&#39;re not argueing about what the other&#39;s choices are. Plus before breakfast and after supper are my computer times and the tv is off those times. They&#39;ve both gotten to where they usually ignore both the tv and the computer, but when they do want to do/watch something, they know when they can or can&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi again! Just realized that there are 2 &quot;Stephanie&quot;s on the list, so I guess that I<br/>\n  will start signing with my last initial to avoid confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was hoping that people might give me some input on how they would handle<br/>\n  the following situations in an &quot;unschooling&quot; way. I have found that in the past<br/>\n  I have been good about seeing my kids point of view and trying to be respectful<br/>\n  in my discipline. There are certain areas where I seem to be at a loss and tend<br/>\n  to fall back on more traditional methods of punishments...any suggestions would<br/>\n  be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My biggest problem lately has been hitting. Some days the boys (5 and 2) get along great. Some<br/>\n  not so great. Seems to be a couple of reasons why they hit...boredom, not getting what<br/>\n  they want and revenge (either towards each other or towards me). Obviously hitting<br/>\n  is not acceptable, but what to do about it? If I physically remove Jason (which is<br/>\n  what I usually do) he starts crying about how I hurt him and putting it all back on<br/>\n  me). If I try to talk with him about what he did and how it made Kyle feel, he tunes<br/>\n  me out (very obviously...which also pushes my buttons). Do I just focus on the reason<br/>\n  for the hitting? If so, how exactly (if they are bored I do something with them, but<br/>\n  the other reasons I am not so sure what to do). Dh is very sensitive to this, as he <br/>\n  was the youngest of two boys and his older brother picked on him. DH wants a specific<br/>\n  punishment...either a time out or being sent to his room (neither of which really <br/>\n  works as it turns into a power struggle with Jason running around to prove that we can&#39;t<br/>\n  make him - which *really* pushes dh&#39;s buttons. Not fun).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Another thing that has become an issue is the sharing of the tv and computer. Now that <br/>\n  we have no restrictions, what is a fair way of doing this? The tv is a little easier,<br/>\n  I usually have them alternate shows (they actually enjoy a lot of the same shows, it is<br/>\n  just the 2 yo is absolutely hooked on Robotica and that is all he wants to watch and Jason<br/>\n  gets bored with it). I feel like I am controlling how they do this, but I also feel that<br/>\n  I have to be more involved since Kyle is only 2. The computer is a little trickier<br/>\n  as there is usually no good start/stop point. In the past, I have usually not made them<br/>\n  share...if one had something, the other could ask for it or offer something in trade<br/>\n  but it was up to the one being asked if he wanted to share it. The computer<br/>\n  has been harder however, as Jason would sometimes stay on it for hours and Kyle can <br/>\n  be very persistent and not be distracted (and often starts screaming). I guess that I<br/>\n  reach a point when I wonder if it is too unfair to Kyle to let Jason determine when he<br/>\n  gets to play all the time (Kyle usually will not initiate playing on the computer but<br/>\n  will want to play when he sees Jason playing). But then it is also unfair to Jason to <br/>\n  let Kyle get his way all the time just because he is the baby. SO then I get into <br/>\n  making the call again.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway...just looking for some input, hoping to get some insight or to be able to see things<br/>\n  in a different way.
