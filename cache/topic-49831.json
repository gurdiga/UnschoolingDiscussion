I think those who sincerely want unschooling are<br/>\nthe ones who would take such a test to heart. And those are the ones I think<br/>\nwho can get unschooling.

I think the way people explain unschooling has<br/>\nevolved from the AOL days. There are things that are expressed regularly<br/>\nthat people hadn&#39;t thought to express before. (Or maybe it&#39;s just *my*<br/>\nunderstanding that&#39;s grown and I see things in a different way!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI see people trying to express more of what unschooling is when it was more<br/>\nheavily focused on what it wasn&#39;t before.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think it&#39;s no where near where it could be. There are still things<br/>\nabout unschooling -- or more probably about getting people unstuck from the<br/>\nschoolish mindset -- that people can&#39;t find words for. And it *is*<br/>\nmisleading. People can come away with the wrong idea of what unschooling is.<br/>\nLike there&#39;s still a huge gulf between the letting kids play and being<br/>\ninvolved in their lives aspects of unschooling. Letting kids be and<br/>\nproviding a rich environment for them. Child led and parent strewn. The only<br/>\nway to grasp how the seemingly opposite aspects can both be true is to read<br/>\nbits and pieces of people&#39;s unschooling lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately it&#39;s more meaningful to be presented the evidence/stories and to<br/>\ndraw your own conclusions, but school tends to train that ability out of<br/>\npeople :-/ It&#39;s no wonder people go looking for others to tell them what to<br/>\ndo when so much of what society says is &quot;right&quot; means ignoring the obvious<br/>\nconclusions about what we&#39;re seeing, like it being the right thing to do to<br/>\nwalk away from a child crying at the door of preschool.

Unschooling doesn&#39;t have right notes.<br/>\nYou can&#39;t buy a specific something (the right notes/product) to get a<br/>\nspecific result (a particular song/math skills). Unschooling has theory. And<br/>\neveryone needs to first understand the theory then figure out what that<br/>\nlooks like given their particular children with their particular interests<br/>\nand personalities.

I enjoy discussing unschooling but if<br/>\npeople take away ideas that make whatever they&#39;re doing better for their<br/>\nkids, then that&#39;s a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful to people trying to get unschooling to talk<br/>\nabout &quot;whatever works for your family&quot; style of homeschooling.

(Alice&#39;s restaurant refered to in the<br/>\nsong was called The Wooden Spoon I think.) It&#39;s down an alley and not<br/>\n&quot;around the back&quot; as in the song.

I resented having to ask for <br/>\npermission to go to the bathroom.  Once, as a high school senior, I <br/>\nasked for permission to go to the bathroom, and the teacher <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Are you sure you have to?&quot;  I resented not having time to do <br/>\nthings I liked because I had all kinds of homework to do.  I felt <br/>\nlike I was in a prison. (I was.)  Now, if I had parents who didn&#39;t <br/>\nmake me go to schol, I wouldn&#39;t have gone.  If my parents hadn&#39;t done <br/>\nanything at all to encourage my interests outside of school, I still <br/>\nwould have been happier outside of school.  My brother felt similarly <br/>\nto me about school, but instead of sticking it out like I did, he <br/>\ndropped out.  My parents didn&#39;t do a lot to encourage his natural <br/>\ninterests (not that they didn&#39;t care about him, but because they <br/>\nthought being a good parent meant trying to figure out how to get him <br/>\nto go to school and be responsible).  Yet, he taught himself all <br/>\nkinds of valuable things that led to an interesting college major.  <br/>\n(music! lol)  Would my brother have been better off if my mom had <br/>\nbeen interested in his guitar playing and tried to provide all kinds <br/>\nof interesting things for him, driving him places, buying him new <br/>\nmusic, etc.?  Probably.  But if the choice is only between going to <br/>\nschool or not going to school and being left to oneself, I would pick <br/>\nbeing left to oneself.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I think that when someone doesn&#39;t go to school and <br/>\nis basically neglected by the parents (especially at a younger age), <br/>\na lot of emotional issues can develop.  i don&#39;t think this is a good <br/>\nsituation at all.  But a lot of emotional issues can develop from <br/>\ngoing to school too.  At least the child is free.  There are no <br/>\ntruancy officers at the door ready to escort him to school if he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t feel like going, there is no screaming because the parents <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to pay truancy fines.  There are no phone calls from the <br/>\nschool wondering where the child is.  There is no stigma of bad <br/>\ngrades on a permanent record if the child didn&#39;t feel like doing <br/>\nhours of homework at night to get good grades.  The child has a <br/>\nchance, at least, to make something of himself instead of submitting <br/>\nto school&#39;s desire to mold him into something he is not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] was: encouraging a child to stick with it, now musical personality","postDate":"1037458171","msgId":49896,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5LjI2OWFlYWJkLjJiMDdiNGZiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49892,"nextInTopic":49918,"prevInTime":49895,"nextInTime":49897,"topicId":49831,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/16/02 7:25:05 AM, fetteroll@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-996435439\">In a message dated 11/16/02 7:25:05 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  Everyone will be able to get unschooling<br/>\n(and music) to a more or less degree.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you really believe that everyone can get unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m totally willing to withdraw the music idea.
