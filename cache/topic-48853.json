Eventually if the kids want to travel, that will<br/>\n&gt; probably be a necessity. Many countries require certain immunizations<br/>\n&gt; for entrance.

I<br/>\n&gt; thought it wasn&#39;t mandated that to travel you needed vaccines unless<br/>\n&gt; going to a part of a country that may have very poor sanitary<br/>\n&gt; conditions. Can&#39;t military people get out of being vaccinated?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mary B<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote> Everyone, including military personnel can avoid being vaccinated.<br/>\nAs for travel vaccines, they aren&#39;t really necassary if you keep <br/>\nhealthy and take precautions. I&#39;ve been all over Europe, India, <br/>\nSouth East Asia and Central America without a single jab.<br/>\nSome countries require proof of yellow fever vaccination as a <br/>\ncondition of entry - some African ones - but a health certficate from <br/>\na US/UK doc or a fake vaccintaion cert works just as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I know a fair bit about US vaccination requirements is <br/>\ncos me and the kids had our immigration visa turned down <br/>\nbecause we are non-vaccinated and we had to obtain a waiver. This <br/>\nmeant months of research into US law on vaccinations. Grrrrrrrr<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile vaccines are not *as* toxic to an adult, mainly because of <br/>\nbody size there are numerous documented cases of death, <br/>\nparalysis, ill-health etc after a shot for adults.<br/>\nI&#39;d avoid &#39;em all.<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You laugh at me because I&#39;m different.

I think she&#39;s had it but its another very mild disease in that <br/>\nthere is a slight or no temp rise and a very mild rash.

I think there&#39;s a huge difference in choosing vaccines <br/>\nselectively in bigger/older children, and sticking newborn babes full <br/>\nof 10 different vaccines in huge doses.<br/>\nPlus, DH and I love to travel and thus have been innoculated against <br/>\njust about everything as we&#39;ve been to several continents.
