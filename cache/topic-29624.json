I missed the age of your son but I have $.02 to throw in the mix. I&#39;d let him read The Teenage Liberation Handbook if he *thinks* he wants to return to school. Going to school to be with your friends is kinda lame imo because you don&#39;t really get to *do* much with them and there&#39;s very little interaction.  It would be great if your ds could develop a friendship with someone outside of the system, like a mentor, but until he discovers what his interests are, this would be a little hard to do.<br/>\nCan you get him involved in volunteering so that he has some social interaction outside the home? Maybe if you replace that &#39;loss&#39;, he&#39;d prefer to unschool afterall.<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":89240901,"authorName":"groundhoggirl","from":"groundhoggirl &lt;groundhoggirl@...&gt;","profile":"groundhoggirl2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] New to this.

I am a former <br/>\npublic high school teacher, however.  I&#39;ll tell you what I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that what you are going to have to go through will require <br/>\na lot of patience on your part.  There will be a long period of time <br/>\nwhere he will appear to be doing nothing at all except maybe watching TV <br/>\nfor hours on end.  Or, maybe he will choose to read or play computer <br/>\ngames instead.  Who knows what he will choose?  Well, maybe you do, <br/>\nsince you&#39;re his mother.  He will have to go through a process, or <br/>\nperiod of time, call &quot;deschooling&quot;.  This means that you basically just <br/>\nallow him to do what he wishes.  This may last a couple of years, or <br/>\nmore.  The theory, however, is that he will find his own way and choose <br/>\nto learn what is important to him.  And, what he chooses to learn, he <br/>\nwill learn VERY WELL.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a former public school teacher, I highly recommend you do not put him <br/>\nback in school, especially if he is an auditory learner.  I am assuming, <br/>\nof course, that he doesn&#39;t want to go back either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that institutionalized education is very harmful to <br/>\nchildren of any age.  It does not respect the individual and produces <br/>\nvery passive students.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to add, however, that, certainly, if a child wishes to go <br/>\nto school s/he should be allowed to do so and come to their own decision <br/>\nwhether it is for them or not.  I definitely feel this way with regard <br/>\nto older children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I have helped a little bit.  I&#39;m sure someone else, with more <br/>\nexperience, will be more helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Friday, December 7, 2001, at 08:07 PM, dawnasoo wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I do not want my son to go back to public school!!
