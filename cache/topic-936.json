I have been totally unable to keep up with the outrageous amount <br/>\nof postings on this list, but I did catch the last few and feel a need to <br/>\ntalk.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing raised as many of us were, in a box, being fed predigested information, <br/>\nit is hard for us to not try to define the undefinable.  We cannot define our <br/>\nchildren, or unschooling, we can only facilitate (liking that word a bunch) <br/>\nour children&#39;s growing and learning and our own growing and learning.  Formal <br/>\nstuff comes in when it needs to, relaxing happens as it needs to.  It all <br/>\nhappens as it needs to, in due time.  Perfection has not been met yet by us <br/>\nearthlings and there is no such thing as absolute or total when it comes to <br/>\nour chosen way of raising our children.  We will all make mistakes, we will <br/>\nall make changes, we will contstantly grow and learn ourselves.  And we will <br/>\nindeed continue to waste our time trying to define the undefinable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo let&#39;s join hands, closing our mouths, and opening our hearts to what each <br/>\nof us, every one of us, has chosen as a way of life.  Take comfort in our <br/>\nsimilar beliefs and feel secure that we are in a place where we are truly <br/>\nunderstood and left unjudged by each other.  We all share a connection here <br/>\nthat unfortunately, so many other parents are missing out on.  We all feel <br/>\nit, we all take great comfort in it.  Finally, someone understands how we <br/>\nthink and feel, and we are safe here.  Some of us have journeyed so far to <br/>\nget here.  And so many us need reassurance and encouragement to maintain our <br/>\nstronghold on the undefined, yet completely natural, path we have chosen.  <br/>\nSome of us have a new feeling of freedom, and are not sure how to take that <br/>\nleap off of the cliff just yet and are here to get a much needed push.<br/>\n<br/>\nWherever each one of us are on our journey... let&#39;s not let go of each <br/>\nothers&#39; hands.  Let&#39;s not section off, or correct each others&#39; words (how <br/>\nhumiliating and &quot;school-like&quot;).  Let&#39;s continue to embrace each other with <br/>\nall of our faults and attributes in tow.  Let&#39;s keep our minds open to what <br/>\neach other is experiencing and living and learning.  Something we have been <br/>\nwishing and hoping for from our own families, communities, and government, <br/>\nyet we have been guilty of doing it to own &quot;community&quot; here on this list, is <br/>\nnot keeping our minds open and our mouths shut.  let us resolve to encourage <br/>\nand build up our fellow unschoolers, and school at homers, and classic <br/>\nhomeschoolers, and ecclectic homeschoolers, and religous homeschoolers, and <br/>\nprepackaged cirric. homeschoolers, and... well ,you get the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, this forum is for those of us who learn outside of the box.

We have stepped <br/>\nout here and found a beautiful world in which we all have room to learn, grow <br/>\nand live.  We must become content to just &quot;be&quot; here and not waste time trying <br/>\nto figure out what &quot;here&quot; is.  Enjoy, embrace, love, live this wonderful life <br/>\nyou have chosen for you and your children.  Isn&#39;t it beautiful?<br/>\n<br/>\nA neighbor and I were talking about my garden.
