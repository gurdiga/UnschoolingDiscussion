After all, now I am &quot;out of the box&quot;<br/>\n&gt; because of home/unschooling, and I feel empowered to make that birth<br/>\n&gt; experience more what I had hoped the first one would have been.

The same with nursing, which became a<br/>\n&gt; struggle I gave up because I didn&#39;t have any support. Now I know many other<br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers to whom I could turn for advice and encouragement in this<br/>\n&gt; regard. I guess this is not a valid reason for having a second child, but<br/>\n&gt; it is still in my heart: I would like to have another child and do things<br/>\n&gt; the way I want this time, in light of my empowered viewpoint. I now feel<br/>\n&gt; strong enough to speak up for myself instead of just going along.<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, I was raised in a very conventional setting, and I was not<br/>\n&gt; so enlightened when I had my son; I was a stressed, overprotective,<br/>\n&gt; mainstream mom when he was born. I envy those who got out of the box prior<br/>\n&gt; to having their children.

On the other hand, I also<br/>\n&gt; firmly believe in giving a home to those children already born who are in<br/>\n&gt; need of love and a home. So adoption is very much on my mind also. I would<br/>\n&gt; love to hear from other homeschooling families who have adopted while<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling to hear of their experiences.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I usually don&#39;t post my personal thoughts here, but these issues are on my<br/>\n&gt; mind right now, and your email and those of others have prompted me to<br/>\n&gt; share.
