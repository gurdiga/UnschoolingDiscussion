It&#39;s not<br/>\ntangy like the Hain vegan mayonnaise. It&#39;s very mild=at least we think so.<br/>\nWhen we make our own, we use this recipe:<br/>\n<br/>\nTofu Mayonnaise:<br/>\n<br/>\n3/4 cup soft or medium tofu (the best kind to use for this is by Mori<br/>\nNu-usually found in the Asian grocery section doesn&#39;t have to be chilled)<br/>\n<br/>\n2 tbsp lemon juice OR vinegar<br/>\n1/2 tsp salt<br/>\ndash of pepper (optional-I don&#39;t use it)<br/>\n2 tbsp oil<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a blender or food processor (I use my food processor) blend together on<br/>\nhigh, the tofu, lemon juice, salt, pepper-if using, and oil until thick and<br/>\ncreamy. Adjust any ingredients for desired taste. Store in the refrigerator<br/>\nin a clean, dry container with a tight fitting lid. Will keep for 7-10 days.<br/>\nMakes about 1 1/2 cups.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, let me know if there are any other things you are trying to use vegan<br/>\nreplacements for. I have so many recipes that it would be impossible for me<br/>\nto send them all.
