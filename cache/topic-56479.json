My children were SOOO","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-602120255\">I must confess that before I discovered unschooling, we used The Well-Trained Mind.  I now politely refer to it as The Well-Fried Mind.  My children were SOOO stressed trying to follow this method!!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey start Latin in 3rd grade and my oldest was drowning within 6 months from the intensive English, Math, and Latin requirements, as well as their requirements for a chronological study of History and then Science as well, plus Art, Music & Bible requirements.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy children would start their day at 8 am and we were lucky if we had everything finished by 4 pm.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was NOT what I started homeschooling for!!!  They were soon crying when it was time to do school! :(  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might work for some, but it certainly didn&#39;t work for my kids.  They needed to seriously de-school before they even wanted to tackle anything remotely &quot;educational&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe MHEA Conference in Maryland (my state!) is the 5th of April and it&#39;s predominantly an unschooling conference and they&#39;re having Jessie Wise as their guest speaker this year (the co-author of The Well-Trained Mind).  I&#39;m wondering how it&#39;s going to work out!!!  ::ducking in advance::<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, January 26, 2003 5:13 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] TWTM--quotes about unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 1/26/03 2:29:09 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:julie@...\">julie@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; If you end up in a local group of unschoolers and you want to <br/>\n  follow the curriculum we&#39;ve outlined in this book, you&#39;ll probably <br/>\n  need to switch groups. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry.

It assumes that the child will learn all that she <br/>\nneeds to know by following her natural impulses and that any <br/>\nlearning that is &quot;imposed&quot; on the child by an authority figure will <br/>\nprove unproductive.<br/>\n<br/>\nClassical education is knowledge-focused, not child-focused. it <br/>\nattempts to teach knowledge in a way that awakens the child&#39;s <br/>\ninterest, but the child&#39;s interest is not the sole determining factor <br/>\nin whether or not a subject should be followed. How does a child <br/>\nknow whether something will interest and excite her unless she <br/>\nworks at unfamiliar (and perhaps intimidating) material to find <br/>\nout what it&#39;s all about?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers also tend to denigrate &quot;book&quot; learning in favor of <br/>\n&quot;real&quot; learning. Many unschoolers claim that day-to-day realities <br/>\nof family life provide plenty of opportunities for learning. for these <br/>\nunschoolers, taking care of the house, grocery shopping, <br/>\ncooking, car repair, working in the family business, writing <br/>\nthank-you notes, and so on provide enough opportunity for <br/>\nchildren to learn real-life skills without &quot;doing school&quot; om a <br/>\nformal way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile this may be true, a child&#39;s education shouldn&#39;t be limited to <br/>\n&quot;real life skills.&quot; Classically educated children should be able to <br/>\ncook, write thank-you notes and tie their shoes. They also know <br/>\nwhere their country came from, how to construct a logical <br/>\nargument, and what puella means.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers claim that students who aren&#39;t forced to learn <br/>\nmathematics tables in third grade can pick them up in a day <br/>\nonce they hit sixth or seventh grade and get interested on their <br/>\nown. In our experience, the student who doesn&#39;t learn the math <br/>\ntables in third grade will never be comfortable enough with math <br/>\nto get interested in sixth or seventh grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you end up in a local group of unschoolers and you want to <br/>\nfollow the curriculum we&#39;ve outlined in this book, you&#39;ll probably <br/>\nneed to switch groups.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the main place I found that deals with unschooling. I <br/>\nthought there was a reference in the intro too but can&#39;t find it now. <br/>\nThe two authors, Susan and Jesse, believe in early phonics and <br/>\nreading as well. (Susan is the daughter and Jesse is the <br/>\nmother).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read TWTM, I like the idea of offering a child wonderful <br/>\nideas and facts of other places and times, teaching them to <br/>\nreason and put their thoughts into competent writing and <br/>\nenabling them to interact with information from a rich variety of <br/>\nsources.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat got to us after using it as a &quot;plan&quot; is that the very goal I <br/>\nwanted to achieve (that the child would be excited by and <br/>\nstimulate in his/her education) became drudgery and the very <br/>\nthings I hoped would catch fire became onerous. By leaving the <br/>\nkids alone, and by providing lots of great books to read, and <br/>\nenjoying them together as they&#39;ve been inteested, we&#39;ve ended <br/>\nup learning about many of the very topics Susan imagines they <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t cover... left to themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, nuff said. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56629,"nextTopicId":56653}}
