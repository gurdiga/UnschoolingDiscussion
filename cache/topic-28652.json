We had to hold him down physically on occassion to prevent injury<br/>\nto him or others but the trick was to keep talking in a very quiet voice.<br/>\n Over time, we&#39;ve learned to recognize his symptoms sooner and we can<br/>\nstop the problems before they start often.  When we can&#39;t the rule of<br/>\nthumb is to stop the action - take him away from the situation if we can.<br/>\n Sometimes that means to another room or outside but then we sit him down<br/>\nand let him talk it out and calm down.  But he is an extreme case with<br/>\nunique circumstances.  But I think the answer is in consistency.  Always<br/>\nreact calmly but always react the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, the eating issue (I really wish S was here to answer this one) <br/>\n </span></blockquote>My two<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; year old is down to eating nothing until he gets junk.
