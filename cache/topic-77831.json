Sometimes. But as a newer unschooler (2 years) I still have to be careful about my motivation. Our relationships are still healing and unraveling from years of coercion and forceful suggestion. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a home that’s not recovering from coercion and force, strewing can be a wonderful thing that kids were used to from before they could remember.    With babies and toddlers, I  knew that they could enjoy “discovering” a toy more than having it handed to them.  With a toddler, even the act of handing them something they haven’t seen is an exchange expecting a positive response. Not so, though, just putting something where they see and can reach it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe dynamic with my kids was that way from the beginning, and when someone asked me how I got interesting things in front of my children, when I was describing unschooling as being about living an interesting life and kids “just learning” (in a conversation with curriculum-users who were very skeptical) I said “I strew their paths with interesting things.”<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people want to criticize me 20 years later, that’s pretty tacky. :-)  I was doing it well, I was asked how, and I answered directly and honestly and didn’t charge them money to hear it.   I also paid for a website to collect and share more ideas in public.  (Thanks to those who’ve helped me with that expense over the years.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strewing\">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-=-as a newer unschooler (2 years) I still have to be careful about my motivation-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDeschool.<br/>\nBe absolutely clear about your motivation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids have been away from coercion for two years, they should be over the schoolishness, and you should be getting there, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe careful about “have to” (have to be careful about my motivation).  If your motivation is to put something interesting on the kitchen counter because it’s interesting, there is no evil, in that, no taint, nothing negative.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don’t have to, but please don’t blame your kids if you can’t do it without expectation or the feeling that your’e being manipulative.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/haveto\">http://sandradodd.com/haveto</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe, perhaps, the things you’re imagining are schoolish.

Not to create a gossip session, but more to highlight that while it appears to be a simple concept, it&#39;s hard to do well and it doesn&#39;t appear to be a universally accepted practice even within the unschooling community. <br><div><br></div><div>I appreciate your response, Sarah. I still haven&#39;t really figured out the strewing piece, or it hasn&#39;t landed well the way I have tried it. My kids are *very* sensitive to what they perceive as suggestion or placement with a motive. Even when I don&#39;t have a motive, a gentle remind of something they had said interested them or something they wanted. Or an event that would go with an interest, an app, or software. One recent example is my son seems really interested in comedy and cartoons- more than just watching for pleasure we talk about plot and character and all kinds of stuff. Recently I was exploring an animation app as a potential tool for a class I&#39;m teaching, he came by while i was looking and said- i might like that. I told him he could go ahead and download it if he wanted- it was only 10 bucks. </div><div><br></div><div>He didn&#39;t and I dropped it. </div><div><br></div><div>So last night when i finally was exploring the animation app i settled on, I told him and asked if he wanted the login so he could play with it. No- it looked too basic, he said. </div><div>I&#39;ll take him at his word, it&#39;s not what he wants. But i know that if i say anything more about it, he may stop sharing with me. Knowing him, the best thing is to just let it be. Talk with him about his shows as he wants to talk about them. Any suggestion or offering on my end seems to land like a push. I still do it and do my best to check my own attachment- and make sure to suggest/offer with no expectation. My perception is that my offers/suggestions are declined more than accepted. </div><div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t tend to just bring in random things I think are interesting. Sometimes. But as a newer unschooler (2 years) I still have to be careful about my motivation. Our relationships are still healing and unraveling from years of coercion and forceful suggestion. This often makes me feel like I&#39;m doing &#39;nothing&#39;- and then I re-focus on being here, available, and making things sweet and nice. That they are always receptive to! And it builds the relationship, every time. </div></div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1780504454gmail_extra\"><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1780504454gmail_quote\">On Wed, Feb 8, 2017 at 10:49 AM, Sarah Thompson <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thompsonisland@...\">thompsonisland@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-1780504454gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span style=\"display:none;\"> </span>\n\n\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1780504454m_160956877681034730ygrp-mlmsg\">\n  <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1780504454m_160956877681034730ygrp-msg\">\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1780504454m_160956877681034730ygrp-text\">\n      \n      \n      <p></p><div>Strewing feels like a skill you can hone over time. It&#39;s taken me a couple of years to figure out how to anticipate what my kids want in a smooth way. For instance, we have lots of really nice art supplies. When I was a kid, my dad let me use an account at a fine arts store and I took full advantage:) So, I have all these lovely things but they are a bit special to me. However, my kids are artists and I want to share. At first I kept everything put away but let them know it was available. I noticed that they were always getting out the colored pencils. So after YEARS of putting the colored pencils away every day, I put them out in nice jars on the kitchen table-tidy but readily available. Suddenly, there are notebooks FULL of art, EVERYWHERE! It turns out my kids like to draw *while* they do other things, like watch shows. So then I added jars of markers, and I discovered that my 7yo *really* liked those. So now I&#39;ve bought a desk-elevator to put the laptop on so that my 10yo can keep his electronic drawing tablet out. And on it goes. </div><div><br></div><div>Same thing happened with videos. I would say, &quot;hey, let me know if you&#39;re interested, and,&quot; but that was too abstract. If I just emailed something and told Wallace to check his email, he would watch and then follow the path if he wanted. So it seems like there is no way to say, &quot;this is the philosophy of appealing to my kids interests.&quot; I try to anticipate AND be responsive, depending on the energy-if they&#39;re into something deeply they won&#39;t be receptive to something unrelated, but sometimes there&#39;s a window where I see a desire for something fresh, or something old that can be new again. </div><div><br></div><div>That last part is a lesson I am learning again and again, too. Sometimes the kids will get a gift that they asked for or that someone else is really excited to give them, but it goes ignored almost immediately. At first the giver would feel hurt ir rejected, or I would think, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll return it,&quot; but then, in a week or a month or a year, it gets discovered and enjoyed intensely. So strewing seems to me to be an extension of &quot;be interested and interesting,&quot; rather than a means of creating &quot;project-based learning.&quot; When I&#39;m with eclectic homeschoolers and they use that latter term, though, I take it in the spirit of &quot;interested and interesting,&quot; and I go that way.</div><div><br></div><div>Sarah</div>\n<p></p>\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n    \n    <div style=\"color:#fff;height:0;\"></div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote></div><br><br clear=\"all\"><div><br></div>-- <br><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1780504454gmail_signature\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><div><div dir=\"ltr\"><font color=\"#3d85c6\">Kelly Callahan CCH </font><div><font color=\"#3d85c6\">Concentric Healing Classical Homeopathy<br></font><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.concentrichealing.com/\"><font color=\"#3d85c6\">www.concentrichealing.com</font></a></div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:concentrichealing@...\"><font color=\"#3d85c6\">concentrichealing@...</font></a></span></div><div><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"><font color=\"#3d85c6\">(207) 691-6798</font></span></div><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ConcentricHealing\" style=\"font-size:12.8000001907349px;\">facebook</a><br></div><div><br><br></div><div><i><br></i></div></div></div></div></div></div>\n</span></blockquote></div>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":495438666,"authorName":"Sarah Thompson","from":"Sarah Thompson &lt;thompsonisland@...&gt;","profile":"wallacesmum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Strewing (was Project based homeschooling)","postDate":"1486570530","msgId":77857,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l4aWo5cmpxRzM2WE92NGotRk9BWllhbm5GOS1VcXdZN0I5YXprQTRVeGpHd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJERTkwQUJBLTI0QzctNDMwQS1COEVFLTEwNTgxQ0Y2Nzk1Q0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":77855,"nextInTopic":77858,"prevInTime":77856,"nextInTime":77858,"topicId":77831,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think there is a stuck place where I think I need to get rid of things because my house is small and I get swayed by the trend of decluttering.

For","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-662283302\"><div>Strewing feels like a skill you can hone over time. It&#39;s taken me a couple of years to figure out how to anticipate what my kids want in a smooth way. For instance, we have lots of really nice art supplies. When I was a kid, my dad let me use an account at a fine arts store and I took full advantage:) So, I have all these lovely things but they are a bit special to me. However, my kids are artists and I want to share. At first I kept everything put away but let them know it was available. I noticed that they were always getting out the colored pencils. So after YEARS of putting the colored pencils away every day, I put them out in nice jars on the kitchen table-tidy but readily available. Suddenly, there are notebooks FULL of art, EVERYWHERE! It turns out my kids like to draw *while* they do other things, like watch shows. So then I added jars of markers, and I discovered that my 7yo *really* liked those. So now I&#39;ve bought a desk-elevator to put the laptop on so that my 10yo can keep his electronic drawing tablet out. And on it goes. </div><div><br></div><div>Same thing happened with videos. I would say, &quot;hey, let me know if you&#39;re interested, and,&quot; but that was too abstract. If I just emailed something and told Wallace to check his email, he would watch and then follow the path if he wanted. So it seems like there is no way to say, &quot;this is the philosophy of appealing to my kids interests.&quot; I try to anticipate AND be responsive, depending on the energy-if they&#39;re into something deeply they won&#39;t be receptive to something unrelated, but sometimes there&#39;s a window where I see a desire for something fresh, or something old that can be new again. </div><div><br></div><div>That last part is a lesson I am learning again and again, too. Sometimes the kids will get a gift that they asked for or that someone else is really excited to give them, but it goes ignored almost immediately. At first the giver would feel hurt ir rejected, or I would think, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll return it,&quot; but then, in a week or a month or a year, it gets discovered and enjoyed intensely. So strewing seems to me to be an extension of &quot;be interested and interesting,&quot; rather than a means of creating &quot;project-based learning.&quot; When I&#39;m with eclectic homeschoolers and they use that latter term, though, I take it in the spirit of &quot;interested and interesting,&quot; and I go that way.</div><div><br></div><div>Sarah</div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Project based homeschooling by lori pickert","postDate":"1486568663","msgId":77848,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQxQjBGMDhDLTE4MDItNDJDNC04ODhGLUUwNzgxNDJBRERFNkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRENzQyQ0UxLThBOTYtNEIxMC1CRjBDLTNGNjlDNEJEQ0VDNUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":77847,"nextInTopic":77850,"prevInTime":77847,"nextInTime":77849,"topicId":77831,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*** I would agree with you if she weren’t using the term strewing (MY term) and then pooh-poohing it.

If a mother has been helpful, why would a child want to know that her “mentorin was visible”?  What would that even MEAN?  Being there is being there.  Answering quesetions, providing materials, a clean table—kids know whether moms are being helpful and supportive or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-You need to deliberately show that you are listening, recording, and thoughtfully responding…-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not a need parents have.  It may be a need that her method has, but parents who are looking at a child and his interests first will be doing all those things as a natural part of the relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo much noise, too little clarity.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":225155840,"authorName":"","from":"amberuby@...","profile":"amberuby13","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Project based homeschooling by lori pickert","postDate":"1486534247","msgId":77842,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG83ZWNoaSsxc21jcjEyQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG83ZWJwcSsxc281NDgzQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAxZWQwMWQyN2Y1NCRhNjNiYzEwMCRmMmIzNDMwMCRAaGFuZG9qaW4uY29tPiA8RTBGNEVBQzItNjgwRC00NzRELTkxOUEtOUUxOEFDOEE5NEQzQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8bzc4OXV2K29razkxZkBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDxvN2UxMWgrMTQ5MWo3MkBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+CTxEMDg2RjBBQS1GMzI0LTRCNEItODFERC04N0QzQ0UyQTdDQTZAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+CTxvN2VicHErMXNvNTQ4M0BZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":77841,"nextInTopic":77843,"prevInTime":77841,"nextInTime":77843,"topicId":77831,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"re: I would need to do some digging to see if I could figure out where it was first used.

You can read the thread here, if you’re a member of the group. Some of the original responses seem to now be missing, but it might still be helpful: https://www.facebook.com/groups/UnschoolingMom2Mom/permalink/1689579914599248</p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\"><br></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\">When I came across Lori Pickert’s book and website on Project Based Homeschooling, I was in a different stage completely. My daughter was around 1.5 - 2 years old, and I had not even heard about unschooling yet. At the time, Lori’s ideas were super inspiring. In wanting to be a better role model for my toddler, I started a business, began exercising more, even trained and participated in a half-marathon. I rearranged my daughter’s playroom, started to keep my things more organized, paid closer attention to things my daughter liked, began printing out photos of things we had done or seen, kept a post-it note pad holder in my purse and jotted down ideas or questions or quotes.</p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\"><br></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\">Back then, Lori’s ideas were fresher in my mind, and I wrote, “[Pickert] talks about setting up an environment for exploring, reflecting their interests back to them, certainly strewing, keeping a journal as a parent in which to document their ideas and work and questions and requests for materials ... She isn&#39;t saying strew with expectations or stop them from working on/exploring non-project related things. Rather, build in routines in which you&#39;re giving them your undivided attention.” All of those things sound great, and I think they parallel a lot of what unschoolers do, or can do, without messing up the parent/child relationship.</p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\"><br></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\">From the link I posted above, Pam Sorooshian responded:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote style=\"border:none;\"><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\">“I like her ideas about how children learn in general. I think what she offers is a great shift away from the more conventional ideas of how education works these days. I&#39;d encourage people to consider it as an alternative to other types of school-at-home if unschooling isn&#39;t an option for some reason.</p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\"><br></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\">I don&#39;t quite understand the urge many people have to adopt and use someone else&#39;s program wholly. Use what seems to fit your family well. Everything out there is just material for you to pick and choose from.</p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\"><br></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\">Lori&#39;s project ideas are pretty cool. Her parenting isn&#39;t entirely in line with my own. So I could get ideas from her projects and ignore the rest as being pretty much the same old conventional parenting stuff that I&#39;ve already thought through and rejected.”</p></blockquote><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\"><br></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\">So, even though her ideas worked for me as an adult exploring my own projects, I ended up letting my business fade away – for several reasons, really, but a big one was that I did not want to spend the time it would take to try and make it profitable. I wanted instead to be there for my daughter while she is still young (Sandra’s chart on this page helped with that decision: http://sandradodd.com/howto/precisely). I also stopped reading Lori’s ideas and focused on reading about unschooling instead. At the beginning, I think it was important for me to immerse myself in learning about unschooling, reading, trying, waiting and watching (http://sandradodd.com/readalittle).&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\"><br></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\">Nowadays, being more than 2 years into my own learning about unschooling, I feel I’m in a better position to go back to Lori’s book and figure out for myself whether or not the things she suggests are going to get in the way of unschooling and/or the relationship I have with my daughter. Certainly the things you mention – comparing my kid to other kids, getting caught up in whether or not she’s making anything that is Pinterest-worthy, worrying about whether she’s working on a project versus playing video games, freaking out if she doesn’t demonstrate or do something with what she’s learned – I don’t see that being helpful. However, thinking about your family culture and values, thinking about your home and how it’s organized, suggestions on what to include as part of an art studio, documenting and journaling – those are ideas that I have used or continue to use in our unschooling life.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\"><br></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\">So if you’re solid in your unschooling, then her book, website, and online forum can give you some cool ideas. And if you’re not solid, then I think they can be distracting and possibly push you further off course.</p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\"><br></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2115148519MsoNormal\">Have you checked out the group “My unschooler is interested in” on Facebook?

I have gone off rail a bit in last 12 mths and stopped reading about unschooling after a couple of years of reading lots. We are surrounded by schools where we live now (we moved from outback qld to the coast 12 mths ago and it&#39;s been a very stressful year) and where we go to church and where the girls dance are all schooled kids. We have met some home schoolers, no unschoolers. Slowly but surely I think my confidence has declined and do I pick up a book like the one this thread is about and I second guess myself because I have gone off track. I do need to refocus on the moment by moment learning because when I do I see it in abundance. Thankyou for helping me to bring back focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing is my eldest asked to start Distance ed (in Australia you can enrol your child on a School that offers Distance education where they get boxed curriculum and it&#39;s assessed by teacher. Legalities on Qld dictate it&#39;s either this or enrol with the Hone Ed Unit which also requires samples of learning in an annual report) . She asked at start of last year but didn&#39;t enrol her and she was still keen this year so I thought it&#39;s her choice for her own reasons so I enrolled her and she has her box of curriculum for this term. I have taken the approach of placing the choice with her to read the material and do the schook work or not but I won&#39;t force her to do it. My second daughter was enrolled for 2 weeks and she wants to go back to learning organically so I am withdrawing her. She found the work dry and boring and because she has always unschooled it made no sense to her how learning happens in this way nor could she see the point. My eldest wants to be a vet and she feels the needs to engage with the school process to enable her to go to university. And she also wants to feel like she is in line educationally speaking (as in school curriculum) with her friends who attend school in case she decides to go there. She senses if she went into a classroom now (at grade 7) she would not know what they were doing and feel behind. So doing this has messed with my head slightly and kind of pulled me into schooly thinking which I have spent the last few years removing from our life. I have felt confused. So I was recommended this book. That&#39;s some background.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my confidence has taken a hit and I need to go and deschool again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am hoping this distance ed experience will be short lived... that she will learn that it&#39;s nowhere near as fun as playing video games! But maybe she will enjoy it. So far she hasn&#39;t really wanted to do much because she prefers to watch things that interest her.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Project based homeschooling by lori pickert","postDate":"1486328229","msgId":77835,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUwRjRFQUMyLTY4MEQtNDc0RC05MTlBLTlFMThBQzhBOTREM0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxZWQwMWQyN2Y1NCRhNjNiYzEwMCRmMmIzNDMwMCRAaGFuZG9qaW4uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAxZWQwMWQyN2Y1NCRhNjNiYzEwMCRmMmIzNDMwMCRAaGFuZG9qaW4uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77834,"nextInTopic":77836,"prevInTime":77834,"nextInTime":77836,"topicId":77831,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Am I meant to make this happen more?

I hope that the person asking such a question will (as Jo suggested) dive back into deschooling, consciously, thoughfully, seriously.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it’s been three years and you’re still not confident, start again (yourself, start again—leave the kids alone to do what they’re doing) and re-examine what you believe about learning.  LOOK FOR, and find, the learning in all kinds of things that you currently don’t think about, haven’t looked at.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides my deschooling section, I have two recommendations for you.  Don’t just live in here, but maybe two or three times a day, for a while, find a page and read until you find something to think about or to try or to do.  Don’t talk about it to your kids, but maybe to your husband or other unschooling friends.  Examine and practice, and sneak in more and better interactions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com\">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>\nThere are about 1500 pages listed there, on my site.

But even after reading it a few time, I still find this book deeply flawed. To begin with, she took the content of an article and tried to make a book. It is thus poorly written, redundant, repetitive, and boring. More importantly, while I commend her for bringing focus to self-directed learning, her approach is problematic. By creating a &quot;work space&quot; and making &quot;representations&quot; of learning the focus, she feeds capital, not learning. By trying to create a culture of &quot;meaningful work,&quot; she devalues everything else. Learning and meaningful experiences happen at almost every moment. Learning isn&#39;t about &quot;representations,&#8221; it&#8217;s about being able to make new moves in life based on new knowledge. The evidence is in the living, not in the making. Products aren&#39;t real symbols of learning. Furthermore, by valuing &quot;work&quot; through projects and representations, this author devalues the place of thought and reading without purpose - of contemplation without product or direction. Reading for projects isn&#39;t more valuable than reading for fun. Project work is only more valuable if you devalue all other individual interests.</span><span style='font-family:\"Verdana\", sans-serif;color:black;'><br><br><span style='background:white;'>As Homeschool educators, I hope we see ourselves as facilitators of ALL interests and opportunities for learning. By drawing a distinction between &quot;work&quot; and &quot;play,&quot; she furthers a problematic conceptual framework that actually ignores real learning. In play, in flow, we fall into that magical place where we are connected, engaged, a part of something larger than ourselves, and in there, real learning, real connections are made. You can&#39;t force flow or play, it just happens. It happens while playing with dolls, Legos, or while playing with words.</span><br><br><span style='background:white;'>Sometimes we even need the random. This author counsels to not take random field trips, to try to facilitate connections by grouping experiences. As any experienced thinker knows, sometimes the random is where the &#8220;ah ha&#8221; moments are. You can&#8217;t predict or construct the connections. They just happen. They can&#39;t be forced, and sometimes something totally unrelated and random is what is needed to open up the necessary perspective to make a new connection.</span><br><br><span style='background:white;'>Learning happens. It happens every moment. It&#8217;s what you do with those experiences that matters, but it&#8217;s gravely mistaken to think you need to produce or act for there to be real learning. In fact, this demand for representations shows a lack of trust in the learning process itself. Learners don&#8217;t have to be trained animals that produce or show signs. Only a capitalist, factory model of schooling requires this. As home educators, we can free ourselves from such demands and allow children to explore and imagine without demands that create limits. Let them freely &#8220;write&#8221; plays while they imaginative play with other kids. Why sit them down and write it out? That constipates flow, destroys the imaginative, and puts real constraining limits on the possible.</span><br><br><span style='background:white;'>If you value self-directed learning, then free the learning. Let children be free to learn. Create a culture that values learning through freedom and choice, not through meaningful work.</span></span></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-443215941MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Verdana\", sans-serif;color:black;background:white;'> &nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-443215941MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Verdana\", sans-serif;color:black;background:white;'>Julie Varvaro</span></p></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":341538868,"authorName":"Kelly Callahan","from":"Kelly Callahan &lt;ridgelife@...&gt;","profile":"kellycallahancch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Project based homeschooling by lori pickert","postDate":"1486255658","msgId":77832,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZBNDhCN0Q0LUI5OUUtNDVBOC05OUExLUZGOEI2QzdCRjc2NkBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PG83NWpqaisxNzI3N2p1QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG83NWpqaisxNzI3N2p1QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77831,"nextInTopic":77833,"prevInTime":77831,"nextInTime":77833,"topicId":77831,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I love Lori Pickert s writing, and we started with project based homeschooling, using her stuff as a guide.
