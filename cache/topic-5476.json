The Texas Memorial<br/>\n&gt; Museum has millions of fossils in its collections. Spanning hundreds<br/>\n&gt; of millions of years, our fossils tell the story of the natural<br/>\n&gt; history of Texas. At any given time, however, only a fraction of TMM&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; fossils are on display in exhibits. The rest are in our research labs,<br/>\n&gt; on loan to other museums around the world, or stored in our collection<br/>\n&gt; areas.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This exhibit allows us to show off some of TMM&#39;s finest fossils. Some,<br/>\n&gt; like the saber-toothed cat and the exquisite starfish from South<br/>\n&gt; Austin, are old favorites that haven&#39;t been on display in<br/>\n&gt; years. Others, like Chasmosaurus and the plesiosaur, are newer<br/>\n&gt; acquisitions that have never been seen in public. In addition to our<br/>\n&gt; own specimens, we are fortunate enough to have a few rare pieces on<br/>\n&gt; loan for this exhibit. Two specimens are on loan from other museums:<br/>\n&gt; Confuciusornis from the Beijing Museum of Natural History, and<br/>\n&gt; Thrinaxodon from The University of California at Berkeley. In<br/>\n&gt; addition, Diplocaulus is on loan from a private collector. We are<br/>\n&gt; grateful to these lenders for allowing us the chance to display their<br/>\n&gt; specimens.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; link: Scratching the Surface Again!
