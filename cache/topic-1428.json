Andersen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andersen@...\">andersen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Raising Individuals in a Team Player Society<br/>\n&gt;By John O. Andersen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As a parent, I&#39;m concerned about our society&#39;s unqualified acceptance of<br/>\n&gt;the team player ethos.  Yes, I support the need for cooperation, and<br/>\n&gt;recognize  that team play can be a good thing.  However, if carried too far<br/>\n&gt;(as I believe our culture is doing), the team player mentality can damage<br/>\n&gt;individualism--the basis of a meaningful life.  So in raising our two<br/>\n&gt;children, my spouse and I are taking steps to protect them from the barrage<br/>\n&gt;of team player messages which seem to come from every direction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It would be easy to make the case that in spite of claims to the contrary,<br/>\n&gt;our culture is becoming increasingly homogeneous.  Too many people are<br/>\n&gt;following the same life script: get the dream house, take surf &#39;n&#39; sand or<br/>\n&gt;amusement park vacations, send the kiddies to college, learn &quot;new&quot; ideas<br/>\n&gt;from bestseller self-help books, or daytime talk shows, etc., etc.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;not that those things are bad.  Rather, it&#39;s the zombie-like way so many<br/>\n&gt;people are marching through life on intellectual autopilot apparently<br/>\n&gt;content that all of the important thinking has already been done for them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Human beings are capable of far more than just a life of jumping from one<br/>\n&gt;bandwagon to the next.  Achieving personal authenticity is critical in<br/>\n&gt;human development.  Choosing to follow a one-size-fits-all lifestyle does<br/>\n&gt;not lead to authenticity.  It leads to blandness and boredom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To help our two children grow up to be real people rather than carbon-copy<br/>\n&gt;team players, we try to demonstrate the joy of thinking and acting<br/>\n&gt;independently, and expose them to as much diversity as possible.  We hope<br/>\n&gt;this will help them develop eclectic tastes, and subsequently give them the<br/>\n&gt;strength to not spend their lives as unimaginative conformists.<br/>\n&gt;Specifically, here are some of the countercultural ideas we are teaching<br/>\n&gt;them:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Questioning of competition<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While competition can be fun, we as a family have found many other<br/>\n&gt;pastimes which are more satisfying.  Whether it be building play forts,<br/>\n&gt;finger-painting, sculpting, cartoon drawing, genealogical research, museum<br/>\n&gt;visits, family camping trips, or just writing, we all have hobbies which<br/>\n&gt;fully engage us and have little or no link to competition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Competition has a place in a market-driven economy, but we dispute that it<br/>\n&gt;has any constructive purpose in our personal and family life.  We believe<br/>\n&gt;our &quot;duty&quot; to compete is limited to the small carpet cleaning company which<br/>\n&gt;I own and operate.  I compete by offering a professional service at a<br/>\n&gt;reasonable price.  Beyond that,  we feel that competition is more often<br/>\n&gt;than not, a distraction from the more satisfying things we like to do.  So,<br/>\n&gt;we avoid it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Goal setting not necessary<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We teach our children to listen to their heart when choosing their<br/>\n&gt;interests.  The objective is to align their lives with the activities for<br/>\n&gt;which they have a passion and love.  This doesn&#39;t mean to run away from<br/>\n&gt;unpleasant or difficult tasks, but rather to shun those things which induce<br/>\n&gt;them to put on a phony face, or otherwise behave inauthentically.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Too often, people use goal setting as a way to rationalize greed or<br/>\n&gt;dishonesty.  For instance, a salesperson who wants to earn enough money in<br/>\n&gt;order to afford a dream home, may use that goal to distract his mind from<br/>\n&gt;the twinges of guilt he feels when he manipulates customer behavior through<br/>\n&gt;half-truths or flattery.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We hope to show our children that they don&#39;t need to compromise their<br/>\n&gt;ethics, or use goals as hallucinogenic drugs, to get them to do or say<br/>\n&gt;things which contradict their personal ethics.  Rather, we teach them that<br/>\n&gt;if they align their choices with their heart and passion, they will have<br/>\n&gt;very little need for goals.   Their passion for life will be all they need<br/>\n&gt;to drive them on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Living at high speed is living on the cheap<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We believe that always being &quot;on the go&quot; stifles individualism and<br/>\n&gt;creativity.  True, such a life can be exciting, but it takes a heavy toll<br/>\n&gt;on those quiet moments so necessary for thinking, and mental regrouping.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; During one 18 month period I lived in a 200+ year old cottage in a small<br/>\n&gt;village in rural Oxfordshire, England.  My favorite pastime back then was<br/>\n&gt;to spend evenings and weekends strolling through the village and across the<br/>\n&gt;surrounding farms to the neighboring villages.  There was an ancient Roman<br/>\n&gt;villa in the area which had an unusually well-preserved mosaic tile floor.<br/>\n&gt;There were old barns still functional after centuries of use.  There were<br/>\n&gt;small shops and picturesque village greens.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Leisurely country walks to such places filled many of my hours.  Those<br/>\n&gt;walks helped me to learn about rural England and gave me many hours to just<br/>\n&gt;think about life in general.  Had I spent my leisure time with fellow<br/>\n&gt;Americans on the base, attending meetings, sporting events, shopping for<br/>\n&gt;knickknacks, or just hanging out at the Base Exchange (the closest<br/>\n&gt;equivalent to the mall), I would have had fewer of those walks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; These days, we as a family carefully scrutinize our outside time<br/>\n&gt;commitments.  We&#39;ve already figured out what brings us the greatest joy:<br/>\n&gt;time together, time for creativity, time for unstructured play.  So we are<br/>\n&gt;vigilant against anything which may subtract from that most precious time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our hope is that we&#39;re instilling in our children a love of solitude, of<br/>\n&gt;space between activities, of preserving a not insignificant chunk of each<br/>\n&gt;day for relaxation.  Hopefully this love will stay with them as they grow<br/>\n&gt;up and be more important to them than being part of the crowd which is<br/>\n&gt;chronically busy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Money is just one of many types of wealth<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s no escaping the fact that we must concern ourselves with money.<br/>\n&gt;However, we hope to convey to our children that money is just one form of<br/>\n&gt;wealth and in many ways inferior to the other forms they might pursue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We see wealth opportunities all around us.   A person, for instance, could<br/>\n&gt;devote a lot energy to cultivating her brain to the point where it is<br/>\n&gt;overflowing with original ideas.  Others would recognize this and consider<br/>\n&gt;it a privilege just to talk with such a person.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is knowing the names of all of the plants in your region, recognizing<br/>\n&gt;subtle weather phenomena, or understanding animal behavior another type of<br/>\n&gt;wealth?  I like to think so.  Brain wealth is the sort which travels well,<br/>\n&gt;opens doors to interesting encounters, and promises a lifetime of richly<br/>\n&gt;satisfying and often unexpected learning pleasure.<br/>\n&gt;.<br/>\n&gt; Another type of wealth is a life filled with diverse experiences.  Some<br/>\n&gt;gifted and often misunderstood people seek such wealth in the context of<br/>\n&gt;their career path.  For instance, a man could start as an engineer, then<br/>\n&gt;become a painter, then a janitor, then a plumber--whatever strikes his<br/>\n&gt;fancy.  Though such people may have trouble in the conventional job market,<br/>\n&gt;they are among the most fascinating and multi-talented people around.<br/>\n&gt;Certainly they possess incalculable wealth.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Conclusion: Waging the battle against tyrannical team play<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s time we as a culture fought back against the team player ethos which<br/>\n&gt;is carrying out a mass slaughter of individualism.  It&#39;s time we reclaimed<br/>\n&gt;our lives and scripted them with the unique ideas which all of our brains<br/>\n&gt;and hearts are capable of producing.  The way to start this fight is to<br/>\n&gt;foster in children a love of individualism, the time to develop it, and the<br/>\n&gt;courage to make it more valuable to them than peer acceptance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In raising our two children, my spouse and I hope that we can show them by<br/>\n&gt;our example that it&#39;s possible to live as a happy and thriving individual<br/>\n&gt;even in a world seemingly dominated by team players.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any questions or comments should be directed to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andersen@...\">andersen@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Check it out!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"John O.

Andersen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs a parent, I&#39;m concerned about our society&#39;s unqualified acceptance of<br/>\nthe team player ethos.  Yes, I support the need for cooperation, and<br/>\nrecognize  that team play can be a good thing.  However, if carried too far<br/>\n(as I believe our culture is doing), the team player mentality can damage<br/>\nindividualism--the basis of a meaningful life.  So in raising our two<br/>\nchildren, my spouse and I are taking steps to protect them from the barrage<br/>\nof team player messages which seem to come from every direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt would be easy to make the case that in spite of claims to the contrary,<br/>\nour culture is becoming increasingly homogeneous.  Too many people are<br/>\nfollowing the same life script: get the dream house, take surf &#39;n&#39; sand or<br/>\namusement park vacations, send the kiddies to college, learn &quot;new&quot; ideas<br/>\nfrom bestseller self-help books, or daytime talk shows, etc., etc.  It&#39;s<br/>\nnot that those things are bad.  Rather, it&#39;s the zombie-like way so many<br/>\npeople are marching through life on intellectual autopilot apparently<br/>\ncontent that all of the important thinking has already been done for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHuman beings are capable of far more than just a life of jumping from one<br/>\nbandwagon to the next.  Achieving personal authenticity is critical in<br/>\nhuman development.  Choosing to follow a one-size-fits-all lifestyle does<br/>\nnot lead to authenticity.  It leads to blandness and boredom.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTo help our two children grow up to be real people rather than carbon-copy<br/>\nteam players, we try to demonstrate the joy of thinking and acting<br/>\nindependently, and expose them to as much diversity as possible.  We hope<br/>\nthis will help them develop eclectic tastes, and subsequently give them the<br/>\nstrength to not spend their lives as unimaginative conformists. <br/>\nSpecifically, here are some of the countercultural ideas we are teaching<br/>\nthem:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestioning of competition<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhile competition can be fun, we as a family have found many other<br/>\npastimes which are more satisfying.  Whether it be building play forts,<br/>\nfinger-painting, sculpting, cartoon drawing, genealogical research, museum<br/>\nvisits, family camping trips, or just writing, we all have hobbies which<br/>\nfully engage us and have little or no link to competition.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tCompetition has a place in a market-driven economy, but we dispute that it<br/>\nhas any constructive purpose in our personal and family life.  We believe<br/>\nour &quot;duty&quot; to compete is limited to the small carpet cleaning company which<br/>\nI own and operate.  I compete by offering a professional service at a<br/>\nreasonable price.  Beyond that,  we feel that competition is more often<br/>\nthan not, a distraction from the more satisfying things we like to do.  So,<br/>\nwe avoid it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\nGoal setting not necessary<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe teach our children to listen to their heart when choosing their<br/>\ninterests.  The objective is to align their lives with the activities for<br/>\nwhich they have a passion and love.  This doesn&#39;t mean to run away from<br/>\nunpleasant or difficult tasks, but rather to shun those things which induce<br/>\nthem to put on a phony face, or otherwise behave inauthentically.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tToo often, people use goal setting as a way to rationalize greed or<br/>\ndishonesty.  For instance, a salesperson who wants to earn enough money in<br/>\norder to afford a dream home, may use that goal to distract his mind from<br/>\nthe twinges of guilt he feels when he manipulates customer behavior through<br/>\nhalf-truths or flattery.   <br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe hope to show our children that they don&#39;t need to compromise their<br/>\nethics, or use goals as hallucinogenic drugs, to get them to do or say<br/>\nthings which contradict their personal ethics.  Rather, we teach them that<br/>\nif they align their choices with their heart and passion, they will have<br/>\nvery little need for goals.   Their passion for life will be all they need<br/>\nto drive them on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving at high speed is living on the cheap<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe believe that always being &quot;on the go&quot; stifles individualism and<br/>\ncreativity.  True, such a life can be exciting, but it takes a heavy toll<br/>\non those quiet moments so necessary for thinking, and mental regrouping.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tDuring one 18 month period I lived in a 200+ year old cottage in a small<br/>\nvillage in rural Oxfordshire, England.  My favorite pastime back then was<br/>\nto spend evenings and weekends strolling through the village and across the<br/>\nsurrounding farms to the neighboring villages.  There was an ancient Roman<br/>\nvilla in the area which had an unusually well-preserved mosaic tile floor. <br/>\nThere were old barns still functional after centuries of use.  There were<br/>\nsmall shops and picturesque village greens.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tLeisurely country walks to such places filled many of my hours.  Those<br/>\nwalks helped me to learn about rural England and gave me many hours to just<br/>\nthink about life in general.  Had I spent my leisure time with fellow<br/>\nAmericans on the base, attending meetings, sporting events, shopping for<br/>\nknickknacks, or just hanging out at the Base Exchange (the closest<br/>\nequivalent to the mall), I would have had fewer of those walks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThese days, we as a family carefully scrutinize our outside time<br/>\ncommitments.  We&#39;ve already figured out what brings us the greatest joy:<br/>\ntime together, time for creativity, time for unstructured play.  So we are<br/>\nvigilant against anything which may subtract from that most precious time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOur hope is that we&#39;re instilling in our children a love of solitude, of<br/>\nspace between activities, of preserving a not insignificant chunk of each<br/>\nday for relaxation.  Hopefully this love will stay with them as they grow<br/>\nup and be more important to them than being part of the crowd which is<br/>\nchronically busy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMoney is just one of many types of wealth<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThere&#39;s no escaping the fact that we must concern ourselves with money. <br/>\nHowever, we hope to convey to our children that money is just one form of<br/>\nwealth and in many ways inferior to the other forms they might pursue.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe see wealth opportunities all around us.   A person, for instance, could<br/>\ndevote a lot energy to cultivating her brain to the point where it is<br/>\noverflowing with original ideas.  Others would recognize this and consider<br/>\nit a privilege just to talk with such a person.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tIs knowing the names of all of the plants in your region, recognizing<br/>\nsubtle weather phenomena, or understanding animal behavior another type of<br/>\nwealth?  I like to think so.  Brain wealth is the sort which travels well,<br/>\nopens doors to interesting encounters, and promises a lifetime of richly<br/>\nsatisfying and often unexpected learning pleasure.<br/>\n. \t<br/>\n\tAnother type of wealth is a life filled with diverse experiences.  Some<br/>\ngifted and often misunderstood people seek such wealth in the context of<br/>\ntheir career path.  For instance, a man could start as an engineer, then<br/>\nbecome a painter, then a janitor, then a plumber--whatever strikes his<br/>\nfancy.  Though such people may have trouble in the conventional job market,<br/>\nthey are among the most fascinating and multi-talented people around. <br/>\nCertainly they possess incalculable wealth.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConclusion: Waging the battle against tyrannical team play<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt&#39;s time we as a culture fought back against the team player ethos which<br/>\nis carrying out a mass slaughter of individualism.  It&#39;s time we reclaimed<br/>\nour lives and scripted them with the unique ideas which all of our brains<br/>\nand hearts are capable of producing.  The way to start this fight is to<br/>\nfoster in children a love of individualism, the time to develop it, and the<br/>\ncourage to make it more valuable to them than peer acceptance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn raising our two children, my spouse and I hope that we can show them by<br/>\nour example that it&#39;s possible to live as a happy and thriving individual<br/>\neven in a world seemingly dominated by team players.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny questions or comments should be directed to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andersen@...\">andersen@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1402,"nextTopicId":1446}}
