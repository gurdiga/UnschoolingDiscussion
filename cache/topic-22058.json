Actually in oder to indulge<br/>\noneself, with children all around all the time, you<br/>\nHAVE to involve them.  With stories of where the<br/>\nlittle bits of fabric came from, or letting them make<br/>\nthings too (bags, doll things, puppets, kite tails,<br/>\npockets, presents, decorations, pot holders, the<br/>\npossibilities are endless, costumes, things related to<br/>\nethnic origins) The possibilities are endless. <br/>\n<br/>\nSharon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

How long have you been quilting? As you&#39;ll read in my long post on quilting, I&#39;ve only been doing it since December, but love it and don&#39;t want to quit to eat or do much else....even sleep. Late at night after everyone&#39;s gone to bed is the best time---nice and quiet and no one comes to ask me any questions.....<br/>\n<br/>\nRead a poem the other day...made it into a sign over my new sewing table (which by the way, is actually a workplace desk--the office supply place had a going out of business sale yesterday and I got it &quot;cheep-cheep&quot;--they also thought I was strange when I said it wasn&#39;t for my computer or office, just to sew on.
