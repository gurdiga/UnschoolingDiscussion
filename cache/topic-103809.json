Educational <br/>\ngames on the computer are good, but do you also recognize that &quot;just <br/>\nfor fun&quot; games are equally good?  If she&#39;d rather play Mario Sunshine <br/>\nor Animal Crossing on the gamecube would that be just as okay as <br/>\nplaying a game that teaches presidents&#39; names?  Does she have a <br/>\nchoice? <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;She loves cooking and helping out in the kitchen, which I let her <br/>\nbut make her read the directions of the recipe and measure out <br/>\ningredients.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if she just wanted to play around in the kitchen?  What if she <br/>\nwanted to play around with ingredients and invent her own recipe?  <br/>\nWould that be okay too?  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Her father and her are currently taking a beekeeping class together <br/>\nat the local agriculture office once a week at night.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds good, as long as she had the choice to say, &quot;No, I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to take a beekeeping class, or any class at all for that <br/>\nmatter&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; I guess I&#39;m concerned because we have no set schedule.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds to me like she has just as much of a set schedule as you <br/>\ndo.

She&#39;ll learn <br/>\nwhat she needs to learn when she needs to learn it if you trust her <br/>\nenough to give her the freedom to make her own choices about what she <br/>\nlearns about and how she learns it.

They arent the &quot;point&quot; of the <br/>\nactivity, or the focus, but a wonderful, unavoidable by-product. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son helps out in the kitchen, or wants to cook, i encourage <br/>\nhim to do as much as he&#39;s comfortable with.
