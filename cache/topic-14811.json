It challenges our perceptions of the<br/>\nworld. I thought this quote would be apprecited by<br/>\nunschoolers:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve since come to understand the reason school lasts<br/>\nthirteen years.  It takes that long to sufficiently<br/>\nbreak a child&#39;s will.  It is not easy to disconnect<br/>\nchildren&#39;s wills, to disconnect them from their own<br/>\nexperiences of the world in preparition for the lives<br/>\nof painful employment they will have to endure.  Less<br/>\ntime wouldn&#39;t do it, and in fact, those who are<br/>\nespecially slow go to college.
