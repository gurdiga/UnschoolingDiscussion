Sorry, I guessed a wrong direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally have kids old enough to get away from one another on their own and <br/>\nalso old enough to want to hang around together on their own.   It&#39;s <br/>\nWONDERFUL.   I think if they&#39;d been schoolkids, a 19 year old wouldn&#39;t hang out with a <br/>\n13 year old, and maybe neither would hang out with the 16 year old, but in <br/>\nvarious combinations they do, and happily.   Or they don&#39;t, and contentedly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe principle we have here which came up again last week when Kirby did <br/>\nsomething to be funny and it made Holly scream her painful (to us) scream is &quot;It&#39;s <br/>\nonly playing if everyone&#39;s playing.&quot;     Kirby had taken a bite out of her <br/>\nfood after she said &quot;don&#39;t get my food.&quot;   He did it knowing he had a new one to <br/>\nreplace it with, and he did it to get a laugh out of visiting kids.   But <br/>\nHolly SCREAMED and was too upset to eat, and Kirby thought that was a stupid <br/>\nresponse, and I talked to both of them separately and neither could be immediately <br/>\nsoothed.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut from a bigger perspective, within an hour or less Kirby had apologized, <br/>\nand what we discussed will probably help them both do better in future <br/>\nsituations with each other or anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Judgment addition","postDate":"1124982425","msgId":107929,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjOC4yZjkyMTUyZC4zMDNmMzg5OUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":107895,"nextInTopic":107932,"prevInTime":107928,"nextInTime":107930,"topicId":107874,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-465239102\">&lt;&lt;In a group to which the child or parent might like (or  need) to return.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Add older ages and oh boy!-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout  considering older ages, the parent isn&#39;t making so great a decision. <br/>\n  <br/>\nIf every day and every moment is bridge-burning, well...   there  are six <br/>\nbillion people on the planet, and they could just move on each day  I <br/>\nsuppose.   <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Social&quot; itself requires &quot;acceptable&quot; to  exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&gt;&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I was reading this topic in the same thought.. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I wrote older ages I was thinking about the mix in ages in my own  home. <br/>\nBeyond that the mix of my 4 and going places that doesn&#39;t always fit all  <br/>\nages. I try to meet or go places where each of my children will have a friend or  <br/>\na item they like to play with. That&#39;s a challenge...<br/>\nI was thinking for instance (as i try to respond to this) my 16 mo is  trying <br/>\nto shut the tv off while my 3 yr old is putting his hand over the button  to <br/>\nstop the 16mo from turning the tv off. How I *tried to explain to the 3 yr  <br/>\nold (a very sensitive lil guy) that if he didn&#39;t panic (something we are working <br/>\n on bc he has a speech delay) about the tv being shut off that the 16mo would <br/>\n move on.

He did move on and will soon loose interest in  the tv going <br/>\non and off as the other kids did..  The tv was just moved to a  lower <br/>\nlocation for safety reasons so it&#39;s location and situation are better than  Cameron <br/>\nclimbing the coffee table to get to it.<br/>\n <br/>\n If I understand correctly it would be socially unacceptable for this  to <br/>\ntake place in someone else&#39;s home. I agree. That said my kids know that  someone <br/>\nelse home isn&#39;t theirs and it&#39;s just not an issue. They are more  interested <br/>\nin friends and new surroundings UNLESS it&#39;s my MIL&#39;s because it&#39;s all  <br/>\nbreakable and she freaks out so we just don&#39;t go as often while they are  lil. <br/>\n <br/>\nI think the topic has come up in the past about bigger families. The  <br/>\nchallenge with having several children is that the solutions are not always the  same <br/>\nor as easily solved. Our children all play together so sometimes it can be  a <br/>\nchallenge to keep the play fun for all.  <br/>\nThe 13 yr old goes faster on the bikes so the middle two sometimes get  <br/>\nfrustrated. They enjoy playing together and it&#39;s not always pretty but they  are <br/>\nlearning as they go. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe train table is in the tv room now and that has had it&#39;s challenges  with <br/>\nthe 16mo,3 and 5 yr old playing at the same time not to mention that the  dog <br/>\nalso wants a train...<br/>\nI have learned as each child came that what was natural in my  parenting <br/>\nrequired much more creativity everyday.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor the oldest he is generally gone playing with his friends during the  <br/>\nday,playing runescape, im&#39;ing,on the phone etc... We are both night owls so I  <br/>\nnurse Cameron to sleep in my bed(only way he will sleep) and when daddy comes  <br/>\ndown with Nicholas I go up stairs with the 13 yr old and play cards or just  <br/>\ntalk. Sometimes the 5 yr old plays also but mostly she likes her late night  <br/>\nmovies. Then back down and hopefully hubby is still awake for some adult  <br/>\nconversation that wasn&#39;t finished after dinner.<br/>\n <br/>\nSocially acceptable in a larger family with age gaps was my thinking.  Away <br/>\nfrom home just isn&#39;t a concern bc my kids enjoy other kids also. Other  <br/>\nchildren with many rules and no freedom, limits friendships but those are not  the <br/>\nfriends my children seek out.<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Judgment addition","postDate":"1124852200","msgId":107895,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM2Ljc4YmViZWI2LjMwM2QzYmU4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107894,"nextInTopic":107929,"prevInTime":107894,"nextInTime":107896,"topicId":107874,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He missed <br/>\nthree days of work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a long story but the first day he didn&#39;t quite get the message to his <br/>\nboss that he wasn&#39;t coming, and when he/boss called to see what happened to <br/>\nMarty, I had to say he was gone with a friend.    It&#39;s one of my personal <br/>\nwounds/guilts that if you&#39;re too sick to go to work you shouldn&#39;t &quot;earn the privilege&quot; <br/>\n(leftovers from early childhood) of doing anything fun that day.   So I was <br/>\nembarrassed and grumpy with Marty.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second day he was still only kind of sick, called in, and perked up <br/>\nlater.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third day he was unquestionably sick, called in, and his boss was sick <br/>\ntoo (but at least couldn&#39;t blame Marty for contagion).<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, it&#39;s a flexible-hours job.   Marty could go in anytime and stay as <br/>\nlong as he wanted to, but he&#39;s a schedule-loving kind of guy so goes noon to <br/>\nfive four days a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the point of the story is that on the second day Marty, knowing I had <br/>\nbeen so unhappy with him the day before, came and asked me if I thought he should <br/>\ngo.    Instead of giving im a yes or no answer, I went through all the <br/>\nconcerns I could think of that Marty should consider.     <br/>\nHe works alone lately, so coughing wasn&#39;t going to be a problem.   <br/>\nHe&#39;s a really fast worker usually, so one slow day wasn&#39;t going to hurt much.<br/>\nDid Mike have deadlines or was it a routine week?<br/>\nWas Marty in danger of hurting himself or making mistakes from being sick?<br/>\nWas Marty disliking the job and so feeling sick out of avoidance?   (No, he <br/>\nsaid he liked it, but the reason I brought it up is that not having years of <br/>\nschool experience, Marty might not have known, I figured, that some kids dislike <br/>\nschool to the point that it does make them physically ill when they wake up <br/>\nand realize it&#39;s time to go there.)<br/>\nI mentioned lightly (reminders) reliability and integrity, and being honest <br/>\nwith himself. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe called his boss and asked him about deadlines and pressing need, and there <br/>\nweren &#39;t any.   So based on that, Marty decided to stay home.   And I didn&#39;t <br/>\nmind, because he had given his boss a chance to persuade him to come, or to <br/>\nsay &quot;no problem.&quot;    <br/>\n<br/>\nI was judgmental partly because of memories of being prevented from going to <br/>\na girl scout or 4-H meeting the evening of a day I had missed school.   Those <br/>\nmemories are not as well dissected and cataloged as the school memories <br/>\nthemselves, and so I found a pocket of unresolved childhood   resentment and <br/>\nvery-minor trauma, and I knew it was personal and I told Marty it was.   <br/>\n<br/>\nKeith had advised me from work not to try to make him go or shame him, but to <br/>\nremind him he had a commitment and shouldn&#39;t make his decision too lightly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat complex situation, and the fact that Marty came and asked me to help him <br/>\ndecide whether to go, was the result of years of me helping him decide rather <br/>\nthan dictating what he must and couldn&#39;t do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I could somehow have said or felt that it made no difference one way or <br/>\nthe other whether Marty went to work, or that it made no difference how sick he <br/>\nwas or whether he had succeeded in getting the message to his boss, then my <br/>\nadvice wouldn&#39;t be worth a damn.
