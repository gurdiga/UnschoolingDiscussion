Problem with Zach is if you are wanting<br/>\nhim to do something, like get his stuff out for tomorrow, what he is doing<br/>\nright now is much more interesting.  If you are really into what is going on<br/>\nright now, he can&#39;t wait to see what is going to happen next.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is making strides though.  Last year, if I were to ask him if he<br/>\nremembered to brush his teeth because his breath smelled, he would flop on<br/>\nthe floor and whine.  He simply didn&#39;t want to brush his teeth and he didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant dragon breath either (or at least, he didn&#39;t want people to be bothered<br/>\nby his smelly breath).  This year, if I ask, he jumps up and goes to brush.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wants so much to be in control of his life that how the world works<br/>\n(sometimes A has to happen before B can happen) makes him nuts.  Luckily he<br/>\nis a very lovable nut  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1786","postDate":"1012502976","msgId":31827,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTMwMWMxYWE4OCQxMTViZmQ0MCRjY2E2YjFkOEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMTI1MDA1NjQuNjc0LjIyMDgxLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31829,"prevInTime":31826,"nextInTime":31828,"topicId":31827,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-733988755\">&lt;&lt;we have a law about infringing on other people&#39;s rights to have their<br/>\nfreedom&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are working on this.
