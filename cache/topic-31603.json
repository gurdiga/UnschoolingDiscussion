I though this list would help me do that.  I hope that it can.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Louise, What a big and wonderful step you are taking. Welcome to the <br/>\ngroup! How much have you read of the unschooling.com website? You&#39;ll find <br/>\na wealth of information that should be able to make you feel comfortable <br/>\nwith changing your mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have also found in talking to my dds that they need to change their mind<br/>\n&gt;set as well.  For example my oldest wants me to give her spelling tests.<br/>\n&gt;(Man do I hate spelling!!!)  Anyway, I figure that I will let her pick the<br/>\n&gt;words that she feels that she needs to learn, and give her tests from them.<br/>\n&gt;One of her teachers did this, and so she feels comfortable with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a John Holt book &#39;How Children Learn&#39; that actually gets down to <br/>\nthe nitty gritty parts of spelling test, math and other interesting ideas <br/>\nto get you started. I think you&#39;ll enjoy the part about kids giving <br/>\nthemselves spelling &quot;tests&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Anyway, I think that I will start with some structure.  Such as write in a<br/>\n&gt;journal.  Write some letters.  And have some books around that they can use<br/>\n&gt;with science experiments in them.  Also some math books and video games<br/>\n&gt;around.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Having stuff around is great! Although I&#39;m not sure if it falls into the <br/>\ncategory of &#39;structure&#39;. It means you got the right idea of providing an <br/>\nenvironment of options. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;How does this sound.  I know that the unschooling thing is to let the kids<br/>\n&gt;tell you what they want.  It seems to me from talking to them that they want<br/>\n&gt;some structure.  That will probably change, but to start with that is what<br/>\n&gt;they are asking for.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Someone on the list recently gave an awesome analagy about feeding a <br/>\nchild and unschooling. I sincerely apologize for not knowing the orignal <br/>\nauthor. I hope the author can let us know who they are:<br/>\n<br/>\n+   &quot;Unschooling&quot; is like feeding a baby-  when the BABY needs, how <br/>\n+ much the BABY needs- <br/>\n+ <br/>\n+   &quot;Schooling&quot; is like feeding a baby- when the MOTHER wants to, <br/>\n+ how much the MOTHER wants<br/>\n+ <br/>\n+   The difference lies in the locus of control- with unschooling, <br/>\n+ we give back our children something our society and culture  <br/>\n+ steals-  the right to govern one&#39;s self.   The right to be one&#39;s <br/>\n+ self, to know one&#39;s self.   With unschooling, we tell our <br/>\n+ children we trust them, we believe them-  <br/>\n+ <br/>\n+   We believe THEY know when they are hungry and full (weather it <br/>\n+ is for food, knowledge, affection, or anything) <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and let us know how it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nkolleen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31562,"nextTopicId":31615}}
