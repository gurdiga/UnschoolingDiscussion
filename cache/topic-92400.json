The other moms I was <br/>\nwith were waiting for me to freak out.  Other than shaking a lot I <br/>\nwas fine.  I know this mom felt horrible.  She wasn&#39;t responsible <br/>\nfor Jamie, but since she was suppose to be watching Jack (and her <br/>\nown kids) you think she would have noticed.<br/>\nSo, she probably harangued herself ;-)<br/>\nJoanna - whose wearing a bathing suit next time we go to the pool.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.

Of coarse, a couple of months after the<br/>\n&gt; adoption, she got pregnant with their son.<br/>\n&gt; She never makes a distinction and said she rarely evens thinks about<br/>\n&gt; it.  Her dd knows she&#39;s adopted, but it&#39;s not in her intro.<br/>\n&gt; She laughed about the biracial part.  She said, &quot;didn&#39;t you know<br/>\n&gt; Sage is our biracial adopted daughter?&quot;  I looked at her perplexed.<br/>\n&gt; This child looks as white as it gets.  They had specifically asked<br/>\n&gt; for a biracial child when looking to adopt.   The  birth mother told<br/>\n&gt; them the father was black.  They were there for the birth and when<br/>\n&gt; she came out, they were a little confused but thought she would<br/>\n&gt; develope more features of her father as she got older.<br/>\n&gt; At her first ped. appointment she mentioned her biracialness to the<br/>\n&gt; dr.  She said he laughed, and told her he really doubted this child<br/>\n&gt; was biracial.  It doesn&#39;t make any real difference, but it was funny<br/>\n&gt; how the stories connected.<br/>\n&gt; Joanna<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

Just like a kid who has regular contact with, say, <br/>\ngay people, would be less likely to say &quot;mom, why are those two men <br/>\nholding hands??&quot; Or a kid who has lots of homeschooled friends might <br/>\nbe less likely to say &quot;whaddya mean you don&#39;t go to school?? How do <br/>\nyou LEARN??&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 9 yo niece was shocked when my son told her everyone in his <br/>\n(former)class was black, except for him. She asked &quot;EVEN the <br/>\nteacher?? But i mean, your teacher was white right?&quot; Nope. She didnt <br/>\nthink having a black teacher was bad or wrong, she just couldnt wrap <br/>\nher mind around it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has had tons of contact/interaction with people who have <br/>\nvarying degrees of disability, both mental and physical, due to my <br/>\nformer job.  Now that he is 7yo, he wouldnt dream of asking a <br/>\nquestion about a wheelchair, or &quot;why does that person talk funny&quot;, <br/>\nbecause he knows the answer. I&#39;ve always been really upfront and <br/>\nhonest about what mental retardation is, the different causes, what <br/>\ntraumatic brain injury is, what schizophrenia is. A child that had <br/>\nnever met or really got to know a person who is disabled would <br/>\nobviously have alot more questions/curiosity about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think most people would be happy to answer a child&#39;s honest <br/>\nquestion about *whatever* (adoption, disability, etc)...the problem i <br/>\nthink occurs when the other parent tries to &quot;shush&quot; the child, or <br/>\ndrags the child away, as if the thing the child is curious about is <br/>\nsomething shameful. My child had made a comment about something once, <br/>\ni think it might have been a hook or something, some kind of prothesis<br/>\n(sp??)that he&#39;d never seen IRL before, and i just matter of factly <br/>\nsaid in a normal tone of voice what it was for. <br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t adopted but its been a lifelong plan of mine...i really <br/>\nhope to adopt a boy between 5-10 sometime in the next couple of <br/>\nyears. Anyhow, i wonder if part of the comments parents make about <br/>\ntheir &quot;Korean&quot; child or &quot;biracial&quot; child isnt a misguided attempt to <br/>\n&quot;recognize their child&#39;s heritage&quot; and not just pretend the child is <br/>\nwhite like everyone else in the family. Years ago there used to be <br/>\nthis belief that &quot;color doesnt matter&quot; or that &quot;love is color blind&quot; <br/>\nand that there were no additional issues when a child of color is <br/>\nadded to a family of another race. Now the emphasis is on really <br/>\nrecognizing and celebrating that difference.Thats not saying its good <br/>\nto define a child by their ethnicity, or adoption status. And the <br/>\nhomestudy/adoption process is supposed to teach parents how to handle <br/>\nthese situations. But unfortunately there are probably some adoptive <br/>\nparents out there who pride themselves in taking in a &quot;poor <br/>\nbiracial child&quot; or &quot;poor third world orphan.&quot; I think there are <br/>\nappropriately places to identify adopted children, country of origin <br/>\netc (such as in adoption forums)but in most settings its probably <br/>\nirrelevant. Kind of like how if you are posting on a special needs <br/>\nforum you might say &quot;mom of 5 year old autistic son&quot; but wouldnt <br/>\nintroduce him to the bank teller by saying &quot;this is my autistic son.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":131271049,"authorName":"Susan Gallien","from":"&quot;Susan Gallien&quot; &lt;susan@...&gt;","profile":"susanmarguerite","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] children as humans   was Re: Maryland unschoolers heading to MHEA?","postDate":"1080966104","msgId":92432,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWIwMWM0MTkzMyQyZDllZTBmMCQ2OWU4YjI0MUBTVUU+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQwNDAyMjI0MjIxLjc0OTIucW1haWxAd2ViODA2MDMubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+IDw0MDZFMzMwQS4xMDAwOTA1QHZvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":92429,"nextInTopic":92433,"prevInTime":92431,"nextInTime":92433,"topicId":92400,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t think there s anything wrong with kids commenting on different skin colors, it s nothing to do with prejudice, just childhood curiosity... many years","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1394246915\">I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with kids commenting on different skin colors, it&#39;s nothing to do with prejudice, just childhood curiosity... many years ago I had a child ask me why my kids had different colored hair, my daughter had straight` hair  so blonde that it was almost white while her big brother had dark ringlets.

When he was younger (2-4) <br/>\nit was color, or size of people, mostly.  He would come up and ask <br/>\nthem questions or ask me questions.  He talks to anyone he can to <br/>\nfind out whatever &quot;why&quot; he has in his head.  He&#39;s 7 now.<br/>\nColor and size no longer intrigue him.  If he sees a handicapped <br/>\nperson or someone doing something he hasn&#39;t seen before, he asks <br/>\nlots of questions usually to the person, if they aren&#39;t available, <br/>\nI&#39;m his second source. <br/>\nWe have never had a negative experience with his curiosity.  <br/>\nI find kids to be refreshing.  When my son Sam died, adults were at <br/>\na loss for words, uncomfortable around us.  Kids said things to me <br/>\nthat adults would never say.<br/>\nOne little girls asked all kinds of questions about what we were <br/>\ngoing to do with his stuff and his room.  Another boy, who had <br/>\nplayed with Sam at a family camp we go to said he wanted to come to <br/>\nour house.  I said &quot;sure, next time you come to our town.&quot;  He <br/>\nsaid, &quot;I wish I could have come when Sam was there&quot;.  I said, &quot;me <br/>\ntoo&quot;.  Another mom, who was standing there, thought I was going to <br/>\nbe upset.  I wasn&#39;t at all. <br/>\nI find kids to be so honest that I feel more honest with my feeling <br/>\naround them.<br/>\nThe other day, we were  at an indoor pool with some other families. <br/>\nOne of the boys, as I was walking by him, said, &quot;So how&#39;s Sam doing?&quot;<br/>\nI looked at him with suprise, then when I saw the honest interest on <br/>\nhis face and remembered he had just been to his grave a few days <br/>\nbefore (I found a picture he had drawn for him there) I said, &quot; I<br/>\nthink he&#39;s doing pretty well.&quot;  His poor mother looked mortified.<br/>\nAnyway, my point is, kids are just honest.   They are curious.
