Good thing  <br/>\nall those things &quot;they say&quot; about teenagers are not true - they&#39;re  <br/>\nnot totally self-centered, they don&#39;t have &quot;attitude problems,&quot; they  <br/>\ncare about each other and about their parents and they are doing what  <br/>\nthey can to make this difficult time, not just bearable, but actually  <br/>\nsomething of an adventure. Not one of them has complained at all.  <br/>\nMost of their belongings are not going to be returned for 3 to 9  <br/>\nmonths - they&#39;re just glad we&#39;re all together. They are &quot;rising to  <br/>\nthe occasion&quot; with flying colors! Far from us being at each other&#39;s  <br/>\nthroats, like people seem to expect, it has brought us closer to each  <br/>\nother - reminded us to appreciate each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. A LOT of people have asked the kids if they &quot;had to miss any  <br/>\nschool.&quot; They act like THAT would be either the best or the worst  <br/>\npart of this whole situation. Sometimes they act like the kids must  <br/>\nbe happy to have an excuse to miss school and other times they act  <br/>\nlike it was be really awful to have to miss.  Roxana has musical  <br/>\ntheater and dance classes and Rosie had karate and a guitar class -  <br/>\nwe got them there. Roya is a full-time college student - she missed  <br/>\nher Monday morning class, but hasn&#39;t had to miss classes or work,  <br/>\nsince.  Cyrus has had to take quite a bit of time off work this week  <br/>\n- but won&#39;t have to miss much more, since I&#39;m around to handle stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. EVERY single thing will be taken out of our house, inventoried,  <br/>\npacked, taken to a cleaning facility, wiped off, put into an ozone  <br/>\nchamber, repacked, stored until we&#39;re back into our house, then  <br/>\nreturned and unpacked. We will have a list of every single movable  <br/>\nitem in our house. That&#39;s kind of fun and we&#39;re thinking we&#39;ll keep  <br/>\nthe list going after we move back in - so we&#39;ll know where everything  <br/>\nis!<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Each kid is &quot;remodeling&quot; their own room - new paint, new carpet,  <br/>\nnew curtains, some new furniture - and we&#39;re going to take advantage  <br/>\nof being out of our house to do additional remodeling, too. So we&#39;ve  <br/>\nalready had some good discussions about color schemes and the  <br/>\nambience they want to create in their own rooms and how we want the  <br/>\ncommon areas - living room, dining room, hallways, entryway, kitchen,  <br/>\nand bathrooms - to feel, what our constraints are, how different  <br/>\noptions would fit with our chosen lifestyle, etc. Very cool - really  <br/>\n&quot;educational.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there is more - but I just thought I&#39;d post a little about  <br/>\nwhat our unschooling life is currently like. I won&#39;t be around much -  <br/>\nwe&#39;re sharing a computer AND I pretty much have a new full-time job  <br/>\nof supervising what&#39;s going on at my house while, at the same time,  <br/>\nfiguring out all the things you have to figure out when you remodel -  <br/>\nbuying new appliances, choosing flooring, picking out paint, and so  <br/>\non. We don&#39;t really know, yet, how long we&#39;ll be out of our house,  <br/>\nbut we&#39;re guessing it&#39;ll be three months or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife goes on and it is good!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n        Graduate school education   High school education   Home school education     Middle school education   New york school education   School education in california <br/>\n    <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

Sometimes they act like the kids must  <br/>\nbe happy to have an excuse to miss school and other times they act  <br/>\nlike it was be really awful to have to miss.  Roxana has musical  <br/>\ntheater and dance classes and Rosie had karate and a guitar class -  <br/>\nwe got them there. Roya is a full-time college student - she missed  <br/>\nher Monday morning class, but hasn&#39;t had to miss classes or work,  <br/>\nsince.  Cyrus has had to take quite a bit of time off work this week  <br/>\n- but won&#39;t have to miss much more, since I&#39;m around to handle stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. EVERY single thing will be taken out of our house, inventoried,  <br/>\npacked, taken to a cleaning facility, wiped off, put into an ozone  <br/>\nchamber, repacked, stored until we&#39;re back into our house, then  <br/>\nreturned and unpacked. We will have a list of every single movable  <br/>\nitem in our house. That&#39;s kind of fun and we&#39;re thinking we&#39;ll keep  <br/>\nthe list going after we move back in - so we&#39;ll know where everything  <br/>\nis!<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Each kid is &quot;remodeling&quot; their own room - new paint, new carpet,  <br/>\nnew curtains, some new furniture - and we&#39;re going to take advantage  <br/>\nof being out of our house to do additional remodeling, too. So we&#39;ve  <br/>\nalready had some good discussions about color schemes and the  <br/>\nambience they want to create in their own rooms and how we want the  <br/>\ncommon areas - living room, dining room, hallways, entryway, kitchen,  <br/>\nand bathrooms - to feel, what our constraints are, how different  <br/>\noptions would fit with our chosen lifestyle, etc. Very cool - really  <br/>\n&quot;educational.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there is more - but I just thought I&#39;d post a little about  <br/>\nwhat our unschooling life is currently like. I won&#39;t be around much -  <br/>\nwe&#39;re sharing a computer AND I pretty much have a new full-time job  <br/>\nof supervising what&#39;s going on at my house while, at the same time,  <br/>\nfiguring out all the things you have to figure out when you remodel -  <br/>\nbuying new appliances, choosing flooring, picking out paint, and so  <br/>\non. We don&#39;t really know, yet, how long we&#39;ll be out of our house,  <br/>\nbut we&#39;re guessing it&#39;ll be three months or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife goes on and it is good!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGraduate<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Graduate+s\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Graduate+s</a><br/>\nchool+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+<br/>\nschool+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+califor<br/>\nnia&c=6&s=181&.sig=XeERtAmMH6xOclFlfF3kXw&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nHigh<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo</a><br/>\nl+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+scho<br/>\nol+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+california&<br/>\nc=6&s=181&.sig=89oOLkTPWnhxf__b2u72QA&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nHome<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo</a><br/>\nl+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+scho<br/>\nol+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+california&<br/>\nc=6&s=181&.sig=1aW-X2S2ZokW3qzZ8RgBsQ&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMiddle<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Middle+school+education&w1=Graduate+sch\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Middle+school+education&w1=Graduate+sch</a><br/>\nool+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+sc<br/>\nhool+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+californi<br/>\na&c=6&s=181&.sig=ekWG86FHE6rjFjd8jaZHOw&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nNew<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=New+york+school+education&w1=Graduate+s\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=New+york+school+education&w1=Graduate+s</a><br/>\nchool+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+<br/>\nschool+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+califor<br/>\nnia&c=6&s=181&.sig=aSJE8BjHS18knvLinwtebQ&gt;  york school education <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=School+education+in+california&w1=Gradu\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=School+education+in+california&w1=Gradu</a><br/>\nate+school+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Mi<br/>\nddle+school+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+ca<br/>\nlifornia&c=6&s=181&.sig=gkGybS6R2TNc7Ffa1FldiA&gt;  education in california <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!

We had a fire in our  <br/>\ngarage (started in the dryer motor). The garage is attached to the  <br/>\nhouse - we smelled smoke, opened the garage door (a big heavy metal- <br/>\nbacked fire door) and the garage was filled with flames, floor to  <br/>\nrafters. My husband BRILLIANTLY slammed the door shut and yelled,  <br/>\n&quot;Everybody get out NOW!&quot; He grabbed the phone and threw it to me and  <br/>\nI dialed 911. Roya grabbed the dog and shoved her out the front door  <br/>\nand then she grabbed the brand-new little baby hamster that I got for  <br/>\nmy birthday. We all stood on the front sidewalk, watching the smoke  <br/>\npouring from the entire house and flames above the garage. I thought  <br/>\nthe house was lost, but the fire department put it out pretty  <br/>\nquickly. Only the garage really burned - but the rest of the house  <br/>\nfilled with smoke.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - here is what my kids are getting to experience:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. VERY close quarters. We&#39;ve been in a hotel for a week - five of  <br/>\nus, a large dog, a tiny hamster, plus a couple of friends who have  <br/>\nspent a lot of time here. Good thing we LIKE each other. Good thing  <br/>\nall those things &quot;they say&quot; about teenagers are not true - they&#39;re  <br/>\nnot totally self-centered, they don&#39;t have &quot;attitude problems,&quot; they  <br/>\ncare about each other and about their parents and they are doing what  <br/>\nthey can to make this difficult time, not just bearable, but actually  <br/>\nsomething of an adventure. Not one of them has complained at all.  <br/>\nMost of their belongings are not going to be returned for 3 to 9  <br/>\nmonths - they&#39;re just glad we&#39;re all together. They are &quot;rising to  <br/>\nthe occasion&quot; with flying colors! Far from us being at each other&#39;s  <br/>\nthroats, like people seem to expect, it has brought us closer to each  <br/>\nother - reminded us to appreciate each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.
