No one<br/>\nshould be forced to pay for other people&#39;s children. If we help others, it<br/>\nshould be because we want to, not because our home will be confiscated if we<br/>\ndon&#39;t. This is America...do you have the right to take your neighbor&#39;s<br/>\nproperty? If not, what gives the govenment such a right. The government was<br/>\ncreated to protect our rights, not violate them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna writes, concerning vouchers:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I chose to take my children out of the system and i don&#39;t want<br/>\n&gt; anything else to do with it.  Asking for our fair share comes with a<br/>\n&gt; whole lot more than we are bargaining for.  there is no getting<br/>\n&gt; around that.<br/>\n&gt; Joanna<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ned answers: <br/>\nI totally agree. No one should be required to have anything to do with (or<br/>\nbe forced to pay for) anything they do not use or don&#39;t approve of. That<br/>\nwould be tyranny.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are only two methods of dealing with people: Voluntarily, or by force.<br/>\nPublic schools get their funding by force -- the schools use a third party<br/>\n(government) to collect their money for them by force.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe voucher movement is a partial measure in recovering an element of choice<br/>\nfor parents, but the idea still leaves the fund collecting to the state and<br/>\nits force, and that will be the next big issue -- making funding voluntary.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, if vouchers give just a few children the means of escaping from<br/>\nhorrible schools, then they get my support. Ultimately, the only fair<br/>\nsolution is for all school funding to be supported by the parents who choose<br/>\nthem, with a variety of private scholarship methods to help needy families.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the government schools are getting more and more oppressive and<br/>\ndespotic, there is a balancing movement, such as homeschooling and a growth<br/>\nof private schooling, and growing awareness of the needs of growing<br/>\nchildren. We are an integral part of that counter balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\ncrazy libertarian ranter</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40584,"nextTopicId":40616}}
