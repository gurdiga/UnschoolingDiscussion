As my journey into unschooling has changed <br/>\nour family, so has the *unchurching* of my spirituality enriched us.  So, I&#39;m <br/>\nasking my fellow UUUs (and the rest of yous too :)) to help me out in <br/>\nintroducing these folks to the world of joyful learning in the context of the UU <br/>\nprinciples ~ which I read today and will modify to say *family* instead of <br/>\n*fellowship* and show their logical application to family.  I have a great book about <br/>\nthe founding mothers of the UU movement in the Midwest (can&#39;t find it in all <br/>\nthe chaos at the moment &lt;bg&gt;), I&#39;m looking for some supportive stuff there (as <br/>\none of the first ministers in Sioux City, IA was, herself, homeschooled).  I <br/>\nthought some John Holt quotes would be good ~ and maybe permission to use some <br/>\nSandra Dodd ???  I&#39;ve got until mid-August to get my thoughts straight :)  <br/>\nThanks in advance!  <br/>\n diana,<br/>\nThe wackiest widow westriver...<br/>\nâ€œRelationships are a prerequisite for producing results beyond ourselves. <br/>\nThey expand our imaginations to infinite possibilities that cannot exist in a <br/>\nlife of isolation.&quot;    --Brian Koslow<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76905,"nextTopicId":76841}}
