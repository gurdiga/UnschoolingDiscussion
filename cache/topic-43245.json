Do you like your Teacher? Even had one woman<br/>\nget in my 9 yo dd&#39;s face and demand to know, when my dd said &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>\n&#39;go&#39; to school, I homeschool&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;Well, when do you start LEARNING?!- as if the process could only<br/>\nlegally &#39;start&#39; on a certain day of the year.-<br/>\nI may have been a bit rambunctious in my &#39;classroom in the basement-ammo<br/>\nin the closet&#39;- description of Christian Homeschoolers and it was never<br/>\nmy intent to offend.<br/>\n<br/>\nIronically, I have even had this discussion with my own husband of<br/>\nlate.. We had some homeschooling friends over for dinner and that couple<br/>\nand I were comparing notes on our mutual failed attempts to join local<br/>\nhomeschool co-ops and field trips due to the fact that, by and large,<br/>\nthose groups are made up of Right Wing Christian Homeschoolers who<br/>\nactively seek to exclude our children from their activities because<br/>\naccording to them we do not belong to &#39;a Bible Believing Church&#39;. My<br/>\nfriends are devout Catholics and Deacons in their Parish but that is not<br/>\nenough for some reason.<br/>\nMy husband considers himself a Christian and took offense to our<br/>\ngeneralizations regarding the term.<br/>\nNow, this guy is utterly brilliant on many levels but .. think absent<br/>\n-minded professor... to say he is not dynamic, not &#39;up&#39; on current<br/>\nevents, national trends... well, that would be putting it mildly. We<br/>\ngently gave him an overview of the last few decades of  &#39;Christian&#39;<br/>\nagenda in America.  We came to an agreement that, yes, it is a very sad<br/>\ncommentary when the term Christian has become associated with such<br/>\nhideous ( go to the plumbing supply store to buy implements with which<br/>\nto abuse your babies) behaviors.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy blurb about basement classrooms, etc. was all from personal<br/>\nexperience. We left what should have been a wonderful &#39;co-op&#39; experience<br/>\nfor my daughter- who was very excited about attending- when it was made<br/>\nclear to us that we did not &#39;belong&#39;. My daughter was looking forward to<br/>\nsome craft classes and sewing instruction that was being offered just a<br/>\nfew hours one day a week; it all fit into my &#39;unschool&#39;  way of doing<br/>\nthings. The co-op was billed as non-denominational, no &#39;commitment of<br/>\nfaith&#39; signatures were required. Yet, there were prayers before every<br/>\nsession, Halloween costumes forbidden, no parent would ever &#39;allow&#39;<br/>\ntheir child to come play at our house...it was there that I was given<br/>\nthe rundown of what ammo their closets contained. It was within that<br/>\ngroup that a 6 yo little girl girl related to me how she was &#39;whipped&#39;<br/>\non any day that she she did not &#39; finish writing all her sentences.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile generalizations can be detrimental they exist for a reason; there<br/>\nis an element of truth in even the most general generalizations. It is a<br/>\nnumbers game....&#39;Christian&#39; homeschoolers have purposefully created<br/>\ntheir image. &#39;Christian&#39; homeschoolers do *indeed* have an agenda. They<br/>\nare, in fact, mostly Republican Right Wing voters with money.  And<br/>\nlawyers. And testing.
