One of the pots had a<br/>\ncrack in it, while the other pot was perfect and always delivered a<br/>\nfull portion of water.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the long walk from the stream to the house, the cracked<br/>\npot arrived only half full. For an entire two years this went on daily,<br/>\nwith the bearer delivering only one and one-half pots full of water to<br/>\nhis house.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, the perfect pot was proud of its accomplishments, perfect<br/>\nfor which it was made. But the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own<br/>\nimperfection, and miserable that it was able to accomplish only half<br/>\nof what it had been made to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter two years of what it perceived to be a bitter failure, it spoke<br/>\nto the water bearer one day by the stream. &quot;I am ashamed of myself, and I<br/>\nwant to apologize to you. I have been able to deliver only half my<br/>\nload because of this crack in my side which allows water to leak out<br/>\nall the way back to your house. Because of my flaws, you have to do all of<br/>\nthis work, and you don&#39;t get full value from your efforts,&quot; the pot<br/>\nsaid.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bearer said to the pot, &quot;Did you notice that there were flowers<br/>\nonly on your side of the path, but not on the other pot&#39;s side? That&#39;s<br/>\nbecause I have known about your flaw, and I planted flower seeds on<br/>\nyour side of the path. Therefore, every day while we walk back, you&#39;ve<br/>\nwatered them. For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful<br/>\nflowers to decorate the table. Without you being just the way you are,<br/>\nthere would not be this beauty to grace the house.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMoral:<br/>\nEach of us has our own unique flaws.
