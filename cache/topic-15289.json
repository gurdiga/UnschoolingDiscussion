And it&#39;s me who is fiercely afraid of the fire we&#39;re playing<br/>\nwith.  I&#39;ve watched the homeschooling community be divided along religous<br/>\nlines now for over 12 years.  I really don&#39;t want the same thing happening<br/>\nat the federal level.  I realize that all might turn out well, and I<br/>\nsincerely hope so, but I would be remiss if I didn&#39;t at least voice my<br/>\nconcerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe words *under God* were added to our national pledge in the 1950&#39;s.  &#39;54<br/>\nI believe.  If you visit the unschooling message boards you can find a<br/>\nwonderful discussion about the pledge.  Just do a keyword search.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I also disagree whole heartedly about the seperation of church and<br/>\nstate.  Thomas Paine has some interesting writings on the topic, as does<br/>\nThomas Jefferson.  The men and women who we elect surely need to be<br/>\nupstanding and knowing they have a faith that sustains them is a wonderful<br/>\nthing.  But our government does not have one religious foundation it must<br/>\nadhere to. Our government is based on ****the people**** and we are<br/>\ncurrently a pluarity of 288 million people.  All of us need to be present<br/>\nand represented within our republic. To believe it is just for Jews and<br/>\nChristians to run this nation is to turn your back on the very document that<br/>\nbegins with &quot;We The People.&quot;  A document we honor when we let it live and<br/>\ngrow right along beside us.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisaKK<br/>\n<br/>\nps  Last Wed I watched a homeschooling mom tell her children, in front of<br/>\nme.... if someone asks if you are a Christian, lie and say yes.  I just<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to deal with anything else today.  Is this the kind of nation we<br/>\nwant?
