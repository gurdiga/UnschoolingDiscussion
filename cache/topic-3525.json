Unfortunately, as they approach college<br/>\nage, more than a few &quot;throw in the towel&quot; so to speak in their often<br/>\nwell-intentioned quest to &quot;get ahead&quot; and/or qualify for college admission<br/>\nand later the working world.  There is nothing wrong with going to college<br/>\nand subsequently getting a job.  There is, however, something wrong when<br/>\nthose pursuits turn learning into something for power rather than pleasure.<br/>\nI&#39;m convinced that sort of thing happens more often than most people would<br/>\ncare to admit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to believe that unschooled children can grow up and enjoy the same or<br/>\neven greater freedom as unschooled adults.  They can do this while accepting<br/>\nadult responsibilities, financially providing for themselves and their<br/>\nfamily, and being active contributors to their communities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many other people who agree with me on this point.  A few of them<br/>\nhave created a fascinating non-commercial website with over 100 pages which<br/>\nexplores many aspects of what they describe as &quot;creating livable<br/>\nalternatives to wage slavery.  It may give young unschoolers the inspiration<br/>\nto continue following their bliss even as adults.
