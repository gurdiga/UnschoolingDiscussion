The whole &quot;population&quot; of <br/>\nthe town (which is usually an unimproved county park full of cactus) was <br/>\n1,100 people.  Our camp was 21 people, six of them homeschoolers from 9 to <br/>\n17.   We had a dining room where we served medieval food by candlelight each <br/>\nnight.  Even breakfasts were in wooden or metal plates. Drinks were juice, <br/>\nwater, wine (cheated and had tea for the caffein addicts) out of ceramic or <br/>\nwood or blown glass.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is something charming about that, but there&#39;s something totally insane. <br/>\n It took two pickup truck loads, three vanloads and a sedan with a big trunk. <br/>\n (OH WAIT!  Kirby&#39;s girlfriend has another sedan and HER trunk was full.)  <br/>\nComing back, though, three sedan-loads (a friend who had gone back to get <br/>\nsomething she left offered to let us fill her car up too), my mini-van and <br/>\nonly pickup truck loads.  I&#39;ll be doing laundry and dishes for another couple <br/>\nof days.  We had five &quot;period pavilions&quot; in our camp, augmented by two cabin <br/>\ntents and a few nylon domes hidden further back.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI taught a class on braiding &quot;gold&quot; (represented by yarn in this instance) <br/>\ninto hair, and things to do with French braids and then adding stuff to <br/>\nextend the braids (kind of medieval hair extensions, which was done with <br/>\nmetallics and suchlike for formal occasions sometimes in the good old <br/>\nmedieval days).  I took a class on the Sutton Hoo burials, taught by someone <br/>\nwo was once my apprentice within the club and is now getting a master&#39;s <br/>\ndegree in archeology in York, in England.   I remember her being just a goofy <br/>\nyoung girl taking a French class and a history class at the University of New <br/>\nMexico but mostly partying.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone who&#39;s a protege of mine took his second squire, and I was there for <br/>\nthe ceremony.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are all totally exhausted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToday I took a friend to the dollar movie because she was in a car accident <br/>\nyesterday (not her fault) and most of her parts are bruised and they sent her <br/>\naway from work to rest (she was in finishing a memo and they said &quot;WHAT!?  Go <br/>\nhome, okay?&quot;) and I forgot it was Tuesday when Kirby&#39;s supposed to teach a <br/>\nkarate class at 4:00 and take a class at 5:00.    My husband figured it out, <br/>\ncame home early and took him, but late.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat has been my weekend so far. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh.  It&#39;s late Tuesday.  Weekend is over.  <br/>\nNot quite.  Must bring in more coolers and dirty laundry now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the kind words.
