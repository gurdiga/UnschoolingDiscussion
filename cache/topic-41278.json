Good suggestion.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few years ago I read a fictional &quot;what if?&quot; account of Augustine, Martin <br/>\nLuther, and C. S. Lewis, meeting in a bar in Newport Beach, CA. They sat, <br/>\ndrank, smoked, and discussed Christianity. It was wonderful, for what you got <br/>\nwas the essentials of the Christian faith without any of the cultural baggage <br/>\nthat tends to get laid on -- especially here in America. By the end of the <br/>\ndiscussion, Luther (or Augustine, I can&#39;t remember) is really bummed because <br/>\nLewis has turned him on to cigarettes -- something he won&#39;t be able to get <br/>\nwhen he goes back!<br/>\n<br/>\nLutheran pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer is another one to pay attention to. No <br/>\ndoubt you&#39;ve heard of him and probably read him. He was cast into prison <br/>\nafter being caught in a plot to murder Hitler. Hitler named him &quot;My personal <br/>\nprisoner.&quot; Bonhoeffer was a chain smoker.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy have I twice mentioned smoking? Because it is the perfect example of <br/>\nwhere American Christianity has gone wrong. American fundamentalist <br/>\nChristians have failed to grasp the meaning of life. It is one thing for <br/>\npuritan liberals (the heirs of the original New England Puritans) to make <br/>\nlife miserable for the country with their own sets of politically correct <br/>\nDo&#39;s and Don&#39;ts -- they can&#39;t help it, it&#39;s their patrimony. It is a whole <br/>\nother thing for people who follow Christ to do such a thing. Christ, who came <br/>\nto give abundant life -- life which includes eating, drinking, conversing, <br/>\nlaughing, dancing, playing, having sex for pleasure, and ... smoking.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41338,"nextTopicId":41290}}
