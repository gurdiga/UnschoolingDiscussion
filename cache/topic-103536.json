Recently my 16yo read a series of fantasy stories by L. Roberson.  He really enjoyed them and read them around the clock in 5 or 6 days.  Was he &quot;addicted&quot; : )  ?<br/>\nHe is very intense with most everything he does. We discussed, later, the &quot;let down&quot; feeling he had when it was &quot;over&quot;.  This has happened before with other series.  We discussed the word of anti-climatic. &lt;g&gt;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n      I told him I have experienced the same thing before, the wanting more feeling.  I always loved the series stories.  My first was probably the Black Stallion.  I remember finding the book, as an adult, that Farley&#39;s son wrote, and being excited that there was another one.  It wasn&#39;t the same though : (<br/>\nI remember wanting more Narnia stories as a child ( I was so sad when I found out that CS Louis was dead).<br/>\nFunny, I don&#39;t remember feeling that way with LOTR.  Maybe because he did a great job of &quot;wrapping it all up&quot;. <br/>\nI always wanted happy endings and I was really mad when the &quot;dog died&quot;.  To this day,  I will avoid stories that I know have sad endings.  <br/>\n<br/>\n     I also used to read romance novels a lot. I would get so engrossed that I read too long (for me).  I would have headaches and neglect little things. Those books always had happy endings.  With any book, I invest a lot of emotion.  We go where we are most drawn and comfortable.  I can&#39;t remember ever not reading.  I will read most anything you put in front of me, but I have I finally found balance with the thick books. I try to pace myself, and I use book tapes when I have time to kill in the car.<br/>\n<br/>\n     If I had of done other things with the intensity of the reading of animal stories as a child, or the romance stories as a teen/young adult, people would probably have considered it bad.  Books are on the &quot;approved&quot; list though.<br/>\nSomething to think about. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth in MD<br/>\nWho recently checked out some short happy stories for a &quot;quick fix&quot;.
