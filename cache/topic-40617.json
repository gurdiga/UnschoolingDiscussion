Let me correct one thing, though.<br/>\n The Separation of School and State Alliance (www.sepschool.org) does not<br/>\nadvocate eliminating public schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt advocates the elimination of FORCED FUNDING of schools by government. In<br/>\nother words, public schools, like all others, should continue to exist so<br/>\nlong as there are people who are willing to pay for them voluntarily. That<br/>\nwould mean, of course, that those schools are providing a service that lots<br/>\nof people actually want.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, there is in the ballpark of $400B annually spent on the public<br/>\nschools. If that amount was not forced to be paid by citizens to the one<br/>\npublic school system, it would remain in the hands of those citizens who<br/>\ncould spend it for any school they would choose for their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are dozens of private funding programs today that help families afford<br/>\nalternative schools for their kids. Many more such programs would exist if<br/>\nthe tax funding of schools ended. And with that, many new schools would open<br/>\nthat would satisfy the varied needs of our diverse population.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40602,"nextTopicId":40628}}
