Fuller, about <br/>\nSomebodies and Nobodies. <br/>\n<br/>\n       His argument is that most social ills (including child abuse) <br/>\nstem from &quot;rankism&quot; in which individuals abuse the power and <br/>\nauthority of their position, or rank. And that individual dignity for <br/>\nall, regardless of rank, is the answer. In other words, to stop abuse <br/>\nof all kinds, the answer is to stop abusing power and authority (not <br/>\na very good argument for increasing State power and authority, a la <br/>\nCSB, to my mind!&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n       Bsically, then, racism is abuse by those of a higher rank due <br/>\nto skin color; sexism is abuse by those of a higher rank due to their <br/>\nsex; youth bullying is abuse by those who derive higher rank from <br/>\ntheir parents&#39; rank, or their own physical or financial prowess, or <br/>\ntheir greater numbers (gangs), et cetera. <br/>\n<br/>\n       The worst school bullies imo are not in the schoolyards, but <br/>\nthe classrooms and boardrooms and bargaining rooms. I also think <br/>\nthere are corporate bullies, political bullies, and media bullies.<br/>\n <br/>\n       And parent bullies too. Children generally are &quot;of low rank&quot; <br/>\nto almost everyone else (whether they are are school or not.) In this <br/>\ncontext, there is no human environment, including the family, free <br/>\nfrom rank, so it&#39;s unlikely that anyplace can guarantee safety <br/>\nfrom &quot;rankism.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n    In this context, Fuller says the way to minimize abuse between <br/>\nparents and children is for all of us as individuals to foster a <br/>\nsociety based on the same respect for individual dignity and <br/>\nachievement that civil rights and feminism and religious freedom and <br/>\ntrue education are all about. (Again, this would be the OPPOSITE of <br/>\ngovernment and the public imposing authority over individuals as CBS <br/>\nseemed to call for.)<br/>\n<br/>\n            <br/>\nSomebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank <br/>\nby Fuller, Robert W. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aol.alibris.com/search/search.cfm?\">http://aol.alibris.com/search/search.cfm?</a><br/>\nchunk=25&mtype=&qwork=7625554&page=1&matches=10&qsort=r&browse=1&full=<br/>\n1 <br/>\n&quot;. . .Low rank -- signifying weakness, vulnerability, and the absence <br/>\nof power -- marks you for abuse in much the same way that race, <br/>\nreligion, gender and sexual orientation have long done. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe book introduces new language and concepts that illuminate the <br/>\nsubtle, often dysfunctional workings of power in our social <br/>\ninteractions. It presents rankism as the last hurdle on the long road <br/>\nfrom aristocracy to a true meritocracy, brings into focus a <br/>\ndignitarian revolution that is already taking shape and offers a <br/>\npreview of post-rankist society. . .&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(Doesn&#39;t this sound like the respectful approach to our own family <br/>\nmembers we as unschoolers are applying on so many issues?)

Sometimes<br/>\nfor a week at a time when a game is new. Friends come over and play<br/>\ntoo. They trade video games around with friends. They read the cheats<br/>\nonline or order books (I cannot even count how many kids I know who<br/>\nhave learned to read this way).<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay - I MYSELF have spend days playing video games or online.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the problem again? &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I saw a problem - if there was depression involved and it was being<br/>\nused as an escape, for example, I&#39;d think about that and not about the<br/>\nsymptoms.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, I&#39;d simply get us out of the house a bit by finding things<br/>\nto do that would interest my kid. We&#39;d go to a science museum or the<br/>\nbeach or the bookstore or library or go to the toy store and buy a new<br/>\ngame or the art supply or craft store or hobby shop and buy a model to<br/>\nwork on or I might find a workshop of some kind offered by the city<br/>\nrecreation department or a dance class or go to Home Depot on a<br/>\nSaturday when they do their free workshops or to Joanne&#39;s Fabrics for a<br/>\nfree knitting class or on and on...<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I&#39;d also wonder whether you might be overstating things - or<br/>\nworrying in advance about something hypothetical. Kids can put a lot of<br/>\ntime into video games and still have a lot of time left for other<br/>\nthings. If you&#39;re interested in the positives of video games - see<br/>\nSandra Dodd&#39;s pages that started based on a presentation at the HSC<br/>\nconference a couple of years ago:<br/>\n   &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/games/page\">http://sandradodd.com/games/page</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThings my kids have done online have been overwhelmingly positive. For<br/>\nexample, they play games on Neopets - these games are great - lots and<br/>\nlots of visual development spatial games, lots of<br/>\nword/vocabulary/spelling games, and especially lots of math concept<br/>\ngames. Neopets involves earning money and even calculating interest and<br/>\nso on. Its great. They also play MUDS and MUSHES - these are online<br/>\nrole-playing games and can be very very elaborate. Roxana has been<br/>\ninvolved with Pern Mush for years - this is &quot;serious play.&quot;  I cannot<br/>\nimagine anything being better for developing writing skills than online<br/>\nroleplaying games. She also writes fan fiction - and lots of other<br/>\nstuff - including poetry. She puts it up on various fan fiction and<br/>\npoetry sites where others read and critique it. She creates websites<br/>\nand participates in &quot;site wars&quot; where people score each other&#39;s sites<br/>\non content quality, organization and design elements.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids have spent many many hours playing SIMS. This is the source of<br/>\nall kinds of reflections on behavior and economics and life - for my<br/>\nkids it has branched out into interest in interior design and in<br/>\narchitecture as well as a lot of discussion about people&#39;s behaviors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey subscribe to interesting email lists - where they get a &quot;word a<br/>\nday&quot; for example - some kind of interesting vocabulary. Roxana studied<br/>\nNorwegian for about a year - receiving a short email lesson each day.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately Roxana&#39;s role-playing passions (online and in theater) have<br/>\nmeshed with a college course in costume design. She specializes,<br/>\nonline, in writing &quot;descs&quot; (descriptions of characters). She writes and<br/>\nsells her descs to other players - who give her role playing items in<br/>\nreturn. To improve her &quot;descs&quot; she started looking at costume design<br/>\nsites and museum sites to find paintings of people from different<br/>\nplaces and times. She has learned an AMAZING amount of history and<br/>\ngeography through this interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just one direction that the online playing has led. But it<br/>\ngives you the idea that if you support the kids interests and are<br/>\npatient - don&#39;t see their current interests as a waste of time, see<br/>\nthem as the launching pad for the future that will go in ways you<br/>\nprobably can&#39;t foresee - that if they have support and parents that<br/>\nwon&#39;t pooh-pooh their interests - they&#39;ll move on to bigger and better<br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a contest, for example, between a kid who&#39;d studied ancient history<br/>\nthrough text books versus my daughter, who learned it through costume,<br/>\nliterature, drama, etc., I&#39;d place my money on my daughter to know more<br/>\nand have a more complete picture. AND, what&#39;s more, she loves it -<br/>\nfinds it endlessly fascinating. She just told me the other day that she<br/>\nthinks she&#39;d like to major in history in college. She&#39;s just turned 16,<br/>\nby the way. She started out at the community college taking computer<br/>\nprogramming classes in order to be able to jazz up her websites. She<br/>\nbranched out to music and theater classes - took a &quot;History of Opera&quot;<br/>\ncourse (again - she loves putting the operas into the context of their<br/>\ntime and place - learned a LOT of history in that class that went far<br/>\nbeyond opera).<br/>\n<br/>\nYour child probably isn&#39;t interested in opera, so you&#39;re thinking mine<br/>\nis &quot;different&quot; and that this doesn&#39;t answer your questions - doesn&#39;t<br/>\nease your mind when you see your child on the computer for hour after<br/>\nhour. But I could write similar things about many other teenagers I<br/>\nknow - but their paths would all go off in vastly different directions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing is that unschooling is sort of &quot;messy&quot; in that there<br/>\nisn&#39;t a &quot;plan&quot; and kids can often go in one direction for a while and<br/>\nthen seem to come to a dead end and turn around and go off in another<br/>\ndirection. It isn&#39;t like a kid who studies certain high school subjects<br/>\n- a couple of years of science, four years of English, a year of<br/>\nAmerican History, and so on --- and then goes on to sort of do that<br/>\nsame thing in college - follow a predetermined path. Unschooled kids<br/>\noften &quot;meander&quot; in their lives. They proceed in fits and starts. They<br/>\ndetour. But - those side trips can turn into their main life&#39;s journey<br/>\nwhen you least expect it &lt;G&gt;. And they all add up to make the child<br/>\ninto the person they are becoming. Parents who want a conventional<br/>\nproduct - a child finishes high school, goes to college, gets a degree,<br/>\ngets a job,etc. - may or may not end up satisfied with what unschooling<br/>\nbrings about - since it is, by definition, quirky and unconventional.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"unschooling","postDate":"1066669119","msgId":83094,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE3Mzg0MkY2LTAzMUUtMTFEOC05QjczLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMmYwMWMzOTcxZSQ2MDdiMWQwMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":83093,"nextInTopic":83095,"prevInTime":83093,"nextInTime":83095,"topicId":82932,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Somebody on another list asked about what an unschooling day was like, especially with high school age kids.

It refers to a<br/>\nphilosophy of natural learning as well as the lifestyle that results<br/>\nfrom living according to the principles of that philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\n   The most basic principle of unschooling is that children are born with<br/>\nan intrinsic urge to explore -- for a moment or a lifetime -- what<br/>\nintrigues them, as they seek to join the adult world in a personally<br/>\nsatisfying way. Because of that urge, an unschooling child is free to<br/>\nchoose the what, when, where and how of his/her own learning from mud<br/>\npuddles to video games and SpongeBob Squarepants to Shakespeare! And an<br/>\nunschooling parent sees his/her role, not as a teacher, but as a<br/>\nfacilitator and companion in a child&#39;s exploration of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeenage unschoolers often have developed some serious passions and they<br/>\npursue them with great energy. They may be anything from website design<br/>\nto ballet to breeding dogs to political action to anything else you can<br/>\nimagine.  Others, however, don&#39;t have one overriding interest, but<br/>\nspend their time sampling all kinds of things - moving from one to<br/>\nanother.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do the parents do? Transportation, help finding resources,<br/>\ntransportation, listening, buying supplies, transportation, listening,<br/>\nmake some phone calls to help find resources, discuss, listen,<br/>\ntransport.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids pursue their interests and the learning comes about naturally<br/>\nas part of them living their lives. Everything is connected. Subjects<br/>\nare not learned as separate topics but in the context of what the kids<br/>\nchoose to do with their time. Its amazing - but it works, because<br/>\neverything really IS connected and, in a rich and stimulating learning<br/>\nenvironment kids&#39; natural urge to absorb information and skills is<br/>\nnever limited or pushed down and they keep that same eager voracious<br/>\ndesire to learn that all kids have before they go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd has collected people&#39;s descriptions of their &quot;unschooling<br/>\ndays&quot; on her website at &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/typical\">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] re: PART 2: CBS story: Homeschooling Nightmares","postDate":"1066662964","msgId":83093,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmYwMWMzOTcxZSQ2MDdiMWQwMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDE1Ny4yNjJjM2IyNi4yY2JlOGZmNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":82983,"nextInTopic":83094,"prevInTime":83092,"nextInTime":83094,"topicId":82932,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... cbs story Outside of homeschooling circles, I have not heard a single mention of the report.

If you sincerely wish to save children from abuse<br/>\n<br/>\nthen devote more air time to the serious issues of mental illness, <br/>\npoverty and substance abuse.  These are the strongest factors leading to<br/>\n<br/>\nchild abuse and neglect in this country.  Let&#39;s put our efforts into <br/>\nfixing what we know is broken.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI particularly like this paragraph because it presents an alternative<br/>\ncourse of action that takes the point away from homeschooling, rather<br/>\nthan only defending homeschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe people at CBS aren&#39;t listening to defenses of homeschooling.<br/>\nEvidently the CBS researchers had already received plenty of information<br/>\nabout homeschooling, including deciding not to interview on camera a<br/>\nspeaker from HSLDA. As little as I like much of their policies, it would<br/>\nseem that they are a group that is known by the public. Having an<br/>\nopposing view (in the news item) presented by one of them would have<br/>\ngiven it much more authority, which is clearly why they were not<br/>\ninvited. As it is I don&#39;t know who Hal Young is, and he is presented as<br/>\na &quot;Homeschooling Advocate&quot; of no particular affiliation. It is easier<br/>\nfor members of the viewing public to dismiss him as some kind of<br/>\nindividualistic crackpot without the authority of any kind of<br/>\norganization behind him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that it is not going to matter outside of a courtroom, except<br/>\nto us, that these abusers were not &quot;technically&quot; or &quot;legally&quot;<br/>\nhomeschooling, or that some of the kids were below school age. These are<br/>\ndistinctions that we make to ourselves, that could sound to those<br/>\noutside of homeschooling like back-pedaling excuse-making. Pointing out<br/>\nthat these people will look for ways to stay outside the law and be as<br/>\ninvisible as possible might be a good strategy for fighting state<br/>\nregulations. However I&#39;m not sure that it is a good argument to enhance<br/>\nthe public perception of homeschoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m starting to think that best way to do that is to continue to be out<br/>\nin the community, a goal not always compatible with the climate of<br/>\ndisapproval and suspicion (eg daytime curfews) that this news item is<br/>\nlikely to promote. On the other hand, I feel like *my* neighbors, who<br/>\nknow Jayn and see her around and talk to her, are pretty unlikely to<br/>\nsuspect abuse in our family just because we are homeschooling. Being<br/>\npart of a group and regular activities is self-defense. I guess the only<br/>\nway we can really counter this kind of scare-mongering is to be visible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said that, I know that being visible is no guarantee that abuse<br/>\nis not happening. There was mention of visible bruising or marks being a<br/>\nreason for absenteeism from school, but a determined abuser can find<br/>\nways to do so without outward signs. The most disturbing part to me of<br/>\nthat news item was about the Spelling Bee competitor and her horrible<br/>\nfather. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if the timing of the items has anything to do with the pending<br/>\nFederal Bill about Non-Discrimination against Homeschoolers.

We live <br/>\nin a tiny, very PRO public school town, we&#39;re not from around here <br/>\noriginally, and we moved to WV from California!!  To top the whole thing off, we have <br/>\nadopted a boy we are now homeschooling, and just took him out of school this <br/>\nyear.  Plus, right when this story &quot;breaks&quot; Michael has a big black eye/bruise, a <br/>\nresult of being kneed while playing football with all the kids (well, not <br/>\nkneed....he grabbed a bigger kid around the knees and held on and got a knee in <br/>\nhis face as a result.  It was truly an accident!)....argh!!  Lets see...what <br/>\nelse can I do to throw up MORE red flags????...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what do we do now?  Stop allowing wrestling, football, bike jumps/ramps, <br/>\ntree climbing, horseplay?  With 5 boys in the house now that&#39;s like trying to <br/>\nhold the ocean back with a broom.  How sad we may have to think like this now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are NOT isolated, however.  We DO live out in the boonies, but 3 of the <br/>\nkids (foster) are in school still, we are involved in 4H, we go to town a lot <br/>\n(including Michael) and we are not religious zealots.  We probably look more <br/>\nlike hippy zealots or hillbilly zealots :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we&#39;ll see...it&#39;s kind of early to see if there will be a backlash at <br/>\nhomeschoolers because of this show.  I guess it depends on who watched it.  We <br/>\nare in the middle of Travis and Justin&#39;s adoption as I write this, so I&#39;m <br/>\nprobably the most worried it will affect that.  (Then again, we have caseworkers <br/>\nat our house at LEAST monthly for our foster care agency, and they are welcome <br/>\nto come over anytime, so if they didn&#39;t like something they saw it probably <br/>\nwould have been a long time ago.)<br/>\n<br/>\n.......sigh.......don&#39;t really need this crap right now.........<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3899762,"authorName":"coyote&#39;s corner","from":"&quot;coyote&#39;s corner&quot; &lt;jana@...&gt;","profile":"calourojm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] PART 2: CBS story: Homeschooling Nightmares","postDate":"1066217691","msgId":82944,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBiM2IwMWMzOTMxMCQ1OGRjMmM5MCQ3ZDE4MGU0NEBBb3Blbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDNGOENBOEU2LjMwNjAyMDdAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":82939,"nextInTopic":82946,"prevInTime":82943,"nextInTime":82945,"topicId":82932,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"excellent - now send it to the advertisers! janis ...
