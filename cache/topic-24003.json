If the kids are too loud too late, the second <br/>\nwarning has sometimes not been as sweet and friendly as the first.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I came in after I had asked kids to PLEASE just go to sleep, because <br/>\nthey weren&#39;t getting along so well and they were making too much noise, and <br/>\nthey weren&#39;t asleep.  I wasn&#39;t LOUD, but I was mostly enraged, and said if <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t want to listen to me they could stop coming over.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell they didn&#39;t want THAT, and they did, truly, feel bad that they had woken <br/>\nme up a third time, and they were good guys, just young (12ish).  At that <br/>\npoint I was grumpy enough that if they had said &quot;You yelled at me, I shall <br/>\nnever revisit your home, I&#39;d&#39;ve said &quot;fine.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are kids whose parents don&#39;t reciprocate (which is fine), and who are <br/>\nhere A Lot.

When we yell here, there is no<br/>\nrage (there may be concern, upset, exasperation, etc.<br/>\n- I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve *ever* been enraged at anyone, let<br/>\nalone my family) - and yes the children are loud too -<br/>\nas in &quot;But Mom...&quot; but loudly. The best analogy I&#39;ve<br/>\nheard/read to help you imagine was the one someone<br/>\ngave about the large Italian family. (Not that most<br/>\nItalian families are loud - but they are sometimes<br/>\nportrayed that way by the media. And we are not<br/>\nItalian we are American mixed breeds.)  We are loud<br/>\nwhenever there is any emotion involved (so we&#39;re loud<br/>\n*a lot*.) And if anyone thinks we&#39;re loud when we&#39;re<br/>\nupset, they should hear us as we tell stories (about<br/>\nour day, or that day trip we took last week, etc.) we<br/>\nare all ear splittingly loud- and laugh until tears<br/>\nroll down our cheeks (many things strike us as being<br/>\n*very* funny.) <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And of course I still know that my daughters, not<br/>\n&gt; raised to any tolerance in<br/>\n&gt; this way, are in no way prepared to deal with it and<br/>\n&gt; it would be grossly<br/>\n&gt; unfair to thrust them into that situation at their<br/>\n&gt; ages. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I absolutely agree! (Although they may surprise you,<br/>\nmy dd have friend from all types of families, they all<br/>\nlove being here, never had one not want to come<br/>\nback!)And by the way neighbors do hear us - but they<br/>\nlove us - really.  They think we&#39;re funny.  (We think<br/>\nwe&#39;re funny too.  Sometimes even in the heat of an<br/>\nargument someone will say something *so* ridiculous<br/>\nthat it will end the argument, because we&#39;ll all be<br/>\nlaughing so hard - including the person who had tried<br/>\nto make the statement in all seriousness a moment<br/>\nbefore.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAND, I would still<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tell them that in my opinion any man, woman or child<br/>\n&gt; who shouts at them in<br/>\n&gt; anger more than once or twice &quot;in extremis&quot; (and had<br/>\n&gt; better apologize<br/>\n&gt; prettily and sincerely afterward, too)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would never raise my voice to a child who was not<br/>\nmine - but I would around a child who was not mine (if<br/>\nthey were here.) My dd (really except Felicity, who is<br/>\nnot usually loud) are all *very* loud and I&#39;m sure<br/>\nprone to shout in an argument.  Anyone who can&#39;t<br/>\naccept this probably stays away from them in the first<br/>\nplace. They have *lots* of friends though - possibly<br/>\nbecause they are prepared to accept most people for<br/>\nwhat they are - completely without judgement. If it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t affect them, they don&#39;t care. You&#39;d be<br/>\nsurprised at how many people react well to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n is not<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; someone they need to spend<br/>\n&gt; time around, but I&#39;m comfortably sure they would<br/>\n&gt; feel that quite naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly. They should not spend time around people they<br/>\ndon&#39;t enjoy being around, and there is no need to be<br/>\njudgmental about it.  You don&#39;t like being around<br/>\nsomeone (for *whatever* the reason) don&#39;t be around<br/>\nthem. Simple.

But the thing that both of us would have to realize is that both of those things are in the real world and it is our job to teach our children on how to deal with people different from ourselves......whether that difference be color, religion, or values.  I would much rather teach my child to deal with narrow minded people so they can better understand why they do the things they do then to completely shelter them only to have them later in life come up against someone like that and not know how to handle it.  I also think that some people out there are decent wonderful people even though they may have some kind of &quot;flaw&quot; in our own opinion and that we would miss out on that persons good qualities if we are bit to harsh in our judgment of their whole character based on one or two character traits.  I would like to think that even you have a good trait or two that you could be of good influence on my children just as I do.  In closing I&#39;d have to say that if I had to choose between someone narrow minded and judgmental or someone who shouts.........I&#39;d big the yeller any day!<br/>\nRachel<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Pam Hartley <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, September 02, 2001 7:22 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: shouting some more &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  So let me be sure I&#39;m clear here -- the shouting parents here are perfectly<br/>\n  happy if their children shout right back at them if they, the parents, do<br/>\n  something the kids get angry about?
