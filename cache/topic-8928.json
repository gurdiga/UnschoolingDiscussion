I enjoy just hearing that<br/>\nyou are out there, living your lives in a similar way, so I can get ideas<br/>\nor just say &quot;that sounds neat&quot; or &quot;me too.&quot;  I forgot to get specific<br/>\nearlier, so here are some things I want to know your thoughts on: <br/>\nWhat&#39;s your approach to reading? My daughter is almost 6 and has been on<br/>\nthe verge of reading for awhile without really taking off yet. Do you just<br/>\nread to them until they figure it out? Do you talk about some of the sounds<br/>\nletters make or ignore phonics completely? Have regular reading practice<br/>\nwhere I listen to her and tell her the words or never ask her to read<br/>\nunless it&#39;s her idea? Cindy, it sounds like you have a very advanced<br/>\nreader, what are Ruth Beechick books and BOB books? I don&#39;t mean to sound<br/>\nlike I&#39;m rushing it, but there&#39;s so much she can explore on her own when<br/>\nshe can read.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have some thoughts on unschooling music or giving music<br/>\nlessons? My daughter has expressed interest in playing the piano and my<br/>\nsister, my mother, and I can all play and so there&#39;s plenty of free<br/>\nteachers, but I want her to love music too, so I&#39;m uncertain about lessons<br/>\n(I took lessons until about age 10, then hated having to practice). I&#39;ve<br/>\nread that playing an instrument is beneficial in both emotional and<br/>\nintellectual ways, but I also read that a lot of the best musicians are<br/>\nself-taught.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your input!<br/>\nBecky in AR</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8897,"nextTopicId":8929}}
