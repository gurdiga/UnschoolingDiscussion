When the admissions  counselor<br/>\nstarted ticking off what my dd needed to do as a homeschooler to  get<br/>\nin, I felt that familiar sick feeling of panic. What if she wants  to<br/>\ngo there but I&#39;ve prevented her by not having her follow a  curriculum<br/>\n(which they stated over and over again she had to do)?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo  what am I to do? And can that be discussed here? Those are the<br/>\nkinds of  thoughts that run through my head.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\n <br/>\nYou started that first parapgraph with &quot;the (singular) admissions  <br/>\ncounsellor&quot; and ended with &quot;they.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;They&quot; (the college&quot;) probably didn&#39;t state anything over and  over.  One <br/>\nperson did.<br/>\nIf in stead of saying &quot;homeschooled&quot; you had said &quot;Who can I talk to  about <br/>\nadmission for someone who was alternatively educated?  Who&#39;s the  special <br/>\nadmissions expert?&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nThey can&#39;t tell you she &quot;had to&quot; follow a curriculum.  The most  they can <br/>\n&quot;require&quot; is that she has studied (or been exposed to, they can&#39;t  require or <br/>\nprove &quot;learned&quot;) some areas so that she&#39;s not totally stumped  by their beginning <br/>\nlevel courses.  Some schools have no remedial  level.  Other places DO and <br/>\nthey have tutors.  Maybe she&#39;ll need  that and maybe she won&#39;t.<br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe she could take a couple of classes at a junior or community  college <br/>\nbefore applying there, and that could be part of the application, that  she did <br/>\nwell in this class or that.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106238,"nextTopicId":106246}}
