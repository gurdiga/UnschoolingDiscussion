We weren&#39;t going <br/>\nto &quot;lie&quot; to our kids, then we were leaning toward Waldorf homeschooling <br/>\nand then we thought that the fantasy was a great idea and enriching and <br/>\nall that, then we weren&#39;t doing Waldorf and weren&#39;t sure about Santa, <br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, we haven&#39;t told our kids that there is or isn&#39;t a Santa.... <br/>\nthey just picked it up from cousins and friends and decided that there <br/>\nis indeed a Santa Claus.  DS asked me last year who Santa Claus is and <br/>\nI said &quot;Me!!&quot;  He thought that was hilarious and doesn&#39;t believe me for <br/>\na second so that&#39;s the fun we&#39;re having with it and I&#39;m not planning to <br/>\nchange anything.  He&#39;s happy believing in the magic of the holiday and <br/>\nSanta and he thinks it&#39;s hilarious that I think *I&#39;m* Santa.  And I&#39;m <br/>\nhappy that he&#39;s happy!

Of course this comes after I already <br/>\nhad my daughter believing in Santa Claus. She loves fantasy and is always to <br/>\nblur the boundaries between reality and fantasy but she likes to know the <br/>\nboundaries first. I&#39;m feeling pretty guilty that I&#39;ve constructed this false <br/>\ncharacter for my daughter. It doesn&#39;t mesh with the honesty and trust that are part <br/>\nof unschooling for me. <br/>\nSo a question...I would like the Santa thing to end with Cahterine and not <br/>\nhave Harry believing it as well. Has anyone else dug themselves out of the Santa <br/>\nmess after their child already believed? <br/>\nI know this will confirm with my relatives that I&#39;m a hippie freak and with <br/>\nmy in-laws that I&#39;m out to spoil all the fun but I&#39;m finally getting to the <br/>\npoint where their opinions don&#39;t mean diddly where it runs counter to my <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n********************************<br/>\nWell, we love Santa, and Julian believed, at least a little, until he was 11. <br/>\nHe&#39;d certainly been exposed to questions, but he let go when he wanted to. I <br/>\nconsider that one of the greatest gifts we&#39;ve had with unschooling... no <br/>\npressure to let go before he wanted to.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s fantasy, and play, and magic.<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96826,"nextTopicId":12225}}
