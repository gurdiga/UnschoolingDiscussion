But those are other philosophies pasted<br/>\non top of unschooling. Those are, in fact, limiting the unschooling<br/>\nphilosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers can limit unschooling however they want. But asking the whole<br/>\nphilosophy for guidance in limiting the philosophy in ways that are counter<br/>\nto the philosophy is to water the philosophy down.<br/>\n<br/>\nUndoubtedly that&#39;s getting read as &quot;this is unschooling&quot; and &quot;that isn&#39;t<br/>\nunschooling&quot; and people are thinking &quot;Who are you to say who is an<br/>\nunschooler and who isn&#39;t and what unschoolers can and can&#39;t do?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m not saying that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m talking about the *philosophy*, the *ideal*, the *idea*, the *concept*<br/>\nof unschooling. The *thing* people look to to help them decide what course<br/>\nis right for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nA life philosophy might be &quot;love one another as we love ourselves&quot;. Against<br/>\nthat we will weigh the decisions we make in life. Those who adhere to the<br/>\nphilosophy strictly will try to find a way to &quot;love&quot; a child abuser (eg,<br/>\nlove the innocent child that was damaged to create the abuser without<br/>\ncondoning their current actions or something like that). Those who don&#39;t<br/>\nadhere strictly to the philosophy can still use it as a guiding principle<br/>\nand adapt it when they feel necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, if the philosophy is altered in order to allow something that&#39;s counter<br/>\nto it&#39;s central issue, then discussion of it is only useful to those who<br/>\nwater it down the same way and useless to those who want the strict version.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove everyone except those who are trying to hurt us is not the same<br/>\nphilosophy at all. It&#39;s fundamentally changed in profound ways. The<br/>\nphilosophy&#39;s founders *knew* it was hard to love your enemies. They didn&#39;t<br/>\ninclude &quot;except for enemies&quot; for a reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about a child having confidence to learn what they need to<br/>\nlearn from whatever interests them. It doesn&#39;t mean &quot;whatever interests<br/>\nthem, except for things mom doesn&#39;t like.&quot; Moms don&#39;t like lots of things.<br/>\nWhy couldn&#39;t it be Unschooling without going into cities? Or Unschooling<br/>\nwithout plastic? Or Unschooling without unnatural foods?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt *is* hard to unschool with TV or all terrain vehicles or pop culture if<br/>\nthose are counter to a parent&#39;s personal philosophy. But we shouldn&#39;t warp<br/>\nthe philosophy of unschooling so parents can feel comfortable practicing two<br/>\nphilosophies that conflict. Those conflicts are their responsibility to work<br/>\nout, not the responsibility of the two (or three or more) philosophies.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] New Unschooling Groups","postDate":"1056642696","msgId":75586,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFRkIxNjg4Ljk2NzIzODkyQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PEJCMjA3N0YyLjFCNENFJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":75582,"nextInTopic":75590,"prevInTime":75585,"nextInTime":75587,"topicId":75494,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**If you were unschooling except for math, would you be upset that we never discussed how unschoolers do traditional math?

They can confine it to<br/>\n&quot;academics&quot;. They can extend it into parenting. They can even unschool<br/>\n&quot;except for math&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in terms of advice and ideas, the list needs to stick to unschooling<br/>\nadvice and ideas. It&#39;s what the list is called after all! ;-) Traditional<br/>\nparenting isn&#39;t unschooling -- even if unschooling parents use it. Mindful<br/>\nparenting is extending the ideas of unschooling into family life so mindful<br/>\nparenting is an appropriate topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe need to stick to unschooling advice and ideas makes it *seem* like<br/>\npeople are saying to be an unschooler means you need to be an attachment<br/>\nparent. But that isn&#39;t it. What is &quot;it&quot; is that if you&#39;re asking for advice<br/>\non an unschooling list, you&#39;re going to get unschooling advice. Attachment<br/>\nparenting is unschooling philosophy extended to parenting. Traditional<br/>\nparenting is not unschooling philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference -- and this could cause one of those &quot;rank&quot; discussions again<br/>\nif someone doesn&#39;t try to understand my point -- is that the list sticks to<br/>\nunschooling advice not advice from unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Some <br/>\n&gt; parents are not comfortable with not restricting TV, video games,<br/>\n&gt; foods, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And if to them the benefits of not restricting don&#39;t seem to outweigh the<br/>\ndifficulty of adopting a new parenting philsophy then they shouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but they still have some traditional parenting ideals too.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I suspect our parenting *ideals* are much the same: decent human beings.

You *choose* to insist.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we discuss here are the alternatives so parents *don&#39;t* feel they have<br/>\nto insist, so they know they have alternatives. Then they can *choose* what<br/>\nsuits them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure we don&#39;t need to tell people that one of their options is making<br/>\ntheir kids do something. (And that wouldn&#39;t be unschooling philosophy<br/>\nanyway.) That message is pervasive in society!

We discuss here the philosophy of<br/>\nunschooling, why it works, how it looks in real families.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow it looks in each family is different, based on each families needs.

I think the majority of this group attack new comers<br/>\n&gt; and brow beat them into having the exact perceptions of unschoolers<br/>\n&gt; that you are so adamantly proclaiming you are NOT.   The veteran<br/>\n&gt; unschoolers here will fly in hard and fast on a mother who says, &quot;I<br/>\n&gt; limit my childrens TV viewing&quot;.  They make it SEEM like thier kids<br/>\n&gt; rule the roost and they cowtow to thier every whim.  It&#39;s all in the<br/>\n&gt; presentation, the approach, the finesse ( or lack thereof) of the<br/>\n&gt; communication.   It is automatically set up to be a conflict, laced<br/>\n&gt; with confusion and berating attitudes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow!  I think we must be reading parallel but very different lists.<br/>\nAttacking newcomers?  I was not attacked when I first started posting, and<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen dozens of other people join and start posting without being<br/>\nattacked.  Somebody just yesterday (I think) posted about limiting TV.  I<br/>\nsaw some &quot;uh ohs&quot; and a few &quot;you might want to think about that&quot; kinds of<br/>\nposts.  That&#39;s all.  Now if that person comes back and vigorously defends<br/>\nher TV position, I expect there will be some people vigorously disagreeing.<br/>\nAnybody who has read this list for a while would know not to take a position<br/>\nthat they can&#39;t back up.  It&#39;s the new people who don&#39;t bother to read for a<br/>\nwhile who will defend their position and get all upset when someone<br/>\ndisagrees.  And the last thing I would have thought about the more prolific<br/>\nposters here is that their kids rule the roost.  What I&#39;ve learned from<br/>\nthese people is how to respond to kids&#39; needs in a way that gets everyone&#39;s<br/>\nneeds met.  I only wish I had learned that much earlier in my parenting<br/>\ncareer.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joyce asked what we would like to see in other unschooling groups.

I have never been an authoritarian, <br/>\ncontrolling parent or person. But I definitely fell into the category <br/>\nof seeing myself as having the right ideas about how to live, eat, <br/>\nsleep and TV view and felt it was my responsiblity to make sure <br/>\nmy kids learned my views.<br/>\n<br/>\n To me, this list does not want to accept that <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; some folks DO unschool, they do trust thier children to learn, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>they <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; do not use curriculum, but they still have some traditional <br/>\n </span></blockquote>parenting <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ideals too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not using curriculum isn&#39;t the definition of unschooling (though I <br/>\nthought it was for years.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we&#39;d unschool, we&#39;d begin well (no curricula, lots of <br/>\ninterest led activities and days), but my position of superior <br/>\nexperience, intelligence and wisdom gleaned through the years <br/>\nwould slowly undermine my trust that they would indeed learn <br/>\nwhat they needed. This happened the most when they&#39;d look like <br/>\nthey weren&#39;t doing anything I valued. (lots of time on the <br/>\nskateboard, or lying around on the floor, or listening to music all <br/>\nday). So I&#39;d add math back in, and then a little reading and then <br/>\nsome writing. Pretty soon I was &quot;just adding those things they <br/>\nneed and can&#39;t see that they need&quot; and Poof! Unschooling was <br/>\ngone!<br/>\n<br/>\n  If I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; need to go run an errand and the kid wants to sit home and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>watch TV <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or play a game..

If I buy chocolate chips to make a special birthday cake, I <br/>\n&gt; have to &quot;not&quot; let someone eat it all before I make the cake.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see why. Couldn&#39;t you warn your children that you need to <br/>\nrun an errand and find out what time would work for all of you? <br/>\nYou&#39;re assuming that kids mean to undermine your goals. Can&#39;t <br/>\nyou mark a bag of choclate chips and remind them that the cake <br/>\nneeds them so to leave them be? My kids would respond to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my point. You&#39;re starting from a different idea of who <br/>\nchildren are and it will influence your unschooling at some point. <br/>\nWhat will you do if your kids just aren&#39;t interested in prparing for <br/>\ncollege and you see ahead and believe that it&#39;s vital to their <br/>\nfutures? Will you then set a limit and say &quot;You must take these <br/>\ncourses?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list showed me that for my unschooling life to take off, I had <br/>\nto start from a completely different set of assumptions. The <br/>\nquestions you&#39;re asking no longer sound to me like they come <br/>\nfrom the worldview of unschooling. I predict that while you are a <br/>\nkind and conscientious mother, and while you believe in interest <br/>\nled learning, the fact that you see yourself in the position of  <br/>\nhaving more meaningful experience and the power to make <br/>\ndecisions for your kids will translate into doubts and anxiety as <br/>\nyou watch them unschool, especially if unschooling for your kids <br/>\nmeans studying cartoons by watching cartoon network all day <br/>\nevery day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould that be okay with you? Or would you want to &quot;guide them&quot; <br/>\ninto some other activity that is more &quot;unschooling&quot; as you <br/>\nenvision it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was the crux of it for me.

THAT&#39;s what this list DOES promote. It&#39;s NOT about <br/>\nchidren gone wild. It&#39;s about respect for each other. Children can&#39;t BE respectful <br/>\nunless they are treated respectfully. That doesn&#39;t mean letting them run me <br/>\nover. That would be disrespectful of ME.

It&#39;s not like that. It&#39;s a <br/>\ncase of mutual respect and trust. The &quot;education&quot; part of unschooling runs into <br/>\nthe &quot;manners&quot; part of life.

Not in <br/>\nthe &quot;we unschool except for math, etc&quot; sense, but more of a <br/>\nseperation from strictly AP methods only being accepted <br/>\nas &quot;unschooling&quot;.     To me, this list does not want to accept that <br/>\nsome folks DO unschool, they do trust thier children to learn, they <br/>\ndo not use curriculum, but they still have some traditional parenting <br/>\nideals too.   All of the no chores, bedtimes, &quot;rules&quot;, stuff.    Some <br/>\nparents are not comfortable with not restricting TV, video games, <br/>\nfoods, etc.   Personally, I have very VERY few restrictions on what <br/>\nmy kids watch, eat and play.  But, I have a tolerance level.  If I <br/>\nneed to go run an errand and the kid wants to sit home and watch TV <br/>\nor play a game.. I have to insist they turn the TV off and get in the <br/>\ncar.   If I buy chocolate chips to make a special birthday cake, I <br/>\nhave to &quot;not&quot; let someone eat it all before I make the cake.   If my <br/>\nkids will not quiet down and my husband desperately needs to go to <br/>\nsleep, I &quot;make&quot; them go to bed.. ( turn off the light and quiet <br/>\ndown)   If they continue to fight over a video game, I turn it off <br/>\nand direct them to find something else to play.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  There is a HUGE difference in being an adult with years of <br/>\nknowlege, experience, and impulse control whom lovingly and carefully <br/>\nguides thier children toward making good decisions and some <br/>\nauthoritarian, abusive, controlling parent who lives by arbitrary <br/>\nrules and restrictions.   Some folks on this group want to make it <br/>\nseem like it is an &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them&quot; standpoint.    Either you unschool <br/>\nby AP, no rules, no bedtimes, no chores, no restrictions.. OR you are <br/>\nNOT an unschooler.   I do not believe that.  That to me is the same <br/>\ntype of  discrimination as &quot;Christians&quot; saying you are not a <br/>\nChristian because you ______________( don&#39;t go to my church, wear <br/>\npants, watch rated R movies, like to read Harry Potter, have gay <br/>\nfriends,  etc etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nFolks on this group openly admit they have an arbitrary set <br/>\nof &quot;guidelines&quot; that define unschooling and unless you adhere to them <br/>\n100%, you do not belong here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow about a group that is a little more acceptance of diversity and <br/>\nthe sheer fact that  all families are uniquely comprised of <br/>\nindividuals for whom XYZ does not always work.?  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow about an unschooling group that does not discriminate based on <br/>\nrank?<br/>\n<br/>\nI really enjoy just talking and reading about what is going on in <br/>\neach others unschooling lives.. What works for you.. what was fun.. <br/>\nwhat was learned ( incidentally, not intentionally)???  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe a kinder gentler unschooling list.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75544,"nextTopicId":75592}}
