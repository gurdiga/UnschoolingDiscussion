(Obvious smile at the other end) Mrs. Dunlap? This is George Walker. <br/>\nHow are you?<br/>\nFine, George. You?<br/>\nDoing Fine, Mrs. Dunlap. Keeping busy with school and the horses.   If <br/>\nKelly&#39;s not busy, may I speak with her, please?<br/>\nSure. Just a minute.<br/>\nThank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents LIKED hearing that George was calling. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron had a friend that *sounded* like this. But he wasn&#39;t honest or <br/>\nsincere. We (Ben and I ) called him Eddie Haskell. <br/>\nHello, Mrs. Lovejoy. Beautiful day, isn&#39;t it? Lovely dress you&#39;re <br/>\nwearing---and your HAIR!<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly to turn around when he thought we weren&#39;t listening and be an ass. <br/>\nNOTHING sincere about that boy!<br/>\n<br/>\nI still adore George---and I think of him almost every time I hear my boys on <br/>\nthe phone. The sincerity was what makes the difference. George&#39;s mom is like <br/>\nthat---incredibly honest and sincere---and KIND.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s real, it&#39;s wonderful.
