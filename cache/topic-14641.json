But I do want to say that I think there is a difference between a child expressing themselves and a child throwing a tantrum.  Children should not be allowed to abuse others in their home or elswhere simply in the name of &quot;free expression.&quot;  One of the lessons to be learned in order for them to socialize with others is to respect others.  I tell my children that their feelings are real and valid and that it is alright to express them, but that expression cannot cause pain and distress to the innocent.  If they need to scream and kick things, they need to be alone to get it out.  If they need comfort and help calming down, we are always there to assist in any way we can.  But the best thing we can do, and often when they request, is to leave them alone to work it out themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren are learning to be adults, eventually, and need to understand early that being abusive to other people or doing whatever they please to others, destroying their own home or other people&#39;s property is not acceptable.  We have laws against those things for adults.  While I certainly make a lot of leeway for children who are NOT the same as adults and are still learning to be socialized, at the same time I certainly want them to understand what is and is not acceptable behavior towards others.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be true that children need to yell and be physical to get things &quot;out of their system,&quot; but not screaming and being physical to others.  That&#39;s abuse, whether you are three feet tall or six feet tall.  I have had a lifetime of relationships with folks who have rage issues and are abusive, and I do not want my children to be on either end of that kind of relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"adarl52357@aol.com","from":"adarl52357@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ChRmW8b95fSbp9aIwoirnX7T3lCOs7crHtPPFbOJoP6-3ED_R5T21AAW4d32U8Pax0mYYcpzV1nD","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Holding","postDate":"977256233","msgId":14659,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMzLmMyZWY0ZTkuMjc3MTE5MjlAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14657,"nextInTopic":14686,"prevInTime":14658,"nextInTime":14660,"topicId":14641,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m glad to be reminded of Solter s work.

I <br/>\nbelieve that the phrase &quot;use your words&quot; is way overused in our <br/>\nsociety, especially with young children. I think as a society we are <br/>\nterribly out of touch with our deepest emotions, partially because we <br/>\nwere not allowed to fully experience and express them - especially <br/>\nwhen it comes to rage/sadness, etc. Instead we were told to &quot;talk <br/>\nabout&quot; how we were feeling, but talking about feelings can never make <br/>\nup for actually feeling and expressing fully.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been in various forms of therapy and the major work I have had <br/>\nto do there has been to get in touch with my feelings and learn to <br/>\nactually feel them and express them, as I have always been very good <br/>\nat &quot;talking about&quot; my feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I hope I haven&#39;t offended anyone.

I know almost nothing about &quot;holding therapy&quot; but I do know this:  I have a son with very special needs.  One of the issues for us at home is his rages.  I have told him that he is allowed to rage and have a fit if he needs to, but he needs to go to his own room where he will not disturb others or hurt anyone until he feels better.  My son will be 4 on 12/22.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep a baby monitor in this son&#39;s room so that I can keep an &quot;ear&quot; on him when he is doing his alone time or calm down time.  If he gets to a certain type of crying, then I know he needs assistance to calm down.  I go into his room on these occassions and, if other attempts fail I, as gently as possible, force him to sit on my lap facing me, with his head resting on my chest or shoulder, and hug him firmly and rock.  This always serves to calm him, although in the beginning he usually makes half hearted attempts to hit or kick me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talk to him soothingly and kiss him and pet him while we do this.  I give descriptive words for his feelings and encourage him to talk about them.  We also talk about what kind of behavior is acceptable and what is not (screaming and throwing things at people, kicking and hitting people, uncontrollable raging, are all on the unacceptable list.)  My son is hyperactive and easily overstimulated.  There is also some indication that he has Sensory Integration issues that make it difficult for him to handle certain situations and to get control of himself without assitance.  I know that one therapy for sensory integration involves pressure massages similar to our holding time, which releases endorphins which allow him to get under control.  We have discussed all this with our family therapist too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother word about alone time.  We send him to his room when he begins to get out of control whenever possible.
