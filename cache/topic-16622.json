We&#39;ve<br/>\nlooked at books, watched videos and used balls around the house to<br/>\nrepresent the sizes and them put them in a line in the house and had<br/>\nthem as far apart as they may be in space.  One of the videos we watched<br/>\nwas from Bill Nye the Science Guy on the Solar system and he did a<br/>\nversion of that.  He did it to scale with balls and Pluto was like a<br/>\nmile away from the others.  I&#39;ve also draw the solar system as my son<br/>\nhas.  We have the computer game, &quot;The Magic School Bus Explores the<br/>\nSolar System&quot; which is excellent.  There is also a video and book of the<br/>\nsame episode.   Have Fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16615,"nextTopicId":16614}}
