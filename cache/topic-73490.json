I may <br/>\nhave in anger once. I wish I was perfect  LOL Itell him he is  bright and <br/>\nsmart. Sometimes I think he feels like my telling him he is smart puts pressure on <br/>\nhim and that is not my intent. Geez, hormones at 15!  Sometimes the more I <br/>\ntry to encourage the more hegets frustrated. Actually, he and I are very close. <br/>\nHe loves to hang out with me. We go to the mall and bookstore and stuff. He <br/>\nsays he wants to take summer classes to make up what he got Fs in. We just found <br/>\nout this morning that all of the day classes are full. I have no idea what he <br/>\nwill decide. Maybe night time is better for him. I have told him he has so <br/>\nmany options. He  wants to go to college by the way, it is not just my dream for <br/>\nhim. I think in the past he just wasn&#39;t very interested in the way they do <br/>\nschool, and unfortunatley I was not ready to HS. I had not learned about it. <br/>\nThen we got thiscomputer and I met people here that HS and I gained the <br/>\nconfidence to try. Then I had to convine dh. I don&#39;t think I totally have yet but I got <br/>\nthe courage to as Nike says.....just do it!  oh back to my original thot  LOL <br/>\n(sorry I type as it comes out of my brain!) I think he is not so much <br/>\ndisinterested (which may be still part of it) but more just undecided and feels <br/>\nfrustrated? At ps you can&#39;t just try a class then change your mind in the middle <br/>\ncuz you don&#39;t like it or don&#39;t like the instructor. I wish he would give HS <br/>\nanother try. I am still learning and make mistakes just like he does. It has taken <br/>\nme a while to deschool too!
