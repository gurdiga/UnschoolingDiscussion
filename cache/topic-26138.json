When those <br/>\nare routine, start looking around for other routines that would work.  As <br/>\nan example, I used to put off cleaning the bathroom until I couldn&#39;t stand <br/>\nthe smell anymore (didn&#39;t teach the kid to pee sitting down when he was <br/>\nlittle - too late now).  Then I started doing a quick clean while the dog <br/>\neats his breakfast before we go outside.  The bathroom is always quite <br/>\ndecent now, even though some days things get in the way and I don&#39;t do <br/>\nit.  Look for little things like that, one at a time.
