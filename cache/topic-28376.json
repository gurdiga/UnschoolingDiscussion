I waded <br/>\nthrough quite a few and found one that had the most concise info, along <br/>\nwith backing up its statements with support. Great debate material!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://silcon.com/~ptave/maurer3.htm\">http://silcon.com/~ptave/maurer3.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the summary:<br/>\n<br/>\nCONCLUSIONS <br/>\n<br/>\n      There is no authority in the Bible for the corporal punishment of <br/>\nchildren with rod or otherwise, except in the Proverbs of Solomon. It is <br/>\nonly Solomon who recommends child-beating. Never the Lord. <br/>\n<br/>\n      Solomon&#39;s child-rearing methods worked very badly for his own son, <br/>\nPrince Rehoboam. Solomon has an undeserved reputation for wisdom. In <br/>\nreality, he left his country oppressed and impoverished. In his later <br/>\nyears, he turned to idol worship and practiced &quot;the abominations of <br/>\nChemosh and Moloch&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n      There is no support for he beating of youth outside of Solomon&#39;s <br/>\nProverbs. Solomon&#39;s views are controverted both by Jesus and the Apostle <br/>\nJohn. <br/>\n<br/>\n      Paul warned Fathers against the anger and resentment that might be <br/>\naroused in their children by corporal punishments. The way of love was <br/>\nbetter. <br/>\n<br/>\n      St. Paul deplored the punishment of youth by human fathers who <br/>\nchastised youth &quot;for their own pleasure&quot;. Only divine chastisements were <br/>\nrighteous. <br/>\n<br/>\n      Jesus and John saw children as being close to God and urged love <br/>\nrather than fear in education. <br/>\n<br/>\n      If a Christian henceforth grabs for a rod or a paddle because &quot;the <br/>\nBible says so&quot;, he is heeding the words of an idol-worshipping king, <br/>\nrather than the words of Christ. <br/>\n<br/>\n      REFERENCES <br/>\n      1.
