Nobody has so  much as burned a <br/>\ncross or a sack of dog shit at our house.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen the kids first got e-mail I set them up with their real names (as  <br/>\nmine&#39;s set up), partly because it has been really USEFUL that I&#39;ve used my real  <br/>\nname in lots of ways.  But the boys opted out after a while for fantasy  game na<br/>\nmes that are now outdated.  Holly had AstaHD for a while (her SCA  name and <br/>\nthen her initials, and still uses that for neopets) but uses  HollyLynnDodd now. <br/>\n She&#39;d&#39;ve used HollyDodd, but I guess it was  taken.  On Halo 2 she used the <br/>\ndefault randomized thing they assigned her  (as did Kirby, but I think Marty <br/>\ncreated one; can&#39;t remember what his is).<br/>\n <br/>\nI think the opposite of living in fear is living with such courage that  <br/>\nothers are afraid to mess with you. &lt;g&gt;  People just don&#39;t threaten  my kids.  <br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s personality.  Maybe it&#39;s confidence.  It&#39;s  not cluelessness, though.  <br/>\n Maybe it&#39;s confidence born of a life  lacking in lack. &lt;g&gt;  They are not <br/>\nneedy, and so strangers can&#39;t get  their attention with candy (literal or <br/>\nfigurative).<br/>\n <br/>\nHEY!  That&#39;s a good, good thing to add to our evidence about the  results of <br/>\nlimiting food.<br/>\n <br/>\nJust think what factors would need to be in play for a child to go with a  <br/>\nstrange man into a car because he offered her candy.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106172,"nextTopicId":106217}}
