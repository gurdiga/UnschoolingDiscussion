I like the fact that you<br/>\nare speaking from experience and have BTDT in regards to most of the<br/>\nscenarios presented here. I love this advice and your sense of humor:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; No, you don&#39;t correct spelling for your child, any more than we would<br/>\n&gt; correct yours. Writing is what&#39;s important. If you correct her spelling,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; risk spoiling it for her, and turning yourself into a &quot;teacher&quot;...heaven<br/>\n&gt; forbid. She&#39;ll learn spelling in other ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In general, your posts bring me peace of mind and a sense of well-being - a<br/>\nwonderful feeling!<br/>\nI especially like to share your POV with my dh - as another father.<br/>\nKeep posting and commenting - I look forward to reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes to you and yours,<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; On TEACHING MYSELF:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When we say, &quot;He&#39;s teaching,&quot; we imply that the person already knows<br/>\n&gt; something.

What fun !<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For Josie:<br/>\n&gt; Yours is a common problem. You are seeing the results of being in public<br/>\n&gt; school...it takes time to overcome the damage done. From your post, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; hard to tell how long you&#39;ve been with this list, but if you stick around,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure you will find reasons to continue to trust your kids to be<br/>\n&gt; learning. The key just might be to increase their freedom instead of<br/>\n&gt; thinking of ways to regiment them into familiar (but dumb) ways of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;learning&quot; such as doing schoolwork.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If one of them wants a curriculum, make him/her BEG for it.
