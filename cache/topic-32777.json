If you do, the <br/>\n&#39;unparenting&#39; part is a bit easier to deal with.

In any community there are <br/>\nguidelines. These guidelines/rules are there SOLELY for the purpose that <br/>\nothers in that community can also enjoy their freedoms.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not, it then has to become a dictatorship, in order to keep boundaries <br/>\nfrom getting overstepped.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a boundary issue. And you may need to look into your past to see <br/>\nwhy your community is able to overstep so easily into your boundarys. <br/>\nPlease take this as it comes.. or not. It is not meant to assume or <br/>\nanalyze the issues. I can only write from my POV.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Another problem is that they never want to go out. Occassionally I need to <br/>\n&gt;run errands or would like to participate in a local group (Families for <br/>\n&gt;Natural Living). I don&#39;t get to because they refuse to go out unless it is <br/>\n&gt;something they want to do. I don&#39;t want to bribe or threaten, so we end up <br/>\n&gt;staying home and I miss out on needed adult contact.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Somewhere between bribing and threatening, there just &#39;is&#39;. Again, a <br/>\nboundary issue.<br/>\nIf they are too young to legally stay alone and you give them their <br/>\nopportunities to pursue their activities, they need to show you that same <br/>\nrespect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose I say I&#39;m an unparent in this regard. We are a democratic <br/>\ncommunity and everyone does what they do best to keep it from turning <br/>\ninto a dictatorship. Some of us have more experience, but we all process <br/>\ninformation the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; his knee because of the toys left on the steps. Do <br/>\n&gt;they care? Hell, no. This morning I tripped over toys trying to get to the <br/>\n&gt;laundry closet. I&#39;m pregnant and my center of balance is changing, so it is <br/>\n&gt;more difficult to manuever the obstacle course. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\nUnacceptable in a community. There is no reason that one person&#39;s <br/>\npleasure should put the safety of the others at risk.<br/>\n<br/>\nThats how you present it, thats how you have to believe it in your self.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Their bedrooms are <br/>\n&gt;a half level up from our bedroom and the uppermost level in the townhouse, <br/>\n&gt;so I don&#39;t have to see it.

This is their area.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you take a step back and think hard about rearranging the way things <br/>\nare laid out so you don&#39;t see their mess? Maybe even using dividers in <br/>\nthe basement if necessary?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son&#39;s room stayed unwalkable for almost a year. Finally he asked for <br/>\nhelp cleaning it up and then was so happy that he had access to toys he <br/>\ntotally forgot about. After that, he asked that if he set a rule, if I <br/>\nwould help him follow it by reminding him. He said he is young and <br/>\nsometimes gets excited and forgets. His rule is to clean up one thing <br/>\nbefore going onto the next. This epiphany didn&#39;t happen overnight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;This is not a dictator, we always consider our children&#39;s desires, and often <br/>\n&gt;change accordingly.

It was at the library.  I have notes from the book and I<br/>\nlook them over frequently to remind myself.  If the kids are keeping you<br/>\nawake late at night and you are pregnant, that&#39;s gotta be bad for you. <br/>\nMaybe you could ask the kids to help you find a solution, like to video<br/>\ntape the show and watch it the next day?  I own these silly-putty-like<br/>\nearplugs that help me get to sleep at night when my husband and kids stay<br/>\nup late.  About not wanting to go out, perhaps ask them to help you find<br/>\na solution, like they get to go somewhere they want after you go to your<br/>\nstuff.  About the laundry/sewing/stairs area, something we have done when<br/>\nthere is an ongoing problem of the kids not respecting my boundaries is<br/>\nthat I discuss possible solutions with each child individually, then we<br/>\ndecide all together which solutions to keep and what not to keep, then we<br/>\nwrite it down in a family agreement book and everyone signs it.  It is<br/>\namazing.  The first time ever that my children have stopped eating on my<br/>\nbed while watching tv.  They follow it more strictly than I do.  They are<br/>\nproud of their agreements.<br/>\nRemember, you are not in a war.  Your children and you are not<br/>\nadversaries.  You are not a victim, and it is not necessary to get<br/>\ncontrol of your children.  You will find wonderful methods in that book<br/>\nfor just the kinds of things you described.<br/>\nI just have to say, and I hope I&#39;m not sounding too offensive in this,<br/>\nbut, you might want to start putting their clothes away, picking up the<br/>\nstairs, and clearing the area in the sewing/laundry part that gets in<br/>\nyour way.  Change is progressive, and they may not be ready to change all<br/>\nthe areas you&#39;ve mentioned at once.  So until that time comes, you may<br/>\nwant to do what is necessary to help you live safely.  After all, seven<br/>\nand nine is really not that old.  They may be overwhelmed by the mess. <br/>\nIf it overwhelms you, I&#39;m sure it overwhelms them.  Try sitting in the<br/>\nmiddle of the messy room and saying, &quot;Hand me this, hand me that, now,<br/>\nwhere should this go?&quot;  That&#39;s what I do with mine when they are feeling<br/>\noverwhelmed with a mess.  Even my fourteen year old gets overwhelmed when<br/>\nhis room is messy now and then.  Also, fresh air and exercise is great<br/>\nfor making kids tired at night.  You might want to go for a walk every<br/>\nafternoon or something like that to use up some of their energy.<br/>\nAll right, I&#39;m done finally.  I know you are not me and you need to<br/>\nfigure out and weigh out your own ideas.  Maybe these suggestions will<br/>\nspark your imagination to come up with some of your own creative<br/>\nsolutions.<br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94797851,"authorName":"Karin","from":"&quot;Karin&quot; &lt;curtkar@...&gt;","profile":"kc85022","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] unparenting (sort of)","postDate":"1016576870","msgId":32780,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDgwMWMxY2Y5NSQ0ZTdlZTNlMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBnb2R6aWxsYT4=","referencesHeader":"PEYzMDExeUVYVUlFQU9lSWlHWGkwMDAwNTUwYUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":32777,"nextInTopic":32783,"prevInTime":32779,"nextInTime":32781,"topicId":32777,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Stacy Finch wrote: The problem is with the basement level.

Sorry this is so long.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Stacy,<br/>\nYou say the family room in the basement is their area. That is where all their stuff is and the room is always trashed. You also said that you allow them to keep their rooms as they like, but you don&#39;t mind it as much because you don&#39;t have to see it. So, it seems to me like they feel the family room is just another extension of their room (with toys and games in it) and since they can keep their rooms messy, the feel comfortable enough to keep their &quot;area&quot; messy, too. I understand that you must also use the family room for laundry and sewing, so the mess really bothers you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could explain how much this bothers you (I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already done that :-) and that you&#39;d like them to help you come up with a solution. Maybe they have some ideas of their own in this situation? If it were me, I would suggest a day, maybe once a week, where you and your kids go down to the room and clean it up together. I always find that when I&#39;m doing it with them, everybody is much happier and willing to help. If they are participating in some of the cleaning, they may be more willing to keep it cleaner in the future. But, at least it would be cleaned once a week so it might stay relatively clean.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with this!<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] unparenting (sort of)","postDate":"1016569290","msgId":32783,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZhLjFjZjFjNGRjLjI5YzhmN2NhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":32780,"nextInTopic":32790,"prevInTime":32782,"nextInTime":32784,"topicId":32777,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is so definitely about parenting!!!

The boys don&#39;t have a bedtime. <br/>\nThey <br/>\nlike to watch &quot;Gargoyles&quot; which comes on from 11:00-12:00am.

Especially with adjoining walls to other <br/>\nfamilies.  It&#39;s probably more than a need, there might be a legal requirement <br/>\nto keep quiet after a certain time.    Tell them they CAN&#39;T be really noisy, <br/>\neven if they were adults.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the neighbors complain, you could be dealing with social services.  Tell <br/>\nthem that.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;<br/>\nAnother problem is that they never want to go out. Occassionally I need to <br/>\nrun errands or would like to participate in a local group (Families for <br/>\nNatural Living).

But the nicer you are to them about doing things <br/>\nyou don&#39;t want to do, and the clearer you make to them that you really want <br/>\nto do something, the more cooperative they should (theoretically) be.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how much prior resentment there is to overcome.  What&#39;s wrong with <br/>\nmaking the trip attractive to everyone?  If my husbandted to stop for food or <br/>\nice cream, should he say &quot;NO, that would be a bribe&quot;?   Is it a reward for <br/>\ndoing something unpleasant?  If so, so what?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve bribed kids from time to time and I don&#39;t feel a bit guilty.  I have <br/>\nvivid memories of my mom telling me what and how to do and NOW because I SAID <br/>\nso.  That&#39;s wrong.  But no one member of the family should hold the rest <br/>\nhostage.  And the one with the power and money has the ability to distribute <br/>\npower and money for the good of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Thirdly is the issue of the clutter.

Did they leave toys on the stairs after you went to sleep?  <br/>\nThey will care about what they care about, and if they&#39;re too young to <br/>\nunderstand that toys can&#39;t safely be left on the steps, then they&#39;re too <br/>\nyoung to play on the steps.  If it were me, I would them that if they can&#39;t <br/>\ntake the toys away with them, you need a no-toys-on-steps EVER rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t had a problem with stuff on stairs except for me leaving <br/>\nto-be-filed books leaned up against the wall on steps on the way to the <br/>\nlibrary (and I know of no incidents of them falling over or of people <br/>\nstepping on them) or me putting other people&#39;s &quot;take it downstairs&quot; stuff on <br/>\nthe top of the banister.

This morning I tripped over toys trying to get to the <br/>\nlaundry closet. I&#39;m pregnant and my center of balance is changing, so it is <br/>\nmore difficult to manuever the obstacle course. My s.o. and I are neat. The <br/>\nmain level (kitchen, dining, living and office area) is typically clutter <br/>\nfree as is our bedroom. Dishes and laundry are done. (I don&#39;t buy into <br/>\nflylady that if we are clutter free and follow our routines, our children <br/>\nwill too!) I have conceded to the clutter in their rooms. Their bedrooms are <br/>\na half level up from our bedroom and the uppermost level in the townhouse, <br/>\nso I don&#39;t have to see it. I won&#39;t put their laundry away. I put it in a <br/>\nbasket and they take it to their room. The problem is with the basement <br/>\nlevel. It contains a family room and laundry closet. This is their area. <br/>\nThere is a wall of shelves for their toys. There is a tv, game cube, videos, <br/>\nand computer. The room is always trashed.
