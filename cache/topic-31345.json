But in the computer industry one always has<br/>\ndangling out in front the option of getting rich, really rich like Bill<br/>\nGates and Steve Jobs did.  I don&#39;t exactly consider engineering to be<br/>\nartistic as much as creative.  I know the computer business since that<br/>\nis where I worked and where my friends and husband work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am reacting a lot to the fact that my DH has worked every day since<br/>\nmid-Nov. (He didn&#39;t work Christmas.) And I&#39;ve got another 5 or so weeks<br/>\nof it.  I&#39;m tired of his stress level and his exhaustion level.  I actually<br/>\nasked him if he&#39;d like to move out so we could have some peace and he<br/>\ncould work all the time with no interruptions!  He changed then but I can <br/>\ntell that it&#39;s hard on him to be calm when he&#39;s so stressed!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nCindy Ferguson<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85994576,"authorName":"Kolleen","from":"Kolleen &lt;Kolleen@...&gt;","profile":"kaydeecross","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: video game designer","postDate":"1012067426","msgId":31484,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMTI2MTc1MC5nMFFIbzBmWjAxNDg1NkBueWNzbXRwMW91dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":31420,"nextInTopic":31507,"prevInTime":31483,"nextInTime":31485,"topicId":31345,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
