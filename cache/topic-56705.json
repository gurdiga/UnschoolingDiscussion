But it has not always meant &quot; deer-meat&quot;. At<br/>\n&gt; first, it referred to the meat of any animal killed in the chase, which could<br/>\n&gt; include wild boar, hare, and rabbit as well as deer ( &quot;Hares are thought to<br/>\n&gt; nourish melancholy, yet they are eaten as venison, both roasted and boiled.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Fynes Moryson, An Itinerary, 1617.) This reflects the word´s origins, in Latin<br/>\n&gt; venatio, &quot;hunting game&quot;; a derivative of the verb venari, &quot;hunt&quot;. Signs of the<br/>\n&gt; modern narrowing-down in signification to &quot;deer-meat&quot; appear in the late 16th<br/>\n&gt; century ( &quot;Amongst the common sort of people, nothing is accounted venison but<br/>\n&gt; the flesh of red and fallow deer,&quot; John Manwood, A Treatise of the Laws of the<br/>\n&gt; Forest, 1598), but wider options remained open well into the 19th century ( &quot;<br/>\n&gt; a haunch of Kangaroo venison&quot; , Godfrey Mundy, Our Antipodes, 1852).In 1983,<br/>\n&gt; Broken Arrow Ranch worked with the USDA to refine the definition of &quot;venison&quot;<br/>\n&gt; for meat labeling purposes. After a great deal of research and discussion, it<br/>\n&gt; was agreed that the term &quot;venison&quot; could be used for labeling meat derived<br/>\n&gt; from members of the deer and antelope families.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So maybe that Gourmet&#39;s Guide would answer the other questions too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a whole bunch of stuff here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.towson.edu/~duncan/brmideng.html\">http://www.towson.edu/~duncan/brmideng.html</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Heavy borrowing from French occurred in two phases:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1.    1066-1250.

The heaviest borrowing from French occurred in this period<br/>\n&gt; because after about 1250 there were more French speakers who began speaking<br/>\n&gt; English--remember the loss of Normandy in 1204.

Please don&#39;t go. I need you and the rest of<br/>\nyou misfits to make me feel normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the stuff I read on this list hits so close to home. I wish we all<br/>\ncould climb the trees together with rainbow colored hair.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just east of Denver, CO where the trees are so small they couldn&#39;t<br/>\nhold my weight. I always wanted pink hair since before Missing Persons<br/>\nwas popular, but never had the guts. Well, I did dip the ends in pink<br/>\nonce when I was doing my daughter&#39;s hair, but it&#39;s just not the same. My<br/>\ndaughter&#39;s hair changes color on a regular basis, I&#39;m so proud. She could<br/>\nuse some unschooln friends cause the public school friends she has just<br/>\ndon&#39;t seem to fill her needs, and the homeschoolers round here might just<br/>\nthink we&#39;re freaks. My 15yo son freaked the other day about me not<br/>\nforcing him to do math all these years. I had to point out how he can do<br/>\nmath and if or when he needs to use it every day it&#39;ll come faster to<br/>\nhim, and how, as he stood there playing some riff on his guitar, he&#39;s<br/>\nlearned all these other wonderful things during the time &quot;I&#39;ve waisted&quot;<br/>\nnot forcing him to do math. I think I got my point across but he let me<br/>\nknow he&#39;ll still blame me for everything anyway. It&#39;ll always be &quot;Mom&#39;s<br/>\nfault&quot;, I can live with that. My youngest son is 12 and still isn&#39;t<br/>\ncomfortable reading, but he&#39;s not uncomfortable not reading:-). He knows<br/>\nso much about so many different things but hasn&#39;t learned too much, if<br/>\nany of it, from a book. We&#39;re big Simpsons fans, hell, we&#39;re big TV fans<br/>\nand the night owls at our house even watch South Park. We&#39;re not as<br/>\ntogether as some of you sound to be but we&#39;re doing ok. For these and<br/>\nmany more reasons, when I sit here and listen to what you&#39;re all saying I<br/>\nfeel at home. The timing of some of these posts are so perfect it&#39;s<br/>\nscary. <br/>\n<br/>\nPardon my run-on sentences, I had to get that out.<br/>\n  Sharon<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Joyce/Acceptable for Group?","postDate":"1043713953","msgId":56752,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5OS4xNGE1NzE3MC4yYjY3MjlhMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56747,"nextInTopic":56754,"prevInTime":56751,"nextInTime":56753,"topicId":56705,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/27/03 5:05:30 PM, litlrooh@comcast.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-606870593\">In a message dated 1/27/03 5:05:30 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:litlrooh@...\">litlrooh@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Can anyone refresh my memory on what the letters in F*CK stand for?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it is an acronym that came from some kind of royal decree or <br/>\nsomething. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some made-up things, but it&#39;s not true.
