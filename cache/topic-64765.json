It developed into a cough. a very bad cough.<br/>\nOne morning I awoke with a horrible pain in my back right side. I thought it was my kidney. Brianna & I were at my doctor&#39;s office 5 minutes before she got there! <br/>\nThe coughing had caused muscle spasms - severe!!<br/>\nI was told to spend no more than 60 - 75 minutes per day out of bed. In bed - I was to stay flat....as in no sitting up. That my friends is hell. There is nothing to do for 23 hours per day flat on your back (well, there is , but I home school :)<br/>\nHow long can you hold a book up?? <br/>\nEven watching TV was hard and very boring!<br/>\nIf there is a hell - this would definitely be a version!<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, April 13, 2003 5:30 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] afterlife/afterlives/today-lives<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 4/13/2003 4:47:53 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grlynbl@...\">grlynbl@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Hell could be many different things to different people, just like <br/>\n  &gt; Heaven could be.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Was it Plato who said each person has his own version of hell?
