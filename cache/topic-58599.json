I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1443325243\">Hi Sheila,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 5 kids were adopted, 3 through the foster system.  We had a total of 14<br/>\nfoster kids so the behaviors you describe are very familiar to me.  I think<br/>\nit is important to remember that often these kids are spending so much<br/>\nenergy protecting themselves from perceived threats (like &quot;I love you and<br/>\nwant you to be part of the family&quot;) that they don&#39;t have the energy left to<br/>\nlearn new behaviors.  I believe that stressing kids to &quot;improve&quot; before they<br/>\nfeel safe and have developed a bond is a recipe for disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarsie came to us at 1 day of age.  Her bio mother is retarded and<br/>\npsychotic.  Her bio father is &quot;slow&quot; and abusive.  2 siblings had lived in<br/>\nour home previously, both were retarded with attachment problems and one was<br/>\npsychotic.  At ages 2 and 3, these kids had to be placed in special<br/>\ntherapeutic residences because they were so destructive and out of control<br/>\n(sleeping only a couple of hours per night, attacking other kids without any<br/>\nknown provocation, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 5 months of age, Marsie still couldn&#39;t turn over and just seemed somewhat<br/>\n&quot;behind&quot;.  I took her to an &quot;occupational&quot; therapist who gave me the best<br/>\nadvice I&#39;ve ever been given.  She said &quot;Don&#39;t worry about dirt or germs with<br/>\nthis kid.  Let her do what she needs to do to learn.&quot;  So Marsie grew older<br/>\nwith ready access to anything she wanted, even the kitchen garbage (we just<br/>\nwashed her good when she was through), even fire ants (she can pick them up<br/>\nand let them crawl all over her and never gets bit).  Marsie is now 6yo and<br/>\njust smart as a whip.  She is learning to read off and on and has been<br/>\nplaying with multiplication stuff the last couple of days.  She does have a<br/>\ntemper but rarely completely loses it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is so far past where her siblings were at her age.  I truly believe it<br/>\nis because she felt safe and accepted.  So as a foster mom, adoptive mom,<br/>\nunschooling mom and Master&#39;s level therapist, I would advise that you work<br/>\nonly on your relationship with your son.  Do nothing, absolutely nothing,<br/>\nthat will damage it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58593,"nextTopicId":58600}}
