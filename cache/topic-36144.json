Never said.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s been implied is that once you recognize that children can be<br/>\ntrusted<br/>\nto learn the &quot;academic&quot; things then it&#39;s hard not to question why kids<br/>\ncan&#39;t<br/>\nlearn the rest of the things they&#39;ll need in life by living life.**<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, the crux of unschooling is avoiding forced learning because I<br/>\nbelieve forced learning damages a person&#39;s natural desire to learn and<br/>\ncan cause him to despise and resist the subject matter being forced on<br/>\nhim.  I believe that making a child do math worksheets is likely to<br/>\ndampen their overall enthusiasm for learning as well as making them<br/>\ndetest math.  Heck, someone could make me hate strawberries (yum) if<br/>\ns/heforce-fed me too many of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nExtending this, yes, forcing or nagging a child to pick up toys can<br/>\ncause them to hate picking up toys.  I see the connection.  But, I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink my child has a natural love of tidiness that I am likely to<br/>\ndamage.  Chores are a separate issue for me.  Still, I try to keep them<br/>\nfrom being loathsome.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36136,"nextTopicId":36148}}
