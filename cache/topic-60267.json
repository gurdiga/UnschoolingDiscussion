There is only so much<br/>\nthe eye can take in {at least the way most of us were taught to<br/>\nread} I think speed reading is a whole another technique.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you {like i do sometimes ~ sorry} tend to go on and on without<br/>\nbreaks people get board. <br/>\nI tend to get frustrated having to re find my place {or going back<br/>\nto try to understand what the author meant} again and again in a<br/>\nlong non-spaced email.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I find if I read and reread my letter before i send I can catch<br/>\nthose things that might offend {which is never my intent}. Since<br/>\nmost of our body language tells a person how we feel, email can be<br/>\nmisleading to what the person is trying to say. This is the main<br/>\nthing I keep in mind when reading an email, especially if I tend to<br/>\ndisagree with their views. Overlooking this {or when someone is just<br/>\nplain trying to start something ~ LOL} is how I feel most &quot;list<br/>\nwars&quot; are started.<br/>\nI looked up on google for links, some might go a bit off topic but<br/>\nhope they help :)<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thewritemarket.com/mcnn/keel.shtml\">http://www.thewritemarket.com/mcnn/keel.shtml</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.emailaddresses.com/guide_etiquette.htm\">http://www.emailaddresses.com/guide_etiquette.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://email.about.com/cs/netiquettetips/\">http://email.about.com/cs/netiquettetips/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bschool.unc.edu/communication/email.html\">http://www.bschool.unc.edu/communication/email.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
