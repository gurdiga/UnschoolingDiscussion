I have seen school be a lifeline for kids from this type of background.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, such thinking can backfire.  I grew up in an upper middle class alcoholic home, and was alternately abused and ignored.  However, school was no refuge for me.  I absolutely hated school, for various reasons, and it was many years of torture and trauma for me.  I never did well there.  I would have done much better left to my own devices, since most of what I learned, I taught myself.  I did not have a refuge anywhere, except a few spots where I would go and hide by myself (like under the front porch) and there was no one that I could trust.  My inner city school was a dangerous and unwelcoming place and there were no saviours within the staff.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13897,"nextTopicId":14085}}
