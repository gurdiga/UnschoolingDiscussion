I needed to look at myself and my<br/>\nattitudes- here I am thinking  &quot;I didn&#39;t make THAT painting mess!- why<br/>\nshould I always have to clean up others stuff&quot;- and SURPRISE, everyone<br/>\nlittler than me is thinking the same thing...(love this CC stuff)<br/>\n<br/>\nFundamentally important is for me to maintain a helpful, co-operative<br/>\nattitude myself.  Here is an example of something that happened while I was<br/>\nrelearning (lordy! it never ends!) this stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we were hanging out in the yard, and Chloe (13) goes and gets the weed<br/>\neater and proceeds to trim up the edges.  &quot;How great&quot; I think, &quot;I never get<br/>\naround to that..&quot;.   Well anyway, later, I see that she has left the<br/>\ntrimmer in the middle of the lawn and it is still plugged in (mess)- she is<br/>\nin the house and I caught myself just as I was about to yell back to the<br/>\nhouse- no joke- &quot;Gosh darn it Chloe!  the weed wacker is still out here-<br/>\nget out here and pick it up...&quot;  BUT!  instead I thought stuff like, &quot;if it<br/>\nwas my friend- I would love to put it away for her if she forgot...Im out<br/>\nhere- why can&#39;t I do it, it is so simple...&quot; stuff like that<br/>\n<br/>\n(yeah now there is a &quot;chore&quot; mentality, isnt it- you are right there<br/>\nlooking at the &quot;chore&quot; (yeah, and it is something like,&quot;put your cup in the<br/>\ndishwasher after you use it&quot;)- your kid is like, at the next door<br/>\nnieghbor&#39;s house, and you walk to were they are and say, &quot;well get over<br/>\nhere and do YOUR chore!&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway, SO- I just gladly, open heartedly put the tool away thinking, &quot;that<br/>\nwas so nice of her to trim up- I am glad to help with putting away&quot;  And<br/>\nwhen I went in the house- I said, &quot;OH! Chloe- I put away the weed eater for<br/>\nyou :-)&quot; she goes, &quot;oh thanks, mom. I totally forgot&quot;.  AHH!  It felt so<br/>\ngood to just have that warm, helping feeling towards her...that is the<br/>\nfeeling I want to have all the time!  And SURPRISE, everyone seemed to<br/>\nadopt the same sweet attitude---modeling, modeling, modeling, (you guys<br/>\naren&#39;t surprised at all, hu?).  But I think the most important thing is<br/>\nthat I was happier. I was being who I want to be, kind and warm and openly<br/>\ngiving.  Then I am happy- I like myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n(yipes, sounds like I am Mother Thereasa!  rrriiiiiiight!  I AM the woman!-<br/>\ndon&#39;t forget that list!)<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\nBronwen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24066,"nextTopicId":24297}}
