Also, when<br/>\nbaby fell asleep did<br/>\nyou put her in a crib or ... what did you do?  I&#39;m just curious.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how one person did it.  I didn&#39;t know the term AP at the time.  I<br/>\nchose to never give my second child supplemental milk feedings (ie, no<br/>\nbottles).  I have no regrets!  That first year went by so quick!  My<br/>\nhusband and I are still very much in love, in spite of having little time<br/>\n&quot;alone together&quot; when our children were young.  And yes, I did put my<br/>\nbaby down when she slept.  Put her down sometimes when she was awake too!<br/>\nMaybe there is a reason God made men and women different.  If infants<br/>\nneed Mom the most, could it be God made a mistake?  Or was God&#39;s plan to<br/>\nhave a father nuture a mother so that the mother could nurture the<br/>\ninfant?<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nBooks Fall Open, You Fall In<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homestead.com/gateskate\">http://www.homestead.com/gateskate</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>\nTry Juno Web: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"The White&#39;s","from":"&quot;The White&#39;s&quot; &lt;jwwjr@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"rQrTNFYnsvc_n4GwsRdV7ukJkJEm4Jg9OK_Tayy_SBitkICO-gAIMtTrODpPjw0exlristdP_g-DP8L9W0S7z-LKs9IzRT7e","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"attachment parenting","postDate":"938918026","msgId":3531,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMzguMzUzMS45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3650,"prevInTime":3530,"nextInTime":3532,"topicId":3531,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am very apple shaped & the both of my children spent lots of time in the sling, especially my youngest.

Melanie, I<br/>\nthink it will be easier once the baby is here because right now you easily<br/>\ntire due to the pregnancy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf baby is in bed with you when it wakes up hungry, you don&#39;t even really<br/>\nwake up, you just roll over & help the baby get started then you are back to<br/>\nsleep...the baby nurses until full & also falls asleep.  Next morning you<br/>\nare not tired because you&#39;ve had plenty of sleep.  And the baby never gets<br/>\nmad from having to wait until it wakes you up enough to get to him/her.<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I want to point out that slings seem to work better for pear-shaped women<br/>\n </span></blockquote>than for apple-shaped woman.  (An apple-shaped woman has hips that are not<br/>\nvery big and a waist that is not very small.  It&#39;s harder to carry a larger<br/>\nbaby on your hip if you are built like this.)  Other types of carriers may<br/>\nwork better for a woman who isn&#39;t pear -shaped.&lt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91907,"nextTopicId":91787}}
