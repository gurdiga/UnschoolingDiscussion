I have used homeopathy successfully for several <br/>\nhealth issues in myself and my children.  I believe that it can be an <br/>\nvaluable part of our health care.  It is not a cure for my lupus.  This <br/>\ndisease did not begin as a result of emotional stress or trauma and <br/>\nunfortunately it won&#39;t be cured by homeopathy.  I don&#39;t mean to sound too <br/>\nprickly about it, but believe me - if it were that simple, I and many many <br/>\nothers with lupus and other serious conditions would all be well by now.   It <br/>\nis hard for those of us with incurable illnesses to hear someone say that our <br/>\nemotions brought it on and that there is an answer out there.  It makes our <br/>\nsuffering seem less valid.  I would not be surprised if homeopathy eased some <br/>\nof the discomfort that many sufferers feel, however.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate the kindness behind your post.<br/>\n<br/>\nKIM</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7513,"nextTopicId":7516}}
