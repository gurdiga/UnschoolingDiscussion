I also have seen plenty of<br/>\n&gt; moms who just think they do.  Maybe a kid gets grumpy if he watches TV<br/>\n&gt; all day.  But maybe he&#39;s grumpy because he didn&#39;t get anything to eat.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe he didn&#39;t feel good in the first place and that&#39;s why he chose to<br/>\n&gt; sit and watch TV.  Maybe he chose TV because he couldn&#39;t think of<br/>\n&gt; something else and he&#39;s grumpy because he&#39;s frustrated.  Maybe he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; grumpy because mom keeps saying &quot;are you just going to sit there all<br/>\n&gt; day??&quot;    I think it&#39;s easy to assume it&#39;s the TV because after all, we<br/>\n&gt; all  *know*  TV is bad for kids!( they need limits!)    On an unschooling<br/>\n&gt; list, I don&#39;t see the harm in asking, - are you sure it was the TV--<br/>\n&gt; maybe you didn&#39;t think of this other reason.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also know,  when our decisions are questioned all the time, it&#39;s easy<br/>\n&gt; to become defensive.  Many of us have friends, family members and even<br/>\n&gt; partners who don&#39;t support our choice to unschool.  One more person<br/>\n&gt; asking a question can feel like an attack,  when it was really just meant<br/>\n&gt; to be a question,  something to consider.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No matter what anyone on this list, or anywhere else,  says or thinks or<br/>\n&gt; implies,  we all still have the ability to make our own decisions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Controlling kids is a huge issue.  Some people use their religion as an<br/>\n&gt; excuse,  some people just like the power, some people just never think<br/>\n&gt; about it.  Telling someone else what to do, what to think, what to eat,<br/>\n&gt; what to wear, how to behave--these are control issues.  Questioning them<br/>\n&gt; seems appropriate on an unschooling list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know this one true thing.  My own son is delighted to be alive.  He&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; happy to be a kid. He has no issues, no problems.   He is free to make<br/>\n&gt; his own choices.<br/>\n&gt; When someone says their child is unhappy or unhealthy,  I know there<br/>\n&gt; could be a million reasons for it, but I&#39;ve seen so many examples of the<br/>\n&gt; reason being control of the child&#39;s life by the parent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Deb L<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Marbleface@xxx.xxx","from":"Marbleface@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"cGN5KH5BtboYaWlqN3ZDKXB06119bBnlAxhhnV4MV7zdWyGTsaWiMuGUyOFUN7rNAwQrl37mBxH2","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Control","postDate":"945868516","msgId":5394,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNDguNTM5NC45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5393,"nextInTopic":28027,"prevInTime":5393,"nextInTime":5395,"topicId":5374,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/22/1999 4:45:11 AM !!!First Boot!!!, swoodall@bluecrab.org writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-916783507\">In a message dated 12/22/1999 4:45:11 AM !!!First Boot!!!, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:swoodall@...\">swoodall@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  have a child that loves to be<br/>\n controlling in nearly everything.<br/>\n <br/>\n Is she a first-born?<br/>\n <br/>\n Sara &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy &quot;we are not sure what she will do when she grows up but we know she will <br/>\nbe IN CHARGE&quot; daughter is the second child.   <br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Susan and Theodore","from":"&quot;Susan and Theodore&quot; &lt;Stuff@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"IsPONZQGMOQ-tgNK_QdV_xFWEOE-ajfoT5wHFigqVnhAhNhN0BIFd11LKufspET7Sy_coUpK8bvXhc6zAP4SFp0UwlJpUkliifk6Qz_Hi4KO","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Control","postDate":"945847550","msgId":5393,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNDcuNTM5My45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5392,"nextInTopic":5394,"prevInTime":5392,"nextInTime":5394,"topicId":5374,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"YUP definitely know what you mean I have found it to be one of my most difficult tasks!!

She is able to play, guide the<br/>\nplay, watch over the littlies, and still take breaks to come in and join in<br/>\nthe adult conversation, something which has become very important to her<br/>\nthese last few months.  We have all recognized her strong personality all<br/>\nher life and only ask that she do things in a positive manner and that she<br/>\ntake responsibility for what she is choosing to do--no martyrdom allowed.<br/>\n(No, she does not have to take care of the &quot;babies&quot; ALL the time, but if she<br/>\nis choosing to, she needs to correct and redirect them in a positive way;<br/>\nNo, she does not have to feed ALL the animals, someone else will do it if<br/>\nshe does not want to, however, she is not going to be able to harass them<br/>\ntil they do).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy situation is probably quite different from yours.  I am having to remind<br/>\nmyself to &quot;let&quot; her help me, or even ask for her help, when doing things<br/>\nlike cooking and setting up the meal.  I think I integrated my own children<br/>\ninto being an equal part of all that was done in the house, kitchen, etc.,<br/>\nmuch sooner and easier that I am with my grands.  I find myself doing it<br/>\neasily enough when only one or two are here, but still a little overwhelmed<br/>\nwhen needing to quickly feed 11 (the littlest is still just nursing!).  In<br/>\nshort, she is much faster and more efficient than I am now and seems to need<br/>\nthe recognition of her ability.  So I am in the process of consulting her<br/>\nfirst (and the others as they come forth and are interested) now when meal<br/>\nplanning, day planning, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese kids are all in homeschooling families.  It is so nice to be able to<br/>\nbe a part of their day-to-day lives and watch them grow.  However,<br/>\ngrandparenting does present as many challenges as parenting did/does.

But they have brought up a question for me.  We often are quick<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; decide that parents are controlling.  Yet, I have a child that loves to be<br/>\n&gt; controlling in nearly everything.  I&#39;m not sure what has happened to make<br/>\n&gt; her this way but she seems to really need to control things around her.<br/>\n&gt; Everything, from what she learns (which I count as a good thing) to who<br/>\n&gt; holds the book someone is reading (which drives me nuts and provides lots<br/>\n&gt; of opportunities to keep the sibling rivalry going with her younger<br/>\n&gt; sister.)
