My in-laws just can&#39;t figure this out---but then they&#39;ll wash their <br/>\nkids&#39; mouths out with soap for saying &quot;stupid&quot;! <br/>\n<br/>\nMy nephew (12ish?) had his mouth washed out for something (can&#39;t remember <br/>\nwhich word)---his mom was FURIOUS. She told him to &quot;think&quot; about it and tell her <br/>\nwhere he heard it. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom HER!<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked whether she washed her own mouth out! She didn&#39;t *get* it!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys are WELCOME to use whatever language they&#39;re comfortable with. They <br/>\nboth learned quickly when it&#39;s acceptable---and don&#39;t hide it. They&#39;re just <br/>\n*aware*.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly, the foul-mouthed---but generally acceptable<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 5/26/2003 10:02:18 AM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:treegoddess@...\">treegoddess@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We are really relaxed about &quot;cuss&quot; words here.  The only stipulation we <br/>\n&gt; have is that they shouldn&#39;t be used<br/>\n&gt; for name calling (any more than it&#39;s ok to call each other stupid, <br/>\n&gt; dummy, etc.).  Yesterday we were at my<br/>\n&gt; sister&#39;s and my 5yo niece came running in to tell me that my 4yo said <br/>\n&gt; &quot;ass&quot;.  I asked her if he called her an<br/>\n&gt; ass and she said no and that he fell off the end of the slide and bumped <br/>\n&gt; it.  I told her that it was ok and she<br/>\n&gt; gave me an amazed, puzzled look.  I let her know that her Uncle and I <br/>\n&gt; let the him say that and she was like, &quot;Wow.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Later on I was talking to my sister and cracking up over my niece&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; amazement.  My sister told me that her DD<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t head straight back outside, but made a beeline to her and dreamy <br/>\n&gt; like asked, &quot;Mama, can I say bad words<br/>\n&gt; too?&quot;  LOL  Sis told her no.... which is ironic (is that the right <br/>\n&gt; word?) because I don&#39;t know anyone who swears<br/>\n&gt; more than my sister.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; TreeGoddess<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70790,"nextTopicId":70810}}
