The library here had those, plus a couple of<br/>\nbright-colored books along the same lines that appealed to my son more.  One<br/>\nof them had us make ooblik, which was huge fun.  We kept it until it<br/>\nspoiled, which took a LONG time.  I&#39;ll put the recipe below if you&#39;re<br/>\ninterested.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOoblik: a substance with properties of both a liquid and a solid.<br/>\n<br/>\nDump one box of cornstarch into a shallow pan (cake pan or such).  Add<br/>\nwater, a little bit at a time, stirring, until it sticks together in a very<br/>\nhard to stir mess.  Ditch the spoon, and keep mixing in a little bit more<br/>\nwater until it is just runny enough to drip from your fingers, yet is firm<br/>\nwhen pressed on in the pan.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to hold it!  Slap it in the pan.  It&#39;s fun!<br/>\nTim and I mixed foodcoloring into the water first, so our ooblik was an<br/>\nfunky shade of greenish purple.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76245,"nextTopicId":76305}}
