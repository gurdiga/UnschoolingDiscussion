There are still adults searching for their<br/>\nancestry. Aborigines traditionally have very complicated family<br/>\nrelationships based not only on blood but also spirit relatives, with<br/>\ncertain taboos about intermarriage, that have been charted - some of the<br/>\nancient artworks that seem to be abstracts are &quot;family trees&quot;. The<br/>\ndisruption to these relationships has been very painful for the people,<br/>\na deliberate attempt to destroy the culture and spiritual life of the<br/>\ntribes. Nor are they a homogenous group, but many tribes now see<br/>\nthemselves as one nation politically. The land rights movement has an<br/>\nironic twist. It turns out that many traditional lands, returned to the<br/>\ntraditional owners by the government, are the ones with highly valuable<br/>\nminerals (esp.
