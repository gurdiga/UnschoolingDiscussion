However, it is possible to look at that fact and come<br/>\n&gt; to an opposite conclusion about what to do about it.  It would be<br/>\n&gt; entirely possible to come to the conclusion that the right thing to do<br/>\n&gt; would be to stop euthenizing.  Let the &quot;unwanted&quot; cats go free and<br/>\n&gt; live in the wild.  Some will die, some will not.  Either way, they are<br/>\n&gt; a natural part of the food chain and survival of the fittest will come<br/>\n&gt; back into play.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;  However, if they decided they wanted to go out and<br/>\n&gt; shot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; squirrels and hawks and everyother thing that moved, the anwer would<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;that&#39;s where your choices end and my parental responsibilities kick<br/>\n&gt; in.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t allow my children to shoot animals just for the fun of<br/>\n&gt; shooting them.  However, if they were shooting squirrels and wanted me<br/>\n&gt; to fix them for supper, that would be great!  I&#39;ve eaten squirrel meat<br/>\n&gt; and it&#39;s quite good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am curious however as to how your religious beliefs cover this.<br/>\n&gt; The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fundamentalist xtians I know don&#39;t approve of animals being used as<br/>\n&gt; how-to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or science projects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I believe that we are caretakers of the earth.  I have really become<br/>\n&gt; convicted lately of all the garbage we throw out that will never<br/>\n&gt; decompose, or will possibly decompose thousands of years from now.  I<br/>\n&gt; am hugely in favor of recycling.  I also believe that we are to care<br/>\n&gt; for animals.  We are also to use them for our benefit. &quot;Rule over<br/>\n&gt; them&quot; is the exact wording.  We may eat them, make clothes out of<br/>\n&gt; them, conduct experiments on them.  Dd also wants to breed rabbits for<br/>\n&gt; medical labs and I have no problems with that.  That doesn&#39;t mean we<br/>\n&gt; go shooting everything that moves just for the fun of killing.  That<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t being a good caretaker.  It does mean that when there is a<br/>\n&gt; legitimate use for an animal, you use the animal for whatever it is<br/>\n&gt; you need.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
