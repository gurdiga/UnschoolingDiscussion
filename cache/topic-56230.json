Both armies sponsored revivals and prayer meetings. Here is <br/>\na little sample from the diary of a Southern Methodist chaplain:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;There was preaching in Dalton every night but four, for four months; and in <br/>\nthe camps all around the city, preaching and prayer meetings occurred every <br/>\nnight. The soldiers erected stands, improvised seats, and even built log <br/>\nchurches, where they worshipped God in spirit and in truth. The result was <br/>\nthat thousands were happily converted and were prepared for the future that <br/>\nawaited them. Officers and enlisted men alike were brought under religious <br/>\ninfluence.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd of that article:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; They comforted the Southern whites not only by telling them that they were <br/>\nsuperior to blacks, but also that they were morally superior to Northern <br/>\nwhites, who were less religious than they.

And their heritage lives on. Today we are still confronted with <br/>\nSouthern Evangelicals who claim that belief in the literal truth of the <br/>\nBible, the subordination of women, the physical abuse of children and a <br/>\nnarrow view of the role of the state as merely a system of criminal justice <br/>\nhave all been ordained by God.
