I&#39;m 67 and have only contempt for such arrogance<br/>\nand selfishness. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe seems to want to &quot;celebrate&quot; himself, not his family, and especially not<br/>\nthe children. The planning is rude. I feel sure that you are not the only<br/>\none who is offended... what? -- your kids are not good enough to enjoy a<br/>\nmeal with your fatherinlaw&#39;s friends? Someone should convince (perhaps his<br/>\nwife) him to include the children. If that cannot be done, and you must<br/>\nattend, then in order to spare the children the indignity of being used and<br/>\nsnubbed, leave them home, give them a special activity that they would like<br/>\n(with supervision as required) and go to the party and come home the same<br/>\nnight. Don&#39;t stay for the night.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarring that, I also like your idea of joining your kids for the evening<br/>\ninstead of staying at the adult-only affair. It is sure to be a bore.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38204,"nextTopicId":38208}}
