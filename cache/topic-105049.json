At about 8, I watched without a parent in sight and <br/>\nwas traumatised. There are still scenes stuck inside my 40-year-old <br/>\nadult head that I may have been better off never having seen, or at <br/>\nleast not alone at 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there is a lot of gray area between shielding and forcing a <br/>\nchild to watch it alone.  My husband and I both had good memories of <br/>\nwatching Roots as children.  It had a lasting effect on me, <br/>\npersonally, but not in a bad or traumatized way.  Perhaps it was my <br/>\npersonality (and I think I was older than 8) or perhaps it was <br/>\nbecause I didn&#39;t have to watch it alone without adult input. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband and I recently got the first part of Roots from Netflix <br/>\nand our children were welcome to watch it with us or not.  My 9yo, <br/>\nwho often chooses not to see anything blatantly violent, was fine <br/>\nwith watching it.  I warned him about the part that I personally <br/>\nfind the most disturbing- which is the part where Kunta Kinte gets <br/>\nwhipped until he says his name is Toby- and I let him know when it <br/>\nwas coming so he could leave the room or close his eyes.   He&#39;s very <br/>\naware of what he can handle and what he can&#39;t.  He wanted no part of <br/>\nThe Passion of the Christ when his stronger-stomached older brother <br/>\nwatched it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as perspective on slavery- we had not too long ago read a <br/>\nbook together called How I Found the Strong about a boy who helps a <br/>\nrunaway slave, which my sons found fascinating and which led to lots <br/>\nof discussion, so maybe the timing for them just happened to be <br/>\nright.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 9yo, the one I was most concerned about, was the most <br/>\ndisappointed of all of us that parts 2 and 3 were damaged and no <br/>\nlonger available from netflix.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPatti</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] much and too much information  Re: Food Choices & Food Allergies","postDate":"1112326712","msgId":105075,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYxOGUyNWZkZjExMjE3NmE1YzRhYTRhNjQ5Mjc2MTZiQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDQyNENBMzkyLjUwMDAzMDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDE5Zi4zMGIzNGU0Ny4yZjdkYTk3OUBhb2wuY29tPiA8ZDI4YWU4YzEwMzY0ODNhOGE2YTExMzE2MmFkY2ExOGRAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4gPDQyNENBMzkyLjUwMDAzMDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":105072,"nextInTopic":105088,"prevInTime":105074,"nextInTime":105076,"topicId":105049,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
