We&#39;re in a rental house next door to my in-laws while we look for  a <br/>\nhouse.  For the most part, we have stayed busy and positive but last  night Brenna <br/>\nand I just gave in for awhile. We were both close to tears sitting  on the <br/>\ncouch  and we looked at each other and at the same time said...&quot;This  stinks!&quot;   <br/>\nIt&#39;s been hard.<br/>\n <br/>\nI miss my mom, my sister, our house, my running trails, all the  kids from <br/>\nthe neighborhood running in and out, our pool, my husband (he had  a home office <br/>\nin Florida), how to get to all my familiar places....... Most of  all, I miss <br/>\nthe joy in my children as they ran back and forth visiting and  hanging out <br/>\nwith their cousins. (Whine, Whine, Whine...I&#39;m done  now..&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n <br/>\nWe planned it for a very long time and I was sure it was the right  decision. <br/>\n The reality of it has been so much more difficult than I could  have ever <br/>\nimagined.  I get up every day so determined to do just what you  have said above <br/>\nand so far haven&#39;t been very successful..<br/>\n <br/>\nMoving and change are just hard.  I&#39;m realizing that moving with older  <br/>\nchildren (12 and 16) has different challenges in meeting new people. It&#39;s  not <br/>\nquite as easy when you can&#39;t just go to a park day to meet other  families.  I <br/>\nkeep telling my kids it takes time but I think at any given  moment we would all <br/>\nmove back to Florida.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m so glad we are unschooling as we can sleep in, explore, discover our  new <br/>\nsurrounding to our hearts content.  We&#39;re fortunate to have another  <br/>\nunschooling family close by who have welcomed and included us...(Thanks  Sandra!)  I <br/>\nlook at the mountains and I really don&#39;t miss Florida at  all.  It was never <br/>\nhome to me and this is where I want to be.  I do  however, miss our lives there. <br/>\n I&#39;m realizing that I have to grieve and let  go of that before I can truly <br/>\nbe joyful here.<br/>\n <br/>\nI know all the right things to do and we&#39;re doing them....I just want  things <br/>\nto be better right now!! &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m hoping things get easier for  you soon, <br/>\nDiana, and that you enjoy your new home.<br/>\n <br/>\nGail (not known for either her patience or adapting to change but is  working <br/>\non both :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194790463,"authorName":"diana","from":"&quot;diana&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"In need of PEACE","postDate":"1127308315","msgId":108427,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRncm02citxbXAzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":108429,"prevInTime":108426,"nextInTime":108428,"topicId":108427,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"aaaahhhhh, struggling with peace in my home, in my children...

The move is my responsibility alone and the burden <br/>\nhas not left me with much physical energy, let alone the <br/>\nemotional space to deal with the *now* with my kids.  <br/>\nHayden, 7, is the most visibly agitated: his voice often has a <br/>\ngrumpy, growly tone, even when saying *yes* to something.  After <br/>\na few days, it&#39;s become hard to ignore the tone and listen to the <br/>\nmessage underneath, especially when his friends and their <br/>\nparents focus on the tone and ignore the message.  Hannah, 9, <br/>\nhas also become needier than I expected, with unbeforeseen <br/>\nlevels of whining and clinginess.  <br/>\nhmmmm, has *MY* voice been on edge and crabby? does *MY* <br/>\ninner child want to whine and cling?  Am I seeing the fruit of my <br/>\nown struggle blossom in my children?  YOU BETCHA!! <br/>\nI see that &quot;taking my time&quot; with the move has not been the <br/>\nbenefit I anticipated, a quick clean break would have left me with <br/>\nless ruminating time and more time to deal with what&#39;s at hand <br/>\nnow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I wandered about on Sandra&#39;s website, I found a great story <br/>\nabout a family interaction where she has an &#39;aha!&#39; moment -- <br/>\nrealizing she is more &quot;my children&#39;s mother than my mother&#39;s <br/>\nchild&quot;  This really resonated with me as I, too, realize how easy it <br/>\nis to give in to the really loud voices in my head (revert to <br/>\nstandard/authoritarian parenting) even though they aren&#39;t the <br/>\nones that make the most sense (they&#39;re just the loudest and <br/>\nmost practiced of the voices &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo today, I will be their mom, the product of what I&#39;ve learned <br/>\nsince they&#39;ve come along, not the product of my parents.  I will <br/>\nbreathe, smile and cuddle; find every opportunity to say yes; and I <br/>\nwill get our things organized and moved so to make the rest of <br/>\nthe transition easier.  <br/>\n<br/>\n:) diana</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108465,"nextTopicId":108512}}
