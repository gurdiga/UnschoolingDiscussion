I don&#39;t remember all of <br/>\nthe specifics now, but I remember deciding to NOT go that route for <br/>\nseveral reasons.  One was the religious aspect.  We&#39;re not religious <br/>\nat all...in fact, I&#39;m atheist (try being in a Christian homeSCHOOL <br/>\ngroup as an atheist UNschooler...egads!).  Most of the umbrella <br/>\nschools are religion-based and I was NOT willing to sign a statement <br/>\nof faith.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe second reason, IIRC, was curriculum requirements.  At the time, <br/>\nit seemed like we would more hoops to deal with that way vs. <br/>\nworrying about the state testing that was, at that time, 5 yrs in <br/>\nthe future.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird was cost.  It costs nothing to register with the school board.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for ways to avoid the test...as I stated in the original post, <br/>\nyes, we could avoid it in several ways.

Of course, we <br/>\nview &quot;instruction&quot; as anything and everything...living life, and we <br/>\ndo it every day :), so we send in the forms each year and that&#39;s it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, this would be my oldest son&#39;s 5th grade year in school.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s &quot;required&quot; to take a state test.  I would prefer he didn&#39;t <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s useless and potentially worse than useless (harmful).  <br/>\nMy husband is a &quot;lawful good&quot; person (Sandra, you&#39;re familiar with <br/>\nrole playing...D&D miniatures, modules, maps and adventures are <br/>\nconstantly in play here) and as such, doesn&#39;t want us to actively <br/>\ntry to avoid the test (such as my listing him as a 4th grader this <br/>\nyear, or advancing him to 6th).  He feels that we should follow the <br/>\nrules.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, I&#39;ve called the school board several times to try to <br/>\ndetermine what the penalty is for NOT taking the test.  No one seems <br/>\nto know.  The &quot;rules&quot; state that the test has to be done...nothing <br/>\nis said about what will occur if it isn&#39;t.  I&#39;ve also tried to <br/>\ndetermine exactly what the test is called so that IF we do this, I <br/>\ncan at least obtain some practice tests so that my son will know <br/>\nwhat to expect.  Again, no one seems to be able to provide that <br/>\ninformation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also told my husband that IF the school board doesn&#39;t contact <br/>\nus, I will not contact them.  He&#39;s a bit uncomfortable with that but <br/>\nI simply said &quot;Oh, so because they&#39;re inept, I&#39;m now supposed to do <br/>\nTHEIR job FOR them with something that I don&#39;t believe in doing <br/>\nanyway?&quot;  He let that one go. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried to adopt the attitude that DS will take the test with the <br/>\nexplanation that it&#39;s &quot;no big deal.&quot;  But I&#39;m afraid that if he <br/>\ntakes it, and doesn&#39;t do well, this will be fuel for more <br/>\nnegativity toward unschooling.  Both grandparents, my husband, and I <br/>\nhave advanced degrees in education...so we&#39;re really stepping <br/>\noutside the &quot;norm&quot; for our family in unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS is a terrific reader (he regularly DMs and has no trouble reading <br/>\na player&#39;s handbook), has an amazing wealth of knowledge and <br/>\nabilities, yet little of it fits into the school &quot;box.&quot;  I hate to <br/>\nthink that a standardized test could be used to &quot;judge&quot; him in any <br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts? Advice? Suggestions? <br/>\n<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111074,"nextTopicId":111033}}
