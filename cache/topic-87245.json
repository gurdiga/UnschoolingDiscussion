I can see this is going to get questioned more and more <br/>\nthough.  My son is 7 going on 8 this May and cannot read so now he <br/>\nwill be compared to other kids in our family that are in school. I <br/>\nusally ignore them just like I think my son does but I was wondering <br/>\nif any one had any words of wisdom ???<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSonya<br/>\nAttleboro, Massachusetts</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87254,"nextTopicId":87279}}
