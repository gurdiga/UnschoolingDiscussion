If you are<br/>\ngoing to paint a house, it doesn&#39;t matter your educational background, you<br/>\nneed to find out how much paint to buy.  The difference in the educational<br/>\nbackground is likely to show in the school child thinking there is &quot;a&quot; way<br/>\nto figure the area and the unschooler being able to figure it several ways.<br/>\nWhen my kids and I talk about arithmetic concepts we talk about the formulas<br/>\nas simply shortcuts somebody figured out.  They aren&#39;t magical unto<br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n2yos learn to talk because they want to communicate effectively.  Kids learn<br/>\nto spell because they want to communicate effectively.  Gee whiz, I have a<br/>\ngraduate degree and still use spell check because I tend to overuse doubling<br/>\nof letters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis core of knowledge the woman talks about that all Americans need.  Has<br/>\nshe ever gone from one school district to another?  One state to another?<br/>\nThe kids learn different things.  When my kids don&#39;t get a reference in a<br/>\nconversation or television show, they ask about it.  Shoot, I married a<br/>\nyankee and his family doesn&#39;t use the colorful language and &quot;sayings&quot; my<br/>\nfamily does.  Had to sit and explain them to him.  No big deal.  He also has<br/>\na graduate degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26021,"nextTopicId":26001}}
