That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>\ngrowing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>\nmagic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>\nme....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                                    ----Frances Hodgson Burnett</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60781,"nextTopicId":60570}}
