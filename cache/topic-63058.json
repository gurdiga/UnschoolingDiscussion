It seemed like someone was trying<br/>\nto fit me into a mold that&#39;s just not my size.  I didn&#39;t ask for advice,<br/>\nbut got it in spades.<br/>\n*This list just tells it the way it is. Sometimes that&#39;s the way we need to <br/>\nbe spoken to so that we can OPEN OUR EYES! I came to this list to with an <br/>\nattitude just like yours but now I thank this list for all the help they have <br/>\ngiven me. The molding doesn&#39;t hurt, I promise.<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I stated the truth in the beginning - we will be doing a cross between<br/>\nhomeschooling and unschooling.  I don&#39;t believe in the complete<br/>\nstructure that seems to go hand in hand with homeschooling, but complete<br/>\nunschooling would not fit my family&#39;s situation either.  We&#39;ll be in a<br/>\ngray area.  If that offends anyone, you are entitled to your feeling and<br/>\nopinions just the same as anyone is. <br/>\n*You are not unschooling if you are still homeschooling. This list is for <br/>\nunschooling so you can&#39;t get mad if people disagree with what you want to do. <br/>\nCheck out other lists that cater more to your style or read, read and read <br/>\nfrom this list and you will learn. <br/>\n&lt;&lt;It seems like most on the list that have spoken up so far disagree with<br/>\nalmost everything I&#39;ve tried to say.  Fine, disagree all you want to.<br/>\nI&#39;m not looking for approval or disapproval, but do whatever makes you<br/>\nfeel better - neither will help me or my child so I&#39;m not giving it any<br/>\nattention.<br/>\n*I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s advice to you is making them feel better!  <br/>\n&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t plan on leaving the list, but I definitely won&#39;t be very vocal -<br/>\nwhy encourage the criticism?<br/>\n*Why belong to a list that you don&#39;t like and will not be vocal in?<br/>\n&lt;&lt;None of this is being posted to encourage a reply.  Personally I&#39;d<br/>\nrather see this topic die out.  What I thought was a simple introduction<br/>\nhas gone awry.  If anyone feels moved to respond all I can ask for is to<br/>\nplease do it privately - there have *got* to be better things to talk<br/>\nabout...<br/>\n*Yes, there are better things to talk about....What you came here for.... <br/>\nUnschooling <br/>\n<br/>\n~Newbie Kim~<br/>\nThankful for this list<br/>\nPlease do not respond to me privately</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62869,"nextTopicId":62989}}
