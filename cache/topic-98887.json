He has no interest in<br/>\nparticipating in any type of class, sport team, instruction, etc, unless I<br/>\nam right by his side. We have tried a couple trial classes (in things that<br/>\nhe seems to truly enjoy such as tae kwon do and gymanstics), and he<br/>\ntypically lays on the floor and cries. He will not &quot;line up&quot; or do what the<br/>\nother kids are doing or follow the instructor.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s just too soon for him to feel safe without you nearby. You are<br/>\ndoing the right thing by honoring his needs and fears. <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn started a loving, gentle modern dance class when she was 3. For the<br/>\nfirst year I pretty much had to sit in view of her at the top of the stairs.<br/>\nI tried to honor the teacher&#39;s idea that there be no audience - to encourage<br/>\nfree expression - by reading a book with my back to the class, but I was<br/>\nstill there for Jayn to run over and get a kissy at will. This year we have<br/>\nprogressed to me being downstairs in the living room, again contrary to the<br/>\nteacher&#39;s preference for her home not to be a waiting room - but she sees<br/>\nthat Jayn needs to know I am accessible to her so that she will dance<br/>\nhappily. This teacher really is a treasure, and the kids just adore her.<br/>\nFinding the right teacher is one part of the equation. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that Jayn was very sensitive to was large, echo filled indoor<br/>\nspaces with crowds of noisy people, especially if she was &quot;required&quot; to be<br/>\nsitting (egs: cinemas, theaters, halls, churches) - she would become very<br/>\nscared and clingy, and would cry to leave. She seems to have gotten over<br/>\nthat to a great degree - I believe in part because I never pushed her to<br/>\nstay in any of these types of places when she was nervous. I always left<br/>\nimmediately with her. Perhaps your son has some of the same reactions to the<br/>\nsound of crowds.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My family tells me it is &quot;unhealthy&quot; for him to be with me (or Dad) all<br/>\nthe time and he needs to be able to interact with others and follow<br/>\ninstruction from others.  I do not agree with this, but on some level it<br/>\ndoes eat away at me deep inside. I was in every class imaginable as a child<br/>\nand I think it is hard for me to understand how he could not want to<br/>\nparticipate in these types of things. But I have realized that I need to<br/>\naccept his personality and find ways to work WITH it, not against it.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yes. The little drips of poison that our other family members sometimes<br/>\nmanage to insert into our thinking at times. Flush them out if you can. Here<br/>\nyou are surrounded metaphorically by people who totally reject that notion<br/>\nof it being &quot;unhealthy&quot; to meet your little child&#39;s needs for parental<br/>\ncontact. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Following Instructions&quot; is a schoolthink criterion of success. In a few<br/>\nyears your boy will be playing PS2 games with the best of them, and<br/>\nfollowing all the instructions he needs to in order to advance up the<br/>\nlevels, or solve the puzzle or whatever game type excites him. Consider that<br/>\nhe is learning to trust his own judgment and to be discerning in his choice<br/>\nof leaders and mentors - an ability that may save his life one day.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother does the &quot;poison zinger&quot; sometimes - she doesn&#39;t see it as a<br/>\nnegative action. She believes she is trying to help, but lives by a whole<br/>\ndifferent paradigm of parenting and love relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat works with my mother is to find some article, usually on the internet,<br/>\nwritten by a source that she respects, and send it to her. My mother<br/>\nrespects authority, especially medical doctors. Therefore for her I will<br/>\nsend information from the American Academy of Pediatrics website, rather<br/>\nthan say, Mothering Magazine. Many times the information is essentially the<br/>\nsame. Perhaps you can find a source that your relatives will respect for<br/>\nsome Attachment Parenting information, and that will quiet them down on this<br/>\npushing independence issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nFurther to your own spiritual growth as a parent, you might re-examine<br/>\nwhether you truly wanted to be in all the classes you were in as a child,<br/>\nand what function they served for you.  Maybe you were looking for approval<br/>\nor validation. In my case, being somewhere other than with my mother was my<br/>\ngoal in many of the extra classes and after-school clubs I did when young.<br/>\nDid you really have a choice about the extra classes? Maybe you really did<br/>\nwant to be there and thrived on them - were you not quite 6 years old at<br/>\nthat time, or are you recalling your feelings at a later age? Are you having<br/>\nregrets that your son seems temperamentally very different from you or from<br/>\nyour expectations? Sometimes having an expectation is the surest way to a<br/>\ndisappointment. I&#39;m NOT looking for a report here, unless you have some<br/>\nepiphany you want to share, just suggesting some ideas to help you find more<br/>\nempathy for your son&#39;s emotional reactions to the places you have tried. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So my question is - does anyone have any advice on how to work with this<br/>\n<br/>\npersonality style?  I can see clearly what he is interested in, but quite <br/>\noften I just don&#39;t know how to further his learning without looking for <br/>\n&quot;outside&quot; help (class, etc.)  For example, he is extremely interested in <br/>\nmedieval living, especially the fighting. (And I have read with great <br/>\ninterest the recent thread on SCA.) I suggested a fencing class or getting <br/>\ninvolved in a Ren Faire. He tells me very bluntly that he will only do it <br/>\nif I do it with him.  OK, but it&#39;s not that easy to find this type of <br/>\nscenario. Most will expect the children to participate with other children <br/>\n- not adults.  Am I just looking in the wrong places?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have done fencing as part of an acting class, and I really enjoyed it -<br/>\nbut I was an adult. The teacher was formerly the coach of the Australian<br/>\nOlympic fencing team. It was very physically demanding, very intense and<br/>\nthere are mesh masks and padding to be worn that *could* be intimidating or<br/>\nclaustrophobic for a little fellow. For beginners it can be very formalized.<br/>\nI think first watch some classes from a safe distance, to discover if he<br/>\nwants to pursue this. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy first thoughts when I read he is interested in medieval living are:<br/>\nmovies, the History Channel, computer games, the internet, local museums and<br/>\npicture books. So immediately assuming a class or group activity is the<br/>\nFIRST option does suggest to me that yes you are looking in the wrong places<br/>\n- and making more work for yourself. With Jayn, I usually start slowly when<br/>\nshe starts expressing some interest. Rather than &quot;getting involved&quot; with a<br/>\nRen. Faire, what about just attending one in your area. I would suggest to<br/>\nyou that you release this emphasis on &quot;working&quot; with his personality (you<br/>\nuse that word more than once), and just enjoy yourselves as much as possible<br/>\ndoing anything you both find fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I know that he will not be &quot;hanging on my leg&quot; when he is 16 years old.<br/>\nI cherish the fact that he wants to be with me now. But the part of me that <br/>\nis &quot;schooled&quot; is concerned that he may be missing his chance for many <br/>\nthings. For example, the typical schooled child will begin on a T-ball or <br/>\nlittle league team (my son also loves baseball, when played by *his* rules <br/>\nwith Mom & Dad) at, what, age 5 or 6? So if my son is not comfortable <br/>\nparticipating on a team until he&#39;s 10 - how will we find a &quot;place&quot; for him <br/>\nsince he has not started on the same level?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son may never want to participate in a team sport. It is not a<br/>\nmandatory rite of passage. Really. If he is enjoying the physical games with<br/>\nyou and dh, then that is great. He will come to want other friends too. He<br/>\nreally will.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are &quot;play for fun&quot; groups for different sports, and homeschool teams<br/>\nall over the place with different levels of commitment asked that start at<br/>\nall kinds of ages. Some, but not all, are serious competitive teams moving<br/>\nin the same leagues as school teams. Someone at a local University in my<br/>\narea has a semi-organized soccer playing session once a week for little<br/>\nkids, with the emphasis on enjoyment well attended by members of my<br/>\nhomeschool group. Jayn sometimes expresses an interest, but not enough to<br/>\novercome the unfortunate scheduling of the event at 10AM.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for missing his chance, it is true that there are some things that *seem*<br/>\nto require a very young start to reach the absolute pinnacle of it. Olympic<br/>\ngymnastics for girls and being a prima ballerina come to mind at once. There<br/>\nseems, and maybe I&#39;m wrong, to be a lot more age leeway for boys in the same<br/>\nsports - possibly because many of the sports for boys place more emphasis on<br/>\nstrength and less on suppleness, and boys just keep getting bigger and<br/>\nstronger as they age and do their sport. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever watching the Olympics, and some of the historical sports shows<br/>\naround them, I notice there are plenty of stories of successful athletes who<br/>\n&quot;beat the odds&quot; starting in their sport in their early teens, or after some<br/>\ninjury or illness pushed them out of some other sport. And this is at the<br/>\ntop levels of these sports, a long way from neighborhood leagues or the<br/>\noffice team getting together to noodle around with a basketball for fun on<br/>\nthe weekend. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would guess that enthusiasm and willingness to practice probably go a long<br/>\nway with most coaches. Other people will have more experience than I do. I<br/>\nwonder how many of these little schooled boys would rather be playing a<br/>\nloving, happy game using their own rules with Mom and Dad, instead of the<br/>\nhigh pressure of Little League.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I certainly don&#39;t want to make <br/>\nthem feel bad about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has the exact same personality.  He&#39;s most happy at home, <br/>\nand doesn&#39;t even like going shopping.  But it&#39;s easy to accept him--<br/>\nif I want to go somewhere and he doesn&#39;t, I just go without him.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not so easy with little boys who cry, &quot;But I don&#39;t want you to <br/>\nleave me&quot; at the mention of me going somewhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor our family too, I think that the &quot;not going anywhere&quot; has maybe <br/>\nbeen part of the deschooling process.  I used to do school at home <br/>\nwith Alisha, and although we didn&#39;t do lots of textbook/workbook <br/>\nstuff, I controlled what we did VERY much.  Lots of hands-on, trip <br/>\ntype stuff that she *had* to do because of unit studies I had <br/>\ndesigned.  And even though Matt was little, he got drug to a lot of <br/>\nthat stuff.  The feeling of &quot;we have to go on another educational <br/>\ntrip&quot; was in the air all too often in those days. :(  So now, freedom <br/>\nto my daughter means being free to stay home.  Classes just don&#39;t <br/>\nseem appealing to her--and she&#39;s been free for several years now.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; And keep repeating the quote about education not being &quot;filling a <br/>\n&gt; pail&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, but I&#39;d say it&#39;s not the lighting of a fire either.

He has no interest in <br/>\nparticipating<br/>\nin any type of class, sport team, instruction, etc, unless I am right <br/>\nby<br/>\nhis side.  We have tried a couple trial classes (in things that he <br/>\nseems to<br/>\ntruly enjoy such as tae kwon do and gymanstics), and he typically <br/>\nlays on<br/>\nthe floor and cries. He will not &quot;line up&quot; or do what the other kids <br/>\nare<br/>\ndoing or follow the instructor.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys are like that too.  At 5 my oldest boy did swimming lessons <br/>\n(his older sister was doing them, so I asked if he wanted to try a <br/>\nclass too).  He wouldn&#39;t go in the water without me, which was <br/>\naccepted by the swimming class at that age.  But even with me, he <br/>\nrefused to participate with the rest of the class (especially when it <br/>\ninvolved the instructor trying to get him to go with her!)  So Matt <br/>\nand I went off to our own little section of the pool each day and <br/>\nplayed around in the water by ourselves.  At 6 he signed up for <br/>\nsoccer (his idea) because he thought it looked fun.  Then we got <br/>\nthere and he realized that I wouldn&#39;t be playing &quot;with&quot; him.  It <br/>\nwasn&#39;t a mom and son soccer team and he wouldn&#39;t do it.  He wouldn&#39;t <br/>\neven go out on the field for practices unless I did it with him.  He <br/>\nquit soccer.  Then at 7 he became interested in karate.  I called <br/>\naround to all the martial arts schools within a reasonable distance <br/>\nto see if they offer any type of family class where parents/siblings <br/>\ncan take together but the closest I could find was a school that said <br/>\nparents can be right there watching.  We went to a trial lesson.  He <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t go out on the floor and wasn&#39;t interested in going back <br/>\nthere again because he didn&#39;t like that they kept encouraging him to <br/>\ngo out on the floor and try it out.  He hasn&#39;t tried anything else in <br/>\nthe way of organized classes and activities, but even at park dates <br/>\nwith other homeschoolers, we&#39;re not often the family with the mom <br/>\nsitting talking to other parents watching the kids play.

She IS very discriminating as far as what <br/>\nactivities she chooses to participate in but when she really wants to <br/>\ndo something, she&#39;s okay leaving me.

So we found things we could do together:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaytime with friends<br/>\nChildren&#39;s theater performances<br/>\nVisits to the zoo, science center, children&#39;s museums<br/>\nFamily swims at the local pool<br/>\nFamily whale watching trips<br/>\nBuilding model rockets and setting up an annual &quot;rocket day&quot; event<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until my son was seven that he was interested in a gymnastics<br/>\nclass, but only after watching two friends in this class for about a<br/>\nyear.  He started with a once a week class and then added another when<br/>\nhe was ready.  Quite a while later we joined a family unicycling club.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe loved playing baseball at the park, but didn&#39;t want to play on a<br/>\nteam until he was nine years old.  Then he was ready, and he loved it.<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t take very long to learn the basic team skills because he was<br/>\nreally interested and serious about playing ball.   The coach really<br/>\nliked his hard work and good attitude.  Many of the other kids seemed<br/>\nbored and not very motivated to learn to play the game well.  I think it<br/>\nwas just one more activity among many for them to attend.

It&#39;s hard for me to imagine kids of this age running out wanting to do things away from parents (though I&#39;m sure some do).  I just think it is so completely normal for kids that are 5-6-7 yrs old to be hesitant to do classes, group activites, ect. without mom (or even with sometimes). Especially the oldest child.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy 7 yo just started dance last year, and really loves it. She waited until she felt comfortable going &quot;to a class&quot; (as she says) even though she talked about &quot;dance class&quot; since she was 4 or 5. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy 5 (almost 5.5) yr old son says he wants to try soccer this fall. He&#39;s not a group kid at all, and is not sure about all of the rules. I assured him if he wasn&#39;t comfortable, for whatever reason, then he doesn&#39;t have to go. We&#39;ll see what he thinks of it, but honestly I&#39;m surprised he&#39;s wanting to do it. I think seeing his sister go to &quot;classes&quot; is pushing him along a bit sooner.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, anyway, it all sounds very normal to me...for whatever that&#39;s worth ;)<br/>\nKristina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59461774,"authorName":"Sarah","from":"Sarah &lt;sarahanne1@...&gt;","profile":"sarahanne1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Intro & ? on &quot;being with Mom all the time&quot;","postDate":"1093558525","msgId":98897,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwODI2MjIxNTI1LjIxNDEzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMzAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUuMi4xLjEuMi4yMDA0MDgyNjA4NDczNS4wMzBiYTY3OEBwb3Auc2hhbm5vbmVudGluLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":98895,"nextInTopic":98899,"prevInTime":98896,"nextInTime":98898,"topicId":98887,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You ve already gotten a lot of great advice, but I couldn t resist!

It&#39;s hard sometimes to find<br/>\nlike-minded  people, but I&#39;d encourage you to keep searching through<br/>\nattending homeschool events (or setting up your own, like a game of wiffle<br/>\nball at the park)  until you find a family or two that both you and your son<br/>\nhit it off with.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHaving that support is very valuable to me.  I actively searched for a<br/>\nfriend who would understand unschooling.  It&#39;s not my nature to seek people<br/>\nout, generally, but I felt we had a need and so I kept my antennae up,<br/>\nlooking for someone that might fit the bill.  My girls were invited to a<br/>\nbirthday party a year and a half ago and I  chatted with another mom whose<br/>\ndd was also at the party and had a dd the same age as my oldest. Our lives<br/>\nhad a lot of parallels and I just had a feeling that we could all be good<br/>\nfriends.  It isn&#39;t my tendency to call up people I&#39;ve just met and ask them<br/>\nto visit, but after the party I got her email address from the lady who<br/>\nhosted the party and emailed and asked her if she wanted to get together for<br/>\na play date.

My name is Carmen and I live in <br/>\nAustin, Texas, with my husband Michael, and our three daughters, <br/>\nages 5, 2.5, and 15 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter, Eva, is very cautious and does not like to <br/>\nparticipate in large groups of anything.  Sometimes, even meeting <br/>\nONE new person can overwhelm her and send her into my lap (as <br/>\nhappened last week when we tried to meet with a piano teacher).  We <br/>\ntried dance class...lasted a month, with me in the room the whole <br/>\ntime so that she could check in with me whenever she needed to.  We <br/>\ndid do a year of pre-school for three hours four times a week.  She <br/>\nhid behind me at the door or would go slowly toward an acitivity <br/>\narea, avoiding eye contact with any of the teachers or kids.  She <br/>\nenjoys people, just on HER terms, which usually means small groups <br/>\nand knowing where I am at all times.  She went to vacation bible <br/>\nschool for the firt time this past June, but her grandmother (who <br/>\nshe&#39;s very close to) was with her the whole time and it was at a <br/>\nchurch that she has gone to since she was two (but this is the first <br/>\nyear she would try vbs).<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be really bothered by all of this and wondered if I needed <br/>\nto &quot;toughen&quot; her up.  But I realized that this was because I had <br/>\nbeen forced to develop a false bravado as a child as a defense <br/>\nmechanism.  My parents divorced when I was two and I was shuffled <br/>\nbetween relatives/friends/daycare as my mom had to work.  She <br/>\nremarried when I was six and looking back, I realized that I was <br/>\nreally miserable but tried my darndest to hide it.  I acted out a <br/>\nlot and became very sarcastic and snotty and tried to pretend <br/>\nnothing bothered me(STILL working on that!). <br/>\n<br/>\nI think Betsy is very right when she talks about that old-school <br/>\nmentality of forcing kids into situations to &quot;toughen them up&quot;.  I <br/>\nremember telling another pre-school mom that if Eva didn&#39;t want to <br/>\ngo to pre-school, she didn&#39;t have to...and the mom was just <br/>\nflabbergasted.  &quot;How will she EVER learn that she HAS to do things, <br/>\nespecially those things she doesn&#39;t want to?&quot; she gasped.  How, <br/>\nindeed?!  What if she learned instead that she could stay at home <br/>\nand play with mom and her two younger sisters and be happy and safe <br/>\nand that her mom and dad would never force her into a room full of <br/>\nstrangers and then walk away, telling her all the while that &quot;it&#39;ll <br/>\nbe okay, honey&quot;?  Yes, it might turn out to be fun, IF she stopped <br/>\ncrying or hiding in the corner.  What about the damage I had done to <br/>\nher trust of us?  How much better if EVA chose to go into that room <br/>\nof her own accord?  And if that never happens, so be it.  Life is <br/>\nfull of other things, other riches, that aren&#39;t exclusive to a dance <br/>\nclass, an art class, an acting class...all of those things that I&#39;ve <br/>\ntried and that we now, SHOCK, do at home!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s been the biggest challenge for me in my unschooling <br/>\njourney...learning to let go of expectations and just following my <br/>\ndaughters&#39; lead.  I know in the long run that each of my daughters <br/>\nwill have a true sense of themselves since they were never forced to <br/>\nbe someone they were not, or never allowed to be who they truly <br/>\nwere.  And I, in the process, am getting to know myself all over <br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to all of you for sharing your experiences, doubts, fears, <br/>\nvictories, and advice.

Ben is 5.5 and really only wants to do things if I am with him, or his dad.  He&#39;ll go to a friend&#39;s house to play without me, for a few hours and he has a teenage sitter that he really likes, so he is able to be without us, but he prefers to be with me or his dad.  Which works out well because we prefer it when he&#39;s with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom and dad are so overly concerned that he is not with other people.  &quot;he really needs to be away from you some of the time, this is not normal or healthy for him to be so dependent on you.&quot;  Blah, blah blah.  It makes them crazy that they have friends whose grandkids come and stay most of the summer when they are only 4-5, and he won&#39;t even stay overnight.  My dad is a huge grouch and a ball of stress, that probably has more to do with it than anything with them.  He doesn&#39;t like to be there without me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also won&#39;t take any classes unless I stay.  We have great science classes at museums and zoos, when I suggested one that he could go alone for an hour and a half, he said no way!  So, I go with him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as it lasting forever, one of my fellow LLL leaders told me this when I asked her about it.  Her son never left her side, was homeschooled, co-sleeping, extended nursing, basically similar to us.  She thought he&#39;d never become dependent.  At the time I asked her about it, he was traveling through Europe alone, and she hadn&#39;t talked with him in 2 weeks because he has no cell phone with him, and very little money.  He is 23.  <br/>\nSo it does happen eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ds hasn&#39;t really showed an interest in sports, he&#39;s small for his age and not very athletic (if there is such a thing at 5).  I guess I&#39;m just going to let him go at his own pace for things.  I don&#39;t have any advice or help, but just wanted to let you know, you are not alone.  <br/>\nLaura J<br/>\nTampa<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Intro & ? on &quot;being with Mom all the time&quot;","postDate":"1093544336","msgId":98888,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxMkUyOTkwLjIwNzAyMDNAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDUuMi4xLjEuMi4yMDA0MDgyNjA4NDczNS4wMzBiYTY3OEBwb3Auc2hhbm5vbmVudGluLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDUuMi4xLjEuMi4yMDA0MDgyNjA4NDczNS4wMzBiYTY3OEBwb3Auc2hhbm5vbmVudGluLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":98887,"nextInTopic":98890,"prevInTime":98887,"nextInTime":98889,"topicId":98887,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** We do not receive any support from our extended family in our unschooling decision.

So, it appears that fear of criticism is an issue that <br/>\neven mouthy and outspoken people like me can have a problem with.  You <br/>\nare not alone.   (I stopped hiding after the first year.  I stress to <br/>\nthe grandparents the advantages of having a kid who is free to spend a <br/>\nday with relatives any time they are in town.  And I&#39;ll shamelessly tell <br/>\nthem that I think having time to be with extended family is more <br/>\nvaluable than being in school.  One can learn a lot about history, <br/>\nculture, and any other special interests from family members.)<br/>\n<br/>\n** My son is quite attached to Mom & Dad. He has no interest in <br/>\nparticipating<br/>\nin any type of class, sport team, instruction, etc, unless I am right by<br/>\nhis side. We have tried a couple trial classes (in things that he seems to<br/>\ntruly enjoy such as tae kwon do and gymanstics), and he typically lays on<br/>\nthe floor and cries.**<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a big variation in how much kids like group activites.  I did <br/>\nsome Kindermusik when my son was three, and even though the mom or dad <br/>\nis there sitting on the floor doing the musical activities with the kid <br/>\nand dancing around in circles with them, there were some kids that <br/>\ndeclined to participate most of the time.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good to <br/>\nforce it.  I won&#39;t insist that my son do an activity that he is opposed to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an only child, and sometimes I borrow a more enthusiastic child <br/>\nwhen we are going some place with activities.  (I volunteered my husband <br/>\nto supervise an extra kid at the Sacramento conference so the boys could <br/>\nplay on the game deck and go do the climbing wall together.)<br/>\n<br/>\n** My family tells me it is &quot;unhealthy&quot; for him to be with me (or Dad) <br/>\nall the<br/>\ntime...**<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe that this is true.  I think it&#39;s a leftover from <br/>\nold-fashioned, Germanic parenting that was reinforced by Freud.  The <br/>\nunderlying belief is that a boy who spends a lot of time being close to <br/>\nhis mom will be a &quot;girlie-man&quot; (as Ahnold calls it) and won&#39;t be hard <br/>\nand cold enough to be a valuable member of the Prussian army.  Let&#39;s <br/>\nthink about goals here! &lt;g&gt;  We&#39;re not trying to raise relentless <br/>\nkilling machines &lt;g&gt;, so let&#39;s throw out the tactics that were developed <br/>\nfor that.<br/>\n<br/>\n** I do not agree with this, but on some level it does eat away<br/>\nat me deep inside.**<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I&#39;m always more comfortable when other people agree with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n**I was in every class imaginable as a child and I think<br/>\nit is hard for me to understand how he could not want to participate in<br/>\nthese types of things. But I have realized that I need to accept his<br/>\npersonality and find ways to work WITH it, not against it.**<br/>\n<br/>\nRight.  People are different.  My mom was really extroverted and really <br/>\nneeded to get out of the house, and as a kid I ended up feeling that I <br/>\nwas inferior because I wasn&#39;t as &quot;brave&quot; and good with people as she <br/>\nwas.  (Yes, she got impatient with my shyness a lot.)  (I&#39;m not saying <br/>\nyou are the same, it&#39;s just the first thing that springs into my mind <br/>\nwhen I try to visualize a kid that doesn&#39;t want to be in class.)<br/>\n<br/>\n** So my question is - does anyone have any advice on how to work with this<br/>\npersonality style? **<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you go to a local unschooling or homeschooling park day?  (That&#39;s my <br/>\nknee jerk &quot;solution&quot; to every social problem.)  It might be great to <br/>\nfind another kid that has a really similar temperament and then do stuff <br/>\nwith him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd keep repeating the quote about education not being &quot;filling a <br/>\npail&quot;.  Teaching doesn&#39;t always cause good learning.  The teaching can <br/>\nbe confusing, or too slow, etc.  Kids who just mess around with stuff <br/>\ncan often learn more that way than through a class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you will be going through a process where you change from thinking:<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;how can we learn more about this; I know there must be a class <br/>\nsomewhere?&quot; <br/>\nto<br/>\n&quot;how can we learn about this without taking a class?&quot;<br/>\nto<br/>\n&quot;how can we have fun with this?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not at all surprising that classes might be your first idea if you <br/>\nyourself loved taking classes.  (My first idea is to always find a book <br/>\nabout something, and that&#39;s not what works with my kid.)  You&#39;re <br/>\nbranching out from your normal pattern of thinking to include wider and <br/>\nwider possibilities.  It&#39;ll take practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish more classes let kids watch first.  If all the local parks and <br/>\nrec classes had video clips on their website, there&#39;s a chance that I <br/>\ncould get my kid to take more classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n**So if my son is not comfortable<br/>\nparticipating on a team until he&#39;s 10 - how will we find a &quot;place&quot; for him<br/>\nsince he has not started on the same level?**<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know.

He tells me very bluntly that he will only do it <br/>\nif I do it with him.  OK, but it&#39;s not that easy to find this type of <br/>\nscenario. Most will expect the children to participate with other children <br/>\n- not adults.  Am I just looking in the wrong places?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that he will not be &quot;hanging on my leg&quot; when he is 16 years old. I <br/>\ncherish the fact that he wants to be with me now. But the part of me that <br/>\nis &quot;schooled&quot; is concerned that he may be missing his chance for many <br/>\nthings.
