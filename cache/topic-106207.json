Overeating means eating past the <br/>\npoint of feeling full. I&#39;d observe them without comment. Just watch. Are <br/>\nthey really eating to excess? Don&#39;t fret about it. No comments. Just <br/>\nobserve. And make sure their days have other interesting things in them. <br/>\nSandbox play, walking the dogs, coloring, park time. Children&#39;s museum? You <br/>\nknow, provide lots of variety of activities, so they aren&#39;t always hanging <br/>\nout in the house. That&#39;s MY big downfall in the eating arena. Hang out at <br/>\nhome, get bored, open the fridge. bleh. Not good.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur two mid-kids eat when and what they want, mostly. We like having a <br/>\nfamily Dinner At the Table once in awhile, and I&#39;ll ask them on those days <br/>\nnot to snack after such and such a time, because we&#39;re having a sit down <br/>\ndinner. Also, they know if they eat it all, and the food budget is <br/>\nstretched, they&#39;ll have to wait for their favorites until the next paycheck. <br/>\nThey&#39;re bigger, though. 12 and 10. Capable of consuming a gallon of milk in <br/>\nan afternoon. ;) Maybe if they&#39;d always had this food freedom, they&#39;d be <br/>\nless likely to munch it all down, as mid-kids. who knows?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh.

I<br/>\n&gt;have two girls, ages four and two, and have been reading about<br/>\n&gt;unschooling for about three years now. A couple of you may know me<br/>\n&gt;from one of the Christian lists.<br/>\n&gt;Anyway! I&#39;m wondering if, in my quest for them making choices, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;being too passive. The concerns I have are mostly with my four year<br/>\n&gt;old, although my two year does similar things to a lesser extent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;She/they seem to want to eat all day long! For the four year old,<br/>\n&gt;breakfast might be two bowls of oatmeal, or maybe something like<br/>\n&gt;rice chex, and/or a couple eggs. They both often help themselves<br/>\n&gt;to &quot;stick cheese&quot; sometimes several times a day. They also both like<br/>\n&gt;to have &quot;snack bowls&quot; of dry cereal throughout the day, usually<br/>\n&gt;Froot Loops or maybe Chex or Cheerios.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My oldest does not like fruit much; she might eat some once or twice<br/>\n&gt;a week. If I serve peas, corn, or potatoes at dinner, she&#39;ll usually<br/>\n&gt;have some.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I guess now that I&#39;m typing it doesn&#39;t sound too bad. My main<br/>\n&gt;concerns are that they are just eating too much or having &quot;bad<br/>\n&gt;habits.&quot; They like to eat snack bowls while they watch TV or when I<br/>\n&gt;read to them, or even during short car rides, isn&#39;t that something<br/>\n&gt;pediatricians say not to allow? They eat *several* times a day;<br/>\n&gt;maybe like eight, but I couldn&#39;t even know. It seems like all day I<br/>\n&gt;hear &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; or &quot;I want a snack&quot; or see them reaching for more<br/>\n&gt;cheese. I&#39;m just afraid that kind of Eating Continually will lead to<br/>\n&gt;overeating.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My other concern is them eating things like Froot Loops and candy.<br/>\n&gt;The obvious answer would be, Don&#39;t buy those things ... but I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;want any one food, really, to be &quot;forbidden&quot; or something &quot;we don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;keep in our house,&quot; so when they&#39;re in the store with me and ask for<br/>\n&gt;those chewy, sugary fruit snacks, or whatever, I let them get it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve talked with my four year old about things like listening to<br/>\n&gt;your tummy, when it says it&#39;s empty or filled up. We&#39;ve also talked<br/>\n&gt;about eating a variety of different foods, which I guess she does to<br/>\n&gt;some extent. I have noticed that she *will* announce, &quot;I&#39;m done&quot;<br/>\n&gt;herself and leave even things like ice cream or cake and walk away<br/>\n&gt;from them. On one hand, I&#39;m glad *she* is the one making that<br/>\n&gt;decision, instead of me telling her when she&#39;s had enough. But I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;wondering if she&#39;s eating too much before she stops.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So I can&#39;t tell, even as I&#39;m writing this, if I&#39;m &quot;worrying about<br/>\n&gt;nothing&quot; or if I need to guide her a little more in her choices, or<br/>\n&gt;something else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt;Jenny </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106191,"nextTopicId":106214}}
