Thought <br/>\nI&#39;d share them....the cupcakes would be fun for any spring party, not <br/>\njust Easter.<br/>\nMake your favorite cupcake recipe and frost with plain white frosting <br/>\nor buttercream frosting.<br/>\nTake some candy eggs (small variety) like Cadbury&#39;s or M&M&#39;s and put <br/>\n2-3 in the middle. Some of the cupcakes you can top with those <br/>\nMarshmallow birds (Peeps they&#39;re called).<br/>\nFor the &quot;nest&quot; around the edges, bake some shredded coconut in a 350 <br/>\ndegree oven until browned and press onto the frosting around the <br/>\nedges of the birds and eggs.<br/>\nThey&#39;re really cute!!<br/>\nHave a great day.<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33678,"nextTopicId":32667}}
