I consider many of the things I&#39;ve heard from TCS people to be <br/>\nimmoral. One example. I have spoken to TCS followers who have said: &quot;We <br/>\noffered our best theories&quot; on tooth decay to our little 2 yo Benjie and our <br/>\nlittle Benjie listened and decided never to brush his teeth. So he hasn&#39;t <br/>\nbrushed for the last 5 years and now his teeth are in very bad shape and <br/>\nreally hurting and rotting and so we have offered our best theories about the <br/>\nbenefits of a visit to the dentist but little Benjie has decided not to go to <br/>\nthe dentist so we&#39;re letting him make that decision.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is NOT hypothetical - I&#39;ve seen similar situations posted umpteen times <br/>\non the TCS list.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo, three, and four year olds are NOT capable of projecting such current <br/>\ndecisions into the future repercussions of those decisions. To let them make <br/>\nsuch decisions is immoral, imo. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I resent about TCS is that parents who are REALLY doing a great job <br/>\n- parents who have bucked the trend of trying to manipulate their kids by <br/>\nreward and punishment, parents who do NOT spank or shame or even punish their <br/>\nkids, parents who are incredibly respectful and thoughtful and considerate <br/>\nand who work WITH their kids and do NOT have an adversarial relationship with <br/>\nthem - it accuses these parents of all kinds of nasty-sounding things like <br/>\nengaging in force, induction in disguise, failure, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\nSome of what is said here may challenge you, shock you, disturb you, or seem <br/>\nharsh.
