It is a collaborative relationship, not a subordinate relationship anymore.  Nurses have real input into patient treatment decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nNurses can get into all the same fields that doctors can. Nursing crosses all lines of the corporate world too.  Nurses are also business managers, malpractice attorneys, and legal consultants. <br/>\n<br/>\nHospitals are competing for good nurses with very attractive sign on bonuses (up to $10,000) and benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rubyprincesstsg@...\">rubyprincesstsg@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, April 08, 2003 1:21 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: pre med etc<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 4/8/2003 10:48:29 AM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ejcrewe@...\">ejcrewe@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I just thought it was an interesting comment on the cult of a pre-med <br/>\n  &gt; discipline we faced growing up and children are still facing today.  Also, <br/>\n  &gt; it <br/>\n  &gt; was interesting to see how strongly cultures can push their children to <br/>\n  &gt; succeed to a standard the children might not own.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  Frankly if you talk to any practicing doctor today there is little reason to <br/>\n  encourage your child to even THINK about being a doctor.  It&#39;s a constant <br/>\n  game with insurance companies and trying to get paid, lots and LOTS of hours, <br/>\n  huge students loans, unless of course you get scholarships.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you as a parent were to examine the idea of what to &quot;encourage&quot; your child <br/>\n  to be to earn the most money and have the most prestige it wouldn&#39;t be to <br/>\n  become a doctor for sure!  <br/>\n<br/>\n  It would BE... A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE!!!!  But then of course that is <br/>\n  considering they have any talent in that area, but as for anything else, I <br/>\n  guess you would have to have some kind aptitude for whatever you do. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I have an older son who is an apprentice to a master carpenter.  He&#39;s doing <br/>\n  what he loves.  He doesn&#39;t make much money, is often cold and wet while <br/>\n  working or sunburned beyond belief but it makes him happy and isn&#39;t that all <br/>\n  that matters?  Well mostly in this world anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n  glena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
