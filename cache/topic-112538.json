I am learning so much.  As I sink into the<br/>\nunschooling way of thinking, I notice the thing that I get hung up on<br/>\ninside myself is a question of trusting my appetites (and by extension,<br/>\ntrusting my childrens&#39;).  I mean, I have spent my whole adult life<br/>\nmoderating my desire for, say, junk food, tv, spending too much on<br/>\nbooks, spending too much in general, chocolate, etc. and here in this<br/>\nunschooling life it would seem that such restraints are not encouraged.<br/>\nGo with the joy, the pleasure, the abundance of the world, etc. The idea<br/>\nof letting loose the restraints on myself is a bit scary, I notice.  On<br/>\nthe other hand, I totally trusted that my baby&#39;s every desire was RIGHT<br/>\nand should be filled as best I could-whatever the baby enjoyed was good<br/>\nfor her.  But it would seem that I believe that at some point between<br/>\nbaby and grown up, everything baby/person enjoys isn&#39;t good anymore.<br/>\nI&#39;m just examining these as-yet-not-very-clearly-thought-through beliefs<br/>\nI seem to have.  Do y&#39;all feel you trust your children&#39;s desires<br/>\nimplicitly?  Some are easy to trust, of course, but others-the ones I<br/>\nhave learned to moderate in myself like tv or sugar-are less easy to<br/>\ntrust.  However, it occurs to me as I&#39;m writing this that perhaps the<br/>\ndifference is that I am the one monitoring and moderating my own<br/>\ndesires, not someone else doing it for me. Perhaps you allow your<br/>\nchildren to learn to moderate themselves by letting them see what<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work for them (by, say, eating too much chocolate and noticing<br/>\nthe effect?).  So then, maybe the parent&#39;s role becomes, not to moderate<br/>\nthe appetites of the child, but to encourage self-awareness as the child<br/>\nexplores so she can learn what her own limits are?<br/>\nSorry I&#39;m rambling all over here, I&#39;m just working it around in myself,<br/>\ntrying it on this way and that.  I would love to read any thoughts y&#39;all<br/>\nmight have on this or pointing out where my reasoning may be going<br/>\nastray.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for so much generous sharing of your lives,<br/>\nMaya<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112138,"nextTopicId":112539}}
