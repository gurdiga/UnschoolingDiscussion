I currently live in St Louis, Missouri, where we <br/>\nunschool our two children ages 8 and 5.  We are considering a move to <br/>\nMinnesota, but I am a bit put off by their homeschooling laws.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just wondering if there are any unschoolers from Minnesota out <br/>\nthere.  I know they exist, but I would like to hear from them how they deal <br/>\nwith the regulations and testing.  One of the reasons we took the kids out <br/>\nof school in the first place was all the silly testing, and though I would <br/>\nlove to move to MN, if it means giving up my right to unschool my kids, I <br/>\nam not sure we will do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any insight into this.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandi in St Louis<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&quot;What we want to see is the child in pursuit of knowledge, not knowledge in <br/>\npursuit of the child.&quot;<br/>\n-- George Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\nPiston Ported Vespas:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.nbci.com/piston_ported/index.html\">http://members.nbci.com/piston_ported/index.html</a><br/>\nwords<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/vespass/words.html\">http://www.geocities.com/vespass/words.html</a><br/>\nST Louis Secular Homeschooler&#39;s Co-Op<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stlsecularhomeschool.org\">http://www.stlsecularhomeschool.org</a><br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"benliam@aol.com","from":"benliam@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"2Mzq92e2KlyVUyaaRFne7iVEWVsjpC-N5wjESfysOjVmpBZe8P3RzWvs18NNQyvFvi4okoRJ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] naturalchild","postDate":"979699399","msgId":15137,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc2LjZlYzQ4YWUuMjc5NjYwYzdAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15138,"prevInTime":15136,"nextInTime":15138,"topicId":15137,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/16/01 8:12:54 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
