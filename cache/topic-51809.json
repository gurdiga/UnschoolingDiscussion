I consider myself an extremely relaxed parent...not controlling<br/>\nat all. My parents think that I do not have enough discipline with my kids<br/>\nand most of my friends can not believe what I &quot;let my kids get away with&quot;. But I<br/>\ncame here and read posts about not controlling junk food that their kids eat,<br/>\nnot controlling tv their kids watch, about seeing things from the kids point of<br/>\nview and not making decisions for my kids &quot;because I am the parent&quot;. I started <br/>\ngetting ticked off, because here I was, this great relaxed parent and they were <br/>\nsaying that things that I did were &quot;controlling&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the more I thought about it, the more I realized that they were just pointing <br/>\nout the truth...limiting junk food *is* controlling what my kids eat, limiting tv <br/>\n*is* controlling what my kids watch, telling my kids that they can&#39;t have/do something <br/>\nuntil they do what I want *is* disrespectful. Does that mean that I am some <br/>\nterrible, controlling parent who never respects my children? No. There are <br/>\nlots of areas where I am great at seeing my kids point of view. They do have a lot<br/>\nof freedom (especially when compared with some of my friends). BUT what I have<br/>\nfound by listening here is that there are even more areas where I can give my kids<br/>\nfreedom and control and not have wild unmanageable kids. This is the only place that I<br/>\nhear that...mainstream parenting is full of dire warnings, my friends and even my <br/>\nfamily keep telling me that I *have* to do things a certain way. It is so refreshing<br/>\nto hear what Joyce and Sandra and Ren and others are saying. That there is another<br/>\nlevel of parenting where you can see yourself as a partner with your children rather<br/>\nthen as a gatekeeper. This one concept has improved so many of my interactions with my<br/>\nkids. I do not feel that I have to take the advice given and do it 100%. But it does<br/>\nget me thinking about options that I might not have thought about. There are still<br/>\nareas where I control my kids more then some here, but right now it is working and<br/>\nwhen it doesn&#39;t, I know I can do differently. But I am also not going to come on <br/>\nthis list and try to convince them (or anyone else) that in these areas I am right<br/>\nand they are wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can see where you can feel jumped on, you offer something that works for you and <br/>\npeople here say that it is not the best way. It is easy to translate that into<br/>\npeople saying that you are not a good parent. But that is NOT what they said.<br/>\nSince then, some things have gotten personal and heated and that is a shame.<br/>\nAnd Joyce has been doing her best to explain where the disconnects are happening,<br/>\nwith possible explanations as to why and handling things off list when needed. You can <br/>\nbelieve or not believe her when she says that no one has said that you are this <br/>\nhorrible parent. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents as a relative newbie who has gone from being ticked off to <br/>\nlearning a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":82478390,"authorName":"Denese Kolb","from":"&quot;Denese Kolb&quot; &lt;DCOLB@...&gt;","profile":"justdenese2u","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Low self esteem","postDate":"1040067287","msgId":51856,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZTkwMWMyYTUzYSQzMThjZWE0MCRlZGY3YTUxOEBjZmwucnIuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDc4LjMzMWJkMzA2LjJiMmY3NzEyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":51855,"nextInTopic":51857,"prevInTime":51855,"nextInTime":51857,"topicId":51809,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Stop, please.
