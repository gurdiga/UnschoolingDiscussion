I&#39;m not sure I understand.  It&#39;s not like the subject was dropped and I brought it back up again.  I know what is happening on THIS list just as well as you do.  I&#39;m on it, too.   I was just suggesting what I thought might be a reason for some of the confusion going on.  And btw, it was Tia, not me, who was talking about the other list.  I only said I was on it.  Sorry if you disagree with what I&#39;ve said but honestly I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s ok for Tia to keep discussing this, but not ok for me to say something, especially since I am not posting over and over about this topic.  That said, I will not post about this ever again unless you or someone else directly responds to me and asks me something.  So trust me, I really wanna let it go<br/>\n<br/>\nI have only one child - a baby - 7 months old.  So we aren&#39;t exactly unschooling in the way that other folks discuss here.  But I do hope to do this.  And I do take into consideration what folks here have to say about how to interact with kids so that I can begin to work on it now before things get yucky.  This is one of the reasons I have not posted here about unschooling.  But I plan to do so in the future.

I know I have never posted on this list, but I do post to RUL fairly often and I have been a lurker here for a while.  While I will not get into whether I agree or disagree with anyone here, including the folks you are talking about, I will say that coming back to this list every time they say something and reporting to people on it smacks of &quot;tattling.&quot;  So, in that way, their assessment is sadly closer to the truth than I would like to believe.  Not saying this is the case overall , just that what I see you doing here seems to be exacerbating the problem, much in the same way that you claim they are.  Why not just let it go?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\namy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Tia Leschke <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling-discussion@yahoogroups.com\">unschooling-discussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, July 24, 2003 2:02 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-Discussion] RUL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now Glena, Chris, and Jeva have decided that the reason they don&#39;t like this<br/>\n  list is because it feels just like school . . . junior high school . . .<br/>\n  sigh.<br/>\n  Tia<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety<br/>\n  deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;  Ben Franklin<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
