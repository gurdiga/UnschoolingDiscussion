And for them, living<br/>\nmeans playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuz and I have a friend in Chicago, Bruce Thomas,<br/>\nwho runs an organization called The Children¹s Learning Project. After<br/>\nextensive research and observation by both Bruce and others, they concluded<br/>\nthat what children need most of all is play, and what they need least is<br/>\nschooling, especially the usual -- ³traditional² --  type that we adults<br/>\nexperienced.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more our activities resemble the practices and theories of regular<br/>\nschool, the less effective they are (educationally and/or otherwise); and<br/>\nthe more our children¹s, and our, activities resemble play (and leisure) the<br/>\nmore effective they are. Our kid seemed to know that instinctively, since<br/>\nhis favorite expression was Churchill¹s, ³I love learning, but I hate being<br/>\ntaught.²  <br/>\n<br/>\nTrust Your Kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nLuz and I were inspired by the writings of John Holt, The Teenage Liberation<br/>\nHandbook by Grace Llewellen, Linda Dobson&#39;s books, Free At Last, by Daniel<br/>\nGreenberg (Sudbury), and Mark Twain, ³Don¹t let your schooling get in the<br/>\nway of your education.² Looks like the start of a Suggested Reading List --<br/>\ndoes anyone else have suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt&#39;s books: Teach Your Own,  How Children Learn,  Escape From<br/>\nChildhood,  Learning All The Time, Instead of Education,  Never Too Late,<br/>\nFreedom and Beyond, How Children Fail, What Do I Do Monday?
