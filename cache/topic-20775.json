I would definitely pull her <br/>\n  if she were \u000f<br/>\n  unhappy. The main reason I want to send her is that I <br/>\n  think this \u000f<br/>\n  particular year at this particular school might help <br/>\n  her blossom in \u000f<br/>\n  certain ways. If it&#39;s not a positive experience, <br/>\n  though, then there \u000f<br/>\n  is no point. \u000f<br/>\n  \u000f<br/>\n  BTW we are in Mendocino County. \u000f<br/>\n  \u000f<br/>\n  Very cute story about the dolls and the &quot;consensus&quot;!. <br/>\n  We were in the \u000f<br/>\n  car the other day and Willis (my 5 y.o.) was asking <br/>\n  lots of questions \u000f<br/>\n  about how the world began and how did the first person <br/>\n  get here and \u000f<br/>\n  what would happen if all the people died, and do ducks <br/>\n  have ears, and \u000f<br/>\n  at one point as I was answering one of her questions, <br/>\n  she said, &quot;Mom, \u000f<br/>\n  another quesiton just popped into my head. If it&#39;s all <br/>\n  right with \u000f<br/>\n  you, I&#39;d like to move on now.&quot; I was glad it was dark <br/>\n  and she \u000f<br/>\n  couldn&#39;t see my smile!\u000f<br/>\n  \u000f<br/>\n  Again, thanks for your thoughts. \u000f<br/>\n  \u000f<br/>\n  Ashley\u000f<br/>\n  \u000f<br/>\n<br/>\n  My concern with this would be as someone else has <br/>\n  mentioned, the shedding of the grade-system, or taken <br/>\n  further, the deschooling needed if she were to leave, <br/>\n  cos it really doesn&#39;t matter how idyllic it is, it&#39;s <br/>\n  still a school.  Even Summerhill&#39;s still a school <br/>\n  (though very different :-) )  The systems of appraisal, <br/>\n  whatever reward-system existed, the expectations to <br/>\n  conform...  those things, unless absolutely compatible <br/>\n  with your own home-life would need to be unlearnt.  And <br/>\n  I can also envisage that after such an idyllic start to <br/>\n  school she would be greatly disillusioned by the later <br/>\n  stages of school (vis the people who&#39;ve told you how <br/>\n  awful the rest of their school career was) but still <br/>\n  find it difficult to shed those attributes which school <br/>\n  would instill.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m basically thinking &#39;why run the risk of needing to <br/>\n  deschool?&#39;  Why spend that time undoing what needn&#39;t be <br/>\n  done in the first place.

My dilemma may seem odd to you -- it seems odd to me!<br/>\n  &gt; But I would love to have the feedback of this wise and experienced<br/>\n  &gt; group to a decision I&#39;m currently facing over whether to send my<br/>\n  &gt; older daughter to kindergarten part-time next year.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Here&#39;s my situation: I&#39;ve been committed to homeschooling my kids<br/>\n  &gt; (now 2 and 5) since the late &#39;80&#39;s, before I even knew when or<br/>\n  &gt; whether or with whom I&#39;d have them. I&#39;m still committed to<br/>\n  &gt; homeschooling them, and unschooling is the way I&#39;d like to go.<br/>\n  &gt; But . . . we live in a very small town (pop. about 700 in 100 square<br/>\n  &gt; miles) in northern California with a truly wonderful elementary<br/>\n  &gt; school. Four grades in two classrooms, K-1 and 2-3, with about 25<br/>\n  &gt; students altogether. (From 4th grade through high school kids are<br/>\n  &gt; bussed 1/2 hour to the next town.) We have no preschool or organized<br/>\n  &gt; childcare, so it&#39;s the first such experience for most of the<br/>\n  &gt; kindergartners. The kids have a beautiful meadow and a small grove of<br/>\n  &gt; redwood trees to run around in, in addition to swings, slides, ball<br/>\n  &gt; court, etc. There are two teachers, two part-time aides, and some<br/>\n  &gt; volunteers. The head teacher, an accomplished fiddler in her spare<br/>\n  &gt; time,  has 27 years at this school and loves our quirky  little<br/>\n  &gt; community (think &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; without the snow and you get a<br/>\n  &gt; good feel for our town), and it loves her. The kindergarten<br/>\n  &gt; curriculum is very play oriented, with lots of time for free play<br/>\n  &gt; with blocks, dress up, art, etc. They sing every day. The kids are<br/>\n  &gt; taught by word and deed to respect and be interested in and care for<br/>\n  &gt; one another. And they do. The school has the feeling of a loving<br/>\n  &gt; extended family.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; In the ten years I&#39;ve lived here, more than one person has used the<br/>\n  &gt; word &quot;magical&quot; to me in talking about their experience at this<br/>\n  &gt; school. More than one teenager or twentysomething has said, in<br/>\n  &gt; essence, &quot;School is (was) horrible, but my kindergarten year with<br/>\n  &gt; Judy was wonderful and it gave me warm, fuzzy memories I&#39;ll treasure<br/>\n  &gt; my whole life.&quot; I&#39;ve always known this school was pretty special, and<br/>\n  &gt; have joked that if anything could lure me away from homeschooling, it<br/>\n  &gt; would be this teacher. Now, having spent a day there with my daughter<br/>\n  &gt; last week, it&#39;s not a joke anymore!<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; This is probably the best chance my kids will ever have to experience<br/>\n  &gt; group life in a positive, nurturing setting. Girl Scouts, 4-H,<br/>\n  &gt; gymnastics lessons (all at least 1/2 hour away), camp, whatever, just<br/>\n  &gt; don&#39;t have the same continuity and intimacy that this school offers,<br/>\n  &gt; and there&#39;s no cohesive HS support group in our area. Our tiny town,<br/>\n  &gt; which I love,  has a very strong identity and this school is a big<br/>\n  &gt; part of it, and I&#39;d like my daughter to bond and develop some<br/>\n  &gt; friendships with the other kids her age in our community.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; The school is very flexible and will let my daugher attend just three<br/>\n  &gt; days a week, for a total of 11 hours. (The teacher, knowing I planned<br/>\n  &gt; to homeschool, has been asking me hopefully since my daughter was two<br/>\n  &gt; whether she&#39;d get to have her in her class.) WE could take time off<br/>\n  &gt; for travel anytime. My daughter seems ready and will be even more so<br/>\n  &gt; by fall. She already knows and likes at least half the kids who would<br/>\n  &gt; be in her K-1 class.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; The experience she would have is exactly what I&#39;d want for her for<br/>\n  &gt; kindergarten -- the chance to mix it up in a happy, supportive group<br/>\n  &gt; and learn something about herself in relation to other people, both<br/>\n  &gt; adults and children. &quot;Socializing&quot; in the most positive sense of the<br/>\n  &gt; word, if you will. Academically she&#39;d learn a few things and have<br/>\n  &gt; some fun, but that&#39;s not really what I&#39;m aiming for at this point in<br/>\n  &gt; her life. Since it&#39;s a mixed K-1 classroom, she&#39;s not likely to be<br/>\n  &gt; bored in the areas she&#39;s ahead in, and the kids all work at their own<br/>\n  &gt; pace anyway.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Apart from the fact that it&#39;s not what I had originally planned, at<br/>\n  &gt; this point I can&#39;t think of any reason not to send her. Even dh, who<br/>\n  &gt; is *very* anti-school (though he&#39;d never heard of homeschooling till<br/>\n  &gt; he met me!), think it&#39;s a good idea. And this is where I&#39;d like some<br/>\n  &gt; help -- am I missing something? Are there pitfalls I&#39;m not aware of<br/>\n  &gt; or questions I should be asking myself (or someone else) that I&#39;m<br/>\n  &gt; not? We would want only to do the kindergarten year. First grade very<br/>\n  &gt; possibly, but it would take up many more hours in the week, and I<br/>\n  &gt; also think that more than one or two years at school it would hold<br/>\n  &gt; her back intellectually. (Besides, I&#39;d miss her too much!) The one<br/>\n  &gt; concern I have is that she may resist staying home for first grade<br/>\n  &gt; after having enjoyed kindergarten. (Though a well-timed month-long<br/>\n  &gt; trip that October may help her over that!)<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; If you&#39;re still reading, sorry I went on so long! But I wanted to<br/>\n  &gt; give as thorough a picture as possible of our situation. Any<br/>\n  &gt; thoughts, ideas, experiences, you can offer to help me make the right<br/>\n  &gt; decision would be very much appreciated. No flames, please, but I<br/>\n  &gt; welcome insights and discussion from all points of view.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Many thanks for your wisdom (and patience!)<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Ashley Harvie<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n  &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n  &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n  &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Your use of Yahoo!

I&#39;m still committed to<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling them, and unschooling is the way I&#39;d like to go.<br/>\n&gt; But . . . we live in a very small town (pop. about 700 in 100 square<br/>\n&gt; miles) in northern California with a truly wonderful elementary<br/>\n&gt; school.

The head teacher, an accomplished fiddler in her spare<br/>\n&gt; time,  has 27 years at this school and loves our quirky  little<br/>\n&gt; community (think &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; without the snow and you get a<br/>\n&gt; good feel for our town), and it loves her. The kindergarten<br/>\n&gt; curriculum is very play oriented, with lots of time for free play<br/>\n&gt; with blocks, dress up, art, etc. They sing every day. The kids are<br/>\n&gt; taught by word and deed to respect and be interested in and care for<br/>\n&gt; one another. And they do. The school has the feeling of a loving<br/>\n&gt; extended family.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the ten years I&#39;ve lived here, more than one person has used the<br/>\n&gt; word &quot;magical&quot; to me in talking about their experience at this<br/>\n&gt; school. More than one teenager or twentysomething has said, in<br/>\n&gt; essence, &quot;School is (was) horrible, but my kindergarten year with<br/>\n&gt; Judy was wonderful and it gave me warm, fuzzy memories I&#39;ll treasure<br/>\n&gt; my whole life.&quot; I&#39;ve always known this school was pretty special, and<br/>\n&gt; have joked that if anything could lure me away from homeschooling, it<br/>\n&gt; would be this teacher.

Our tiny town,<br/>\n&gt; which I love,  has a very strong identity and this school is a big<br/>\n&gt; part of it, and I&#39;d like my daughter to bond and develop some<br/>\n&gt; friendships with the other kids her age in our community.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The school is very flexible and will let my daugher attend just three<br/>\n&gt; days a week, for a total of 11 hours. (The teacher, knowing I planned<br/>\n&gt; to homeschool, has been asking me hopefully since my daughter was two<br/>\n&gt; whether she&#39;d get to have her in her class.) WE could take time off<br/>\n&gt; for travel anytime. My daughter seems ready and will be even more so<br/>\n&gt; by fall.

Academically she&#39;d learn a few things and have<br/>\n&gt; some fun, but that&#39;s not really what I&#39;m aiming for at this point in<br/>\n&gt; her life. Since it&#39;s a mixed K-1 classroom, she&#39;s not likely to be<br/>\n&gt; bored in the areas she&#39;s ahead in, and the kids all work at their own<br/>\n&gt; pace anyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Apart from the fact that it&#39;s not what I had originally planned, at<br/>\n&gt; this point I can&#39;t think of any reason not to send her.

As I read your post, it occurs to me that about the only problem<br/>\nyou have with making that decision and feeling comfortable with it is that<br/>\nit is labeled &#39;kindergarten&#39; and &#39;public school&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if it were me, I would remind myself that no one else knows my child or<br/>\nmy circumstances as well as I do and make the decision my family will be<br/>\nmost comfortable with.  The rest of the crowd be hanged.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am making a couple of assumptions here.  One is that you are not required<br/>\nto commit to 12 years of ps just because DD goes to ps kindergarten (I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink that&#39;s the case anywhere in the country, but you never know).  And<br/>\nthat any extra hoops you may have to jump through to extricate your DD. from<br/>\nthe system after next year will be worth it to you.  (In some cases it is<br/>\nMUCH easier to start out as homeschoolers than to leave the ps system to<br/>\nhomeschool.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I do have one caution...it may be difficult for your DD to leave<br/>\nbehind her friends next year and return home to continue her education.  If<br/>\nit were me, I&#39;d be sure to take steps to help her with that future<br/>\nadjustment from the beginning.  But that&#39;s me.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor what it&#39;s worth...go for it!  Enjoy the rich environment your daughter<br/>\nwill be exposed to.  Attend with her on a regular basis, if you can.  Make<br/>\nit a family affair.  That may make it easier for DD to make the adjustment<br/>\nto being back home after her kindergarten year and you&#39;ll know what&#39;s going<br/>\non because you are there with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see no reason to reject a program that fits your lifestyle, needs and<br/>\ndesires.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck either way!<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonal story so you have a little idea of where I&#39;m coming from...our<br/>\nyoungest child has never attended ps.  His birthday is late in the year, so<br/>\nhe missed the dates to attend kindergarten the same year his cousins started<br/>\nschool (4 of them born the same year and very close to each other).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wanted to go and was very prepared by all the ps standards.  I asked the<br/>\nschool if they would waive the birthday requirement and they would not even<br/>\nentertain the idea.  I was peeved at the time.  In fact, it got really<br/>\ninteresting because my ds (youngest of the pack of 4 cousins) was the most<br/>\nexcited about the idea of school, was actually reading and had been doing<br/>\nmental math for over a year at that time.  OTOH the other cousins, who were<br/>\nrequired to attend ps (by their parents...they are all aware of homeschool<br/>\noptions), hated going to school!  Every one of the families had a struggle<br/>\ngetting the little darlings to cooperate and get to school on time and<br/>\nbehave themselves while they were there.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DS and I?  We have totally enjoyed homeschooling and never looked back.<br/>\nHe quickly lost any sense of missing out and there has been more than one<br/>\noccasion where the cousins are obviously jealous because DS doesn&#39;t have to<br/>\ndo school all day every day.  I would never have believed it at the time,<br/>\nbut the local district actually did me a favor by keeping us out of the<br/>\nsystem at the only time I&#39;ve ever been tempted to join their ranks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I would never judge someone else for making a different<br/>\ndecision.  IMO that&#39;s what homeschooling is about:  keeping the options open<br/>\nso families can make the decisions that are best for them.  I just thought<br/>\nyou might like to know how it worked out for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"vouget@hotmail.com","from":"vouget@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"CxfTrxudNvzEcHTfZQvRo2ifpetCxkp22Tlti_jX5x2y3bTcLWHE1pksNvEV-f86OP4BKqWRdXuY","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Kindergarten dilemma (very long, sorry)","postDate":"989326648","msgId":20791,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlkOHFmbys3bDFhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDlkODNhcStrZDZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":20775,"nextInTopic":20793,"prevInTime":20790,"nextInTime":20792,"topicId":20775,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... deal ...  *Sounds like fun.

I personally find<br/>\nany group that is fashioned similar to school too limiting.  We had a home<br/>\nschool play group and even though all the mom&#39;s were there (and were quite<br/>\nnice) and there were only 6 families, it ended up feeling like school.  We<br/>\nlearned to wait in line, to listen to apologies when we got knocked down<br/>\n(sometimes), to question why someone would do such and such, to feel left<br/>\nout...... I could go on and on.  Some people think children need to deal<br/>\nwith adversity as kids in order to learn to deal with it as an adult.  I do<br/>\nnot agree with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that having a close friend or a few close friends is much more<br/>\nrewarding than being aquaintances with a larger group of peers.  It sounds<br/>\nall warm and fuzzy, but will it really be all that?  Is your child an<br/>\nintrovert or an extrovert?  My own introverted children just do not enjoy<br/>\ngroups of people as well as they enjoy one on one playdates.  One of my<br/>\ndaughters expressed that she wanted to go, ( I think it sounded appealing)<br/>\nbut she always looked lost and miserable while she was there.  If you are<br/>\ndoing it because you think it is her only chance to have that warm fuzzy<br/>\nfeeling of caring and belonging to a group, I think your thoughts are as<br/>\nmisguided as mine were. (no offense intended) It is just that it sounds<br/>\nbetter on the outside than it really is in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry that I am unable to articulate what I am feeling.

My dilemma may seem odd to you -- it seems odd to me! <br/>\nBut I would love to have the feedback of this wise and experienced <br/>\ngroup to a decision I&#39;m currently facing over whether to send my <br/>\nolder daughter to kindergarten part-time next year.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my situation: I&#39;ve been committed to homeschooling my kids <br/>\n(now 2 and 5) since the late &#39;80&#39;s, before I even knew when or <br/>\nwhether or with whom I&#39;d have them. I&#39;m still committed to <br/>\nhomeschooling them, and unschooling is the way I&#39;d like to go. <br/>\nBut . . . we live in a very small town (pop. about 700 in 100 square <br/>\nmiles) in northern California with a truly wonderful elementary <br/>\nschool. Four grades in two classrooms, K-1 and 2-3, with about 25 <br/>\nstudents altogether. (From 4th grade through high school kids are <br/>\nbussed 1/2 hour to the next town.) We have no preschool or organized <br/>\nchildcare, so it&#39;s the first such experience for most of the <br/>\nkindergartners. The kids have a beautiful meadow and a small grove of <br/>\nredwood trees to run around in, in addition to swings, slides, ball <br/>\ncourt, etc. There are two teachers, two part-time aides, and some <br/>\nvolunteers. The head teacher, an accomplished fiddler in her spare <br/>\ntime,  has 27 years at this school and loves our quirky  little <br/>\ncommunity (think &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; without the snow and you get a <br/>\ngood feel for our town), and it loves her. The kindergarten <br/>\ncurriculum is very play oriented, with lots of time for free play <br/>\nwith blocks, dress up, art, etc. They sing every day. The kids are <br/>\ntaught by word and deed to respect and be interested in and care for <br/>\none another. And they do. The school has the feeling of a loving <br/>\nextended family. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the ten years I&#39;ve lived here, more than one person has used the <br/>\nword &quot;magical&quot; to me in talking about their experience at this <br/>\nschool. More than one teenager or twentysomething has said, in <br/>\nessence, &quot;School is (was) horrible, but my kindergarten year with <br/>\nJudy was wonderful and it gave me warm, fuzzy memories I&#39;ll treasure <br/>\nmy whole life.&quot; I&#39;ve always known this school was pretty special, and <br/>\nhave joked that if anything could lure me away from homeschooling, it <br/>\nwould be this teacher. Now, having spent a day there with my daughter <br/>\nlast week, it&#39;s not a joke anymore!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is probably the best chance my kids will ever have to experience <br/>\ngroup life in a positive, nurturing setting. Girl Scouts, 4-H, <br/>\ngymnastics lessons (all at least 1/2 hour away), camp, whatever, just <br/>\ndon&#39;t have the same continuity and intimacy that this school offers, <br/>\nand there&#39;s no cohesive HS support group in our area. Our tiny town, <br/>\nwhich I love,  has a very strong identity and this school is a big <br/>\npart of it, and I&#39;d like my daughter to bond and develop some <br/>\nfriendships with the other kids her age in our community.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe school is very flexible and will let my daugher attend just three <br/>\ndays a week, for a total of 11 hours. (The teacher, knowing I planned <br/>\nto homeschool, has been asking me hopefully since my daughter was two <br/>\nwhether she&#39;d get to have her in her class.) WE could take time off <br/>\nfor travel anytime. My daughter seems ready and will be even more so <br/>\nby fall. She already knows and likes at least half the kids who would <br/>\nbe in her K-1 class.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe experience she would have is exactly what I&#39;d want for her for <br/>\nkindergarten -- the chance to mix it up in a happy, supportive group <br/>\nand learn something about herself in relation to other people, both <br/>\nadults and children. &quot;Socializing&quot; in the most positive sense of the <br/>\nword, if you will. Academically she&#39;d learn a few things and have <br/>\nsome fun, but that&#39;s not really what I&#39;m aiming for at this point in <br/>\nher life. Since it&#39;s a mixed K-1 classroom, she&#39;s not likely to be <br/>\nbored in the areas she&#39;s ahead in, and the kids all work at their own <br/>\npace anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nApart from the fact that it&#39;s not what I had originally planned, at <br/>\nthis point I can&#39;t think of any reason not to send her. Even dh, who <br/>\nis *very* anti-school (though he&#39;d never heard of homeschooling till <br/>\nhe met me!), think it&#39;s a good idea. And this is where I&#39;d like some <br/>\nhelp -- am I missing something? Are there pitfalls I&#39;m not aware of <br/>\nor questions I should be asking myself (or someone else) that I&#39;m <br/>\nnot? We would want only to do the kindergarten year. First grade very <br/>\npossibly, but it would take up many more hours in the week, and I <br/>\nalso think that more than one or two years at school it would hold <br/>\nher back intellectually. (Besides, I&#39;d miss her too much!) The one <br/>\nconcern I have is that she may resist staying home for first grade <br/>\nafter having enjoyed kindergarten. (Though a well-timed month-long <br/>\ntrip that October may help her over that!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re still reading, sorry I went on so long! But I wanted to <br/>\ngive as thorough a picture as possible of our situation.
