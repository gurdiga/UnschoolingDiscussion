Huh? He was just<br/>\nbeing silly, not mean or anything, but it made me realize how much he<br/>\nenjoyed going to the blog during his week and reading about the kids and our<br/>\nadventures. I guess just being able to read something when he feels like<br/>\ntaking a break, something that&#39;s not addressed to him or pushing a<br/>\nparticular agenda, really holds an appeal for him. I don&#39;t know if a blog<br/>\nwould work in your case, but it has become an interesting form of<br/>\ncommunication with my dh that I never foresaw.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note...<br/>\nDh and I seem to go in circles about unschooling. He&#39;s totally on board and<br/>\nthen busts out with some really inappropriate remark like, &quot;Well, we have to<br/>\nexpose them to math; otherwise, how will they be able to do word problems?&quot;<br/>\nHe&#39;s clearly distorting the word &quot;expose&quot; in a way that makes me really<br/>\nuncomfortable--we&#39;ll be coming back to this during our hot tub therapy<br/>\nsessions. *g* This came out the other evening when we were discussing a<br/>\npossible move to Virginia where either portfolio review or testing is<br/>\nmandatory every year. Sigh. Maybe my blog will begin to have a dh-aimed<br/>\nagenda after all! *eg*<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, though, I&#39;m thinking these worries manifest themselves as he&#39;s<br/>\nprojecting the kids into the future. He&#39;s supportive about what&#39;s going on<br/>\nnow, has backed off about reading, etc. My hope is that the blog and other<br/>\nconversations will help him continue to be okay with the present all along,<br/>\nif you know what I mean. The more years he can do that, the more likely I<br/>\nthink he is to let go of concerns over the future. I think he will begin to<br/>\nsee that he&#39;s worrying uselessly as he realizes that the kids really are<br/>\nokay and really are learning loads of things that make word problems and<br/>\nother schooly things look silly and abstract. It&#39;s just hard for him to make<br/>\nthose connections now.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97036,"nextTopicId":97002}}
