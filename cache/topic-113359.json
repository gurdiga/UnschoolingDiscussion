I put a fairly large amount of effort into <br/>\nfinding toothpaste that Rosie liked and I&#39;m careful to buy the kind she <br/>\nlikes, still. Roxana doesn&#39;t take pills - she gags on them. So I buy her <br/>\nliquid tylenol from a drugstore near &quot;Leisure World&quot; - a retirement <br/>\ncommunity. And I bought a pill crusher a long time ago and if she has to <br/>\ntake something, she&#39;ll crush it up and put it in applesauce or <br/>\nsomething. It really isn&#39;t a big deal to do these things and life is <br/>\nmuch better for it. We can put that kind of effort into finding foods <br/>\nour kids really like that don&#39;t hurt them IF there is a real need for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had visitors from out of the country, staying with us, once. The mom <br/>\nwas forcing a pill down her little girls&#39; throat - the girl was probably <br/>\n6 years old or so. And the mom was forcing the pill down - literally <br/>\nholding the child&#39;s head back and shoving the pill down her throat. You <br/>\ncan guess what happened - the girl threw up all over the place, gagged <br/>\non THAT and choked and it was a huge mess with a hysterical child and <br/>\nfurious mom and it pretty much ruined our whole evening. It was awful. <br/>\nRoya was about 3 and she was very very shocked and upset.  There&#39;s just <br/>\nno need - there are other ways to do things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that we can kind of support our kids in eating pretty healthy <br/>\nfoods by just having the healthy foods they like around and offering <br/>\nthem. Slicing up fruit and serving it with bits of cheese and crackers <br/>\nwas always appreciated around my house. On cold days I&#39;d make sliced <br/>\napples with some cinnamon sprinkled on them and heat them up in the <br/>\nmicrowave. But, if they wanted something else - something &quot;less healthy&quot; <br/>\n- I&#39;d just provide that, too, without distinction.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is interesting, sometimes what we grow up with is what we really <br/>\nlike. Sometimes what we didn&#39;t have as kids seems like a big treat. My <br/>\nkids don&#39;t like whole milk, because we always had nonfat milk. To them, <br/>\nwhole milk is so thick and creamy that it only tastes good when just a <br/>\nbit is poured over something, but they wouldn&#39;t drink a glass of it. <br/>\nBut, we also only ever had dense thick dark bread - because that&#39;s just <br/>\nwhat &quot;I&quot; like and so, when they were little, it is what I bought and <br/>\nthat&#39;s what they thought of as &quot;bread.&quot; Turns out Roxana loves that kind <br/>\nof bread, too, and it is also what Roya prefers, but Rosie would much <br/>\nrather have lighter, airier breads. We didn&#39;t eat fish at all, because <br/>\n&quot;I&quot; don&#39;t like it - but Roya turns out to absolutely LOVE fish and eats <br/>\na lot of it, now, while Rox and Rosie don&#39;t like it, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think we&#39;re shaping our kids food choices for life the way some <br/>\nparents seem to think. They are going to end up to be individuals - they <br/>\nwill have their own tastes and preferences and those aren&#39;t really all <br/>\nthat predictable based on their childhoods.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, there are parents who seem to actually have some kind of want or <br/>\nneed for their kids to have food issues. They seem to be looking for <br/>\nthose issues to exist. Beth, your kid already has all kinds of <br/>\nfood-related problems - why on earth would you want to add another one <br/>\nto the list if it wasn&#39;t absolutely life-threateningly necessary? You <br/>\nand your husband are worried about him getting fat, and your first <br/>\nreaction is to find some additional food to restrict? Have you found <br/>\nways to get more active? Do you go out and do stuff together - run and <br/>\nplay? Do you have a Wii Fit? A mini-trampoline? Bikes, skates, <br/>\nskateboards? Do you go skiing or swimming? I&#39;m going to be blunt and say <br/>\nthat I think the two of you probably have food issues, yourselves, and <br/>\nyou&#39;re projecting those onto your son.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, my recommendation would be to try your best to down-play the <br/>\nother issues to the maximum extent possible. Try to ignore them. Try to <br/>\nfind other solutions to the problems he has. Question question question <br/>\nwhether the food is REALLY the culprit and whether restricting foods is <br/>\nreally doing more harm than good. My heart is going out to this poor kid <br/>\nwho has, in his his short life, already been experimented on so much <br/>\n(which is what those rotation diets, etc. are - they are experiments on <br/>\na child). Let everything that isn&#39;t actually life-threatening go (and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t mean that he might have high cholesterol in 30 years if he eats <br/>\nsomething now, I mean immediately life-threatening). OFFER foods that <br/>\nare healthy for him, but don&#39;t deny him other things he wants, either.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Literacy and Dyslexia - some thoughts/questions","postDate":"1263422017","msgId":113381,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENCNzc1NEQwLTBCQzMtNEMxNC05RkI4LUZGQzQ3NjkwODc1Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDdFQzVEQzJDLTMzOTQtNDQxQS1BMDg4LUE4NUVDREUyOEJCNEBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGhpam1zbytwbzkxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8N0VDNURDMkMtMzM5NC00NDFBLUEwODgtQTg1RUNERTI4QkI0QGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":113380,"nextInTopic":113382,"prevInTime":113380,"nextInTime":113382,"topicId":113359,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-That is why I wondered about a diet being presented at a conference (though Alan has clarified ...-=- I m a little miffed that after I heard about it at a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-580504398\">-=-That is why I wondered about a diet being presented at a conference<br/>\n(though Alan has clarified ...-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a little miffed that after &quot;I heard about it at a conference&quot; it  <br/>\nturns out to have been some side conversation.

Many parents of so called autistic children (I really hate that label, by the way) completely reject bio-medical treatments of any kind and do only what their doctors say is proven to help. I think we agree that behavior therapies are quite damaging and do anything but help, but that is a lot of parents not forcing a change in diet.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that if my dd could communicate to her satisfaction and was happy I would never even consider influencing her diet in that way. My goal is to work with her to make her life better. I couldn&#39;t care less how hyper/ inattentive/ demanding/ argumentative/ disinterested/ defiant/ or picky she is. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am the exception for sure, because parenting unconventionally and respecting children&#39;s choices is the exception in general. But unschoolers help their children to brush their teeth, take medication, go to the doctor or dentist, wear more comfortable clothing like Pam mentioned, etc. - while respecting their children and putting their relationship with their children first, and I believe it is possible to do the same in regard to diet if there is a good reason (not an arbitrary or ill founded reason) to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlan<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n \t\t \t   \t\t  <br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYour E-mail and More On-the-Go.

I just want to point out that they are not inherently incompatible with unschooling. &quot;Eat whatever is around without consideration&quot; and &quot;only eat what I say no matter what&quot; are not the only two alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually first learned of the possibility of a gluten free diet at an unschooling conference.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlan<br/>\n \t\t \t   \t\t  <br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nHotmail: Trusted email with powerful SPAM protection.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clk.atdmt.com/GBL/go/196390707/direct/01/\">http://clk.atdmt.com/GBL/go/196390707/direct/01/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":414609447,"authorName":"flhomeschooling","from":"&quot;flhomeschooling&quot; &lt;andreavlarosa@...&gt;","profile":"flhomeschooling","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Literacy and Dyslexia - some thoughts/questions","postDate":"1263334103","msgId":113367,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhpaXJzbis1dWJtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQzNUNENjY3LUM4QkYtNEUyOS1CN0U1LUJBNTc1NjE0NkM5RUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":113365,"nextInTopic":113368,"prevInTime":113366,"nextInTime":113368,"topicId":113359,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The tests don&#39;t account for kids who refuse to be tested.

Then I had these labels and I would think, &quot;Well, he keeps banging on the table not because he&#39;s trying to wake up grandma from her nap, but because of the autism, he seeks out this type of stimulus. It&#39;s something he needs.&quot; This is an improvement over &quot;He keeps banging on the table because he&#39;s trying to get on my nerves/ be defiant/ be mean to grandma etc.&quot; But I would agree it&#39;s a very limited improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":414609447,"authorName":"flhomeschooling","from":"&quot;flhomeschooling&quot; &lt;andreavlarosa@...&gt;","profile":"flhomeschooling","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Literacy and Dyslexia - some thoughts/questions","postDate":"1263333101","msgId":113365,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhpaXF0ZCtqMDh2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQyQ0Y0NDczQkM4NTQ3MUY5MUVDMDI0MDYwQTY2MTZBQFJvYnluUEM+"},"prevInTopic":113362,"nextInTopic":113367,"prevInTime":113364,"nextInTime":113366,"topicId":113359,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Robyn, ...

I see this in my own grandmother, who was labeled outright STUPID because she couldn&#39;t read well in the 2nd grade and she&#39;s believed that her whole life, when she&#39;s a very bright woman. It&#39;s only recently that she&#39;s started saying things like &quot;Maybe the teachers just didn&#39;t know how to teach me.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You are falling into the same trap with your son, all the while struggling <br/>\n&gt; against it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was going to elaborate more on our situation and how I see things now in the last post, but I figured it was already long enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegrettably, I didn&#39;t trust my own judgment then. I had never been around babies in any capacity until I had my son at a very immature 21 and I was 100% clueless about child-rearing. Still, I saw him as totally normal until his pediatrician told me, when he was 2, that he was &quot;markedly&quot; delayed and needed &quot;intervention services.&quot; He made it sound so matter-of-fact and dire. The earlier he got these services, he told me, the better his chances of living a normal life. The implication was that he was on the fast track to having a miserable and abnormal life. I was very naive and found this terrifying, but I did not have the resources or confidence to contradict him. <br/>\n<br/>\nAutism discussion/support groups exacerbated this. A lot of the discussions that happen there are all about controlling your child&#39;s behavior to a MINUTE degree. Starting with the ubiquitous insistence on extreme food restriction. A lot of &quot;treatment&quot; for autism involves extreme subjugation of the child. It never sat well with me so fortunately I think I &quot;failed to follow through&quot; with the vast majority of the expert recommendations we got.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sought out services for him out of fear, ignorance and a sincere desire to see my baby happy. But mostly fear, that I wasn&#39;t equipped to parent him well, which is also what I heard from EVERYONE at the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see autism as a disability at all anymore. Usually I only bring it up for context about (and in) very specific situations, such as this conversation about learning disabilities. I almost never bring it up in &quot;real life&quot; to other people; I used to, in the hopes that it would make people less judgmental and mean about certain unusual behaviors, but it invariably made people MEANER toward him. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;you say that he was 6 <br/>\n&gt; before speaking in complete sentences, then immediately give an instance of <br/>\n&gt; him speaking in a sentence when he was 3 - &quot;in there&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Besides a few instances like that, he truly didn&#39;t talk much, if at all on some days, until he was 5 or 6, so it was often very hard for me to figure out what he wanted. I&#39;ll admit sometimes I didn&#39;t figure it out, and then the crying became about me not getting it. Usually, he wouldn&#39;t point or gesture to anything, he would just cry. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe started to say one or two words once he hit about 3 years of age. &quot;Juice.&quot;  &quot;Toy.&quot;  &quot;There.&quot; &quot;Play.&quot; &quot;No.&quot; But he didn&#39;t say things like &quot;I want juice&quot;&quot; or &quot;Give me that toy&quot; until he was much older. This mattered, because sometimes he would say &quot;toy&quot; or &quot;juice&quot; and I would think he meant &quot;give me the toy/juice&quot; and he really meant &quot;I vehemently LOATHE that toy/juice, put it away RIGHT NOW&quot; and he would scream and cry when I tried to give it to him anyway, or vice versa. It reinforced all the second-guessing I&#39;d been doing. :/<br/>\n<br/>\nHe still does not enjoy chit-chat (lots of people don&#39;t), still speaks slowly and will often start a sentence over 4 or 5 times until he gets it &quot;just right.&quot; I do not allow people to tell him things like &quot;Just spit it out already!&quot; or allow people to finish his sentences for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think you may not realize yourself how much these awful shadow assumptions <br/>\n&gt; tied up with these diaganoses of dyslexia (which you don&#39;t accept)  and <br/>\n&gt; autism (which you have proclaimed) <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>While I think that he does fit the criteria for the diagnosis, in our day to day lives, everything he does is normal to me. I have gotten better at being able to tell what he needs; he has more tools for communicating his needs now, too. Other people notice his more uncommon behaviors. Most people are cool, but sometimes people are really rude about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What if, instead of looking at him through the lens of autism, you looked <br/>\n&gt; only at his individual, personal traits, as being Who He Is today, without <br/>\n&gt; doing any kind of mental characterization of &quot;that is part of his autism&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I definitely think that is a wonderful ideal and am working toward it, thank you :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What if you stopped ever using the word &quot;delays&quot; in reference to him, which <br/>\n&gt; is a concept that is not helpful for unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Reading that over, I regret that I don&#39;t have a more positive way to talk about his frustration with this and that I made it sound like it&#39;s a shortcoming when it&#39;s not at all. He draws all the time and he&#39;s rarely happy with anything he does. I have gotten him so many &quot;how to draw&quot; books and resources that he&#39;s asked for. He found a lot of those very tedious. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think he wants to learn how to draw. He wants to ALREADY KNOW how to draw, so he can get out his ideas RIGHT NOW. It&#39;s not unlike the frustration he had with language when he was younger. He wanted the tools and skills to already be there so he could just get on with expressing himself the way he wanted to. The fact that they are not there to a degree that meets his immediate needs causes him a lot of stress and anxiety.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy &quot;struggle&quot; I mean &quot;put in a lot of energy for something and still not get anywhere near a result you&#39;re remotely happy with, which you then find upsetting and frustrating.&quot; I think he gets really disappointed with himself.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What new and interesting art supplies and materials might he be interested in?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am always on the look out for running cool stuff past him, suggestions are welcome :) I personally enjoy his drawings very much, but he doesn&#39;t enjoy that they&#39;re not to his standards and sadly I think he&#39;s starting to give up a little.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He survived the process of all this <br/>\n&gt; diagnosing.

Being a highly visual-spatial sort, he memorizes the &quot;spelling shape&quot; of words (&quot;that has an H in the middle, because I remember it&#39;s short-tall-short!&quot;) as a way to more easily remember spelling. He didn&#39;t speak in complete sentences until he was 6, but I remember him being 3 years old and saying &quot;PIZZA!&quot; when we walked by a new pizza restaurant with him in his little stroller. He had never seen the restaurant before and didn&#39;t already know what they sold there. I stopped and looked up, and sure enough, there was a large &quot;PIZZA!&quot; neon sign in the window. Incredulous, I said, &quot;Where&#39;s the pizza?&quot; and he pointed to the sign and said gleefully &quot;In there!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that he started doing things like that with words like &quot;Stop&quot; (on stop signs), &quot;Pets&quot; (he loves animals) and of course, &quot;toys.&quot; *g* And so on. I read him stories, but I had never made any effort to teach him to read, nor did he watch any shows that taught him about letters, like Sesame Street, which he didn&#39;t get into until later when he was already reading. He just intuitively understood word-shapes have verbal and conceptual equivalents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also remember that when I first started homeschooling him when he was 5, I had no idea what I was doing and one of the things I bought were some phonics flashcards from Amazon.com. I decided to do one per day with him to &quot;teach him to read&quot;. The first day I showed them to him, he grabbed them from my hand and took off with them. He ate them up and he was reading Dr. Seuss level books by himself in 3 weeks. I knew even then that I totally had not &quot;taught him to read.&quot; I gave him some flash cards that he found useful in unlocking alpha-numeric literacy.  I didn&#39;t even get to explain to him how the damn flashcards were supposed to work! lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet... over and over, he was diagnosed as dyslexic as a child, when in retrospect, that has clearly never been the case. I think maybe people thought he SHOULD be dyslexic because most autistic people are thought to be dyslexic, or they would see 3 other people before them had put &quot;dyslexic&quot; on his charts so they would just assume it was accurate without seeing for themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, Eli does have severe large and fine motor delays and he still struggles to draw and write, something that frustrates him because he loves to draw, so the other &quot;comorbid&quot; diagnosis he got, dysgraphia, is probably accurate, but he is NOT dyslexic. He&#39;s actually turned out to be a superlative speller! But at LEAST half a dozen psychologists and developmental diagnosticians diagnosed him as such, as recently as 3 years ago when he was already capable of fluently reading the front page of a newspaper out loud. I don&#39;t get it. When I pointed this out to the last guy, he actually IGNORED me, didn&#39;t respond, and wrote &quot;dyslexia&quot; on his little chart anyway!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Eli was going through the rounds of testing for various therapeutic services, I heard a lot of things like &quot;The vast majority of kids with _________ also have ________ so it&#39;s safe to assume your son has __________.&quot; I think this happens a lot when kids get diagnosed as learning-disabled. They just get stuffed into a diagnostic box that&#39;s easier to deal with than actual individuals. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is a lot assuming and &quot;most kids have this&quot; going on, perhaps well-intentioned because if the kid doesn&#39;t have the label he doesn&#39;t get the services he may really need. One diagnostician told me the more labels that Eli was &quot;able to get,&quot; the &quot;better,&quot; because then he would get &quot;a bunch of help&quot; (regardless of whether or not he needed it?? I guess?? lol) There was this pervasive sense of urgency to diagnose the kid with as many acronyms and disorders as humanly possible. It was this weird sort of Munchausen by Proxy... by Proxy. Eventually I just gave up and decided not to get him any services. Somehow he&#39;s survived. Cough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many stories of kids in the public school who NEVER &quot;escape&quot; the special education label they got as a 5-year-old even if they&#39;re doing calculus and independently reading Chaucer as a 14-year-old.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I have a very sweet acquaintance who is 30 years old and really is dyslexic, or appears to be. He is a brilliant man and listens to audiobooks every day. He CAN read, it&#39;s just a huge struggle for him, and he&#39;s an awful, awful speller. He uses text-to-speech recognition to read things the Internet; he will follow along visually but he gets most of the information aurally. He uses Dragon Speak to speak all his emails and typed things on the Internet, and does what the blind person in that article Jenny posted does - listens to the WSJ every day and things like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut he still feels limited by his dyslexia, and it has profoundly frustrated him his whole life. There is a lot of reading in his career choice and it takes him so much longer to do things like read reports than people who are alpha-numerically fluent, and he doesn&#39;t catch on to things other people might get just by skimming a document, something he can&#39;t do, and I think it causes him a lot of stress. Yet, I feel like I can hardly say he&#39;s illiterate as he&#39;s read the entire works of Austen, Dickens, Morrison, Fitzgerald, Hemingway and many other &quot;greats&quot; on audiobook, and he has an expansive and impressive vocabulary and is incredibly articulate, knowledgeable and eloquent when speaking. I don&#39;t think even the most conventional academic standards would judge him formally uneducated. But he is technically &quot;illiterate&quot; and self-deprecatingly describes himself as such.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there must be some people who really want to read, but something in their brains just won&#39;t let them do it. But I don&#39;t think those people are anywhere near as ubiquitous as &quot;special education&quot; in school would have us believe. And by another token, what literacy is *must* be more than &quot;being able to decode and understand written symbols as a proxy for verbal expression.&quot; Thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48275,"nextTopicId":113250}}
