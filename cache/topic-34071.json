At the moment, it is braces. Her grandmother offered to pay for them, she decided she wanted to do it and is about 5 months into it. At this point, she is re-evaulating that decision. And I support that. Her grandmother may get very upset with her if she decides to take them off. But it is Lil&#39;s body and life, and ultimately, her choice as to what she does. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has decided she didn&#39;t like a few things she has tried and she has stopped and we really had no big deal over it. If I were doing an activity and I didn&#39;t like it, I would quit as well. I think the best we can do is share with them what we would do in that situation, if they ask (and my daughter almost always ask this question). She recently had been asked to go on a trip with someone to the Bahamas, which she scheduled to go and we bought an airline ticket. Then, a class that she had been waiting for on songwriting was scheduled for the day she was to leave. She agonized over it for over a week, and decided to forgo the trip and do the class. We will lose some money on the ticket, perhaps all of it if we don&#39;t take a trip to the Bahama&#39;s in the next year. I will consider it an expensive but probably well worth it class. But it is something she values greatly, and she gave up something she really wanted to do as well. I think it was a great experience and opportunity in making decisions and how that process works. . . .something very valuable to learn I think. I think each experience presents to us an opportunity. It may not be the exact one we were thinking of, but always one is there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the list, by the way. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] On Again / Off Again Interests<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My son is nine.  He wanted to join the local homeschool band.  We <br/>\n  said &quot;yes&quot;, he chose to play snare drums, we paid the band fee, <br/>\n  rental fees, and as he asked for lessons, signed him up, and of <br/>\n  course paid for the lessons.  After a few lessons, he wanted to quit <br/>\n  lessons, so we let him.  After a couple of months of band, he wanted <br/>\n  to quit, and so we let him.  After seeing his sister perform with the <br/>\n  band at the winter concert he wanted to join again.  The director <br/>\n  said &quot;no&quot; as he would be too far behind the &quot;beginner&quot; group, but <br/>\n  suggested that he rent drums again and practice on his own until the <br/>\n  beginner band starts again in September.  She suggested that if he <br/>\n  was beyond &quot;beginner&quot; by that time, he could play w/ the &quot;advanced&quot; <br/>\n  band.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Soooooooo, what do we do?  Do we incur the expenses of drums all over <br/>\n  again?  When parents pay for lessons / equipment rental / buy <br/>\n  uniforms etc., is it reasonable to require our children to practice?  <br/>\n  My unschooling gut says &quot;no&quot;, it needs to come from the child, <br/>\n  whether it&#39;s practice, or finishing a session / class that has been <br/>\n  paid for.  But I must admit, I feel frustrated with the expense (we <br/>\n  have three children) and with the &quot;I want to do it - I don&#39;t like it <br/>\n  anymore - I want to try it again&quot; roller coaster.  This has happened <br/>\n  with both of our older children in many different activities - <br/>\n  soccer, gymnastics, drama, bowling, guitar, violin, piano, science <br/>\n  classes, and the list goes on!<br/>\n<br/>\n  And it isn&#39;t just trying an activity and deciding it&#39;s not their cup <br/>\n  of tea - after quitting for a while, they will often want to rejoin <br/>\n  that same activity.  I&#39;ve noticed other recurring situations as <br/>\n  well.  My daughter loves singing & acting (she is ten), but if she is <br/>\n  engrossed in an activity e.g. computer game, reading a book, playing <br/>\n  barbies, she will downright throw a tantrum about going to choir or <br/>\n  acting class (which she begged to join - and often talks excitedly <br/>\n  about after class!).  <br/>\n<br/>\n  And what about the children who are along for the ride in the car as <br/>\n  one child attends their particular activity?  How much of this is <br/>\n  reasonable or sane?  I want to honor and respect their moods, and <br/>\n  support what they are interested in learning about, but... this feels <br/>\n  a bit indulgent for some reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I would appreciate any and all suggestions  regarding this topic - <br/>\n  especially as to how unschoolers handle similar situations!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Shelly<br/>\n  A mom who loves reading Holt, and is trying to put it into practice <br/>\n  despite various insecurities which flare up from time to time!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

It seems to me that one of the <br/>\nthings you learn in life is that when you make a commitment (having a pet, <br/>\npeace corps, getting married, having children, whatever) there are going to <br/>\nbe times you wish you could take a break from it, or step aside, or even <br/>\nquit, but the end result is valuable enough that you want to sustain through <br/>\nthe rough patches so you get to that end result.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother had me in piano lessons from 4 to 16.

I chose horses, <br/>\nand eventually they bought me a horse. However, there was a lot of <br/>\ndiscussion of &quot;when you get this horse...&quot; to clarify that the horse meant a <br/>\ncommitment. I couldn&#39;t have turned up the next day saying I didn&#39;t much care <br/>\nfor horses after all. I mean, I suppose I could have, but it wouldn&#39;t have <br/>\nbeen well received. There were lots of days where I would rather not have <br/>\nhad the responsibility -- but I learned that the long term benefits were <br/>\nworth the short term irritation of winter days and cleaning tack, etc. <br/>\nActually there was never ever a moment where I wanted to quit horses - I was <br/>\nin love. And I blame this on the fact that they let me really explore LOTS <br/>\nof different things on a short term, no-commitment basis, before making a <br/>\ncommitment to one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess my feelings about this are mixed. I hate the idea of the parent <br/>\nactualizing his/her own dreams through the child -- making him play football <br/>\nor the violin or whatever because the parent wants him to. On the other <br/>\nhand, I wouldn&#39;t want to let my child drift from thing to thing, quitting <br/>\nwhenever it got difficult or bothersome. There are lots of things in life <br/>\nthat have moments of difficulty or irritation, when you wish you could bag <br/>\nit. Having a child not the least of these! But if it&#39;s your passion, you <br/>\npersevere. I guess putting the time in at the outset to let the kid find his <br/>\nreal passion (for me it was horses) will save agony with indecision later -- <br/>\nbut there are some things (like the piano lessons for me) that a child just <br/>\nmay not be able to see long term benefits of, and should be taught that you <br/>\nstay with it and persevere regardless of your feelings at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d hate to see a child learn to approach commitment with the idea that you <br/>\ncan always quit if you don&#39;t feel like it one day. But I&#39;m just a novice, so <br/>\nfeel free to cheerfully disregard!<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\nLILY<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77610158,"authorName":"Bonni Sollars","from":"Bonni Sollars &lt;BSOLLARS@...&gt;","profile":"truuluvv","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] On Again / Off Again Interests","postDate":"1017906067","msgId":34079,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNDA0LjAyNDYyOC4tMTg0MzQ5LjguYnNvbGxhcnNAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34075,"nextInTopic":34088,"prevInTime":34078,"nextInTime":34080,"topicId":34071,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Shelly, I wonder if asking them why they don t want to go or why they do want to go would help.

He wanted to join the local homeschool band.  We <br/>\nsaid &quot;yes&quot;, he chose to play snare drums, we paid the band fee, <br/>\nrental fees, and as he asked for lessons, signed him up, and of <br/>\ncourse paid for the lessons.  After a few lessons, he wanted to quit <br/>\nlessons, so we let him.  After a couple of months of band, he wanted <br/>\nto quit, and so we let him.  After seeing his sister perform with the <br/>\nband at the winter concert he wanted to join again.  The director <br/>\nsaid &quot;no&quot; as he would be too far behind the &quot;beginner&quot; group, but <br/>\nsuggested that he rent drums again and practice on his own until the <br/>\nbeginner band starts again in September.  She suggested that if he <br/>\nwas beyond &quot;beginner&quot; by that time, he could play w/ the &quot;advanced&quot; <br/>\nband.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSoooooooo, what do we do?  Do we incur the expenses of drums all over <br/>\nagain?  When parents pay for lessons / equipment rental / buy <br/>\nuniforms etc., is it reasonable to require our children to practice?  <br/>\nMy unschooling gut says &quot;no&quot;, it needs to come from the child, <br/>\nwhether it&#39;s practice, or finishing a session / class that has been <br/>\npaid for.  But I must admit, I feel frustrated with the expense (we <br/>\nhave three children) and with the &quot;I want to do it - I don&#39;t like it <br/>\nanymore - I want to try it again&quot; roller coaster.  This has happened <br/>\nwith both of our older children in many different activities - <br/>\nsoccer, gymnastics, drama, bowling, guitar, violin, piano, science <br/>\nclasses, and the list goes on!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it isn&#39;t just trying an activity and deciding it&#39;s not their cup <br/>\nof tea - after quitting for a while, they will often want to rejoin <br/>\nthat same activity.  I&#39;ve noticed other recurring situations as <br/>\nwell.  My daughter loves singing & acting (she is ten), but if she is <br/>\nengrossed in an activity e.g. computer game, reading a book, playing <br/>\nbarbies, she will downright throw a tantrum about going to choir or <br/>\nacting class (which she begged to join - and often talks excitedly <br/>\nabout after class!).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what about the children who are along for the ride in the car as <br/>\none child attends their particular activity?  How much of this is <br/>\nreasonable or sane?  I want to honor and respect their moods, and <br/>\nsupport what they are interested in learning about, but... this feels <br/>\na bit indulgent for some reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate any and all suggestions  regarding this topic - <br/>\nespecially as to how unschoolers handle similar situations!<br/>\n<br/>\nShelly<br/>\nA mom who loves reading Holt, and is trying to put it into practice <br/>\ndespite various insecurities which flare up from time to time!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34280,"nextTopicId":34258}}
