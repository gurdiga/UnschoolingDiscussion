The courts will not keep the children away from their own <br/>\nfather. I have a friend whose husband is a drug addict - he&#39;s had his <br/>\npharmacist license removed, he&#39;s been in court-ordered rehab multiple <br/>\ntimes, the court KNOWS he is a drug addict - the court STILL gives him <br/>\nhalf-custody, over and over. He moved away - so now she has a court <br/>\norder to put her children on an airplane and send them to this man for <br/>\ndays and sometimes weeks at a time. Is that better? (Maybe it is for <br/>\nthe mom - but is it for the kids?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some other posters have mentioned healing your relationship with your<br/>\n&gt; husband.

Irene - only YOU can make the <br/>\nchoice to divorce your husband, but YOU don&#39;t get the choice of whether <br/>\nhe sees or even takes the children, that will be up to a judge.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou cannot get the children away from him through divorce. HE will <br/>\nstill be their father, and he&#39;ll get part or even full custody and <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be with him without you there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is abusing drugs or alcohol or beating the children or you - then <br/>\nyou may need to escape immediately. That might be a crisis. But in the <br/>\nabsence of an immediately crisis, it sounds like you&#39;ve truly done very <br/>\nlittle to work on your family - avoiding divorce and the consequent <br/>\nsplitting up the children between yourself and your husband would be <br/>\nvery worth putting in a lot of effort and energy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, Irene, if you&#39;re not able to find a way to live peacefully with <br/>\neach other, perhaps you&#39;ll have achieved some improved level of <br/>\ncommunication, at least, so that you&#39;ll have a wisp of a hope that you <br/>\ncan cooperate on raising the kids. Otherwise, you leaving him like this <br/>\nis very likely to mean he&#39;ll fight you tooth and nail for custody - and <br/>\nhe&#39;ll at least partially win, if not completely. Yelling at kids, <br/>\ncriticizing them, being mean to them - none of those are going to be <br/>\nheld against him in court - they are standard normal parenting in this <br/>\nculture. He&#39;d have to be physically abusing them a lot and you&#39;d have <br/>\nto have physical evidence of that and STILL a court could send him to a <br/>\nquickie anger management class and then give him access to the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; To sum up, I recommend you take your focus off homeschool and put it<br/>\n&gt; on learning about abusive relationships and abuse survival.

Perhaps it&#39;s because you<br/>\nhave been with him all your adult life and even before, but you do not<br/>\nseem to be aware that you deserve much better than this. You are<br/>\nentitled to a much better life. And your children deserve much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo sum up, I recommend you take your focus off homeschool and put it<br/>\non learning about abusive relationships and abuse survival. And start<br/>\nplanning your escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove and light, and best wishes, <br/>\nVesna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: a difficult problem","postDate":"1104079182","msgId":101747,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU1Ljk1MDM5ZjguMmYwMDQzNGVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":101746,"nextInTopic":101749,"prevInTime":101746,"nextInTime":101748,"topicId":101715,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/26/04 1:57:51 AM, crrbuddy@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-889600143\">In a message dated 12/26/04 1:57:51 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crrbuddy@...\">crrbuddy@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  Yet, isn&#39;t this the mentality that we&#39;ve strived so hard to <br/>\n<br/>\novercome in unschooling -- that is, the labeling that so often <br/>\n<br/>\naccompanies so-called &quot;dysfunctions&quot; of the times, liberally applied <br/>\n<br/>\nto a given person or situation based on orthodox beliefs?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we don&#39;t mention the second generation effects of alcoholism, then they <br/>\nwon&#39;t be there?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe effect of alcoholism on the relatives of alcoholics is not a &quot;so-called <br/>\n&#39;dysfunction&#39;.&quot;  It&#39;s a life-ruining, soul-sucking hole.<br/>\n<br/>\nADD is a so-called &quot;dysfunction.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-It&#39;s very <br/>\n<br/>\ndisheartening to me to see Irene reach out for help in the hopes of <br/>\n<br/>\nfinding a positive alternative to divorce, and end up with the <br/>\n<br/>\nconclusion that it&#39;s basically over. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou didn&#39;t get that from what I wrote.<br/>\nThere are ways for people to learn to detach from the effects of other <br/>\npeople&#39;s neglect and abuse, and al-Anon has been providing that free of charge for a <br/>\nlong time.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Sandra, that reminds me of your article on the benefits of holding <br/>\n<br/>\non to your &quot;treasures.&quot;  If you&#39;ve got the link handy, please share <br/>\n<br/>\nit again.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYour House as a Museum, I&#39;m guessing.

I&#39;ve let a lot of my oldies, but goodies, go in the <br/>\nattempt to achieve that almighty standard of &quot;clean&quot; -- regrets, I <br/>\nhave a few, but then again, too few to mention...  In my experience, <br/>\nthere&#39;s definitely much more to it than meets the eye.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love Marshall Rosenberg&#39;s approach to people and life in general <br/>\nin his practice of Nonviolent Communication (NVC) -- simply, that <br/>\nall people have the same basic needs, just different strategies of <br/>\nmeeting them (from spending time on non-domestic activities while <br/>\nthe dishes remain undone to cluttering up the underside of our bed <br/>\nwith others&#39; possessions and/or engaging in self-denial about the <br/>\nproblem.)  One of the strongest needs to be met, in NVC theory, is <br/>\nthe need to give to others.  That makes all the difference in the <br/>\nworld when it comes to sharing our lives with others on the planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith NVC, even the most &quot;dysfunctional&quot; personalities can come to <br/>\nagreeable terms with no labeling, no blaming, no threats or lawsuits <br/>\nnecessary.  No sermon intended, but this is also in line with the <br/>\npractice of Christian Science (CS), in which all people are held in <br/>\nthe same light and viewed with the same great potential for being a <br/>\npositive force in the world.  There are no throwaways, no incurable <br/>\ndis-eases, no hopelessly dysfunctional people, relationships, etc., <br/>\nin this faith and I&#39;m living proof of that! (Always happy to <br/>\nelaborate if anyone&#39;s interested, onlist or off.) <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the labels and assumptions are tossed aside, there are no more <br/>\nlimitations holding us back and the possibilities for improving our <br/>\nlife and wellbeing are endless.  I see the fear of continuing on <br/>\nwith a difficult situation, but have to agree with Sandra as one who <br/>\nhas came in to a broken home after-the-fact and lived the stepfamily <br/>\nlife while helping to raise my husband&#39;s and _our_ ex-wife&#39;s <br/>\nfirstborn for the past twenty years (and it doesn&#39;t end when they <br/>\ncome of age!) -- sympathetic courts and fair custodial arrangements <br/>\nare a fantasy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt all boils down to open communication and if that is a problem <br/>\nduring the marriage, it will more than likely go steadily downhill <br/>\nonce divorce papers are served!  If you think the kids are unhappy <br/>\nnow, wait till they have to split time between two homes, especially <br/>\nif their relationship with their father is already strained to the <br/>\nmax.  Gotta be a better way, and I truly believe there is based on <br/>\nwhat I&#39;ve heard of Irene&#39;s situation and our family&#39;s experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur oldest child had a decent, loving relationship with both parents <br/>\nand step-parents, and still remembers his childhood as a tug-o-war <br/>\nbecause of our essential lack of trust and communication with one <br/>\nanother.  His siblings watched what Marshall calls the &quot;jackal show&quot; <br/>\nfrom the sidelines and tried to live their own lives around it and <br/>\ndespite our seemingly futile efforts to make it work.  It affected <br/>\neveryone involved to one degree or another.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that their brother&#39;s begun a family of his own and is already <br/>\nstruggling with separation issues, no one here has any doubts <br/>\nwhatsoever that we are all in sore need of something, if not more <br/>\neffective communication skills, as the various &quot;dysfunctional&quot; <br/>\naspects of our relationships seem to have been passed down once & <br/>\nagain.  I can&#39;t help but wonder why the most &quot;functional&quot; parts went <br/>\nby the wayside... there have been plenty of good times, after all.  <br/>\nI&#39;m counting on CS and NVC to get us through this one intact!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps put the &quot;dysfunctional&quot; label in a new perspective <br/>\nand encourages others to think in more unlimited terms when advising <br/>\nIrene on matters of the heart.  &#39;Tis a much happier way to celebrate <br/>\nthe New Year with a resolution to find a way to meet others&#39; needs <br/>\nwithout compromising our own.

The reason is that when I first read the plea my thought was<br/>\nthat it is not really homeschooling that is at the heart of this problem but<br/>\nsomething else - the dreadful state of Irene and her husband&#39;s relationship.<br/>\nNow Irene has posted a follow up telling us how counseling has been tried,<br/>\nand of the apparently growing schism in life philosophies that has continued<br/>\nto plague their marriage.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I have been battling him since we first got married 11 years ago.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is certainly before any homeschooling began.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy first marriage when I was 20 was similar to this, except thankfully<br/>\nwithout any kids. He was verbally abusive in a similarly put-down way, and I<br/>\nfelt very victimized, downtrodden and trapped at the time. We too fought<br/>\nostensibly about housekeeping and money, or its lack. Also he was a terrific<br/>\nactor and able to charm people at least temporarily. Now, 20 years later, I<br/>\ncan see my part in exacerbating/enabling his negative qualities, and how my<br/>\ncontrolling nature led me to stay in the relationship for a lot longer than<br/>\nwas either healthy or necessary. Trying to change or fix him was futile in<br/>\nthe end.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too had fears that he would vindictively seek revenge, although without<br/>\nchildren to worry about, I&#39;m sure Irene&#39;s are much greater than mine were.<br/>\nHe did poison my dog at one point. Eventually I found a way to leave the<br/>\nrelationship, which was not the same way I would act to end such a situation<br/>\ntoday. Today, or more accurately with my current self-knowledge, I would be<br/>\nmore direct, and act sooner.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy fears about him were not entirely groundless, but certainly not realized<br/>\nto the extent that I worried. I was able to scare him off when he came<br/>\naround drunkenly with a buddy and threw rocks at my wall, with one call to<br/>\nthe police in the middle of the night, and he only broke into my new<br/>\napartment once when I was out, in order to leave a nasty note for me to<br/>\nfind. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone else wrote about depression. My ex had a problem with some kind of<br/>\nmental illness or emotional instability or whatever it would be called<br/>\nclinically. He was a compulsive liar, and became a thief. I only realized<br/>\nthe extent of his problem after we split up, although the clues were always<br/>\nthere. For example he had spent a long time in psychiatric counseling as a<br/>\nyoungster (which I know many people do and get a lot of help from - it is<br/>\njust part of the bigger picture). In his case I think it taught him how to<br/>\nlie more effectively. His parents had a huge padlock on the door to their<br/>\nbedroom, which they continued to lock whenever they left him alone in the<br/>\nhouse, maintaining the custom they had from his childhood even when he was<br/>\ngrown.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter our marriage ended, I attempted to continue with a business<br/>\nrelationship; that calmly civilized behavior lasted only a couple of months.<br/>\nHe had moved into a shared apartment. His roommates, and himself, were<br/>\nhaving electronics &quot;stolen&quot; from the house. The lot turned up under his bed,<br/>\nwhere he continued to express astonishment and denial. I happened to be<br/>\nthere when this occurred, and at one point he broke down and begged for<br/>\npsychological help. His friends, from childhood, did try to help him at that<br/>\ntime, but when the actual time to go see someone came, he backed out<br/>\nsomehow. He had backed out from marriage counseling with me also.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was all more background than I intended to write. It is just that my<br/>\nthoughts on this are inevitably colored by my horrible experience of living<br/>\nwith a verbal abuser. Like other kinds of abuse, it doesn&#39;t burst full blown<br/>\nlike Athena from Zeus&#39;s forehead. It takes a while to get the level of being<br/>\nconstant, and it takes a while for the recipient to be worn down to the<br/>\npoint of starting to believe that it is deserved or justifiable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIrene talks of an eleven year long battle. Maybe her husband also feels<br/>\ntrapped, and has transferred his expressions of resentment from herself to<br/>\nthe children. Maybe Irene is a controlling personality, as I was, and makes<br/>\ndecisions without consensus, and has unwittingly created a situation where<br/>\nthe only outlet her dh feels he has is to criticize the children.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe, like my ex, he is an abusive asshole, with mental and emotional<br/>\nproblems that she will not be able to fix not matter how hard she and a<br/>\nmarriage counselor try.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost likely the real situation is much more complex than these simple<br/>\ndistillations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know that the children shouldn&#39;t have to live with and bear the burden<br/>\nof a bad relationship between the parents. <br/>\n<br/>\nPam suggested the reading about the legalities of the situation. There have<br/>\nbeen suggestions ranging from visiting doctors to reading self-help books. I<br/>\nthink that getting more (and better) professional help may be a better<br/>\nalternative than ending the marriage - provided the husband is willing, and<br/>\ngetting to the root of these surface issues (it ain&#39;t really cleaning) and<br/>\nlearning how to communicate needs without abusiveness are the goals. Does he<br/>\neven realize that Irene is having these trapped feelings? OTOH is he wanting<br/>\nout but doesn&#39;t know how to initiate it? <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever someone brought up the issue of whether it is better to live with a<br/>\ncritical father or not have one&#39;s father in the home. Is it really better to<br/>\nlive each day with someone who makes you feel lousy about yourself, whose<br/>\npresence you must struggle to ignore, who is creating the likelihood of you<br/>\nre-creating this abusive lifestyle for your future adult relationships? Is<br/>\nit better for a mother to model living in fear, sticking out and enduring<br/>\nabuse for her dd&#39;s? Is it better for ds to learn that this is how men treat<br/>\ntheir wives? All this negative stuff gets absorbed no matter how much the<br/>\nkids &quot;ignore&quot; what is being said to them. Neither Irene&#39;s nor her husband&#39;s<br/>\ndemons should be the children&#39;s responsibility to deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI stayed longer than I should have in my abusive marriage and it took me<br/>\nyears to restore my self esteem, and even longer to take responsibility for<br/>\nmy part in our disagreements (ie screaming arguments). I had learnt from my<br/>\nown painful childhood that love feels like pain, loss, abandonment and<br/>\ncriticism. It took a lot of work as an adult to get to a place where I have<br/>\nbeen able to welcome love that feels like kindness, generosity, fulfillment<br/>\nand support. Jayn will not have to spend the years I did discovering what<br/>\nreal unconditional love feels like, or have to guess how two adults who love<br/>\neach other behave towards each other, despite our various shortcomings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI truly hoped that this would turn out to be only about a disagreement<br/>\nregarding homeschooling. I truly hope this turns out to be about a couple of<br/>\nadults who need some help learning to communicate better. I don&#39;t usually<br/>\nagree with Dr. Phil, but his idea that it takes 100 &quot;atta boys&quot; to<br/>\ncompensate for one nasty criticism, is useful to remember in terms of the<br/>\nsense of urgency about seeking help or change, to make life better for the<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with it, Irene. Maybe seek some counseling or group therapy (as<br/>\nothers have noted) such as for adult survivors of child abuse, for yourself<br/>\nno matter what happens with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Or rather let&#39;s <br/>\n  say it&#39;s Irene (which is my sister&#39;s name, but this is not my sister, and I <br/>\n  haven&#39;t noticed another Irene on the list so if there&#39;s an Irene reading, sorry <br/>\n  to have borrowed a too-familiar name).    <br/>\n<br/>\n  So &quot;Irene&quot; writes the following.   Can any of you with even the slightest <br/>\n  idea or suggestion please post it here?  It&#39;s nearly Christmas and a little peace <br/>\n  and encouragement can go a long way.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks!<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  --<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi. . . I have 3 kids ages 12, 10, and 9. Girl, boy, girl, is their <br/>\n  birthorder. I have been &quot;homeschooling&quot; for 3 years now and just started unschooling <br/>\n  about 4 months ago, (which I love and so do they, its simply wonderful). <br/>\n<br/>\n  My problem lies not with my kids or myself but with my husband. To be frank <br/>\n  he is down right abusive, verbally, not physically. He hates me homeschooling. <br/>\n  I mean he loathes me homeschooling. If the kids dont answer his questions <br/>\n  right or if they do something silly by accident, he calls them &quot;homeschools&quot;. He <br/>\n  tells me and them that they wont make it later in life,  that they will be <br/>\n  flipping burgers and asking want fries with that? He says you just wait and see <br/>\n  they wont make anything of themselves and I am not going to support them the <br/>\n  rest of their lives!! I can only intervene so much, I am only one person. I need <br/>\n  two more people sheltering the kids from him. They have learned to ignore it <br/>\n  and to be honest they have lost all respect for him.  I know though that it <br/>\n  still hurts them to hear their dad think so poorly of them. It is affecting my <br/>\n  oldest daughters self esteem.  They wont do what he asks. Honestly they just <br/>\n  fllat out ignore him because they know it doesnt matter how they do the job, its <br/>\n  not going to be good enough and then he will just make fun of them. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I have contemplated leaving him on several occasions but I am terrified that <br/>\n  if I did I would have a court order telling me I have to put them back in <br/>\n  school.  Its just not worth the risk to me, and I know my husband, he is very <br/>\n  vendictive and he would try and take them from me.  I dont want my kids going <br/>\n  through a battle like that. So I stay and fight, and fight, and fight.....its <br/>\n  becoming really difficult for me to continue. I have been battling him since we <br/>\n  first got married 11 years ago.  We married young because we had our first child <br/>\n  out of wedlock and I was determined to marry him no matter the consequences. <br/>\n  I was stuborn, controling and far to young to<br/>\n  make such a big decision. I was 18 and he was 17, his mother had to sign <br/>\n  because he was not legal yet.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway,  no matter the struggle I will fight him for my kids who  cant fight <br/>\n  him themselves. I just dont know how to handle the situation anymore. It is <br/>\n  getting worse, he doesnt hold his tongue at all anymore. I am at a loss. I want <br/>\n  to leave but I am terrified of loosing my kids. Since everything he does is <br/>\n  strickly verbal then there are no bruses, I cant prove it. I could video tape <br/>\n  him but it would have to be with his knowledge or the evidence would be <br/>\n  unuseable. If I ever did get permission to  videotape him, he would put on an act that <br/>\n  no judge would fight. I feel trapped and really need some help.  . . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thank you for reading this and I look forward to hearing from you...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I have tried counseling, which didn&#39;t work. At the time we were going to get a divorce and this was the last resort. 6 years ago, if I am not mistaken, we went to counseling to iron out some issues that had festered so long he and I both were resentful and would have killed each-other if we didn&#39;t do something. While we were in counseling the issue at hand was because I did not clean enough for him. It was a rather trivial reason to want to leave someone but I understood. He and I both came from an abusive family which would explain the early pregnancy. So with that said it is obvious why we found ourselves in counseling after 5 years of marriage. We left counseling with little to go on. I was told if I just cleaned more then he would be happier. I was incredibly mad and was totally against it at the time. It just seemed ridiculous that a cluttered house would upset someone to the point of cursing, yelling, and tossing<br/>\n things about. So for the next year I fought the suggested advice and eventually I couldn&#39;t take it anymore so I started cleaning. I got to a point that it was no longer worth the fight. To this day the house still is not clean enough. Now I am sure you all are wondering what do I mean by clean. How clean would the house have to be before he was satisfied? House beautiful, William Sonoma, and better homes and gardens are what comes to mind. Perfect homes with no dust, no clutter, nice furniture with no rips or stains, carpets so lush that you could sleep on them. These are all things that he values. These are all things that we do not have, nor could we really ever afford. The other issue is money. We never have any. Kinda funny really because who does. The bills are paid and we have food to eat and clothes to wear and that is good enough for me. He however wants thousands of dollars left over at the end of the month so he can go live a luxurious life style like the life styles of<br/>\n the rich and famous. These are all things that I have no interest in. I mean sure they would be nice, but thats not realistic. I suppose I should tell you that his father and grandmother on his moms side are both millionaires, so this is where he gets it. I could go on and on but I don&#39;t see how this will be of any good. As far as the kids go, we did put them back in school and when the teachers wouldn&#39;t let my daughter go to the bathroom and she defecated on herself, and the teacher of my son made him miss recess everyday because his work wasn&#39;t done, or because he missed to many, I had enough and took them out again swearing never to put them through it as long as I was alive. You see its not that I have not tried the things suggested its just that they haven&#39;t worked. I suppose the only thing that I have yet to do is go to a lawyer. Divorce is something that I was told I could never do. I would go to hell, God would reject me, and it is ingrained in my mind so deeply that it<br/>\n scared me. I have come to realize of course that I wont go to Hell and I can make a choice like that because I am a free person. I am still scared but believe I have no other choice.

If anybody is in <br/>\nSouthern California and needs one, I can help out with a referral. <br/>\nOther locations - I don&#39;t have information, but asking in local and <br/>\nstate homeschooling circles might turn up somebody. I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nsurprised.<br/>\n<br/>\nSympathetic courts are another matter - the usual procedure in custody <br/>\nfights is to leave the children in their status quo - that&#39;s the <br/>\ndefault, most often. I know that because one recommendation I&#39;ve heard <br/>\nmade by an attorney I know, who is a homeschooling parent, is that when <br/>\na divorce is happening, that it is a bad idea to TEMPORARILY put the <br/>\nkids in school and then try to get a judge to allow them to return to <br/>\nhomeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn California, people have had somewhat good luck with putting the kids <br/>\nin a charter school independent study program at the first sign that <br/>\ndivorce could be a possibility. People have won the right to keep their <br/>\nkids in those programs even when the other spouse is asking the judge <br/>\nto order them into public school. There are charter programs that are <br/>\nhomeschooling programs - with varying degrees of reporting requirements <br/>\n- and there are charters that even support unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who won the right to continue to homeschool her son - <br/>\nit was a battle against her ex. It got to the point of going to court <br/>\n(no out of court agreement, no mediators, etc.) and she presented a <br/>\n&quot;case for homeschooling that particular child&quot; and she won --- she says <br/>\nthat one of the things that MOST impressed the judge was a handful of <br/>\nphotographs that she presented as evidence of his social interaction - <br/>\nthey were pictures of our homeschool group - and the one the judge <br/>\nseemed surprised and impressed by was one of all the kids, all ages, <br/>\nplaying together at a Halloween party. She was very very glad she&#39;d <br/>\ntaken the photos, felt that made all the difference. And, in fact, the <br/>\njudge said such nice things about how she&#39;d done such a good job <br/>\nhomeschooling him, that  the judge asked the ex if he wouldn&#39;t do <br/>\nbetter by his son if he&#39;d help, not be a hindrance, in his education <br/>\nand the ex agreed with the judge, that it would be better for his son. <br/>\nA completely unexpected turn of events. She said her ex listened to the <br/>\nevidence for homeschooling presented to the judge - even though he&#39;d <br/>\nnever even really listened to her before when she tried to talk to him <br/>\nabout it.

Let&#39;s even assume that he would succeed in<br/>\nthat pursuit.<br/>\n<br/>\n I don&#39;t know a great deal about divorce law, but it seems likely to me that<br/>\nIrene will have little difficulty in putting together a case for custody.<br/>\nIn speaking with a lawyer, she might even discover a court that&#39;s friendly<br/>\nto homeschoolers - not terribly likely, I realize, but also not impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nToo, if she can demonstrate that her kids are progressing with the<br/>\neducational exuberance typical of unschoolers, she should have little<br/>\ntrouble convincing a judge to vacate any potential order requiring her kids<br/>\nto attend school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then, the question breaks down to a relatively simple one: will the kids<br/>\nsuffer more harm from being in an environment where one of their parents is<br/>\nhighly abusive of their learning, or from spending a short time in public<br/>\nschools while the legal difficulties are ironed out?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome home- and un-schoolers I know spend a semester or two in public schools<br/>\njust to gain the perspective of seeing what it&#39;s like - could Irene approach<br/>\nit from that angle?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother train of thought worth chasing down is whether or not this marriage<br/>\ncan be saved, and whether Irene&#39;s husband could perhaps be persuaded to be<br/>\nmore respectful of his children, never mind their educational choices.  Has<br/>\nshe tried to pursue marital counseling with him? <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, it&#39;s worth weighing whether the damage done by an abusive father is<br/>\noutweighed by the damage done by the lack of a father in the picture.<br/>\nNeither is a good situation, but one may be worse than the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly feel for Irene here - my wife and I were married at 19, and were<br/>\nparents before we turned 20.  We&#39;ve had to work very hard at times on our<br/>\nrelationship, but it&#39;s been very well worthwhile, in the long run.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink that things ever got as bad for us as they have for Irene, but there<br/>\nwere certainly some pretty rough patches.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess my suggestions would break down to:<br/>\n1. Irene should contact a marital counselor and see what ideas (s)he may<br/>\nhave for her for trying to salvage the relationship with her husband, or at<br/>\nleast get him to stop being abusive to the kids.<br/>\n2. She should contact a divorce lawyer and get a clear read on the legal<br/>\npotentials in her situation, and not just assume the doomsday scenario she&#39;s<br/>\nlaid out will inevitably come to pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo, I certainly wish her the very best as she tries to navigate this very<br/>\ndifficult challenge.  Unschooling can be tough enough to manage with the<br/>\nauthorities, friends and neighbors&#39; snarky comments, but I cannot imagine my<br/>\nwife being able to do it with my kids if I weren&#39;t on board with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of wishes, &quot;Irene.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lars D.

I have 3 kids ages 12, 10, and 9. Girl, boy, girl, is their<br/>\nbirthorder. I have been &quot;homeschooling&quot; for 3 years now and just started<br/>\nunschooling about 4 months ago, (which I love and so do they, its simply<br/>\nwonderful). <br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem lies not with my kids or myself but with my husband. To be frank<br/>\nhe is down right abusive, verbally, not physically. He hates me<br/>\nhomeschooling. <br/>\nI mean he loathes me homeschooling. If the kids dont answer his questions<br/>\nright or if they do something silly by accident, he calls them<br/>\n&quot;homeschools&quot;. He tells me and them that they wont make it later in life,<br/>\nthat they will be flipping burgers and asking want fries with that? He says<br/>\nyou just wait and see they wont make anything of themselves and I am not<br/>\ngoing to support them the rest of their lives!! I can only intervene so<br/>\nmuch, I am only one person. I need two more people sheltering the kids from<br/>\nhim. They have learned to ignore it and to be honest they have lost all<br/>\nrespect for him.  I know though that it still hurts them to hear their dad<br/>\nthink so poorly of them. It is affecting my oldest daughters self esteem.<br/>\nThey wont do what he asks. Honestly they just fllat out ignore him because<br/>\nthey know it doesnt matter how they do the job, its not going to be good<br/>\nenough and then he will just make fun of them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have contemplated leaving him on several occasions but I am terrified that<br/>\nif I did I would have a court order telling me I have to put them back in<br/>\nschool.  Its just not worth the risk to me, and I know my husband, he is<br/>\nvery vendictive and he would try and take them from me.  I dont want my kids<br/>\ngoing through a battle like that. So I stay and fight, and fight, and<br/>\nfight.....its becoming really difficult for me to continue. I have been<br/>\nbattling him since we first got married 11 years ago.  We married young<br/>\nbecause we had our first child out of wedlock and I was determined to marry<br/>\nhim no matter the consequences. <br/>\nI was stuborn, controling and far to young to  make such a big decision. I<br/>\nwas 18 and he was 17, his mother had to sign <br/>\nbecause he was not legal yet.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway,  no matter the struggle I will fight him for my kids who  cant fight<br/>\nhim themselves. I just dont know how to handle the situation anymore. It is<br/>\ngetting worse, he doesnt hold his tongue at all anymore. I am at a loss. I<br/>\nwant to leave but I am terrified of loosing my kids. Since everything he<br/>\ndoes is strickly verbal then there are no bruses, I cant prove it. I could<br/>\nvideo tape him but it would have to be with his knowledge or the evidence<br/>\nwould be unuseable. If I ever did get permission to  videotape him, he would<br/>\nput on an act that no judge would fight. I feel trapped and really need some<br/>\nhelp.  . . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n Thank you for reading this and I look forward to hearing from you...<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------ Yahoo!
