I hate myself for that....I was completely uninformed. Fortunately they<br/>\nhave never shown signs of a bad reaction. With my 3rd, I started her on the<br/>\nregular schedule and then learned all kinds of awful truths about the shots<br/>\n(again, fortunately not with her...through reading). My youngest has never<br/>\nbeen vaccinated with anything as of yet and she is 2-1/2.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone else find it strange that chickenpox is now considered a<br/>\nlife-threatening disease which must be avoided at all costs? Remember just<br/>\n10 years ago....a child would get chickenpox and other mothers would bring<br/>\ntheir children over purposely to catch it and get it over with? Remember the<br/>\nbook &quot;Itchy Scritchy Chickenpox&quot;?  It was a joke....everyone got it sooner<br/>\nor later, some were really sick with it and some kids didn&#39;t mind at all.<br/>\nWhen one of my kids caught it 7 years ago, the pediatrician&#39;s office was<br/>\nmore concerned that I was missing an appt for more vaccinations than the<br/>\nfact that my just turned one year old was miserably sick. They didn&#39;t even<br/>\noffer any suggestions on making her more comfortable. Now there are<br/>\ncommercials with toys crying for the children who didn&#39;t get vaccinated for<br/>\nchickenpox and died. Strange how cavalier the medical community was about it<br/>\nbefore the vaccine, isn&#39;t it? Now it&#39;s life-threatening.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the MMR was first introduced in Japan (not too long ago), autism for<br/>\nthe vaccinated age group went up 500%. But here they only want to spread out<br/>\nthe shots, not discontinue them...and they think spreading them out is<br/>\nradical.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should have known vaccinations were a bad idea....I got hard measles from<br/>\nthe shot when I was 6. I still have the scar. If I could do it over again, I<br/>\nwould vaccinate only for tetanus.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Valerie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13385,"nextTopicId":13390}}
