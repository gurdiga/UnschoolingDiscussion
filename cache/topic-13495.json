The main outrage has been based on the fact that many people were in the scouts, involved with the scouts or supporting the scouts (like corporations, on a large scale) who are now either among the excluded group or friends/family/supporters of the excluded group.  Put yourself (generic you, not anyone in particilar) in that situation, and how would you feel?  What would you think about the organization in which you invested so much time, funds and interest?<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Valerie","from":"&quot;Valerie&quot; &lt;valeries@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"FxXBSlp5uAwH2Py6aNg0zGC8fqeb3yjdBnAAu78i9zB5m9xEh-TfgGnXU2GGJpWjdhZZeLH9wltrYLyKiRfr-gujptnNHQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"re: scouts","postDate":"970174722","msgId":13495,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDMwMWMwMjk4ZSRlMjE5YTQ0MCQ5NzhlM2VhNkB3dnVzLm9yZz4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13499,"prevInTime":13494,"nextInTime":13496,"topicId":13495,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is something I ve never understood....How did this ever become an issue?

Granted I was never a boy scout so I don&#39;t know, but I have a hard<br/>\ntime envisioning this. Is there a badge for having sex with a girl for the<br/>\nfirst time? Is that in the handbook? Or is it simply because it is a<br/>\nChristian organization, therefore any rule in the Bible must be followed by<br/>\neveryone? If that is the case, why pick on homosexuality? You&#39;ll notice it&#39;s<br/>\nnot in the 10 Commandments. There&#39;s barely a mention of it at all (I can<br/>\nonly think of 3 times).  Most important to me, Jesus Christ himself never<br/>\nsaid a word about it. He spoke of love, compassion and The Golden Rule. Why<br/>\nhas this &quot;sin&quot; become more important than things like resting on the Sabbath<br/>\n(which _is_ in the 10 Commandments)?  If they are going to be so nosy about<br/>\nwhat their members and leaders do you&#39;d think they&#39;d care if someone had an<br/>\naffair, or coveted their neighbor&#39;s car, or ever lied.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Valerie, who doesn&#39;t mind being flamed</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42962,"nextTopicId":42968}}
