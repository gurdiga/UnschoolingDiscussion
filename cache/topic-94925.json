There are reduced rates for registering<br/>\nbefore June 15th and cost includes camping and meals. I&#39;ve been going to<br/>\nPrimitive Skills Gatherings since my children were infants and every single<br/>\none has been wonderful--an incredible learning experience, community sharing<br/>\nand safe, fun family event! This year Jean-Claude and I will be facilitating<br/>\nseveral workshops again, including Nonviolent Communication, natural and compassionate parenting, <br/>\nand &quot;growing without schooling&quot;, no-till natural farming and paleolithic eating.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can get details and see the whole program (there are usually last minute<br/>\nadditions and extras as well) here:<br/>\nwww.firemaker.org<br/>\nI pasted an excerpt below. Every year there are a few homeschoolers at these<br/>\nevents--I&#39;d love to meet more of you there!<br/>\n<br/>\nwarmly,<br/>\ningrid<br/>\nSaltspring Island<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Every summer, the Firemaker Primitive Skills Society hosts Firemaker, a<br/>\ngathering for those interested in natural and primitive skills as well as<br/>\nthe underlying philosophy of those skills and ways of life. At our<br/>\ngatherings, we invite instructors to share their skills and love for<br/>\nlow-tech or no-tech ways of living and enjoying the outdoors. Click here for<br/>\nthis year&#39;s program and registration info.<br/>\n<br/>\nFiremaker gatherings are about more than just primitive skills; they&#39;re also<br/>\nabout friendship, fun, and community. Every evening there is singing,<br/>\ndrumming, and story telling around the campfire. Group camping, shared meals<br/>\nand time to chat with instructors or to share the day&#39;s experiences with new<br/>\nor old friends add to the feeling of community, There&#39;s also plenty of room<br/>\nfor solitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nFiremaker is an excellent opportunity to:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Learn to be more aware of the Natural world<br/>\n-Make useful and beautiful objects with our hands.<br/>\n-Know what, when, and how to gather and use what we gather<br/>\n-Develop competence for survival and wilderness living.<br/>\n-Connect with each other and our children in a beautiful natural setting.<br/>\n-Make music and have fun together.<br/>\n-Understand the unity of physical and spiritual.&quot;<br/>\nwww.firemaker.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94920,"nextTopicId":94934}}
