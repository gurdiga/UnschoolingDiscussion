LOL. We&#39;re not morning people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyhow, I&#39;m finding myself looking at catalogs, Internet sites, garage sales,<br/>\n&gt; wondering what to buy.  Because we have always been a school at home family,<br/>\n&gt; we don&#39;t have many games other than the regular &quot;milton bradley type&quot; board<br/>\n&gt; games.  I don&#39;t want to blow a bunch of money on stuff that will just sit.  I<br/>\n&gt; also don&#39;t want to fall into buying a bunch of curriculum.  I REALLY want to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>do<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; this right.  If you were just beginning to unschool, knowing what you know<br/>\n&gt; now, and you had some money to spend of fun, cool stuff, what would you buy?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here we have a weekly allowance for every man, woman and child to spend on<br/>\nwhat they like; when we&#39;re &quot;in funds&quot; ;) we buy other stuff (we just<br/>\nfinished a big job that will allow us to buy a computer upgrade and a new<br/>\nTV, for example). I would hand over the money to the kids and let them pick<br/>\nnow or save for later, their choice. Keep a portion of it yourself and buy<br/>\nwhat interests YOU (whether that&#39;s gardening supplies or cooking stuff or<br/>\nfancy mice or novels about regency England) and, if you&#39;re feeling<br/>\nagreeable, share those interests with any interested child, and of course<br/>\ntake a keen interest in what they use their time and money on, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe money doesn&#39;t have to be spent now. &quot;Back to school&quot; time is only for<br/>\nschools, you don&#39;t have to figure out a year&#39;s worth of interests and fun by<br/>\nSept. 1.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, what would you do for a while?  Would you take a good while and see<br/>\n&gt; what everyone wants to do?  Am I getting ready to be pulled like taffy into 6<br/>\n&gt; different directions? :oO<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, and possibly yes. ;) Think of fun things you&#39;d like to do and places<br/>\nyou&#39;d like to go and invite them. They&#39;ll come up with their own, too, and<br/>\nsoon you&#39;ll all be so busy juggling schedules you&#39;ll wonder what you were<br/>\nworried about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2 of my boys can barely read, and it means a LOT to them to be able to.  If<br/>\n&gt; learning to read is what a child REALLY wants, would any of you get some sort<br/>\n&gt; of aides or maybe computer games to help them with this?  Would you just read<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; lot to them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d offer to help them in any way they wanted help. If you do start &quot;a<br/>\ncurriculum&quot; with them to read, make sure you make it clear that it&#39;s their<br/>\nchoice whether to start or continue, their choice when they want to end it,<br/>\nand that if the curriculum doesn&#39;t happen to work out for them that it is<br/>\nITS fault, not theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing my 8 year old enjoy these days is reading books with me -- she<br/>\nreads the words she knows and I read the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78250,"nextTopicId":78275}}
