I guess it&#39;s a subject that never <br/>\ngoes away!<br/>\n<br/>\nI still think the basic problem is too much stuff! Stash half of those toys <br/>\nin boxes in the garage and see how long before anyone asks for them!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy secret weapon, though, is that every two weeks I have a team of <br/>\nhousekeepers in. Yes, I hire housekeepers. I could pay a sitter and clean <br/>\nthe house myself, but I personally loathe cleaning, so I&#39;d rather pay the <br/>\nhousekeepers and take the kids to the park. Admittedly, this costs money, <br/>\nbut we think it&#39;s worth it. This way we know that the basics -- bathroom, <br/>\nclean sheets, kitchen -- get done every two weeks (yes, our standards are <br/>\nrock-bottom!) and also, the night before they come, we all pitch in and <br/>\norganize the clutter. The cry is, &quot;put your stuff away or the &#39;ladies&#39; will <br/>\nand then you&#39;ll never find it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"jgaYKxlPmaJziY27-t2j50yLuet1MOr862M5DfrbbO3rKYeUCETQVmGKQhOubb8izBgyLC6UbQxLdVHxfRLBu197T_RQIIL9LjL58zWZo7GzxF_Zzg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] fed up","postDate":"963963013","msgId":11325,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5NzRGNjk1LjI1ODcuODhDRjcyQGxvY2FsaG9zdD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDYxLjU3OTAzZDMuMjZhNWU3MGJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11307,"nextInTopic":11337,"prevInTime":11324,"nextInTime":11326,"topicId":11307,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"yeah, i ve been thinking about this.  i think they d do more for a helper than for me, sad isn t it.  but i mentioned it to dh tongiht and he said that they","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-160419658\">yeah, i&#39;ve been thinking about this.  i think they&#39;d do more for a <br/>\nhelper than for me, sad isn&#39;t it.  but i mentioned it to dh tongiht and <br/>\nhe said that they didn&#39;t do too bad last night.  as if i was <br/>\nchallenging his domain or something....<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 18 Jul 2000, at 12:59, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NumoAstro@...\">NumoAstro@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy:\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\nJust another thought, I have a mother&#39;s helper who <br/>\ncomes twice a week, she&#39;s \u000f<br/>\n15 years old and plays with the kids while I work or <br/>\nclean up or cook dinner \u000f<br/>\nor whatever.\u000e She is great with them and they love <br/>\nher.\u000e This could be \u000f<br/>\nanother way to go.\u000e I actually pay her $4 an hour which <br/>\nmy best friend says \u000f<br/>\nis too much, but I want to keep her and know that <br/>\nshe&#39;ll be there when I need \u000f<br/>\nher.\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\nDawn F </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NumoAstro@aol.com","from":"NumoAstro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"_MLEMut50vI3dUAbqem4JOSVmNOtrK4BQvJeInSP29VsslTJcmYMgnO-0DXY5_M2b9965uTw0QQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"fed up","postDate":"963939595","msgId":11307,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYxLjU3OTAzZDMuMjZhNWU3MGJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11325,"prevInTime":11306,"nextInTime":11308,"topicId":11307,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Tracy: Just another thought, I have a mother s helper who comes twice a week, she s 15 years old and plays with the kids while I work or clean up or cook","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-560775927\">Tracy:<br/>\n<br/>\nJust another thought, I have a mother&#39;s helper who comes twice a week, she&#39;s <br/>\n15 years old and plays with the kids while I work or clean up or cook dinner <br/>\nor whatever.
