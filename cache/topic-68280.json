He was a great guy <br/>\n </span></blockquote>with a great <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; soul but was forever torn because of his childhood.  He died in <br/>\n </span></blockquote>December of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &#39;01 of a heroin overdose.  The last time I saw him, a couple of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>days before <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he died, he told me no one loved him because we (the family at <br/>\n </span></blockquote>large) <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wouldn&#39;t help him.  He had been in a car accident and just received <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; $10,000 settlement.

Why <br/>\n </span></blockquote>mom was <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; making *him* make the rules.  He was only 13!  It wasn&#39;t his job!  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>He was <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; failing a class in school and that was her reason for sending him <br/>\n </span></blockquote>in for the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; last time.  He moved in with my great grandparents but I guess the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>damamge <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; was done.  He never recovered from everything that had happened.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>He was 25 <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; when he died.  NOW, my mother is feeling the guilt.  She lost her <br/>\n </span></blockquote>job so we <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; moved in and took over payments.  We found out a few days ago that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>she <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wasn&#39;t making the payments we were giving her and the house is in <br/>\n&gt; foreclosure, so we are ridding ourselves of the relationship and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>buying a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; new house.  I talked to her the other day (she lives with my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>grandparents <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; now) and told her how much it hurt me that she would do this to my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>family.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Especially my children.  Her response was, &quot;I know!  I&#39;m losing <br/>\n </span></blockquote>everything I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; have!  Don&#39;t you know I am miserably depressed because I won&#39;t have <br/>\n </span></blockquote>anything <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; now?&quot;   She still doesn&#39;t get it.  It&#39;s all about her.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmmm, here I go again, seriously side-tracking.  Basically, my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>point is that <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; if I were in your shoes, I&#39;d do everything in my power to help my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>neice.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What happened to her baby?  To me, it doesn&#39;t sound like this poor <br/>\n </span></blockquote>girl has <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; what she needs at home.  Perhaps the family could rally together to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>help <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; her?  I think showing this article would be of great help.

I was put in solitary because I threw such a fit and begged <br/>\nmy family to get me out.  No one listened to me.  That damn place had my <br/>\nentire family convinced I was a horrible kid.  NOW they tell me they wished <br/>\nthey would have done something to help me.  My mom bounced us aound from <br/>\nfamily member to facility without a bat of an eye.  I think the worst part <br/>\nof it now is that she acts like she doesn&#39;t remember it.  She&#39;s apologized <br/>\nprofusely for being a bad mom, in general, but ignores or changes the <br/>\nconversation when those days come up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still affected by those experiences.  In many ways, it&#39;s good.  I <br/>\nbecame a mother at 16, but was hell bent on being the best mother I could <br/>\npossibly be.  I&#39;m very proud of what I have accomplished in the past 15 <br/>\nyears, despite all the &#39;proof&#39; that children, such as myself, end up <br/>\nrepeating the cycle.  I didn&#39;t!<br/>\n<br/>\nSadly, my brother wasn&#39;t as fortunate.  He lived his life a shadow of my <br/>\nmother&#39;s.  Irresponsible, depressed and lonely.  His whole life was focused <br/>\non himself.  He has a beautiful son but never quite got himself together <br/>\nenough to be the father he could have been.  He was a great guy with a great <br/>\nsoul but was forever torn because of his childhood.  He died in December of <br/>\n&#39;01 of a heroin overdose.  The last time I saw him, a couple of days before <br/>\nhe died, he told me no one loved him because we (the family at large) <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t help him.  He had been in a car accident and just received a <br/>\n$10,000 settlement.  By day 4, all but $500 dollars was gone, but he didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave the money to get an apartment.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months ago, I found letters my family sent me while I was in the <br/>\nhospital.  My brother had written me a letter, asking me to help him make <br/>\nrules so mom wouldn&#39;t make him go back into the hospital again.  (I&#39;d been <br/>\nin 4 times, plus time spent in a children&#39;s home, and he&#39;d been in twice.)  <br/>\nHe didn&#39;t understand why anyone in our family wouldn&#39;t help.  Why mom was <br/>\nmaking *him* make the rules.  He was only 13!  It wasn&#39;t his job!  He was <br/>\nfailing a class in school and that was her reason for sending him in for the <br/>\nlast time.  He moved in with my great grandparents but I guess the damamge <br/>\nwas done.  He never recovered from everything that had happened.  He was 25 <br/>\nwhen he died.  NOW, my mother is feeling the guilt.  She lost her job so we <br/>\nmoved in and took over payments.  We found out a few days ago that she <br/>\nwasn&#39;t making the payments we were giving her and the house is in <br/>\nforeclosure, so we are ridding ourselves of the relationship and buying a <br/>\nnew house.  I talked to her the other day (she lives with my grandparents <br/>\nnow) and told her how much it hurt me that she would do this to my family.  <br/>\nEspecially my children.  Her response was, &quot;I know!  I&#39;m losing everything I <br/>\nhave!  Don&#39;t you know I am miserably depressed because I won&#39;t have anything <br/>\nnow?&quot;   She still doesn&#39;t get it.  It&#39;s all about her.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm, here I go again, seriously side-tracking.  Basically, my point is that <br/>\nif I were in your shoes, I&#39;d do everything in my power to help my neice.  <br/>\nWhat happened to her baby?  To me, it doesn&#39;t sound like this poor girl has <br/>\nwhat she needs at home.  Perhaps the family could rally together to help <br/>\nher?  I think showing this article would be of great help.  I know my family <br/>\ndidn&#39;t see the place I was in for what it was(n&#39;t) worth.  They just <br/>\nbelieved my mother, even when their instinct told them otherwise.  Having <br/>\nthe &quot;professionals&quot; on my mom&#39;s side surely didn&#39;t make it any easier for <br/>\nthem to believe me.  I wish they had.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.

My niece is in one of <br/>\nthe schools mentioned in the article.  Her mother, my dh&#39;s sister, is <br/>\na general wreck as a parent so we all saw the blow up coming.  Her <br/>\nother 2 children has alot of problems too so my poor niece was the <br/>\nlast in line and truely crying out for help.  Granted, from what my <br/>\nSIL &quot;told&quot; us she was heavily into drugs by the time she sent her.  <br/>\nHowever, he mother has made horrible decisions and is the kind of <br/>\nperson who blames everything on baf luck.  No ability to take <br/>\nresponsibility.  We were all devestated when we heard. Her mother had <br/>\na habit of keeping her kids away while they were in trouble and then <br/>\nsuddenly you would hear when there was a big blow up (i.e her 15 to <br/>\ndaughter was 5 months pregnant before we heard), mind you the whole <br/>\nfamily sees eachother at all holidays so it is not exactly easy to <br/>\nhide someone.  Anyway, by the time we heard she was sent.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know in your heart it is going to be terrible.  They have sent <br/>\ntwo pictures thus far and she has lost a tremendous amount od <br/>\nweight.  No one can talk to her until she earns X amount if points, <br/>\nlevels.  Me and DH refused to write.  We felt that we would not be a <br/>\nble to express our true feelings because we knew things were being <br/>\nfiltered down to her.  She has been there for about a year (the <br/>\nschool in Jamaica).  The few letters we have recieved are so <br/>\nridiculous, they are like a little kid wrote them.  Everyone has said <br/>\nit sounds like completely brainwashed words. I was crying when I read <br/>\nthe article because I know she will never recover from what they are <br/>\ndoing to her.  Me and DH had talked of taking her in, but mom lives <br/>\nso close and lets her get away with somuch that we could not see it <br/>\nbeing do-able.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what to do??  I am sending the article to her mom although I am <br/>\nsure she will pull out the parts about the mom who claimed it <br/>\nworked.  I also plan to make sure my dh&#39;s whole family gets a copy <br/>\nbecause her mother is not going to quitely hide away.  But beyond <br/>\nthat I am afraid she is going to leave her there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnway, terribly sorry to blab but had to get it off my chest.<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/09/international/americas/09MEXI.html?\">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/09/international/americas/09MEXI.html?</a><br/>\nth<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;It was nighttime,&quot; Ryan recalled. &quot;I look around and I see kids<br/>\n&gt; sleeping on cement.

They drove<br/>\nhim 12 hours south, over the Mexican border, into a high-walled compound<br/>\nnear here called Casa by the Sea.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It was nighttime,&quot; Ryan recalled. &quot;I look around and I see kids<br/>\nsleeping on cement. I was really, really scared.

The<br/>\npunishments for breaking the rules<br/>\nincluded solitary confinement, lying on the floor in a small room, nose<br/>\nto the ground, often for days on end.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan was not a criminal. He was only skipping school, his parents said<br/>\nin telephone interviews. But in August 2000, they said, in the middle of<br/>\na bitter divorce and custody<br/>\nbattle, they decided to send him away to Casa by the Sea, which calls<br/>\nitself a &quot;specialty boarding school&quot; for behavior modification.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike hundreds of other parents, the Fraidenburghs made their choice<br/>\nlargely on the basis of a glossy brochure and a call to a toll-free<br/>\nnumber in Utah. They came to regret<br/>\ntheir choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of sending a child to such a program in Mexico was unheard of a<br/>\ndecade ago. But in the United States, behavior-modification programs and<br/>\nboarding schools for<br/>\ntroubled youths have faced increasing legal and licensing challenges<br/>\nover the past few years.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore and more are moving abroad  some to Mexico, Central America or the<br/>\nCaribbean  where they operate largely under the regulation radar and<br/>\nwhere some employ<br/>\nminimum-wage custodians more than teachers or therapists, say government<br/>\nofficials, education consultants and clinical psychologists.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe behavior-modification business is booming at Casa by the Sea, on<br/>\nMexico&#39;s Pacific Coast, the largest of 11 affiliated programs with<br/>\nroughly 2,200 youths, about half of<br/>\nthem in Mexico, Costa Rica and Jamaica. The programs are run by a small<br/>\ngroup of businessmen based in St. George, Utah, under the banner of the<br/>\nWorld Wide<br/>\nAssociation of Specialty Programs and Schools, or Wwasps, and Teen Help,<br/>\nthe programs&#39; main marketing arm.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the past seven years, local governments and State Department<br/>\nofficials have investigated Wwasps-affiliated programs in Mexico, the<br/>\nCzech Republic and Samoa on<br/>\ncharges of physical abuse and immigration violations. The Mexican<br/>\nprogram, in Cancún, and the Czech program closed, and their owners left<br/>\nthose countries saying they<br/>\nfeared unjust charges. The Samoan program cut its affiliation with<br/>\nWwasps.<br/>\n<br/>\nKen Kay, the president of Wwasps, would not allow a reporter to visit<br/>\nCasa by the Sea; Dace Goulding, the program&#39;s director, declined to<br/>\nanswer any questions. But Mr.<br/>\nKay, responding to inquiries in writing from his office in Utah, said no<br/>\ncharge of abuse had ever been proven against any of the programs in any<br/>\ncourt.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We are about getting families back together,&quot; he said in a written<br/>\nstatement. &quot;We are not for everyone, and there are very few but<br/>\nvociferous critics of not just us but any<br/>\nyouth intervention.&quot; He described many of the program&#39;s critics as<br/>\nparents who feel they have been &quot;manipulated, brainwashed or duped&quot; or<br/>\nwho are battling through divorce<br/>\nand taking their anger out &quot;by making us look terrible.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn telephone interviews, eight teenagers who were formerly in Casa by<br/>\nthe Sea described a system in which the youths try to ascend six<br/>\n&quot;levels&quot; through a system of<br/>\nrewards and punishments, including being sent to &quot;R and R,&quot; a small,<br/>\nbare isolation room, often for days on end. Discipline, not education,<br/>\nwas the rule, they said.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Laura Hamel, 17, of Vienna, Va., who counts herself as a success<br/>\nstory, it was a slow two-year ascent to graduation in March. She said<br/>\nshe was demoted from Level 3<br/>\nback to Level 1 after giving a weeping, lonely friend a hug and a kiss<br/>\non the cheek at Thanksgiving. Affection of that kind is forbidden.<br/>\n<br/>\nA youth who rises to Levels 4, 5 and 6 can become a &quot;junior staff<br/>\nmember&quot; and &quot;participate in the discipline process&quot; against lower-level<br/>\nyouths, Casa&#39;s contract with<br/>\nparents says.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The authority is in your hands,&quot; said Ryan Pink, 19, of El Paso, who<br/>\nreached Level 5 at Casa. &quot;You can discipline kids. The younger kids <br/>\nthey were constantly being<br/>\nrestrained, being punished, put in R and R for four or five days. Nose<br/>\nto the wall. Or nose to the ground. And at night you sleep in the<br/>\nhallways.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMany parents and youths say the behavior-management system of discipline<br/>\nand punishment scares youths into sobriety and obedience. Others <br/>\nparents and youths<br/>\nformerly enrolled, education experts, government authorities and a<br/>\nformer Wwasps program director  say the programs profit from struggling<br/>\nparents unable to handle their<br/>\ndepressed, delinquent, defiant or drug-abusing children.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Their goal is not to help teens in crisis or their families,&quot; according<br/>\nto a former director of one Wwasps-affiliated program, Amberly Knight.<br/>\n&quot;It is to make millions of dollars.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe financial success of Casa by the Sea is evident. Its enrollment has<br/>\nnearly tripled, from about 200 youths when it opened in 1998 to more<br/>\nthan 570 today, almost all<br/>\nAmerican teenagers. Already among the biggest programs of its kind<br/>\noutside the United States, Casa by the Sea has just spun off another<br/>\nprogram for those 18 and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuition and fees at Casa by the Sea run about $30,000 a year, half of<br/>\nwhat some United States-based programs cost. Its staff members &quot;do not<br/>\nneed and may not<br/>\nnecessarily have&quot; teaching credentials, Casa&#39;s contract with parents<br/>\nplainly states.<br/>\n<br/>\nLon Woodbury, publisher of Woodbury Reports, which rates schools and<br/>\nprograms for troubled teenagers inside and outside the United States,<br/>\nsaid one reason that<br/>\nAmerican programs have moved abroad is &quot;to avoid the laws and<br/>\nregulations of the States.&quot; He added, &quot;They can hire minimum-wage staff<br/>\nand still charge stateside prices.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nProfit margins and growth within the programs run by Wwasps appear<br/>\nsolid. Teen Help, the affiliation&#39;s main marketing arm, was the single<br/>\nbiggest corporate campaign<br/>\ncontributor in the state of Utah in the 2002 election cycle, donating<br/>\n$215,290 to Republican campaigns, according to online federal election<br/>\nrecords posted in March.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Kay, the Wwasps president, said that the proof of the programs&#39;<br/>\nsuccess is the way in which &quot;behavior of students generally changes<br/>\ndrastically.&quot; The organization&#39;s<br/>\ninternal surveys, he said, proved that &quot;more than 98 percent of the<br/>\nschools&#39; parents are completely satisfied.&quot; He wrote, &quot;No wonder these<br/>\nare the fastest growing Schools of<br/>\ntheir kind in the world!!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe overseas &quot;specialty boarding school&quot; industry is growing so fast<br/>\nthat United States consular officials in overseas embassies say they<br/>\nhave no idea how many such<br/>\nprograms exist.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No authorities in Mexico control these institutions,&quot; said Elisa<br/>\nLedesma, a lawyer at the American Consulate in Tijuana. Consular<br/>\nofficers demanded and received access<br/>\nto several such programs in Mexico, one official said, after they &quot;heard<br/>\nhorror stories from parents.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe consular officers have the power, under the Vienna Convention, to<br/>\nvisit overseas programs to check on the well-being of American citizens<br/>\nunder 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn January, after several such visits, the State Department issued a<br/>\nnotice on &quot;behavior modification facilities&quot; in Mexico, Costa Rica and<br/>\nJamaica. The programs may<br/>\n&quot;isolate the children in relatively remote sites&quot; and restrict their<br/>\ncontact with the outside world, it said.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least seven programs in Utah, Montana, South Carolina and New York<br/>\nare Wwasps affiliates, according to the organization&#39;s Web site; at<br/>\nleast three have faced legal<br/>\nchallenges. Utah state officials say they are reviewing the license of<br/>\nthe flagship Wwasps program, Cross Creek Manor, and that a second<br/>\nprogram, Majestic Ranch, is<br/>\noperating without a proper license.<br/>\n<br/>\nSix weeks ago, according to the state attorney general&#39;s office in Utah,<br/>\na director of Majestic Ranch entered into a court agreement to have no<br/>\nunsupervised contact with<br/>\nchildren after he was charged with misdemeanor child abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttorneys for both programs contest the licensing challenges. South<br/>\nCarolina officials have fined a third Wwasps program, Carolina Springs<br/>\nAcademy, $5,000 for operating<br/>\nwithout a license.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile some dissatisfied parents have sued Wwasps and its programs, the<br/>\ncontract that parents sign with Casa by the Sea sets high hurdles for<br/>\nthem. It states plainly that<br/>\nthe program &quot;does not accept responsibility for services written in<br/>\nsales materials or brochures&quot; or promises made by &quot;staff or public<br/>\nrelations personnel&quot; and that any<br/>\ndispute between a parent and the program must be settled in a Mexican<br/>\ncourt, not in the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Wwasps programs market themselves under a multitude of interlinked<br/>\nWeb sites. Their sales personnel offer thousands of dollars in<br/>\nincentives to adults who recruit new<br/>\nyouths or host Web sites advertising the programs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome parents said in interviews that they enrolled their children in<br/>\nprograms they had never visited after browsing Web sites, brochures and<br/>\nvideotapes depicting happy<br/>\nchildren in a wholesome setting.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I sent him there sight unseen,&quot; said Patti Reddoch, of Sweeny, Tex.,<br/>\nwho considered Dundee Ranch for her son, Edmund Brumaghin, now 17, but<br/>\nchose Casa by the Sea<br/>\ninstead. &quot;The music he was listening to started getting darker and he<br/>\nwas getting more into the drugs, and that&#39;s when I decided I needed to<br/>\ndo something.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So I went on the Internet and started searching around and found the<br/>\nWwasp program. I contacted them and made the arrangements, and that&#39;s<br/>\npretty much it. It didn&#39;t take<br/>\nme any time at all.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMrs. Reddoch, speaking by telephone, said she then hired an &quot;escort<br/>\nservice&quot; familiar with Casa by the Sea to handcuff and transport her son<br/>\naway at 5 a.m. one Sunday<br/>\nlast September.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat morning, her son cursed her bitterly, but now his attitude is<br/>\nchanging, she said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am very pleased with the school,&quot; said Ms. Reddoch, who said she<br/>\nvisited Casa by the Sea once, for a weekend, last January. &quot;I&#39;ve started<br/>\nputting out brochures for<br/>\nreferrals. I would recommend Casa to anyone.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nReality may differ from the brochures, however. &quot;Everyone has a shaved<br/>\nhead,&quot; Michael Zieghelboim, who was formerly enrolled at Casa by the<br/>\nSea, said in a telephone<br/>\ninterview. &quot;They walk around like zombies. Most of the staff have no<br/>\ntraining.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Casa by the Sea was the scariest thing that ever happened to me,&quot; said<br/>\nMr. Zieghelboim, who now lives with his father in El Salvador.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said that despite falling behind in his education at Casa by the Sea<br/>\n at 17, he is now in the 10th grade  he rates himself a success. &quot;If I<br/>\nhad never gone there, I&#39;d<br/>\nprobably still be doing cocaine,&quot; he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis kind of tough discipline is an attraction for many exasperated<br/>\nparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe program runs &quot;a very tight ship,&quot; said Virginia Day, of Redmond,<br/>\nWash., who sent her son, Gabriel, 15, to the program in July.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The staff that works most closely with the kids are not necessarily<br/>\nprofessionals, and I know that this is an issue,&quot; said Ms. Day, who<br/>\ncalled herself a very satisfied<br/>\ncustomer. &quot;This is not a school that specializes in a therapeutic<br/>\ncomponent.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol Maxym, an educational consultant in Maryland, said: &quot;What they are<br/>\nlooking for at Casa is compliance. Compliance is easy, if you break the<br/>\nkid down enough. And<br/>\ncompliance is cheap.&quot; She added, &quot;The parents often don&#39;t realize what&#39;s<br/>\ngoing on.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYouths and staff at other overseas Wwasps programs have described harsh<br/>\nconditions. One was Aaron Kravig, now 19. He said he contracted scabies,<br/>\nuntreated for six<br/>\nmonths, ate meals of watery porridge and fish entrails, and was schooled<br/>\nalmost solely with &quot;emotional growth&quot; videos at Tranquility Bay, the<br/>\nWwasps-affiliated program in<br/>\nJamaica, according to a transcript of sworn testimony he gave last year<br/>\nat a Virginia state court hearing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Costa Rica, Ms. Knight, the former director of the Wwasps-affiliated<br/>\nAcademy at Dundee Ranch, resigned in August after sending a letter to<br/>\nthe national minister of child<br/>\nwelfare calling for the program to be shut down.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe letter said the program was &quot;hiring unqualified, untrained, staff&quot;<br/>\nand providing &quot;the bare minimum of food and living essentials.&quot; It said<br/>\nthe program &quot;takes financial<br/>\nadvantage of parents in crisis, and puts teens in physical and emotional<br/>\nrisk.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe speed with which some parents choose an overseas<br/>\nbehavioral-modification program for their children baffles some<br/>\neducational consultants.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I find it incredible that parents would send their kids off to some<br/>\nplace they&#39;ve heard about on the Internet,&quot; Mr. Woodbury said.<br/>\n<br/>\nMs. Maxym, author of &quot;Teens in Turmoil: A Path to Change for Parents,<br/>\nAdolescents and their Families&quot; (Viking Penguin, 2000) said, &quot;I find it<br/>\ninteresting that parents will<br/>\nspend less time finding a school for their child than buying a new car.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan Fraidenburgh&#39;s father, Bob, an aerospace engineering executive,<br/>\nsaid he had only glanced at Casa by the Sea&#39;s &quot;brochures that looked<br/>\nlike Club Med.&quot; He said he<br/>\nremoved Ryan from the program by himself in January 2001 after deciding<br/>\nhe had been too hasty.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We made a huge mistake,&quot; he said. &quot;Until the day I die I&#39;ll regret<br/>\nthat.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan&#39;s mother, Carolyn, said: &quot;We were expecting treatment, not a<br/>\nminimum-wage person to watch over your kid like he was an animal in a<br/>\ncage.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                            Copyright 2003 The New York Times Company</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68454,"nextTopicId":68470}}
