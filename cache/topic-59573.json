I<br/>\nwould read the part to him and he would memorize all of his lines.  At about<br/>\n8 1/2 he started reading some, by 9 1/2  he read The Hobbit (with good<br/>\ncomprehension, according to dh, because ds talked about it every day with<br/>\nhim).  Next ds, now almost 11, started reading at about 8 1/2, then last<br/>\nyear read a lot of Boxcar Children and has gotten through the 4 Harry Potter<br/>\nbooks<br/>\nsince last summer.  Youngest ds, almost 9, still reads only a few words and<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem too concerned, except when in a forced reading situation.  He<br/>\nquit cub scouts last month because the new den leader never lets them play<br/>\nrunning around games, on the playground or in the gym, but gives them word<br/>\ngames like hangman.  Ds 8 said it&#39;s Boring!  He was in two plays recently,<br/>\nin Dec. and in Jan., and had memorized his parts in about 3 days (Ollie in<br/>\nBest Xmas Pageant and 3 small roles in Wind in the Willows).  He didn&#39;t<br/>\nwrite down his blocking, but he never forgot a direction.  Ds 12 is this way<br/>\ntoo, even tho he reads fine now.  I think maybe because they relied on<br/>\nlistening and following directions they have stronger skills in that area.<br/>\nPlus I think they&#39;re just blessed with good memories.  That helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda R.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59524,"nextTopicId":59576}}
