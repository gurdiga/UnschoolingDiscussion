So it&#39;s<br/>\nthe unschooling part that makes you wonder sometimes. I think maybe the<br/>\ncircumstances as to how you came about to unschool can make the difference<br/>\ndepending on the person. I know some people who have taken their children<br/>\nout of school when the kids themselves weren&#39;t having a &quot;terrible&quot; time, it<br/>\nwas the parents who didn&#39;t like what they saw. They have expressed at one<br/>\ntime or another if it was really the right thing for the child. Some parents<br/>\nI know who have never had children in school also express that doubt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one child who has always gone to school. When she was having problems<br/>\nand not liking it, I wasn&#39;t able to pull her out and homeschool her. By the<br/>\ntime I was able to take her out freely, she had learned how to manage the<br/>\nsystem and was actually doing better than she ever had. In 8 more days, she<br/>\nwill be a senior and have only one year left. I think I&#39;m looking forward to<br/>\nit more than her!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other 3 have never been to school. Maybe that&#39;s why I don&#39;t have the<br/>\ndoubts that unschooling is the right thing for them. (yet, I&#39;m aware that<br/>\nmight come as they get older) Because I have had it both ways and see this<br/>\nchoice as the best, knowing what my other choices really are. If this is all<br/>\nfairly new to you, I can understand why &quot;if I&#39;m doing the best thing&quot; comes<br/>\nup. And I would also imagine that even people not new to it, having their<br/>\nchildren grow and become different can also bring about the questions. I<br/>\njust haven&#39;t had them.....yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Yeah, that&#39;s exactly what I wanted that day.  In fact, her dad did the<br/>\ninteraction for most of the rest of the day (luckly it was Sunday and he was<br/>\nnot at work).  I&#39;m not proud of it.  That&#39;s why I asked if other people had<br/>\npatience problems and are still unschoolers.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember being frustrated when Tara was a baby. She was my first and I<br/>\ntried for a long time to have her. (to me) She was a very difficult baby.<br/>\nShe seemed like she hated being a baby. I had NO experience with babies at<br/>\nall. My then husband was absolutely NO help even though he had another<br/>\nchild. Parenting was MY job. My mom was around but I had just lost my dad<br/>\nthe year before and well, she was having emotions of her own. Tara<br/>\nfrustrated me. I was younger then and very  inexperienced. I felt alone and<br/>\nsometimes I would make sure Tara was with someone and just go and cry<br/>\nsomewhere. I felt like I wasn&#39;t doing a good enough job and failing her. I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to hang it up though, it just made me more determined. After<br/>\nall, I didn&#39;t have much time to feel sorry, I had a screaming baby waiting<br/>\nfor me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Joseph came I was in my late 30&#39;s. New husband and new maturity. I<br/>\nforgot all the books and well meaning family members and let my motherly<br/>\ninstincts take over. I haven&#39;t had that frustrating time like I did with<br/>\nTara since. I&#39;m not at all saying anyone with doubts isn&#39;t mature or<br/>\nexperienced. Just that this was my experience and how it became so different<br/>\nfor me because of my circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It is great you never feel that way.  I really wish I never did, either.<br/>\nI do sometimes &quot;feel like I bit off more than I can chew&quot;.<br/>\nI am a parent.  I came into it willingly.  I love my daughter.  I think<br/>\nunschooling is the best way of life.  We are unschoolers.  However, my<br/>\nquestion reflected my doubts about if it&#39;s still best if the parent most<br/>\ninvolved has trouble keeping his/her patience.<br/>\nI feel like I should clarify at this point that I never physically harm<br/>\nDavan and, while there are angry outbursts, I am able to keep them to &quot;I am<br/>\nangry about what is happening&quot; type comments and never &quot;you stupid little<br/>\ngirl&quot; type comments.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNot wanting to feel that way and recognizing that it happens every once in<br/>\nawhile is a great start as far as I&#39;m concerned. Not seeing that you lose<br/>\npatience would be a real problem. You&#39;ll find the way because you want to.<br/>\nYou just have to have patience that it will come!! I have no doubts just<br/>\nfrom your few posts that you do love your children and do them no harm. I<br/>\nnever got that impression at all. When we know better, we do better. And<br/>\nwanting to always be better as a mom is important, at least for me. Just<br/>\nbecause I never felt like hanging it up doesn&#39;t mean I haven&#39;t realized that<br/>\nmany times the way I have handled something hasn&#39;t been the best way for my<br/>\nkids. After 4 it still happens more than I would like, but hey, I&#39;m only<br/>\nhuman. I will never expect to be perfect but I do want to be able to see the<br/>\nbest way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"jmcseals SEALS","from":"&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Patience was One Lurker Says Hi","postDate":"1053367772","msgId":69948,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjg0b0d1bTNkeHg1VVIwMDAzNWU3OEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69939,"nextInTopic":69963,"prevInTime":69947,"nextInTime":69949,"topicId":69939,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**I feel like I should clarify at this point that I never physically harm Davan and, while there are angry outbursts, I am able to keep them to I am angry","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1159221255\">**I feel like I should clarify at this point that I never physically harm <br/>\nDavan and, while there are angry outbursts, I am able to keep them to &quot;I am <br/>\nangry about what is happening&quot; type comments and never &quot;you stupid little <br/>\ngirl&quot; type comments.**<br/>\n<br/>\nYou didn&#39;t need to clarify, for me anyway.
