For some 17<br/>\ndays, he tended the hundreds of injured and dying men; the casualties of<br/>\ntrench warfare.<br/>\n<br/>\n Never in his career had he witnessed so much pain and suffering.  His<br/>\nanquish on that battlefield gave him the inspiration to write a poem; a poem<br/>\nwhich not only pays homage to those who died in that conflict, but perhaps<br/>\nmore importantly, admonishes the beneficiaries of their sacrifice, to never<br/>\nforget; to live their lives in such a way that those who died will not have<br/>\ndied in vain.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Flanders fields the poppies blow<br/>\nBetween the crosses, row on row,<br/>\nThat mark our place; and in the sky<br/>\nThe larks, still bravely singing, fly<br/>\nScarce heard amid the guns below.<br/>\nWe are the Dead. Short days ago<br/>\nWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,<br/>\nLoved and were loved, and now we lie<br/>\nIn Flanders fields.<br/>\nTake up our quarrel with the foe:<br/>\nTo you from failing hands we throw<br/>\nThe torch; be yours to hold it high.<br/>\nIf ye break with us who die<br/>\nWe shall not sleep, though poppies grow<br/>\nIn Flanders fields.<br/>\n    --Major John McCrae<br/>\n<br/>\nMay we all take some time this Veteran&#39;s Day to remember those who died, and<br/>\nrecommit ourselves to the cause of peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen<br/>\nUncoventional Ideas at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unconventionalideas.com\">http://www.unconventionalideas.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14085,"nextTopicId":14084}}
