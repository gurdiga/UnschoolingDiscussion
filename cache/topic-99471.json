Welcome to the walking park.<br/>\n<br/>\n***********************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce upon a time there was a place where almost all the people lived on a<br/>\ntrain. The train went forward at a great pace and of course stayed on the<br/>\ntracks, so the view was the same from all the windows. Most of families<br/>\nstayed in the same carriage for the whole journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome families didn&#39;t care for the train, so they got on their bicycles<br/>\ninstead. Many of these families followed right beside the train, and pedaled<br/>\nas hard as they needed to, to stay with it. Others followed the increasingly<br/>\nnumerous bike paths that were set up that started at the depot and ended at<br/>\nthe terminus, but were often more winding and scenic than the train route.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt some distance from the tracks, was a garden park that was full of<br/>\nwalkers. The walkers meandered around sometimes, and at other times were<br/>\nseen to be walking briskly forward or even jogging. To the astonishment of<br/>\npassing cyclists, sometimes walkers in the beautiful garden were seen to be<br/>\nlounging around on the grass, or smelling the flowers. As for the people on<br/>\nthe train, they could barely see the garden, let alone notice the<br/>\ninhabitants.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the gateway to the garden there was always a gate keeper. People who had<br/>\njumped off the train, as well as the occasional passing cyclist would<br/>\ninquire about how to get in, and the gate keeper would smile and say that it<br/>\nwas a walking park, and the only thing inside was foot traffic. Sometimes<br/>\nhostile cyclists would come close to the gate and shout out that the walkers<br/>\nweren&#39;t going anywhere and should be cycling also, or try to show off with<br/>\ntrick riding, but the walkers would always just keep walking, sitting,<br/>\njogging or dancing along, having such a good time that lots of folks<br/>\nabandoned their bikes and joined in.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day a cyclist arrived at the gate and wanted to go cycling in the park,<br/>\nbecause it looked so beautiful. The gate keeper said, &quot;This is a walking<br/>\npark. There are no directions, or maps, or paths.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cyclist replied, &quot;But this is a free country and I should be able to<br/>\ncycle if I want to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gate keeper said, &quot;Then go cycle. There are hundreds of bike paths, but<br/>\nthis is a walking park.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cyclist said, &quot;You can get along so much faster on a bike. There are<br/>\nfewer distractions. Biking is better.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gate keeper said, &quot;Biking is not better in a walking park. The people<br/>\nwho are walking here have agreed that no-one can ride a bike in here. Your<br/>\nbike will be perfectly safe outside the gate if you ever want to come out<br/>\nand use it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cyclist went off in a huff, but was back the next day. <br/>\nShe said, &quot;What if I agree to walk, can I go in and carry my bike?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWalking in the beautiful park is way harder if you are hauling around your<br/>\nuseless bike. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

My mom, who is not fond of the idea is nagging me about &quot;getting started&quot; with Parker&#39;s education.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy question I have is on unschooling.  I don&#39;t even mention to others that I&#39;m planning on this because I feel it would be like pouring rubbing alcohol on an open wound.  How, what when do I start all this?  <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLeslie<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
