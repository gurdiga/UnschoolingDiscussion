But i <br/>\nagree that breastfeeding/child led weaning parallels unschooling in a <br/>\nway. And all this discussion has given me an appreciation for the <br/>\nnursing relationship I have had with my younger two, and missed out <br/>\non the older one (the one that was sent to school for years).<br/>\n<br/>\nI can relate to the post about being busy nursing on vacation, we <br/>\nwent to myrtle beach when my youngest was 5 weeks old. The trip was <br/>\nplanned before the conception LOL. I am not a big vacation taker, and <br/>\ni spent most of the time in the airconditioned suite being with my <br/>\nbaby boy, while everyone else ran around town. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there was the boat trip to Johnstown to collect shells, <br/>\nAshlyn was not even two, and was scared on the boat. We sat in the <br/>\nback of the boat trying to keep a blanket from blowing off as I <br/>\ntandem nursed for the only time in public. I am a very discreet <br/>\nnurser, and that was a challenge. My sister took delight in taking <br/>\nadvantage and snapping a picture. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter who nursed until three was given a baby bottle of water <br/>\non a road trip when she was almost a year old, and she never would <br/>\ntake a pacifier. She would occasionally do the bottle of water. She <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t wean when I was pregnant and completely dried up. SHe nursed <br/>\nuntil her brother was a year old, and I tried for months distracting <br/>\nher away from nursing. She was more &quot;attached&quot; in the sense that she <br/>\ncried more, was in the sling constantly, even when I was first <br/>\npregnant with brother. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow my 2yo son has never had any artificial nipple, so now my theory <br/>\nthat he is less attached/more independant and will wean sooner <br/>\nprobably will not play out. He was not in the sling that much at all, <br/>\nvery happy and independant, but shy and loves mommy and baby milk. He <br/>\nhas only been able to say Baby Milk for a few weeks, but he talks <br/>\nabout it in his sleep. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I am not going to push the weaning. I am going to continue the <br/>\ndon&#39;t offer/don&#39;t refuse, but man he nurses a lot as long as we are <br/>\nhome. I need to get out more. He also wakes up a lot in the night to <br/>\nnurse, which I get tired of. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh, being more proactive, up and decided to get a tv and hook a <br/>\nvcr in their room to get them both to sleep in there. I can&#39;t say it <br/>\nis working. And BL(before this list), I was very much against tv&#39;s in <br/>\nbedrooms. So, whatever. They both ended up with me the same night, <br/>\nand he hit the couch. My almost 4yo sometimes likes to sleep in her <br/>\nbed, but that night she had bad dreams about mommy and daddy getting <br/>\nhurt. So screw the TV. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;ll have plenty of time to sleep without kids when they are <br/>\ngrowing up too fast, and I will lay awake wondering where the time <br/>\nwent and wishing for just a few more moments of cuddling with my <br/>\nbabies....<br/>\n<br/>\nAng</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118406848,"authorName":"Joylyn","from":"Joylyn &lt;joylyn@...&gt;","profile":"joylynrsf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] breastfeeding","postDate":"1056183292","msgId":75071,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFRjQxM0ZDLjEwNjA1MDZAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMGMwMWMzMzc2NyRhYmU5ZWVlMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+IDwzRUYzQTBCRC41MDMwMjAwQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+IDwwMDU0MDFjMzM3OTckYThiYzJkYzAkNjEwMWE4YzBAbGF1bmNobW9kZW0uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":75056,"nextInTopic":75079,"prevInTime":75070,"nextInTime":75072,"topicId":3627,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... exactly.

You<br/>\nmay ask, &quot;But why would anyone want to nurse a toddler? How will he become<br/>\nindependent?&quot; Dr. Jack Newman answers our concerns and reveals the often<br/>\noverlooked benefits of nursing a toddler. <br/>\n <br/>\nBreastfeed a Toddler - Why on Earth?<br/>\nBecause more and more women are now breastfeeding their babies, more and<br/>\nmore are also finding that they enjoy breastfeeding enough to want to<br/>\ncontinue longer than the usual few months they initially thought they would<br/>\ndo it. <br/>\n<br/>\nUNICEF has long encouraged breastfeeding for two years and longer, and the<br/>\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics is now on record as encouraging mothers to<br/>\nnurse at least one year and as long after as both mother and baby desire.<br/>\nBreastfeeding to 3 and 4 years of age has been common in much of the world<br/>\nuntil recently, and breastfeeding toddlers is still common in many societies. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy should breastfeeding continue past six months?<br/>\nBecause mothers and babies often enjoy breastfeeding a lot. Why stop an<br/>\nenjoyable relationship? <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n But it is said that breastmilk has no value after six months.<br/>\nPerhaps this is said, but it is wrong. That anyone can say such a thing<br/>\nonly shows how ignorant so many people in our society are about<br/>\nbreastfeeding. Breastmilk is, after all, milk. Even after six months, it<br/>\nstill contains protein, fat, and other nutritionally important and<br/>\nappropriate elements which babies and children need. <br/>\n <br/>\nBreastmilk still contains immunologic factors which help protect the baby.<br/>\nIn fact, some immune factors in breastmilk which protect the baby against<br/>\ninfection are present in greater amounts in the second year of life than in<br/>\nthe first. This is, of course as it should be, since children older than a<br/>\nyear are generally exposed to more infection. Breastmilk still contains<br/>\nfactors which help the immune system to mature, and which help the brain,<br/>\ngut, and other organs to develop and mature. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been well shown that children in daycare who are still breastfeeding<br/>\nhave far fewer and less severe infections than the children who are not<br/>\nbreastfeeding. The mother thus loses less work time if she continues<br/>\nnursing her baby once she is back at her paid work. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is interesting that formula company marketing pushes the use of formula<br/>\n(a rather imperfect copy of the real thing) for a year, yet implies that<br/>\nbreastmilk (from which the imperfect copy is copied) is only worthwhile for<br/>\n6 months. Too many health professionals have taken up the refrain. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard that the immunologic factors prevent the baby from developing<br/>\nhis own immunity if I breastfeed past six months.<br/>\nThis is untrue; in fact, this is absurd. It is unbelievable how so many<br/>\npeople in our society twist around the advantages of breastfeeding and turn<br/>\nthem into disadvantages. We give babies immunizations so that they are able<br/>\nto defend themselves against the real infection. <br/>\n<br/>\nBreastmilk also allows the baby to be able to fight off infections. When<br/>\nthe baby fights off these infections, he becomes immune. Naturally. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I want my baby to become independent.<br/>\nAnd breastfeeding makes the toddler dependent? Don&#39;t believe it. The child<br/>\nwho breastfeeds until he weans himself (usually from 2 to 4 years), is<br/>\ngenerally more independent, and, perhaps more importantly, more secure in<br/>\nhis independence. He has received comfort and security from the breast,<br/>\nuntil he is ready to make the step himself to stop. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when he makes that step himself, he knows he has achieved something, he<br/>\nknows he has moved ahead. It is a milestone in his life. Often we push<br/>\nchildren to become &quot;independent&quot; too quickly. To sleep alone too soon, to<br/>\nwean from the breast too soon, to do without their parents too soon, to do<br/>\neverything too soon. Don&#39;t push and the child will become independent soon<br/>\nenough. What&#39;s the rush? Soon they will be leaving home. You want them to<br/>\nleave home at 14? <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, breastfeeding can, in some situations, be used to foster an<br/>\nover-dependent relationship. But so can food and toilet training. The<br/>\nproblem is not the breastfeeding. This is another issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else?<br/>\nPossibly the most important aspect of nursing a toddler is not the<br/>\nnutritional or immunologic benefits, important as they are. I believe the<br/>\nmost important aspect of nursing a toddler is the special relationship<br/>\nbetween child and mother. <br/>\n<br/>\nBreastfeeding is a life affirming act of love. This continues when the baby<br/>\nbecomes a toddler. Anyone without prejudices, who has ever observed an<br/>\nolder baby or toddler nursing can testify that there is something almost<br/>\nmagical, something special, something far beyond food going on. A nursing<br/>\ntoddler will sometimes spontaneously break into laughter for no obvious<br/>\nreason. His delight in the breast goes far beyond a source of food. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if the mother allows herself, breastfeeding becomes a source of delight<br/>\nfor her as well, far beyond the pleasure of providing food. Of course, it&#39;s<br/>\nnot always great, but what is? But when it is, it makes it all so worthwhile. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if the child does become ill or does get hurt (and they do as they meet<br/>\nother children and become more daring), what easier way to comfort the<br/>\nchild than breastfeeding? I remember nights in the emergency department<br/>\nwhen mothers would walk their ill, non nursing babies or toddlers up and<br/>\ndown the halls trying, often unsuccessfully, to console them, while the<br/>\nnursing mothers were sitting quietly with their comforted, if not<br/>\nnecessarily happy, babies at the breast. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mother comforts the sick child with breastfeeding, and the child<br/>\ncomforts the mother by breastfeeding.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"metta","from":"metta &lt;metta@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"wyrCKFlpwQv2-yK9GwrJpu3pmnUn9Glb_JkS8yLjt_jfjebfQ5wG5eaEsU5Nur4ZaMpc313u1tSTpOrD3vFxNKfCaQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] breastfeeding","postDate":"954871537","msgId":7710,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI1MEY3RDAxLkYzNkIlbWV0dGFAcGFjaWZpY25ldC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGE5LjNjYWJmZTkuMjYxYjc0YThAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":7705,"nextInTopic":15883,"prevInTime":7709,"nextInTime":7711,"topicId":3627,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I wasn&#39;t there and don&#39;t know all the<br/>\ndetails.  La Leche League Leaders are VOLUNTEERS and are not required to<br/>\nmake home visits.  (Although some will, did you ask?)  Because most LLL<br/>\nLeaders have children at home, making home visits would require that they<br/>\nfind a babysitter or bring their children with them.  Lactation<br/>\nconsultants are paid, and many of them will make home visits, for a fee.<br/>\nWhen we talk about breastfeeding and health issues, its a numbers game. <br/>\nBreastfed children can become ill.  Artificial baby-milk fed children can<br/>\nbe quite healthy.  But if you look at 1000&#39;s of children, those who were<br/>\nbreastfed are less likely to be seriously ill, less likely to be<br/>\nhospitalized for illnesses, and have shorter durations of illness.  In<br/>\nsome parts of the world, children not breastfed die everyday!<br/>\nIn spite of the small number of women who truly CAN&#39;T breastfeed, it is<br/>\nstill the best choice for all the rest!
