The other day I splurged and had an ice cream<br/>\ncone, I haven&#39;t had dairy in 10 months. Within 24 hours, my poor little girl<br/>\nhad a totally stopped-up runny nose, was pulling on her ears, not sleeping<br/>\nat night, etc. Food allergies are definitely the first thing she might want<br/>\nto investigate. Worse than the sleeping problems are the other issues - is<br/>\nher child hearing well enough for early language acquisition, etc. Food<br/>\nallergies can be to anything, but the first things to eliminate are probably<br/>\ndairy & wheat. It takes up to 6 - 8 weeks to get the dairy out of the<br/>\nsystem, so tell her to keep with it for a couple of months if she can. Other<br/>\ncommon allergens are soy, corn, nuts, and fish/shellfish.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n  -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;Look, it&#39;s a harvested moon!&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) who said &quot;Agua&quot; as she reached for my water bottle<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sonia Ulan","from":"Sonia Ulan &lt;sulan@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"IUfcjvhFe6MpFSLReFkD6-Fx_1e_va0ojQJIUB6Jr52y8-FXIrHn4Y0DojilK3muca-rLvcWici5y6kutyky32nm","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] ear trouble","postDate":"971687164","msgId":13675,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5RUFDNEZDLjUxRUQ0MUE0QGhvbWUuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDYxLjdmNmMzZmMuMjcxYjU5M2NAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":13674,"nextInTopic":13679,"prevInTime":13674,"nextInTime":13676,"topicId":13663,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh yes, I have heard about this too!
