I can&#39;t speak for all in LLL, but in my experience the idea was to encourage moms to consider alternatives to full time work outside the home because babies and mothers need each other as much as they need to breastfeed.  But, if a woman is going to work it is still better if the baby gets her breastmilk and she can breastfeed when she is with the baby.  We also talked about delaying the return to work as long as possible, working as few hours away from home as possible, having a caretaker bring the baby in to be nursed rather than pumping and other possibilities.  None of those as good as being with baby all the time, but all better than total weaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were a couple of moms in our group who worked and the baby got most of it&#39;s milk during the night through co-sleeping.  We often encouraged those mothers to share their story when the issue came up.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it is similar to the way that steps toward unschooling are better than &quot;school at home&quot;.  A mom who works and breastfeeds her first baby might be more likely to just stay home with the next one.  Maybe.  Or maybe she will return to work, continue breastfeeding, and realize work is not the world she wants to be in right then.  That is what happened to me.  When I quit my outside job, I was still a breastfeeding mother because I had continued to breastfeed while working.<br/>\n<br/>\nBig steps might be best, but little steps are better than no steps.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Attachment Parenting and Unschooling was: I wish I had known","postDate":"1108417432","msgId":103420,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkyLjIwOGE3NWM5LjJmNDI3NTk4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103416,"nextInTopic":103421,"prevInTime":103419,"nextInTime":103421,"topicId":103360,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/14/05 1:45:15 PM, pamsoroosh@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1628428249\">In a message dated 2/14/05 1:45:15 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Well - men are at more risk for an actual physical fight if things <br/>\nstart to feel confrontational.... &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, and then they make up and go out for a beer. <br/>\nWomen hurt each other badly but invisibly and then hate each other for years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(Am I exaggerating or stereotyping?

It was fairly chaotic there and usually the needs were something like, Mom, I dumped the honey on my head and it&#39;s stinging my eyes, Gavin get down from the entertainment center, and the infant crying.  My SIL would do her best to prioritize and get the quick things out of the way if the baby needed to nurse or something.  However, my daughter would be completely distraught that no one was rushing to hold the baby right away.  She would call to me saying, &quot;He NEEDS you, Mom!!!&quot;  If I was also necessarily delayed for a minute (with my heart breaking) my daughter would pat his feet and sing to him and try to soothe him.

While leaders might find it personally <br/>\nchallenging to help moms who are struggling with a nighttime <br/>\nparenting issue and are inclined toward &quot;letting baby cry alone in a <br/>\ncrib&quot;,(and many moms don&#39;t become leaders because of this), the <br/>\nLLLLeader would encourage the mother to examine her feelings by <br/>\nusing active listening techniques and in a meeting situation, would <br/>\nask other moms for ideas about what worked for them in similar <br/>\nsituations or would simply say that &quot;many moms have found that <br/>\nbringing baby close to you at night is helpful, or sidecar  or <br/>\ncosleeping or whatever...&quot; The goal is to give information and not <br/>\nadvice and by using this technique you empower moms and boost their <br/>\nconfidence and guide them to put aside conventional wisdom and <br/>\nothers opinions and to examine what THEY feel is best for their <br/>\nchild- I liked how Sandra put it-   encouraging a partnership with <br/>\nyour baby.  Most LLLLeaders would discourage the crying it out in a <br/>\ncrib because that violates one of the ten concepts which is (yes, I <br/>\nam quoting again- well trained leader that I am)&quot;From infancy on, <br/>\nchildren need loving guidance which reflects acceptance of their <br/>\ncapabilities and sensitivity to their feelings.&quot; AH- so I guess it <br/>\nisn&#39;t completely balanced as most leaders wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nsuggest &quot;ferberizing&quot; your baby...but we would say &quot;It seems like <br/>\nthat that worked for Jane and I am glad you found a solution to your <br/>\nsleep issues, Does anyone else have a different experience?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nCOnventional parenting may meet baby&#39;s basic need for food but when <br/>\nbabies go from one container to another and mothers are constatnly <br/>\nencourages to take breaks and encourage independence from their baby-<br/>\nit is no wonder they have no idea that their baby is a full person <br/>\ntoo!

Ferber describes cry it out as scheduled crying.  API would encourage picking up and holding a crying infant, trying to figure out what is causing the child to cry to meet the child&#39;s needs, and then if nothing can be discovered, simply holding the child to let them know that they are loved and valued and not abandoned, even if we can&#39;t understand what needs they are trying to communicate to us.  There are some children, however, that do prefer to be put down.  And so the need that is causing the child to cry might actually be to be put down.  If your child wants down, holding him while he is crying isn&#39;t helping him.  But if he is crying for some other reason, most often he will be at least somewhat soothed by being close to mom, even if he doesn&#39;t stop crying.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I mentioned cry it out in the context of LLL and breastfeeding I was talking about the various cry it out techniques of systematically teaching a child to sleep through cry it out (actually learned hopelessness and subsequent abandonment of attempts to communicate needs for closeness through crying).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah Harper<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, February 13, 2005 7:41 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] &quot;Cry it out&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 2/13/05 5:33:15 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jimpetersonl@...\">jimpetersonl@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; I did not realize it was defined as not checking basic needs and then<br/>\n<br/>\n  some. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think it&#39;s going by the clock, or by mom&#39;s mood.  &quot;It&#39;s 8:00 and that&#39;s his <br/>\n  bedtime&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t deal with him anymore, let him cry himself to sleep.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Others regard this <br/>\narrangement, known as co-sleeping, as a way to build strong families and emotionally <br/>\nsecure children. New data suggest that this debate is too simplistic. Two <br/>\ncontrasting types of co-sleeping exist in the United States, say Meret A. Keller and <br/>\nWendy A. Goldberg, both of the University of California, Irvine.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf co-sleeping begins after an infant reaches age 1 and in response to the <br/>\nchild&#39;s bedtime struggles, sleep is often disrupted for everyone in the bed and <br/>\nfamily tensions are increased, the psychologists hold. However, co-sleeping <br/>\ngenerally proceeds smoothly when it begins within the first few months of an <br/>\ninfant&#39;s birth and continues into toddlerhood, Keller and Goldberg report in the <br/>\nDecember 2004 Infant and Child Development.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe researchers surveyed 83 mothers of California preschoolers. Of that <br/>\nnumber, 32 said that their child had always slept in a separate room, 28 reported <br/>\nroutine co-sleeping that began during the child&#39;s infancy, and 23 said that <br/>\nco-sleeping began around age 1 or later in response to the child&#39;s sleep problems.<br/>\n <br/>\nIntriguingly, mothers reported that preschoolers who began co-sleeping as <br/>\ninfants exhibited more self-reliance and social independence—such as settling <br/>\ndisputes with playmates on their own—than did those who slept alone or started <br/>\nco-sleeping at later ages.<br/>\n <br/>\nCompared with either group of co-sleepers, solitary sleepers displayed <br/>\nseveral signs of greater personal independence.

But I know that they encourage breastfeeding, even with the knowledge that the mother is doing cry it out.  For example, if a breastfeeding mother has strarted doing cry it out with her 3 month old and now is suffering night time engorgement and asks LLL for help in dealing with the engorgement.... (I would have to blurt out, NURSE the child!) but LLL would provide the mother with information on how to deal with engorgement issues.  I distinctly remember going through LLL leader application meetings and hearing veteran leaders say that really, it is every person&#39;s choice and that Leaders are not there to judge, but to offer support for breastfeeding &quot;wherever the mother is.&quot;  They clearly favor AP ways, but a leader said to me that if a new mother only nursed her baby in the hospital and then decided to wean even before her milk came in that LLL would at least celebrate that the child got a day or 2 of colostrum, and would try to help the mother through the engorgement of weaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAPI is somewhat the same way in that we want to welcome anyone and everyone to our meetings and support them in whatever aspects of attachment parenting they are doing.  We do not, however, apologize for continuing to offer information and research about all aspects of AP.  We hope folks are not offended by our doing so, but hey, we are an AP organization.  There will be no mainstream parenting support found there.  So folks can do cry it out if they want, but we aren&#39;t going to tell them it is okay. But we will still welcome them and hope that in time they might become comfortable with co-sleeping or at least responding sensitively to their baby&#39;s cries from hearing our voices on those issues, and from growing comfortable with us as mothers who are normal after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, February 13, 2005 12:57 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Attachment Parenting and Unschooling was: I wish I had known<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-But the point is well taken and understood that LLL is there to support anyone who breastfeeds to whatever extent they do, even if they choose to let their babies cry it out.<br/>\n  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Really?<br/>\n  You think they would &quot;support&quot; that as an organization?<br/>\n  Or do you think leaders would really &quot;support&quot; that?

Obviously their main purpose is to support breastfeeding, and in a non-judgmental way so that parents returning to work will get support they need for pumping, and even those weaning early still receive the info and support they need through LLL, but I don&#39;t think anyone can deny that LLL has a preference on these things.  Reading through the 7th edition of the Womanly Art of Breastfeeding last night I found much encouragement toward the family bed, the ideal is child-led weaning, and there is much emphasis on the nurturing aspects of nursing versus ONLY the nutritional benefits.  Dr. William Sears is a Pediatric advisor and major spokesperson for LLL, and he is also the founder of attachment parenting, and heavily involved with Attachment Parenting International.  His books are numerous on the LLL bibliography.  But the point is well taken and understood that LLL is there to support anyone who breastfeeds to whatever extent they do, even if they choose to let their babies cry it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah Harper<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debbliz@...\">debbliz@...</a><br/>\nMomma to Bethany 6-1-00<br/>\nWife to Tom 7-9-99<br/>\nAPI of the Raleigh Area<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.attachmentparenting.org/\">http://www.attachmentparenting.org/</a><br/>\nPeaceful Parenting for a Peaceful World<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, February 13, 2005 9:57 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Attachment Parenting and Unschooling was: I wish I had known<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-So therefore, La Leche League does not promote/endorse attatchment parenting,-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  They sure were in the late 1980&#39;s, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then, going to work and pumping was the discouraged exception.

As a LLLLeader, I feel the responsibility to clarify La Leche","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-89259551\">Hello--<br/>\nI am Susan, a new lurker here and unschooler and AP parent and La Leche League Leader. <br/>\nAs a LLLLeader, I feel the responsibility to clarify La Leche League&#39;s mission statement which is: to help mothers to breastfeed through mother to mother support, encouragement, information and education and to promote a better understanding of breastfeeding as an important element in the healthy development of the baby and mother. <br/>\nSo therefore, La Leche League does not promote/endorse attatchment parenting, vegetarian or any particular lifestyle but rather states that each mother is the expert on the needs of their own family and they are just there on the breastfeeding side- (ie if a mom chooses to work and put kids in daycare but still wants to breastfeed- La Leche League focuses on helping them make the pumping/breastfeeding work out). La Leche League has ten philosophies that further clarify their purpose and with which leaders must agree, and these do encourage mothers to develop a sensitivity to their child&#39;s needs from pre-birth and early infancy on and that is why some moms who attend LLL and LLLLeaders are led to AP type practice, but it really does vary.<br/>\nSO,  we must be careful when we make sweeping generalizations about the &quot;types&quot; of people who are AP or who even attend La Leche League or those who are LLLLeaders. There is quite a diverse population in all those groups, including many more working moms where LLL used to be mostly SAHM. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a challenge to find someone whose beliefs are exactly in line with yours- I love Jenny&#39;s statement that &quot;I understand that my philosophies in life are just MINE&quot;   TOTALLY!! I  grew up with three sisters and while we are all now LLLLeaders, APparents, Catholic and Homeschoolers - our individual beliefs have led us to very different philosophies within these categories. Our two brothers do things differently in their families too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way- what is &quot;crunchy?&quot;<br/>\nPeace.<br/>\nSusan <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 6 <br/>\n&gt; Date: Fri, 11 Feb 2005 15:45:47 -0700 <br/>\n&gt; From: Jenny Altenbach <br/>\n&gt; Subject: Attachment parenting and Unschooling was: I wish I had known...&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=-I�ve also been going to a local <br/>\n&gt; &gt; attachment parenting group with my husband Joe, so we&#39;re feeling very <br/>\n&gt; &gt; supported in our decisions these days. :-D <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=- <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I never knew until VERY lately (last week or so )that there was <br/>\n&gt; &gt; such a thing as &quot;attachment parenting groups&quot; other than the mentions <br/>\n&gt; &gt; it gets at La Leche League meetings and in conjunction with other things. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; What I heard was not encouraging, either. Seemed the &quot;attachment&quot; was <br/>\n&gt; &gt; kinda one way. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am very much an attachment parent and it is because of AP that <br/>\n&gt; Unschooling is the obvious way to go for us. I would never dissuade <br/>\n&gt; anyone from learning about and practicing attachment parenting. But I <br/>\n&gt; want to address the ways that attachment parenting and unschooling can <br/>\n&gt; sometimes be at odds with each other, at least in the parent&#39;s mind <br/>\n&gt; (they are not at odds with eachother in reality, IMO). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; For me, with La Leche League, it was encouraged that we consider <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ourselves our children&#39;s partners, and that we read The Continuum <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Concept, and not try to press our kids to be separated from us until <br/>\n&gt; &gt; they were good and ready and wanted on their own to walk away a ways <br/>\n&gt; &gt; or to stay at someone else&#39;s house. Sure enough, that worked! It <br/>\n&gt; &gt; worked really, really well. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, this is what AP is all about in its purest sense, and this is the <br/>\n&gt; single concept of AP. Bed sharing, breastfeeding on demand, babywearing <br/>\n&gt; in a sling or soft carrier, responding to baby&#39;s cries, etc. I think <br/>\n&gt; where things get muddy is when you look at the different kinds of people <br/>\n&gt; who are practicing AP. Anyone who does it is necessarily the kind of <br/>\n&gt; person who is willing to think outside the box and go against the <br/>\n&gt; mainstream. So by default a large proportion of those who practice AP <br/>\n&gt; are also against the mainstream in other aspects of their lives: they <br/>\n&gt; are often ultra-crunchy, politically very left, often involved in <br/>\n&gt; spiritual pursuits outside the mainstream, concerned about sustainable <br/>\n&gt; living, and so on. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So when their kids are babies it&#39;s all good because the babies pretty <br/>\n&gt; much have to go along with the philosophy of the parents, which, in our <br/>\n&gt; case, is very heavily influenced by the excesses of our culture, our <br/>\n&gt; disproportionate use of resources, and the military-industrial complex <br/>\n&gt; that drives our society (our choices are based on our opinions about <br/>\n&gt; these things--so for example I don&#39;t shop at Wal-Mart because I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; want to support them, I buy free-trade coffee, etc). I know many other <br/>\n&gt; AP parents who share these values. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Issues of TV and plastic toys and organic juice and t-shirts with <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Disney characters on them never entered into it, and as it was a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; pretty simple philosophical point (not a TON of points, one basic <br/>\n&gt; &gt; principle) nobody could have worked those in and still called it <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;attachment parenting.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So yes, some AP groups may have this kind of flavor. It&#39;s very much the <br/>\n&gt; Mothering Magazine kind of thing--touting all natural toys, organic <br/>\n&gt; foods, cloth diapers, alternative medicine, and abhoring commercialism, <br/>\n&gt; TV, video games, and junk food. And I *have* felt judged in certain <br/>\n&gt; circumstances because I made choices that were not as &quot;alternative&quot; as <br/>\n&gt; others when our babies were young. ***The thing is, many of these AP <br/>\n&gt; moms are complete control freaks because they are trying so hard to <br/>\n&gt; &quot;protect&quot; their kids from mainstream culture. That&#39;s where it conflicts <br/>\n&gt; with unschooling.*** <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I have come to understand is that MY philosophy in life is just <br/>\n&gt; MINE--and that at 4 and 1 my kids can&#39;t possibly feel the same way that <br/>\n&gt; I do about Wal-Mart or sweatshops or oil wars. It&#39;s been hard to realize <br/>\n&gt; that and let go, but I&#39;m so glad I did. In fact, I let my subscription <br/>\n&gt; to Mothering expire because I just don&#39;t have any use for it any more. <br/>\n&gt; Now I buy it as a shower gift for new moms, becasue I do think they are <br/>\n&gt; right on about baby care (although they refuse to print an article on <br/>\n&gt; Elimination Communication, which is really wierd). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; And what&#39;s TRULY weird is when people treat it as a temporary <br/>\n&gt; &gt; philosophy, to be thrown off when a kid is three or five years old. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yeah, that&#39;s what gets me too. There&#39;s a lady who I met in La Leche <br/>\n&gt; League, who is very AP/crunchy but has gone the Waldorf route and her <br/>\n&gt; kids get no TV, no sugar, very few toys, and she is very short tempered <br/>\n&gt; with them when they complain about it. There&#39;s another one I know who <br/>\n&gt; was a huge influence on me (introduced me to extended breastfeeding, <br/>\n&gt; bought me my first subscription to Mothering) and now she is actually <br/>\n&gt; spanking her kids. Another one is dead set against homeschooling, let <br/>\n&gt; alone unschooling. Oh, and they all use time outs and other shaming <br/>\n&gt; types of discipline. One of them actually gave her 5yo daughter a buzz <br/>\n&gt; cut as a punishment for cutting her little brother&#39;s hair! I don&#39;t get it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Once we trusted Kirby and he trusted us, nothing was going to induce <br/>\n&gt; &gt; us to break that bond if we didn&#39;t have to, and that made unschooling <br/>\n&gt; &gt; a snap. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That was my motivation too--not to break that bond. I thank my lucky <br/>\n&gt; stars every day that I discovered unschooling and that I have had the <br/>\n&gt; opportunity to learn from all of you who generously give of yourselves <br/>\n&gt; on this and other forums. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jenny <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
