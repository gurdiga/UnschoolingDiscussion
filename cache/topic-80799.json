He learned to read on his own at <br/>\n7. But he hasn&#39;t been a big &quot;reader.&quot; I went to B&N a month ago <br/>\nto buy some books for my older kids and saw _The Mouse and <br/>\nthe Motorcycle_ on one of the kids&#39; tables. I knew immediately <br/>\nthat would be a book he&#39;d like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t say much about it when I got home. I put it on the kitchen <br/>\ntable and when he asked me about it, I just said, &quot;I saw this book <br/>\nand thought of you. If you want me to read it to you, I will.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLater that day, he told me &quot;I&#39;m going to read it myself, Mom. The <br/>\nwhole thing. I don&#39;t want any help.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd boy, he is doing just that. Each day a little more.

Joe wanted to stop by Barnes and Noble and well the kids had a field day in there. No book for Joe but all 3 little ones sure stocked up. We have been reading chapter books like Goosebumps and Boxcar Children and such. Joseph and Sierra really like them and I always read them to both. At the store, Joseph asked if he could get this Bionicle book he found. He told me he wanted to read it by himself. He&#39;s been reading comic books and small story books and magazines but never a chapter book. Well he&#39;s almost finished and even read it in the car on the way to a friends today! He&#39;s already talking about getting more. It&#39;s so nice to see, he&#39;s having such fun!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80761,"nextTopicId":80812}}
