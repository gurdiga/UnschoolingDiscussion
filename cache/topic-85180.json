I had a good mom, a very loving mom that I provoked past her<br/>\n&gt;ability to cope.  I was abusive to her and she couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  I<br/>\n&gt;never felt that she abused me.....she protected herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I remember a similar incident from when I was around the same age. Yes, I <br/>\n*did* provoke my mild-mannered father into spanking me. No, it wasn&#39;t the <br/>\nbest solution, and he realized it almost right away. (My parents rarely <br/>\nspanked. In fact that&#39;s the only one I remember.)<br/>\nTia<br/>\nWhen I was a late teen my mom and I had a fight where I started storming up <br/>\nthe stairs screaming horrible things to her, when she threw a rather large <br/>\ncoffee table book that she was holding at me. I looked down at her horrified, and <br/>\nboth of us cracked up, then apologized. I don&#39;t think we ever had another <br/>\nout-of-control fight like that again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing about that is, that while we were both out of control and furious, <br/>\nit wasn&#39;t a big adult using the power of size and authority over another. And <br/>\nmy mom didn&#39;t consciously throw that book -- pure reflex.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not advocating that we start hitting or throwing things at our teenager <br/>\n-- just that some of these examples are different.  As Shannon knew, because <br/>\nshe didn&#39;;t WANT to hit her little boy, and asked for help. <br/>\n<br/>\nBrian, you asked about what if your kid does something totally socially <br/>\nunacceptable. Lots of people here have met my son Julian, who, at 14 is a charming <br/>\nand very sweet boy. He&#39;s never  been a difficult kid, and has never been <br/>\nspanked.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time when he was pretty young and very, very angry he did something <br/>\ntruly, horribly, awfully socially unacceptable. (I won&#39;t go into the details, <br/>\nbecause he wouldn&#39;t want me to. Just trust me. It was BAD!)  He wasn&#39;t spanked. He <br/>\nwasn&#39;t even yelled at. The enormity of our disappointment and upset with him <br/>\nwas enough for him to really get it. And nothing like that ever happened again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI work with parents a lot, and I can tell you that the less likely a parent <br/>\nis to spank or otherwise physically or emotionally punish a child, the less <br/>\nlikely that child is to behave badly. I have seen that punishing and spanking <br/>\nmake kids angry and scared and out of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85177,"nextTopicId":85063}}
