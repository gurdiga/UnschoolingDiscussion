They have a bath, story and then lights-out. We do feel <br/>\nlike it is important to have a routine that we can plan around. We can&#39;t <br/>\nreally talk or watch a grownup movie with them around clamoring for food, <br/>\nattention, cartoons, etc. so after 9 would be our time together and as brief <br/>\nas it may be before we collapse exhausted, we do enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10408,"nextTopicId":10236}}
