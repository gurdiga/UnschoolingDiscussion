It is a universal truth that human bodies need food.  One can <br/>\nsay that food is not necessary, that a person can live without food, but <br/>\nthe reality is--if you don&#39;t get food, you will eventually die.  Water <br/>\nis the same thing.  The function of the heart is to move blood through <br/>\nthe body, the function of the lungs is to populate that blood with <br/>\noxygen, and the function of the breast is to provide Human Milk to the <br/>\nhuman infant and child.  Man can develop and has developed an artifical <br/>\nheart and one day they may even have one that allows a person with a bad <br/>\nor malformed heart to live a long full life, but I don&#39;t see people <br/>\nlining up to get one simply because it MUST be better than the heart <br/>\nthey were born with, after all it&#39;s more scientific, you can measure how <br/>\noften and well it beats, etc.  Regardless of your beliefs, if you <br/>\nbelieve in God, or Budha or in nothing, one cannot deny that breasts <br/>\nwere MADE to create milk.  Not for sex, not for billboards, not for <br/>\ntopless dancing.  Therefore it is common sense that regardless of what <br/>\nour society says, human milk is the food for humans and that the <br/>\ncontainer that comes with human milk should not be hidden away.  Do I <br/>\nthink women should walk around topless, no, but I also don&#39;t think men <br/>\nshould walk around topless.  But women should feel free to breastfeed <br/>\ntheir children wherever and however THEY choose to do so and other <br/>\npeople&#39;s opinion should not come into play at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; on and on and on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t agree or disagree on any of it..

While one may not agree<br/>\n&gt; with the premise of such a system, to state that it lacks any historic premise<br/>\n&gt; is not only an invalid statement, but shows complete ignorance of belief<br/>\n&gt; systems shared by many. The fact that you seem to be stating there is lack of<br/>\n&gt; evidence for such a system to exist, as opposed to asking for sources or<br/>\n&gt; simply stating you disagree, seems to make it read as though your statements<br/>\n&gt; are factual when in actuality they are opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A belief doesn&#39;t need to have historial or moral validity to be true. (Nor<br/>\ndoes historical validity make something true.) But you claimed Judie&#39;s did<br/>\nhave historical and moral validity. So what religions or belief systems is<br/>\nit based on?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You asked Judie specifically how far that belief extends? Because although I<br/>\n&gt; do not know Judie&#39;s belief specifically, there are those who believe that we<br/>\n&gt; are each &quot;God&quot;, or an extension of the &quot;Universal Soul&quot; in which case if that<br/>\n&gt; is what Judie believes she then fits your criteria of what predestination is.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So this religion or religions you know of believes we&#39;re each God and before<br/>\nbirth we determine our path on Earth? What religion is that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The fact that those are scientific terms is also about perspective, along with<br/>\n&gt; the separating spirituality from science. Not everyone sees them as separate.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, what I&#39;m saying is you can&#39;t stretch the meaning of scientific terms<br/>\nbeyond their definition and still expect them to have the same worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t use the word evidence and fact to mean belief in something and<br/>\nthen expect it to hold the same power of &quot;proof&quot; as the stricter scientific<br/>\ndefintions of those words. Soft definitions of evidence and fact will yield<br/>\nsoft proofs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Not everyone believes the same facts or the same evidence, if that were true,<br/>\n&gt; no one would wonder if O.J. did it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re confusing evidence and facts with the conclusions based on those.<br/>\nFacts are not something one believes or not believes in. They&#39;re bits of<br/>\nreality. A fact can be a list from the phone company of phone numbers dialed<br/>\nfrom a particular phone number. It can be the bullet recovered from a body.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvidence is bits of reality that suggest a conclusion. From the dictionary<br/>\nat Lawyers.com: Evidence is &quot;something (as testimony, writings, or objects)<br/>\npresented at a judicial or administrative proceeding for the purpose of<br/>\nestablishing the truth or falsity of an alleged matter of fact.&quot; From the<br/>\nfacts and evidence, people will identify patterns. Then they will come up<br/>\nwith a theory (conclusion) that explains why those patterns exist. But a<br/>\ngood theory has to explain *all* the data, not just the supporting pieces<br/>\nsomeone picks out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn trials it&#39;s expected that theories won&#39;t explain everything and that<br/>\nthere will be some contradictory evidence. That&#39;s why juries are instructed<br/>\nto reach a verdict that is free from *reasonable* doubt.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn science scientists -- and the peers who review their data and theories --<br/>\nare well aware of where their theories don&#39;t cover all the data. But they<br/>\ncan&#39;t throw away data they can&#39;t explain or data that refutes their theory.<br/>\nThey work to refine their theories with the goal of explaining all the data<br/>\nand work on better ways to gather more accurate data so their theory can<br/>\nexplain it all. They aren&#39;t under the same time constraints that juries are.<br/>\nThey can spend years gathering data to support or refute a theory.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe things you&#39;re discussing: religion, predestination, astral projection<br/>\nare beyond what science can investigate. That doesn&#39;t mean they are untrue.<br/>\nIt&#39;s just that the words &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;evidence&quot; and &quot;proof&quot; don&#39;t accurately<br/>\ndescribe what people are using to support the theories that these things<br/>\nexist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There would be no need to defend anything<br/>\n&gt; if those who were using inapplicable words would be clear about their intent<br/>\n&gt; and didn&#39;t seem to intend on offending.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sandra used the words correctly. She was just asking *where* that belief<br/>\ncame from. Is it based in some historical religion? Is it totally Judie&#39;s<br/>\nidea?<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither makes an idea more true but a belief system held by millions over<br/>\nhundreds of years at least has lots of people examining and experiencing it<br/>\nfrom many perspectives. The parts that conflict with reality are going to<br/>\nget weeded out. Most people now adays don&#39;t believe in the Egyptian gods but<br/>\nthe Egyptian system of belief explained the observations they had of their<br/>\nlives in that time and place. It is elaborate beyond their reality --<br/>\nnothing told them a god was named Osiris -- but the elaborations didn&#39;t<br/>\nconflict with reality -- nothing in reality said it wasn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nA belief system held by one person only has one person examining it from one<br/>\nperspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething can actually be valid without it being true. As long as it&#39;s<br/>\nconsistent with a belief system, then something is valid *within that belief<br/>\nsystem*. A schizophrenic&#39;s view of the world is &quot;valid&quot; within themselves<br/>\nbut they&#39;re residing in a world of people who don&#39;t see what they see.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople can get philosophical about what is reality but if someone sees a<br/>\nchild being beaten and their &quot;vision of reality&quot; leads them to believe<br/>\nthat&#39;s the child&#39;s chosen path, then they&#39;re having a negative effect on<br/>\nsociety. Their &quot;valid&quot; belief is harmful to others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ooops, I forgot to reply that while it may not be foundationally known as a<br/>\n&gt; part of their belief systems, what I said in my post was that there are<br/>\n&gt; &quot;sects&quot; <br/>\n&gt; of many religions that do accept predestination as a part of their system.<br/>\n&gt; There would be no way to dissect all the religions of the world (or any other<br/>\n&gt; ;-) ). There&#39;s something like 40 thousand different sects to Christianity, so<br/>\n&gt; who knows what religion solely believes in one way and only one way. Some are<br/>\n&gt; far more fundamental than others, but there will always be dissenters.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No need to name them all.

Evidently<br/>\nthey (ie the dark souls) act without the benefit of determining which<br/>\nspiritual lessons they will seeking to learn this time around. I guess<br/>\nthey are the rapists etc. Browne also believes that we each have three<br/>\npredetermined exit points and may choose to leave at any of them on the<br/>\nspur of the moment - other than the final one of course. She asserts<br/>\nthat only the most enlightened of spirits choose to have what seem<br/>\nhorrendous fates, because they have a higher purpose for other folk in<br/>\ntheir spiritual journeys. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t wish to argue with anyone about their spiritual beliefs.

There is no way for me to prove what is truth to you, that is each <br/>\nof our responsibilities to ourselves. I can&#39;t say, &quot;hey Sandra, last night i <br/>\nmet you when I astrally traveled to New Mexico&quot; and have that be your truth. <br/>\nIt could be mine, it could be both of ours where I recall it and you don&#39;t, it <br/>\ncould be we both recall it, in which case the truths would match and we could <br/>\neasily agree.

For no other reason than it makes people <br/>\nuncomfortable about something they do not believe can happen or are afraid of <br/>\nthe consequences of believing in such things. People who are extremely close <br/>\nto me know that I have that ability and some have even &quot;tested&quot; me.

Everything from &quot;Did you have a hidden camera?&quot;, to <br/>\n&quot;Are you doing witchcraft? to &quot;Wow that was cool can you do it again?&quot; Each and <br/>\nevery time there was no question about what I experienced with them, but <br/>\nthere was a question as to their ability to accept it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo while I can&#39;t believe that I just shared my flights with this list and I&#39;m <br/>\nsure freaked some out, I see this argument about Judies beliefs much the same <br/>\nway.
