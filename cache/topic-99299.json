Why is it wrong to ask for respect for the shared space when you are respecting the personal space?  How is that wrong, etc.?<br/>\n <br/>\n***If they packed a box up really well wouldn&#39;t you be able to find a place to store it (shed, basement, store room, under your bed, in the bottom of a shared closet) for when they&#39;re grown?***<br/>\n <br/>\nI can understand this, but you are still talking either shared space or the willingness to share one&#39;s personal space.  Additionally, these aren&#39;t &quot;living&quot; spaces per se.  I guess they could be, but they aren&#39;t traditionally &lt;g&gt;.
