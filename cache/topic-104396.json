I am glad for your post.. it was an inspiration for me. It&#39;s <br/>\nfunny.. because I once was that sort of person.. the most outspoken <br/>\nsupporter of unschooling in a very conservative hm&#39;school group. My family <br/>\nand I have had a tough year, one thing after another. I&#39;m just a bit beat <br/>\ndown lately, and this last hurdle; having to deal with the juvenile dept. <br/>\nwas scary. I have no excuse for not being more confident. We aren&#39;t new <br/>\nunschoolers, I know this is right for my kids. I&#39;ve read almost everything <br/>\nSandra has written and I&#39;ve been a lurker here on the unschooling discussion <br/>\nlist for a while too. I will be at the conference in Oct, and hopefully when <br/>\nit&#39;s over, will feel &quot;armed to the teeth&quot; again too. Anyway I&#39;m saving what <br/>\nyou wrote.
