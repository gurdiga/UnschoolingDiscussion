My daughter <br/>\nwas on it for a year. Also along with counseling too. She had never been on <br/>\nanything before either and was very apprehensive about going on it. She <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like to take any kind of meds really. She had no problems with it at <br/>\nall. It worked very well and after a year she was able to go off of it and <br/>\nhas so far been fine. It&#39;s been about 3 months or so since she hasn&#39;t been <br/>\ntaking it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?

The first few days I had a bit of an upset stomach, but that&#39;s all.  I was fatigued and no use to anyone BEFORE the Celexa.  I have never had any problems with depression before, but this year was different.  I didn&#39;t like myself.  I cried ALOT.  I rarely, maybe never, had a good day.  I felt like my kids and husband were getting cheated big time because I just wasn&#39;t myself.  I felt like my life was one big chore, I never smiled or laughed anymore.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have my old self back.  I laugh, make jokes, play with my kids.  I have so much more energy and don&#39;t mind doing chores now that life is more than that.  And I&#39;m enjoying playing with my husband again now, which had also become a chore :-(    Although I&#39;ve never been on an anti-depressant before, I would recommend this one, but I can&#39;t compare it to others.  My doc said it would rebalance the seratonin etc in my brain which had gotten out of whack due to the unusual amount of weirdness going on in my life all at once.
