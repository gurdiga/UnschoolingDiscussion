She has serious <br/>\nspelling difficulties. She reads extremely well - even technical <br/>\nmaterial - can read out loud and pronounce difficult words she&#39;s never <br/>\nseen before - so her poor spelling is not a result of weak knowledge of <br/>\nphonics. She reads and writes a LOT - her poor spelling doesn&#39;t slow <br/>\ndown her writing - she just writes anyway and then gets someone to <br/>\ncorrect her spelling later.  Her spelling is extremely poor, though - <br/>\nshe spells the same word different ways in the same body of writing, <br/>\nshe sometimes adds and often omits letters, and nearly always mixes up <br/>\nthe order of letters that should be there. In a sentence like this one, <br/>\nshe would have misspelled at least four words. Her misspellings often <br/>\nare so far off that it is difficult to figure out what word she meant.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer poor spelling hasn&#39;t really been a problem until a couple of days <br/>\nago when she did &quot;Horsemastership&quot; testing at 4H and took what was <br/>\ncalled &quot;orals&quot; - a test of her knowledge about horses. Turned out it <br/>\nwas not &quot;oral&quot; - they took four kids at a time and the kids had to <br/>\nanswer questions by filling in the blanks on an answer sheet. My <br/>\ndaughter skipped a number of questions, even though she knew the <br/>\nanswers, because she couldn&#39;t manage to spell them well enough for them <br/>\nto be recognizable (there was some time pressure, too - she could hear <br/>\nthat there were a lot of other kids waiting outside to get in and get <br/>\ntheir testing done). She got blue ribbons in the other four tests <br/>\n(grooming, showmanship, equitation, and trail riding) and a red ribbon <br/>\non the written one - so if she hadn&#39;t had spelling problems, she&#39;d have <br/>\npossibly had all five blue ribbons, which is quite a remarkable <br/>\naccomplishment and she&#39;d have been really really thrilled. (Four blues <br/>\nand a red is a great accomplishment too and she was thrilled by that - <br/>\nbut it does seem too bad that poor spelling played a part in the <br/>\noutcome.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, if she&#39;s at a loss as to how to spell a word, she makes a <br/>\nlist of a bunch of ways it might be spelled, and then she can look at <br/>\nthe list and pick out the correct one. If I give her a list - say I <br/>\ngive her &quot;flwer,&quot; &quot;fwler,&quot; &quot;floer,&quot; &quot;flowr,&quot; and &quot;flower&quot; -- she can <br/>\nalways recognize the correct one. This is nice, but when she&#39;s having <br/>\ntrouble with so MANY words, this really isn&#39;t a feasible strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - this seems to be a very very specific inability to &quot;output&quot; <br/>\ncorrectly spelled words.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anybody has any suggestions, we&#39;d love to hear them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\npam<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - I&#39;m going to send this post to a few lists, looking for help, so I <br/>\napologize to those who get it more than once.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71011,"nextTopicId":70651}}
