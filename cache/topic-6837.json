PLEASE make sure that the article you are passing<br/>\nare actually true. Urban legends are very easy to believe, and I know I have<br/>\nfallen prey to such enticing ideas. Currently we are experiencing a gasoline<br/>\ncrisis. I know that it is hard on everyone to pay up to (and over) $1.50 a<br/>\ngallon of gasoline. BUT the GAS OUT article that is circulating the lists is<br/>\nan urban legend. Just go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://4urbanlegends.com\">http://4urbanlegends.com</a> and you will find it in<br/>\ntheir archives. Or you can search through your ISP and find a different<br/>\nsite.<br/>\n    Seriously, the only way to lower gasoline prices is to STOP USING<br/>\nGASOLINE for your main form of travel. Start carpooling, only going to the<br/>\nstore once a week/month, pick and choose what you need instead of what you<br/>\nwant. Get out that bike that has been collecting bust since you fell off<br/>\nthat exercise kick. Walk. hey, I understand.<br/>\n    I love the comfort of my van, and the ability to dress in sweats and RUN<br/>\nfrom the house to the van, turn the key, blast the heat, run to the house,<br/>\nwarm up, and then run back to a heated vehicle. BUT, I too, am looking at<br/>\nthe gas station 3 blocks from my front door and going &quot;Not me, not until the<br/>\nprices fall.&quot;<br/>\n    So, I have pulled out my bike. I have even gotten out the trailer for<br/>\nthe children (the one that has not been opened since I bought it) and I will<br/>\nBIKE the 7 blocks to Krogers, the 12 blocks to pick up the children, and<br/>\neven the 25 blocks to rent a movie. And, yes, I will even put on my spring<br/>\ncoat to do it.<br/>\n    Hey, then I am doing two rights for my country. I am banning gasoline,<br/>\nand I am banning the extra weight that is sneaking up on my hips.<br/>\n    Point to all of this. We need to get up and do something, not just pass<br/>\nan email that is not true to everyone. So, do it today!<br/>\nStephanie<br/>\nRon and Stephanie<br/>\nLife&#39;s Learnings Academy<br/>\nWe REALLY get involved with our children&#39;s studies-<br/>\nWe&#39;re Homeschoolers!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6834,"nextTopicId":6839}}
