It was <br/>\n&gt;a bittersweet victory for the Irish, because although they were happy to get <br/>\n&gt;the majority of their country back, England still had a piece of it, and the <br/>\n&gt;Irish people (mostly Catholic) want the WHOLE country back and the English <br/>\n&gt;(mostly Protestants) OUT.  That is why the warring is centered on Ulster and <br/>\n&gt;mostly, Belfast.  It is a religious war, a race war, a poor against the rich <br/>\n&gt;war...As long as England holds a piece of Ireland as theirs, it will probably be a <br/>\n&gt;never ending war.

The Council of Nicea made it up and voted on it.&quot; That is <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; bogus. The first Christians believed in the resurrection of Jesus <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Christ and spread that news with fervor and boldness.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; According to books which were copied from books which were already <br/>\n </span></blockquote>aged <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; copies when the Catholics who voted got ahold of them?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One little fact we must keep in mind: the copies of Biblical <br/>\ndocuments, though there are scads of them, have little to NO <br/>\ndifferences between them. When there is a difference, it will be in <br/>\nsomething like a marginal note, never in major doctrines and <br/>\nteachings. IOW, that 1st century fragment of John&#39;s Gospel reads just <br/>\nexactly like one from the 5th century, and ancient church copies from <br/>\nthe 12th century as well, show no errors of any magnitude. The words <br/>\nof the Bible were copied with great care by people who loved them. <br/>\nAny objective scholar will acknowledge that Biblical documentation is <br/>\namong the best, if not THE best, in existence.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=-The Puritans tried to rename the days of the week, even. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hadn&#39;t heard that!

The Irish people were forever trying to get their <br/>\ncountry back, and all the English out, warring constantly.  There was finally a sort <br/>\nof truce/decision made in (I believe?) the 1940&#39;s, in which most of the <br/>\ncountry would no longer be ruled by England, but in turn part of Northern Ireland <br/>\n(Ulster) would remain under England&#39;s rule, part of the United Kingdom.  It was <br/>\na bittersweet victory for the Irish, because although they were happy to get <br/>\nthe majority of their country back, England still had a piece of it, and the <br/>\nIrish people (mostly Catholic) want the WHOLE country back and the English <br/>\n(mostly Protestants) OUT.  That is why the warring is centered on Ulster and <br/>\nmostly, Belfast.  It is a religious war, a race war, a poor against the rich <br/>\nwar...As long as England holds a piece of Ireland as theirs, it will probably be a <br/>\nnever ending war.  Each year in Belfast the English/Irish Protestants hold an <br/>\n&quot;Orange&quot; parade.  And every year, there&#39;s usually another battle sparked by it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Antiquity and getting facts  clearly clear","postDate":"1068161621","msgId":84073,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwMzExMDYxNTMzMDMuMDI1YjYxMDBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGI4LjRhYTllY2E1LjJjZGMzMGU0QGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGI4LjRhYTllY2E1LjJjZGMzMGU0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":84067,"nextInTopic":84089,"prevInTime":84072,"nextInTime":84074,"topicId":84043,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The church holidy had nothing to do with scary graveyard  &quot;ooooh&quot; <br/>\ncandles in turnips stuff, but it was in the same season, so already existing <br/>\ntraditions were set on the same day every year, which was named by the church <br/>\ncalendar.<br/>\n<br/>\nHallowe&#39;en is All Hallow&#39;s Eve(ning).  <br/>\nLike Christmas Eve is Christmas Eve.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsed to be a day started at sundown the day before.  The day ended at dark, <br/>\nnot at midnight.  So the evening of one&#39;s birthday was the eve of one&#39;s <br/>\nbirthday, the night before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;e&#39;en&quot; which has pretty much dropped its apostrophe (still required in <br/>\nspelling bees in the 1960&#39;s) is short for evening, abbreviated to the way it was <br/>\npronunced when the spelling settled.<br/>\n<br/>\nIreland was Catholic, and is, but there were still some local things that <br/>\npeople did which the church adapted instead of banning.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;For some of it at least, the traditions began <br/>\n<br/>\nafter Christianity came to an area...not already there and made into <br/>\n<br/>\nChristian holidays by the church...&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven so, it wouldn&#39;t mean the church made the decisions or that they were <br/>\ncelebrating something churchish.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s traditional in northern New Mexico to make biscochitos at Christmas.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re anise-seed cookies made with brandy.  They have nothing to do with <br/>\nreligion, but they&#39;re always there at Christmas dinners and Christmas sales and <br/>\nsuch.  There are lots of things like that.  Luminarias and little fires on <br/>\nChristmas eve.  There&#39;s an adaptation of a local Indian tradition to build <br/>\ncross-piece pyres of split cedar, two sticks one way, two the other, and so on, about <br/>\ntwo feet high.  They&#39;re lit at dark on Christmas Eve.  I think it was done <br/>\nbefore the Catholics came, and since it was done on the darkest night, they <br/>\nattached it to Christmas and justified it (blessed it, kind of) that way.  It&#39;s <br/>\nstill done.   We lived across the Rio Grande from Santa Clara Pueblo, and on <br/>\nChristmas Eve if it was still there would be dozens of straight-up plumes of black <br/>\nsmoke all at once.  It looked COOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s Christmas tradition, but it isn&#39;t &quot;Christian in origin.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83679,"nextTopicId":83912}}
