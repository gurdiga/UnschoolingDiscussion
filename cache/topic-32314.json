They enjoy watching the show. I don&#39;t really mind it too much. And they don&#39;t really &quot;tell&quot; me to watch. If I were not watching it, I would be on the computer, or doing dishes, reading a book, in other words, doing something by myself. At night when these shows are on, it is somewhat customary for us in our family to &quot;gather round the tv&quot;. Kind of like family tv time. I know for a fact DH appreciates me sitting next to him, sharing a few laughs or a few &quot;eeewwws&quot; after he has been away all day at work. Or if I&#39;m not sitting next to him, my youngest son is laying on me or next to me or having some physical contact with me. If I were not there watching, they would come to me at every commercial or after the show and tell me exactly what happened and all the details. They would be dissapointed that I hadn&#39;t shared in their excitement.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere aren&#39;t really any shows or programming that we don&#39;t see together. DH does not even like sports, in fact he hates watching it. Just another bonus for me! The kids don&#39;t really get into sports watching either. Though, when the Diamondbacks won the world series last year, we were faithfully watching for a while! As far as the kids shows, sometimes I do watch with them, sometimes not. If I&#39;m in the room while Spongebob Squarepants is on, I&#39;ll admit to laughing if I&#39;m following the story. That&#39;s a pretty funny show! I also like Doug, Hey Arnold!, Rugrats (occasionally), Wild Thornberries, Arthur, Zoom, and probably a few others.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nrumpleteasermom wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Karin&quot; &lt;curtkar@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; They watch it faithfully <br/>\nand are so disappointed if I am not sitting there with them watching <br/>\nit too.

As far as &#39;Trading Spaces&quot; with a neighbor: we could not do it anyway because we are renting this house.

We somehow missed the one recently on FOX, some disgusting eating contest or something. Oh and the Guiness World of Records show is always guaranteed to gross me out but provide huge entertain value for my 3 boys! (2 kids and DH). But I think they love Fear Factor the most. They watch it faithfully and are so disappointed if I am not sitting there with them watching it too. So I do what I must to please them. :-) For any who are interested, it&#39;s on Monday nights at 7:00, NBC and yes, we watched it last night. Disgusting and EEEWWWW!! with the cockroaches on the head! Also one we must never miss is Survivor. They can do some gross things on that show, too.
