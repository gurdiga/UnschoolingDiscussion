On train rides, when you buy<br/>\na cup of chai in one of these cups, you can just throw the cup out the<br/>\nwindow of the train when you are finished. Everyone does it. They also have<br/>\nplates made out of dried banana leaves. Fresh banana leaves are used a lot<br/>\ntoo as plates. Brilliant, if you ask me. At most tea stands glasses are<br/>\nused. A chai is about 5 cents or so. You sit and drink and when you are done<br/>\nreturn the glass to the chai wallah who washes it. I don&#39;t think I ever had<br/>\nany beverage in a paper or plastic cup in India the whole 6 months I was<br/>\nthere. Oh, they did have mango juice boxes and water in plastic bottles, but<br/>\nthese were the exception. Soft drinks were always in glass bottles that one<br/>\nreturned after drinking. Oh yes, and spicy nuts in newspaper cones. This was<br/>\nnine years ago, so maybe things have changed by now. I hope not. I was<br/>\nalways amazed by food containers of all sorts when I was there. Everyone had<br/>\nthese stainless steel lunch boxes that were essentially a pile of 4 or 5<br/>\nbowls on top of one another with a stainless steel metal band that snapped<br/>\ntight. People would carry 5- course meals in these things. And there was so<br/>\nmuch natural recycling. I literally saw one tea wallah making tea in what<br/>\nlooked like an old paint can. One of my favorite treats were made to order<br/>\nomelets right at the train station made on a sort of wok with a real fire<br/>\nunderneath. I can&#39;t remember what they were served on. Oh, and coconut water<br/>\nright out of the coconut. Wow. I don&#39;t think I ever saw a vending machine<br/>\nthe whole time I was there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarrie ( Ruben, age 4 and Sita, 22 months)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112599,"nextTopicId":112758}}
