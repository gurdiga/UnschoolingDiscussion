Children brought to the schools as young as age<br/>\n<br/>\nsix were denied most or all direct contact with their families and societies<br/>\n<br/>\nfor years on end. They were shorn of their hair and required to dress in the<br/>\n<br/>\nmanner of Euro-America, forbidden to speak their languages or practice their<br/>\n<br/>\nreligions, prevented from learning their own histories or being in any other<br/>\n<br/>\nway socialized among their own people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIndividual native families and, often, whole societies resisted the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1891, and again in 1893, Congress authorized the use of police, troops<br/>\n<br/>\nand other forcible means to compel the transfer of children from reservation<br/>\n<br/>\nto boarding school, and to keep them there once they&#39;d arrived. Hence,<br/>\n<br/>\ndespite the best efforts of their elders, and not infrequently of the<br/>\n<br/>\nstudents themselves, a total of 21,568 indigenous children--about a third of<br/>\n<br/>\nthe targeted age group-were confined in the schools in 1900.

The end of the Gold Rush era<br/>\n<br/>\nsignaled a change in U.S. policy towards Native people. Instead of directly<br/>\n<br/>\nkilling California indigenous people, reservations were created and<br/>\n<br/>\nindigenous people were re-located to them. The children were taken, often by<br/>\n<br/>\nforce, away from their parents and to far-away re-education centers.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren as young as four attended these re-education centers. They were<br/>\n<br/>\nforced to cut their hair and give up their clothing upon arrival.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren could not have visitors, including their parents, while they stayed<br/>\n<br/>\nat the centers. Some children stayed for years at a time. Indian children<br/>\n<br/>\nwere often farmed out as free labor to white settlers in boarding school<br/>\n<br/>\ncommunities, and sometimes sold outright at auctions held by boarding school<br/>\n<br/>\nteachers.&quot;  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.originalvoices.org/USGovtRolesSix.htm\">http://www.originalvoices.org/USGovtRolesSix.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You know how I was raised?

Following<br/>\n<br/>\nPratt&#39;s stated objective of &quot;killing the Indian&quot; in each student, Carlisle<br/>\n<br/>\nand other such facilities-Chilocco, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Haskell,<br/>\n<br/>\nRiverside; by 1902, there were two-dozen of thern-systematically<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;deculturated&quot; their pupils. Children brought to the schools as young as age<br/>\n<br/>\nsix were denied most or all direct contact with their families and societies<br/>\n<br/>\nfor years on end. They were shorn of their hair and required to dress in the<br/>\n<br/>\nmanner of Euro-America, forbidden to speak their languages or practice their<br/>\n<br/>\nreligions, prevented from learning their own histories or being in any other<br/>\n<br/>\nway socialized among their own people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIndividual native families and, often, whole societies resisted the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1891, and again in 1893, Congress authorized the use of police, troops<br/>\n<br/>\nand other forcible means to compel the transfer of children from reservation<br/>\n<br/>\nto boarding school, and to keep them there once they&#39;d arrived. Hence,<br/>\n<br/>\ndespite the best efforts of their elders, and not infrequently of the<br/>\n<br/>\nstudents themselves, a total of 21,568 indigenous children--about a third of<br/>\n<br/>\nthe targeted age group-were confined in the schools in 1900. As of the late<br/>\n<br/>\n1920s, the system had been diversified and expanded to the point that<br/>\n<br/>\nupwards of eighty percent of each successive generation of native youth was<br/>\n<br/>\nbeing comprehensively &quot;acculturated&quot; in a more-or-less uniform fashion.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zmag.org/ZMag/articles/jan98ward.htm\">http://www.zmag.org/ZMag/articles/jan98ward.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;According to many observers, the regimen of the schools usually included<br/>\n<br/>\ngetting Indians to dress, speak, and act like white people (see for example,<br/>\n<br/>\nWhiteman, 1986).&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;At that time Indians were not U.S. citizens, and they lacked the right to<br/>\n<br/>\ncontrol their own lives and the education of their children (Eder & Reyhner,<br/>\n<br/>\n1988; Whiteman, 1986).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n://www.zmag.org/ZMag/articles/jan98ward.htm<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Indian Commissioner Thomas J.
