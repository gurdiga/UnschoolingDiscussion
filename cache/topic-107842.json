The school is full of teacher-friends of ours, we&#39;re not worried about taking her out to <br/>\nhomeschool again.  They know we&#39;ve been unschooling and most are supportive of our <br/>\ndecision - they think we&#39;re weird, but they like us anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  We&#39;ve tried the homeschool group thing - it&#39;s exclusive and I&#39;ve been warned off it by <br/>\nmore than a few people.  And there don&#39;t really seem to be any other homeschoolers <br/>\naround us.  We&#39;ve even tried to next closest town for homeschool friends, but it&#39;s VERY far <br/>\nand with gas prices the way they are and my husband making the salary he does right <br/>\nnow, it&#39;s out of the question.  My kids do have friends, but they are all public school kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  It&#39;s more than just &quot;her friend is going to school.&quot;  Some one else wrote in that she&#39;s <br/>\nsurprised that more unschoolers don&#39;t want to try school.  That&#39;s it here - she sees school <br/>\neverywhere - in the books we read, on tv, her friends, everywhere.  She just is curious as <br/>\nto what it&#39;s about.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  I wrote in here number of years ago about her wanting to try kindergarden.  She did <br/>\nand she hated it.  She lasted a day.  This may last a little longer, but so what?  She&#39;s an <br/>\nunschooler - it&#39;s her decision and we&#39;re here to support her.<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  She knows that she&#39;s welcome to leave whenever she want to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo thanks for the unput.
