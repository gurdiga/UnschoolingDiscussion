I&#39;ve always wondered about these <br/>\nfolk who get pregnant while they&#39;re on the pill or something and <br/>\ndon&#39;t notice cos they never had periods anyway.

But anyway, how are they doing?  <br/>\nNow that&#39;s some kind of home-birth!!!  LOL  And the Pastor?  Is <br/>\nhe out of shock yet?  Ya know, that&#39;s really the way to do it, isn&#39;t <br/>\nit?  no fuss, no worry, no stress.  Just go to the toilet and get a <br/>\nbaby instead!  now that&#39;s what I need, instead of what I&#39;ve got <br/>\natm :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nStop rambling, woman!
