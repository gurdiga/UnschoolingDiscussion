It wasn&#39;t &quot;they&#39;ll like me best,&quot; but  &quot;don&#39;t <br/>\nyou want them to like you and want to come to you with problems?&quot;   And if he <br/>\nheard it as &quot;they&#39;ll like me best,&quot; oh well.  I do remember  asking him if he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to do differently than his parents did, and I told  him when I&#39;m <br/>\nnot careful I hear my own mom coming out of my mouth, so we should  both be <br/>\ncareful and conscious and be KIRBY&#39;s parents, not OUR parents.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was probably in some antagonistic moment of frustration, but whatever it  <br/>\nwas, it did help. <br/>\n <br/>\nOn the other hand, with kids all teens, the other day when Keith was  working <br/>\non taxes (and becoming his parents, as he does during tax prep, because  they <br/>\ndid his taxes for many years and it&#39;s &quot;just math&quot; on one hand a total  <br/>\nreversion to family of origin on the big mean hand)...  Keith yelled at me  about <br/>\nbeing tired of me not understanding our finances better and for 14 years  he&#39;s <br/>\nhad no say in how the kids are raised.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOh, really? <br/>\nNo, that was his mom speaking through him.  <br/>\nJust an hour or two before that he had been saying Marty was a great kid,  <br/>\ndoing really well, when I was discussing whether I should press a  <br/>\npolice-department-volunteer  thing he&#39;s said &quot;When I&#39;m sixteen...&quot; about or  just let it <br/>\nslide, as he&#39;s really busy lately and not as interested as he once  was.

My dh still wants to be obeyed when <br/>\nhe announces Clean up, or Bedtime.  He still makes comments like, &quot; I told you <br/>\nI didn&#39;t want you playing that Gameboy all day.&quot;  Luckily, I&#39;m around most of <br/>\nthe time and can temper his comments.  At first he resented my stepping in; <br/>\nhe felt I was undermining his authority and insulting his parenting.  We&#39;ve <br/>\neven had a few blow ups, but I think he&#39;s starting to understand it.  He can see <br/>\nthat my gentler method, which respects the childrens&#39; wishes and gives them <br/>\ntime to transition, produces slower but MUCH pleasanter results.  He&#39;s stopped <br/>\nstressing about bedtimes as much, and I see him experimenting with my technique <br/>\nonce in a while, which really warms my heart.  He&#39;s really a terrific, <br/>\ninvolved, and loving father, he&#39;s just a little stuck in his ways.  I now feel <br/>\nconfident he will come around all together, just as he did with the academic part <br/>\nof unschooling.<br/>\n    So, my advice: keep modeling your way, try not to blow up(not easy) when <br/>\nhe uses those knee jerk responses, and find quiet times to explain your <br/>\nmethod.  And remember to empathize that this must be a big scary change for him.  I <br/>\nbecame a very different person and parent over the course of a couple months.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s a lot for any spouse to adjust to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] On the same page","postDate":"1110780603","msgId":104471,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PGQxMzZ0Zys5Y201QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":104465,"nextInTopic":104481,"prevInTime":104470,"nextInTime":104472,"topicId":104465,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2049725109\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My husband agrees with the theory/philosophy in academics, but is <br/>\ninclined to hoot and holler at too much Tv or things not picked up <br/>\nwhen *we* say so.
