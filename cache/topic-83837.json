But they told her what it was that she knew so<br/>\n&gt; little about, and they demonstrated, zipping on up to the times TWELVE <br/>\n&gt; they knew<br/>\n&gt; (way better than the nine or ten limit of public schools).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So Jody was up with them and getting the pattern on the elevens and <br/>\n&gt; twelves,<br/>\n&gt; and said &quot;What about 13?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They didn&#39;t have to know 13.  It wasn&#39;t so fun anymore. Jody told me <br/>\n&gt; she was<br/>\n&gt; multiplying by 14 when they finally got her to stop.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I imagine she was thinking of how very easy fifteens would be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But &quot;times fifteen&quot; won&#39;t be on the test.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This summer Kirby was overheard explaining to some other teens at the <br/>\n&gt; gaming<br/>\n&gt; shop how to multiply by 18.  Do it by 20, and subtract two for each <br/>\n&gt; one you<br/>\n&gt; have.  No pencil, no paper, and the school-labeled &quot;learning <br/>\n&gt; disadvantaged&quot;<br/>\n&gt; friend totally understood. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The adults who overheard this expressed amazement.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other homeschoolers who heard about it were amazed that adults had <br/>\n&gt; been<br/>\n&gt; amazed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps knowing the times tables, &quot;doing&quot; the times tables, is a magic <br/>\n&gt; safety<br/>\n&gt; from further math trauma.  &quot;I know my times tables&quot; is like &quot;King&#39;s X&quot; <br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; being tagged by the math monster.  My kids think math is a tool and a <br/>\n&gt; toy and a<br/>\n&gt; game.  Why would they want to be saved from it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;We don&#39;t have to know that&quot; isn&#39;t anything I have ever heard my children<br/>\n&gt; say.  Because there is nothing they –do- &quot;have to learn,&quot; there is <br/>\n&gt; nothing that<br/>\n&gt; is off their learning list either.  In artistic terms, without the <br/>\n&gt; object there<br/>\n&gt; is no field.  In math-lingo, they have the infinite universal set.  In a<br/>\n&gt; philosophical light, they avoid the dualism of learning and <br/>\n&gt; not-learning. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you are new to math in the wild, I have some recommendations of things<br/>\n&gt; that worked well for us.  First, don&#39;t be teacherly about any of <br/>\n&gt; this.  Don&#39;t use<br/>\n&gt; the talking-to-a-poodle voice (and if you don&#39;t have one or don&#39;t know <br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m talking about, GOOD!).  Then, gradually gather some subset of this <br/>\n&gt; sort of<br/>\n&gt; math stuff, plus other things it might remind you of: <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - two or more matching geoboards and colored rubber bands (you could <br/>\n&gt; get just<br/>\n&gt; one, but then you can&#39;t copy each other&#39;s designs)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - pattern blocks, even if your kids are older (we have the wooden ones <br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; the yellow hexagons being the biggest), because there are angles to <br/>\n&gt; mess and<br/>\n&gt; because it&#39;s very soothing<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Cuisenaire rods if you can get them for less than full price (or if <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; rich), but don&#39;t worry about the &quot;real&quot; exercises<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Yahtzee, Bazaar, Master Mind for Kids(cuter, friendlier, simpler <br/>\n&gt; version<br/>\n&gt; than adult Master Mind), playing cards, poker chips (not necessarily <br/>\n&gt; for playing<br/>\n&gt; poker, just for messing around with, making patterns), and Clue (Kirby <br/>\n&gt; says<br/>\n&gt; there is a new D&D Clue game out.  We have the Simpsons version.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - real money to spend<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - computer and video games like  Zoombinis, KidPix, Harvest Moon, <br/>\n&gt; Mario, Link<br/>\n&gt; & Zelda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - don&#39;t discourage Magic, Pokemon or other &quot;CCG&#39;s&quot; (collectible card <br/>\n&gt; games);<br/>\n&gt; D&D and other dice games involve much math and strategy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other day in my kitchen I said, &quot;Hey, Kirby, I might make $100 for an<br/>\n&gt; article on you teaching someone to multiply by 18, and you didn&#39;t even <br/>\n&gt; know I<br/>\n&gt; overheard you talking about it, so I&#39;ll give you $10.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Cool.  10%.
