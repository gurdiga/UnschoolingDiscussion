It is entirely possible<br/>\n(and done in schools and school-at-home families every day) to suck the joy<br/>\nout of learning to read (or anything else), sometimes to the point where the<br/>\nchild simply refuses on every level to have anything to do with something<br/>\nthat is being made to be a torture.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also very likely that if an unschooled child lived somewhat isolated<br/>\nin a non-reading family that also banned video games and television (because<br/>\nthere is so much reading involved in both those media outlets these days)<br/>\nthey would not learn to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading isn&#39;t Athena, springing full-sized from the head of Zeus in a ta-da!<br/>\noverblown Greek romance. It&#39;s simply as natural as learning to ride a bike<br/>\nin a bike-riding family, or learn to train a dog in a dog-training family,<br/>\nor learn to cook in a family that eats their meals at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79406,"nextTopicId":79357}}
