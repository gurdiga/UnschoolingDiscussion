They are fulfilling <br/>\nrequirements, not loving family members.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved your whole post Julie...very inspirational!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just have to share the latest at my house. My dh has always been a major neat freak and really can&#39;t stand our chaotic methods. Our solution was to make a space for him that is his own, completely separate so he can have peace/quiet/cleanliness that he desires.<br/>\nBut the upstairs still bugged him. He would quietly fume about it OR occasionally grump about the mess.<br/>\nAll of the sudden, THIS week, he had the epiphany. He told me that he realized that most of the problem was I didn&#39;t have enough help and instead of bugging the kids about it, he should just help me.<br/>\nWOW! Very cool.<br/>\nSo he&#39;s been helping out more. And when he was sweeping the floor a couple days ago and I thanked him, he said &quot;well, it bugs me so I should be the one to take care of it.&quot;<br/>\nWell knock me over with a feather! I just stood there with my mouth open. The unschooling philosophies are invading every corner of his brain, how totally amazing. HE GETS IT!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80557,"nextTopicId":80710}}
