Granted, the first 3 years in a child&#39;s life are vital for their development and stimulation is good for them. But I don&#39;t think they necessarily need this &quot;intellectual&quot; kind of stimulation. I believe children develop fantasy and imagination first, which help them integrate their environment and later the world at large, so they should have plenty of *material* to promote and enhace that, but most importantly at that young age they need to be NURTURED and loved and stimulated emotionally. They need to bond with their parents and close family and feel safe in the world.<br/>\nLater come more imagination and creativity, as they develop more abilities to do and create things, along with further development of physical abilities. It is not until later on (6-7 years) that the intellectual abilities develop and children are *ready* to learn to read, write and comprehend concepts in a less intuitive way, and in a more intellectual manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, this *early education* stuff, with all their products and gimmicks, is nothing but an unnecessary *rushing* into things that would come naturally at a later stage. It just seems that this culture has a really hard time accepting the fact that children are not &quot;little adults&quot; that are already &quot;pre-programmed for society.&quot; Sometimes I wonder, when I look at your average parent, why they act toward their kids as if they SHOULD already know what the parent does not have the patience to teach or at least let them learn, and they get so frustrated with the child&#39;s trial-and-error kind of response...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s society&#39;s rush, rush rush... You&#39;re born, you should be reading right away and then to school and then become part of the working force. What about JUST being a baby, then a toddler, then a kid, and live, feel, think and dream JUST like a kid?<br/>\nWell, someone out there must be making big bucks with all this gimmick. And if not, some parents out there must be inflating their egos with their young kids&#39; accomplishments...<br/>\n<br/>\nI truly believe that learning to read is like learning to talk... it comes naturally, but at its own time, when the child is ready. What&#39;s the rush anyway? Why try to train them like animals? The longer a child maintains his or her innocence and &quot;magical&quot; approach at life, the more s/he will be able to preserve and maintain his or her sense of inner Self.<br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I received a question the other day about early childhood learning,<br/>\n&gt; inquiring whether Home Education Magazine had published any articles<br/>\n&gt; on the topic of very early childhood learning. I replied that I<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t recall any, to which the writer, who has so far only<br/>\n&gt; identified himself as Marsh, replied: &quot;I am talking about the whole<br/>\n&gt; issue of nature vs. nurture as it relates to tots and toddlers. In<br/>\n&gt; other words, will early environmental stimulation increase a young<br/>\n&gt; child&#39;s intelligence, and if so, by how much? I am curious if this<br/>\n&gt; whole issue was ever presented to homeschoolers. I can tell you that<br/>\n&gt; most educators have no use whatsoever for it and will say most<br/>\n&gt; anything to dissuade parents from it. Among their other objections,<br/>\n&gt; they equate early parental instruction as early home schooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I have personally been involved with this for 21 years, ever since I<br/>\n&gt; started to teach my two year old how to read.

I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; always believed there was a direct correlation between early social<br/>\n&gt; and mental stimulation (not necessarily &#39;schoolwork&#39; per se, but<br/>\n&gt; loving and supportive interaction between parent and child) and later<br/>\n&gt; learning abilities, and I&#39;ve often wondered why there&#39;s still a<br/>\n&gt; strong perception that &quot;learning&quot; is something that should start<br/>\n&gt; happening around the age when children would normally go off to<br/>\n&gt; school. I know most homeschoolers know better, that children are<br/>\n&gt; learning from birth (and perhaps even before) but still, most of the<br/>\n&gt; articles we receive are directed toward a sort of &quot;parallel school<br/>\n&gt; age&quot; group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Marsh&#39;s no-nonsense approach to the topic of very early childhood<br/>\n&gt; learning makes me wonder why the whole subject hasn&#39;t received more<br/>\n&gt; discussion.

(Type &quot;infant stim&quot; and &quot;infant stimulation&quot; into Google. I see<br/>\nthat you can even download graphics for the computer to stimulate your<br/>\ninfant.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the idea that the first 3 years are important is a good one. Not<br/>\nnecessarily because there&#39;s something specifically vital to a child&#39;s mental<br/>\ngrowth happening (maybe there is, maybe there isn&#39;t) but because, as you<br/>\npoint out, learning doesn&#39;t start at school age.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think parents are taking the early infant learning with a grain of<br/>\nsalt because babies aren&#39;t embracing the idea that their early learning can<br/>\nbe bought at a store ;-) And this society is very ... I&#39;m not sure of the<br/>\nword, but perhaps process? oriented. People don&#39;t find an activity<br/>\nsatisfying unless there&#39;s a clearly defined process with a clearly defined<br/>\nresult at the end.

They don&#39;t trust that what the baby enjoys is what is best for<br/>\nthe baby. They want experts to tell them the right process so they can just<br/>\ndo it. They don&#39;t want to be told to sing and read and play and cuddle and<br/>\nlaugh. They want to know what to do and how long to do it and what results<br/>\nthey can expect. The goal of whole healthy happy child isn&#39;t enough. That&#39;s<br/>\nsomething that will just happen from life. It&#39;s academics that concern them.<br/>\nThey want something measurable and specific. They want numbers. They want<br/>\nsomething translatable into security for their child.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs much as I&#39;m drawn to the idea of processes to increase IQ, I think it<br/>\npushes what babies really need into the background. What they need is<br/>\naffection and attention and connections with the people in their lives.<br/>\nAnything else is extra. But the emphasis on early *learning* and IQ moves<br/>\nthe spot light onto academics.

Among their other objections, <br/>\nthey equate early parental instruction as early home schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I have personally been involved with this for 21 years, ever since I <br/>\nstarted to teach my two year old how to read. And no, I am not <br/>\ntalking about a high pressure hot housing kind of scene.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you would look at my web page on <br/>\nthis---www.educationbeginsatbirth.com---you will learn more about it <br/>\nand me at the bio section.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI did take a look at Marsh&#39;s site, and it&#39;s interesting reading. I&#39;ve <br/>\nalways believed there was a direct correlation between early social <br/>\nand mental stimulation (not necessarily &#39;schoolwork&#39; per se, but <br/>\nloving and supportive interaction between parent and child) and later <br/>\nlearning abilities, and I&#39;ve often wondered why there&#39;s still a <br/>\nstrong perception that &quot;learning&quot; is something that should start <br/>\nhappening around the age when children would normally go off to <br/>\nschool. I know most homeschoolers know better, that children are <br/>\nlearning from birth (and perhaps even before) but still, most of the <br/>\narticles we receive are directed toward a sort of &quot;parallel school <br/>\nage&quot; group.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarsh&#39;s no-nonsense approach to the topic of very early childhood <br/>\nlearning makes me wonder why the whole subject hasn&#39;t received more <br/>\ndiscussion. Or perhaps it has and I missed it...<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI this message is cross-posted to the following lists:<br/>\nHEM-Networking, HEM-Writers, HEM-Resources, and Unschooling-dotcom<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51034,"nextTopicId":50956}}
