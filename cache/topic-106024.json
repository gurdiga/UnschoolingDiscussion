For instance, they were never sure what to say when someone asked what grade they were in, so we decided they should pick whatever grade they wanted to be in and they could answer.  When asked where they go to school, my ds at about 8 made the mistake of answering oh, we never go to school.  The adult then said oh, so you home school, and he answered no, we don&#39;t do that either we just play and learn.  Unfortunately he got such a negative reaction to this, that now when adults ask weird none of their business type questions, he looks at me and basically wants me to deal with it.  I just say we home school and tell them he is in whatever grade he has decided for that year.  I&#39;m interested to hear how others answer these questions because it&#39;s coming up more now that the kids are getting older and joining more stuff outside the house.  When they see an activity they want to do, I let them be in whatever grade the<br/>\n activity requires them to be.  For instance when my daughter saw an opportunity to go to a summer camp and it said you needed to be in at least 6th grade, that&#39;s what grade she was in, but when she needed to be a fifth grader in order to play on the same softball team as her friend, then she became a 5th grader.  I&#39;m curious to hear how others handle this.<br/>\nAnn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Read only the mail you want - Yahoo!
