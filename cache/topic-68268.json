Or draw...he loves mazes but does them with his finger. I think<br/>\nthat it has something to do with not liking to make mistakes. He saw a little<br/>\ngirl writing and erasing in pencil and thought that it was pretty cool so we<br/>\nhave lots of pencils and erasers around :o) He does like to scribble with those.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad has so far been the only one to give me a hard time about Jason not writing.<br/>\nHe thinks that Jason will not learn unless I make him practice every day. What I have<br/>\ndone is to become proactive (realizing that part of my dad&#39;s concern is that he does<br/>\nnot really know what we are doing...just what we are not doing). I send a monthly <br/>\nemail to my parents and in-laws detailing all the &quot;stuff&quot; that we are doing, books<br/>\nwe are reading, neat things that we are learning, connections that I have seen Jason<br/>\nmake. I also throw in some neat things that he has learned from computer games. :o)<br/>\nI have gotten fewer comments from my dad about what Jason does not know since starting<br/>\nthis. Plus I find it kind of fun for myself too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as other people, I can usually talk enough about Jason&#39;s current interests and<br/>\njust don&#39;t mention what he is not doing. I will have to admit that I had a couple of<br/>\npangs of self-consciousness when he signed his name on his basketball coach&#39;s thank<br/>\nyou card in front of one of the moms...he took his time and erased a couple of times.<br/>\nBut I realize that this is my problem and I also know that Jason tends to wait until<br/>\nhe is good and ready and then does things over night. It is the way that he is. I <br/>\nhave been giving it lots of thought and I think that what makes me self-conscious<br/>\nis the idea that my dad or others would think that I was doing something wrong<br/>\nor not doing something I should be doing. But there is no guarantee that in school<br/>\nhe would  be writing any better then he is now...in fact he might be learning to <br/>\nhate writing. But the difference would be that it would not be my fault. So at least<br/>\nI know that it is all about me. :o) I am not making Jason practice writing and I do<br/>\nknow that he will start when he is ready. Reading here is giving me more confidence<br/>\n and I think that will help me get over my problem. I also know from speaking to <br/>\nlots of hsers that most 6 yo boys are not into writing. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt also has helped me focus on what he does do...he has an incredible vocabulary. If<br/>\nhe hears a word he retains it and uses it correctly. He is very adept at explaining<br/>\nand expressing himself (too much so sometimes!). My dad expressed a concern of Jason<br/>\nnot being able to communicate if he could not write...I was able to point out that<br/>\nthe act of writing is not where the communication happens...it is in the putting <br/>\ntogether of thoughts and words which Jason has no problem doing. I also mentioned that<br/>\nthere is such a thing as typing. The really ironic thing is that my dad has probably<br/>\nthe world&#39;s worst handwriting!
