Anchorage had had the worst snowfall <br/>\nsince 1957 the night his plane was to take off - along with <br/>\nlower-than-normal temperatures. The wings were re-icing faster than <br/>\nthe crews could get them de-iced, so after sitting on the runway for <br/>\nfour hours they cancelled the flight. The next day was confusing, <br/>\nbecause we kept getting mixes messages from the airlines, his wife <br/>\n(100 miles north of the airport), our other sons in Alaska (also 100 <br/>\nmiles from where John was), and various other sources. Finally we <br/>\npinned down via the airline that he&#39;d gotten on a particular plane, <br/>\nbut reports were mixed whether the plane had actually left Anchorage <br/>\nor not. So we trucked back down to the airport and sat there in the <br/>\nmain terminal, which was as close as security would let us get, <br/>\nwatching planeloads of people coming through and trying to figure out <br/>\nif any of them looked like Alaskans.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaw a group of lobsters in bermuda shorts get off a flight from <br/>\nFlorida. Bright serapes and big sombreros tipped us to a flight from <br/>\nMexico. Leis and big floral prints = Hawaii. One flight was primarily <br/>\nsuits with briefcases - didn&#39;t look Alaskan at all. Another flight <br/>\nincluded several families in colorful ethnic dresses - silks, mostly, <br/>\nprobably some Asian country. And then we started seeing what we&#39;d <br/>\nbeen watching for. Haggard, steely-eyed, unshaven, snowboots, parkas <br/>\n- it was Alaskans, sure enough. And toward the end of the group came <br/>\nJohn, wearing his fur-trimmed parka, oversize bunny boots, needed a <br/>\nshave, really needed some sleep, but still smiling. Waved so long to <br/>\na couple of friends he&#39;d made in the ordeal and gave us all big hugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, airports are interesting. Even more interesting these days <br/>\nwatching people trying to get through the security gates. One big <br/>\nburly fellow raised a terrible ruckus when they told him he&#39;d been <br/>\nselected for a random search - he started yelling that he&#39;d already <br/>\nbeen through three &quot;random&quot; searches on that trip and as far as he <br/>\nwas concerned there was nothing &quot;random&quot; about it, that something <br/>\nabout him was raising their red flags, so why didn&#39;t they just quit <br/>\nplaying games and tell him what it was about him that they didn&#39;t <br/>\nlike?

As much as I enjoy and learn from every<br/>\ndigest on this list I<br/>\nstill felt a need to add this note.  I am a dark skinned<br/>\nCosta Rican with 7 sisters and brothers and my hubby one of<br/>\nthree and is from Northern Italian.  Every time I read a<br/>\npost about Irish or Italian families <br/>\nyelling or Spanish/Mexican families having bad tempers I<br/>\ncringe.  It reminds me of<br/>\nnasty comments made by teachers when I was little about<br/>\nMexicans being lazy<br/>\nor assumptions by highschool boys about Spanish girls.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not believe that any person on this list wrote with<br/>\nmalicious intent but I do <br/>\nbelieve that these kinds of generalizations hurt and<br/>\ncripple.  My parents were both <br/>\nabusers.  Physically, emotionally.  Growing up in my house<br/>\nwas akin to growing up in <br/>\na battlefield.  My father was vicious and my mother<br/>\nmentally unstable.  I never knew <br/>\nwhat would set her off, every day, every night was a trip<br/>\nthrough the minefields.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember once an aunt of mine happened by just after my<br/>\nfather had punched my 4 year <br/>\nold brother&#39;s head into a wall (he had spilt milk on the<br/>\ntable).  She sent my uncle into the room to take care of<br/>\nhim while she tended to my black eye and split lip.  I<br/>\nremember her breath on my face <br/>\nwhile she told me it was not his fault, since their father<br/>\nbeat all of them.  I also remember <br/>\nthinking, no it is his fault.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy father and mother were abusers.  Not because of past<br/>\nconnections or treatment or<br/>\neven because of being Costa Rican.  They were abusers<br/>\nperiod.  My father was a silent striker.<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t yell.  He didn&#39;t raise his voice.  Just his fist.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has a gentle nature and a soft spoken way.  His<br/>\nfamily live in America now and are as different from mine<br/>\nas night and day.  They are extraordinarrily quiet and<br/>\njovial and gentle people.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think we need always to remember that people are who they<br/>\nare because of the choices they make and the environment<br/>\nthey make them in.  I am a very quiet individual, so are<br/>\nmost of my brothers and sisters.  Except for the ones who<br/>\nare loud.  Because that&#39;s just the way they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t usually share this much personal info (ever<br/>\nactually) nor do I usually write long posts.<br/>\nBut I had to write and let folks know that at least one<br/>\nperson has been offended by the use of<br/>\nthese generalizations.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for listening</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32357,"nextTopicId":32924}}
