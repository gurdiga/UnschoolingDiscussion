A huge meeting - an international convention with delegates from everywhere. And","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1718770378\">The way I see it, dogs had this big meeting, oh, maybe 20,000 years ago. A <br/>\nhuge meeting - an international convention with delegates from everywhere. <br/>\nAnd that&#39;s when they decided that humans were the up-and-coming species <br/>\nand dogs were going to throw their lot in with them. The decision was <br/>\nobviously not unanimous. The wolves and dingoes walked out in protest. <br/>\n <br/>\nCats had an even more negative reaction. When they heard the news, they <br/>\ncalled their own meeting - in Paris, of course - to denounce canine <br/>\nsubservience to the human hyperpower. (Their manifesto - La Condition <br/>\nFeline - can still be found in provincial bookstores.) <br/>\n <br/>\nCats, it must be said, have not done badly. Using guile and seduction, <br/>\nthey managed to get humans to feed them, thus preserving their <br/>\nsuperciliousness without going hungry. A neat trick. Dogs, being <br/>\nguileless, signed and delivered. It was the beginning of a beautiful <br/>\nfriendship. <br/>\n<br/>\nI must admit that I&#39;ve been slow to warm to dogs. I grew up in a <br/>\nnon-pet-friendly home. Dogs do not figure prominently in Jewish-immigrant <br/>\nhouseholds. My father was not very high on pets. He wasn&#39;t hostile. He <br/>\njust saw them as superfluous, an encumbrance. When the Cossacks are <br/>\nchasing you around Europe, you need to travel light. (This, by the way, is <br/>\nwhy Europe produced far more Jewish violinists than pianists. Try packing <br/>\na piano.) <br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents did allow a hint of zoological indulgence. I had a pet turtle. <br/>\nMy brother had a parakeet. Both came to unfortunate ends. My turtle fell <br/>\nbehind a radiator and was not discovered until too late. And the parakeet, <br/>\nGod bless him, flew out a window once, never to be seen again. After such <br/>\ndisplays of stewardship, we dared not ask for a dog. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy introduction to the wonder of dogs came from my wife Robyn. She&#39;s <br/>\nAustralian. And Australia, as lovingly recounted in Bill Bryson&#39;s In a <br/>\nSunburned Country, has the craziest, wildest, deadliest, meanest animals <br/>\non the planet. In a place where every spider and squid can take you down <br/>\nfaster than a sucker-punched boxer, you cherish niceness in the animal <br/>\nkingdom. And they don&#39;t come nicer than dogs. <br/>\n <br/>\nRobyn started us off slowly. She got us a border collie, Hugo, when our <br/>\nson was about 6. She knew that would appeal to me because the border <br/>\ncollie is the smartest species on the planet. Hugo could 1) play outfield <br/>\nin our backyard baseball games, 2) do flawless front-door sentry duty, and  <br/>\n3) play psychic weatherman, announcing with a wail every coming <br/>\nthunderstorm. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen our son Daniel turned 10, he wanted a dog of his own. I was against <br/>\nit, using arguments borrowed from seminars on nuclear nonproliferation. It <br/>\nwas hopeless. One giant &quot;Please, Dad,&quot; and I caved completely. Robyn went <br/>\nout to Winchester, Va., found a litter of black Labs and brought home <br/>\nChester. <br/>\n <br/>\nChester is what psychiatrists mean when they talk about unconditional <br/>\nlove. Unbridled is more like it. Come into our house, and he was so happy <br/>\nto see you, he would knock you over. (Deliverymen learned to leave things <br/>\nat the front door.)<br/>\n <br/>\nIn some respects - Ph.D. potential, for example - I don&#39;t make any great <br/>\nclaims for Chester. When I would arrive home, I fully expected to find <br/>\nHugo reading the newspaper. Not Chester. Chester would try to make his way <br/>\nthrough a narrow sliding door, find himself stuck halfway and then look at <br/>\nme with total and quite genuine puzzlement. I don&#39;t think he ever got to <br/>\nunderstand that the rear part of him was actually attached to the front. <br/>\n <br/>\nBut it was Chester, who dispensed affection as unreflectively as he <br/>\nbreathed, who got me thinking about this long-ago pact between humans and <br/>\ndogs. Cat lovers and the pet averse will just roll their eyes at such <br/>\ndogophilia. I can&#39;t help it. Chester was always at your foot or your hand, <br/>\nwaiting to be petted and stroked, played with and talked to. His beautiful <br/>\nblocky head, his wonderful overgrown puppy&#39;s body, his baritone bark <br/>\nfilled every corner of house and heart. <br/>\n <br/>\nThen last month, at the tender age of 8, he died quite suddenly. The long, <br/>\nslobbering, slothful decline we had been looking forward to was not to be. <br/>\nWhen told the news, a young friend who was a regular victim of Chester&#39;s <br/>\nlunging love-bombs said mournfully, &quot;He was the sweetest creature I ever <br/>\nsaw. He&#39;s the only dog I ever saw kiss a cat.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSome will protest that in a world with so much human suffering, it is <br/>\nsomething between eccentric and obscene to mourn a dog. I think not. After <br/>\nall, it is perfectly normal, indeed, deeply human to be moved when nature <br/>\npresents us with a vision of great beauty. Should we not be moved when it <br/>\nproduces a vision - a creature - of the purest sweetness? <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the Jun. 16, 2003 issue of TIME</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74209,"nextTopicId":74214}}
