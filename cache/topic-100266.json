Those <br/>\nturkey vultures are the most &quot;brave&quot; scavengers I&#39;ve seen, and  the only reason <br/>\nI hit that one is that he changed direction in midflight and  flew right into <br/>\nmy car mirror.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe in the desert it&#39;s harder for animals to distinguish between a road  <br/>\nand just dirt.  Where I lived, the road was two-lane with no shoulder, with  <br/>\nfields or forest on either side.  The road was harder to wander onto, when  you <br/>\nconsider the natural habitat is the fields or forest or  underbrush.  I guess.  <br/>\n:)<br/>\n <br/>\nI just think that little animals wandering on to the highway is more a  <br/>\nfunction of the animals&#39; behavior, and not necessarily what a human  throws out the <br/>\nwindow.   <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Throwing fruit out the car window","postDate":"1096991825","msgId":100277,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlhLjE2MzgyYjNkLjJlOTQxZTUxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":100271,"nextInTopic":100288,"prevInTime":100276,"nextInTime":100278,"topicId":100266,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/5/04 9:13:57 AM, tuckervill2@aol.com writes:  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1955848211\">In a message dated 10/5/04 9:13:57 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tuckervill2@...\">tuckervill2@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I never see dead raptors on the highway.
