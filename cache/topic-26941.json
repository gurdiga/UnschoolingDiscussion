Bandages, antibiotic cream, pain killer, etc..**<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep a first aid kit in my car, to cover things that might happen while <br/>\nwe&#39;re out and about. I try to remember to check it over every four months or <br/>\nso, and to rotate the stock. If a bandage has been in the kit for a year I <br/>\nput a fresh one in and move the old one to the house stockpile where it will <br/>\nalmost certainly be used within six months. And so on. The car kit hasn&#39;t <br/>\nbeen used very much in the five years I&#39;ve kept it, but we were very very <br/>\ngrateful to have it those few times we needed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26934,"nextTopicId":26945}}
