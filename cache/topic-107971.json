I don&#39;t like to <br/>\nhave them.&lt;g&gt;   Too much responsibility.   I had an autographed copy of Shane <br/>\nand gave it away.   Of course I wish I hadn&#39;t.   But I&#39;m glad I did.   I gave <br/>\naway an autographed copy of the first novel my friend wrote (she&#39;s written <br/>\nseveral now) because it was about a period and incident I didn&#39;t care about; gave <br/>\nit to an unschooler teen who WAS interested.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I told Keith was that I like to think of books as the essence of them, <br/>\nthe information that&#39;s in them, not as their physical selves.     On the other <br/>\nhand, I write in my books, and that makes that copy important to me (and <br/>\nrelatively less valuable to others, which is fine with me, because in my view of <br/>\n&quot;that book&quot; I haven&#39;t harmed the book (the greater soul of that collection of <br/>\nwritings), just that COPY of the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nA hundred years ago, and even more 200 years ago, and VASTLY more 500 years <br/>\nago, that thought would have been nonsense.   A book was a very valuable thing. <br/>\n  More than the new iMac I just got (which was also one of millions, and <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be expected to last me ten years).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was watching Sense and Sensibility yesterday.   Part of the subplot of the <br/>\nmovie (not of the essence of the novel, I think, which has existed since the <br/>\n18th century in many copies and passed through MANY kinds of printing <br/>\nprocesses) is that the youngest sister loves an atlas that was at their house, in the <br/>\nlibrary of the &quot;stately home&quot; (just an everyday large estate with dozens of <br/>\nservants, in those days—not a government-subsidized museum).    An older <br/>\nhalf-brother inherits the house.   The house includes the library.   The atlas belongs <br/>\nto the owner of the house, whoever that might be.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore that there was such a thing as &quot;bound libraries&quot;:   books were chained <br/>\nto the tables.   Y&#39;know bookstands, angled bookstands?   There were big ones, <br/>\nwith benches in front of them.   Books LIVED there--not ten years, like an <br/>\ni-Mac.   Hundreds of   years, in universities.   Universities existed because <br/>\nbooks lived in certain places.   They weren&#39;t carried around in backpacks or the <br/>\nback windows of cars.   They weren&#39;t carried around anywhere.   They were <br/>\ntransported in wooden trunks to the place where they would live from then on.    <br/>\n<br/>\nTo this day, in English universities, someone will say &quot;I&#39;m reading in <br/>\nhistory&quot; (whereas Americans say &quot;I&#39;m majoring in history&quot;).   They go to the <br/>\nuniversity to read (at least linguistically), still.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108047,"nextTopicId":108060}}
