I am still working on my technique with the spinning wheel so the drop spindle get used quite a bit still.  I even brought it with me on vacation and worked on spinning in the hotel room.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the mothers in our homeschool group taught a class on dyeing and spinning.  She made each participant a drop spindle for around $1 using two wooden &quot;wheel&quot; pieces and a dowel with a metal hook at the top.  Another of the mothers in our goup then followed up with a knitting class, with homemade wooden knitting needles.  It was a fantastic experience and my kids now love to work with wool.  We are planning a &quot;sheep to shawl&quot; project where we take a fleece, clean it, dye it, spin it and then knit it into a shawl or sweater.  Considering these are new skills for *all* of us, it will be interesting to see how it turns out!<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing a drop spindle is quite easy, it took about an hour or so to master the technique.  It is slow going, but portable so you can keep it in the car and work on it at opportune moments (unlike a spinning wheel).  Some of the women I know actually prefer a drop spindle because of the portability.  I do love working on it, but really enjoy the &quot;zen&quot; of working on a spinning wheel.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy eldest daughter has been lobbying hard to get a table loom.  Her interest is in weaving the product.  I told her we need to start a little smaller (and cheaper!).  <br/>\n<br/>\nChristine in VA<br/>\nHsing Mom to 3 DD&#39;s (ages 9, 7 1/2 and almost 4)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7527178,"authorName":"CelticFrau@aol.com","from":"CelticFrau@...","profile":"celticfrau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Drop spindle/Textiles (formerly Teaching Ourselves)","postDate":"1073181717","msgId":87734,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRlLjQyYWVmMzgyLjJkMjhjZTE1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":87722,"nextInTopic":87786,"prevInTime":87733,"nextInTime":87735,"topicId":87653,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/3/2004 6:35:44 PM Eastern Standard Time, ... stairwell to drop their spindles over to more easily get a really long thread before winding,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1080711284\">In a message dated 1/3/2004 6:35:44 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dezigna@...\">dezigna@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I remember in college the whole textiles class using the center of the big<br/>\n </span></blockquote>stairwell to drop their spindles over to more easily get a really long<br/>\nthread before winding, and the extra weight.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n************************************<br/>\nI sold a bunch of stuff on Ebay last year about this time and bought myself a <br/>\nspinning wheel.
