We did the Saxon Math lessons everyday...after lots of coercing. <br/>\n They both learned alot inspite of resistance. Now we are unschooling (again) <br/>\n and I am having trouble just LETTING GO of math...I doubt that they are ever <br/>\n going to choose to do it on their own...the stuff they were learning, we <br/>\n will probably never come across naturally &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust what&#39;s happened to us is what I can talk about... I had these questions <br/>\nas well when I first started and it&#39;s really more about me and my fears than <br/>\nanything else.  My son Zak seems to be thriving and happy.  Sometimes he&#39;ll <br/>\nbe on a computer program for 4 hours and he just turned 5 yesterday.  And <br/>\nthen he&#39;s not interested for a few days or he may got through a week where he <br/>\nwants to play on the computer.  Those computer programs he&#39;s playing with are <br/>\nMath and Reading programs couched in Reader Rabbit, DK products, Madeline <br/>\netc... The other day he watched 5 videos in a row and I was panic stricken <br/>\nthat he&#39;d never get up from in front of the television.  He was watching <br/>\nabout elephants in africa, austrialia and the great barrier reef, madeline <br/>\nand winnie the pooh, then back onto a gorilla tape.... So I have to ask <br/>\nmyself... Would I be this concerned and gripped if he were sitting at the <br/>\nkitchen table with math school books for 5 hours... No of course not... I <br/>\nthink I had to deschool myself first and accept that this was going to be ok <br/>\nno matter what.<br/>\n<br/>\nBedtimes we try and stick to a rough time because hubby and I want time <br/>\ntogether.  So he goes somewhere between 7:30pm (if he&#39;s really tired) and <br/>\n9:30pm (if we are playing games with him.  My husband likes him up later <br/>\nbecause he&#39;s a work all day and wants to spend time with him... So we <br/>\ncompromise and some nights it&#39;s early so we can have time and some times it&#39;s <br/>\nlater so they can have time... It&#39;s sort of evolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath can be found everywhere.  Zak looks at all the prices of things when we <br/>\ngo to the grocery store and I&#39;ve been talking about them being percentages or <br/>\nfractions of other numbers.  He asked what I meant the other day so this will <br/>\nbe my opportunity to show him something.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m finding fascinating is that I&#39;m learning so much more about the <br/>\nthings that I didn&#39;t think I knew from before.  Also that I&#39;m very creative <br/>\nin giving him information and that it&#39;s not that difficult to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F<br/>\nTucson, AZ</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12196,"nextTopicId":12215}}
