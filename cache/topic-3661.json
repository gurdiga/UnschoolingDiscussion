I never did work out<br/>\nhow to deal with comforting without it. Like when #2 had his finger jammed in a<br/>\ndoor and totally flattened (at age 8 months). Having established it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nbroken, they had to squeeze it to mold it back into shape. Imagining the<br/>\nscreaming? Nope, none - he nursed through the lot. Then the time we were<br/>\nvisiting and #4 (at about 15 months) put his hand on the unprotected wood stove.<br/>\nHe did scream but nursing was a great comfort. And then there was ....... too<br/>\nnumerous examples. Praps it make the likes of me lazy, but it always seemed such<br/>\nan easy way to comfort that I didn&#39;t bother looking for too many alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith respect to time out with or without my husband, I really wanted that time<br/>\nwhen I had my 1st, but by the time the 2nd arrived, and from then on, it hasn&#39;t<br/>\nbothered me having the kids with me. Now the oldest is 18 and the youngest is<br/>\nnine, we do go out sometimes. But most of the time, knowing we CAN go out alone<br/>\nis enough, and most of the time we choose to take the kids. What is really nice,<br/>\nis being able now to take just one and spend some special time with that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lori","from":"&quot;Lori&quot; &lt;HarmNone@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"b-VDXeyJx5oXB7xSP6QXUu5ACYijnHUt6RTqeDkMK9kFijxFKt0InmWtytyQJxlhBS4DQb8mvp6rP73Sh5uTNJPQmhk","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"AP","postDate":"939467401","msgId":3661,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNDcuMzY2MS45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3677,"prevInTime":3660,"nextInTime":3662,"topicId":3661,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I would read to the older ones, sit at the computer or do paper work as<br/>\nneeded. Before slings became readily available, I used a twin-sized sheet as<br/>\na sling. Our babies were always in arms. At night the baby was (is) tucked<br/>\nin next to me while I read to the older ones and do my own reading.
