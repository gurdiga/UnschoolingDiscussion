When I tell &quot;others&quot; of what we do in a<br/>\nschoolish way, they are usually impressed.  What I don&#39;t tell is how we<br/>\nspend most of our time, because it would seem like we are doing &quot;nothing&quot;<br/>\ncompared to what kids in school appear to be doing all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nTesting, IMO, is one of the major weaknesses of ps.  A member of our<br/>\nschool board said ~Yes, we teach to the test, but experts have figured<br/>\nout what kids need to know and that is what&#39;s on the test~  I DO NOT<br/>\nbelieve that tests accurately measure what a person knows.  I&#39;ve always<br/>\nbeen good at taking tests and scored well in college classes but remember<br/>\nso little of what I tested well at.  Used to study with a friend who<br/>\nobviously knew the material better than I, yet I got better grades<br/>\nbecause she freaked out at test time.  Don&#39;t know if tests are useful for<br/>\nanything.  Is a Doctor who scores well on the medical boards a better Dr.<br/>\nthan one who barely passes?  I don&#39;t have the answer to how we can trust<br/>\nthat an expert we pay money to see is truly knowledgeable. <br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, as someone pointed out in something I read, we DO NOT know what<br/>\nour children will need to know in 20 or 30 years!  I think reading is<br/>\nimportant, but will everyone really need to be literate in 2040?  Maybe<br/>\ncomputers will be so prevalent and so different from what we can imagine<br/>\nthat people will only need to know how to push buttons?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nBe absolutely determined to enjoy what you do.<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>\nTry Juno Web: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Michele Moss","from":"&quot;Michele Moss&quot; &lt;michele@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"EMGFHMZ3Feg-s34R9ulfI1VpDk37d971qC3HNzMo0o1Jfij3WMux1swiK3kyQJ81WajiwNs27uGhMdudZXIzU-0W5-sIZJI18KJ5","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: How do we know they are learning?","postDate":"936722748","msgId":2720,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xOTQuMjcyMC45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2711,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":2719,"nextInTime":2721,"topicId":2711,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It seems to me <br/>\nthat spirited, active alert, and gifted children have a tendancy to <br/>\nhave a different learning style, awareness of the world around them, <br/>\nand view things with a different perspective than most.  what <br/>\nconcerns me is who is determining the right/wrong answer for tests <br/>\nthat are developed for very young children (pre-school age), what <br/>\nexactly is being done with the results of these tests in terms of <br/>\nwhat they are teaching the children?  in my opinion they must plan on <br/>\nteaching the children to have a very narrow way of thinking and <br/>\ndiscourage any creative, extended, analytical thinking!  <br/>\nan example of a test question would be... &quot;Birds fly and fish _____&quot;. <br/>\nthe expected answer is &quot;fish swim&quot;.  A child answering &quot;fish don&#39;t&quot; <br/>\nwould be penalized with the wrong answer.  h-m-m-m-m-m.  is this a <br/>\ntrue measure of what a person/child really knows?  why is the answer <br/>\n&quot;fish don&#39;t&quot; not the &quot;right&quot; answer too!  it seems to me that this <br/>\nwould only serve to stifle a child&#39;s learning and comprehension of <br/>\nthe world around them into not looking at things from all <br/>\nperspectives!  this was a test question given to a four year old.  As <br/>\ni mentioned in my reply there, they wouldn&#39;t have gotten off that <br/>\neasy had it been Sterling.  He would have gone on to justify that <br/>\nsome birds don&#39;t fly and some swim and provided them with examples.  <br/>\ni&#39;m getting a little off track here but my point is that it seems to <br/>\nme that the public schools are working awfully hard to teach kids how <br/>\nto be dumber with these tests that are supposedly developed by <br/>\n&quot;experts&quot; and that anyone here who has doubts about their choice to <br/>\nunschool their kids should rejoice!!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Besides, as someone pointed out in something I read, we DO NOT know<br/>\n&gt; what our children will need to know in 20 or 30 years!

Voice recognition computers in the <br/>\npresent are more often used for people with disabilities and are not <br/>\nusually within the budget of the average household that owns a <br/>\ncomputer.  but i don&#39;t think it will be that far in the future where <br/>\nthese will become the normal household computer.  this means our kids <br/>\nwon&#39;t even have to know how to type or compose a sentence correctly <br/>\nbecause the computer will do it for us.  and yes, who else knows what <br/>\nwill be commonplace in 2040!  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mary Ellen<br/>\n&gt; Be absolutely determined to enjoy what you do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Michele Moss<br/>\nMom of Sterling Tyler age 3 yrs old<br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Resource Web site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.icstech.net/~michele\">http://www.icstech.net/~michele</a><br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Discussion Group:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/list/psk\">http://www.egroups.com/list/psk</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2701,"nextTopicId":2722}}
