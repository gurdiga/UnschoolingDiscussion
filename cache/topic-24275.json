I believe in Positive Discipline ala Barbara Coloroso, Jane Nelson, <br/>\nand Mary Sheedy Kurchinka(Raising Your Spirited Child). What I was saying is <br/>\nI am trying my hardest to be a Zen mommy but I do at times lose it and yell. <br/>\nZoe also yells. I believe it is in us but we can change and want to.I am not <br/>\ncondoning yelling at my child in anger,I hate when I do it but I admit to <br/>\ndoing it. I do however feel it is better than what I grew up w/ which was <br/>\nshaming and blaming and name calling. So I am at least doing better than the <br/>\ngeneration before me. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Am I understood yet? Or do you still think I am a person to steer clear of?<br/>\n<br/>\n  One other thing. I do prefer my style of yelling and screaming yet having <br/>\nit over and done w/ than my dh&#39;s silence and avoidance technique that can <br/>\nlast a day. Makes me feel my life as I know it is over. Again this stems from <br/>\nmy history and coping skills. Hopefully over the years we will find the best <br/>\nway to argue for us and be comfortable w/ it.
