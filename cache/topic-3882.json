Yet many<br/>\nof<br/>\nus want it to be someone else&#39;s kids who grow up to: put up drywall, lay<br/>\n<br/>\ntile, deliver mail, maintain and repair autos, cut hair, etc.  This way<br/>\nof<br/>\nthinking seems exploitive to me.  We do want SOMEONE to do these things<br/>\nbecause they are badly needed.  But if we don&#39;t value these jobs and<br/>\nthink of<br/>\nthem as undesireable, it seems like we are using these people.  Does<br/>\nthis<br/>\nmake any sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nyes! it makes tons of sence!! it does bother me alot when i hear people<br/>\nsay to kids they will end up flipping burgers if they dont go to a<br/>\nuniversity. the fast food industry seems to be booming and someone needs<br/>\nto fill them and alot of us are thank ful for them specially those 2<br/>\nincome familys that resort to a fast food meal frequently because of<br/>\nschedules. and someone has to clean all those big office buildings!<br/>\nanyway i&#39;m glad you brought up the subject because i have been bothered<br/>\nby comments i&#39;ve heard lately. the job does not make the person, though<br/>\nthere are many who believe it does. because they have no life outside of<br/>\nthier work. ok i&#39;ll be done ranting.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3864,"nextTopicId":3845}}
