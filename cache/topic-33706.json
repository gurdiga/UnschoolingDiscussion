You leave your children in the home even though you know that the<br/>\nwoman does not want to be there and does want to be in a psych unit.  You<br/>\nleave your children in the home even though you see that this woman has not<br/>\nbathed and isn&#39;t eating.  You leave the children even though you know that<br/>\nsupport will not be there for at least an hour.  You leave the children<br/>\nthere even though several people have warned you that this women is not<br/>\nstable and needs care herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, that is prosecutable and should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  You are a caregiver and you are suppose to be helping to care for<br/>\nchildren at 9 a.m.  You do not show up until several hours later and by that<br/>\ntime the children are dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, that is prosecutable and should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  Your patient is a diabetic who has a history of going into<br/>\ndiabetic comas.  The family tells you the patient is in the same condition<br/>\nshe has been in just prior to all other times she has gone into a coma.  You<br/>\nsay no admissions and, oh by the way, I am going to take the patient off her<br/>\nmedication.  Patient goes into coma and subsequently dies.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, that is prosecutable and should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, if those lols are paranoid schizophrenics who have a prior history of<br/>\nviolence, then no you shouldn&#39;t be letting your children play there IF the<br/>\npatients are not medicated and closely monitored.  However, there are many<br/>\nforms of schizophrenia, so a blanket discription doesn&#39;t really tell what is<br/>\ngoing on next door to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the bank robbery.  Hey, you are a female, in TX they just might<br/>\nprosecute you!<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jnjstau@...\">jnjstau@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 25, 2002 10:00 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1887<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;If they are supposedly known as being so tough on child abuse&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There isn&#39;t any supposedly about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;why didn&#39;t they prosecute the father and the doctor...and the mil&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If there had been a pattern of abuse or neglect, they would have.
