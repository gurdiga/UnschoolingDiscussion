It has been a little scary to hold off and not push math <br/>\nin a formal way and 12 is not a magic age, that&#39;s just where we are.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn his earlier years he has played with different bricks, geoboards, computer <br/>\ngames, helped me with shopping/cooking/sewing and other activities that <br/>\nrequired math skills, he helps us plan trips and figure out the shortest <br/>\nroute and how long it will take to get there, he handles his own money <br/>\nincluding figuring out percentages for spending or donations.  Because of <br/>\nthese activities, he had a pretty good handle on math ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pleased that we are using a more formal training as well, however and <br/>\nhere&#39;s why.  We are finding that he often has the skill (say multiplication) <br/>\nbut he doesn&#39;t know what the text book is asking for when he is instructed to <br/>\nmultiply 6 by 5.  Becoming familiar with the language that will be used by <br/>\ncollege instructors is important.  I&#39;ve found it interesting to note that the <br/>\nlanguage varies so much from text to text or from instructor to instructor, <br/>\nso even with this preparation there will still be some adapting to future <br/>\nteachers.  Still, I think it will help.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t hurt that my dh and I both like math and science, I suppose.  This <br/>\nis a subject that our family has fun doing together.  Perhaps my answer might <br/>\nbe different if it were a chore to any of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really believe that math skills can be polished at a later date and there <br/>\nis no real need to insist on formal early training.

So we have a mixture of texts and fun math books <br/>\nand workbooks and CDs (Math in the Real World, Mathblaster series, etc., <br/>\netc.) and lots and lots of fun -- build a bridge in the sandbox or help Mom <br/>\nwith the shopping (this is fun if you are getting something like candy!) or <br/>\nread the cartoons in the Algebra book (my son thinks this is a big yuck) <br/>\nwhich leads to actual math discussions or do a puzzle book or play a logic <br/>\ngame (Zoombinis is nice) on the computer.   It all counts and it&#39;s all math <br/>\neven if it&#39;s not in the &quot;right&quot; order. We use a mixture of everything and, <br/>\nwhile some unschoolers don&#39;t include textbooks, we do and you can do whatever <br/>\nsuits your fancy!  And follow up with whatever you need when you find an area <br/>\nyou want/need to know more about.<br/>\n<br/>\nSide note:  I usually look at websites when I see someone recommend a <br/>\ncurriculum or program -- I use the math sections as a gauge of whether or not <br/>\nit will fit my kids.  I usually find that the packaged currics contain a lot <br/>\nof repetition and spread subjects over many years -- things we have covered <br/>\nand revisited and will talk/read about again in context -- breaking things up <br/>\ninto tiny little steps when this is not what my kids need.   For example, <br/>\nfractions -- do we really need to learn 1/2 and 1/4 one year and 1/10 and <br/>\n1/100 the next and then decimals two years later and repeat it all every <br/>\nsingle year for 6+ years?  Not around here.  Do you encounter those concepts <br/>\nand much more in just doing -- around here -- yes.  You bake or you watch a <br/>\nscience show or you do an experiment or you share a candy bar (do you see a <br/>\ntheme?).  Just a tiny example, but if you are aware of what you might cover I <br/>\nthink you will be reassured that these things do really come up in real life <br/>\nand you don&#39;t have to repeat them to death or do 100 problems on a page to <br/>\nget the info thru.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!  Don&#39;t feel guilty if a text is a comfort -- but don&#39;t let it <br/>\ndictate how you learn things.  That&#39;s what we do anyway!<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Dalene Mactier","from":"&quot;Dalene Mactier&quot; &lt;Mactier@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"AVyfil8TMegBxK8qOZF9vkDC66e41kwPKtULOK2u1HBt4x2Jcx5dBZNuJJp6qfL6abXEYI1iwIgJYKO3ftnBa51wjksm9EY-GbzBx8o","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"What about Mathematics??","postDate":"975921288","msgId":14352,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkwZm5hOStzaWVtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14354,"prevInTime":14351,"nextInTime":14353,"topicId":14352,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All My husband and I are still in the discovering stages unschooling.
