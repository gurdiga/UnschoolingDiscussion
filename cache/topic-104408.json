As a new unschooler, I so understand <br/>\nwhat its like to let go of those rigid schooly ways, and how great it feels <br/>\nwhen you see the results.  Unschooling is as much about how we parent as how <br/>\nour children learn, until the two really become inseparable.  Even though I&#39;m <br/>\nnot religious, I compare becoming an unschooler to being a Born Again; it makes <br/>\nyou feel so sad for those who aren&#39;t &quot;saved.&quot;  It makes me want to rescue all <br/>\nthose children trapped in a world where the adults can&#39;t or won&#39;t listen to <br/>\ntheir needs.<br/>\n    Last night I took Skyler and Aric to see the highschool production of <br/>\nSuessical, which was terrific.  But the huge crowd of talking people was really <br/>\ntough on my HS boys.  We found  seats, and I suggested I sit in the middle.  <br/>\nAric seemed to panic, but couldn&#39;t tell me why.  Somehow I realized he was <br/>\nafraid to have a stranger sit next to him.  Skyler really understood and <br/>\nuncharacteristically gave up sitting next to me.  He was proud to be Aric&#39;s &quot;buffer.&quot;  <br/>\nAric covered his ears until the show began, and then chewed his shirt till <br/>\nintermission.  It took a lot of silent reminders to myself, not to stop him for <br/>\nthe sake of the SHIRT?!  At intermission, figuring it was too much for them, I <br/>\ngave them the option of leaving.  They totally wanted to stay!  We found an <br/>\nempty section of the lobby to have our snack, and Skyler began imitating <br/>\ndifferent animals, sliding and crawling around the floor and under a table.  My knee <br/>\njerk reaction was Inappropriate! but I only said, &quot;You&#39;re going to get dirty,&quot; <br/>\nhoping that would do the trick.  It was so hard for me to have people seeing <br/>\nhim behave this way and worrying how that reflected on my parenting.  Would <br/>\npeople think there was something wrong with this child?  Well, he sat up, and <br/>\ncalmly announced,&quot;I don&#39;t mind.&quot;  So I stopped myself from saying anything and he <br/>\nbuffed up that floor for the next 10 minutes.  A tiny boy, maybe two years <br/>\nold, watched transfixed, then got down and slid around and crawled too.  I was <br/>\ntelling myself, Skyler&#39;s &quot;acting out&quot; because he&#39;s stressed.  But then it <br/>\nfinally occurred to me that This Was Fun!  He may have been inspired by some of the <br/>\nanimal characters in the play and the acrobatic dancing, but mostly he was <br/>\njust being my son, who sees this wide polished floor as a real opportunity for <br/>\nfun.  It made me sad to think how highschool kids never got to use it that way, <br/>\nmaybe never even saw the possibilities.   At the end of intermission, we went <br/>\nback in, all in a good mood, the boys because they&#39;d had their freedom, me <br/>\nbecause I&#39;d had this ah ha moment.<br/>\n    We drove home making lots of silly Dr. Suess-like rhymes, laughing our <br/>\nbutts off the whole way.  What a great night!  The kind of night I once would <br/>\nhave avoided; would have called a recipe for disaster, because I just couldn&#39;t <br/>\nlet go of how others would perceive my children and myself.

We still had a full day and enjoyed <br/>\nourselves thoroughly, so I&#39;m glad I let go of that. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got there Matt looked out the window of the parking garage <br/>\nand said, &quot;Hey!  It says Crayola!&quot;  He&#39;s had moments of frustration <br/>\nlately that he&#39;s not reading yet and he wishes he could read, so I <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Cool!  And how fun that you read that!&quot;  He said, &quot;I didn&#39;t <br/>\nread that.  I just remember what that word looks like from the <br/>\ncrayons&quot;.  I told him that&#39;s part of what reading is, and he seemed <br/>\nhappy about that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got inside I realized that Alisha and I had forgotten our <br/>\ncameras in the car.  I suggested going back out and get them but all <br/>\nthe kids said that they really didn&#39;t want to go back out to the <br/>\ngarage, so I gave up my &quot;need&quot; to follow them around taking pictures <br/>\nof everything they do and just had fun without the camera.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe very first thing we came to in the Crayola factory was a <br/>\ndemonstration of how they make crayons.  We saw this 2 years ago when <br/>\nwe went to the Crayola factory and they didn&#39;t want to watch it. Nor <br/>\ndid they want to do a  paper bag puppet craft. (They&#39;ve made lots of <br/>\npaper bag puppets at home).  Instantly, a voice in my head starting <br/>\nworrying that they wouldn&#39;t want to do enough cool things and that <br/>\nfeeling of wanting to do every single thing we possibly could do hit <br/>\nme for a second, but instead of listening to that voice and that <br/>\nfeeling, I said, &quot;Okay!&quot; and we moved on to some neat stuff.  Fun <br/>\nhouse mirrors and writing on the glass wall with special markers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt this time of the year there are often school groups at the Crayola <br/>\nfactory, and they&#39;re on a time schedule because they have to get back <br/>\nto the school at a certain time.  They&#39;re always in groups of about 4 <br/>\nplus an adult--I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s a Crayola requirement.  I <br/>\nnoticed when we were writing on the films with markers and putting <br/>\nthem under the light so that the picture is projected onto the wall <br/>\nthat the school kids got to do it for just a few minutes and then <br/>\nwere rushed on to the next activity.  My kids played in that area for <br/>\na loooooong time and really did some creative slides.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the model magic area, they gave out feathers and pipe cleaners <br/>\nwith the model magic and suggested making birds.  They also had <br/>\ncookie cutters and rolling pins available.  I watched a lot of the <br/>\nkids making their model magic creations and I didn&#39;t see any kids <br/>\nother than mine who made things other than the suggested birds or <br/>\nsomething from a cookie cutter.  Not that there&#39;s anything at all <br/>\nwrong with making the suggested bird or using a cookie cutter, but it <br/>\nwas fun to see that it was the unschooled kids making unusual <br/>\ncharacters with funny names.  They were also the only ones that I saw <br/>\nlaughing and having a REALLY good time with it.  Not that the other <br/>\nkids weren&#39;t having a pleasant time, but my kids were obviously <br/>\nhaving a REALLY good time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother activity was a painting activity.  You paint the paper and <br/>\nthen send it through a drying machine, then take it in and glue a <br/>\nbirds egg that looks like it&#39;s hatching onto it.  Luke wanted to <br/>\npaint because he wanted to use the drying machine but he didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto do the rest of the activity.  The old school-at-home me would have <br/>\ninsisted he did the craft the way they said to do it, but I let him <br/>\npaint and do the drying machine and then move on.  There were two <br/>\nboys standing by the drying machine who looked very excited about <br/>\ngetting their pictures out of the drying machine and the 2 women with <br/>\nthem (I think their moms) kept yelling and nagging at them to not <br/>\ntouch the conveyer belt and not stand so close to the machine, and <br/>\njust stupid stuff.  Luke just stood there looking at those moms like <br/>\nhe couldn&#39;t figure them out (lol).  When the boys&#39; pictures were <br/>\nthrough the machine, one of them  wanted to send them through a <br/>\nsecond time but the mom said, &quot;No!  We&#39;re doing something else now! <br/>\nGet away from there!&quot;  Yikes!  Why could the boys have not sent their <br/>\npictures through the drying machine again?  Luke got his picture out <br/>\nand happily went on his way.  He knew I would have let him put it <br/>\nthrough the drying machine as many times as he wanted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the top floor of the Crayola factory is the Canal Museum.  There&#39;s <br/>\na really cool water canal table there and all 3 kids really got into <br/>\nit.  Then a school group of 4 girls came and just kind of pushed <br/>\ntheir way into the table and took over.  Alisha and Matt just backed <br/>\noff and sat beside me on the bench but Luke played for awhile <br/>\nlonger.  Alisha had me cracking up in her reactions to the chaperone <br/>\nwho was with them.  It&#39;s hard to describe in written form the <br/>\ndramatic tone of voice he used when talking to these kids, but it was <br/>\npathetic.  Before they even got to the table he said (in a tone of <br/>\nvoice that indicated that he thought the people he was talking to had <br/>\nvery little intelligence and could barely understand English), before <br/>\nyou play in the water I want you to push up your sleeves.  And if you <br/>\ncan&#39;t push them up, ROLL them up (and he gestured with his hand to <br/>\nshow what rolling up looked like, lol).  These girls were maybe 7 or <br/>\n8 years old.  I hadn&#39;t even thought to tell my kids to roll up their <br/>\nsleeves first.  They did, without me telling them, and if they hadn&#39;t <br/>\nI might have suggested it...but this guy didn&#39;t give these kids a <br/>\nchance.  And then he stood there trying to explain stuff to them <br/>\nabout how he thought they should build their canal pieces instead of <br/>\njust letting them play and figure some things out on their own. He <br/>\ngave them a lecture about how when they got to the gift shop they <br/>\nwere to pick something little and how big things are for Christmas <br/>\nand birthdays but not school field trips (and used his hands to show <br/>\nthe difference between big and litle in case a 7 year old child <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know the difference.  It was rather odd I thought, because I&#39;m <br/>\nassuming his point was that they shouldn&#39;t expect to spend a lot of <br/>\nmoney there, but he described it as though expensive things are big <br/>\nin size and inexpensive things are small in size). Then when it was <br/>\ntime to go he told them to make sure they stayed together because <br/>\nhe&#39;d be SO SAD if he lost one of them.  If you heard his tone of <br/>\nvoice you&#39;d realize how hilarious yet sad it was.  Alisha (who&#39;s 11) <br/>\nhad no idea that I was spending so much time thinking about the <br/>\ndifferences between schooled kids on a field trip and unschooling <br/>\nkids having a fun day out.  She kept looking at me and raising her <br/>\neyebrows and rolling her eyes whenever he said something insulting to <br/>\nthe intelligence of those poor kids, and then when they left she <br/>\nshook her head and did a perfect imitation of &quot;So sad...&quot;  But then <br/>\nshe pointed out that the guy kept telling all them all kinds of <br/>\nstupid stuff but didn&#39;t point out to them that they had just taken <br/>\nover something that someone else was working on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also a level of the canal museum about fabric.  One part lets <br/>\nyou design an outfit on a dummy using material.  Alisha designed an <br/>\noutfit that she thought was neat and then wished she had her camera <br/>\nbecause she wanted to remember it.  I told her we could go out and <br/>\nget it although there would be a chance that someone else would come <br/>\nalong and change the outfit.  We took the chance and rushed to the <br/>\nparking garage for the camera.  They were running along the sidewalk <br/>\nracing to the parking garage and I was tempted to complain about how <br/>\nfast they were going but then I told myself to just consider it <br/>\nexercise and to be glad to see them so excited about being out and <br/>\ndoing something like this.  We got back up to the top floor with her <br/>\ncamera and it was still there.  She took lots of pictures of it and  <br/>\nis now talking about trying to actually make a real outfit based on <br/>\nthat design.  I&#39;m going to have to really stretch myself to help her <br/>\nout on that since I&#39;m NOT good at sewing and the sewing machine <br/>\nintimidates me.  But I&#39;m determined to not model a bad attitude about <br/>\nit to her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a weaving wall, where you get these big rubbery things and <br/>\nweave them in and out of poles.  Matt did his weaving the &quot;right&quot; way <br/>\non one side and Luke did his own thing on his side of the wall.  When <br/>\nLuke was done he announced that he had made the place where Petey <br/>\npiranha lives (from Sunshine Mario). Then he got his model magic out <br/>\nof his bag (he ended up making Petey Piranha with model magic, lol) <br/>\nand Petey Piranha &quot;hatched&quot; out of his nest and went around the <br/>\nmuseum looking for places where he could eat dirt (it&#39;s a Sunshine <br/>\nMario thing).  We spent at least half an hour in the weaving <br/>\nwall/fabric designing area and had SO much fun with it.  It was <br/>\nanother area that made me say, &quot;Wow!&quot;  with comparing another group <br/>\nof kids.  It was either a school group or maybe even a homeschool <br/>\ngroup of very conservative Christian kids.  The girls all had long <br/>\nskirts and long hair pulled up in buns.  They came to the weaving <br/>\nwall, listened to the talk that the volunteer museum guide offered <br/>\nabout weaving, and dutifully each took a turn weaving exactly the way <br/>\nthey were &quot;supposed&quot; to.  Then they moved on to the next display.  I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t see much joy in their faces.  I was sad for them, because it <br/>\nwas a place that was REALLY conducive to joy and creativity.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLuke was hungry and wanted to go to the mcdonalds that they have in <br/>\nthe building, so we went and got him a kids&#39; meal.  Alisha wanted a <br/>\nkids meal for the toy, drink, and fries but didn&#39;t want the <br/>\ncheeseburger or nuggets, so I got it for her anyway. (and it ended up <br/>\nthat Luke was extra hungry--growth spurt?--and ate her <br/>\ncheeseburger).  I remembered that even hanging out at Mcdonalds can <br/>\nbe a fun place to be and learn so I didn&#39;t rush them through to get <br/>\nto the next &quot;educational&quot; part of the trip.  We hung out in Mcdonalds <br/>\nfor awhile and played with the toys and it was just a really happy <br/>\ntime.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got some fun stuff in the Crayola store and will have lots and <br/>\nlots of fun with them at home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe stopped at the Pez museum on the way to the parking garage and we <br/>\nfound that interesting. Alisha is now very interested in adding to <br/>\nour Pez dispenser collection.  (Which is cool because today while <br/>\nshopping in a grocery liquidation store I found 6 pez dispensers for <br/>\na quarter each that I bought to add to our collection and she was <br/>\nTHRILLED).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I&#39;m directionally challenged &lt;grin&gt;, I got us lost on the way <br/>\nhome.  When we were driving to Easton (the city where the Crayola <br/>\nfactory is) on route 22E, I mentioned to the kids that it said that <br/>\nEaston&#39;s  exit is the last exit in Pennsylvania.  Well, on the way <br/>\nback instead of getting on route 22 W I somehow ended up in the next <br/>\ncity--which is in New Jersey.  I found my way onto route 22W in that <br/>\ncity, but had to pay a 75 cent toll to get back into Pennsylvania.  <br/>\nWe laughed when we saw the &quot;Welcome to Pennsylvania&quot; sign.  Luke <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Way to waste our money, Mom&quot; in a way that wasn&#39;t rude or <br/>\ndisrespectful but just kind of dry humor.  It was especially funny to <br/>\nhear that kind of dry humor from a 5 year old, and very cool for me <br/>\nto realize that he understood that we crossed a state line and came <br/>\nback over it again and paid a toll to do so.  I was glad that, even <br/>\nthough I was kind of stressed out until I knew where I was going, I <br/>\nkept talking to the kids and let them know what was going on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe stopped at a pizza place on the way home.  The placemats were maps <br/>\nof Italy, and Luke wanted to know if it was a map of all the pizza <br/>\nplaces you could go to. ;)  I explained that since this is an Italian <br/>\nrestaurant they had a map of Italy. Luke said okay, but he was going <br/>\nto pretend it&#39;s a map of pizza places.  Alisha read some of the facts <br/>\non the map to Matt, and they started being goofy and changing the <br/>\nnames of things to silly names.  After we ate our pizza we shared a <br/>\nlarge cannoli.  It was the first time they&#39;d ever eaten a Cannoli and <br/>\nwe all enjoyed it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got home and they told their dad all about their day before he <br/>\nwent to bed, and then we did our usualy night time routine of me <br/>\nreading to Alisha and Matt and rubbing Luke&#39;s back to help him get to <br/>\nsleep.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104426,"nextTopicId":104347}}
