Still does from this experience.  When someone asks me about my dd I don&#39;t want to say &quot;no she is not reading yet...when, in fact, she is reading...just at an earlier place on the yardstick so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nDanielle Wrote: &lt;&lt;I don&#39;t know exactly why she will cross that threshold, but I do *know* that she will, and part of that confidence comes from being able to see the &quot;reading&quot; in what she&#39;s doing right now.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nExactly...i see so clearly the reading my dd&#39;s doing right now...i have learned to communicate the subtle changes to my dh along the way as his anxiety is greater than my own and he questions the idea of not spending &quot;time&quot; on &quot;subjects.&quot;  It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t spend time on subjects - it&#39;s just not that clearly defined as such - and certainly when my dd does ask to &quot;work&quot; on something specific - we do it the way she requests.

So often, I hear from my daughter&#39;s friends about how she needs to go to school because she can&#39;t read yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust last night my 5 year old niece told me she doesn&#39;t like homeschooling because &quot;you don&#39;t learn anything&quot;.  (My brother pulled her out of school bec. he couldn&#39;t get her to half day kindergarden so she stays with us.  Next year she&#39;ll go to 1st grade).<br/>\n<br/>\nSomehow I think she is parroting something my brother said.  oh WELL.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8 year old *is*moving in the direction of reading, but she is definetly not fluent.  She can read Green Eggs and Ham, and even has to sound out some of the words.  But there is definitely an element of memorization and recognition there.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, thats way more than last year.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe interesting thing is I&#39;m a girl scout leader of a Junior Troop.  The girls are &quot;4th, 5th, and 6th grade&quot; ages.  Mine are the only homeschoolers.  And some of these girls in this troop can&#39;t read any better than my 8 year old mentioned above.  Those who struggle with reading are as old as 5th grade, but most are 4th.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd math?  Forget it!  They are memorizing things and only know how to use those things in the context school gives them.  Ask them to apply it to a situation outside of a classroom or worksheet and they can&#39;t do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nReminds me of the &quot;10th&quot; grader who didn&#39;t know the difference between a half dollar and a state specific quarter.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen, who is SOOOOO very glad we are unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"rambling long and far, was Re: writings of a pre-reading 5 yo.","postDate":"1082739352","msgId":93076,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwMy40M2Y3NjlhNy4yZGJhYTQ5OEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":93084,"prevInTime":93075,"nextInTime":93077,"topicId":93076,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Funny - after i read sandra s comment i wrote a note of instruction for my dd.  she looked at me like i was cockoo...i read it to her...i know she could ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-208318086\">-=-Funny - after i read sandra&#39;s comment i wrote a note of instruction for my <br/>\ndd.  she looked at me like i was cockoo...i read it to her...i know she could <br/>\nread it if she wanted to focus her attention on it - ...but she didn&#39;t...she <br/>\nmade sure her dad understood my instructions before i left the house.&lt;g&gt;-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t leave a note if an older person were there.  By this...<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; &gt; If a parent can&#39;t leave a carefully printed note for a child that <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;has  important information and know that the child can read it and <br/>\n&gt;act accordingly, I  don&#39;t think the child can read.<br/>\n &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I meant if you have to leave and when the child wakes up can read a note from <br/>\nyou and know where you are so they can call or know when you&#39;ll be back.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems a minor difference, maybe, but I wouldn&#39;t leave a to-do list for a <br/>\nnew reader.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI might leave a note that says &quot;I went to the store at 9:00 and if you have <br/>\nproblems call Jeff at 256-4568 or dad at work.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s beyond a child&#39;s comprehension,  I would say &quot;not yet reading.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t say it to be punitive or to suggest phonics practice and wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nchange a thing about my life.  I&#39;ve had three kids who were at points both <br/>\nbefore and after the ability to read a serviceable note like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my personal threshhold is a real, live note because in all these <br/>\nunschooling discussions we can&#39;t help but compare when kids were able to do what.  <br/>\nIf someone says a child read at three and someone else says ten, the ages are <br/>\npretty easy to grasp from the outside, but the definition of reading isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school &quot;reading&quot; is often not really reading.  It&#39;s exercises, recitation, <br/>\nlists of reading words (these ten words by Friday), or repetition of the same <br/>\nreading lesson or little story that everyone in the class  has been repeating <br/>\nfor days.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly wrote long before she could read.  She would sound out words or ask how <br/>\nto spell words, and then read back what she had written.   But if I wrote <br/>\nsomething else, even if it had the same words she had used, she wouldn&#39;t have <br/>\nbeen able to read it.  So her &quot;reading&quot; was a review of the notation for her <br/>\nknown phrases.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn first grade we learned the pledge of allegiance and we had it written down <br/>\nat our desks.  We could &quot;read&quot; from that but it wasn&#39;t really reading, not <br/>\neven for me and I was the best reader in the class.  It was remembering phrases, <br/>\nand having my memory jogged by words I DID know and what came next.<br/>\n<br/>\nA paragraph with &quot;indivisible,&quot;  &quot;allegiance,&quot; &quot;republic,&quot; &quot;justice&quot; and  <br/>\n&quot;nation&quot; in other contexts would have been FAR beyond me.  I only &quot;knew&quot; those <br/>\nwords in that one context.  It was a more difficult version of Hop on Pop.  And <br/>\nby more difficult, I partly mean made way, way less sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are probably adults who don&#39;t really know the individual words of that <br/>\npledge or who couldn&#39;t explain in their own words what those things really <br/>\nmean.  And if they do think about it, it&#39;s embarrassing to be performing what is <br/>\nbasically a religious-style ceremony that contains bald-faced lies.  &quot;Liberty <br/>\nand justice for all&quot;?  Define &quot;all&quot; and try  not to have a stroke.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the idea of &quot;reading&quot; is not so easily measured.   So when I myself <br/>\ndiscuss it, I bring out my personal yardstick which says &quot;whatever&quot; and &quot;reading <br/>\nreadiness&quot; all along the end where they can tell Burger King from McDonald&#39;s and <br/>\ncan recite One Fish, Two Fish when they see the pictures.   And then there&#39;s a <br/>\nline across the ruler when they can read something simple they&#39;ve never seen <br/>\nbefore.  And then it goes on up to reading aloud weird stuff they&#39;ve never <br/>\nseen and not stumbling too badly on a foreign phrase as long as it&#39;s French, <br/>\nSpanish or Latin.  (Non-transcribed Chinese and Greek I save for those who are off <br/>\nmy scale &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93137,"nextTopicId":93134}}
