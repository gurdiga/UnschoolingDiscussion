This is about school and fitting into school. <br/>\n I&#39;m sorry you carried that over into unschooling.  Labels very often do more <br/>\nharm than good.  Bi-polar is another form of &quot;I&#39;m depressed sometimes and happy <br/>\nother times&quot;.  There are some people for whom those feelings are extreme.  One <br/>\nof the very important aspects of unschooling that is solely on the parents, is <br/>\nto create a happy learning environment.  Kids don&#39;t learn nearly as well when <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t happy.  It doesn&#39;t mean that every person needs to be happy at every <br/>\nmoment of every day, it means that things that create happy momentum should be <br/>\nparamount from day to day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf going to concerts with friends is something that creates happiness, do more <br/>\nof that.  If staying at home without friends creates unhappiness, do less of <br/>\nthat.

I was NOT a supportive mom in her choice, I did not make her choice as easy as I could of for her and I regret that.  I told her how pointless the assignments were, and gave her my opinion on everything.  She quit school and  came home but she wasn&#39;t 100% happy, in DSM there are very few people home during the day that she has much if anything in common with.  Every night she was happy and was busy with friends & activities, but during the day I just wasn&#39;t meeting her needs.  I feel like I tried everything, she just really wanted to be with her peers all the time.  I look back and wish I would have done better, I wish I would have been more respectful of her choices, even the one I didn&#39;t agree with.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, she is 13 now and trying again.  This year I have a whole new attitude towards school and am being 100% supportive. In fact she told me if she wants to quit that I have to make her finish out the year.  Not sure if I&#39;d be able to do that. I said &quot;what if you tell me you want to go part time&quot;, she said &quot;let me!&quot; :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she went at age 11 and having been unschooled almost her entire life she did fine.  She was not the math whiz (speed wise) and that frustrated my type A child, over time (probably a short time) she would have done even better.  Poor handwriting really frustrated her too and this past year she has written  A LOT!  She copies pages of books in journals!  And she is much more confident about her handwriting.  But that&#39;s just her, some kids may not care.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Lydia went to school my son then 9 wanted to go too.  I signed him up for a Montessori school (which I was much more supportive of because it was more in line with my schooling philosophies) and he lasted the entire year.  Of course he just went for PE and lunch (bwg) but even that eventually bored him.  He is still home and enjoying himself and not interested in going this year even tho his sister is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I signed Lydia up they wanted to do a placement test (both times) the first time I argued the point of test and really just probably seemed over the top and made no point to people who are working for the school.  This time I just said, let&#39;s just put her in class and see how she does, if there&#39;s a problem we&#39;ll go from there.   The school was like, &quot;OK.&quot;  That&#39;s it, no big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, in 8th grade (which is the grade she&#39;s in) they do their ITBS testing and she will have to take it (have to is probably strong, I could fight it)  I however will not have to make a big deal about it...and I won&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Iowa, they offer the possibility to dual enroll, where one can go part time and pick and chose their classes?  Maybe talk to him about that?  That might meet his needs?  At the high school age, they seem to have a little more choices in their schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have choices in the schools that he goes too?  Are there some charter schools, montessori or free schools that might be more in line with your philosophies?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-What I am most fearful of is the school&#39;s refusal to allow my<br/>\nchildren to school as &quot;we choose&quot;. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t make my mistake, let your kids come up with their own ideas about school.  The reality is some kids don&#39;t mind the hoop jumping so they can be with friends all day.  School does work for a lot of kids, I&#39;m not arguing that it&#39;s an ideal place to be but just that not everyone has the same take on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand wanting your kids home, but take Jenny&#39;s advice:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You can support your kids as people even when you don&#39;t like the choices they<br/>\nmake.

We decided to purchase each when we could along with some excellent dvd&#39;s from Homespun Tapes.  A gentle introduction to an interest.  She loves being free to design her own end game, create, and lead her own process.  Interest in learning, and choice are critical.    She will acquire and advance the skills she desires as she deems and is free to request additional resources if she would like them.  It&#39;s ok if she changes course or changes her mind.  I expect she will.  I do it all the time. As a matter of fact, she has morphed by discovering she loves writing songs more than instrument accompaniant to established work....She is in process -- gathering information about herself and her interests and most importantly, how she would like to pursue and express those interests.   There are many ways to explore a thing....I try not to get married to one way or the &quot;right way&quot; and encourage others to do the same.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt may help those who are advising that your children stick with their lessons to understand the child&#39;s resistance if you frame it in this way ----  Your partner, who loves you dearly, has decided to sign you up for something he believes will be a great learning experience, enrich your life, and hopes you will enjoy  -- all without your consent (?) (could also be with!) In addition to scheduled class time, there is outside class work required to reinforce and progress your developing skills. Even if it was something you initially /always wanted to try -- your time, freedom, preferences, and choice have been, well, kind of hijacked.  You are no longer in control but being led, albeit gently, down a path designed by another even though they may have your best interests at heart.  Although you could love the experience and even be thankful that someone else gifted you with handling the details of the experience, you could also find out that it was not what you expected, not how you wanted to experience or learn the thing, decide that you would like to devote your time to other interests instead...or have a host of other discoveries unique to you (and all valid learning experiences in my book). <br/>\n <br/>\nIf it happened that you changed your mind about this learning experience that your dear one arranged for you... (or even you arranged for you) I believe your input would be respected by your loved ones who would, of course, ideally honor your feelings, believing only you genuinely know you. People opt out of experiences that do not suit them all the time --jobs, relationships, learning paths, etc. It&#39;s necessary and healthy to grow responsibility for your own well being with confidence in your choices. A child&#39;s choices matter, too. That is how they grow and learn about themselves, their world, their options. Discuss, debate, and discover with them.<br/>\n  <br/>\nIt comes down to trusting, believing, honoring, respecting, talking, and listening to those you care about.  All will discover things, feel things, learn things  -- sometimes differently than expected.  If one requires or forces someone to do something, still, the lesson outcome is up for grabs with a possible dose of resentment thrown in.  <br/>\n <br/>\nLearning is always a process, not merely an end game.  I try to find the many possibilities of the journey exciting ,or, at the very least, interesting...and accept that the ending might be different than one I would choose to imagine.
