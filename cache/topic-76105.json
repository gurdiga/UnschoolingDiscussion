If I thought a game or book or puzzle or<br/>\nfree concert was VERY cool and my kid (Kirby at first) dragged his feet<br/>\nand looked the other way or just say &quot;I don&#39;t like this, mom,&quot; I took it<br/>\npersonally and felt rejected and incompetent.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure I feel the exact same thing but I do feel something. I think<br/>\nit&#39;s more along the lines that the kid isn&#39;t enjoying something I think they<br/>\n&quot;should&quot; be enjoying. Maybe I do feel a rejection of some sorts for not<br/>\nenjoying what *I* think is fun. It&#39;s just like with the owl pellets. I<br/>\nthought they were so neat and the kids did too when I asked if they wanted<br/>\nthem. Joseph lasted 20 minutes and was totally over them. Of course when<br/>\nit&#39;s something *he* finds interesting wild horses wouldn&#39;t pull him away. I<br/>\nguess what&#39;s easier, at least for me, is having my kids enjoy like minded<br/>\nactivities. Joseph is totally into things I&#39;m not. I just really need to be<br/>\naware of his needs and follow all his ideas as far as supply goes. It&#39;s not<br/>\neasy sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76101,"nextTopicId":76111}}
