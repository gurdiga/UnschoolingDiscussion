We do want SOMEONE to do these things <br/>\nbecause they are badly needed.  But if we don&#39;t value these jobs and<br/>\nthink of <br/>\nthem as undesireable, it seems like we are using these people.

I&#39;ve had a similar discussion with my mom and she can&#39;t get away<br/>\nfrom thinking that doctors and lawyers are &quot;smarter&quot; than auto mechanics.<br/>\n I heard a homeschooling mother say she&#39;s hs&#39;ing so her kids won&#39;t grow<br/>\nup to be hairdressers.  If I had a child who loved doing things to hair,<br/>\nI&#39;d be thrilled for them to make a career of it.  I hope my children <br/>\nwill *enjoy* whatever thing they choose to spend most of their time<br/>\ndoing.  Not that it will always be easy or fun, but that overall it will<br/>\ngive them pleasure.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true, but I heard once that garbage collecters as a<br/>\ngroup have a high level of job satisfaction bc they know their job is so<br/>\nimportant!<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nIf you want to do everything yourself,<br/>\ninsist on being the only one who can do it right.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>\nTry Juno Web: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3885,"nextTopicId":3916}}
