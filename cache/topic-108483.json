Some <br/>\ndays (rarely) I do it all at once, but usually, one hour of jogging <br/>\nlasts all day.  But I do believe jumping on and off the trampoline is <br/>\ngreat exercise, too!   Another plus,  no extra cost to your electric <br/>\nbill and it goes room to room or under the bed in a snap.  I try to <br/>\n&quot;sell&quot; it to everyone who wants to lose weight cause there&#39;s no way you <br/>\ncan go wrong with the purchase if you have small kids in the house. <br/>\n I&#39;ve even seen kids catalogs selling them.  Anyway,  the best thing is <br/>\nall that extra energy you get as you lose weight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I told my girls that I wanted to lose weight, they were so upset. <br/>\n One of them actually started to cry.  She said the I just wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nme anymore if I looked different.  I explained that I wanted to be <br/>\nbouncier and feel like playing more often, and now they can see that <br/>\nit&#39;s true.  It&#39;s so important to me to set a good example of working <br/>\ntoward a healthy body...not just a skinny one.  But most days, I still <br/>\nhave to talk myself into it and leave little notes around reminding me <br/>\nwhy I need to take care of myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also started a journal of all the calories, protein, and calcium I <br/>\nate.  It was a real pain to keep track, but it got easier with the <br/>\nhabit.  I didn&#39;t intend to limit myself, just to get an idea of what was <br/>\nreally going in me.  I think that awareness has helped a lot.  I&#39;ve been <br/>\nworried about how over 9 years of nursing babies will effect my bones as <br/>\nI get older.  It&#39;s also started a lot of conversations with the girls <br/>\nabout what&#39;s in certain foods and how those ingredients will affect our <br/>\nhealth and our emotions.  My second dd has always had wild mood swings <br/>\nand now she&#39;s starting to learn how lack of protein can effect her <br/>\nability to cope with things.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.  Go buy a trampoline!  <br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi Case<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca Benson wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; badolbilz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ynxn96@...\">ynxn96@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-I&#39;ve recently lost about 35 pounds jogging on my <br/>\n&gt; mini-trampoline...and best of all, the moment you step off, it&#39;s an <br/>\n&gt; awesome toy for the kids.-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations!

Our <br/>\ntrampoline lives in the middle of the living room floor because someone <br/>\nalways wants it.
