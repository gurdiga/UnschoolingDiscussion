When I<br/>\nsee the lights I take an antihistamine and can avert the pain most times.<br/>\n When the warning doesn&#39;t come first the antihistamines only &quot;dull&quot; the<br/>\npain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard (never tried it) that putting a cold pack on your head and<br/>\nneck with your feet in hot water helps by pulling the blood away from the<br/>\nhead helps a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as &quot;voices&quot;, a few days ago I kept hearing a bell that no one else<br/>\nseemed to hear.  My daughter got a LOT of mileage out of that one!  Until<br/>\nshe heard it too, then we discovered it was a window lock that had fallen<br/>\non the ground and the cats were tossing it around.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n\r<br/>\n________________________________________________________________\r<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today\r<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!\r<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47571,"nextTopicId":47557}}
