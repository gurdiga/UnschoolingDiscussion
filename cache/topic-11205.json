One<br/>\nway that they do it is by their psych testing. They<br/>\nbeging to diagnose the HSers with ADD and then say<br/>\nthat they need to be in ps where the psychs. can help<br/>\nthem and help medicate the kids. I am sure there are<br/>\nother ways they do this but this is the most common I<br/>\nhave heard of. Also the ps gets a certain amount of<br/>\nmoney from the govn&#39;t for the hsers who are using<br/>\ntheir curriculum and facilities. So even though you<br/>\nare hsing the school still benefits off you as a<br/>\nhs&#39;er. I personally don&#39;t like this idea.
