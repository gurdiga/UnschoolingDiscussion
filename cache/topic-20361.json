When we moved out of King<br/>\nCounty, we sold our land with our 20 year old mobile home for just about<br/>\nenough to cover our beautiful new house here in Oregon. During the time that<br/>\nwe lived there, we went from being on a dead-end dirt road to being smack in<br/>\nthe middle of $500k per house developments. Scary! My advice if you&#39;re<br/>\nlooking to locate a community is to be very sure about what is going in<br/>\naround you. It made such a huge difference to our quality of life when our<br/>\nlittle dirt-road became a major paved thoroughfare for all the yuppies<br/>\nzipping by in their Range Rovers at 50 mph (even though it was still<br/>\nsupposedly &quot;residential&quot; and a 25 mph speed limit. And none of the new<br/>\ndivisions put in sidewalks, so we could no longer walk on our road with our<br/>\nkids. Everything in that area of Washington is booming with new<br/>\ndevelopments, so be very careful what/where you buy!<br/>\nAlso, if you get the opportunity, go and visit &quot;Sharingwood&quot; community in<br/>\nBothell. They went through a ton in trying to get their (now very<br/>\nsuccessful) community off of the ground, and in dealing with permits, land<br/>\nuse restriction, etc. for this sort of development. I&#39;m sure they could give<br/>\nyou lots of great advice about putting together a community in Washington.<br/>\nYou should be able to find a contact by doing a web search.<br/>\n<br/>\n Blue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) who has a best friend named &quot;Eiznekcam&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) the girl who climbs everything!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20232,"nextTopicId":20211}}
