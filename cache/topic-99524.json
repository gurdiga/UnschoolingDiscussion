That what I did and boy did the unschoolers and wanna-be&#39;s come out in droves!  Almost 60 unschooling families just north of Austin, and 35 in South/Central Austin.  I think exclusive unschooling groups are of the utmost importance.  However, when unschoolers have only knows religious based-gotta-sign-a-statement-of-faith groups, they often just want a group of homeschoolers where everyone is welcome.  I think nothing is as uplifting to an unschooling family as a whole as spending time with other unschooling families.  In inclusive groups, discussion always quickly slides to curriculum use and schedules.  Bleck!  People found that our desire to have an exclusive group was harsh and mean at first, but they don&#39;t think so anymore.  I am on a few inclusive lists, though, and each time unschooling gets mentioned, everyone batters the unschooler.  There&#39;s a huge need for unschooling-only lists and groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo go go!

I don&#39;t get into curriculum conversations.<br/>\nI also avoid any discussions of religion. If someone starts going on about<br/>\nhow they &quot;have to&quot; limit TV, I shrug and tell them that Jayn is free to<br/>\nwatch anything she wants any time, and that she doesn&#39;t crave it, and that<br/>\nit is a choice that the parents are making. Jayn sure doesn&#39;t seem to spend<br/>\nher time talking to the other kids about TV shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people evidently feel superior to me because they are taking a<br/>\nstrong stance against for example candies (gasp), but their feelings will<br/>\nmake no change in how we live. Also it is really rare to have differences<br/>\ncanvassed in a heated manner at our group. I always say that Jayn can eat<br/>\nwhatever she wants whenever she wants. They look at me with evident<br/>\nsuspicion, and then they hear Jayn say &quot;no thanks&quot; to a cookie and ask for<br/>\nan apple and they look perplexed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne usually nice woman was impinging on her child&#39;s enjoyment by being what<br/>\nI saw as quite pissy about the kid getting her feet wet. I didn&#39;t use that<br/>\nrude word to her, but I did say something about how Jayn loved getting wet<br/>\nany time. The other mother didn&#39;t have another pair of shoes with her, BUT<br/>\nshe told me that was deliberate because she doesn&#39;t like having to &quot;deal<br/>\nwith&quot; wet feet. Naturally Jayn was already soaking at the same park. <br/>\n<br/>\nI related to her the story of how Jayn wanted to play squirt bottles with<br/>\nice water with me some nights before, so we each filled a bottle with water<br/>\nfrom the fridge, and went into the bathroom in our clothes and squirted each<br/>\nother and the mirror with great enjoyment (and some discomfort - brrr) for<br/>\nabout half an hour before getting out of our sopping garments and having a<br/>\nwarm bath. She did look at me like I was kinda nuts, but maybe that story<br/>\nwould have her thinking of the relative ease of wet feet or shoes, and how<br/>\nsimple willingness to be inconvenienced can end up creating a wonderful<br/>\nmemory.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the support groups are not play-focused - by which I mean that they have<br/>\nregularly scheduled park days where the kids just play freely together -<br/>\nthen they must be focused on something else. If that is academic classes it<br/>\nmay not be a supportive environment for an Unschooler. If that is craft<br/>\nactivities, beware of the thin edge of the wedge - and a lot depends on the<br/>\npersonality of the activity leader. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it is group outings to places, maybe only choose to go on the &quot;field<br/>\ntrips&quot; (schoolish language :P~) that are of interest to your kids, and be<br/>\naware that the host of the museum (or whatever) will probably treat the<br/>\ngroup as if they were school kids, with clipboards of special (often dumb)<br/>\nactivities to be completed, and a set agenda. It makes a difference to have<br/>\na high ratio of parents to kids, however, especially when the parents are<br/>\njust as interested as the kids in the bugs or bones or exploding soda cans<br/>\nor whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the focus is religious education or discussion, then that is a decision<br/>\nthe parents must debate themselves. Be aware that many of the religious<br/>\ngroups state openly that they are there to support the correct use of<br/>\nreligiously based academic curricula, especially in the sciences. If you are<br/>\n*looking* for that you are probably not an Unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy purpose in being a member of a local group is first to find playmates for<br/>\nJayn from amongst gently parented kids. The distant second is to find, if<br/>\nnot lifelong deep friendships for myself, then at least congenial<br/>\nacquaintances. The languishing third is to have easier access to some places<br/>\nthat have group discounts and are more fun to attend in a group. I get my<br/>\nemotional and intellectual support (despite this not being the intended<br/>\npurpose) from this list, and its sisters UnschoolingBasics, and<br/>\nAlwaysLearning. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
