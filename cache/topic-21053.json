My son who is mildly hypoglycemic (has wild mood<br/>\nswings, for one thing, if his blood sugar is not evened out) loves and<br/>\ncraves &quot;green&quot; juice!

Those<br/>\n&gt; who do not have extraordinary children often do not<br/>\n&gt; understand why the routine measures they take with<br/>\n&gt; great success will not work for everybody else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>LOL, ain&#39;t this is the truth! I&#39;m on a &quot;due date list&quot; for each of my kids<br/>\nwhere all the babies were due in the same month and the solutions that they<br/>\nhave suggested like &quot;sing a special song to make teeth brushing time fun&quot;<br/>\njust always baffled me. My son (before we figured out how to eliminate most<br/>\nof his sensory issues) equated teeth brushing to being branded with hot<br/>\nirons and no amount of special songs was going to change that perception. It<br/>\ntook a heck of a lot of creativity, time, energy, etc. to get through even<br/>\nthe tiniest simplest every day routines. Whew! Exhausting. Now that I have<br/>\nmy daughter, I understand why they made those suggestions. Not that she<br/>\nisn&#39;t challenging in her own ways (mostly because, like her mother, she&#39;s a<br/>\nfireball, a climber, a daredevil), but in every day life, things are pretty<br/>\ndarn easy. When it&#39;s time to put shoes on, she sits down and puts her shoes<br/>\non. No screaming about &quot;sock squishies!!!!&quot;. When it&#39;s time to wash her<br/>\nhair, she puts her head back and lets me do it. I feel so bad for my son<br/>\nthat everything had to be so much harder for him than for average kids. I<br/>\ncan also see how kids like this can raise the level of stress in parenting<br/>\nto a high that most folks will never understand. When it literally takes an<br/>\nhour to get your kid dressed in the morning because of all the &quot;issues&quot;, it<br/>\ncan try the patience of even a saint! And of course everyone has opinions<br/>\nabout how you&#39;re &quot;coddling&quot; them and &quot;catering&quot; to their wishes, because<br/>\nthey don&#39;t understand how very hard things are for a kid with differing<br/>\nabilities. I used to think that if my son was paralyzed in a wheelchair,<br/>\nno-one would be insisting that I force him to dress himself with his wasted<br/>\nlimbs, but because he has these invisible coordination problems, they<br/>\nsomehow think I should be pushing him to do something he simply cannot do.<br/>\nDitto with potty training and a million other issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Eileen writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think that this is true.  I think it is hard for<br/>\n&gt;people with &#39;normal&#39; kids to understand that tactics<br/>\n&gt;have to be changed for a child whose reactions to<br/>\n&gt;normal stimuli are counter-intuitive.  Finding a way<br/>\n&gt;to convey love to a baby or child who hates to be<br/>\n&gt;cuddled or touched at all is a challenge most people<br/>\n&gt;would have trouble even imagining.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is so true.
