The problem was that I couldn&#39;t NOT read what I <br/>\nsaw on the neighboring pages, and I couldn&#39;t NOT read the definitions of the <br/>\nmost interesting pictures I saw on the way there.  And sometimes those led to <br/>\nlooking something else up, or going to the Indo-European appendix (American <br/>\nHeritage has been my fave since I was fifteen).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hear my kids hesitating when I say &quot;Let&#39;s look it up on Google!&quot;  They want <br/>\nthe five second answer sometimes, not the &quot;OH MY GOSH!  Come look at THIS!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut sometimes the twenty minute answer is fun for them too.<br/>\n<br/>\nDictionaries were less attention-sucking after I knew more.  It just took a <br/>\ndecade or so for all the pages to have been glanced at so I wasn&#39;t going to <br/>\nopen it up and say &quot;I didn&#39;t know THIS was here!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat will never happen with google.<br/>\nI&#39;m doomed to it taking me twenty minutes to look anything up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also write reports sometimes!  We wanted t find a picture of Helen Keller, <br/>\nand I filled a document file up with ten photos and several quotes, in <br/>\nchronological order, from seven or ten websites, for Holly to look at the <br/>\nnext morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was that about ADHD? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre we surprised that schools are 300 thousand years behind the times (or 30 <br/>\nmillion or whatever it was)?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the problem in our world is the concept of discipline (relating in <br/>\nall directions--land ownership, slavery, women&#39;s legal status through the <br/>\nages, powers of kings) and that&#39;s So much bigger politically speaking than <br/>\neven the English speaking &quot;Western World,&quot; so looking at that is daunting to <br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I settle for the little models in freedom and respect which are afforded <br/>\nby changing our relationships with our children from the cultural norm of <br/>\nthem being obedient without question to their being partners in exploration.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that&#39;s a  column bubbling up to the surface.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI resisted watching Gone with the Wind my whole life until Friday.  I&#39;m 2/3 <br/>\nthrough (the point where so many have famously fallen asleep in the past, I <br/>\nguess), but thanks to the marvels of modern technology I didn&#39;t have to snore <br/>\nin a crowded theatre during the depression.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad I saw it AFTER I was aware of the sociological take on the role of <br/>\nthe southern U.S. in western civilization, and that is that they were trying <br/>\nin many ways to re-create feudal Europe in a post-Renaissance world.    <br/>\nWatching it through those eyes helped mesee things I would have ignored if I <br/>\nhad been familiar with the movie.   And it helps explain some of the <br/>\nmysterious power of religion in so many people from that part of the country <br/>\ntoo.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore my ancestors were all Texans they were from the SE, not further north <br/>\nthan Virginia, except for ONE Yankee (brace yourselves).  My maternal <br/>\ngrandmother was from a second union.  Her mother&#39;s respectable Texas husband, <br/>\nthe father of her brothers, had died.  Her mother married again and had two <br/>\ngirls.  Their father was from *Michigan.*   <br/>\n<br/>\nTo them that was as foreign as Boston! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHis last name was Houghton.  Turns out that&#39;s a prominent name in Michigan, <br/>\nand I bet they never knew where he had gone.  &quot;Black sheep,&quot; my granny said; <br/>\n&quot;ran away to Texas.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s why I can&#39;t use Google without learning something different, <br/>\nbecause I learned a long time ago to use distraction to my advantage.  Maybe <br/>\nADHD is a great HELP to unschooling because it keeps someone from finishing <br/>\nthe one thing they intended to do and then needing a prompt or permission or <br/>\nan invitation to jump track to something related, or opposite.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":29149646,"authorName":"The Resourceful Homeschooler","from":"The Resourceful Homeschooler &lt;rickag@...&gt;","profile":"rhgerstmann","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: New Study Shows ADHD Useful","postDate":"1024840978","msgId":38569,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5M0IyMzIyLjREQjIlUmlja2FAcmVzb3VyY2VmdWxob21lc2Nob29sZXIuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjQ3NTMxMjkuMzU1LjQyOTcyLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38550,"nextInTopic":38570,"prevInTime":38568,"nextInTime":38570,"topicId":38535,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
