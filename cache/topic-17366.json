Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;   I have 3 sons - 10 and  7 years old  and 18<br/>\n&gt; months. I was wondering if<br/>\n&gt;   anyone had suggestions of books they found that<br/>\n&gt; their sons enjoyed. My<br/>\n&gt;   boys are really into adventure stories, and<br/>\n&gt; anything that makes them<br/>\n&gt;   laugh. I&#39;m looking for read together books and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;read by themselves&quot;<br/>\n&gt;   books (2nd grade level). Also my oldest son is<br/>\n&gt; really interested in wars<br/>\n&gt;   and battles. In fact this leads to another<br/>\n&gt; question- does the war thing<br/>\n&gt;   ever cease or should I be getting prepared for the<br/>\n&gt; day he&#39;ll tell me he<br/>\n&gt;   is enlisting? He tells me he is not interested in<br/>\n&gt; being in the army , he<br/>\n&gt;   just wants to produce a movie about a war. Which<br/>\n&gt; brings me to my last<br/>\n&gt;   question- does anyone have any ideas of how I can<br/>\n&gt; expose him to movie<br/>\n&gt;   productions and such. I plan to do home videos of<br/>\n&gt; his &quot;movies&quot; but I<br/>\n&gt;   don&#39;t know how to expose him to professional<br/>\n&gt; settings. Anyway, I<br/>\n&gt;   appreciate any thoughts on the above questions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Karen<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Karen,<br/>\n&gt;   I don&#39;t know about boys much as I have daughters.<br/>\n&gt; However I do know this...they would enjoy the Hardy<br/>\n&gt; Boys mystery books. I still do and I&#39;m a female! I<br/>\n&gt; also enjoyed the Bobbsey Twins mysteries and am<br/>\n&gt; enjoying the Boxcar children series. As to Wars, let<br/>\n&gt; him read stories on old wars such as the crimean<br/>\n&gt; wars, civil wars and even the most recent ones. He<br/>\n&gt; will get an idea of what war really is like and how<br/>\n&gt; devastating it can be. As to producing a movie, Have<br/>\n&gt; him do a pictorial panel and make a home movie out<br/>\n&gt; of that with a camcorder...maybe do a skit or a home<br/>\n&gt; theatre type thing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Jessica<br/>\n&gt;   Vaughnde Lee<br/>\n&gt;   Missoula, Montana<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stampinbookworm.eboard.com\">http://www.stampinbookworm.eboard.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
