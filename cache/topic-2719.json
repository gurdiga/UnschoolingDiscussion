One of my major problems is my own energy level.  Last year I found <br/>\nit very hard to stay motivated and do much more than prepare meals and keep <br/>\nhouse (not very well, I might add).  Turns out I was suffering from <br/>\ndepression, which is now under control.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell today we had a great day.  I worked at my church for 2 hours this <br/>\nmorning (as I do every morning) and while I was there, my girls, ages 7 and <br/>\n5, went down to the preschool.  There are a lot of learning activities down <br/>\nthere.  Afterwards, we picked up my boys, ages 13 and 11, and headed to the <br/>\nstore, Zany Brainy, where we proceeded to &quot;play&quot; for over 2 hours.  We <br/>\nexplored everything, played with a lot of things, read some books, and the <br/>\nkids even watched a video (Madeline).<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t have any money, so we didn&#39;t buy anything, but we made lists of what <br/>\nwe would have bought if we did have the money.
