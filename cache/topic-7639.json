Karen <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Karen,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe url for the farm website is <br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homepage.rconnect.com/winfarm\">http://homepage.rconnect.com/winfarm</a><br/>\n also if you are interested in getting monthly updates on the farm I <br/>\nhave a newsletter list with Onelist to subscribe to that go to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm</a> <br/>\nAll my newsletters are archived there and there are lots of up to <br/>\ndate photos from around the farm there too, with the most recent <br/>\none being a photo of a 3 day old baby goat we adopted yesterday <br/>\nwith his new &quot;mother&quot;, my daughter Rhianon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe farm is a bit like an old fashioned family farm, with a little bit of <br/>\neverything.  Over the years it has been a beef cattle farm and a <br/>\ndairy farm.  Now it is the local compost site... you should see the <br/>\ncows gobble up the grass clippings that people bring, and the <br/>\ngoats and sheep eat at fresh brush.   We also get food waste from <br/>\nthe local hospital and university, that is composted until we have a <br/>\nway to cook it so we can feed it to animals.  However we can feed <br/>\nthe outdated bakery, produce, dairy, and frozen goods that we get <br/>\ndaily from the local supermarket.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWe bottle feed dairy steers with the outdated milk.   My daughter <br/>\nmilks one of the 9 female goats and feeds the milk to two female <br/>\nkids and a buck kid we bought yesterday.  There are two wethers <br/>\nfrom last year, two bucks and 8 kids.   We bought 3  10month old <br/>\nangora goats last week, as we want to take up spinning... as if we <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t get enough fleeces from our 24 sheep and their 23 [so far] <br/>\nlambs.  We have 4 beef cows, 2 bred heifers and 3 younger heifers <br/>\n[the youngest is 7 days old], two bulls who will be going to market <br/>\nbefore the little heifers are much bigger, and 12 dairy steers from a <br/>\ncouple of weeks to almost two years old.  We also have 1 rabbit <br/>\nand one cat.  I almost forgot we have two sows, who due to their <br/>\nhuge appetites for doughnuts became too fat to breed, the vet isn&#39;t <br/>\nsure if they will ever be capable of reproducing, but they are very <br/>\nhappy pigs.... we are probably buying a bred sow soon, she will not <br/>\nbe allowed to eat baked goods!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two pairs of Canada geese, both geese are sitting on six <br/>\nor seven eggs, 5 domestic geese and a young Canada goose who <br/>\nthinks he&#39;s a domestic goose, 4 turkeys, six ducks [and 28 fertile <br/>\nduck eggs in an incubator], and too many chickens to count   We <br/>\nincubate chicks from our chicken&#39;s eggs in three incubators and <br/>\nlast week over 350 chicks hatched, all through summer we will <br/>\nkeep the incubators going, we can incubate 46 eggs a day, the <br/>\nexcess we sell at the local co-op and here on the farm, and most <br/>\nof the roosters the Hmongs buy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s about all the livestock.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe farm is 175 acres, but only 55 is tillable land, the rest is <br/>\nreturning to the way nature had intended it to be, and there is an <br/>\nabundance of wildlife.   There are two trout streams joining on the <br/>\nfarm, and beavers have been busy damming one of them, there are <br/>\ncoyotes, deer, skunks, squirrels, chipmonks, ground hogs and <br/>\nmany other critters living here.  There is a 600&#39; hill to climb.... a <br/>\ngreat exercise machine, and from the top you can see the <br/>\nMississippi River.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids [human ones] love it here and really enjoy helping out with <br/>\nthe farm tasks, they learn so much for the things the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
