So, we<br/>\nask the questions.  Did the child actually make the choice or did<br/>\npreconceived notions &quot;force&quot; the choice.   Was it an informed choice.  Was<br/>\nit a pressured choice.  Why did the child make the choice.  Were other<br/>\nchoices really considered or investigated.  Lots of questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nanandter@...\">nanandter@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 03, 2001 7:24 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:to choose or let them choose<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand the militant attitude of people on this who don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; understand my choices (or those of my children).

Lelia, who is 12 now, had decided <br/>\nshe &quot;needed&quot; more structure and so we bought a curriculumn at the beginning <br/>\nof this &quot;school&quot; year. Turns out she didn&#39;t need it at all, but she was able <br/>\ntodecid that. So it is an interesting question as to where that &quot;need for <br/>\nstructure&quot; comes from. She had gone to school the year before. . . her choice <br/>\nbecause we had just moved and she had been miserable the year before when we <br/>\nhad just moved then too, so she thought school would help out in making new <br/>\nfriends, etc. It did, but those were friends she didn&#39;t keep after she left <br/>\nthe school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think for her the seemingly &quot;need&quot; for structure was society <br/>\nplaced, or possibly even school placed, and I suppose even her family (myself <br/>\nincluded) pushed that thought at her. Now that she is totally unschooling, <br/>\nshe is the happiest I have ever seen her in her life. Her self-esteem is <br/>\nrising everyday, etc. . . . <br/>\n<br/>\nGood thought provoking question or idea even.<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\nIf you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself, and then <br/>\nmake a change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"X0Taqkt9nnGQvYNdiizVJQAvHvDUCWf9a9CIE4URlTLOUjmPAORM3WjdXocaVsFkC98pnz9PRCxL","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:to choose or let them choose","postDate":"991586646","msgId":22374,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM1LjE2MDRmNDUyLjI4NGJjMzU2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":22369,"nextInTopic":22375,"prevInTime":22373,"nextInTime":22375,"topicId":22368,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/3/01 8:27:08 AM, nanandter@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1581534900\">In a message dated 6/3/01 8:27:08 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nanandter@...\">nanandter@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  I don&#39;t understand the militant attitude of people on this who don&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand my choices (or those of my children).
