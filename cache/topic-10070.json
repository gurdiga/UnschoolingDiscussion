My question is,<br/>\nwhere have the church supported programs gone that used to help women left<br/>\nin difficult circumstances?  When a woman is left alone with children, it is<br/>\ngoing to be especially difficult for the children to have to spend the day<br/>\naway from mom.  If dad has just left, they need mom even more!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a mother *has* to work, then it is by far best (for the children) for<br/>\ntheir mother to work at home.  It is not always the easiest thing, but the<br/>\nneeds of children come before the desires of adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is the problem of starting a home business.  It does take time, and<br/>\nmom and the kids need to eat and pay bills in the meantime.  A few possible<br/>\nsolutions here.<br/>\nMom goes out to work part time while trying to establish a business.  If<br/>\nfriends care for the children during the day for no charge, then the high<br/>\ncost of day care is eliminated.  Stress can be relieved for the single mom<br/>\nby preparing a hot supper for her and her kids.  Maybe spend a weekend<br/>\nshowing her how to cook large batches of food and freeze them so inexpensive<br/>\nmeals are quickly available.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is family nearby then perhaps mom and kids could move in while she<br/>\ntries to establish a business.  Again, this is not always a wonderful<br/>\nchoice, but it is far easier on the children involved than being away from<br/>\nmom all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some church related organizations still around that help mothers<br/>\nto get back on their feet.  Not enough, but some.  Check in to these and<br/>\nfind help.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of us who are fortunate enough to be able to stay home, why aren&#39;t<br/>\nmore of us supporting these organizations?  Are we so busy that we can&#39;t<br/>\ngive one day a month to help hurting mothers stay with their kids??  Or is<br/>\nit that too many of us think that it just isn&#39;t that important for moms to<br/>\nraise their kids??  It comes down to what we value.  That which we value, we<br/>\nsupport.<br/>\n<br/>\nDia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37061,"nextTopicId":22697}}
