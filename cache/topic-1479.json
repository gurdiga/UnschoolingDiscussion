There seems to have been an evolution of sorts<br/>\nthat happened to us as we learned along. We are starting our 6th year. <br/>\nFor instance, when we first started I used to put up the Canadian flag (and<br/>\nsing our anthem) and have desks and have workbooks and have scheduled hours<br/>\nand so on. But we have GROWN!!! And we realize now that we needn&#39;t<br/>\nreplicate our schooling history from our own childhoods.  And I find that<br/>\nas the girls get older they are very integrated into the choice of the<br/>\nlearning materials. They have good self-esteem and they know that they can<br/>\nchoose the path. And they do... with great determination. I now only<br/>\nconsider myself a facilitator. They choose the path...I help with the<br/>\n&#39;building materials&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI still have days where I worry if I am doing enough but generally our<br/>\nlives seem so much smoother now that we are moving away from curriculum and<br/>\netc. <br/>\nOur provincial gov. supports homeschooling. In British COlumbia we advise<br/>\nthe gov. that we are hsing (called registering with the Ministry of<br/>\nEducation) and then we are absolutely free to do whatever we like. They are<br/>\nnever any tests done, never any home visits, never any reports to<br/>\nfile...absolutely no follow-up or Big Brother attitude.   And we hope to<br/>\nmaintain these freedoms. They are perfect for unschooling!!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are correct that unschooling is about relaxing. I think it comes with<br/>\nthe confidence that we are raising happy, inquisitive, spirited children. <br/>\n<br/>\nBrooke<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:44 AM 7/12/99 EDT, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RRAINENJ@...\">RRAINENJ@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m new to the list.
