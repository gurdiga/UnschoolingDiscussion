His reading and writing skill development was delayed and he began reading &#39;for real&#39; by about age ten. His learning journey made me realise how the emphasis on reading story books can harm emergent readers. <br/>\n<br/>\n      Maybe this emphasis on learning to read using fiction derives from the practice of reading the Bible - because it was the only book most families had a few hundred years ago and just about everyone learned to read by reading the Bible. Maybe somehow the whole idea was corrupted and educators figured that any old story would do... And then it became that stories were the best way to encourage reading, and now a whole publishing industry is built upon that premise. <br/>\n<br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\nwishing you peace and prosperity, <br/>\nBeverley Paine<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschoolaustralia.beverleypaine.com\">http://homeschoolaustralia.beverleypaine.com</a> and <br/>\nAlways Learning Books - www.alwayslearningbooks.com.au <br/>\nPO Box 371, Yankalilla 5203 South Australia<br/>\n<br/>\nSend a self-addressed, stamped envelope for a free getting started <br/>\nwith homeschooling information newsletter to the above address.<br/>\nRead latest Homeschool Australia blog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hablog.beverleypaine.com\">http://hablog.beverleypaine.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschoolaustralia.beverleypaine.com\">http://homeschoolaustralia.beverleypaine.com</a><br/>\nReceive regular tips about how easy homeschooling can be, as well as book reviews:<br/>\nemail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dailyhomeschoolingtips-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">dailyhomeschoolingtips-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107933,"nextTopicId":108012}}
