And as an<br/>\nexpert in registration and drop/add, I&#39;m here to tell you that if you<br/>\nor someone you know is thinking about attending college next Fall, NOW<br/>\nIS THE TIME TO START APPLYING FOR ADMISSION AND FINANCIAL AID.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s where today&#39;s TOURBUS stop comes in.  The Embark home page at<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.embark.com/&quot;\">http://www.embark.com/&quot;</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.embark.com/\">http://www.embark.com/</a> &lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nis a free, one-stop, higher educational portal that helps you find a<br/>\nUS community college, technical program, four-year college or<br/>\nuniversity, or graduate school that is right for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Embark home page has four main sections: undergraduate schools;<br/>\nbusiness schools (MBA or executive education programs); international<br/>\nstudents; and graduate schools.  Click on the appropriate section and<br/>\nyou are taken to a page that shows you the five steps you need to<br/>\nfollow to become a professional college student like me:<br/>\n<br/>\n     1. Research<br/>\n     2. Prepare<br/>\n     3. Apply<br/>\n     4. Finance<br/>\n     5. Get Ready<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where Embark shines.  The wealth of information that Embark<br/>\noffers in each of these steps is stunning.  For example, in step one<br/>\n(Research), Embark has a tool called &quot;Matchmaker.&quot;   By asking you a<br/>\nseries of questions about where you are interested in attending<br/>\ncollege, what type of program of study interests you, and so on,<br/>\nMatchmaker helps you find a college or group of colleges that is<br/>\nspecifically suited to you and your interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nCool, huh?  And the Matchmaker is just ONE of the tools available in<br/>\nthe Research section!<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have found school or group of schools that interests you, the<br/>\nnext step is to prepare for and take the college entrance<br/>\nexaminations.  Embark&#39;s &quot;Prepare&quot; section gives you free practice<br/>\ntests for the SAT, ACT, GMAT, and GRE.  The site also explains how<br/>\neach test works and tells you where you can turn for test prep<br/>\ntutorials and classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have taken the entrance exams, the next step is to fill out<br/>\nan admissions application (step three: Apply).  Through Embark you<br/>\ncan apply to a BUNCH of colleges online and Embark&#39;s Apply section<br/>\ngives you advice and information on how to improve your chance of<br/>\nadmission, how to write an admissions essay, and how to survive a<br/>\ncollege interview.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince a lot of parents ride our little bus of Internet happiness, I<br/>\nhave a feeling that the next section will probably be the most<br/>\npopular: Step four: Finance.  In the Finance section you can get<br/>\nadvice and information on how to pay for college, use tools to help<br/>\nyou find and apply for college loans, search and apply for<br/>\nscholarships, and even find out how to manage what little money you&#39;ll<br/>\nhave left after the bursar&#39;s office gets done with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe final section, &quot;Get Ready,&quot; gives you advice and information to<br/>\nhelp you gear up for college, including how to save money when you buy<br/>\nyour textbooks, how to choose a computer, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmbark is *NOT* perfect.  For example, Embark&#39;s Matchmaker doesn&#39;t<br/>\ninclude every school in the US, so its results may exclude some<br/>\nschools that might be a better match for you.  Because of this, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t recommend that you use Embark as the sole tool you use in<br/>\ndetermining which college to attend.  However, Embark is an AMAZING<br/>\nsite, it has a wealth of information, and it is a wonderful place to<br/>\nSTART researching and preparing for your new college career.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and yes, it did indeed take me 13 years to get my bachelors<br/>\ndegree.  But, if it is any consolation, I will receive my masters<br/>\ndegree in 13 months.  Now if only I could find a 13-week PhD program,<br/>\nthe symmetry will be complete.  :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14171,"nextTopicId":14173}}
