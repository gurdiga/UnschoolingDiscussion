I just bought vegetarian alternatives to add<br/>\nto the mix. So when I make spaghetti, I have noodles, sauce, cheese and<br/>\nmeatballs all separate and people combine whatever they want. I just add<br/>\nveggie meatballs as an option. For things like chili, I don&#39;t put meat in<br/>\nsometimes anyway (the beans provide plenty of protein). If I&#39;m in the mood<br/>\nfor meat, I just put some in another pot without meat or with a meat<br/>\nalternative. It dirties an extra pot, but it&#39;s not any extra work. Chicken<br/>\npatties, hotdogs, hamburgers all have veggie alternatives of course. Tacos<br/>\nare easy to do this with.  If I&#39;m doing a meal like roast chicken or beef,<br/>\nthen I just make sure there are quick and easy veggie &quot;meats&quot; available to<br/>\nheat up. Kate would do that herself.  I would make sure to do some<br/>\nvegetarian meals as well since we like that anyway.  As long as I have the<br/>\nalternatives handy, it wasn&#39;t&#39; much extra work. It is pricier though.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] re: attention vegetarians","postDate":"1132155296","msgId":109925,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI0My4xNzFjZDIxLjMwYWNhYmEwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":109906,"nextInTopic":109926,"prevInTime":109924,"nextInTime":109926,"topicId":109892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I tried some of that one time from the grocery store now that <br/>\nyou jogged my memory (they had a mini-freezer in the baked goods <br/>\nsection there where the sprouted grain bread resided so it would stay <br/>\nfresh - had a whole description on the package as to why and how they <br/>\ndo it the way they do, including quickly freezing it to keep it from <br/>\ngoing bad). Toasted it wasn&#39;t bad but as a general purpose item I <br/>\npersonally didn&#39;t care for it - flavor was okay, texture seemed &#39;off&#39; <br/>\nfor my taste. DH didn&#39;t mind it so much, DS wouldn&#39;t eat it. Maybe if <br/>\nwe hit a whole foods store (I&#39;ve been wanting an excuse to go to the <br/>\nnew Trader Joe&#39;s but at a 30 minute drive through the city it hasn&#39;t <br/>\nbeen a priority) and found a different brand that is flat out fresh <br/>\n(never frozen), that would likely be different. I know many breads <br/>\n(even basic may as well eat the wrapper white bread) lose a lot when <br/>\nfrozen then thawed. (I think the wrapper of the product even suggested <br/>\ntoasting it).<br/>\n<br/>\nI googled the brand name of the stuff we bought and this is what they <br/>\nsaid about the sprouting:<br/>\n&quot;We believe in sprouting the grains we use in our breads because <br/>\nsprouting is the only way to release all of the vital nutrients stored <br/>\nin whole grains.* To unlock this dormant food energy, maximize <br/>\nnutrition and flavor, we add just the right amount of water to healthy <br/>\nwhole organically grown grains which are already bursting with <br/>\nnutrients. Beneficial enzymes are activated which cause the grains to <br/>\nsprout and become a living food.<br/>\n&lt;company name&gt; breads, made from sprouted grains, are richer in <br/>\nprotein and vitamins than bread baked from dry grains ground into <br/>\nflour.<br/>\nOur exclusive sprouting process not only significantly increases <br/>\nvaluable nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin C, B-vitamins, calcium, <br/>\niron, magnesium and potassium but also causes a natural change that <br/>\nmakes the protein and carbohydrates easier for the body to use. In <br/>\nfact, sprouts are lower in carbohydrates and calories than the grains <br/>\nfrom which they were sprouted.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":236402377,"authorName":"the.bartels","from":"&quot;the.bartels&quot; &lt;the.bartels@...&gt;","profile":"lunamama3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: attention vegetarians","postDate":"1132089230","msgId":109895,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzN0E0RjhFLjEwNzA4MDJAZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRsZGhxaStrMW9uQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRsZGhxaStrMW9uQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":109894,"nextInTopic":109897,"prevInTime":109894,"nextInTime":109896,"topicId":109892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... it s ground up sprouted grains....still usually wheat and a combo of other grains, but somehow more nutritionally sound. :) -lisa","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-954486620\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&quot;Flour free&quot; ? - generally all -breads- have flour of some sort - <br/>\n&gt;needn&#39;t be wheat flour, - rice, spelt, other grains, whatever, lots of <br/>\n&gt;alternatives - it&#39;s still flour.
