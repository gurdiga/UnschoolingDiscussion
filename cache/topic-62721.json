Legally trophy hunted by a<br/>\nlocal guide (friend of mine) for a rich Texan, who was<br/>\ngonna kill her no matter what.  To put her stuffed<br/>\nhead on his wall. I didn&#39;t want to waste the meat and<br/>\nhide and dishonor the animal so I butchered her, stuck<br/>\nthe meat in the freezer and tanned the hide for a<br/>\nfriend who made a bed throw, and made the tail into a<br/>\nlovely collar and cuff set.<br/>\n  Another friend of mine had her dead cat stuffed and<br/>\nmounted and it is STILL her pet&lt;g&gt;, she collects<br/>\nvintage taxidermy and skulls, my kids LOVE to visit<br/>\nher house!  I know this response could be considered<br/>\n&#39;catty&#39; but it&#39;s an example of the wide eating (and<br/>\nthought) diversity even on this list.   You prolly do<br/>\nNOT want to know what is in MY freezer (besides<br/>\ncruelly slaughtered and hypothermic edamame)&lt;EVIL<br/>\nGRIN&gt;!<br/>\nKimontoya<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
