If she wants to read<br/>\nshe will when she&#39;s ready.  She doesn&#39;t need to read at 2 when there are so<br/>\nmany other things to be doing and she has you and Kevin to read to her.  If<br/>\nshe wants to, great, but why should it be a big deal? My older 2 (now 20 &<br/>\n18) were both late readers and then when Cody was younger I saw all these<br/>\nsigns of &quot;early readiness&quot; and I was so excited thinking he would be an<br/>\nearly reader - but no, he still has those &quot;readiness&quot; signs, but the reading<br/>\nhasn&#39;t clicked.  He&#39;s 7 1/2 and I guess he&#39;s going to be like the other 2<br/>\nand we still have a year or 2 before it does.  Aren&#39;t there a lot more fun<br/>\nthings you and Abigail can be doing that don&#39;t involve flash cards!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy niece was a very early reader - but she was not gonna&#39; use that potty!<br/>\nand she didn&#39;t have any hair so my sister has pictures of her at about 4<br/>\nreading to her twin bro and sis - so cute - &quot;3 babies&quot; sitting on a couch<br/>\nreading together!  Then she didn&#39;t do anything very different with the<br/>\ntwins, in fact probably did less since she was busier - and sure enough, Amy<br/>\nstarts reading even sooner than her sister but Tom still wasn&#39;t reading when<br/>\nhe stared school.  Same household, same opportunities, but he wasn&#39;t ready<br/>\nso he didn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how you gently relate to your mother and grandmother that their<br/>\ngreat acomplishments of &quot;teaching&quot; you and your sister to read were really<br/>\nYOUR OWN acomplishments!  Hmm - probably better leave that alone!<br/>\nBut do try to believe that you don&#39;t need to teach Abigail to read now.  If<br/>\nshe wants your help she will let you know, and there&#39;s plenty of time before<br/>\nreading independently becomes important to her - I&#39;m sure she would much<br/>\nrather snuggle up with you and a good book (or maybe 20 good books)<br/>\n<br/>\nRelax!
