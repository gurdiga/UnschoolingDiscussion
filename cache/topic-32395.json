My son, Julian, does TONS around the house, and certain jobs <br/>\nhave kind of become &quot;his.&quot;  For example, Julian does all the family&#39;s laundry <br/>\n(except for folding and putting away. He enjoys it, and doesn&#39;t mind the long <br/>\ntrip to the basement carrying heavy stuff. He is NOT reponsible for <br/>\nremembering to do it or staying on top of it -- if we notice we&#39;re piling up, <br/>\nor if we need a particualr garment, we&#39;ll ask if he minds doing a load. He <br/>\nnever does.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe now have three large people in this house (Julian is tallest, at twelve), <br/>\nand we all manage to keep the house this side of disaster. But no one is <br/>\npunished or responsible for the whole thing.  I do think about what happens <br/>\nwhen he leaves--the work load will increase significantly!<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32394,"nextTopicId":32368}}
