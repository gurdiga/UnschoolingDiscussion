(Am I an addict or what?)  Someone asked if when a<br/>\nbaby was born had anything to do with their sleeping schedules when they<br/>\ngot older.  I don&#39;t know that it holds true in all cases but here is my story.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was born in Toul France at about 11:00 in the morning if I recall<br/>\ncorrectly.  My folks were fine until they brought me back to the US 6<br/>\nmonths later.  Then it happened - I slept ALL day and kept them up ALL<br/>\nnight!  My Dad would even toss me in the air and I&#39;d sleep through it!  How<br/>\nfrustrating that must have been for them as he had a day job.  As I grew<br/>\nolder I stayed up later and later.  When I first got married my dh wanted<br/>\nto go to bed at 10:00 (still does!) and I looked at him in amazement (still<br/>\ndo!) saying &quot;But I&#39;m just waking up?!?!&quot;  Through the 19 years we&#39;ve been<br/>\nmarried I&#39;ve gone in spurts of staying up until 2, 3 or 4 a.m. and he still<br/>\nhates it.  But I&#39;d say that it could well be that there is some<br/>\nrelationship here with birth times and sleep times.  Hmmm, wonder if anyone<br/>\nis doing a study on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great day all!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn His Service,<br/>\n<br/>\nLaraine<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:praxis@...\">praxis@...</a> <br/>\nSubscribe to Our Prairie Primer Today Community at:<br/>\n             <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/PrairiePrimerToday\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/PrairiePrimerToday</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3223,"nextTopicId":3260}}
