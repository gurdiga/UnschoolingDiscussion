Rather than defending your statement, why not ask why<br/>\n*she* felt it might cause problems for people reading. (Well, you could do<br/>\nthat if she hadn&#39;t already explained it.) She saw something in your sentence<br/>\nthat you didn&#39;t. And that information could be valuable in figuring out how<br/>\nto help yourself better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about the concept of defense. When we defend something, we put up a<br/>\nbarrier around it to protect it from harm.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you&#39;re putting up barriers and protecting things that people feel might<br/>\nbe hindering you. The things people are trying to point out to you are<br/>\nthings that it would help you to examine in order for you to figure out how<br/>\nto help you and your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe try seeing yourself as separate from the choices you made. Think of<br/>\nyour choices as a hammer that you picked up. People with nicely screwed in<br/>\nscrews are trying to suggest that a screwdriver might be more useful for<br/>\nscrewing in a screw. They aren&#39;t saying you&#39;re a bad person for picking up a<br/>\nhammer. But if you defend your choice of the hammer, you&#39;re not helping<br/>\nyourself and you&#39;re turning away the people who could offer some useful<br/>\ninsights.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe people are guessing wrong. That&#39;s going to happen because it&#39;s<br/>\nimpossible to communicate perfectly in any media. But they&#39;re guessing wrong<br/>\nfor legitimate reasons. And if you want people to give you advice that makes<br/>\nmore sense for your family, you&#39;ll have to figure out what it is you&#39;re<br/>\nsaying that&#39;s giving people a wrong impression. *Not* because *they* need<br/>\nyou to. But because *you* need you to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe people are guessing right and your defenses won&#39;t let you see<br/>\nthat. I&#39;ve met Pam&#39;s and Sandra&#39;s and Mary&#39;s and Anne&#39;s kids. They all seem<br/>\nlike perfectly ordinary kids even though they&#39;ve all described the special<br/>\nissues they&#39;ve dealt with and are dealing with. Their kids are where it<br/>\nseems like you&#39;d like your kids to be. They have something you don&#39;t. It&#39;s<br/>\nhard to know what it is. And it will be impossible for you to figure it out<br/>\nif you put up barriers to protect yourself when part of what you have isn&#39;t<br/>\nworking for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than seeing this list as a force trying to get you to change, see it<br/>\nas a resource to mine for help. Rather than resisting what isn&#39;t being<br/>\nforced, ask questions. Ask why do you think that?
