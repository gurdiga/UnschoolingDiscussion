Introvert<br/>\n&gt; has sort of a negative connotation in our culture (hates to be with other<br/>\n&gt; people etc.) and she points out that being introverted may mean more that<br/>\n&gt; being in large groups drains your energy (whereas it energizes <br/>\n&gt; extroverts).<br/>\n&gt; Really good book.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Amy<br/>\n&gt;   -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Kelli Traaseth [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kellitraas@...\">kellitraas@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, October 09, 2002 5:27 PM<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] I need LOTS of encooouragement<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I think there are alot of negative thoughts or assumptions about someone<br/>\n&gt; who doesn&#39;t want to participate in something.  I am just figuring out <br/>\n&gt; these<br/>\n&gt; things for myself. Also figuring out that I am an introvert.<br/>\n&gt;   I wanted to ask others earlier about this, but didn&#39;t get around to it,<br/>\n&gt; now Elissa, thank you, brought it up.<br/>\n&gt;   I always thought I was an extrovert because I like to talk, can you <br/>\n&gt; tell,<br/>\n&gt; ha.. But, when I was supposed to go to functions with lots of people, I<br/>\n&gt; would get all stressed out.  After I&#39;ve been somewhere with lots of <br/>\n&gt; people I<br/>\n&gt; just feel zapped.  Could sleep or read or just veg. for a long time.  My<br/>\n&gt; mother had me going and going and going each day and I would get so<br/>\n&gt; depressed, well, that wasn&#39;t for me.  Now, I see that in my son, he <br/>\n&gt; likes to<br/>\n&gt; have his time alone,  and I know some people label him as lazy, he only<br/>\n&gt; likes to read, or play his gamestation, or other thinking things.  But you<br/>\n&gt; know what?  What&#39;s wrong with that?<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m so glad I saw that he is just fine in what he wants to do,  so <br/>\n&gt; that I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t force him into things that he really doesn&#39;t like.  Maybe he&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt; able to get through life without trying out drugs or other harmful things.<br/>\n&gt; By the way, I did go off my meds and I&#39;m feeling great!  ( maybe noone<br/>\n&gt; remembers, that&#39;s OK too)<br/>\n&gt;   We can&#39;t all be cheerleaders or homecoming queens or presidents of <br/>\n&gt; student<br/>\n&gt; councils, I feel like that is so often what is expected.  Some of us just<br/>\n&gt; have to be readers or writers or artists.<br/>\n&gt;   Has anyone else come to these conclusions?<br/>\n&gt;   Kelli<br/>\n&gt;   Elissa Cleaveland wrote:<br/>\n&gt;   --- Myranda &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:myrandab@...\">myrandab@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Yes, lazy because he&#39;d rather miss a meal than have<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; to actually get up and walk to the table.<br/>\n&gt;   (Not hungry)<br/>\n&gt;   He&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; rather sit and do nothing than open the closet to<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; get to the lego&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt;   (Thinking, daydreaming planning life is more important<br/>\n&gt;   than Lego&#39;s)<br/>\n&gt;   He&#39;d rather sit and watch other<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; kids play outside than put his slip-on sandles on so<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; he can go out.<br/>\n&gt;   (The Introvert enjoying watching the extroverts play)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;He&#39;s our little lazybones, said with<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; all fondness.<br/>\n&gt;   An insult said with fondness is still an insult.<br/>\n&gt;   Words make all the difference in teh world.<br/>\n&gt;   Elissa Jill<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;   Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;   Faith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & More<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faith.yahoo.com\">http://faith.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Yahoo!
