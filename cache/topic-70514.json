Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve always been a <br/>\nreader, and once immersed in a book, it takes a lot to bring me to <br/>\nthe surface, or if not reading a book, doing something online, but my <br/>\nkids have been making breakfast for themselves for quite some time. <br/>\nSimply because they&#39;d get hungry and go in the kitchen and start, and <br/>\nme not notice. Mind you, if they came to me and said they were <br/>\nhungry, I&#39;d definitely put the book down, but...heh heh...with my <br/>\nkids, it was &quot;Hungry, let&#39;s get some food&quot; and I&#39;d be in la-la land <br/>\nand they&#39;d be making food in the other room! L Probably starting when <br/>\nKatie was about 4ish, they&#39;ve done a lot of kitchen stuff their own <br/>\nselves. Sometimes it means a bit of a mess, and then we clean up <br/>\ntogether. But mostly it means that, now that they are 8 and 10, they <br/>\ncan make their own Ramen noodles, peanut butter toast, scrambled <br/>\neggs, sandwiches, etc. They can peel veggies, and cut things like <br/>\npotatoes. Not up to carrot sticks yet. They can bake a potato in the <br/>\nmicrowave, and heat up a can of chili. Grate cheese, though they <br/>\nusually ask for help with that. etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nA bit different from my 8 year old state, who couldn&#39;t have peeled a <br/>\ncarrot to save her life:Mom handled it all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And I have another totally off topic question, about the etiquette <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of this <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; conversation by e-mail thing <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is it somehow proper etiquette to respond <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; back to everyone who responds to me?

It&#39;s not fair to the dog and he&#39;s a living thing as <br/>\nwell as they are. I wouldn&#39;t shame them or punish. I&#39;d just get in <br/>\nbetween them and the dog and explain why it&#39;s not okay to hurt or <br/>\ndistress another living being if we can help it. At your kids&#39; ages I <br/>\nwould redirect or distract  them and then get the dog to a safe <br/>\nplace. Remember, they don&#39;t want to hurt the dog.

Anyway, it <br/>\nexcites and thrills me, and my husband, and I immediately let my children began to <br/>\nlead their own learning processes.

So perhaps this question isn&#39;t <br/>\nnecessary, but how do you all deal with these things? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, my son especially is so full of wonderful questions, and I love <br/>\nto go through things with him and answer questions, but how far do I take <br/>\nanswering each question, as he can&#39;t read yet and usually the process of getting <br/>\nthe answers that he wants bores his sister, and he&#39;d ask questions all day if <br/>\nI&#39;d answer them all.
