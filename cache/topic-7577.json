Ellickson and Kimberly A. McGuigan, from the RAND Institute in \n      Santa Monica, California. \n      <p>The researchers collected data from more than 4,300 students in \n      California and Oregon schools. The participants, drawn from a broad range \n      of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds, completed questionnaires \n      during 7th grade and again during 12th grade. The questionnaires were \n      analyzed to see what factors predicted violent behavior 5 years later. \n      <p>Students who engaged in behaviors such as stealing, cheating in school, \n      and skipping classes were more likely to behave violently in 12th grade. \n      So, too, students doing poorly in school or who had poor self-esteem. \n      Attending several different elementary schools, and attending middle \n      schools where drug use was more common were both predictive of later \n      violence. \n      <p>\n      <table align=\"left\" bgColor=\"#9999cc\" border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" cellSpacing=\"0\"\n>\n        <tbody>\n        <tr vAlign=\"top\">\n          <td>\n            <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"2\" cellSpacing=\"1\" width=\"170\">\n              <tbody>\n              <tr vAlign=\"top\">\n                <td align=\"middle\" bgColor=\"#ffffcc\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\"\n height=\"14\" src=\"https://ec.yimg.com/ec?url=http%3A%2F%2Fus.yimg.com%2Fi%2Fmesg%2Fconv_ic.gif&t=1571751167&sig=qNWL8IqVyrD.C0ICsJeRjw--~E\"\n width=\"15\">&nbsp;<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><b>Speak your \n                  mind</b></font></td></tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td align=\"middle\" bgColor=\"#ffffff\" vAlign=\"top\" width=\"170\"><font\n face=\"Arial,Helvetica\" size=\"2\">Discuss this story with other \n                  people.<br>[<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cnv.msg.yahoo.com/dir/Conversations/News/Health/chb?url=http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20000330/hl/chb%5f39.html&amp;title=School+behavior+and+environment+predicts+later+violence&amp;ct=954463474&amp;c=23013380223461577862564362062&amp;a=1\">Start \n                  a Conversation</a>]</font><br><font face=\"Arial,Helvetica\"\n size=\"1\"><b>(Requires <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cnv.msg.yahoo.com/conv_needs.html\">Yahoo! \n                  Messenger</a>)</b></font> \n      </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table>Overall, boys were \n      more likely to behave violently than girls, but the authors report some \n      interesting gender differences. Poor grades predicted relational violence \n      (directed at family or friends) for girls, but it predicted ``predatory&#39;&#39; \n      violence for boys -- such as gang fights, use of weapons, and violence \n      used to ``get something.&#39;&#39; \n      <p>Low self-esteem and living in poorer neighborhoods predicted violence \n      only for girls, while moving frequently during childhood and being offered \n      drugs in school were predictive only for boys. \n      <p>Unexpectedly, the investigators found that for boys, living in a \n      nuclear family increased the likelihood of later violence, and middle \n      school rebelliousness decreased it. \n      <p>``Because early deviance and poor grades provide useful warning signals \n      of later violence, these results suggest that violence prevention programs \n      aimed at younger adolescents should include efforts to prevent or reduce \n      troublesome behavior in school and poor academic performance,&#39;&#39; Ellickson \n      and McGuigan conclude. They add, ``Such efforts should begin in elementary \n      school.&#39;&#39; \n      <p>The researchers also noted that their findings suggest that &#39;&#39;programs \n      aimed at preventing drug use may yield an added violence-reduction \n      bonus.&#39;&#39; They called for further research to determine if this is actually \n      the case.
