We used to attend a playgroup once a<br/>\nweek, but that was too much for all of us for various reasons, so now we<br/>\nare just at home.  My kids are 3 and almost 2, and really enjoy the time at<br/>\nhome.  They both nap for two hours in the afternoon most days, and we spend<br/>\nour days playing together (or them playing on their own, which I think is<br/>\nimportant too.)  Since outings are hard with two little ones who sometimes<br/>\nneed to be carried and still think it&#39;s funny to run away from me, we go<br/>\nout when Daddy is home in the evenings, as a family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTrips to the grocery store mean two carts for two kiddies with two adults<br/>\npushing them.  If only one adult is going out somewhere, than the boys take<br/>\nturns getting to go with us (shopping, running errands, etc.)  In the cold<br/>\nweather we are indoors now, but when it is warmer we also go to the park on<br/>\nthe corner or to the river a few blocks away to feed the birds.  We enjoy<br/>\nhaving friends over on an individual basis once in a while, or going to<br/>\ntheir houses.  I think that it is very important for them at this age to<br/>\nlearn how to entertain themselves, how to get along with family, how to<br/>\nhave quiet time, and all the other life skills they are working on like<br/>\ntable manners, and being polite and kind to others, etc.  We don&#39;t have any<br/>\ninterest right now in potty training aside from talking about it, and I am<br/>\nnot pushing them.  They know where their potty is and can go whenever they<br/>\nlike and occasionally want to sit on it, but have not actually used it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as enrichment opportunites, my three year old can recognize his and<br/>\nhis brother&#39;s name in print; is learning his colors (knows blue, red and<br/>\ngreen,) knows the names of and how to play with various musical<br/>\ninstruments; knows some shapes; knows some letters; can do puzzles by<br/>\nhimself; knows how to do laundry; knows how to wash his hands and brush his<br/>\nteeth; knows many songs (Like Itsy Bitsy Spider) and many stories by heart;<br/>\ncan recognize and name all types of construction equipment, animals, and<br/>\nvehicles; says bless you, thank you, you&#39;re welcome, I&#39;m sorry and please<br/>\nautomatically, to name a few of his skills.  All of this is without ever<br/>\nattending any sort of classes, and never &quot;working&quot; with him on any of these<br/>\nskills.  We simply show by example, answer his questions, read to him, and<br/>\nplay together.  Lately he has been asking the color of everything and is<br/>\nbeginning to tell me what color something is (and get it right.)  His<br/>\nsocial skills are pretty advanced for a child his age, and I have even had<br/>\nstrangers comment on how friendly and articulate he is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy &quot;baby&quot; is a much quieter type of person and does not talk nearly as<br/>\nmuch, but he is learning many things by copying his brother, whom he<br/>\nobviously idolizes.  They play really well together and are very<br/>\naffectionate with each other.  As they get older I will take my cues from<br/>\nthem about how much and what types of social activities they would like to<br/>\nget involved in, but I still will reserve the right to veto something or<br/>\nmake them choose if it is too much, for them or for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Crjjss@aol.com","from":"Crjjss@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"bR_cCJ7idgdglHak0HyQcctXUqtH1qGOhMYUlk26v-TJWhiwaIKH9aWl4vImuJD1vccn1wU","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Socialization issue?","postDate":"948166622","msgId":5648,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNzMuNTY0OC45NTkyNjk3NDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5631,"nextInTopic":5667,"prevInTime":5647,"nextInTime":5649,"topicId":5587,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/16/2000 3:16:57 PM Pacific Standard Time, megates@juno.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-430788955\">In a message dated 1/16/2000 3:16:57 PM Pacific Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:megates@...\">megates@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; (Maybe the fact that we are not enrolled in constant classes is a factor<br/>\n - we are home a lot.)<br/>\n Mary Ellen &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen,<br/>\n        I enjoyed reading your post on this subject because it sounds like <br/>\nyou are the antithesis of what I have let happen in my family.

I was too until I read<br/>\neverything I could get my hands on.  Suddenly I realized that socialization is<br/>\nall interaction with anyone.  My kids go everywhere with me, and they get to<br/>\nsee and interact with everyone I do, so I think they will be just fine.  It<br/>\nhelps to think of socialization as living.  My husband just needed some<br/>\ntime...   Is your husband willing to give some time?  He will see after a bit<br/>\nthat your kids are just fine (really even better socially than school kids)<br/>\nAnother thing that helped my hubby was to meet a couple of homeschooled teens<br/>\nand older.

The reality is that these oh so important friendships<br/>\nthat are going to last a life time, don&#39;t!  Studies, which ps of course<br/>\nnever uses or it would ruin their argument, show that rarely do<br/>\nrelationships stay static and most folks move on.  Several hundred people<br/>\nwere interviewed in each study and it was found that unless someone was<br/>\nborn, raised and lived their whole life in the same town and the same<br/>\napplied to their &quot;best friend,&quot; most people couldn&#39;t even name their &quot;best<br/>\nfriend&quot; from grades K-3.  Although some folks could name &quot;a&quot; friend or two<br/>\nfrom 4-6, most couldn&#39;t.  The friends folks had in 7-9 rarely translated to<br/>\nlasting friendships through high school.  AND, most folks had lost contact<br/>\nwith anyone they went to high school with within 2 to 3 years after leaving<br/>\nschool unless, again, they lived in the same town for life and had business<br/>\ndealings with these folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has also been found that it isn&#39;t the &quot;quantity&quot; of folks one knows but<br/>\nthe &quot;quality&quot; of the friendships and the variety of folks one knows. <br/>\nSooooo, since most hsing kids meet a wide variety of people, interact with<br/>\na wide variety of people and have at least one good little friend when they<br/>\nare kids, they more than meet the criteria for needed socialization!<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n-----------<br/>\n I am pretty much sold on hs/unschooling.
