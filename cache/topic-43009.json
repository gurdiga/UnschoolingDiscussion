It will probably help you see the dynamics involved<br/>\nmore clearly and how the role you&#39;re playing has a different effect than<br/>\nsense would suggest it should.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has lots of practical ideas to try out too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sandra - first I never said - &quot;It&#39;s not my problem&quot;.   I do not use the &quot;It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not my problem&quot; response - quite the contrary - I say we must &quot;use our words<br/>\n&gt; to work it out&quot;  i.e., not react physically to one another - or be assaultive<br/>\n&gt; verbally.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s helpful when reading replies to recognize that people can&#39;t know what<br/>\nwe mean or what we do, and can only go by what words we use. Replies often<br/>\ntend to go beyond specifics of someone&#39;s particular situation to a bigger<br/>\npicture discussion of that type of problem. Sometimes from that some people<br/>\ncan say &quot;Oh, I hadn&#39;t seen it like that before!&quot; Or they can say &quot;Nope,<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t apply to us.&quot; (But it might apply to someone else who is reading<br/>\nalong in a similar situation.) Or &quot;Let me explain that a little better.&quot; ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I can not solve every personal difference they have in life - instead I choose<br/>\n&gt; to equip them with the skills (and guidance until the skills are developed) to<br/>\n&gt; handle those challenges without losing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I suspect you *think* you&#39;re offering them the skills for the times they<br/>\nsquabble -- and undoubtedly *are* doing what seems to make sense -- but it&#39;s<br/>\nnot getting translated into something that they find meets the needs they<br/>\nhave in that situation. So they keep falling back on something (squabbling)<br/>\nthat offers some sort of satisfaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, I know you&#39;re saying &quot;Yes, I know it&#39;s not working. I&#39;m asking what<br/>\nI should do!&quot; But often when we&#39;re certain we are doing it the right way but<br/>\nit isn&#39;t working, it&#39;s because we aren&#39;t seeing things from the child&#39;s<br/>\npoint of view, only from our own. Which is why I often recommend the How to<br/>\nTalk book.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And I can&#39;t offer anything from personal experience since I only have one<br/>\nchild!)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":689589,"authorName":"KT","from":"KT &lt;Tuck@...&gt;","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Intro - long","postDate":"1031289705","msgId":43035,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNENzgzQjY5LjEwMjA3MDdAbWlkc291dGgucnIuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE1ZC4xMzdlMmVkNy4yYWE1N2VjYkBhb2wuY29tPiA8MDFkYjAxYzI1NTM5JDA1YmFjYmUwJDY4NTIwNzQ0QHN5c3RlbT4="},"prevInTopic":43029,"nextInTopic":43044,"prevInTime":43034,"nextInTime":43036,"topicId":43009,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I pulled my son from a private school last February and the youngest of my trio from ps special ed in May.  Without all the gory details - our&#39;s is a story full of frustration and the crushing of a child&#39;s fragile spirit and a mother&#39;s search for answers when her heart was full of doubt....  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt has taken alot of time to de-school my son and to re-ignite his interest in exploring life and all it has to offer.  He still struggles at times - feeling &quot;too dumb to know anything&quot; (his words) - but those occasions are getting to be a rarity, thankfully.  He has survived mom&#39;s &quot;experimenting&quot; with h/s methodologies - from school-at-home and rigid structure to no structure (and everything in-between).  Though today at my dental appt - it was clear he has developed a new confidence in interacting w/ adults - he fired off questions for the dentist faster than he could answer them - everything from business management (go figure) to various tools and their functions.  As we were leaving the dentist asked him if he wants to be a dentist when he grows up - he told him &quot;Not a chance - I just want to know how your business works!&quot;  Sounds like a budding entrepreneur is in the house.<br/>\n  <br/>\nMy girls having gone through 2.5 yrs of early intervention due to global developmental delays from being preemies and 1 daughter (the &quot;baby&quot; of the trio) has some medical issues including epilepsy - in which medications dulled her mental abilities to near zombie-hood before we connected and switched to full medical treatment & management through our neurological team in MO. (we live in CA).  So, the girls had very &quot;schoolish ideas&quot; of what homeschooling was to be....  I think they are finally over the hump with expecting me to whip out the white board and the worksheets everyday.  It was almost a &quot;visionary-type moment&quot; last week - All the neighborhood kids were preparing to head back to school and they wanted to know when homeschool would start!  Yikes!  I sat down with them at bedtime and explained that kids that go to school only get &quot;x&quot; number of hours in school of &quot;learning time&quot; and that the teacher dictates what and how and how much time they get to learn something - they do not get to play computer games all day (as Timon&#39;s Mazes is their latest passion on the pc) in fact, they might not even get to play on a computer at all! and even if they are really interested in something - the teacher will decide when they are &quot;done&quot; learning about it.  I explained that at home - they can play, veg-out, tv, video, pc, experiment or tinker, etc.  to &quot;learn&quot; from the moment they wake to the moment they fall asleep - and they can focus (or not) on anything they choose....no time limits - no switching &quot;subjects at X:30&quot; etc.  They have all decided free structure homeschool is ok now - and that they actually have more learning time than the &quot;school kids&quot;.  That was a hurdle I never expected to have to jump with them....but now that we&#39;re over it they are much free-er in their play and not consumed with &quot;doing school stuff&quot;.  Amazing the impact societal expectations has on even the youngest child if we allow it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI struggle with my dh asking - &quot;What are you doing in school with the kids?&quot;  etc and have enjoyed the threads on this topic - perhaps I&#39;ll try the quotes idea....  I also struggle with the &quot;no&quot; thing - though I think I&#39;m getting better.  We still have battles here btwn the kids - I can&#39;t remember which thread I read someone say that doesn&#39;t happen to them?  how do you accomplish that?  My kids love to play and explore together but, they still squabble - call names and even hit each other when tempers flare.  I try to stay out of it and encourage them to work out their differences &quot;verbally&quot; - especially since I don&#39;t always know who the instigator was.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying to create a more learning friendly environment - taking things off the high shelves and making stuff as accessible as one can with a puppy in the house.   We have several dolls and plastic animals ho have joined our &quot;medic squad&quot;  with varying injuries and missing parts!  LOL!  Fortunately, gauze and bandages are great fun and the toys are much more patient than the pets are with receiving treatment!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43024,"nextTopicId":42854}}
