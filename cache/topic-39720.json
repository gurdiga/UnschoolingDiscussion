If you&#39;re using an email program such as Outlook or <br/>\nEudora, you can even have posts from certain people deleted automatically <br/>\nbefore you even see them. On AOL, we can sort our email, delete all posts <br/>\nfrom any particular email, and then read the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do read a post that bothers you - delete it rather than responding to <br/>\nit. I&#39;ve noticed, over the years, that people who WANT to be verbally hostile <br/>\nwill just get more so when they are responded to  -- so the best thing you <br/>\ncan do is not to respond at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to remember that what sounds rude to you may sound refreshingly direct <br/>\nand clear to someone else. Focus on issues and ideas and not on what may or <br/>\nmay not be real or imagined personal insults. <br/>\n<br/>\n I just did a quick search on yahoogroups - got over 300 unique hits on <br/>\nunschooling and unschoolers. There are a lotta lists out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":22330745,"authorName":"DMM5692@aol.com","from":"DMM5692@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2186 ~?DELETE?","postDate":"1028461420","msgId":39720,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdhLjJhZDVlMzc2LjJhN2U2ZDZjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39744,"prevInTime":39719,"nextInTime":39721,"topicId":39720,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"how can you delete em til you read em??
