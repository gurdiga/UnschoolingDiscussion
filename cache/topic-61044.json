The game is really involved, as any <br/>\nsuch games are, but when they&#39;re watching, they&#39;re doing as much commentary <br/>\nand tying-in as the announcers are.  They&#39;re really funny to hear, and <br/>\nthere&#39;s not a moment they&#39;re not actively engaged with each other <br/>\nconversationally, and the humor and thought are really at a pretty high le<br/>\nvel.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly was disappointed that the Simpsons wasn&#39;t on last night because of news <br/>\nspecials, but she watched Third Rock from the Sun while stringing beads for <br/>\nsomething involving (I think)  her My Little Pony collection.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby didn&#39;t see any TV all day.  He went with Holly to a Harry Potter <br/>\ntournament, then two hours of karate, then had two friends over to help him <br/>\nreorganize his closet (three hour job) and then went with them to play video <br/>\ngames and spend the night elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf these visiting friends, one is between the ages of Kirby and Marty, and <br/>\nthe others are 20 and older.  Our house is a good place to be.  Both parents <br/>\nare home, there&#39;s food, there are tables and chairs galore, and my kids <br/>\nattract people goodhearted enough to help them clean their rooms.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNot many families have as busy and rich a life as ours does.  I spent <br/>\none-on-one time with all my kids yesterday--Kirby on the drive to karate, <br/>\nwith him giving me the update on his girlfriend, the schedule at work, me <br/>\nreminding him driver&#39;s ed starts at 8:45 Saturday morning and does he want a <br/>\nnew notebook or would some old one of mine be fine.

He&#39;ll be on time, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough all this, the TV is on when the kids want it on, and off when they <br/>\ndon&#39;t.  We have movies, DVDs, and last night when I went to the video store <br/>\nto return Dennis the Menace and My Big Fat Greek Wedding, I asked them all if <br/>\nthey wanted anything.  They said no.

In<br/>\nfact, in my opinion, the best possible set-up is not<br/>\nto eliminate the T.V. completely - still have a VCR<br/>\nand watch movies occasionally, but just eliminate the<br/>\ntelevision aspect. Think how much time you waste just<br/>\nwatching commercials for things you don&#39;t need! Life<br/>\nis meant for living, not watching other people live.<br/>\nOnce your T.V. is gone, I promise you will not miss it<br/>\nat all. Best of luck1<br/>\nBetony<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I have been lurking for about a<br/>\n  week. I have a 4 year old daughter and a baby due in<br/>\n  June. I wanted to talk about tv. My daughter seems to<br/>\n  be watching alot of it lately. I see myself being a<br/>\n  pretty radical unschooler, but when it comes to tv I<br/>\n  start getting insecure and wanting to control it. I do<br/>\n  suggest we do other things like play games, read<br/>\n  etc.... Now that the weather is getting nicer we can<br/>\n  be outside more. There is no doubt that she would<br/>\n  rather be doing something outside. Unless I am willing<br/>\n  to get rid of the tv, which I don&#39;t think is the<br/>\n  answer (I have a few shows I am not willing to stop<br/>\n  watching) . It doesn&#39;&#39;t seem to fit with our family to<br/>\n  control tv watching when we believe in unschooling in<br/>\n  every other aspect. I can&#39;t help but think if she<br/>\n  wasn&#39;t sitting in front of that tv she would be doing<br/>\n  something else. There is selfish aspect right now to<br/>\n  because I am 6 1/2 months pregnant and tired. Laying<br/>\n  on the couch sounds good alot of the time. I would<br/>\n  like to hear other families experiences with tv<br/>\n  watching and how other unschooling households do it. I<br/>\n  guess I want to know that my daughter isn&#39;t the only<br/>\n  one who watches alot of tv some days.<br/>\n                 Thanks Kimberly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  __________________________________________________<br/>\n  Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n  Yahoo!

I have been lurking for about a<br/>\nweek. I have a 4 year old daughter and a baby due in<br/>\nJune. I wanted to talk about tv. My daughter seems to<br/>\nbe watching alot of it lately. I see myself being a<br/>\npretty radical unschooler, but when it comes to tv I<br/>\nstart getting insecure and wanting to control it. I do<br/>\nsuggest we do other things like play games, read<br/>\netc.... Now that the weather is getting nicer we can<br/>\nbe outside more. There is no doubt that she would<br/>\nrather be doing something outside. Unless I am willing<br/>\nto get rid of the tv, which I don&#39;t think is the<br/>\nanswer (I have a few shows I am not willing to stop<br/>\nwatching) . It doesn&#39;&#39;t seem to fit with our family to<br/>\ncontrol tv watching when we believe in unschooling in<br/>\nevery other aspect. I can&#39;t help but think if she<br/>\nwasn&#39;t sitting in front of that tv she would be doing<br/>\nsomething else. There is selfish aspect right now to<br/>\nbecause I am 6 1/2 months pregnant and tired. Laying<br/>\non the couch sounds good alot of the time. I would<br/>\nlike to hear other families experiences with tv<br/>\nwatching and how other unschooling households do it. I<br/>\nguess I want to know that my daughter isn&#39;t the only<br/>\none who watches alot of tv some days.<br/>\n               Thanks Kimberly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

But watch what she watches and listen to what she says. You will be surprised how much one can learn from &quot;just watching tv.&quot; My kids learn all kinds of things about animals, history, geography, language, sports, and the list goes on. Things I know we haven&#39;t talked to them about and things I thought they wouldn&#39;t be interested in. Maybe they aren&#39;t really but the facts are there anyway. And all from cartoons. Which at their age right now is pretty much all they watch when they do, aside from the animal planet channel. Don&#39;t worry about.

Sometimes not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToday Holly has watched Simpsons (rerun), Friends (new), the boys and two <br/>\nother teens just watched two hours of wrestling, and Keith watched it in his <br/>\nown room (because the boys talk about the Raw Deal card game while they watch <br/>\nit, and Keith doesn&#39;t know or care about the game).

They&#39;re starting to turn.  She, Kirby and Marty went <br/>\nto a Harry Potter tournament for three hours (Kirby won), then Kirby was at <br/>\nkarate for two hours...<br/>\nTV was an option over that other stuff, and is an option now, but it&#39;s off.<br/>\n<br/>\nWait...<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, it&#39;s back on.  Kirby is sorting cards and turned on Married With <br/>\nChildren, which he totally  missed in its earlier incarnation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKirby&#39;s going to visit friends from his Anime club tonight and will probably <br/>\nspend the night, so he&#39;s not in on the upstairs game, turns out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEarly today, Holly watched the remainder of a Mary Tyler Moore DVD so we <br/>\ncould return it to Netflix.  It was good opportunity for conversation about <br/>\nthe women&#39;s movement, TV in the 1960s, and changing language.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":82448069,"authorName":"Kimberly Viducich","from":"Kimberly Viducich &lt;kvid@...&gt;","profile":"kvid","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: New Member TV  questions","postDate":"1047613769","msgId":61044,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMzE0MDM0OTI5Ljc2ODcwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MDAxLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":61046,"prevInTime":61043,"nextInTime":61045,"topicId":61044,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I m new on the list.
