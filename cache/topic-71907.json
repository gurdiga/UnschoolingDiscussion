The homeschoolers I know down here are very &quot;school&quot; minded.  A <br/>\nlot of the women think I made up the term &quot;unschool&quot; just to justify what we <br/>\n*don&#39;t* do.    I am a rebel to them.  My kids don&#39;t know geography well enough <br/>\nto hang in our group&#39;s geography B... but they are well enough adjusted to <br/>\nparticpate and get every answer wrong and not hate themselves for it  : )   They <br/>\nunderstand that they are not *failing* just because they don&#39;t yet know <br/>\nsomething.  And.. they take opportunities like that to learn from the correct answers <br/>\nthat they hear.
