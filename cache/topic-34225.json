After all that&#39;s what most of the statutes call it.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t use the same answer in all cases.  If another homeschooler  asks, <br/>\nit&#39;s unschooling.  If someone outside of homeschooling asks, it&#39;s <br/>\nhomeschooling.  It&#39;s a matter of perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an example I&#39;ve used before and it&#39;s easy for even kids to <br/>\nunderstand.  If someone asks in person, conversationally, &quot;Where do you <br/>\nlive?&quot; the answer depends on where THEY live.  If you&#39;re in a foreign country <br/>\nand they ask, all you need to give is the name of your country.  They  might <br/>\nor might not ask for more.  (So in England, Holly said &quot;the United States.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re across the country, you name your state/province.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re across the state, you name your town.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re across town, you name your neighborhood or cross-streets.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your neighborhood you say &quot;across from the park&quot; or &quot;behind Hollywood Vid<br/>\neo,&quot; or you give the street name or address.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re standing on your street and can see your house and they ask, you <br/>\npoint at it and say &quot;right there.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with this: <br/>\nthey don&#39;t go to public school <br/>\nhomeschool<br/>\nunschool<br/>\nradical unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34186,"nextTopicId":34209}}
