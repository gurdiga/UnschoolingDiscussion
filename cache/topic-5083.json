In the<br/>\nprocess, they reaffirmed the bonds of community---and had a whale of a<br/>\ngood time.  Working together toward vital common goals strengthened their<br/>\nrelationships as it lightened their labor.  There was no split in their<br/>\nlives between love and work, self-interest and mutual aid.  In our<br/>\ncomplex and technically advanced society, we no longer need each other&#39;s<br/>\ndirect and personal help to survive.  We&#39;re still dependent on other<br/>\npeople, but the cooperation that keeps us alive has become abstract and<br/>\nimpersonal.  We can buy houses built by strangers.  We can stand in line<br/>\nat the supermarket to buy our food.  We can open the Yellow Pages and<br/>\nhire a doctor or a plumber.  We exchange most goods and services for<br/>\nmoney instead of love.  We&#39;ve gained the freedom to pursue our individual<br/>\ngoals--and that&#39;s a precious freedom--but we&#39;ve paid a high price: the<br/>\ncommunity of purpose that once fused work and relationship into a<br/>\nmeaningful whole.  Our most practical and satisfying way of getting<br/>\nthings done is still together.  And the proof is that so much of our<br/>\npotential stays stubbornly locked inside us as long as we try to tap it<br/>\nalone.<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nSnowflakes are on of nature&#39;s most fragile things,<br/>\nbut just look at what they can do<br/>\nwhen they stick together.<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>\nTry Juno Web: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4978,"nextTopicId":5047}}
