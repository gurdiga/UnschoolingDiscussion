Marty and I have <br/>\nbeen having good little exchanges about what he perceives is going on, since I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t talk TO my kids about what my theory was so much as I just lived it.  <br/>\nHe heard things at the conference in August he hadn&#39;t heard before, and said <br/>\nhe thinks all unschooled kids should go to some conferences before they <br/>\nhomeschool their own kids (that&#39;s not exactly what he said, but I don&#39;t remember what <br/>\nhe said--it was something about not understanding so much of the reasoning <br/>\nbehind how we lived until he heard me explaining it to other people).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Marty said this:  &quot;I think it&#39;s about teaching your kids morals.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat wasn&#39;t the answer I expected, and I said &quot;You think it&#39;s about morality? <br/>\n Why?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said they need to learn right and wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked about people&#39;s plans and feelings and he agreed.  So what for me was <br/>\nseeming like courtesy, he upgraded to morality.<br/>\n<br/>\nYears back my kids used to ask to open a gift early and we&#39;d do that <br/>\nChristmas eve, but they disappointed themselves a few times and decided against it <br/>\npretty easily on their own, as a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with the idea that the gifts aren&#39;t given until the gift-opening <br/>\nmoment.  I also think they&#39;re part of the decor, not just at Christmas, but at <br/>\nweddings (when they&#39;re displayed in all their silvery paper) and birthdays (the <br/>\ncake is in one place, the gifts are in another place).<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that the traditional ceremony is primary, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanksgiving&#39;s a good day to give an example.  If there&#39;s a lot of food being <br/>\nmade, people COULD just eat all day, but then there&#39;s no culminating feast to <br/>\nsit down to.  It spoils the tradition.   I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reason to <br/>\nstarve kids way past their regular mealtime, either.  It&#39;s a day of naturally <br/>\noccuring celery sticks, at least! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes something is made just for the family.  A tray of brownies might be <br/>\nmade because someone wanted brownies.  But it&#39;s worth asking before getting <br/>\ninto them, because they might have been made a a gift or for a potluck.   My <br/>\nkids always ask about trays of food they see being prepared.

The children get <br/>\na little mini-celebration every day starting December 1. (This year our <br/>\n8-year-old is actually counting the days to December First on the kitchen calendar, <br/>\nrather than to Christmas Day! Really!)<br/>\n<br/>\n       We&#39;ve always had a Nutcracker Calendar, a stand-up board with tiny <br/>\nillustrated  books each telling a few lines of the ballet story. Dad puts on his <br/>\nvelvet Santa hat and we all sit together as the children produce the book of <br/>\nthe evening for reading aloud. Then the youngest child present at the reading <br/>\ngets to choose a spot on the tree to hang the book (there&#39;s a little gold cord <br/>\non each one.) The story builds and the tree fills up until Christmas Eve, when <br/>\nthe tall SugarPlum Fairy book is read by firelight. During the day, children <br/>\noften remove the books from the tree to play with, read and replace (we also <br/>\nput all their real Christmas books away with the decorations each year, and set <br/>\nthem out under the tree as colorful &quot;atmosphere.&quot; They get enjoyed a LOT this <br/>\nway!)<br/>\nAnd the spot under the tree doesn&#39;t seem bereft even the very first day we <br/>\nput it up.<br/>\n<br/>\n       This year, I guess tradition will be flexing a bit. Our son found his <br/>\nown Advent calendar at a bookstore. That&#39;s why he&#39;s counting down the days. <br/>\nIt&#39;s a big Lego box with 24 little compartments, and inside each one (it seems - <br/>\nwe haven&#39;t reached Dec 1 yet to see) are a few Lego parts that can be built <br/>\ninto a tiny Lego Santa or sled or evergreen or other Christmas character or <br/>\nobject. I think as the month goes on, they can be played with and recombined <br/>\n(that&#39;s how I would have designed it &lt;g&gt;) but don&#39;t know for sure. Will let you <br/>\nknow next week.<br/>\n<br/>\n       So the plan here is to use both calendars this year. DS has asked for <br/>\nhis at breakfast and the Nutcracker reading each evening, to give him <br/>\nsomething to look foward to at both ends of every day. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n       Or, I wonder if anyone has ever tried Advent cookies? Bake a different <br/>\nkind every day, with the children helping all along and then setting out the <br/>\nplate each afternoon to be eaten before the next day? You could put peppermint <br/>\nchips in sugar cookies the first day, then use green food coloring, etc and <br/>\nlead up to shape cookies and sprinkles as the Big Day nears.
