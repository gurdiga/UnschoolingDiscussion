It&#39;s on the home page of the yahoo groups page <br/>\nfor this list:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nÂ Description    Category: Home Schooling <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what they <br/>\nneed from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent is a <br/>\nfacilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with curiosity and <br/>\nenthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and <br/>\nhow of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob <br/>\nSquarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to find out more <br/>\nabout how video games and life in general are filled with learning, come join <br/>\nus!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling is <br/>\n*not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed <br/>\nlearning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest in <br/>\nunschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in <br/>\nmind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways <br/>\ndesigned to help each other become unschoolers or become better at <br/>\nunschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a <br/>\n&quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively <br/>\ndebate and questioning beliefs to their foundations. If you have questions <br/>\nabout this list please feel free to contact list moderator Joyce Fetteroll (<br/>\nfetteroll@...)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list and the Unschooling.com site were created and are still supported <br/>\nby Home Education Magazine: (http://www.home-ed-magazine.com); Helen Hegener (<br/>\nHEM-Editor@...) is the list owner</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43091,"nextTopicId":43236}}
