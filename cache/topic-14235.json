Both sales were on because it was the Thursday<br/>\nafter<br/>\n&gt; Thanksgiving.  Had I needed or wanted to go to one of the malls in which<br/>\nI&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; been shopping since I was a teenager (and that was the 1960&#39;s/70&#39;s) I<br/>\nwould<br/>\n&gt; have been pretty miffed if I&#39;d had to face people yelling at me about<br/>\n&gt; ANYTHING.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Christmas gift-giving is one of my best things.  My siblings and cousins<br/>\nused<br/>\n&gt; to call me &quot;Sandra Claus&quot; even when we were kids because I could do<br/>\nsomething<br/>\n&gt; cool without a bunch of money.  It&#39;s one of my few creative talents.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; fallen down some with being older and having other things to think about,<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; shopping sales is a very good thing to do.  It would be &quot;better&quot; (not good<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; all) to protest those who wait until December 23 or 24, but some of them<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; so because they have no days off earlier, or no money earlier.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yesterday I split little matching (matching length) cedar sticks to dip in<br/>\n&gt; wax to bundle to give to friends as fire-starters.  I&#39;ll pack them in<br/>\nlittle<br/>\n&gt; baskets (thrift store, garage sale, things gifts were given to me<br/>\nin--they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; all out in the garage, and I&#39;ll just dig through for some good sizes) and<br/>\n&gt; stick a bow on them and maybe put a little bag of cookies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I did go shopping Thursday, and I&#39;m not evil nor stupidly mesmerized<br/>\nby<br/>\n&gt; advertising.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       eGroups Sponsor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14228,"nextTopicId":14243}}
