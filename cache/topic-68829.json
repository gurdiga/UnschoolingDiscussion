My three-year-old son had a lot of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; problems with potty training and I was on him constantly. One day we <br/>\n&gt; &gt; stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch in between errands. It was very <br/>\n&gt; &gt; busy, with a full dining room. While enjoying my taco, I smelled <br/>\n </span></blockquote>something <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; funny, so of course I checked my seven-month-old daughter, and she was <br/>\n&gt; &gt; clean. Then I realized that Danny had not asked to go potty in a while, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>so <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I asked him if he needed to go, and he said &quot;No.&quot; I kept thinking, &quot;Oh <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lord, that child has had an accident, and I don&#39;t have any clothes with <br/>\n&gt; &gt; me.&quot; Then I said, &quot;Danny, are you SURE you didn&#39;t have an accident?&quot; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;No,&quot; <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; he replied. I just KNEW that he must have had an accident, because the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; smell was getting worse. Soooooo! I asked one more time, &quot;Danny, did you <br/>\n&gt; &gt; have an accident?&quot; This time he jumped up, yanked down his pants, bent <br/>\n&gt;over <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and spread his cheeks and yelled. &quot;SEE MOM, IT&#39;S JUST FARTS!!&quot; While 30 <br/>\n&gt; &gt; people nearly choked to death on their tacos laughing! He calmly pulled <br/>\n </span></blockquote>up <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; his pants and sat down. An old couple made me feel better by thanking me <br/>\n&gt; &gt; for The best laugh they&#39;d ever had! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68827,"nextTopicId":68810}}
