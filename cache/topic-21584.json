Afterall, I wouldn&#39;t want to grasp<br/>\n&gt; something and ponder it&#39;s beauty without making sure it is authentic.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Hey, who knows since half the places that are suppose to be a certain<br/>\nplace aren&#39;t and half the movies have &quot;reality&quot; created by computer<br/>\ngraphics.  Might not be authentic.  I wasn&#39;t on the set of that particular<br/>\nmovie but the ones I was on were rarely what they purported to be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was inspired by the *ideas* of the earth beneath one&#39;s feet, by a movie<br/>\n&gt; that would<br/>\n&gt; show illegal and distasteful things and yet put them in context to a time<br/>\n&gt; and a struggle.<br/>\n&gt; My daughter and I have talked about many things that were in the movie<br/>\n&gt; before, finding<br/>\n&gt; a place for yourself, kids being competent enough to do many things adults<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t allow<br/>\n&gt; them to try, etc. Along with the other movie that she watched,<br/>\n&gt; where the idea of a girl building a shelter with whale bone was introduced<br/>\n&gt; to her, she was<br/>\n&gt; inspired to see children DOing things, and having necessity to do them.<br/>\n<br/>\n***That great, I&#39;m happy for your daughter.  And hopefully her mother would<br/>\nshare with her that this was not a true story.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Surely you don&#39;t mean to suggest that the ideas in the movie are white<br/>\n&gt; supremacist ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n***Surely you aren&#39;t saying that his ideas weren&#39;t his own, that he didn&#39;t<br/>\nwrite the book or he wasn&#39;t a white supremacist?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I happen to have Cherokee heritage, along with Shawnee.<br/>\n&gt; While my mother could live on a reservation and has done research, I have<br/>\n&gt; never cared to.<br/>\n&gt; Her natural bent is towards studying geneology and history whereas I tend<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; be more into concepts,<br/>\n&gt; and philosophies, and ideas. After watching the movie I thought, &quot;I should<br/>\n&gt; ask for her<br/>\n&gt; research and books.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***And if, as you say, your mother &quot;could live on a reservation,&quot; then she<br/>\nwould be an enrolled tribal member of one of the tribes that has a<br/>\nreservation and would have received a copy of the letter the Cherokee Nation<br/>\nsent out about their thoughts on this movie, right?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sounds curiously like unschooling to me, rather than traditional schooling<br/>\n&gt; where I&#39;d be given someone&#39;s facts to follow no farther than they suggest.<br/>\n&gt; Not because of watching a movie and thinking the people themselves were<br/>\n&gt; real, but<br/>\n&gt; that the ideas were worth exploring.<br/>\n&gt; Which I still believe they are. They are some of the same ideas we&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; explored as Unschoolers,<br/>\n&gt; which aren&#39;t all that easy to find in movies.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Rather contradictory, don&#39;t you think.  First you don&#39;t want to be given<br/>\n&quot;someone&#39;s facts&quot; and then you don&#39;t want to research to find the truth.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll do that research you suggest, but you have fun trying<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; burst balloons with your little needle.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Gee, strange comment coming from a supposed unschooler since generally<br/>\nspeaking they don&#39;t accept what is dished up as fact and are more inclined<br/>\nto search out the truth.  But I guess from the snippy little comments, the<br/>\n&quot;little needle&quot; must have gotten close &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Stephanie Currier","from":"&quot;Stephanie Currier&quot; &lt;clownofgod@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"SMT5IlJ7mr6M9o1HYoJbsaRzwO-QKKYJVFeJUlaemWyoTdWCMl2td7U5rzsfR1-nKBcwK5x2p7Iwne7PyARiaEv8465Ln3ONrVxaDXfftdy51dc","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Herd Instinct","postDate":"990538832","msgId":21694,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2YwMWMwZTJjNCRjNzkyNWZhMCRhYmI4ZmZkMUBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDk5MDUyMjAyNi42NTAuOTQzNTcubDEwQHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":21670,"nextInTopic":21698,"prevInTime":21693,"nextInTime":21695,"topicId":21584,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... of lies.
