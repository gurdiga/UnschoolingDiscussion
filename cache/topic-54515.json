They were all getting sick and suspected <br/>\nsomething as they had roof problems also. They called their insurance <br/>\ncompany and they took care of it from there. The whole inside of the house <br/>\nhad to be gutted and redone. It was all covered but they were out of the <br/>\nhouse and in an apt. for a year. Definitely something to get taken care of <br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE* <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54500,"nextTopicId":54253}}
