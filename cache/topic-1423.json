I <br/>\nhave no clue as to what the conversation is about!  But I do know a bit about <br/>\npeeling paint.<br/>\nI resigned directorship of a non-profit last year that I founded in 1994 to <br/>\neradicate childhood lead poisoning.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeeling paint is a real big issue for me and I would lobby, and have lobbied, <br/>\nagainst anyone trying to say it is not.  Peeling paint, in homes older than <br/>\n1978 can contain lead in very toxic levels, and usually does.  when this <br/>\nbecomes accessable to a child or the dust created by it settles in areas that <br/>\nchildren frequent, disaster soon follows.  Peeling and chipping paint from <br/>\nhomes, due either to renovation or deterioration, that has settled, or been <br/>\nleft, on soil contaminates the entire perimeter of a home and children cannot <br/>\nplay safely there ... nore can you safely grow food crops there.  if you live <br/>\nin a community where your homes are close together, the risk is heightened <br/>\ngreatly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMillions of our children have been affected by lead and many of us go unaware <br/>\nof its toxicity and deterimental affects on growing children and developing <br/>\nfetuses.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the sad part is that peeling paint is a violation of city ordinances in <br/>\nmost areas, more so because of its toxicity to the homes inhabitants and less <br/>\nbecause of its bad appearance.  These ordinances left uneforced have damaged <br/>\nmillions of children.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1396,"nextTopicId":1411}}
