A paragraph in Gatto&#39;s book Underground <br/>\nHistory of American Education. He says (paraphrase) Sudbury Valley <br/>\nschool doesn&#39;t have any reading lessons. No one teaches reading, yet <br/>\nevery kid that attends there, leaves knowing how to read. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat, along with the frustration of watching two kids pick up reading <br/>\nwith less than one week of phonics, and the third kid NOT pick up <br/>\nreading with a half a YEAR of phonics. The first two were ready to <br/>\nread, and would have learned, phonics or not. The third is my &quot;late <br/>\nstarting reader&quot; who hasn&#39;t started reading yet. And this poor mother <br/>\nof a seven year old...My main advice to her was &quot;Relax&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>\nlet the experts get all worked up about him, or they could make him <br/>\neven more miserable&quot; (he&#39;s already feeling so bad, because he is in <br/>\np.s. and his classmates all read) <br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt my friend would relax so long as late teens, though! ack. LOL <br/>\nI might not be able to do THAT!
