When you talked about your <br/>\nfather, I could totally relate!  I did not get so much the proud, <br/>\nbut comments like &quot;You&#39;re the smart one, you take after me.&quot; or <br/>\ncomments related to looking attractive.  To this day I still have <br/>\nmajor issues with those things.  I make an effort to watch the way <br/>\nin which I compliment my son.  It is so natural to tell him how <br/>\nhandsome he is but I try instead to tell him I think he is smart or <br/>\nfunny or kind.  My Dad made me feel like if I was not attractive or <br/>\nhad gained weight than I was not lovable.  I would never want to <br/>\npass that on to my kids.  I had not analyzed the &quot;proud&quot; comments <br/>\nand I do say those quite a bit.

Never yell that out to them &lt;BG&gt; but we talk about<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is a situation I may know about ahead of time, like my kids being<br/>\naround someone they have had trouble with before, we talk before we get<br/>\nthere about what to do if such and such will happen. Talk about being<br/>\nrespectful and so on. I&#39;m always right there with them though anyway. When<br/>\nthey 2 middle kids off without me, that&#39;s only at sports camp. I have never<br/>\nhad a hard time with anything happening there. The coaches are extremely<br/>\naware of kids respecting each other and there are little reminders all day<br/>\nabout that and also encouraging one another too. So when I send them off at<br/>\nthe park, I always just say have fun. That&#39;s what I want them to do and I&#39;m<br/>\nvery comfortable in knowing they are well looked after.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Tara goes out, I always call out to her to *be careful*, then I love<br/>\nyou. We  have talked about what my *be careful* means, so she knows all that<br/>\nit entails. Mostly if she&#39;s driving, it means to be aware of what&#39;s going on<br/>\naround her. Don&#39;t be playing with the radio and gabbing on her phone while<br/>\ndriving. Watch if she&#39;s being followed home and watch if she&#39;s out alone<br/>\nwalking to her car. Don&#39;t stay or go where trouble is. Always call if she<br/>\nneeds help in any way. So my little *be careful* is loaded and it&#39;s just a<br/>\nreminder to her. I always tell her to have fun too. Sometimes I&#39;ll say to<br/>\nher, &quot;don&#39;t do anything I wouldn&#39;t do&quot; which she responds with, &quot;well that<br/>\njust gives me unlimited choices doesn&#39;t it?!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Being Proud","postDate":"1064172460","msgId":81156,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyYWIwMWMzODA3NyQxMWM2YTM0MCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGNiLjM3MzQzZDY4LjJjOWY0MzExQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":81154,"nextInTopic":81167,"prevInTime":81155,"nextInTime":81157,"topicId":81126,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Can&#39;t <br/>\nthink of a time I have.  My parents didn&#39;t either.  I do remember after my mother <br/>\ndied, it was a few years after, having family come up to me and say &quot;your <br/>\nmother would be so proud of you and how your life are turning out.&quot; (or something <br/>\nlike that) it made me feel very good to think that she would have approved of <br/>\nhow I am living my life.  Not that I need her approval but not having her <br/>\naround that gave me a warm feeling to think about.<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Being Proud","postDate":"1064159066","msgId":81128,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdCMjNCQzQxLUVDNEEtMTFENy1BQjBELTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0NC4xOTUwZDJmOC4yYzlmMThkOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":81126,"nextInTopic":81129,"prevInTime":81127,"nextInTime":81129,"topicId":81126,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m so proud of you, I think does convey an underlying attitude that might be something unschoolers, in particular, are trying to avoid.

My mother just said <br/>\nshe loved me and, also, especially when I was an adult, that she <br/>\nadmired different things about me or things I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my father said he was proud of me, it made me feel good. No doubt <br/>\nabout that. A whole lot like getting an &quot;A&quot; in school made me feel <br/>\ngood. BUT - the question is what else did it do. Were there further <br/>\nimpacts on my life that weren&#39;t so good, even though it made me feel <br/>\ngood? I&#39;d say yes. I made major schooling and career decisions in order <br/>\nto make sure my father would still be &quot;proud&quot; of me. MAJOR ones!!! <br/>\nInstead of examining my own individual interests and passions and my <br/>\nown desires for my future, I was extremely heavily influenced by what <br/>\nwould make my father proud of me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my mother said she admired me - she said she admired how hard I <br/>\nworked, how persistent I was, what a conscientious mom I was, and so <br/>\non, those kinds of comments made me feel proud of myself, true, but <br/>\nthey made me want to &quot;be myself&quot; even more than before.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think &quot;pride&quot; has an ownership sense to it, at least as most <br/>\npeople use it. It conveys a  feeling of &quot;I&#39;m basking in the reflected <br/>\nglory.&quot; And so a sort of underlying message got conveyed along with the <br/>\npride - and that was that my behavior was better if it reflected well <br/>\non him. My mom&#39;s &quot;I so admire that you breastfed your kids, even as <br/>\nthey got older,&quot; never felt like she was taking part of the ownership <br/>\nof what I did. It seemed like something she&#39;d say to anybody she <br/>\nadmired. She definitely gave ME full ownership of (and responsibility <br/>\nfor) my own behavior and didn&#39;t expect me to do something in order make <br/>\nher proud.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasing my behavior on trying to make other people proud of me - <br/>\nincluding doing well in school, especially - sent my life off in <br/>\ndirections that were not truly where I wish, now looking back, I&#39;d gone.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":158112576,"authorName":"TeresaBnNC@aol.com","from":"TeresaBnNC@...","profile":"tbb1967","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Being Proud","postDate":"1064156889","msgId":81126,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0NC4xOTUwZDJmOC4yYzlmMThkOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":81128,"prevInTime":81125,"nextInTime":81127,"topicId":81126,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"OK..
