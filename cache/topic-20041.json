Laurie was free to do as she chose at all times. My goal <br/>\nwas to let her instigate all of her learning. She had no rules except <br/>\nthat she could not hurt herself or anyone else. Everything else was <br/>\nopen to her. Most think this would lead to an irresponsible <br/>\nundisciplined child. I found just the opposite to be true. <br/>\nShe &#39;studied&#39; only what she wanted to study and therefore enjoyed the <br/>\nprocess of learning. She is like a sponge; she hears something and <br/>\nremembers it. We both attended college and had quite a few classes <br/>\ntogether. I would study for 3-4 hours to get an A or a B; she would <br/>\nglance at her notes thirty minutes before class and make A&#39;s, often <br/>\n100&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s difficult for some to realize that they can put total faith and <br/>\ntrust in their child learning what they need to know as they need to <br/>\nknow it. We don&#39;t have to &quot;teach&quot; them a single thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t named the book yet. We have ideas but nothing seems to <br/>\ncover it all. It&#39;s about unschooling, parenting, and living a <br/>\nlifestyle that would baffle many. I&#39;m trying not to degrade schools <br/>\ntoo much but instead raise unschooling to the pedestal it deserves to <br/>\nbe on. I will let you know when the book is for sale as soon as I <br/>\nknow myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease feel free to ask anything. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Valerie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., tonitoni@z... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am new to this group.
