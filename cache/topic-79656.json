I thought it was due to having watched a really scary movie called &quot;Child&#39;s Play&quot; when I was a child (it was an adult movie that I went to w/ my mother and her boyfriend).   But thinking about it now, if I had been allowed to go to her room when I was scared at night, the fear of someone shooting a noose at me from the door (this happened in the movie) would have probably disappeared.  Everything scared me at night, alone in bed.  Every scream of a cat or a human from the Boston allys, every growl of the radiator, the shadows on the ceiling and walls...  I am so glad that my children won&#39;t have to experience this terror.   Or if they ever do, we will be right there for them.  Some of our best conversations have happened in the dark in bed, or in a car in the dark, driving home.  The dark doesn&#39;t frighten them, which is amazing to me.<br/>\nMadeline<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\nIn a message dated 9/4/03 7:17:29 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Maybe it&#39;s more accurate to say that you haven&#39;t artificially imposed any<br/>\nfears on them since I don&#39;t think fears are entirely caused by parenting and<br/>\nenvironment.

We had a crib, but the kids generally ended up in bed <br/>\nwith us until they were older. <br/>\n**************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you are already using the family bed. Sadly, we kind of fell <br/>\ninto it, much like we fell into parenting. Moly was six weeks early and when <br/>\nshe came home she had to wear a belt of fiber optic lights to help her normalize <br/>\nher bilirubin levels (she had a severe case of jaundice) she had to wear it <br/>\nall the time, it was wrapped around her and fastened with Velcro. Then we had <br/>\nto cocoon wrap her with blankets. (She glowed neon blue! We called her our glow <br/>\nworm.) The doctors at the hospital kept telling me that I would probably have <br/>\nto stop nursing her and I refused, so I kept her wrapped up in those lights <br/>\n24-7. The thick cord that attached the belt to the machine which ran it was <br/>\nawkward and short. We had an antique cradle that I kept by our bed and she slept <br/>\nin with the lights and the warm, humming machine under it, for the first two <br/>\nweeks she was home. I kept her in her crib at all times except for when I <br/>\nnursed her or changed her, I was so afraid. I was barely 20 years old, my pregnancy <br/>\nhad been very difficult, Darin and I had been married barely 9 months when <br/>\nshe was born, the doctors scared me, telling me my milk was one of the things <br/>\nkeeping her levels high... All sorts of factors went into how I cared for her <br/>\nthose first few weeks. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the lights went back to the hospital she started waking up more at night <br/>\nand I couldn&#39;t figure out why. She had been a good sleeper right from the <br/>\nstart. Finally I realized that she had been lulled to sleep by the gentle hum of <br/>\nthe machine, the warmth and glow of the lights. So I began to keep her next to <br/>\nme at night. It was easier, she nursed at will and I got to sleep. So you <br/>\ncould say that my desperate need for sleep, combined with absolutely no idea how <br/>\nto care for an infant threw us into a family bed. Darin loved it! He loves how <br/>\nbabies smell, how warm they are, the soft, pretty noises they make. He would <br/>\nput her on a pillow lengthwise beside him. He was so afraid he would roll over <br/>\non her! He would wrap an arm around the pillow and make this little nest for <br/>\nher. I would just sigh gratefully and go to sleep until he nudged me awake to <br/>\nfeed her, and then she would be at my side the rest of the night. I gradually <br/>\ngot over my exhaustion and grew to love having her in bed with us too. She <br/>\nnever really left and when Jack came along we kept on with what was working. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey still at nine, almost ten, and seven, get into bed with us. Most nights <br/>\nthe kids put a movie on in our bedroom and fall asleep in our bed, then Darin <br/>\nand I snuggle with them for a while and put them into their own beds or we <br/>\ntake turns sleeping on the couch and let the kids stay in our bed with one of us. <br/>\nOn nights that they don&#39;t start out in our bed, for certain reasons &lt;g&gt; by <br/>\nthree or four in the morning, they are back in bed with us. I love having them <br/>\nthere, I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. I wish that things had been different <br/>\nwith Moly though. <br/>\n<br/>\nI envy those of you who read all the books, knew what you wanted, had your <br/>\nchildren later... Not that I regret ever having my kids, I just wish I had been <br/>\nolder, more mature, more prepared. I did choose to nurse, but only because my <br/>\nown mother nursed me and my siblings. It was a *my mom did it this way, so <br/>\nwill I* decision, not a well thought out, conscious decision. I didn&#39;t actively <br/>\ndecide to nurse my kids for longer than a year until Moly was almost a year old <br/>\nand I finally read a book on the subject. Up to that point I thought I would <br/>\nwean her when she was around a year old, end of subject. So many things in our <br/>\nlife have been done more out of impulse-right-for-this-moment-in-time than wel<br/>\nl thought out decisions, and that is the part I wish was different. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nHe felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered <br/>\nwhose it was and whether they were enjoying it.<br/>\nDouglas Adams <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: kids and sleeping, was Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] sticking with things","postDate":"1062606093","msgId":79813,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMDUwMWMzNzIzNyRkY2JhYzAyMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDdCMEI1NzI3LURFMDctMTFENy1BQzUxLTAwMzA2NUZCODJCOEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":79808,"nextInTopic":79821,"prevInTime":79812,"nextInTime":79814,"topicId":79656,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... explain a little?

We had a crib, but the kids generally ended up in bed<br/>\nwith us until they were older. When they were still nursing (each one<br/>\nmore than a year), they probably spent more of the night in bed with us<br/>\nthan in the crib.

Usually he starts in his own bed (watching tv<br/>\nwith, or talking to older sister) but ends up with us. I don&#39;t know that<br/>\nany of this was any big decision - simply what the kids wanted and what<br/>\nworked best for everyone.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe put the crib between the wall and the bed and took the side off.

When I was pregnant with the <br/>\nour first we were in Germany in a two bedroom housing area.  My parents were <br/>\ncoming to visit and staying through the delivery and for a couple of weeks <br/>\nafter.  So they were staying in what would have been the &quot;baby&#39;s room.&quot;  We bought <br/>\na small bassinet with the intention of getting a crib when they left.  Dallen <br/>\ncried when he was born and didn&#39;t stop for about 4 months.  At least it <br/>\nseemed like that.  The first night he cried so much that I didn&#39;t think I was going <br/>\nto get any sleep so I brought him to bed with us and he seemed to settle <br/>\nenough to nurse and sleep on and off and I slept.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that night I had a talk with Jackson to see what he thought.  And I <br/>\nread a couple of books, Family Bed and Continuum Concept.  Glad I chose those <br/>\nbooks.  We decided that it didn&#39;t feel right to let him cry.  I just couldn&#39;t do <br/>\nit.  I felt like he was calling me and I needed to be there.  So we abandoned <br/>\nthe idea of getting a crib and we gave the bassinet away.  That was the <br/>\nbeginning and we have been sleeping together from that day on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNever, when I was growing up, did I even know there was such a thing as a <br/>\nfamily bed.  But it seemed right and we all slept.  I was glad to have read those <br/>\nbooks though because it helped me feel like I wasn&#39;t a freak or something. <br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":65837075,"authorName":"Shannon","from":"&quot;Shannon&quot; &lt;davenshan@...&gt;","profile":"shan_who","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] sticking with things","postDate":"1062600898","msgId":79808,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEhFRUVKSFBHQ0tQRkdQTUVMTk9ETUVNSkRMQUEuZGF2ZW5zaGFuQG1pbmRzcHJpbmcuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAzOTQwMWMzNzFkNyQyOWE2YTQwMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":79804,"nextInTopic":79813,"prevInTime":79807,"nextInTime":79809,"topicId":79656,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

At first we used a crib, but it was way <br/>\nmore work and coldness than we wanted.  In short time, it was only used for <br/>\ndaytime naps, and not all of those.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got another bed, a double/fullsize, and I slept with Kirby there until he <br/>\nfell asleep, and visited Keith some nights, and sometimes stayed in there <br/>\nuntil I woke up to Kirby being awake right next door, and would switch beds.  It <br/>\nwas easier for me to switch beds than to get up and sit up in a chair and stay <br/>\nawake until Kirby was asleep and then risk a transfer.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverybody slept better when I was switching beds.   If we had had a bigger <br/>\nbedroom and my  husband didn&#39;t have a bad lower back, my preference would have <br/>\nbeen to have both those beds next to each other or mattresses on the floor <br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!  For a while we had a bassinet next to the bed, and would move the teensy <br/>\nkirby in there sometimes, or out of there sometimes, into the bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time Marty came, he and Kirby and I shared that kid-room bed lots, <br/>\nwith a net-and-tube side rail so nobody fell out, and I slept between them.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith has always gone to work early since kids were born, like 6:00, so it <br/>\nwas better for me not to be in there at that hour when he was leaving, and since <br/>\nkids were nursing it was better for him to sleep where he wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nawakened a bunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of my friends were doing an every-other-waking thing with their husbands <br/>\nwhere they told him he HAD to get up and get the baby every other time, or <br/>\nthat they would nurse the baby to sleep each time IF their husbands went and <br/>\nbrought him/her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThree couples I&#39;m thinking of did something along those lines, and the <br/>\nhusbands agreed, and the wives rested better than the husbands.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll three of those couples are divorced.  I still know them all (one dad I&#39;ve <br/>\nlost contact with) and all their kids, still, and their subsequent re-ups if <br/>\nany.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still with Keith, and now we sleep in the same bed every night and I can <br/>\nsleep through his going to work if I want to or am really tired, or can wake <br/>\nup and talk to him and then go back to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of those other couples have that option.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometime before Holly came or about that time, we got a bunkbed with a single <br/>\non the top and double on the bottom and Kirby moved up to the top.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was not ideal.  In retrospect, I wish we could have gone to bigger floor <br/>\nspace and been all together.  That old house had no room with floorspace <br/>\nenough for two mattresses.  Our new house has two rooms which would be big eough <br/>\nfor five people in one room.  But it&#39;s too late now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt last Kirby was in the same room with us, but he did feel shut out of the <br/>\nsleeping with mom opportunity and I&#39;m sorry about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of times one of the kids has slept with Keith, especially Holly.   And <br/>\nafter we moved to the bigger house, for the first couple of years I was worried <br/>\nif morning came and we hadn&#39;t picked up Marty or Holly in the night.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow they only show up if they&#39;re scared or have bad dreams.  Looking back at <br/>\nmy own childhood, I&#39;m really happy to see how few times they&#39;re scared.  I was <br/>\nscared a lot and my parents never once let me come in with them.

They had their own beds available which they could <br/>\nsleep in at any time, but they were rarely slept in.  Sometimes they <br/>\nstarted out the night sleeping with us to begin with.  Sometimes we <br/>\nwould lie down beside them in their beds until they went to sleep, <br/>\nthen get up and go to our own beds.  They would often sleep about <br/>\nhalf the night alone, then get up and come to our beds when they <br/>\nrealized they were alone.  They were always received with open arms.  <br/>\nSometimes they would sleep in the bed with us, sometimes in a <br/>\nsleeping bag on the floor.  Sometimes one of us adults would sleep in <br/>\nthe kids bed so both of them could sleep with the other parent in our <br/>\nbed.  Sometimes my husband would sleep on the couch, and the kids and <br/>\nI in our bed.  Sometimes we&#39;d make a pallet on the floor and <br/>\neverybody or some people would sleep there.  It was musical beds <br/>\nevery night.  Wherever and whenever anybody decided to sleep, they <br/>\ndid.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest son slept with us until he was almost 12.  Sometimes he&#39;d <br/>\nsleep part of the night alone, and part with us.  All of a sudden, <br/>\nright before puberty, he suddenly became very independent and needed <br/>\nhis &quot;space&quot; and privacy. Some kids may go to their own beds totally <br/>\nby 3 or 4 years of age, I don&#39;t think it matters when they go.  They <br/>\nwill develop their own independence in the course of discovering <br/>\nthemselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI loved our time in the family bed, and I feel strongly that the <br/>\ncloseness that we developed there is why my kids and I have such a <br/>\ngood relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":146409249,"authorName":"glad2bmadly","from":"glad2bmadly &lt;glad2bmadly@...&gt;","profile":"glad2bmadly","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: kids and sleeping, was Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] sticking with things","postDate":"1062593675","msgId":79793,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwOTAzMTI1NDM1LjMxNjUwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQyMDA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDdCMEI1NzI3LURFMDctMTFENy1BQzUxLTAwMzA2NUZCODJCOEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":79792,"nextInTopic":79794,"prevInTime":79792,"nextInTime":79794,"topicId":79656,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sounds like you are already following the basic principle which is allowing your babies and/or children if they still want to, to sleep with you.

Gillen and Jesse were both only in our bed until about 2 1/2.  We never got a crib.  Now they are happily in a bunk bed in their own room.  Sometimes the younger one calls in the night and one of us will go sleep with him (his bottom bunk is a double bed).  It works out great.  I highly recommend the double bed as a transition so they can stay in their room as they get bigger and yet still get visited by a parent and read to easily before sleep.  &#39;Course, they could always stay in your bed longer too.  This just worked better for all of us.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe best book I read about it is called, The Family Bed   It is only published in the U.K.   I don&#39;t remember the author (I lent it out) but it would be worth looking up at amazon u.k. if someone were new to this.<br/>\n <br/>\nMadeline<br/>\n<br/>\nsusan marie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seanachai3@...\">seanachai3@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nCould those of you who have a family bed, or don&#39;t/didn&#39;t use a crib <br/>\nexplain a little?

A couple of days <br/>\nago, I cut the last four boards that we have, and started on the <br/>\nhallways, getting it about 1/3 done.
