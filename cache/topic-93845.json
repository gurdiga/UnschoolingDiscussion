We three saw Mean Girls on opening day -- <br/>\nDD14 and me, with eight-year-old DS in tow. DS isn&#39;t in the least sexually <br/>\ncurious, got absolutely none of the innuendo and also wasn&#39;t bothered by any of <br/>\nit. He loved the movie, laughed his head off.  By the way, he knows as little <br/>\nabout school as he does about sex or girl psychology and head games. He still <br/>\nloved it -- didn&#39;t bother him in the slightest. :)  JJ<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. It&#39;s one of those movies that could have been gross and tedious, like so <br/>\nmany teen movies. You can&#39;t tell from the printed recipe how the chef&#39;s <br/>\npersonal flair and the outstanding quality of the  ingredients she hand-picked make <br/>\nthis movie worth seeing. Also her presentation on the plate --<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But the stuff I posted above...Wow, she doesn&#39;t know much about any <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; of that at all.  Maybe she&#39;s curious, maybe she&#39;s ready to start <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; hearing about some of that, and that&#39;s cool...but all that thrown <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; together in one movie? -=--<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The things you posted, not one of them is necessary to the plot.  If she <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t understand something, it will just go by and she won&#39;t need it <br/>\n&gt; explained <br/>\n&gt; to understand the story or the characters.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93808,"nextTopicId":93849}}
