There are 2 of them during<br/>\nthe year spring and summer.  It&#39;s called the Strawberry Music Festival<br/>\nis the web site is  www.strawberrymusic.com<br/>\nIt&#39;s so much fun!  Lots of things for kids to do and their parents.<br/>\nGreg Brown hasn&#39;t performed there since 1998, and I just went to the<br/>\nsite to see if the line up for next year was up yet and it&#39;s not, so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if he&#39;ll be back this year.<br/>\nThe funny this that Arlo Guthrie perfomed last year - almost made up for<br/>\nnot having Greg Brown there.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\nwho&#39;s only a little musical but is raising children with their father&#39;s<br/>\nmusical abilities</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49925,"nextTopicId":50066}}
