He WANTS and needs my help at <br/>\nthis point. I am actively involved in his practices doing just what <br/>\nyou said above (I am also musically gifted) and I attend every single <br/>\nlesson with him so that I know what the instructors expect him to <br/>\nwork on (and what we can leave aside). Unfortunately since these are <br/>\ngroup lessons (there are about 30 kids at each lesson with 3 <br/>\ninstructors that take turns teaching while the other 2 roam around <br/>\nthe class) we&#39;re running into the typical &quot;teach to the middle&quot; <br/>\nmentality that leaves out the slower/faster kids. They&#39;re doing a <br/>\ngood job of teaching the basics but sometimes I really squirm when <br/>\nthey do truly pointless exercises and talk to the kids like they&#39;re <br/>\nall slightly brain damaged. :/<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Finally, I tell my students&#39; parents that when their children ask <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to quit,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; they need to talk about what the problem is.

Our house has <br/>\nalways been full of music. I sing, play guitar, a little piano, and <br/>\nnow I&#39;m learning the viola right along with ds! My dh also plays <br/>\nguitar. Our son has always been musically inclined and he says he <br/>\nenjoys his viola lessons. However, he seems to have inherited his <br/>\nmom&#39;s perfectionist tendencies and becomes easily frustrated. Music <br/>\nlessons are not the only area in which we deal with this issue. It&#39;s <br/>\none of the reasons we unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve asked (and so far he&#39;s agreed) that he stick with these lessons <br/>\nuntil the end of the semester, at which time he can keep going, take <br/>\na break or outright quit. We keep reminding him of how thoroughly <br/>\nfrustrated he gets when he first plays a new video game. He <br/>\neventually figures out what needs to be done in order to succeed <br/>\n(while playing for hours on end; he actually learned to read by <br/>\nplaying them) and THEN he loves them. But until then he rants and <br/>\nraves and throws major FITS! I&#39;ve pointed out to him that sometimes <br/>\nlearning any new skill (like playing the viola) can be just as <br/>\nfrustrating AND just as rewarding as mastering his games. In fact if <br/>\nhe practiced the viola as often as he plays video games he&#39;d be a <br/>\nvirtuoso in no time! &lt;lol&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, I think I&#39;ll just lay off for awhile and let him know that <br/>\nit&#39;s up to him to come and get me when he wants to practice. Who <br/>\nknows, maybe if he goes to a lesson or two unprepared (he can&#39;t stand <br/>\nfeeling confused) he just might decide to practice after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth<br/>\nps(Now he wants to play the xylophone(!) so we&#39;re looking into that <br/>\ntoo.)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] encouraging a child to stick with it --LONG!","postDate":"1037292288","msgId":49748,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRiLjI2NjU2NDRhLjJiMDUyZDAwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49747,"nextInTopic":49756,"prevInTime":49747,"nextInTime":49749,"topicId":49735,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/14/02 5:50:30 AM, abtleo@earthlink.net writes:  with apologies for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1891980751\">In a message dated 11/14/02 5:50:30 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abtleo@...\">abtleo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Anyhow, this is a big issue to me, did you get that impression!? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nwith apologies for the length, &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked it.

I have friends who have been.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve known people who studied an instrument intensely for ten years, but as <br/>\nsoon as they left school they never touched it again.  Lots of people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a couple who were great at piano very early on, and both still play.  <br/>\nOne runs the music department at her church.

Some actually can, some need help getting going but can<br/>\ntake it from there, and many truly need someone there the whole time.<br/>\nRemember that when you practice, you&#39;re tackling something &quot;new&quot; at each<br/>\nmoment, because you&#39;re supposedly learning new patterns, solving problems,<br/>\nimproving sound or whatever.  It&#39;s not like legos, for example, where you<br/>\nhelped your child understand the directions the very first time they built<br/>\nsomething, and now they can take it from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to get parents to attend lessons, when possible, and practice<br/>\nregularly with their children, when possible, until the *child* asks that<br/>\nthey go it alone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my drill for parents: If you&#39;re encouraging your child to practice,<br/>\nagree on the time, or that right now is a good time.  Take out the<br/>\ninstrument together.  You could hold the viola while he tightens the bow.<br/>\nHelp him set up the music, put on the shoulder rest, etc.  Ask what he&#39;s<br/>\ngoing to play through first.  (Encourage him to start with something he<br/>\nknows well, to warm up.)  Ask (or remind, if you attended the lesson) what<br/>\nhis teacher was asking him to work on this week -- improving his bow grip,<br/>\nholding his viola up, whatever.  Help him do that, on the piece he knows<br/>\nwell, if needed.  (Parents can hold the instrument in the right place so the<br/>\nchild gets a feel for it, help periodically push a wrist out that&#39;s bending<br/>\nin, etc.).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen look at whatever piece(s) he&#39;s supposed to be working on right now.<br/>\nHave him play a bit of it.  One line or so.  Ask if he&#39;s happy with it.<br/>\n(It&#39;s OK if he&#39;s happy with it!)  Are there problems that need fixing?  Can<br/>\nhe go back and do it again to improve just that one thing he didn&#39;t like?<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren don&#39;t innately understand that with music, you have to figure out<br/>\nevery little bit, and it may take 5 tries to get it right.  You will have to<br/>\nhelp with that.  I find that kids get angry because it&#39;s not going well, and<br/>\nI spend a lot of time trying to teach them to not get instantly mad.   I<br/>\nteach that first, you identify the problem.  (I have them say it out loud.)<br/>\nThen decide what will solve it, and then try again.  For example, it&#39;s all<br/>\nout of tune.  Sounds awful.  I need to move my whole hand up a little bit.<br/>\nNow try it.  Or, the sound is squeaky.  I think it&#39;s my bow; it must be too<br/>\nclose to the bridge.  Let me put it farther away and try again.  (If you&#39;re<br/>\nregularly coming across problems he can&#39;t solve, it&#39;s time for a list for<br/>\nthe teacher.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, that sounds stilted.  But it&#39;s a good habit to get into, and it works.<br/>\nIt teaches the child to solve, rather than react to the problem.  Oh, and<br/>\none more thing.  When it&#39;s good, have them stop and say say so!  I see kids<br/>\nall the time who never tell themselves anything about their playing unless<br/>\nit&#39;s bad.  Well, duh, of course they don&#39;t want to practice!<br/>\n<br/>\nOther ideas: If his teacher asked him to practice some little part several<br/>\ntimes, sweeten the deal a bit.  Break out the M&M&#39;s, and put some on the<br/>\nstand.  Eat one each time you do it right.  Applaud accomplishments -- it<br/>\nmay look like no big deal to you to fix that bent wrist, but trust me, it&#39;s<br/>\na tough thing to do.  Tell your husband over dinner how well today&#39;s<br/>\npractice went.  Call the grandparents and play the piece over the phone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son tells you to go away, you&#39;re being a pest, respect that, but do<br/>\nsomething in the next room, instead.  Be prepared to be interrupted to help.<br/>\nDon&#39;t be a pest, but do be availalbe.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I tell my students&#39; parents that when their children ask to quit,<br/>\nthey need to talk about what the problem is. Do they need help practicing?<br/>\nDo they not like their teacher?  Is the instrument in need of some repair so<br/>\nit&#39;s easier to play (check with the teacher on this one)?

I&#39;ve<br/>\nalso quit music before, and I&#39;ve been playing for 25 years.
