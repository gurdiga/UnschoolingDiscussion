He lived a protected life in the palace. If he ever left,<br/>\nrunners were sent ahead to remove anything that might upset him. He married.<br/>\nHad a child. (Or children?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen one day he went out without things being cleared for him and he saw the<br/>\n4 things over 4 days that he wasn&#39;t supposed to see: a sick man, an old man,<br/>\na dead man, and an ascetic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ascetic said he&#39;d become an ascetic because of all the suffering in the<br/>\nworld. This so disturbed Siddhartha that after many days of depression he<br/>\nleft behind everything -- including his heavy earings that had deformed his<br/>\nearlobes (a sign of wealth) that are usually represented in images of him --<br/>\nto wander the land as an ascetic. He devoted himself to it and during one<br/>\nfast nearly died before someone fed him. This revived him enough for him to<br/>\nmeditate beneath a Bo Tree where he became enlightened.

When HSLDA exists and is powerful, when Michael Farris exists<br/>\nand is powerful, when large statement-of-faith-requiring southern<br/>\nhomeschooling umbrellas exist and are powerful, pointing this out and<br/>\nlisting the ways it&#39;s unhealthy isn&#39;t low tolerance, it&#39;s fighting for the<br/>\nsurvival of those not of that mindset, because these are not &quot;you say<br/>\ntomayto, I say tomahto&quot; kinda people. They won&#39;t just live and let live.<br/>\n(Sidebar: Which is a great deal of the problem and the<br/>\ndifference-in-tolerance, too: pagan, Jewish, Buddhist, atheist homeschoolers<br/>\nare not looking for converts to their faith or lack of it. There is no<br/>\nblatant or hidden agenda.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere on this list, Christian homeschooling/unschooling is the minority (at<br/>\nleast the fundamental-Christian types of homeschooling that are actually<br/>\nbeing held up as doing harmful things to homeschooling in general and their<br/>\nown families in particular), but I&#39;m betting there are still lots of people<br/>\nhere who would define themselves as Christians. They may not be speaking up<br/>\nout of fear of being yelled at, but I think it more likely that many don&#39;t<br/>\nspeak up &quot;for the side&quot; because they think that part of &quot;the side&quot; is just<br/>\nwrong and can&#39;t and won&#39;t defend it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a cradle Catholic -- the sorts of Christians Sandra talks about don&#39;t<br/>\nthink I&#39;m a Christian, but non-Christians and Catholics themselves would say<br/>\nI am, by birth and somewhat by inclination (G-d and I are still working that<br/>\npart out &lt;g&gt;) -- and I can&#39;t and won&#39;t defend what fundamentalist (for lack<br/>\nof a better term) Christians do.

I&#39;m a Christian and I&#39;m <br/>\nan unschooler.  However, there aren&#39;t any good resources out there <br/>\nthat I&#39;ve seen that are specifically for the Christian unschooler.  <br/>\nThe Christian Unschooling book is good for helping Abeka <br/>\nhomeschoolers relax, but it&#39;s more about relaxed or ecclectic <br/>\nhomeschooling as opposed to unschooling.  It talks about unit studies <br/>\nand stuff.  Christian unschooling lists also are usually more relaxed <br/>\nhomeschooling lists.  I think there&#39;s a new Christian unschooling <br/>\nbook coming out soon, so maybe that will be better. <br/>\n<br/>\nOk, you&#39;ve got me thinking about the can&#39;t spank and be a true <br/>\nunschooler thing.  I have to think about it a lot, and it might take <br/>\na couple of months. &lt;g&gt;  I still won&#39;t agree that spanking equals <br/>\nabuse, but if this comes up again in a few months, maybe I&#39;ll agree <br/>\nwith you on the spanking/unschooling thing.
