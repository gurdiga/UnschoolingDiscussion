I hadn&#39;t thought of THAT!!!  too funny, roflol!!!<br/>\n... actually, our feline friends ARE VERY RELAXED, so I think they&#39;d prob<br/>\ntake to unschooling *BEAUTIFULLY* haha ...  as far a using the computer, I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t put it past them!!! &lt;G&gt;   one of our cats ANSWERS THE PHONE, no<br/>\nfooling!!!   he knocks the receiver off and *MEOWSSSSSS*; it&#39;s HYSTERICAL!!!<br/>\nyep, @ our house the kids AND CAT try to outrun each other to answer the<br/>\nphone, haha ...<br/>\n<br/>\nwe&#39;ve always had our felines altered @ 6 mths, if you do it too early it<br/>\nwon&#39;t work (@ least, I think that&#39;s right???) ... I&#39;m w/ you, I&#39;d LOVE to<br/>\nhave TONS AND TONS of cats; I&#39;m such a sucker for cats/dogs/anything that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t SLITHER!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nuhhhh, wellllllllll, as for as the *smells*, I use a *muliple* cat litter<br/>\nand change their box out w/ fresh litter 3 x&#39;s a week ... I also rinse out<br/>\ntheir box w/ ammonia~type cleaner, let the box air outside and cover the<br/>\nbottom w/ a layer of baking soda b/f adding a plastic bag and fresh litter<br/>\n... I think the trick to controlling smells is keeping the box *cleaned* out<br/>\n... both of our cats were adopted @ the same time so they don&#39;t mind sharing<br/>\na box ... we got our last cats @ different times and the older cat was<br/>\nHORRIBLE about leaving what dh called *protest pkgs* until we figured out he<br/>\nwas upset about SHARING HIS BOX w/ a *stranger* ... so each cat had a<br/>\n*personal* box, which was a pain in the neck but easier dealing w/ than<br/>\nSURPRISES!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nhth, back to lurking :)<br/>\nPris ... ~&gt; who this past week celebrated 28th anniversary w/ the most<br/>\nwonderful fella, thank you Lord (again, I&#39;m NOT that old, I was just married<br/>\n*really~really* young when we married!!!) &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWARNING: I cannot be help responsible for the above, as apparently my cats<br/>\nhave learned how to type ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;M & J Welch&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seamus@...\">seamus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, September 02, 2000 2:05 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom]cats!!--was corporal punishment<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; That subject line is kinda&#39; strange, I know. Sorry! but my funnybone was<br/>\n&gt; tickled when imagining cats typing at a computer keyboard. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I adore cats.  I have 5, and would own more if I could stand the upkeep<br/>\n(and<br/>\n&gt; if my husband would let me!).  My problem is smell. Ugh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can the cat lovers on this list share their best remedies for that<br/>\n&gt; mystifying odor which wafts through the home containing cats? My boys and<br/>\n&gt; girls are potty trained very well.  No accidents for several weeks now.<br/>\n&gt; (Three of them are only babies-2 3 month olds and 1 6 month old.) I&#39;ve<br/>\nfound<br/>\n&gt; all the old messes and do a good smell check every day for possible new<br/>\n&gt; ones.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And does anyone know at what age a male cat can be neutered? I want to get<br/>\n&gt; my boys taken care of before any of that territorial spraying instinct<br/>\n&gt; begins to manifest itself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; AND has anyone ever tried unschooling 5 cats? :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lee<br/>\n&gt; Momma to 8 children-Seamus Abe and Henry (homo sapien sapien), and Ishtar,<br/>\n&gt; Tik Tok, Harry, Mustard and Cosmo (felis cattus)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12447,"nextTopicId":12454}}
