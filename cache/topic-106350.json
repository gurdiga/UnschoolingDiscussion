(That is a nice little interview, BTW).  After I read her interview (and still waiting) I scanned one that mentioned the importance of limiting kid&#39;s TV and computervideo game time.  I think the article was something along the lines of what to do with kids now that school is out for the summer.  It said it&#39;s ok to let your teen watch a movie and play games or surf the web - all in the same day - once in awhile, but don&#39;t let it be a habit.  Then it said that time on the computer for academics shouldn&#39;t count against the kid&#39;s screen time, thereby contradicting their earlier statement that too much *time* with TV etc. is just plain bad for kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler Waynforth","from":"&quot;Schuyler Waynforth&quot; &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyler_waynforth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Hi!

I think it is hard to abandon everything you&#39;ve invested<br/>\nin for 5 years at the suggestion of some relative strangers on a few<br/>\ninternet sites and a few yahoo chat lists.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour son will probably never get sick of television.  If you want him<br/>\nto get sick of television aversion therapy ala A Clockwork Orange is<br/>\nprobably a more effective approach than letting him watch it and enjoy<br/>\nit and relish it. And if you go so far as to sit with him and enjoy it<br/>\nwith him and to stay up until 1 am with him watching his videos and<br/>\ntalking about what he is enjoying and getting up and dancing with him<br/>\nit will never get him to the point of being sick of television.  So if<br/>\nyour goal is to get him sick of television, this isn&#39;t the route.  If<br/>\nhowever, you want him to see television as something that is a part of<br/>\nlife and as a resource for ideas and information and for zoning out<br/>\nand something that he can enjoy with other people and something to<br/>\ndance to and to explore and to leave when other things are going on,<br/>\nthen letting him watch whenever he wants is a good choice.  Joining in<br/>\nwith him is a good choice as well. Maybe if you follow his lead you&#39;ll<br/>\nbe able to see what he likes so much about television.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Simon was 5 and we let go of any controls we had on his<br/>\ntelevision watching I was highly skeptical that this was an experiment<br/>\nthat would lead him away from television.  I was right.  It didn&#39;t<br/>\nlead him away from television.  He really enjoys television.  What it<br/>\ndid lead to, after many conversations between David (dh) and myself,<br/>\nwas an understanding that television is good, that television is<br/>\nentertaining.  Yesterday we were watching an old Haley Mills movie<br/>\ncalled &quot;The Trouble with Angels&quot; which is all about how Catholic<br/>\nboarding schools are good at gently taking young troublesome girls and<br/>\nturning them into morally responsible adults (and even nuns).  It was<br/>\non in the morning and I started to notice that all of the ads were<br/>\neither about going back to school to get trained to get back to work<br/>\nor were for things like those stair lift chairs typically for elderly<br/>\nfolk and the bath lifts for getting in and out of the bath.  I pointed<br/>\nit out and we talked about why those commercials were on then instead<br/>\nof being on more in the evening.  It wasn&#39;t a long conversation, and<br/>\nat some point I was the only one watching the movie, Simon (8) started<br/>\nplaying a gamecube game and Linnaea (5) and her dad went out so she<br/>\ncould ride her bike (and she made really great skid marks on the<br/>\nconcrete and I went out after she came in so she could show me how<br/>\nlong they were and how even the two of us together couldn&#39;t get our<br/>\nlegs wide enough to span their length).  At some point later they both<br/>\ncame back and Linnaea and I had conversations about how beautiful the<br/>\ndresses were and how much she&#39;d like it if I could make some dresses<br/>\nin this very early 60&#39;s style, so I&#39;ll have to get patterns to do that<br/>\nwhen we are in the U.S. as I can&#39;t seem to find good fabric stores in<br/>\nthe UK (maybe my mom has some of the 70&#39;s ones still from my<br/>\nchildhoodI&#39;ll have to remember to ask).  And then the movie ended and<br/>\nwe had lunch and we went out to meet up with friends.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that letting go of your control over his television<br/>\nwatching isn&#39;t going to make him let go of television.  And, I guess,<br/>\nthat the trick isn&#39;t just to let go of television limits, it&#39;s to try<br/>\nand enjoy the whole thing about television with him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://waynforth.blogspot.com/\">http://waynforth.blogspot.com/</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Neha Chitale<br/>\n&lt;nishaysmom@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; in any case, as I read, i realised i was still falling into the more<br/>\n </span></blockquote>traditional & prevalent ways of doing certain things with Nishay (my<br/>\nson) & I let up  (since about 10 days now) & have been letting him<br/>\ndecide a lot more things - like what he wants to eat (he&#39;s been<br/>\nbinging on popsicles) & how much TV he wants to watch (PBS & his home<br/>\nvideos).
