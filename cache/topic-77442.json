We lived on a culdusac and I wasn&#39;t allowed to get the ball if it went <br/>\ninto the street, without asking my mom to come out to the curb and watch. To <br/>\nthis day everyone still teases her about not letting little Rhonda (she&#39;s <br/>\nRhonda also, so hence that makes me little Rhonda even though I seriously outweigh <br/>\nher, lol) cross the street until she was 12.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, I am opposite with many things Kass and Kree do. When we joined our <br/>\nfirst HS group, there is a large tree at the park where we met and the twins eyes <br/>\njust sparkled when they saw that tree. You could almost see the wheels <br/>\nturning as they were calculating their every step, before they ever reached the <br/>\ntree. I was caught a little off guard when several people mentioned that the kids <br/>\nweren&#39;t really supposed to climb it. They could get hurt. HUH? I smiled and <br/>\nsaid, &quot;I guess that&#39;s why we have great insurance.&quot; I gave them the go ahead as <br/>\nthey stopped dashing for the tree when other mom&#39;s protested. The twins are <br/>\nfamous for their lack of fear. They have always been adrenaline junkies and are <br/>\ndying to turn 12 (in 33 days, the countdown continues) so they can go <br/>\nsky-diving with one of their Karate instructors. We aren&#39;t careless mind you, we <br/>\nalways make sure whatever they do, they have safety gear and know the best way to <br/>\nfall and what not, but we don&#39;t caution them to the extent that my mom did. I <br/>\nhave often wondered why I don&#39;t freak when she did. Of course she freaks when <br/>\nthey tell her their newest quests, but they always respond with, &quot;Come on <br/>\nGrandma, do you really think Mom and Dad would let us if they didn&#39;t know we could <br/>\nhandle it?&quot; She gives me the eye and the twins crack up. I don&#39;t know if it <br/>\nwill make a difference in how they live their lives when they are parents, but <br/>\nit is odd that we are at opposite ends of the &quot;OMG it&#39;s not safe&quot; spectrum, my <br/>\nmom and I.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Re:boys/girls","postDate":"1059095977","msgId":77598,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBFRTM0MjdCLUJFM0UtMTFENy05RUY4LTAwMEE5NTZFMTA5RUBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMGQwMWMzNTI0OCQ0ODFiYTRjMCQyMDYwMWFkM0BtYXJrPg=="},"prevInTopic":77592,"nextInTopic":77607,"prevInTime":77597,"nextInTime":77599,"topicId":77442,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Personally I always talked my way out of tickets.... <br/>\n I remember once I was going 85 in a 55 mph zone and I had been with a <br/>\nfriend the night before on his motor cycle so my license was in the back <br/>\npocket of my jeans I wore, which were in a laundry basket, at the <br/>\nbottom, next to me (I was on the way to the mountains to camp.)  The <br/>\nlaundry basket was on the front seat, so Icouldn&#39;t get into the grove <br/>\ncompartment.  The cops pulled me over and asked for these two items. <br/>\n One was standing next to me, the other at the rear of the car, and I <br/>\nrealized he was laughing.  I realized that point that he was reading my <br/>\nbumper stickers, one said &quot;Women are natural leaders, you&#39;re following <br/>\none now&quot; and the other said &quot;TGIF, Thank God I&#39;m Female.&quot;  He called the <br/>\nother cop back to him and pointed these out to him and they bothed <br/>\nlaughed for a while.  Then they both came up to me and said thanks for <br/>\ngiving them a good laugh and could I please slow down at least until <br/>\nthey were no longer in site.  They never had me get out my <br/>\ndocumentation, they just chuckled.  I still have my TGIF frame on my <br/>\ncar, and I still get chuckles over it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, my 94 year old grandmother got a ticket a few years ago for <br/>\ngoing 55 or 60 in a 25 mph zone.  I am and was impressed with this and <br/>\nstill give her a hard time about her speeding.

She loves being a rough and tumble <br/>\ngirl.   I remember a month or so ago we were at a gym and Janene&#39;s shoes <br/>\nfell between the slats in the bleachers.  I asked Lexie and Carissa to <br/>\nget them out and Lexie and Carissa, who have not had a lot of <br/>\nexperiences with school bleachers looked at them for a minute perplexed, <br/>\ntrying to figure out how to do it.  Then Lexie exclaimed in a bright <br/>\nconfident voice--&quot;We can do it, Girls can do ANYTHING!&quot; and Carissa <br/>\nconfidently added &quot;Yep, Girls are POWERFUL!&quot; and off they went to get <br/>\nthe shoes.  I looked up at two young adult men (in their early 20&#39;s) who <br/>\nhad observed this, and both had this wonderful expression on their <br/>\nfaces, they had obviously so enjoyed this exchange.  I smiled at them <br/>\nand said something like &quot;there&#39;s nothing like a good strong self <br/>\nesteem!&quot; and they nodded and commented how great it was to hear the <br/>\ngirls so confident in themselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think as homeschoolers we can raise our children in a more gender <br/>\nnutural way.  At least that is my goal.  If nothing else comes of this <br/>\nunschooling, my wish is for my children to be confident and sure of <br/>\ntheir abilities to do anything, to learn anything, to become anything, <br/>\nand so that&#39;s probably why I rarely tell them they might hurt <br/>\nthemselves.  That doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t talk with them about risks that <br/>\nmight be involved in a venture, but I would never want to, even with my <br/>\nbody langauge, discourage them from trying something.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast month I was at park day when a ball was stuck on the roof of a <br/>\nshelter.  I noticed one of the boys climb up to retrieve it, and that <br/>\nthe other parents there had noticed as well.  One of the dads made his <br/>\nway over to the shelter and inquired quietly if the kids needed any <br/>\nassistance, but they didn&#39;t so he just watched.  The other parents were <br/>\nobserving but none seemed remotely concerned.  I thought about how this <br/>\nsituation would have been different had this been a group of schooled <br/>\nchildren, and I could picture the parents or teachers running to the <br/>\nshelter in fear, yelling for the child to get down, he might hurt <br/>\nhimself.  Instead the adults were simply watching, ready to give a hand <br/>\nif one was needed but marvalling at the ability of the boys.  Another <br/>\nboy shimmied up the pole and climbed up, simply to prove he could, and <br/>\nthen slid down again.  It was wonderful to watch him do that, it made me <br/>\nwish for about 20 years to come off me so Ic oudl do it too, it looked <br/>\nso fun.  Finally the ball was retrieved and the play was over and the <br/>\nkids all came down off the shelter, all perfectly safe and sound.  Not <br/>\none person said &quot;be careful&quot;--uh, I hate that phrase, like the child is <br/>\npurposely going to NOT be careful?  I always want to say, when someone <br/>\nsays &quot;Drive carefully&quot;, &quot;thanks for reminding me, otherwise I might have <br/>\ndriven crazily, speeding and running stop signs and the like.&quot;  I think <br/>\nthis goes back to trusting the children, something I am so constantly <br/>\nworking on doing.  Of course the kids will be careful, why would they <br/>\nnot be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren","from":"Ren &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"boys/girls","postDate":"1059016952","msgId":77521,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwNzIzLjIzMjMzMC4xNTcwNi4zMTA3MTJAd2VibWFpbDEyLm55Yy51bnRkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77519,"nextInTopic":77529,"prevInTime":77520,"nextInTime":77522,"topicId":77442,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-Robin- who has actually gotten a ticket for doing 120 in a 55 zone  =:O Hmmm...somehow this does not surprise me, given all of the things you are passionate","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1626475169\">-Robin-<br/>\nwho has actually gotten a ticket for doing 120 in a 55 zone  =:O<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm...somehow this does not surprise me, given all of the things you are passionate about!

He got hurt.  It was a very clear possibility that <br/>\nthis would happen.  I guess I could have just taken him off the slide or yanked <br/>\nhim off the big wheel and taken that or tried harder to reason with him but <br/>\nhaving experience with my child, the only real thing I experienced that worked <br/>\nwas to tell them when something might end up wrong and they could be hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas I instilling fear in them of scary dangerous things?  Maybe but it was <br/>\nnever my intent.  I believe I was merely providing them with information that <br/>\nthey might not have thought of beforehand.  After all it didn&#39;t seem to affect <br/>\ntwo of the children in anyway concerning physical stuff.  The girls never were <br/>\nin a position of riding a big wheel down the slide, that situation was with my <br/>\nson, who did it, did it only once. But he also tried riding it down a huge <br/>\nflight of steep stairs, off dirt piles, anything with any height to it and it <br/>\nwas a huge adventure for him.  He got some scrapes and broken bones along the <br/>\nway from all his adventures in life but they were all from choices he made.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, the differences were not pointed out to any of the children and it&#39;s <br/>\nonly in hindsight that I really noticed there were differences and that the boys <br/>\nseemed to have gotten a lot more injuries, broken bones and also had a lot <br/>\nmore adventures than the girls, or I should say PHYSICAL type adventures.  My <br/>\ndaughter likes to travel and has traveled over the summers since she was about 13 <br/>\nor maybe 14, different Countries, different places, eats LOTS of different <br/>\nfoods, enjoys it greatly.  My sons, they don&#39;t like to venture far from home at <br/>\nall and really don&#39;t enjoy exploring new places, culture and foods either.  <br/>\nMaybe that&#39;s because I always asked my daughter is she were sure she really <br/>\nwanted to be in ______ for _____ days or because the talk of all the differences <br/>\nscared them away from that.  I don&#39;t think either way instilled a fear in my <br/>\nboys or girls, I think it was simply their personalities that led them to <br/>\nexplore the adventures they&#39;ve encountered in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think it&#39;s basically the personality of the person.  They were all four <br/>\nraised with the same &quot;warnings&quot; and same surroundings and same abilities and <br/>\nsame opportunities, it was all based on ultimately their own choices and <br/>\ndesires.  Their personal differences and I guess it&#39;s the age old question as to <br/>\nwhether it has to do with their gender or just simply their personalities.  If <br/>\nyou judge by my family it would seem on the surface to be about gender because <br/>\nit&#39;s evenly divided.  I do know lots of circumstances that would dispute that <br/>\nthough.  I can only give evidence of what I&#39;ve experienced in my family.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118406848,"authorName":"Joylyn","from":"Joylyn &lt;joylyn@...&gt;","profile":"joylynrsf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Re:boys/girls","postDate":"1058970745","msgId":77447,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNGMUU5Qzc5LjcwMDA4MDNAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDE1Zi4yMzlmMjg5YS4yYzRmZWY0N0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77445,"nextInTopic":77453,"prevInTime":77446,"nextInTime":77448,"topicId":77442,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Both my girls <br/>\nlove rollercoasters, climbing trees, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have often told my children that we could hide in our house and do <br/>\nnothing to help protect ourselves from getting hurt, but the reality <br/>\nis--if we did that a plane my drop from the sky and kill us as we were <br/>\nsitting on the couch.  I&#39;d rather get out in the world and do things, <br/>\nfun things, and simply try to m inimize the risk.  For instance, we wear <br/>\nseatbelts, make sure the rollercoaster safety bars, etc. are firmly <br/>\nplaced around us, and think about what else we can do to make an <br/>\nactivity safer.  But there is no completely safe so might as well have <br/>\nfun!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also often wonder how much of our own biases we are putting on our <br/>\nchildren.  If we expect little girls to be sweet and gentle and afraid <br/>\nof rough and tumble stuff, then maybe we treat them that way and IF <br/>\ntheir personality matches or they are more moldable children then <br/>\ncomply.  If we expect boys to be rough and tumble children who like to <br/>\ngather snails and bugs, then we treat them rough and tumble like, and <br/>\nagain, this is what they are.  Nature is powerful.  Maybe those with <br/>\nchildren whose personalities go along with the sexual stereotypes of <br/>\ntheir sex are getting a lot of help from their parents expectations and <br/>\ntreatment of them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;No matter how much I tried to encourage my girls to do certain<br/>\n&gt; &gt;things that the boys found great fun, they wouldn&#39;t do it, (ride roller<br/>\n&gt; &gt; coasters for one).
