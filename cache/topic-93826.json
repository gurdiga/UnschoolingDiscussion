Science <br/>\nFiction, mostly, but sometimes he and the boys agree on something and it stays <br/>\nin the house a few days before going back.  Few of the things we rent from them <br/>\nare available in town here.  Most of the artsy video stores are out of <br/>\nbusiness, or just have videos left, not DVDs.  That leaves the mainstream (Bloc<br/>\nkbuster, Hastings, Hollywood) which tend to sell off their older things or not <br/>\nreplace them when they&#39;re lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nDisadvantages of Netflix:  You don&#39;t get the box, just an envelope with a one <br/>\nor two paragraph blurb.   If a DVD is a set, you have to request them <br/>\nseparately.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had this service for a couple of years, and we&#39;ve received one broken, <br/>\none unplayable, two have been lost after we mailed them back (and are listed <br/>\nin the missing section, they didn&#39;t charge us for them, though they might if we <br/>\nseemed dishonest or habitual).  Compared to the number that were received <br/>\nquickly and in perfect shape and returned, that&#39;s a very small number of <br/>\nfailures, considering they go through the mail in a flat envelope at pre-sort rate <br/>\n(and back postage paid).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m getting used to looking the movies up for more information instead of <br/>\nrelying on the DVD case, and it&#39;s really better that way.  We all have <br/>\ninternet.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThey e-mail when a DVD shows back up there, and then they send another e-mail <br/>\nwhen they have one packed and in the outgoing mail.  They estimate when they <br/>\nthink it will arrive, and ours come usually one day sooner, sometimes two.  <br/>\nOne single time, one came several days after the estimated arrival date.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a perfect system, but it&#39;s pretty good, and it&#39;s certainly less <br/>\ntrouble than spending a lot of time at a video store.  You can choose your movies <br/>\nin the middle of the night from your own home.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93858,"nextTopicId":93862}}
