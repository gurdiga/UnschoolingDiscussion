It&#39;s getting out of a situation you don&#39;t feel <br/>\n you have control over.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am enjoying this discussion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBarb<br/>\nE-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:barb.lundgren@...\">barb.lundgren@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it.  Boldness<br/>\nhas genius, power, and magic in it.&quot;   Goethe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\nDate: Tue, 22 Nov 2005 22:00:44 EST<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:barb.lundgren@...\">barb.lundgren@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: why might unschoolers run away?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 11/22/05 7:47:21 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:barb.lundgren@...\">barb.lundgren@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly true, and will always be true... but things can change, sometimes<br/>\nin ways we cannot predict, given outside circumstances, mental illnesses,<br/>\nnew influences, etc.  Who is to say?  I am confident I can adapt to<br/>\nanything, and offer a safe haven for my kids under all circumstances, but I<br/>\nhave seen enough and read enough biography and autobiography over the years<br/>\nto know that shit happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read much biography and autobiography of unschoolers or people whose <br/>\nchildhoods weren&#39;t controlled and limited?   Shit happens, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nturn a safe, peaceful home into a controlling, disrespectful-of-children home all <br/>\nof a sudden.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know which part of Ren&#39;s post you thought was certainly true and <br/>\nalways would be true, because the rest of your writing seems to suggest there are <br/>\nno solid principles to depend on.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew influences won&#39;t keep my children from using good judgment after their <br/>\nwhole lifetimes of making decisions based on the best of what they know at the <br/>\ntime.   If they go nuts and join cults, they still won&#39;t have to run away. <br/>\n  They can say &quot;I&#39;m going to join this cult.   See ya.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the absence of controls, how could a child rebell?   In the absence of <br/>\nbeing kept in the house, given freedom to go on road trips when they want to, and <br/>\nto stay overnight with friends when they want to, what would running away <br/>\naccomplish?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if Keith or I left or died and the other married someone creepy and <br/>\ncontrolling, that might be worth running away from.   That would mean that the <br/>\ncontract had changed, though, the nest was broken, and the child wasn&#39;t really <br/>\nleaving his home, but leaving the home of the new stepparent.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110155,"nextTopicId":109915}}
