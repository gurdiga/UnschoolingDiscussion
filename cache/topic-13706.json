Any advice?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, you might want to try asking her if she wants to try nursing. I know<br/>\nseveral moms who have done so - most of the kids took up the offer once or<br/>\ntwice but stopped when they realized they no longer knew how to get milk<br/>\nout. One mom I know did have a young child go back to nursing for awhile. If<br/>\nyou don&#39;t feel comfortable doing that, you might try to find other ways in<br/>\nwhich you can &quot;baby&quot; her. I know Mackenzie still likes to play sometimes<br/>\nthat he&#39;s the baby. He&#39;ll say &quot;I&#39;m just a little bitty baby today&quot; and we&#39;ll<br/>\npretend that he&#39;s the baby, I&#39;ll hold him in my lap and he&#39;ll crawl around<br/>\non the floor. Also he likes me to read from the journals I&#39;ve kept, I read<br/>\nhim things he was doing when he was a baby. Often I&#39;ll read to him about<br/>\nwhat he was like when he was Asa&#39;s age, the funny things he did. He likes<br/>\nthat I remember his own babyhood and can bring it back for him. Perhaps you<br/>\ncan set aside some time (I know how hard that is with a baby, but maybe<br/>\nduring naptime), just to hold her daughter in your lap and sing to her, or<br/>\ncarry her in a sling, or in some other way &quot;baby her&quot;. I think most kids at<br/>\nthis age feel this conflicting pull between big kid and baby. Although she<br/>\nmight enjoy telling you how big she is, there&#39;s another part of her that is<br/>\nreaching back for what is left behind. Honoring that is probably the best<br/>\nway to help her move past her anger and deal with the new family situation.<br/>\nAlso maybe just help her reflect her feelings - e.g. &quot;It can be hard not to<br/>\nhave mommy all to yourself anymore&quot;, &quot;It can be frustrating when the baby<br/>\ntakes up so much of mommy&#39;s time&quot;, &quot;Sometimes you wish you were still my<br/>\nlittle baby again&quot;, and see what she says.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     I am new to unschooling and am still having some trouble with it.

But I&#39;d<br/>\nreally suggest a subscription to &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot; magazine, which<br/>\nis specifically for this type of learning ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.holtgws.com/\">http://www.holtgws.com/</a> ). It<br/>\nhas a lot of great ideas, inspiration, etc. and often articles written by<br/>\nthe kids themselves. I&#39;d also recommend reading Grace Llewellyn&#39;s books &quot;The<br/>\nTeenage Liberation Handbook&quot; and &quot;Real Lives&quot;. While they are not really<br/>\naimed at parents, I got a whole lot out of them regarding unschooling. John<br/>\nHolt&#39;s books &quot;Learning All the Time&quot;, &quot;How Kids Learn&quot; and &quot;How Kids Fail&quot;<br/>\nwere also very inspirational and had good ideas about how kids learn<br/>\ndifferent subjects.<br/>\nGrace Llewllyn talks about a phenomenon when people start unschooling - that<br/>\noften they need to take some time to just do nothing. It&#39;s hard on parents<br/>\nbecause often they think that unschooling is &quot;failing&quot; because their kid is<br/>\nnot interested in anything, but this downtime helps them re-organize the way<br/>\nthey approach learning. Mostly this is in reference to kids who come out of<br/>\nschool, but I have heard families say they experienced the same thing when<br/>\ngoing from traditional structured homeschooling to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n  -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) who comments about our garden: &quot;I think a<br/>\nbulldozer would solve this weed problem&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) who loves to dance<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"DiamondAir","from":"&quot;DiamondAir&quot; &lt;diamondair@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"zRfIWZ079hfhrSYCaHUPElL4cm4wbxbfpkp2haHoJTvKqz1FlhI1n-wLSls4aARsaDvM7ufz1JWP_tqswLGG4_U4LBHRXY5EDHLxUoWz","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Extended nursing, was RE: really quiet list!!","postDate":"972060364","msgId":13716,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2YwMWMwM2FiNSQzZDExMjgwMCQ3NWRjMGUzZkBkaWFtb25kYWlyPg==","referencesHeader":"PDk3MjA1NTE4OS4zMTA4MEBlZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":13711,"nextInTopic":13717,"prevInTime":13715,"nextInTime":13717,"topicId":13706,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
