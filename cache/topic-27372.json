Here I have been thinking how well my<br/>\ndh has done with the boys playing Barbies with their sister, last Christmas<br/>\nthey even got their own Ken & Tommy dolls (they didn&#39;t want girl dolls).  And<br/>\nwhen their sister gave up Barbie for American Girl dolls I was rather sad as<br/>\nthe boys wouldn&#39;t play without her.  So finally they asked me for a boy<br/>\n&quot;american&quot; doll and I found them ones at Target.  They are so happy to be<br/>\nplaying with their sister again.  So as I am telling people I am also adding<br/>\nin yes he is such a boy climbing trees, climbing on the roof, riding his<br/>\nmotorcycle etc (he is almost 7 and the other 4 1/2).  I am guilty as charged!<br/>\nOn the otherhand, my very macho dh HAS come a long way.  He was <br/>\nraised a certain way (as I am sure most of us were) and never really said <br/>\nmuch about the boys playing dolls (probably taking solace in the fact that<br/>\nthey did other boy/manly things!)
