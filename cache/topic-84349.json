Everyone in the house has about a week and a half&#39;s worth of clothes that they REALLY like -- nothing else in their drawers or closet. We also keep our laundry baskets on a metal utility shelf by the washer and drier, and sort the clothes each day as they go to the laundry.  Then whenever a basket starts to look 1/2 full or so, it can be tipped into the washer, dried, and brought upstairs to be folded during some convenient point in the day (Lydia loves to help fold, and at 6 is actually helpful.  Jonathan also loves to help, but at 1 is mostly undoing things and helping by providing amusement.)  This system works so smoothly, it feels to me as if the laundry does itself, it makes so little demands on my life or time. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do have more than one meal&#39;s worth of dishes, but we also have a dishwasher, which to my mind makes dishes a moot issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nAck, this is turning into the household advice column, but I will just also say that in terms of time management/household efficiency stuff, I love my crockpot.  We cook vegetarian, so I can put on some kind of bean dish in the morning and dinner is done when dinner time rolls around.  We also have an electric rice cooker -- put the rice in with water, turn it on, and go away until ready. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat <br/>\n<br/>\n  Another thing with &quot;have to&quot; is that it often prevents us from seeing new<br/>\n  ways to accomplish something. If we see a tub full of dishes as an<br/>\n  inevitable consequence of cooking and eating, then it doesn&#39;t occur to us to<br/>\n  rethink the problem. But someone here said they only kept available enough<br/>\n  plates for a meal. That way they never had more than a few dishes to wash.<br/>\n  Most of us probably have too many clothes in circulation. If there aren&#39;t as<br/>\n  many clothes then laundry will be done more often but the sorting and<br/>\n  folding and returning won&#39;t be a huge chore.<br/>\n<br/>\n  (Those are just &quot;out of the box&quot; ways of viewing a couple of chores not<br/>\n  intended as suggestions for anyone to adopt.)<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Joyce<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3899762,"authorName":"coyote&#39;s corner","from":"&quot;coyote&#39;s corner&quot; &lt;jana@...&gt;","profile":"calourojm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: responsibility was:Limits/showering","postDate":"1068469521","msgId":84349,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA4MzQwMWMzYTc4YiQ0YzQ2ZmZjMCQxNGRjMDA0NEBBb3Blbj4=","referencesHeader":"PEJCRDQ1REVELjIwQTk1JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":84363,"prevInTime":84348,"nextInTime":84350,"topicId":84349,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What is it you have to do that is so very important?
