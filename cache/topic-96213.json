Whenever we go to a craft<br/>\nfair, store, etc., and I see something that my brain says, &quot;That would be<br/>\neasy to make!&quot; I point it out to her as something she could make if she<br/>\nwanted and sell at a craft fair or on my website, etc.  She&#39;s liked a few of<br/>\nthe ideas but hasn&#39;t wanted to do it.  Things like the pretty fluffy hair<br/>\nties (which she always wants to buy!) that are just ribbons knotted around<br/>\nelastic with a few beads on the end.  She&#39;s also thought about trying to<br/>\nsell birthday cards to her grandparents.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve also started a notebook in which she can gluepictures of, draw, or<br/>\nwrite the things she wants.  She&#39;s had a ton of fun looking through catalogs<br/>\nand pasting pics into the notebook.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow when she comes to me with a want, and I can&#39;t afford it, I can say, &quot;You<br/>\nshould add that to your notebook!&quot;  and if she replies, &quot;But I don&#39;t want to<br/>\nwait so much to get it,&quot; I can suggest she earn some money.  So far she&#39;s<br/>\nsaid, &quot;No thanks,&quot; but I don&#39;t feel guilty saying no anymore.  I think if<br/>\nshe really wants something she has enough means to get it, and that she&#39;s<br/>\njust having fun &quot;wanting,&quot; the same way I have fun planning my dream home or<br/>\nogling embroidery machines with no real expectation of ever owning them.<br/>\n:-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso reflected on the dance class issue some more, and don&#39;t feel so bad<br/>\nabout that either.

Morgaine is also starting to &quot;get&quot; saving for a home . she<br/>\nhas been acting out a lot lately, and when I ask her what&#39;s going on, she<br/>\nsays, &quot;I just want some privacy,&quot; or expresses a need for personal space.<br/>\nShe spends a lot of time now planning for how she&#39;ll decorate her room when<br/>\nshe gets it.
