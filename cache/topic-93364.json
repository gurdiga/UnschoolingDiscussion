If it bothers her and <br/>\nshe wants to maintain continuity, find out how often she needs to go <br/>\nto maintain her level and make it a point to get to a pool that <br/>\noften. Both of our kids love to swim, so we plan at least one family <br/>\nswimming night a week, though we try to do more (especially in the <br/>\nsummer!). It&#39;s entirely possible that if they went long enough <br/>\nwithout swimming, they might forget part or all of how to do it. I <br/>\nwas amazed that a 10 day vacation was enough to wipe my daughter&#39;s <br/>\nmemory of most of the violin music she plays by memory. She forgot <br/>\nall the way down to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Because she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave as much musical knowledge - hand/finger connections, ear/finger <br/>\nconnections, years of listening to and playing music as I (a grown-<br/>\nup) does, it fled her memory faster than it did mine.
