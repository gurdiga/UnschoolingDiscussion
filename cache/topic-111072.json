The replies were very helpful, including the suggestions of games. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We have had a set of Yahtzee dice floating around, having lost the game pad and shaker cup. I found them recently and had them put up on the mantlepiece for &quot;later.&quot; <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Logan found them and we just sat down to play with them for awhile, each of us with two dice, rolling and counting the tops. Of course, it wasn&#39;t long before the girls came to see what we were doing, and grabbing the dice away from us trying to play. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I started to get annoyed and irritated, but I thought, no..let them play too. So I let them roll and I counted for them. Then it hit me..I should buy alot of dice of varying types so that it&#39;s not even close to being a problem. I know there are some very neat dice out there for gaming, and I think we could have alot of fun all six of us throwing dice around.
