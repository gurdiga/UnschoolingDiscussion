Fast, effective, but <br/>\nharsh. Or 2) weeks of training with treats (if he&#39;s a chow hound) and a <br/>\nwilling, brave chicken. Time-consuming but gentler.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shock collar can be purchased (and sometimes rented) from a trainer. He <br/>\nmust wear the collar ALWAYS, and you must be willing to zap him whenever he <br/>\neven thinks about chasing a bird. The first time is HORRIBLE.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gentler training would start in an enclosed area, on lead. I&#39;d start with <br/>\na chicken wing on a long string. Pull the string and make the wing move. If <br/>\nhe goes for it, snap the lead. If he doesn&#39;t, &quot;good boy&quot; and a treat. <br/>\nGradually, as he becomes trust-worthy with the wing, add a calm chicken. Then <br/>\nwilder and wilder chickens. After he&#39;s trustworthy in the pen, move to an <br/>\nopen area---and start over with the wing (maybe a new wing by now (but you <br/>\nCAN freeze it)) and move on to the calm and wild chickens. He&#39;s ALWAYS on <br/>\nlead. Then go back to the pen without a lead, If he&#39;s trustworthy there, go <br/>\nto the open. If you&#39;ve done your job, he should be fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he EVER stumbles, go back two or three steps and try again. He&#39;s a dog. <br/>\nThat&#39;s the hardest thing for people to remember. He has instincts, and the <br/>\n&quot;hunt and chase&quot; one is HUGE. As someone said earlier, that&#39;s what we&#39;ve used <br/>\nto OUR benefit to  produce dogs that fox hunt, bird hunt, herd, drive,----so <br/>\nmany things we&#39;ve manipulated this instinct for.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo do something as simple as to train him to lie down immediately on command <br/>\n(WITHOUT FAIL, every time you say it) could stop the drive (override it) to <br/>\nchase and kill chickens. It wouldn&#39;t stop the desire, but stop the motion. In <br/>\norder to TRUST him, you need to stop the desire.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: killer dogs","postDate":"1040235395","msgId":52245,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxY2QwMWMyYTZjMyRkNDI3YjIwMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDIxMjE3LjIxNDMzOS4xNzQ0LjcuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":52120,"nextInTopic":52302,"prevInTime":52244,"nextInTime":52246,"topicId":52112,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
