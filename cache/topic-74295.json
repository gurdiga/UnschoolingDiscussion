This <br/>\n&gt; paragraph in particular, hit a nerve of mine. When Kass &Kree were in the <br/>\n&gt; last <br/>\n&gt; class in which they attended school, at parent teacher conference, their <br/>\n&gt; teacher <br/>\n&gt; went on and on about Kree&#39;s inability to complete the timed multiplication <br/>\n&gt; quizes. She had gone so far as to give her a &quot;D&quot; on her report card. Kree <br/>\n&gt; sat <br/>\n&gt; with me in tears and was basically falling apart as the teacher went on and <br/>\n&gt; on <br/>\n&gt; about the importance of knowing these tables. So, being my usual self, I <br/>\n&gt; turned <br/>\n&gt; to Kree. &quot;Honey, please don&#39;t cry. If you want to work on them at home I <br/>\n&gt; will <br/>\n&gt; help you.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ms. White chimed in with, &quot;Kree, you are very lucky to have a mom who is so <br/>\n&gt; understanding. Mrs. Hill you wouldn&#39;t believe how many parents I get who <br/>\n&gt; would <br/>\n&gt; punish their kids for what I just told you.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Knowing this woman enough to know she was trying to tell me I should be more <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; upset and consider punishment, I turned back to Kree.  &quot;But if you just <br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; ready, that&#39;s ok too, because these grades mean nothing.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ms. White&#39;s eyebrows rose and she asked Kree to leave so we could &quot;talk&quot;. I <br/>\n&gt; said, &quot;No, this is Kree&#39;s education, so it&#39;s important that she know where <br/>\n&gt; we <br/>\n&gt; each stand. And from where I stand, you haven&#39;t done such a hot job. If, in <br/>\n&gt; fact, these timed quizzes have been something Kree has been having <br/>\n&gt; difficulty <br/>\n&gt; with, why would you wait until now, at report card time to tell me about it. <br/>\n&gt; You <br/>\n&gt; are well aware of how much time I spend with the girls and with the amount <br/>\n&gt; of <br/>\n&gt; homework you send home, I wonder what it is you do all day in class. <br/>\n&gt; Therefore, to assume I would be upset in any way with my child, you go too <br/>\n&gt; far in your <br/>\n&gt; assumptions. I don&#39;t blame her for not doing well on your silly quizzes, but <br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; do blame you for putting far too much importance on such a trivial thing. So <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I will work on them with her, if she wants to, but if she has been too <br/>\n&gt; traumatized by the whole thing, why would I further traumatize her at home?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Her answer: &quot;Because if she doesn&#39;t get them down, she will be held back.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was shocked. &quot;Over the ability to quickly state times tables, you would <br/>\n&gt; risk a childs psyche and love of learning? Not the fact that she knows them, <br/>\n&gt; but <br/>\n&gt; that she isn&#39;t fast enough to write them? How pathetic is that?&quot; With that I <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; asked Kree to get her sister from the swings just outside of their <br/>\n&gt; classroom. <br/>\n&gt; My question was retorical, so when she began to answer, she got the &#39;talk to <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; the hand sign, cuz these ears aren&#39;t listening&#39; sign. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Huh!!! It was the following week I took them out of school to live a life of <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; peace and joy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rhonda - the ranting ENFP<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When Julian entered the third grade, he believed he was smart, especially in <br/>\nmath. After a year of pointless timed tests, Julian believed he was stupid, <br/>\nespecially in math.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he left, we told him that unless he wanted to, he never had to memorize <br/>\nthe times tables. It seemed so stupid to destroy a child&#39;s belief in himself <br/>\nover information that could be carried around on something the size of a credit <br/>\ncard.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe read Math Phobia, by Marilyn Burns, that talks about how math is taught in <br/>\nschools, and she talks about timed tests, and the ongoing nightmares kids <br/>\nhave about them.
