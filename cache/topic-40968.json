He<br/>\ngets bullied by classmates because he breaks out in song at &quot;inappropriate&quot;<br/>\ntimes.  He loves to read, he&#39;s not up on pop culture and he looks different<br/>\n(not cool).  The author, a former school teacher describes British schools as<br/>\nsmelling of disinfectant.  He doesn&#39;t seem keen on the traditional school<br/>\nsystem.  They made a movie from this book starring Hugh Grant.  I can&#39;t wait<br/>\nto see it.  I think he&#39;s perfect casting as the irresponsible playboy.  He&#39;s<br/>\nhonest despite himself.  I&#39;m only half-way through but I recommend it, it&#39;s<br/>\nvery funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nCherry in GA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40972,"nextTopicId":40974}}
