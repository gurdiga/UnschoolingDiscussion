I was ready to call social services to have this kid evaluated.  I <br/>\n really thought that he had some kind of &quot;disorder&quot;  He grew out of it and as <br/>\n I reflect, I really think that it had to do with him dealing with his anger <br/>\n over his new sibling.  I honestly don&#39;t think the jealously really hit until <br/>\n she showed signs of being a &quot;person&quot;.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWow, you mean my dd could really be just behaving normal for a 3yr <br/>\nold.......hee hee.....you mean, I shouldn&#39;t call and have her <br/>\nevaluated!!!!&lt;gasp&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for behavior problems, when my dd acts out, I tell her that if she can&#39;t <br/>\nbehave appropiately then she is telling me she needs to be by herself for <br/>\nawhile....then I help her to her room.  I let her know that when she is ready <br/>\nto be kind (behave appropiately a.k.a not hitting, smashing her brothers head <br/>\ninto the floor, putting out her feet to trip him, or taking his toys ) then <br/>\nshe can rejoin us.....this seems to work.  Although some days it takes <br/>\nseveral trips to the bedroom before she realizes I am serious.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also do prevention, prevention, prevention, as much as possible...like <br/>\neating often, as much sleep as they are willing to do, tons of attention <br/>\n(although sometimes we just get to busy in our day to day living to remember <br/>\nto stop and do focus play.  Believe me, she acts out when we have been going <br/>\nto much and need a couple of days just at home to rest.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI love to read so here are some of my favorite parenting books which I have <br/>\nto re-read often:<br/>\nLove and Anger- great when I am letting my buttons being    pushed.<br/>\nLove and Limit- good for working through behavior   &quot;problems&quot;.  It is more <br/>\nlike a 48 pg workbook.  This is the     book that told me 3yr are trying to <br/>\nfigure out and obtain   power in their enviroment (which cleared up tons for <br/>\nme)<br/>\nThe Discipline Book by Dr Sears<br/>\nKids are Worth it!<br/>\nRaising your Spirited Child- this is one of my most favorites!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12115,"nextTopicId":12171}}
