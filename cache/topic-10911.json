As a low <br/>\nglycemic sweetener, Sweet Balance is beneficial to almost any dietary <br/>\nprogram.  It&#39;s safe for diabetics, children, pregnant and nursing mothers, <br/>\nhypoglycemics, and anyone with special dietary restrictions.&quot;                   <br/>\n                                                                &quot;Sweet <br/>\nBalance is not a chemical sweetener or an herbal sweetener.  It is a natural, <br/>\nfruit sweetener that is safe for use by anyone... Most people don&#39;t know <br/>\nthis, but Equal, Sweet &#39;n Low, Spoonable stevia, and stevia packets contain <br/>\nhigh glycemic fattening ingredients... Sweet Balance is low glycemic.  It is <br/>\nexcellent for those concerned with hyperactivity, dyslexia, and tooth decay.&quot;   <br/>\n                                                                                <br/>\n&quot;The Glycemic Research Institute in Wash. DC has given Sweet Balance their <br/>\nSeal of Approval. along with their special Pediatric Seal of Approval.&quot;         <br/>\n                                                                        Hope <br/>\nthis helps!  :)  ~Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10909,"nextTopicId":10914}}
