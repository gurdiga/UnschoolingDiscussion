I have been<br/>\nreading here for a few months now and really enjoying the discussions<br/>\nthat come up on this list.<br/>\nToday, while giving my daughter a bath, I had my first real<br/>\nunderstanding of unschooling.  She was in the tub and and playing with<br/>\nher bath toys that are little foam letters.  So I picked one up and<br/>\nasked if she knew which letter it was, she answered and then asked me<br/>\nif I knew what letter it was.  My first thought was &quot; Am I being to<br/>\nschool like?&quot;, &quot; Am I pushing her to know her letters?&quot;.  These are<br/>\nvery common examples of my thoughts lately, I overanalyze everything.<br/>\nSo I continued to play the letters game with her and finally<br/>\neverything just clicked.    We were having so much fun and it didnt<br/>\nmatter if it was letters or colors or ducks we were playing with. <br/>\nThere was such a happy energy in the air while we went back and forth<br/>\nasking eachother what the letters were, so I just went with it.  Sage<br/>\nthen started asking me what color the letters were so we played that<br/>\ngame for a while, and then we played with all of the rubber duckies too.<br/>\nMy point is that for the first time I wasn&#39;t worried about what we<br/>\nwere doing and what she might be learning from it, I just focused on<br/>\nhow much fun we were having and how wonderful it felt.  Right now Sage<br/>\nis sitting on the living room floor all wrapped up in her monkey<br/>\ntowel, watching her favorite Dora movie, and eating a slice of<br/>\nleftover pizza...all things she requested and I gave her because I<br/>\nwanted to keep that happy smile on her face and that positive energy<br/>\nin our house.  She has since told my husband that she would like to go<br/>\noutside so she can spit and blow fire, I guess there is a great game<br/>\nof playing dragons in our future today!!<br/>\nThanks to everyone who posts on this list, I have learned so much from<br/>\nyou all!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112730,"nextTopicId":112732}}
