As opposed to labelling them<br/>\nwhatever and doing what some psychologist said would work for a child<br/>\nwith that whatever.<br/>\nAs a parent I think I have a resposibility to pay attention and respond<br/>\nto the needs of my child.  Do you think I should just let him flounder<br/>\nuntil he figures it out for himself???  If not, why do you object so<br/>\nvehemently to the statement that Unschooling frees us to figure out what<br/>\nthey need?<br/>\n<br/>\n          Bridget<br/>\n                                Nollaig Shona  --  S�och�in ar domhan, <br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n     In three words I can sum up everything I&#39;ve learned about life: it<br/>\ngoes on.<br/>\n                                                     - Robert Frost</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28860,"nextTopicId":28903}}
