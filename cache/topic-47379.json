I think you and I are on the same wavelength.  These <br/>\nverses say that a person is not &quot;saved&quot; by works, but the works do <br/>\ngive evidence of the faith of person.  So while Ephesians 2:10 <br/>\nsays, &quot;For we are God&#39;s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do <br/>\ngood works, which God prepared in advance for us to do&quot;, the verse <br/>\njust before it says, &quot;(You are saved by faith)...not by works, so <br/>\nthat no one can boast.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a person tells us s/he has faith in God, but we see little or no <br/>\nevidence of it (and no good works), we have a strong case to wonder <br/>\nabout her/his faith.

No church (members or minister) is perfect, and some <br/>\nchurches are farther away from teaching the Bible than others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There was perpetual fear over Satan getting ahold of you, or those <br/>\n&gt; horrid wordly influences creeping in.

The Bible indicates that God created us to enjoy him.
