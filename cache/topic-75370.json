That all sounds yummy to me.  Just add in some good old-world cheese and yogurt and an occasional serving of chocolate ice cream for me &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a sincere question re: natural diet.  Some foods are obviously natural, such as fruit from a tree or a freshly caught fish.  But once it is processed in some way, how can it truly be &quot;natural&quot;?  Is cooked meat a natural food?  It is certainly normal for humans, but so is consuming milk (at least for some humans!).  What about tofu?  That is very processed, yet has been an important part of the Asian diet for centuries, certainly part of their natural diet.  Many cultures use a lot of salt to cure foods, or they dry foods to prevent spoilage, and without these techniques they might have starved and died off.  What about when people move from their native country - should they continue to eat their old diet, or would it be more natural to switch to the diet of their new country?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I love my vegetables and have found that I *need* to eat lots of fresh vegies to feel good.  My tastes have changed enormously since I was a child.  I generally prefer less sweet foods now, except for fresh, juicy fruit, which I always enjoy.  And chocolate.  Which probably isn&#39;t at all natural, but sure makes me happy :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":148876365,"authorName":"barefootwisteria","from":"&quot;barefootwisteria&quot; &lt;barefootwisteria@...&gt;","profile":"barefootwisteria","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Dairy history in the US","postDate":"1056486981","msgId":75375,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJkYWNvNSs0YnEzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNDMwMWMzM2E4ZiQ1Nzc3YThlMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":75373,"nextInTopic":75390,"prevInTime":75374,"nextInTime":75376,"topicId":75370,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes.
