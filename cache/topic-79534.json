What<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if you signed up for something you realized you didn&#39;t like after a couple<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of months? How would you feel if your husband insisted you stick with it <br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the next 6 years because you signed up for it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I totally agree with what everyone is saying on this, but what about <br/>\n&gt; following through on something you commit yourself to?  What if he <br/>\n&gt; gets a job and signs a two year contract to work for someone, he <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t just quit, because he signed a contract to work for that <br/>\n&gt; person.  This kind of speaks to a real life situation.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I understand your fears, but think of it this way: if he were in that <br/>\nsituation, it&#39;d be a real-world situation, and there he&#39;d be. (And really, there <br/>\naren&#39;t that many of those in the world.) In this case, it&#39;s a pretend situation, <br/>\nbecause he COULD quit. Why not let him have that opportunity if he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere might be an out on the whole program. If not, he&#39;ll still have the <br/>\nmaterials, and without the pressure, he might or might not be able to use them as <br/>\nresources for studying photography the way he wants to. He can take a lot of <br/>\npictures, get better, and use those materials to learn how to make them better <br/>\nor to market them. Or maybe he&#39;ll do something else entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nThirteen is awfully young to commit to two years, much less what he wants to <br/>\ndo for the rest of his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, both of you have learned something really valuable here: sometimes <br/>\nbefore making a long, expensive commitment, it&#39;s a good idea to explore other <br/>\noptions, and really think about how you want to do something. <br/>\n<br/>\n{{{Judie!}}}}   Thanks for trying so hard to find what your kids need.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79518,"nextTopicId":79276}}
