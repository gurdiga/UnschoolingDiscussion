Then I read some John Holt and quickly got converted to<br/>\n&gt; unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What drew me in to the conversation at this point is the debate over<br/>\n&gt; Christian vs. inclusive groups. As my kids are so young, I haven&#39;t yet<br/>\n&gt; started looking into the groups that may be available here, so I can&#39;t<br/>\ntell<br/>\n&gt; you to which type of group I belong. But I will say this, even though I am<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; Christian and could in all good conscience sign a statement of faith and<br/>\n&gt; join such a group, I probably would not. Christianity by its very nature<br/>\n&gt; should be inclusive and these types of groups sometimes give Christians a<br/>\n&gt; bad name. I don&#39;t mean to insult anyone who belongs to such a group, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; sure they offer great support. But I did not choose to keep my kids out of<br/>\n&gt; school in order to keep them isolated from the greater world, but to<br/>\nimmerse<br/>\n&gt; them in it. Part of that is meeting people who do not share our beliefs<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; learning from them.
