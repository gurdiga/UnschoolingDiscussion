January 2000: Kathleen Robertson of Austin Texas was awarded  $780,000 by<br/>\na jury of her peers after breaking her ankle tripping over a  toddler who<br/>\nwas running amuck inside a furniture store. The owners of the store were<br/>\nunderstandably surprised at the verdict, considering the misbehaving little<br/>\nbrat was Ms. Robertson&#39;s own son.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. June 1998: A 19 year old Carl Truman of Los Angeles won $74,000 and<br/>\nmedical expenses when  his neighbor ran over his hand with a Honda  Accord.<br/>\nMr. Truman apparently didn&#39;t notice there was someone at the wheel of the<br/>\ncar, when he was trying to steal his neighbor&#39;s hubcaps.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. October 1998: A Terrence Dickson of Bristol Pennsylvania was leaving a<br/>\nhouse he had just finished robbing by way of the garage. He was not able to<br/>\nget the garage door to go up, because the automatic door opener was<br/>\nmalfunctioning. He couldn&#39;t re-enter the house because the door connecting<br/>\nthe house and garage locked when he pulled it shut.  The family was on<br/>\nvacation. Mr. Dickson found himself locked in the garage for eight days. He<br/>\nsubsisted on a case of Pepsi he found, and a large bag of dry dog food. Mr.<br/>\nDickson sued the homeowner&#39;s insurance claiming the situation caused him<br/>\nundue mental anguish. The jury agreed to the tune of half a million dollars.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. October 1999: Jerry Williams  of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, was awarded<br/>\n$14,500 and medical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks  by his<br/>\nnext door neighbor&#39;s beagle. The beagle was on  a chain in it&#39;s owner&#39;s<br/>\nfenced-in yard, as was Mr. Williams. The award  was less than sought because<br/>\nthe jury felt the dog may  have been provoked by Mr. Williams who, at the<br/>\ntime, was shooting   it repeatedly with a pellet gun.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. May 2000: A Philadelphia restaurant was ordered to pay Amber Carson of<br/>\nLancaster, Pennsylvania $113,500 after she  slipped on a soft drink and<br/>\nbroke her coccyx. The beverage was on the floor because Ms. Carson threw it<br/>\nat her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. December 1997: Kara Walton of Claymont, Delaware successfully sued the<br/>\nowner of a night club in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom<br/>\nwindow to the floor and knocked out her two front teeth. This occurred while<br/>\nMs.Walton was trying to sneak through the window in the ladies room to avoid<br/>\npaying the $3.50 cover charge. She was awarded $12,000 and dental expenses.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. And just so you know that cooler heads do occasionally prevail: Kenmore<br/>\nInc., the makers of Dorothy Johnson&#39;s microwave, were found not liable for<br/>\nthe death of Mrs. Johnson&#39;s poodle after she gave it a bath and attempted to<br/>\ndry it by putting the poor creature in her microwave  for, &quot;just a few<br/>\nminutes, on low.&quot; The case was quickly dismissed.<br/>\n---<br/>\n IN HOC MODO MILLIS FRANGITVR . </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30647,"nextTopicId":30663}}
