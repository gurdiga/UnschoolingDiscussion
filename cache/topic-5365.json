Again, no big deal.  As long as you caught them before the<br/>\nterrible 2&#39;s it wasn&#39;t any big deal.

The others were all past 3.  The method <br/>\nthat worked pretty well for us was to take a day when we didn&#39;t have anywhere <br/>\nelse to go, have the house plenty warm, and put a long t-shirt on our child <br/>\nwithout any diaper or anything else underneath.  They seem to feel a major <br/>\ndifference and don&#39;t feel comfortable just going with nothing there.  The <br/>\nbiggest trick is getting them to go the first time in the toilet.  When that <br/>\nhappened, they were excited and yes, we did kind of cheer (not totally <br/>\ninternal rewards, I know).  After that, they wanted to keep going.  We had <br/>\nthem spend the whole day with the long t-shirt (adult size) and it seemed <br/>\nthat by the next day, it was reinforced pretty well.  It works well to be <br/>\nable to go as many days as possible before having to go somewhere.  When that <br/>\npoint finally comes, I think it&#39;s better to put on thin underwear so that it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t feel like a diaper.<br/>\n     I guess this isn&#39;t a true unschooling approach but it was an approach <br/>\nthat waited until they were plenty old enough to understand and it didn&#39;t <br/>\ninvolve getting mad at them or dragging it out for monthes with a lot of <br/>\naccidents.  I have noticed that when that happens, the parents seem to get <br/>\nmad whether they intend to or not because they get so tired of monthes of <br/>\naccidents.  I also never forced it if a child said he didn&#39;t want to.  We <br/>\njust stopped and tried it again a month or more later.  Anyway, I hope this <br/>\nhelps.  Whatever you decide to do, you know that sometime before their <br/>\nadulthood, children will learn to use a toilet!

Bribed her with a toy she<br/>\nwanted if she&#39;d stop that day.  I still regret that method.  After one<br/>\nday with the toy, she wanted to take it back and have milky again.  Whole<br/>\nstory of her nursing/weaning is long and contains aspects I&#39;m proud of<br/>\nand those I regret.  Hopefully I learned something!  She wasn&#39;t using the<br/>\ntoilet reliably until around 4 as well, and only stopped night wetting<br/>\nrecently (just turned 7).<br/>\n<br/>\n2nd dd was 4 in August & nurses anywhere from zero to 6 times in 24<br/>\nhours.  She is definitely *weaning*.  (Remember it is a process!!)  I am<br/>\ndetermined to let her nurse until she is finished.  I could write pages<br/>\non this, I&#39;m sure.  It is hardest when I&#39;m around people who feel she is<br/>\ntoo old to be nursing.  (Which is nearly everybody!)  But as I age I find<br/>\nit easier to not mind so much what others think.

Honest.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest decided to start using a toilet two weeks before his 4th<br/>\nbirthday.  No accidents ever once he decided.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other two, I don&#39;t remember.  Younger with toilet training, older with<br/>\nweaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeaning ages varied widely.  That eventually happens, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(And hey Pete, you&#39;re apparently near me!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nLinda Wyatt<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hilinda@...\">hilinda@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lightlink.com/hilinda\">http://www.lightlink.com/hilinda</a><br/>\nLearning everywhere, all the time.<br/>\nAlgebra before breakfast<br/>\n&quot;A lie, you see, no matter how often or how vociferously repeated, may be<br/>\nmistaken for the truth, but it does not become the truth.&quot; - Adam Crown</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Pete Schult","from":"Pete Schult &lt;schult@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"OJ6E9sjcJQQXhJTxA7YOYUrUy_tRkPxdkNtt7-FzYHcLFNiJuzfij6tWc8_UKX6S7KFbhAYxuP_A-8jvfB84QBVWgFIXDUHnyAcXwjBC","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Unschooling potty-training and weaning","postDate":"945705414","msgId":5365,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNDYuNTM2NS45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5366,"prevInTime":5364,"nextInTime":5366,"topicId":5365,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You read stories every day about unschoolers who don t learn to read til they re 9 or 11 and then become avid readers, so you shouldn t worry if your child","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-154164907\">You read stories every day about unschoolers who don&#39;t learn to read &#39;til<br/>\nthey&#39;re 9 or 11 and then become avid readers, so you &quot;shouldn&#39;t worry if<br/>\nyour child isn&#39;t reading at 6&quot;.
