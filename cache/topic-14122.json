I have been struggling with<br/>\nthe same thing. My 7 year old boy has alot of the<br/>\nqualities that usually are dubbed ADD or ADHD. I,<br/>\npersonally, think he is a normal , yet very active and<br/>\nenthusiastic boy. He went to public school for grades<br/>\nK-1 and we were always being called in for &quot;disruptive<br/>\nbehavior&quot; and told that he &quot;just cant seem to stop<br/>\ntalking, moving, disrupting class.&quot; We were always<br/>\nleft shaking our heads, not sure if our gut feelings<br/>\nwere right---- How can any child sit still for so long<br/>\nwithout wanting to break out and have some fun. I know<br/>\nalot of kids do it, but I couldnt see my son doing it.<br/>\nFinally, with 3 weeks left to 1st grade, we pulled him<br/>\nout. We just couldnt take it anymore! They(school)<br/>\nwere trying to tell my son he was bad, and he was<br/>\nstarting to BE bad!<br/>\nWe started off this school year with some school at<br/>\nhome. It was a disaster, and after alot of reading and<br/>\nresearch about unschooling, we decided to try it, even<br/>\nif it would be temporary. This child is blossoming<br/>\nalready! He is able to sit and read quietly, as long<br/>\nas he has made the decision to do so. If I say &quot;why<br/>\ndont you go read a book?&quot; he whines, complains, etc. I<br/>\nguess this is whst unschooling is, right? I had been<br/>\nfeeling a ton of pressure about unschooling, too,<br/>\nbacause my sister is a school teacher and I figured<br/>\nshe&#39;d be onto me if things werent working out well.<br/>\nShe is also in charge of evaluating homeschoolers in<br/>\nher school district(not mine!). She offered to<br/>\nevaluate him for me, to let me know where I stand, and<br/>\nI was really glad for this, but also VERY nervous. She<br/>\ncame last Friday, and while I paced the floor, they<br/>\nworked together for a good hour. She announced<br/>\n&quot;Congratulations Mom! You&#39;re son is at an end of third<br/>\ngrade reading level, 2nd grade writing.&quot; My heart felt<br/>\nso good. She hugged me and told me not to worry, he<br/>\nwas doing fine. I couldnt have felt better. I promised<br/>\nmyself to relax more and let my son find his way. So<br/>\nmuch of the pressure is off now, and although I am<br/>\nstill nervous, I know that atleast I dont have to<br/>\nworry about him being behind.<br/>\nI&#39;m still having trouble accepting that he&#39;ll learn<br/>\nwhat he needs without alot of textbooks and<br/>\nworksheets, but I am hoping to gain confidence through<br/>\nthis group. I realize I have really ranted here, I<br/>\nhope I&#39;m not the first!<br/>\nAny help or suggestions for this first year of our<br/>\nadventure in unschooling will be greatly appreciated.<br/>\nKerry<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; In a message dated 00-11-11 23:18:38 EST,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Burkfamily9@...\">Burkfamily9@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; -I have a 7 year old with major attention/focus<br/>\n&gt;  problems who would most likely be diagnosed ADHD if<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt;  let him be.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This one, I think, is a prime  NON-structure<br/>\n&gt; candidate.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14103,"nextTopicId":14123}}
