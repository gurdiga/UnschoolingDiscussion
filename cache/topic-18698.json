Don&#39;t buy a curriculum until <br/>\nyou&#39;ve really studied your options. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re afraid and you want to keep your foot in the schoolish water for a <br/>\nwhile, I advise using the library.  If you want &quot;a curriculum&quot; for a while, <br/>\nmake a chart.  Go get books (any books your daughter likes, but maybe go for <br/>\nillustrated non-fiction--stuff with great charts, photos, paintings).  Don&#39;t <br/>\nmake her read them.  Just looking at the pictures is good.  You look too.  <br/>\nEven without her.  See what all is in there.  You&#39;ll find cooking in a <br/>\nhistory book, and math in a science book, and science in a geography book, <br/>\nand languages in music.   Start getting used to that cross-pollination.  <br/>\nSchool doesn&#39;t encourage it, usually.  It&#39;s the key to learning, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou (the mom, not the child) take notes all you want, keep charts all you <br/>\nwant, but they&#39;re not necessary longterm.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBy next fall, if you read lots here and in books on homeschooling, you will <br/>\nprobably not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a curriculum.  You might by <br/>\nthen have spent some on art supplies (good ones, not cheapo walmart stuff)  <br/>\nand books and stuff.  But take your time.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of yahoogroups for resources, go to google.com and try looking for <br/>\nunschool and homeschool and such.  Follow links on pages.
