Hoping all is well.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI talked with Ren today. They have phone, but not electricity. Power may  not <br/>\nbe restored for 2-3 weeks. But the grocery store, hospitals, and gas  <br/>\nstations have power.<br/>\n <br/>\nHer yard was trashed---littered with debris, but her house  was practically <br/>\nuntouched by wind or water. She feels very lucky. They&#39;re  all safe and happy <br/>\nto be home. <br/>\n <br/>\nPensacola Beach, where the hotel is, is unaccessible; mandatory evacuation  <br/>\nand the bridges are out, so no one can get on to check it out.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;re not yet ruling out P&#39;cola for next year&#39;s conference. The hotels  *say* <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be up and running by the spring. We&#39;ll wait to make decisions  until <br/>\nwe hear what the real scoop is---maybe another month or so.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you want to send her cards or letters, e-mail me privately. I&#39;ll be  happy <br/>\nto give you her address or phone number.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe says she misses everyone---and thanks for all the good wishes.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99682,"nextTopicId":99524}}
