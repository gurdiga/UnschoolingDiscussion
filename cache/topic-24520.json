I was shocked that you all think<br/>\nyour way is the only way and everybody else is wrong.  Laurie&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no consensus on this list as to what is the &quot;only&quot; way. It&#39;s <br/>\nnowhere near that organized. People here represent a spectrum of beliefs and <br/>\nways of life. But we are often  challenged by some members to think about <br/>\nwhat might happen if we let go and let the kids make more of their own <br/>\nchoices. You shouldn&#39;t take it as criticism, but just as an invitation to <br/>\nexamine beliefs you take for granted. Some of the suggestions here I have <br/>\nrejected as unworkable for my family (ahem, no one is going for three weeks <br/>\nwithout washing their hair in my house) but others have made me re-examine, <br/>\nand change, some things I have believed all my life just out of habit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24518,"nextTopicId":24521}}
