The small, narrow strap-like blue-green leaves die away in early <br/>\nspring. Then seemingly out of nowhere in August, the 15&quot; tall spikes emerge from <br/>\nunderground, topped with a deciduous azalea-like flower of bright red. After <br/>\nthe flowers fade, the leaves emerge again and persist until spring, producing <br/>\nfood for next year&#39;s flowering. L. radiata doesn&#39;t always flower every <br/>\nyear...we feel the flowering is probably controlled by aliens who like to torment <br/>\nEarth-bound gardeners.<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE that, because Holly said maybe the aliens sent it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nMy neighbor, when I asked him, didn&#39;t know but said &quot;Maybe those lights on <br/>\nthe crest the other night caused it&quot; (people reported strange lights one night; <br/>\nit was a mountaintop photo shoot with bright lighting at night, we heard)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m definitely going to dig it up and move it to a safer place.   Maybe it <br/>\nwould have bloomed other years but Keith mows the lawn.   The bulbs we planted <br/>\nthere were planted seven or eight years ago, and after that we&#39;ve moved every <br/>\none we saw come up to better places.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108147,"nextTopicId":108162}}
