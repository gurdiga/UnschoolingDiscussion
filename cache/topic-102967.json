Life is learning, learning is life - you really can&#39;t apply that <br/>\nslogan to any other lifestyle. ALL others think of learning as <br/>\nsomething that happens when teaching is going on and that there are <br/>\ntimes to learn and times of not learning. Unschoolers do not think of <br/>\nlife and learning as two separate things. &quot;I live therefore I learn.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  Do unschoolers feel that it is the<br/>\n&gt; only way to homeschool successfully?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo. In fact, I don&#39;t think it is a good way for everybody. I think it <br/>\ntakes an intensity and focus on living life with a great deal of gusto <br/>\nand that a lot of people don&#39;t have that. I also think that the parents <br/>\nhave to have a certain level of sensitivity to their children to know <br/>\nwhat to offer, when to support, when to back off, how busy they want to <br/>\nbe, how much solitude they need, when to nudge them a bit with <br/>\nencouragement, when to get more involved, etc. AND parents need to be <br/>\nable to always have their kids and their interests in the back of their <br/>\nminds, thinking always about what would interest them and bringing the <br/>\nworld to them and them to the world in ways that &quot;click&quot; for that <br/>\nparticular child. It takes willingness to have important midnight <br/>\nconversations and to scoop worms out of the ground and keep them on <br/>\nyour kitchen counter and to trust as your child takes her first train <br/>\nride alone and on and on. I don&#39;t think it is right for everybody and I <br/>\nthink there are kids better off with other kinds of homeschooling <br/>\nbecause their PARENTS aren&#39;t able or willing to put the energy into <br/>\nunschooling that I think it needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Or that it is the best, right way to go about it?  Or like<br/>\n&gt; everything I have heard thusfar, there are many ways<br/>\n&gt; to go about homeschooling and unschooling is just one<br/>\n&gt; of them?  No one right way, just what works for each<br/>\n&gt; individual family?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could do the curriculum - I could insist on a few hours of day of <br/>\n&quot;school work,&quot; insisting that my children do it. But I&#39;ve read <br/>\neverything I could get my hands on about learning and I&#39;ve had 30 years <br/>\nof teaching experience and I know, deep down inside, that any coercion <br/>\nin learning creates either active resistance, passivity, or apathy and <br/>\nI don&#39;t want to create any of those in my children. Learning feels good <br/>\n- it might be hard, but it is also pleasurable. Coercion feels bad and <br/>\ntrying to learn under coercion is not pleasurable. Children who have <br/>\nonly experienced the pleasure of unforced learning have an entirely <br/>\ndifferent approach to life - they have not developed resistance, <br/>\npassivity, or apathy and it shows in their incredible creativity, <br/>\nconfidence, intensity, focus, persistence, self-knowledge, and personal <br/>\nresponsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all parents WANT their children to grow up strong-willed and truly <br/>\nindependent-minded. Many parents mostly want their children to respect <br/>\nthem and to adopt their beliefs and goals. Many parents have a <br/>\ndefinition of &quot;success&quot; already in their own heads and what they want <br/>\nis for their children to achieve success as they define it. Many want <br/>\ntheir children to offer living proof that they were good parents - <br/>\nthey&#39;re especially interested in outcomes that will impress friends, <br/>\nrelatives, and acquaintances.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers have different goals that impact our day-to-day <br/>\ninteractions with our kids. We want our children to discover their <br/>\nlife&#39;s passions and to jump into them with both feet, with confidence <br/>\nand trust in life and themselves. We want our children to know, deep <br/>\ninside themselves, that they are strong and capable and can make their <br/>\nown individual choices. We want them to be willing to buck the <br/>\nmainstream culture AND buck the counterculture and think for themselves <br/>\nand do what they think is right and good and worthy and valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, most of all, we want them to love being alive - now and in <br/>\ntheir future.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

It says, &quot;The state board of education shall not require these children to meet the student learning goals, master the essential academic learning requirements,...&quot;     &quot;If, as a result of the annual test or assessment, it is determined that the child is not making reasonable progress consistent with his or her age or stage of development, the parent shall make a good faith effort to remedy any deficiency.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a stickler for being precise in what our law says vs. how people interpret it.

At least that is what a teacher who gives the assessment has said.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know any teachers IRL who understand unschooling well enough to do an assessment.  This is one reason I do my assessments through FLO.  They do not read anything into the law&#39;s stated purpose of doing the assessment.  They do what the law requires and no more.  *I* do the assessment.  My children do not even need to be aware of it.

ALL others think of learning as <br/>\nsomething that happens when teaching is going on and that there are <br/>\ntimes to learn and times of not learning.

I think it <br/>\ntakes an intensity and focus on living life with a great deal of gusto <br/>\nand that a lot of people don&#39;t have that. I also think that the parents <br/>\nhave to have a certain level of sensitivity to their children to know <br/>\nwhat to offer, when to support, when to back off, how busy they want to <br/>\nbe, how much solitude they need, when to nudge them a bit with <br/>\nencouragement, when to get more involved, etc. AND parents need to be <br/>\nable to always have their kids and their interests in the back of their <br/>\nminds, thinking always about what would interest them and bringing the <br/>\nworld to them and them to the world in ways that &quot;click&quot; for that <br/>\nparticular child. It takes willingness to have important midnight <br/>\nconversations and to scoop worms out of the ground and keep them on <br/>\nyour kitchen counter and to trust as your child takes her first train <br/>\nride alone and on and on. I don&#39;t think it is right for everybody and I <br/>\nthink there are kids better off with other kinds of homeschooling <br/>\nbecause their PARENTS aren&#39;t able or willing to put the energy into <br/>\nunschooling that I think it needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or that it is the best, right way to go about it?

No one right way, just what works for each<br/>\n&gt; individual family?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We could do the curriculum - I could insist on a few hours of day of <br/>\n&quot;school work,&quot; insisting that my children do it. But I&#39;ve read <br/>\neverything I could get my hands on about learning and I&#39;ve had 30 years <br/>\nof teaching experience and I know, deep down inside, that any coercion <br/>\nin learning creates either active resistance, passivity, or apathy and <br/>\nI don&#39;t want to create any of those in my children. Learning feels good <br/>\n- it might be hard, but it is also pleasurable. Coercion feels bad and <br/>\ntrying to learn under coercion is not pleasurable. Children who have <br/>\nonly experienced the pleasure of unforced learning have an entirely <br/>\ndifferent approach to life - they have not developed resistance, <br/>\npassivity, or apathy and it shows in their incredible creativity, <br/>\nconfidence, intensity, focus, persistence, self-knowledge, and personal <br/>\nresponsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all parents WANT their children to grow up strong-willed and truly <br/>\nindependent-minded. Many parents mostly want their children to respect <br/>\nthem and to adopt their beliefs and goals. Many parents have a <br/>\ndefinition of &quot;success&quot; already in their own heads and what they want <br/>\nis for their children to achieve success as they define it. Many want <br/>\ntheir children to offer living proof that they were good parents - <br/>\nthey&#39;re especially interested in outcomes that will impress friends, <br/>\nrelatives, and acquaintances.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers have different goals that impact our day-to-day <br/>\ninteractions with our kids. We want our children to discover their <br/>\nlife&#39;s passions and to jump into them with both feet, with confidence <br/>\nand trust in life and themselves. We want our children to know, deep <br/>\ninside themselves, that they are strong and capable and can make their <br/>\nown individual choices. We want them to be willing to buck the <br/>\nmainstream culture AND buck the counterculture and think for themselves <br/>\nand do what they think is right and good and worthy and valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, most of all, we want them to love being alive - now and in <br/>\ntheir future.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":172750465,"authorName":"b229d655@cs.com","from":"b229d655@...","profile":"robeyboyz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] My first post and a question please","postDate":"1107268995","msgId":102999,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjMS4yMmMxZGFhOS4yZjMwZWY4M0Bjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":102996,"nextInTopic":103003,"prevInTime":102998,"nextInTime":103000,"topicId":102967,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/1/2005 7:11:08 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...

But once<br/>\nyou see a child manipulating numbers in his head because he understands how<br/>\nnumbers can be morphed to make the answer he wants come out, then you can<br/>\nstart to understand what &quot;unschooling math&quot; really is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do unschoolers feel that it is the<br/>\n&gt; only way to homeschool successfully?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depends on your meaning of success.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a parent&#39;s goal is to get their child into Harvard, is unschooling the<br/>\nonly (or best) way? No. In fact unschooling would be a poor way to meet that<br/>\ngoal.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Though unschooled kids do get into Harvard. The difference is that it&#39;s the<br/>\nchild&#39;s goal to go, not the parent&#39;s. The child reachs out and prepares<br/>\nhimself because that&#39;s what he wants rather than the parent pushing what she<br/>\nthinks is necessary into the child.)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers generally have different goals than most people. Unschoolers<br/>\naren&#39;t trying to shape their kids into being the best they can be (or<br/>\nhowever a parent words it). Unschoolers are trying to help their kids be who<br/>\nthey already are.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo neither curriculum or unit studies or eclectic homeschooling or any of<br/>\nthe other homeschooling methods are going to move an unschooling parent<br/>\ntowards that goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or like<br/>\n&gt; everything I have heard thusfar, there are many ways<br/>\n&gt; to go about homeschooling and unschooling is just one<br/>\n&gt; of them?  No one right way, just what works for each<br/>\n&gt; individual family?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depends on your goals. Depends on your priorities.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is very relationship oriented. It&#39;s about being a child&#39;s<br/>\npartner in the child&#39;s exploration of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther methods are more oriented towards helping a parent get what a parent<br/>\nwants into a child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think I stand by my earlier statement, we all want<br/>\n&gt; what is best for our children.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think Sandra&#39;s point in pulling this out is to help you see that while<br/>\nwanting what&#39;s best for our children may be true of all &quot;good&quot; parents on<br/>\nthe surface, not all parents define best the same way. So if we assume we<br/>\nall want &quot;what&#39;s best&quot; and go about talking about &quot;what&#39;s best&quot;, people will<br/>\nthink they&#39;re all talking about the same thing but some may be defining best<br/>\nas obedience to God, getting a child into Harvard, helping a child be happy,<br/>\nturning the child into a well rounded person, helping a child be kind and so<br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t one way to get to all those definitions of &quot;best&quot;! In fact some<br/>\nways will be incompatible with some definitions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it will help you help yourself better if you think about what you mean by<br/>\n&quot;best for your child&quot;. What do you want to give him or help him get? (And an<br/>\nunschooler will ask, what does your son want? And how can you help him get<br/>\nthat? :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sorry, I dont perceive all tests as cutthroat<br/>\n&gt; competion or as useless.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually your original question wasn&#39;t about all tests but &quot;these tests&quot;,<br/>\nthe state required tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in answer to your question:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do<br/>\n&gt; unschoolers see these tests as useless, meaningless<br/>\n&gt; and just a  formality to go through in order to keep<br/>\n&gt; the government happy but promptly  ignore them once<br/>\n&gt; they are over?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s kind of a sticky, tricky question! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Unschooler&quot; is a self applied label rather than a title given to those who<br/>\nfully get unschooling. So people who call themselves unschoolers can still<br/>\nhave all sorts of school-think baggage that they&#39;re working on getting rid<br/>\nof. So it&#39;s hard to answer questions in terms of &quot;Do unschoolers think ...?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s more helpful to think in terms of what ideas help people unschool and<br/>\nwhat ideas don&#39;t help.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who really &quot;get&quot; unschooling understand the meaninglessness of the<br/>\nstate mandated tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting to and really understanding why the tests are meaningless will help<br/>\nsomeone get unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126169380,"authorName":"elizabeth braddock","from":"elizabeth braddock &lt;elizabeth_braddock2002@...&gt;","profile":"elizabeth_braddock2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] My first post and a question please","postDate":"1107242103","msgId":102993,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMjAxMDcxNTAzLjc4MjE0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUwNjA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNTIwMWM1MDgwYiRjMDViZWVjMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBob21lPg=="},"prevInTopic":102992,"nextInTopic":102994,"prevInTime":102992,"nextInTime":102994,"topicId":102967,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The<br/>\nlaw also reads that if your child appears to be<br/>\nlacking in any area then that area will be pointed out<br/>\nso that the parent can make a concerted effort to<br/>\nrectify the situation and bring the child up to speed<br/>\nin that area or areas.  I too will go with the<br/>\nnon-assessment test as I have heard it is less<br/>\nstressful, etc.  But even with that it still is a<br/>\nmeasuring yardstick of your child and your progress in<br/>\nhomeschooling.

Thanks very much for the article.  I<br/>\nlook forward to reading it.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Standardized tests will never cover 11 subject<br/>\n&gt; areas.  They cover  reading <br/>\n&gt; and math and maybe grammar.  IF they have a science<br/>\n&gt; or history  section, that <br/>\n&gt; too will be reading (read this passage and answer<br/>\n&gt; some multiple  choice <br/>\n&gt; questions or read each question and pick the least<br/>\n&gt; ridiculous  answer).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote> I based my assumption on a few different responses<br/>\nfrom other homeschoolers, ex-unschoolers and a couple<br/>\nof teachers in my area.  I guess in the sense that<br/>\nthey read a passage that may pertain to social studies<br/>\nor science, etc. it is in fact touching on most of the<br/>\n11 subjects.  But given the climate of fear there is<br/>\nin my area regarding unschooling my question I thought<br/>\nwas a valid, intelligent one and who better to ask<br/>\nthan actual unschoolers who Im sure only want to<br/>\nwelcome prospective unschoolers and allay their fears.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But non-test assessment might mean saying &quot;Reads<br/>\n&gt; better, visited twelve  <br/>\n&gt; interesting places and six museums, built a castle<br/>\n&gt; out of gingerbread. . .   <br/>\n&gt; whatever all.  Might be less than that.  Might<br/>\n&gt; involve hiring someone  to meet with <br/>\n&gt; him a while and note that he seems fine for his age.<br/>\n&gt;  Ask  unschoolers where <br/>\n&gt; you are, though, instead of assuming what tests are <br/>\n&gt; like.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote> It might mean all of those things...that is why I was<br/>\nhoping to hear from someone who had taken the various<br/>\ntypes of mandatory tests so I could know what to<br/>\nexpect beforehand, not after.  And again, I based my<br/>\nassumptions on the info I had already been given.  And<br/>\nthen lest I was steered wrong, I inquired further on<br/>\nthis friendly list. :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=- If your child refuses to learn<br/>\n&gt; math, history, science, etc. and  those are the<br/>\n&gt; things<br/>\n&gt; the test covers how will he fare? -=-<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Refuses to learn&quot; can&#39;t happen with unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; When learning is fun and natural, kids learn without<br/>\n&gt; thinking about  it.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n </span></blockquote> Well give me time..remember I am new at this as we<br/>\nall were once upon a time but I have yet to find a way<br/>\nto have him &quot;learn&quot; math in a fun way he will go for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If parents refuse to learn how unschooling works,<br/>\n&gt; though, homeschooling can  <br/>\n&gt; be so frustrating for the whole family that a child<br/>\n&gt; ends up back in  school.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote> Well again, that is why I am availing myself of this<br/>\nwonderful list, so that I might learn more about it<br/>\nbeyond what I have heard shared with me and the books<br/>\nread on the subject.

Do unschoolers feel that it is the<br/>\nonly way to homeschool successfully?  Or that it is<br/>\nthe best, right way to go about it?  Or like<br/>\neverything I have heard thusfar, there are many ways<br/>\nto go about homeschooling and unschooling is just one<br/>\nof them?

My name is Robin and I began<br/>\nhomeschooling my 9yr. old son in early November.  He<br/>\nhad a very difficult time learning anything in public<br/>\nschool; at least it seemed that way to his father and<br/>\nI.  His school days all became about his &quot;lack of<br/>\nperformance&quot; and his &quot;unsatisfactory behavior issues&quot;<br/>\ndue to his diagnosis of ADHD.  All of his teachers<br/>\nhave always said that he is a &quot;very intelligent child<br/>\nwho just seems to refuse to learn!&quot;  Urggghhh!  We<br/>\nwere spending so much time at night helping him learn<br/>\nwhat he didnt in school and he excelled at home in the<br/>\nvery areas the school said he was far behind in that I<br/>\nbegan to feel I could do a way better job than the<br/>\nschool had done thusfar.  And I would enjoy it too. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, after having read book after book on the<br/>\nsubject of homseschooling I finally decided that we<br/>\nwould probably end up taking an eclectic approach to<br/>\nhomeschooling, leaning more predominantly towards<br/>\nunschooling.  Since I have joined this unschooling<br/>\ndiscussion list however, I find that I really knew<br/>\nvery little about what unschooling really is; what it<br/>\nreally looks like.  I am still trying to find my way<br/>\nand decide if unschooling, as I see it here portrayed,<br/>\nis going to be the way to go for us.  I still have<br/>\nmuch to learn.  Right now my son has an aversion to<br/>\nanything that might come close to &quot;education&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;school&quot;, and &quot;learning&quot;.  I have tried to just relax<br/>\nwith him and get him relaxed.  I am trying to help him<br/>\nappreciate that he learns all the time everyday.  Im<br/>\nnot sure how long a time the deschooling process takes<br/>\nand wonder about that too. (I know it probably differs<br/>\nfrom child to child) I have been taking him on field<br/>\ntrips, reading alot with him which he loves and<br/>\nletting him just be.  He prefers to sleep in until<br/>\n11am or so, play video games, read and complain alot<br/>\nabout how bored he is. :)  <br/>\n<br/>\n My question is this:  The state of Washington has a<br/>\nrelatively lenient policy on homeschooling, however<br/>\nthey do require an annual non-test assessment or<br/>\nstandardized test.  Since these tests are, im<br/>\nassuming, going to be covering the 11 subject area<br/>\nrequirements Wa. insists you cover each year, how does<br/>\nyour child ever pass, for lack of a better word, if he<br/>\nis being unschooled?  If your child refuses to learn<br/>\nmath, history, science, etc. and those are the things<br/>\nthe test covers how will he fare?  Is he going to feel<br/>\nlike a failure because he knew very little to nothing<br/>\ncovered in the test?  Tests were about the hardest<br/>\nthing for my son; he always came home feeling hopeless<br/>\nand stupid because he would freeze up and either not<br/>\nfinish in time or feel he had done very poorly.

I am asking these things because I<br/>\nsincerely want to know, want to understand, and want<br/>\nthe best for my son, like all of us here.   <br/>\n<br/>\n Through the parent qualifying course I had to take<br/>\nand all of my reading it has always been stressed that<br/>\nthere is no one right way to homeschool; you just have<br/>\nto find the one that most comfortably fits your family<br/>\nstyle and beliefs.  So I am trying to determine if<br/>\nunschooling is the way for my family to go.  Like I<br/>\nsaid, I have so much to learn. While I like most of<br/>\nwhat I have heard about unschooling, the issue of the<br/>\nyearly test just stumps me.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thank you very much for any responses and help.<br/>\n<br/>\n Sincerely, Robin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nThe all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://my.yahoo.com\">http://my.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6528,"nextTopicId":103071}}
