The physical act of writing was almost painful for<br/>\nher. She could read well (finally, she read late, but when she did, she took<br/>\noff), we were using curriculum and she could do all the work orally. She<br/>\ncould articulate and verbalize wonderful stories, but she could not get them<br/>\ndown on paper. I was concerned as she was about 10 and consulted a few<br/>\n&quot;experts&quot;.  I was actually told by the experts to not worry. Since she could<br/>\ntype, they said let her go with that. They felt that with the world the way<br/>\nit is, that the &#39;need to write&#39; did not exist and wasn&#39;t worth the stress. I<br/>\nwas pretty surprised by this at the time. There was some kind of name for<br/>\nnot being able to write.....then, the following year I learned that my<br/>\nfather-in-law never wrote and still doesn&#39;t. He is 70 years old, has<br/>\nmultiple master degrees and has owned his own successful business for 30<br/>\nsome years. And he does not and will not write anything beyond signing his<br/>\nname. Never has. He hires someone to do his writing if it&#39;s needed. He<br/>\nmanaged very well even before the days electronic communication. That helped<br/>\nme a great deal in relaxing and getting perspective.  Once I relaxed and<br/>\nstopped &quot;making&quot; Kate write, she stopped all of it. Didn&#39;t write, type or<br/>\nanything for a while. Then suddenly at about 12 or 13 she started typing her<br/>\nideas and stories....volumes of them. At about 14 she picked up a pencil<br/>\nagain. She writes all the time. She still prefers typing to writing (as do<br/>\nI).  So much of what people worry about just doesn&#39;t really matter in the<br/>\nlong run of life.
