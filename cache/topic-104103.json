It is for a memorial service for <br/>\nmy recently deceased brother in law, hubby&#39;s bro. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I am going to take a cue from you: no discussion of education at <br/>\nall. If and when it happens (not if, I reckon) we will prepare to <br/>\nleave. As it is, we&#39;ll only be there for about 24 hours. <br/>\n<br/>\nwishing for the courage of my convictions, yet getting closer to that <br/>\nideal all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Cancel the visit.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Seriously.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Or keep as many hours of it as possible in public places, not at <br/>\nher  house.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Or tell her you considered cancelling the visit, but you&#39;re willing <br/>\nto come  <br/>\n&gt; on the condition that she not discuss anything about education with <br/>\nyou or the <br/>\n&gt;  children at all.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Those are my first thoughts.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Need some reading material","postDate":"1109874725","msgId":104105,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyNi41N2Y0ODY0MS4yZjU4YjIyNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":104103,"nextInTopic":104116,"prevInTime":104104,"nextInTime":104106,"topicId":104103,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Cancel the visit.
