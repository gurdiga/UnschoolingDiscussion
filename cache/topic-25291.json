I used <br/>\nto belong to this list ayear or so ago, but insubscribed because I became too <br/>\nbusy for all the email! I have a little more time for it now, and I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink I could have rejoined at a better time ,as you guys are talking about <br/>\nso many issues that are relevant to me!<br/>\n<br/>\n1. My son Gary (7) is an only child.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I have unschooled from the beginning, but this year I had been starting to <br/>\ndoubt I guess. Our state (KS) is one of the easiest to homeschool in, there <br/>\nare NO reporting requirements, but I had been obsessing lately about <br/>\ndocumentation. I asked myself , what would happen if he HAD to go to public <br/>\nschool, (for instance , if somehting happened to me) and I was looking into <br/>\nthings like Clonlara, where he would get &quot;transcripts&quot; Thankfully , I got <br/>\nback on this list , before I blew alot of money! You guys reminded me of my <br/>\nwhole philosophy for doing this, and I had to question my motives. I KNOW my <br/>\nson learns on his own, he has blown my mind on more than one occasion! Thanks <br/>\nfor restoring my faith,( and sanity!)<br/>\n<br/>\n3.I&#39;m another one of those &quot;alternatives&quot; being bi-poly and pagan.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. I think the &quot;bickering&quot;, or &quot;discussing &quot; or whatever you choose to call <br/>\nit that goes on here, is actually pretty informative and often even <br/>\nentertaining! It does make for a HUGE amount of email, but it&#39;s alot better <br/>\nthan some of the other dead lists I&#39;m on where 100+ members can&#39;t manage to <br/>\npost more than once a month!<br/>\n<br/>\n5. I too have had bouts with illness and have worried about the amount of <br/>\nenergy I was able to give to my son. I would love to hear more about how <br/>\nhandle this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell enough from me for now. It&#39;s good to be back!<br/>\n<br/>\nTrisha<br/>\n&quot;Anything less than love is not knowledge. It is opinion or belief, and it is <br/>\nalways mistaken.&quot;<br/>\nPolly Berrien Berends</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25114,"nextTopicId":25158}}
