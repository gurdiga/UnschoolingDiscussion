I <br/>\nrecently read &quot;The Other Parent&quot;, also about the harm of media on children.  <br/>\nWhile I&#39;m not convinced about the argument and tend to let the kids decide <br/>\nwhat to watch when, I found the book interesting.  Newsweek seemed to focus <br/>\nmore on whether or not tv can be educational.  The Other Parent spoke to the <br/>\nviolence, sexuality and commercialism of media.  I can&#39;t remember the stats <br/>\non how much the average kid watches, but if you couple that with mind numbing <br/>\nschool for however many hours I day, I can see why it would be too much.  :)  <br/>\nI&#39;d recommend the book for another view if you have the time to read it - got <br/>\nmine from the library.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49363,"nextTopicId":49350}}
