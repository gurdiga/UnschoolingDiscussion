He does read, however, every time we play cards (yu gi oh), plays computer games, video games, the tv channel guide, the signs out and about. He prefers reading lists and things that have meaning for him. Books are read to him, complex, good quality lit. Strewn around the home are garfield comics, Calvin and Hobbs, Star Wars comics, things he is drawn too. Figuring out what yuour son likes to read is a good idea. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. I found a great fun book Games For Reading by Peggy Kaye. I also have an almost 6 and playing reading games is fun for both. The games are easy, some goofy, some you already play. I would check her book out as a place to add reading games. The games are really fun and strengthen areas which may help your son grasp what he wants too know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109572,"nextTopicId":109593}}
