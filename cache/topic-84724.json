Someone <br/>\nis murdered. In algebra, you have some sort of &quot;situation&quot; that needs <br/>\nto be figured out. By &quot;situation&quot; I don&#39;t mean &quot;solve for X&quot; or <br/>\nanything like that - I mean there is a REAL problem, something you can <br/>\ndescribe in words.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvidence is gathered and processed and connections made and some <br/>\npossibilities eliminated and some expanded upon. In algebra, this is <br/>\nthe process of figuring out what information is available, what is <br/>\nrelevant to use, what can be discarded, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the evidence has to work together. In algebra this is the <br/>\nequivalent of writing an equation or system of equations knowing they <br/>\nall have to be true.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe detectives work to figure out how all the evidence fits together. <br/>\nThey determine what it &quot;tells&quot; them - are there some suspects who can <br/>\nbe entirely ruled out? Can they narrow it down to just one? Is there <br/>\none more piece of information that would be critical in solving the <br/>\ncrime? In algebra, this is the stage of &quot;solving the equations.&quot; In <br/>\nbeginning algebra, this means &quot;solving for X&quot; - the answer narrows down <br/>\nto just one number. Simple, open and shut case and the &quot;detective&quot; <br/>\nknows who to arrest for the crime. In more complicated situations, <br/>\nsolving the equation might lead to two possible suspects being equally <br/>\nlikely. In algebra, this kind of situation gets described with certain <br/>\nkinds of equations - quadratic equations are one kind that gives you <br/>\ntwo possible solutions, for example. Really complicated situations <br/>\nmight never even be solved. Maybe some suspects are eliminated, but no <br/>\nfinal culprit can be nailed for the crime. In algebra, we sometimes can <br/>\nsay only something like &quot;the solution is a number greater than zero,&quot; <br/>\nor some other description that doesn&#39;t &quot;nail&quot; the anwer, but gives us <br/>\nsome information about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the detective has used his skills to determine who the perpetrator <br/>\nis, decision has to be made as to what to DO with that information. <br/>\nWhat crime should he be charged with? How should the evidence be <br/>\npresented to a jury? What sentence should be sought. In algebra, <br/>\nfinding the value of X is never the purpose. The purpose was to get <br/>\ninformation to help us figure out that situation we started with, <br/>\nremember? So, if you determined that the value of X must be greater <br/>\nthan zero or that X=15 or whatever the solution to the equation was, <br/>\nyou still have to figure out how that information helps you solve YOUR <br/>\nmystery and what to do about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school, they do a VERY poor job of putting algebra into any kind of <br/>\ncontext at all. A textbook might try to describe uses for algebra in <br/>\nits opening chapter, but it quickly resorts to teaching all about how <br/>\nto manipulate equations and find values for variables that mean nothing <br/>\nbecause they are not grounded in an actual problem, mystery, situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: sorta math question - Part 2","postDate":"1068920453","msgId":84841,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5OS4yMjgzNTljNS4yY2U3Yzg4NUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":84828,"nextInTopic":84845,"prevInTime":84840,"nextInTime":84842,"topicId":84724,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/14/03 6:53:15 PM, zenmomma@hotmail.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-860341573\">In a message dated 11/14/03 6:53:15 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zenmomma@...\">zenmomma@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I also explained what &quot;word problems&quot; are in school and how most kids <br/>\n<br/>\nhate them.

This little girl goes to a Core Knowlege school and <br/>\nCasey sometimes helps her with her homework. &lt;g&gt; Casey mostly does <br/>\nthis to have more time to spend with her friend since she has <br/>\nhomework every night.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it turns out that this kid has been giving Casey some grief about <br/>\nmath, telling her she doesn&#39;t know ANY math since she&#39;s not familiar <br/>\nwith school-type problems. I&#39;ve coached Casey on this and pointed out <br/>\nto her when she&#39;s doing some similar level problems in her head. She <br/>\nsays she understands that she knows the language of numbers and how <br/>\nto work with them, but she hasn&#39;t been able to explain it to her <br/>\nfriend in a way the friend will accept.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not a new problem, I know. It&#39;s just hard to hear my bright, <br/>\namazing child tell me she doesn&#39;t &quot;know math&quot; with a dejected look on <br/>\nher face. I thought maybe she was asking for a little school math, <br/>\nbut that doesn&#39;t seem to be it. She just wants her friend to not <br/>\nthink she&#39;s dumb, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny thing is, we were in Burger King the other day and Casey was <br/>\nable to tell me, in a split second, that 2 $.99 toys would cost <br/>\n$1.98. I took that opportunity to show her that she had just done <br/>\nwhat the schools call double digit addition with decimals and <br/>\ncarrying. I wrote it out on a napkin and then she explained how she <br/>\ngot the answer in her head. She thought the paper way took to long. I <br/>\nagreed, but also showed her sets of numbers that might be easier to <br/>\nadd on paper. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe was interested, so we also went on to multiplication. She <br/>\ncompletely got that it&#39;s a shortcut to adding. The other day we had a <br/>\nsimilar experience with subtraction and division. So this kid gets <br/>\nnumbers. I KNOW that.
