What if<br/>\nthis child does not want to go consistently? Do we let them skip lessons<br/>\nor do we<br/>\n&quot;require&quot; that they meet this obligation of theirs?)<br/>\nJosefa,<br/>\nthat question has arisen in my household.  My husband thinks because the<br/>\nbuck stops here, with him, that my son has no say in how he wrestles. <br/>\nBut I say, talk with the child and come to a solution.  Find out why he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to go and go from there.  I talked with my son and found out<br/>\nit was the matches that were boring him, not the mat club.  The matches<br/>\nwere against an opponent who was either far superior or far inferior, so<br/>\nhe felt they taught him nothing.  So, we (he and I) came to an agreement<br/>\nthat he would go to mat club, but pick and choose which matches to attend<br/>\nand let us know a week ahead of time.  But my husband said, because of my<br/>\nson&#39;s irresponsible behavior by calling it off at the last minute that<br/>\njust proves he is just a kid and that it is Dad&#39;s job to decide for him. <br/>\nI was miffed at this and the next day my husband got an earful of what I<br/>\nthought of his listening skills.  So far, my son still goes and the<br/>\nsubject hasn&#39;t been brought up again, since my son decided to go along to<br/>\nget along:(<br/>\nBonni<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32803,"nextTopicId":32518}}
