How so? The <br/>\nauthor, Kathy Hirsch Pasek, was my Psychology instructor a long time <br/>\nago and is now a friend and role model of mine.  I used to babysit <br/>\nher kids even, and they are all great boys. (Her oldest son used to <br/>\nlove the weather channel I remember). She is so enthusiastic, <br/>\nenergetic, and excited about learning (she even made statistics fun) <br/>\nbut not pushy or competitive (her kids went/go to a laid back Quaker <br/>\nprivate school).  Kathy also has put out some tapes under the <br/>\nlabel &quot;KaMotion&quot; which address kid-friendly topics like &quot;Which <br/>\nelevator will it be&quot; and &quot;100 ways to keep from going to bed&quot;.  I am <br/>\nlooking forward to getting the book soon (I live in Israel).  She <br/>\nalso has several other books about language development.  (BTW, her <br/>\nsecret to career success and involved parenting is full time <br/>\nhousehold help--she has taught me that one woman cannot &quot;do it all&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nBuy the book!
