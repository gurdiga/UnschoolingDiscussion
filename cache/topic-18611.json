So I put that energy into controlling my children&#39;s freedom <br/>\nfrom other people&#39;s controls. &lt;g&gt;  I put the organization into organizing <br/>\nopportunities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLocal homeschoolers are doing field trips (lots of them) lately for the <br/>\nyounger kids.  My youngest is the age of their oldest, pretty much, at nine.  <br/>\nMy older boys have stuff going (gaming geek stuff, mostly, but not <br/>\nexclusively) with other boys--mostly homeschooled.  Our house is the #2 <br/>\nhangout.  #1 is the gaming shop a mile up the road.  We have enough sleepling <br/>\nspace and bedding and are conveniently located that sometimes there are three <br/>\nor four extra kids here, and not just on weekends.  So my primary job lately <br/>\nhas been being transport and supervision for that group.  I try to provide <br/>\ntable space for gaming, make sure there&#39;s milk (luxury days:  soda) and <br/>\njuice, reassure parents who need the okay that it&#39;s fine for the kids to be <br/>\nhere two or three days straight without them reciprocating (some can&#39;t, and <br/>\nit wouldn&#39;t be the same--one family lives 50 miles out in the country which <br/>\ndefeats the purpose).  I occasionally expose them to a movie they wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave seen or a comedian or some music, subtle-like.  I spell words when they <br/>\nneed spelling (sometimes two computers are on both phone lines late at night) <br/>\nand otherwise provide physical-plant support.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;results&quot; or &quot;product&quot; aren&#39;t &quot;legitimate.&quot;  I&#39;m babysitting is all.
