I went and joined Shine with unschooling and <br/>\nplan to lurk for a while. It is wonderful to know there are others <br/>\nin my same situation that I can learn from. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean leaving him to himself all day.  <br/>\nUnschooling<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; has never meant that&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Im sorry I worded that in a bad way. Now that I reread it I feel <br/>\nlike maybe I gave the impression that I had a sort of go do whatever <br/>\nas long as your get out of my hair attitude. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I should explain more and say that I dont know what his <br/>\nintrests are. He cant talk .. Ive been trying to teach him new signs <br/>\nbut he has learned eat and drink and more and thats all he is <br/>\ninterested in thank you :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIts kind of ironic. All the &quot;professionals&quot; worked hard to convince <br/>\nme that school was the best place for him. One of the things that <br/>\nwas sure to get better were his communication . <br/>\nBefore he started school he didnt have to tell me what he wanted i <br/>\njust knew. Now that communication is almost gone. I dont know for <br/>\nsure if its because he is seperated from me 3 hours a day or just <br/>\nbecause he is getting older.<br/>\n<br/>\nNicole <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wifetovegman2002&quot; <br/>\n&lt;wifetovegman2002@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Nicole Willoughby<br/>\n&gt; &lt;cncnawilloughby@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If he is left to himself he will spend the entire day chewing on <br/>\n </span></blockquote>his<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sock, possibly watching a video and running around the house<br/>\n&gt; aimlessly.
