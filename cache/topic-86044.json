No more weird than those men who spend every weekend polishing<br/>\na car.<br/>\nMy bike is my freedom to roam. I loathe driving (and now don&#39;t have a<br/>\ncar anyway) and walking is hard because of MS. My bike means I can<br/>\nhead for the supermarket on a Saturday - its 8 miles - and have a few<br/>\nhours of alone time and explore the area too. I always end up with<br/>\nabout 50 pounds of groceries strapped to the rear rack so I&#39;m not fast<br/>\non the way back. I stop for a chocolate cappacino. Everything I need<br/>\nis on my bicycle. Bliss.<br/>\nBut next week it has to go on a ship so I&#39;ll be stuck with buses for 4<br/>\nweeks until our stuff arrives :-(<br/>\nAnd then it will be a couple of weeeks before the baby is due.<br/>\nsniff sniff<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley the cycling hippo</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] was Extreme Behavior- Now -  Precious Bikes..","postDate":"1071108784","msgId":86050,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwMzEyMTAxODEyMDYuMDI1YzRlYzBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE5Ny4yMzZhNThmMy4yZDA4YmJhY0Bhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE5Ny4yMzZhNThmMy4yZDA4YmJhY0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":86044,"nextInTopic":86076,"prevInTime":86049,"nextInTime":86051,"topicId":86044,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
