What a thrill to meet such awsome people.<br/>\nMy dh Bob and I totally love Kelly and Ben Lovejoy.  Talk about great <br/>\npeople!<br/>\nThe speakers were so wonderful.  I was on the verge of tears <br/>\nlistening to Anne and Mary and Pam.  They talked of things that <br/>\ntouched me deeply.  Sandra had me laughing and just generally feeling <br/>\nreally good and calm.  <br/>\nBob, my dh was hanging out with a bunch of women, late into the night <br/>\nthe first night there, providing accompaniment with his guitar to <br/>\ntheir wonderful harmonies.  I missed that, but he had a blast.<br/>\nHe won the privledge (they pushed him into it) of being the grand <br/>\nfinale at the talent show, which he ended by singing the song <br/>\nto &quot;Sponge Bob Square Pants&quot;.  It was great.  He started with &quot;Are <br/>\nyou ready kids?&quot; and they all yelled &quot;Aye Aye captain&quot; without him <br/>\neven telling them what he was going to sing.<br/>\nMy little ones Jack and Jamie (6 and 4) had so much fun playing with <br/>\nall the other little ones.  My older one Carly(13 soon) had a great <br/>\ntime doing all the cool funshops and meeting some really cool kids.<br/>\nI brought pictures of my ds Sam and got to share him with a few <br/>\npeople.  I felt really sad that he didn&#39;t get to experience such a <br/>\ngreat event.  He would have loved it.  I probably would have only <br/>\nseen him fleetingly there.  I could just imagine him running by with <br/>\na group of kids, hanging out at the video games area, swimming and <br/>\nhaving an all around blast and coming to me for quick needs here and <br/>\nthere.  <br/>\nMy dh was actually reading HEM on the way home!  I couldn&#39;t believe <br/>\nit!<br/>\nHe was one of the dads there that were helping the newbie dads to get <br/>\nover their fears and doubts.  He told me some of the things he said <br/>\nand I was blown away!  He has never been in the position to have to <br/>\ngo really deep into describing what we do, and when he did, he came <br/>\nto some realizations of his own.  Mostly that he really does trust <br/>\nour kids and knows they are intelligent, fascinating people.  He <br/>\nlearned a lot listen to Ben talk about Rule vs. Principles.<br/>\nBen had a &quot;dad&#39;s meeting&quot; the first day there and that really set the <br/>\nstage for some good male bonding.  They were sworn to secrecy and <br/>\nwere very tight lipped coming out of it.  Ben&#39;s a really smart guy.<br/>\nHe held the meeting in the hotel lounge and mentioned &quot;beer&quot; to <br/>\nentice them down there.  It might have been coincidence that it was <br/>\nhappy hour too. ;-)<br/>\nWe&#39;re already looking forward to going to next years conference in <br/>\nNew England.<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":65837075,"authorName":"Shannon","from":"&quot;Shannon&quot; &lt;davenshan@...&gt;","profile":"shan_who","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-Discussion] SOS CONFERENCE SC","postDate":"1061821223","msgId":79171,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEhFRUVKSFBHQ0tQRkdQTUVMTk9ETUVCUERMQUEuZGF2ZW5zaGFuQG1pbmRzcHJpbmcuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJpYnMwditsaXAxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":79169,"nextInTopic":79189,"prevInTime":79170,"nextInTime":79172,"topicId":79169,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"HERE HERE!!!!
