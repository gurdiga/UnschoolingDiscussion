For example, my 8-year-old son is playing 007<br/>\n&gt; Golden Eye on the Nintendo and my husband mentioned that we should<br/>\n&gt; really watch the movie because he would enjoy the action. But he (my<br/>\n&gt; husband) completely forgot about the women and how James &quot;uses&quot; them<br/>\n&gt; - or they use each other? Anyway, how would ya&#39;ll handle this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Afair, Goldeneye&#39;s better than the others about this...  much better<br/>\nthan any of the Roger Moore ones anyway!  but still I know what <br/>\nyou<br/>\nmean...  I really don&#39;t know...  I find this very tricky cos I was<br/>\nextremely sensitive to sexual stuff (even just snogging) on the telly<br/>\nwhen I was little, in fact so much so that if i&#39;d been referred to a<br/>\nchild-psych which the school asked my mum to do when I was 6 or <br/>\n7, I<br/>\nthink they could have thought I had been abused...  but I have no<br/>\nmemory of ever being sexually abused...  just &#39;aware&#39; from a very<br/>\nyoung age...  I also became active relatively early...  I don&#39;t know,<br/>\nI think it&#39;s one of those individual things again.  Now the image of<br/>\nwomen protrayed is a whole other issue, and I don&#39;t have boys so I<br/>\nreally don&#39;t know about that...<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\n------- End of forwarded message -------</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19073,"nextTopicId":18984}}
