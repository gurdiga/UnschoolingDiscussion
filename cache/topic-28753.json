When I first started exploring<br/>\nunschooling and  found this list...and tried to contribute in my own way.<br/>\nWell,  every time my hot buttons get pushed...I&#39;ve been challenged to open<br/>\nmy mind and think it through to a deeper level.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople get complacent.....several people on this list (including,  but not<br/>\nlimited to Sandra) have the ability to knock people out of their<br/>\ncomplacency.  Just when you think you&#39;ve got the parenting,  unschooling<br/>\n&#39;thing&#39; down pat....it gets pointed out that maybe you DON&#39;T...there&#39;s more<br/>\ngrowth to come.  Most people who are products of the school system have<br/>\nthought patterns about learning deeply ingrained into them....even if you<br/>\nWANT to be different,  it takes a lot of effort to prevent falling into old<br/>\npatterns.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I can&#39;t speak for anyone else,  but where I&#39;m living,  I only know of<br/>\none other unschooling family,  and our paths rarely cross since our<br/>\nchildren&#39;s ages and interests rarely cross.  So I&#39;m surrounded by those who<br/>\nthink differently than I.   I tend to keep the peace most of the time<br/>\n(although less and less as I clarify my reasoning)......I hope to be a<br/>\nperson who can &quot;wake others up&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; At 3:51 PM -0500 11/27/01, Sarah Carothers wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve been &#39;around&#39; these boards since the old HEM days... about 9<br/>\n&gt; &gt;years or so????... not that I think that matters but since you were<br/>\n&gt; &gt;pointing out how long you&#39;ve been reading Sandra&#39;s posts, I thought<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I should do the same. Back in the old days, every single time I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;posted something, she was lying in wait to ambush my posts. It<br/>\n&gt; &gt;didn&#39;t take long for me to go into silent mode and just watch the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fur fly with someone else. She&#39;s been bickering for quite a long<br/>\n&gt; &gt;time. That&#39;s not to say she&#39;s not had some very informative advice<br/>\n&gt; &gt;or information... just that the tone has always been this way with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sandra.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have to support what Sarah writes here. Over the years Sandra and I<br/>\n&gt; have had our differences, too. Long-time HEM readers will know this<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t the first time she&#39;s been an HEM columnist...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just FWIW. Water under the bridge. But perhaps it contributes perspective.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Helen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28535,"nextTopicId":28759}}
