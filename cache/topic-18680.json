Sometimes, I myself <br/>\nwonder if I&#39;m coming across that way.  We all have things we feel strongly <br/>\nabout and believe in passionately, whether they be unschooling, the <br/>\nenvironment, keeping a positive tone, attachment parenting, etc....I always <br/>\nfind that it is hard to find the right balance between being serene, loving, <br/>\npeaceful, etc. and having the courage of my convictions, standing up for what <br/>\nI believe is right, and so on.<br/>\n     I don&#39;t know if you will be familiar with these two women, especially <br/>\nthe second, but a major part of me wants to be like Marmie in Little Women <br/>\nand another part of me wants to be like Joan Baez, the 60s (and onward) folk <br/>\nprotest singer who marched with Martin Luther King and has spoken out very <br/>\nstrongly on her beliefs.  I try to figure out what it means to be tolerant of <br/>\nother views and how far that goes and how to balance that with honesty and <br/>\ncourage.  To me, it isn&#39;t at all easy and I am always looking for better ways <br/>\nfor myself.<br/>\n     It is true that debates often become too sarcastic and angry.  I think <br/>\nthe only way to try to keep this from happening is to keep reminding <br/>\nourselves that the other person&#39;s motive is most likely good and that we <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to personally wound them, even as we debate the subject at hand <br/>\nvigorously if we are so inclined.<br/>\n     Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this, Laura....<br/>\n<br/>\n      Lucy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"parrishml@aol.com","from":"parrishml@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"QcU8AtjK7eySsb-cmZofZ3YQe2nNS5I9ZYYtlfzlXiyYeNoPJmkARskRgbhgSxF8DpWWsDeJjXM","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] doom and gloom--cessation, and plea for critical thi...","postDate":"987364752","msgId":18687,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRkLmE2MWUwOGMuMjgwYjU3OTBAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":18680,"nextInTopic":18695,"prevInTime":18686,"nextInTime":18688,"topicId":18680,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/15/2001 2:53:39 PM Eastern Daylight Time, LASaliger@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1663822370\">In a message dated 4/15/2001 2:53:39 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LASaliger@...\">LASaliger@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  As much as we may <br/>\n disagree with someone on an issue, I think it is wrong to make statements <br/>\n about her/him as a person, as in &quot;You must be really insecure, selfish, <br/>\n ignorant, negative, etc....&quot;  I believe it is better to presume that the <br/>\n person has a good motive just as we want that same presumption made about us <br/>\n when we speak up about our beliefs.  <br/>\n <br/>\n          Lucy &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with what you write here, Lucy, but -- and this has been my sticking <br/>\npoint in these debate/discussions before -- the TONE can be unfriendly, <br/>\nsupercilious, condescending, sarcastic -- without ever actually stooping to <br/>\npersonal attacks, although those occur as well.
