It&#39;s been my experience that this is not <br/>\nreally the case. Was it here I read recently that out of a class of 30, 10 get it, <br/>\n10 don&#39;t care so they teach to the other 10 in the middle who might care but <br/>\ndon&#39;t get it. I seriously doubt that those 10 always get it either. So say <br/>\nmaybe, and I think this is a high guess that 15 out of 30 get what is being <br/>\ntaught at any given time. The 10 that don&#39;t care have turned it all off so they <br/>\naren&#39;t getting anything. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe school kids I knew/know turn school off at about 3pm, except for homework <br/>\n(if they do it and a lot don&#39;t) they don&#39;t even want to hear anything <br/>\neducational.  I think I&#39;m rambling here but in short I am trying to say that you <br/>\ncould send a kid to school and he could go clear through and not get an education, <br/>\nmany do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I guess you could do drill and kill at home too but as you probably <br/>\nalready know that is not much fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s amazing what people can do when they are motivated by a goal <br/>\nthey set. I think a good base of real life experience will take them much further <br/>\nthan 4 years of higher math. I think the connections happen much faster as <br/>\nthey are learning because they can remember where in life these things applied. <br/>\nI remember not too long ago one of my older boys coming to me after starting a <br/>\nnew job and asking me if I could help him figure out the tape measurer. He <br/>\nwas working in a construction type job and really needed to know this. He had <br/>\nalways had a bad math phobia in school which hurt his self esteem a lot. We <br/>\nspent about 20 minutes going over measurement and he stepped back amazed. He told <br/>\nme that this was really easy but that in school this was all in a book and he <br/>\nalways ended up so confused. He never had another problem.
