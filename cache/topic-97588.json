I too would like to be straight forward with people <br/>\nabout how my children learn, so that they can learn how natural and <br/>\njoyful it can be.<br/>\n <br/>\nAt my children&#39;s evaluations this year, we just brought the <br/>\naccordion folder full of things we had collected throughout the year <br/>\nand a book list. The evaluator knows us from being in the same group <br/>\nactivities, but I haven&#39;t ever announced, &quot;We unschool&quot;. I have <br/>\nanswered questions about curriculum with, &quot;We don&#39;t use any. We just <br/>\nfollow whatever their interests are.&quot; Anyway, she was able to see <br/>\nthe progress, but I really like the idea of a narrative to tie it <br/>\nall together. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt my 13yo son&#39;s eval. last year, he was surprised by what he had <br/>\ndone throughout the year too. He was only looking at the things we <br/>\nhad saved: drawings, pictures, ticket stubs, directions for <br/>\nexperiments, recipes, etc. This year he decided to take a <br/>\nstandardized test, to assure himself he was learning. If I could <br/>\nverbalize, or keep a narrative record to show him, maybe he wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave those doubts. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wouldn&#39;t mind, I would love to see any/all of the narratives <br/>\nyou wrote to give me some inspiration. You could e-mail them to me <br/>\nprivately. Thanks again for sharing!<br/>\n<br/>\nDeanne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97333,"nextTopicId":97589}}
