She will take some portion of conversation, morph it in<br/>\nher head, and come out believing (and saying) something that never happened.<br/>\n(I don&#39;t have any idea what causes her to do this: habit, upbringing,<br/>\npsychology, beats me).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most recent examples:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Sil telling my husband (her brother) that on her next visit she&#39;ll be<br/>\nready to review our daughters&#39; homeschooling for us. My husband replied to<br/>\nthis something along the lines of, &quot;Huh?&quot; She repeated that, as they had<br/>\nagreed, she would look over the girls progress and help us sort out any<br/>\nproblems. Wally assured her he had no memory of this agreement, and would<br/>\nnever ask anyone at all under any circumstances to do this. Sil became very<br/>\nindignant.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Sil telling my other sister-in-law, Heidi, &quot;remember when Judi told me to<br/>\n&#39;just get over it&#39; about Mom dying!&quot;  Judi is their step-mother, a very kind<br/>\nwoman with a good relationship with all four of her daughters (natural and<br/>\nstep), and this confused Heidi who had no memory of such a conversation, but<br/>\nSil insisted it was true.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter sorting through both situations, we did figure out what had happened:<br/>\n<br/>\nWally was trying to explain homeschooling to Sil (a chemistry major, who is<br/>\nabout to get her PhD), using as an example that if our daughters ever got<br/>\nthe chemist&#39;s bug and went beyond what we knew to do or could figure out, we<br/>\nknew who to call for advice and help, namely Sil.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, in a conversation about how difficult it would be for Sil to marry next<br/>\nspring without her mother at the wedding, Judi (step-mother) had said<br/>\nsomething in an attempt to comfort along the lines that it WAS very hard,<br/>\nbut she knew that Sil&#39;s mother would really want her to have a happy life<br/>\nand that she, Sil, shouldn&#39;t feel guilty about being happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome recent conversations on this list are reminding me a lot of trying to<br/>\ntalk to my sister-in-law. The trouble is, she believes what she says, and no<br/>\nmatter who or how many say, &quot;you said this&quot; she says, &quot;No, I said that.&quot; It<br/>\nmakes for excruciating conversations with a person who is otherwise quite<br/>\npleasant to be around. And it is pointless to argue, as she really does seem<br/>\nto think she&#39;s got the right of it and all the rest of the world is<br/>\npersecuting her for reasons unknown.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only bright spot is that everyone around her figures it out pretty<br/>\nquickly, and makes allowances for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24794,"nextTopicId":24801}}
