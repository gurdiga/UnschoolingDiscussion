As much as I enjoy and learn from every<br/>\n&gt; digest on this list I<br/>\n&gt; still felt a need to add this note.  I am a dark skinned<br/>\n&gt; Costa Rican with 7 sisters and brothers and my hubby one of<br/>\n&gt; three and is from Northern Italian.  Every time I read a<br/>\n&gt; post about Irish or Italian families<br/>\n&gt; yelling or Spanish/Mexican families having bad tempers I<br/>\n&gt; cringe.  It reminds me of<br/>\n&gt; nasty comments made by teachers when I was little about<br/>\n&gt; Mexicans being lazy<br/>\n&gt; or assumptions by highschool boys about Spanish girls.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do not believe that any person on this list wrote with<br/>\n&gt; malicious intent but I do<br/>\n&gt; believe that these kinds of generalizations hurt and<br/>\n&gt; cripple.  My parents were both<br/>\n&gt; abusers.  Physically, emotionally.  Growing up in my house<br/>\n&gt; was akin to growing up in<br/>\n&gt; a battlefield.  My father was vicious and my mother<br/>\n&gt; mentally unstable.  I never knew<br/>\n&gt; what would set her off, every day, every night was a trip<br/>\n&gt; through the minefields.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I remember once an aunt of mine happened by just after my<br/>\n&gt; father had punched my 4 year<br/>\n&gt; old brother&#39;s head into a wall (he had spilt milk on the<br/>\n&gt; table).  She sent my uncle into the room to take care of<br/>\n&gt; him while she tended to my black eye and split lip.  I<br/>\n&gt; remember her breath on my face<br/>\n&gt; while she told me it was not his fault, since their father<br/>\n&gt; beat all of them.  I also remember<br/>\n&gt; thinking, no it is his fault.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My father and mother were abusers.  Not because of past<br/>\n&gt; connections or treatment or<br/>\n&gt; even because of being Costa Rican.  They were abusers<br/>\n&gt; period.  My father was a silent striker.<br/>\n&gt; He didn&#39;t yell.  He didn&#39;t raise his voice.  Just his fist.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband has a gentle nature and a soft spoken way.  His<br/>\n&gt; family live in America now and are as different from mine<br/>\n&gt; as night and day.  They are extraordinarrily quiet and<br/>\n&gt; jovial and gentle people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think we need always to remember that people are who they<br/>\n&gt; are because of the choices they make and the environment<br/>\n&gt; they make them in.  I am a very quiet individual, so are<br/>\n&gt; most of my brothers and sisters.  Except for the ones who<br/>\n&gt; are loud.  Because that&#39;s just the way they are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t usually share this much personal info (ever<br/>\n&gt; actually) nor do I usually write long posts.<br/>\n&gt; But I had to write and let folks know that at least one<br/>\n&gt; person has been offended by the use of<br/>\n&gt; these generalizations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; thanks for listening<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
