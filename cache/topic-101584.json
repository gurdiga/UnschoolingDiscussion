Sometimes I feel they&#39;d <br/>\n&gt;be better off on a ps playground then home with siblings.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whenever I think the same thing, I remember that at least *I* am coming <br/>\nfrom a place where I take the whole child into account, the whole <br/>\nchild&#39;s life, when I deal with them. My goals are for life-long peace <br/>\nand joy... the teachers/ps staff don&#39;t have the time or energy to do <br/>\nthat...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I try to breathe.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;At our house, we trust Yoda&quot; -- Hayden, at about age 3 &lt;bg&gt;<br/>\nTrying isn&#39;t doing, if you&#39;re doing, then give yourself credit and say, <br/>\n&quot;I breathe&quot; &quot;I&#39;m gentle and calm&quot; &quot;I give attention&quot; -- you can only DO <br/>\nyour best, whatever that means on any given day in any given situation, <br/>\nno it doesn&#39;t mean being 100% perfect - it means if you have only 37% of <br/>\nyour capacity today, you give all 37%, tomorrow it may be 59% or even 3% <br/>\nbut give what you&#39;ve got. [I love The Four Agreements by Don Miguel <br/>\nRuiz] Though our goal is to have a peaceful family/existence, we can&#39;t <br/>\njust wake up and have that ideal -- we need to journey to get there, by <br/>\ntoday being MORE peaceful than yesterday, an easy and lofty goal. At my <br/>\nhouse, sometimes that means 15 fights instead of yesterday&#39;s 16. [again, <br/>\nadvice I gleaned from the Peaceful Parenting tape]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I say Yes whenever I can.  I try to be gentle and calm.  I try to give everyone <br/>\n&gt;tons of attention.  I&#39;m just stretched too thin.

Big example from my own life: Thanksgiving is the beginning of <br/>\nmy annual grief cycle, culminating around December 3 (dh&#39;s death day <br/>\nanniversary). This year, we&#39;ve got a new guy in our life so I kept quiet <br/>\nabout what I know to be the hardest couple of weeks of the year, <br/>\nconvincing myself I&#39;ll just be able to keep it together. Weeeeellllllll, <br/>\nas you can imagine, a mommy who is barely able to function at dinner is <br/>\nnot a mommy who has /any/ available energy to tend to the needs of her <br/>\nchildren. Hayden was in rare form, agitated, needy, aggressive and <br/>\ncrabby. I was so afraid that I would fall apart if I opened my mouth, I <br/>\nwas NO gentle or calm assurance to my little guy. Anything I did say <br/>\ncame out quickly and angrily. I did end up screeching at them both <br/>\nbefore we went to sleep... the tirade lasted long enough for the entire <br/>\nfacade to be broken, I cried and cried, admitted to being more sad than <br/>\nmad... then told the kids (for the first time, Hannah exclaimed!) <br/>\nstories of their dad and me and why Thanksgiving is so important... A <br/>\nbit ass-backward, I could have avoided the whole ding dang thing by <br/>\nhaving the &quot;it&#39;s important and I&#39;m gonna be sad, so be gentle with me&quot; <br/>\ntalk for the week(s) prior. Luckily, we&#39;re a week into mommy having her <br/>\nhead out of her ass (which is how it feels to climb out from under <br/>\ngrief) and we&#39;re back to being normal -- which doesn&#39;t mean perfect, but <br/>\nthe situations as you described are down to once-every-other-day-ish <br/>\ninstead of several times daily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m at the end of my rope. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tie a knot and swing! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n:) diana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] At the end of my rope","postDate":"1103220293","msgId":101600,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZDRDBDMTNBLTRGOEMtMTFEOS1BMjk3LTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEY2MTZGN0RCLTRGNkQtMTFEOS1BMjFFLTAwMEEyN0UxRTNGMkBhdHRnbG9iYWwubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PEY2MTZGN0RCLTRGNkQtMTFEOS1BMjFFLTAwMEEyN0UxRTNGMkBhdHRnbG9iYWwubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":101599,"nextInTopic":101601,"prevInTime":101599,"nextInTime":101601,"topicId":101584,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Here are some that you and <br/>\nthey might come up with:<br/>\n<br/>\nTake turns - each of us gets a lick, one after the other.<br/>\nGive it to the dog and let him lick the whole thing and WE have <br/>\nsomething else.<br/>\nMom scrape it off into separate bowls or on separate spoons so we each <br/>\nget one.<br/>\nJohnny gets to lick the bowl but &quot;I&quot; get an extra brownie when they&#39;re <br/>\ndone.<br/>\nWe go to the store and get more brownie mix and we don&#39;t cook them, we <br/>\nJUST eat the batter.<br/>\nPut peanuts in the bowl and smush them all around so they get brownie <br/>\nmix on them and then divide up the peanuts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so on --- no idea too silly - the goal to have LOTS of ideas. VERY <br/>\noften one of the ideas will just spontaneously be acceptable to all and <br/>\nyou&#39;re done.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf none are acceptable - it is WORTH it to take some time to choose one <br/>\n- you&#39;re NOT deciding how to handle the bowl-licking problem - you&#39;re <br/>\nhelping them learn problem solving skills that will be probably the <br/>\nmost useful thing they ever learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing &quot;solution-oriented&quot; is a way of life. There are people who see <br/>\nproblems as obstacles and get upset by them and lose their cool in <br/>\ntheir frustration and they end up angry. And there are people who see <br/>\nproblems as opportunities to be creative and they&#39;re challenged by them <br/>\nand they end up feeling positive and energized. Which of those do you <br/>\nwant your kids to be?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of this is innate temperament, I think, so some of us have to work <br/>\nharder to be solution-oriented than others, but that&#39;s just the way it <br/>\nis - it CAN be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nI made &quot;solution-oriented&quot; my mantra. Seriously. I&#39;ve probably repeated <br/>\nit to myself a million times since I became a parent. I now hear it in <br/>\nmy head the MINUTE there is a problem - and it reminds me that there <br/>\nare always lots of potential solutions. It keeps me from sort of <br/>\n&quot;freezing up&quot; and feeling stuck and lets me keep MY cool and do <br/>\nsomething more creative than I could otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, my natural inclination might be to simply say to the other <br/>\nkid, &quot;He asked first; you can have it next time.&quot; Well gee - THAT could <br/>\nset off world war III in my house - why is asking &quot;first&quot; the deciding <br/>\nfactor AND my kids know that we&#39;ll never remember who was supposed to <br/>\nget it &quot;next time&quot; and that could be far away and so on. Just because <br/>\none kid asked &quot;first&quot; - that isn&#39;t necessarily a good reason he/she <br/>\nshould get it - maybe the other kid wants it MORE or maybe the other <br/>\nkid didn&#39;t ask first because he wasn&#39;t there TO ask or maybe a younger <br/>\nkid didn&#39;t even realize that licking the bowl was something TO ask for <br/>\nand so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - last thing -- avoid the thought that this is all so SILLY - kids <br/>\nfighting over who gets to lick the blankety-blank brownie bowl that has <br/>\nall of about a spoonful of batter in it, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is about far more than that - it is about who feels loved and who <br/>\nfeels left out and establishing how things will be decided in your <br/>\nfamily and on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - are you sure you couldn&#39;t have jumped into the car and gone and <br/>\nbought more pop tarts when that issue came up? Going WAY out of your <br/>\nway to do things like that - inconveniencing yourself - is how the kids <br/>\nwill learn to go out of THEIR way to be generous and kind and nice to <br/>\nothers, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra once picked me up at the airport and on the way to her house <br/>\nHolly (who was 6, I think) asked if we could stop and buy some plums. <br/>\nThe first grocery store didn&#39;t have any so we drove to another one and <br/>\nwent in and THEY didn&#39;t have any either. So Sandra asked if I was too <br/>\ntired or would I mind if we tried one more store. We did and they did <br/>\nhave plums. She bought a bag full of plums for Holly, who sat in the <br/>\nback seat very very happily eating plums while Sandra and I talked and <br/>\nI got to see some of Albuquerque just by driving around.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems such a small story - but it was such a BIG moment in my life <br/>\nbecause I knew that if MY 6 yo daughter had asked for plums that I&#39;d <br/>\nhave considered that a trivial request at such a time - and put her off <br/>\nand I&#39;d have not even considered trying three grocery stores just to <br/>\nget her something she had a sudden, inexplicable urge to eat. Sandra <br/>\nknew that I was there to hang out with her - and we could do that while <br/>\ndriving around. She was looking at the &quot;reality&quot; as opposed to a <br/>\nknee-jerk response like, &quot;Holly, you don&#39;t need plums now and I&#39;m not <br/>\ndragging Pam all over Albuquerque from grocery store to grocery store.&quot; <br/>\nTHAT would have been thought and maybe said out loud by most moms, I <br/>\nthink.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain - automatically being &quot;solution-oriented&quot; and thinking of what <br/>\nCAN be done -- Sandra&#39;s first thought was whether or not Holly could <br/>\nget what she wanted at the same time we got what we wanted and the <br/>\nanswer was EASY. She didn&#39;t even know that I LIKE to go to grocery <br/>\nstores in other parts of the country - I find it fascinating to see <br/>\nwhat they have that is different than what I&#39;m used to at home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":181291537,"authorName":"Gia Omari","from":"Gia Omari &lt;giamhamilton@...&gt;","profile":"giamhamilton","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:  At the end of my rope- I hear ya....","postDate":"1103214633","msgId":101599,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMjE2MTYzMDMzLjk1Njk3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxNDAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEY2MTZGN0RCLTRGNkQtMTFEOS1BMjFFLTAwMEEyN0UxRTNGMkBhdHRnbG9iYWwubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":101598,"nextInTopic":101600,"prevInTime":101598,"nextInTime":101600,"topicId":101584,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Fonty, i only have two small kids 3.5 and 10 months and it is soooooo hard for me somedays.

Giving the <br/>\nwhole thing to one kid seems to be a parental error, not kid-unreasonability.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-As he gets closer to me I say, &quot;Be Careful of ds7&#39;s <br/>\n<br/>\ntower.&quot;  At that point he wiggles his hips extra hard and his leg <br/>\n<br/>\nknocks over the whole thing.  Ds7 jumps on him from behind and <br/>\n<br/>\ntackles him.  &quot;How come you knocked over my tower??!!!&quot;  (hit, <br/>\n<br/>\nhit)  &quot;Leave my stuff alone&quot; (hit,hit)  Ds5 starts sobbing.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a harder one.   I would&#39;ve gotten the younger one to sit by me and <br/>\ntold the older one that I would&#39;ve been on his side entirely if he hadn&#39;t jumped <br/>\nup and tackled and hit.  And then I would&#39;ve asked the midkid if he did it on <br/>\npurpose or accidentally, and talk about prevention of accidents.   Accident <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t excuse total carelessness.   Me being me, I would probably talk about <br/>\nthe difference between murder and manslaughter and tell them people can go to <br/>\nprison for manslaughter too.   And that would be distracting enough and meable <br/>\nenough th<br/>\nZ*at in the future he might consider &quot;blockslaughter&quot; and not walk within <br/>\ntouching-distance of others&#39; block towers.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-While he&#39;s talking to me ds5 comes and leans on ds7 <br/>\n<br/>\nhard enough for him to fall over.  I said `Please stop&#39;.  He didn&#39;t, <br/>\n<br/>\nknocked ds7 over, ds7 got up and kicked ds5.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe seven year old seems to be feeling crowded.  Maybe you need some time <br/>\nwith just him, to discuss being older and feeling displaced.  Be sympathetic.  <br/>\nYOU kept him from being the youngest before he was ready to give that up.   I <br/>\nused to tell Kirby that his  being mean and physical with Marty didn&#39;t make him <br/>\nor Marty better people, and it was making my own life harder.  He could <br/>\nunderstand that.  He didn&#39;t always consider it foremost when he was about to hit, <br/>\nbut sometimes he did.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you talk to an older child, don&#39;t mention how much you love the younger <br/>\nchildren or that they&#39;re just as important.  Lean toward how much you love HIM <br/>\nand then act it, too.  I was a firstborn and really resented my sister and <br/>\nthe attention she got when she came along.  Any messages that I was wrong to <br/>\nfeel that just made me dislike my mom more, and resent it more.  I was dumped for <br/>\na new kid, that was all.  And I bet your kids, being so near in age, feel <br/>\nthat too.

This gets the kids starting to do this kind of <br/>\nproblem-solving for themselves, and the family expectation starts to be <br/>\nthat everyone is happy with a solution.

I&#39;ve always been relaxed, but gradually<br/>\n&gt; shifted to unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My kids fight all the time.  I repeat, all the time.  They fight over<br/>\n&gt; everything.  I&#39;m going insane.  Here are examples just from today:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m on the couch reading to dd2 while ds7 is building with blocks at<br/>\n&gt; my feet.  Dd5 comes into the room sort of walking/wiggling/being a<br/>\n&gt; little boy.  As he gets closer to me I say, &quot;Be Careful of ds7&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; tower.&quot;  At that point he wiggles his hips extra hard and his leg<br/>\n&gt; knocks over the whole thing.

Not allowed in my family.  We don&#39;t hit people or animals or <br/>\neven sisters who are being a pain.  This has been rule from day one and <br/>\nthe girls never hit each other.  They occassionally get rough, but it&#39;s <br/>\nrare and immediately stopped (usually be the girls).  Occassionally <br/>\nJanene hits me, when angry, and I simply hold her hands and say &quot;I&#39;m not <br/>\nto be hit, I don&#39;t like to be hit, I don&#39;t hit you when I am angry, you <br/>\ncannot hit me, etc.&quot; and then I bring her into my arms and love her and <br/>\nhold her tight ( hard to hit if you are being hugged tightly and <br/>\nlovingly). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe word NO is not a bad word.  It can be your friend.  Say NO once in a <br/>\nwhile.  Not a lot, mind you.  We negotiate, and compromise and I say yes <br/>\nprobably 99% of the time, but No is a word I can use and do use. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t use time out in our house but we do take it a lot.  I take a <br/>\ntime out, to regroup, to breath, to just take a few minutes for myself, <br/>\nand I teach my children to do the same.  When the girls are having a <br/>\ntough time together, I encourage time apart.  And there is NO HITTING OR <br/>\nHURTING.  Ever.  Period.  By anyone.  by mom or dad or lexie or janene. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf Janene is loosing it we, she and I, go into another quiet room <br/>\ntogether and cuddle and talk.  Lexie and I will do the same, although <br/>\nshe rarely looses it in the same manner.  Lexie needs a different type <br/>\nof time, usually a big bear hug holding her tight will help her regain <br/>\nher emotions.  Janene needs more space, most of the time, and so we have <br/>\nto leave the room for a bit so she can have that space.  Also, she needs <br/>\nto vent and then calm down and then can talk about solutions.  Lexie can <br/>\nbe hugged and then the solutions can help her to calm down, to see that <br/>\nthere are other options, choices, ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Later.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sitting down and ds7 comes over to show me something he just read<br/>\n&gt; in a magazine.

One thing we do is talk about it afterwards.... Here are some <br/>\nquestions we use..<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat happened? <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you know why that happened?  (sometimes they can figure it out, <br/>\nsometimes they have no clue, you might help them out, were you feeling <br/>\nlike you need mommy and you didn&#39;t like it that your brother was <br/>\nthere?--this question can often not be answered...)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow could you have handled it differently?  How could *I*, the <br/>\nmom/dad/adult, have handled it differently? <br/>\n<br/>\nNext time how could we handle this situation so the outcome would be <br/>\ndifferent?  (Sometimes you have to give them the words to say, instead <br/>\nof the kick... instead you could say &quot;mom I really need your attention <br/>\nnow please.) <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Later.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m making brownies as we&#39;re going to a friend&#39;s house for supper. <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m starting the filling and ds9 calls &quot;Can I like the filling bowl<br/>\n&gt; when you&#39;re done?&quot; I say yes.  Ds7 pipes up &quot;Hey, I want to lick the<br/>\n&gt; filling bowl.&quot;  I say &quot;You can lick the frosting bowl when I make<br/>\n&gt; that this afternoon.&quot;  Ds5 says &quot;Hey that&#39;s not fair!  I want<br/>\n&gt; something to lick.&quot;  I say &quot;Well you can help me make the frosting.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; OK everything seems fine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They couldn&#39;t share?  You could&#39;nt have made a 2nd bowl for the other <br/>\nchild? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I make the filling, give the bowl to ds9.  Ds7 says &quot;can&#39;t I have<br/>\n&gt; just a little?&quot;  &quot;No!&quot; says ds9, &quot;Mom said I could have it.&quot;  Later<br/>\n&gt; when I give the frosting bowl to ds7, ds 5 starts crying &quot;How come I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have anything to lick?&quot;  I ask ds7 if he&#39;d like to share.  Of<br/>\n&gt; course, he wouldn&#39;t.  Now dd2 starts crying...she wants to lick<br/>\n&gt; something.  I have nothing more to offer!  Everyone is mad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If it&#39;s lickable, then why not make a bit more and let everyone have a <br/>\nbit of everything.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Later.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dd2 asks for a poptart.  I say yes and get it for her.  There&#39;s two<br/>\n&gt; left in the package.  (you already know what&#39;s coming, right?)  I<br/>\n&gt; hand her one; she asks for the other.  She has never, never, never<br/>\n&gt; eaten more than one pop tart, she gets too full.  I tell her to eat<br/>\n&gt; the first one and then we&#39;ll see if she&#39;s still hungry.  At that<br/>\n&gt; point ds5 grabs the second pop tart off the counter and runs way<br/>\n&gt; shouting &quot;It&#39;s mine It&#39;s mine.  I&#39;m having this pop tart.&quot;  Dd 2<br/>\n&gt; starts screaming.  I asked ds5 to please give the pop tart back to me<br/>\n&gt; and we&#39;d try to work something out.  &quot;No&quot; he says and turns around to<br/>\n&gt; try to hold it out of my reach. I try to grab it and think `this is<br/>\n&gt; crazy, I&#39;m not going to get into a grabbing match with a 5yo.&quot;  Now<br/>\n&gt; ds7 is crying there&#39;s no pop tarts left for him and I know ds9 is<br/>\n&gt; going to throw a huge fit (crying, stomping) when he gets home from a<br/>\n&gt; friend&#39;s house and sees there aren&#39;t any left.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I sometimes sing &quot;you don&#39;t always get what you want...&quot;  Bad singing <br/>\nvoice...  This is the time maybe to take a time out, everyone breath, <br/>\nlet&#39;s find a solution...<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo great books How to Talk so Kids will Listen... another one about <br/>\nsiblings... I&#39;ll think of it in a minute.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I suppose I could go buy more Pop tarts at the store, but I couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; go this exact minute and when would it end.  How many pop tarts would<br/>\n&gt; I have to buy to make everyone happy?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is this really about poptarts?  I don&#39;t think so.  I think it&#39;s about <br/>\nother things... attention? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I finally just blew up and yelled and stomped out of the room and<br/>\n&gt; into my bedroom where I locked the door.  Not the most mature thing,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I think modeling leaving and taking time away to regroup is <br/>\nmature. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but I was scared I was going to abuse my children if I didn&#39;t leave<br/>\n&gt; the room NOW.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is just a small sampling.  It&#39;s all the time.  Fighting over<br/>\n&gt; everything, being so cruel to one another.  Sometimes I feel they&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; be better off on a ps playground then home with siblings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think they need help on learning how to get along...<br/>\n<br/>\nHow often do you go to park days?

Have you ever explained to him -- maybe at a time before an incident happens, or maybe as a habitual reminder for that child -- about personal space issues?  Andy (8) tends to bump into people, and he crowds people, too.  For him, it&#39;s partly a sensory issue and as such he just doesn&#39;t get that other people have greater needs for personal space than he does.  It may take regular attention on your part to remind him to give others a wide berth.  It also might help to have him deal with the aftermath as a real consequence. When he knocked over the tower, did he pick up the blocks, or help his brother re-build?  Was he expected to?  Knowing he&#39;ll be responsible for damages may encourage him to be more careful and considerate of others.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve also found that with Andy, speaking to him isn&#39;t always enough, especially when he&#39;s excited or wound up in some way.  I reach out and place my hand on his arm or back (leg if he&#39;s sitting) as I speak to him -- it sort of re-centers his energy so he can pay attention to what&#39;s happening outside of himself.<br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

I&#39;ve always been relaxed, but gradually <br/>\n&gt; shifted to unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My kids fight all the time.  I repeat, all the time.  They fight over <br/>\n&gt; everything.  I&#39;m going insane. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking that perhaps what is happening is that you are trying to be fair all the time <br/>\nand the kids are holding you to it. But what happens is that they want more than fair so <br/>\nthey are pushing your limits to see what happens. I keep thinking of the Faber and <br/>\nMazlisch books, especially Siblings Without Rivalry.<br/>\n<br/>\nsomethien we&#39;ve done which is extremely time-consuming and yet has a high yield (and <br/>\nwe&#39;ve done it since they were very young), is take upset parties to the couch. We seat them <br/>\nopposite each other and have each one share what is bothering him/ her. The speaker <br/>\ngets uninterrupted time to say what he or she feels. The listener needs to hear all the <br/>\nwords and say back what is bothering the first one. If he or she misunderstands, the <br/>\nspeaker gets to make corrections.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you reverse it so that the other child now gets to speak and hear her/his words fed <br/>\nback.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce both have spoken and have head each other&#39;s powerful feelings, it&#39;s time for you to <br/>\nask questions that would help them discover how they would have liked to be treated <br/>\ndifferently, or they can brainstorm solutions for future episodes, or they can simply let go <br/>\n(sometimes just airing the feelings is enough).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason it is time consuming is that sometimes it means being late to a meeting or <br/>\nappointment, sometimes they won&#39;t hear each other and try to shout over each other. <br/>\nWhen that happens, we usually separate them for a few minutes and then bring them back <br/>\ntogether again when they are calmer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe brainstorming time is when you can suggest ideas too, but beware of solving it for <br/>\nthem. Kids are sensitive to parents taking over and making things unfair again. Stay <br/>\nfocused on the feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in the pop tart instance, it might be that one of the kids would say that it is unfair that <br/>\nthe little sister gets the second pop tart reserved for her when she won&#39;t really eat or finish <br/>\nit. She might say that she likes having two because it&#39;s a complete package.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce they have heard each other, it&#39;s time to help them think through how to address <br/>\nboth those concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nMight it have worked to ask for the second one as a favor? Might it have worked to split <br/>\nthe second one? Might it work better next time for you to declare that you are about to <br/>\ngive a pop tart to the sister and no one may take it or ask for it, but that you are ready to <br/>\noffer other snacks to whoever is hungry?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor stubborn kids who refuse to see anyone else&#39;s viewpoint, there is usually a longer term <br/>\nissue underneath it. Sometimes there is anger in the home or there is a feeling of <br/>\nuncertainty or desperation that is mainfesting in sibling relationships. We had this a bit <br/>\nwhen my oldest was bullied on our street. He would come home one down and that would <br/>\ntrigger some of his behavior that was less gentle.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who deliberately destroy a sibling&#39;s tower need some time alone with you to talk <br/>\nthrough why that was a satisfying thing to do - what the goal was. It may take revisiting <br/>\nthis issue multiple times.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently one of my kids wouldn&#39;t allow his sibling onto the X Box and even when we <br/>\nshowed him that in the reverse situation, he&#39;d want the same courtesy, he replied, &quot;I only <br/>\ncare about what benefits me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that moment, I took him off the X Box to have a chat with me about values and human <br/>\nbeings and what it means to demonstrate concern for others and what it means to care <br/>\nonly for self. I imagine this is not the last time we&#39;ll have this talk. :) But I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nignore it, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope some of this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Here are examples just from today:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m on the couch reading to dd2 while ds7 is building with blocks at <br/>\n&gt; my feet.

Ds7 pipes up &quot;Hey, I want to lick the <br/>\n&gt; filling bowl.&quot;  I say &quot;You can lick the frosting bowl when I make <br/>\n&gt; that this afternoon.&quot;  Ds5 says &quot;Hey that&#39;s not fair!  I want <br/>\n&gt; something to lick.&quot;  I say &quot;Well you can help me make the frosting.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; OK everything seems fine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I make the filling, give the bowl to ds9.  Ds7 says &quot;can&#39;t I have <br/>\n&gt; just a little?&quot;  &quot;No!&quot; says ds9, &quot;Mom said I could have it.&quot;  Later <br/>\n&gt; when I give the frosting bowl to ds7, ds 5 starts crying &quot;How come I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have anything to lick?&quot;  I ask ds7 if he&#39;d like to share.  Of <br/>\n&gt; course, he wouldn&#39;t.  Now dd2 starts cryingshe wants to lick <br/>\n&gt; something.  I have nothing more to offer!  Everyone is mad.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Later.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dd2 asks for a poptart.  I say yes and get it for her.  There&#39;s two <br/>\n&gt; left in the package.  (you already know what&#39;s coming, right?)  I <br/>\n&gt; hand her one; she asks for the other.  She has never, never, never <br/>\n&gt; eaten more than one pop tart, she gets too full.  I tell her to eat <br/>\n&gt; the first one and then we&#39;ll see if she&#39;s still hungry.  At that <br/>\n&gt; point ds5 grabs the second pop tart off the counter and runs way <br/>\n&gt; shouting &quot;It&#39;s mine It&#39;s mine.
