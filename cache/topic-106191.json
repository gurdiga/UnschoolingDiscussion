You *are* worrying about *nothing*.

If you check with any reputable <br/>\ndietician, they&#39;re likely to tell people should eat 5 or 6 times per <br/>\nday in smaller quantities (like crackers and cheese, a piece of <br/>\nfruit, yogurt, etc - not 6 &quot;meals&quot;). My 7 yr old DS (he&#39;ll be 7 in <br/>\nexactly one week) will eat 6 to 8 &quot;times&quot; on average in a day. <br/>\nKeeping a consistent blood sugar level is the thing - the 3 big <br/>\nsquare meals thing causes big highs and lows and that&#39;s not a good <br/>\nthing. Regular input of proteins, complex carbs, etc keeps things <br/>\nway more level and healthy. There&#39;s no way you can know what is &quot;too <br/>\nmuch&quot; for a growing child. My DS can (and did last night) eat 7 <br/>\npancakes at a sitting (I ate 3 and was comfortable). He can eat an <br/>\nentire personal-size watermelon or an average sized canteloupe over <br/>\nthe course of a day (we cut it up and make it easily accessible). He <br/>\nalso tends to be on a 36 hr eating schedule - sometimes he eats the <br/>\nbulk of his intake between rising and about 1 pm, other times it&#39;s <br/>\nbetween noon and 5, and other times it&#39;s late afternoon into <br/>\nevening. By not forcing his natural rhythms to match &quot;breakfast <br/>\ntime, lunchtime, dinnertime&quot;, he eats as he gets hungry, not simply <br/>\nbecause the clock says so. I&#39;m not going to stop him - in some <br/>\ncases, I might double check with him about what it is he wants. We <br/>\nhave a list of protein foods and another of potassium foods on our <br/>\nkitchen chalkboard because DS often chooses based on whether he <br/>\nfeels a need for protein or something else. His favorite thing is to <br/>\npick something that combines protein, complex carbs, and potassium <br/>\n(he latched onto that one in a discussion of potassium and sodium <br/>\nand blood pressure because DH is hyprertensive). PBJ on whole grain <br/>\nbread with strawberry jam fits that, for example. Or he&#39;ll have <br/>\ncheese and crackers and fruit juice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnecdotal evidence: he fell in love with a particular kind of snack <br/>\ncake last fall. We&#39;d pick up a box at the grocery when we shopped. <br/>\nOne week, they were on sale 5 boxes for $5 - so we got 5 boxes. He <br/>\nate a bunch from the first box, some from the second box, I used <br/>\nmost of the 5th box for sack lunches for work. When they were gone, <br/>\nwe were in that aisle at the market, I asked if he wanted to grab <br/>\nmore. He said &quot;No. Where&#39;s the cottage cheese at?&quot; Another time, we <br/>\nwere in the dairy aisle and I asked him if we should get ice cream, <br/>\nhe said &quot;No, we&#39;ve still got some in the freezer&quot;. He&#39;s not needy <br/>\nabout food, and he understands the trade offs involved in budgeting <br/>\nas well - x and y both cost $3, we can only afford $3 this week. <br/>\nWhich should we get? And, over time, casual discussions as we shop <br/>\nover things like sugar, sodium, price, nutrients, etc he&#39;s <br/>\ndeveloping his own personal choices - for instance, he just will not <br/>\neat &#39;pancake syrup&#39; which is just dyed corn syrup, it&#39;s gotta be <br/>\nactual maple from an actual tree type syrup.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing about snacks and car rides, I think (never heard that one <br/>\npersonally) is more about the risks of choking than about the actual <br/>\nfood intake, I would guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95085137,"authorName":"beanmommy2","from":"&quot;beanmommy2&quot; &lt;beanmommy2@...&gt;","profile":"beanmommy2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Intro and food concerns","postDate":"1117112082","msgId":106191,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ3NGd1aSs2dTJsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":106194,"prevInTime":106190,"nextInTime":106192,"topicId":106191,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, my name is Jenny and this is my first post to this group.

A couple of you may know me <br/>\nfrom one of the Christian lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have always been fairly easy-going about food, but a couple <br/>\nmonths ago I really tried to let them make almost all food choices <br/>\nthemselves.

I&#39;m wondering if, in my quest for them making choices, I&#39;m <br/>\nbeing too passive. The concerns I have are mostly with my four year <br/>\nold, although my two year does similar things to a lesser extent.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe/they seem to want to eat all day long! For the four year old, <br/>\nbreakfast might be two bowls of oatmeal, or maybe something like <br/>\nrice chex, and/or a couple eggs. They both often help themselves <br/>\nto &quot;stick cheese&quot; sometimes several times a day. They also both like <br/>\nto have &quot;snack bowls&quot; of dry cereal throughout the day, usually <br/>\nFroot Loops or maybe Chex or Cheerios.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest does not like fruit much; she might eat some once or twice <br/>\na week. If I serve peas, corn, or potatoes at dinner, she&#39;ll usually <br/>\nhave some. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess now that I&#39;m typing it doesn&#39;t sound too bad. My main <br/>\nconcerns are that they are just eating too much or having &quot;bad <br/>\nhabits.&quot; They like to eat snack bowls while they watch TV or when I <br/>\nread to them, or even during short car rides, isn&#39;t that something <br/>\npediatricians say not to allow? They eat *several* times a day; <br/>\nmaybe like eight, but I couldn&#39;t even know. It seems like all day I <br/>\nhear &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; or &quot;I want a snack&quot; or see them reaching for more <br/>\ncheese. I&#39;m just afraid that kind of Eating Continually will lead to <br/>\novereating.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other concern is them eating things like Froot Loops and candy.  <br/>\nThe obvious answer would be, Don&#39;t buy those things ... but I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant any one food, really, to be &quot;forbidden&quot; or something &quot;we don&#39;t <br/>\nkeep in our house,&quot; so when they&#39;re in the store with me and ask for <br/>\nthose chewy, sugary fruit snacks, or whatever, I let them get it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve talked with my four year old about things like listening to <br/>\nyour tummy, when it says it&#39;s empty or filled up. We&#39;ve also talked <br/>\nabout eating a variety of different foods, which I guess she does to <br/>\nsome extent. I have noticed that she *will* announce, &quot;I&#39;m done&quot; <br/>\nherself and leave even things like ice cream or cake and walk away <br/>\nfrom them. On one hand, I&#39;m glad *she* is the one making that <br/>\ndecision, instead of me telling her when she&#39;s had enough. But I&#39;m <br/>\nwondering if she&#39;s eating too much before she stops.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I can&#39;t tell, even as I&#39;m writing this, if I&#39;m &quot;worrying about <br/>\nnothing&quot; or if I need to guide her a little more in her choices, or <br/>\nsomething else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nJenny</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106217,"nextTopicId":106207}}
