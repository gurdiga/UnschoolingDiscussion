I have a recipe, but don&#39;t like <br/>\nit. <br/>\nI ate it once long ago and it was wonderful! Maybe I will just have to <br/>\nexperiment and *tweek* the recipe I have. &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I need a recipe, I go to www.google.com,<br/>\nput in the ingredients I remember or my best guess at a name, and find lots <br/>\nof similar things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do a green chile stew and pork would work, though I just use ground beef.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGreen chile, cream-style corn (for thickening and sweetening and color and <br/>\ntaste), potatoes cut small (for thickening and taste), salt, meat, cook it a <br/>\nlong time on low.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you cook the potatoes first until they&#39;re done and add the other stuff and <br/>\ncook it until it&#39;s mushy, it&#39;s really good.  You can put tomato sauce or <br/>\ncanned tomatoes, but we don&#39;t usually do that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI use one &quot;unit&quot; of green chile per pound of beef.  Fresh chopped, two big <br/>\nchiles per pound.  Or one can.  Or one of the little frozen-chile packets <br/>\nfrom costco which are our current favorite source.   That might be too much <br/>\nchile for those who prefer mild.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it might be a WHOLE different recipe than you&#39;re used to, but google will <br/>\nfind you some food!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44867,"nextTopicId":44945}}
