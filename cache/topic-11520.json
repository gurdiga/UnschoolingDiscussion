Just wanted to let you know that our \nlittlest darling (2 yo Casey) had surgery-ear tubes-this morning. All went well \nand she came through with flying colors. We were home from the hospital by 9:30 \na.m. The only thing that was a prob. was that she couldn&#39;t nurse after midnight, \nso when she wanted to at 3 am she got really upset. In her anger she manged to \nwake up fully and kept us up from that point on. I&#39;m typing this at 1:30 pm and \nit feels like the end of the day. I&#39;ve already had a 2 hr. nap. :)</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Amy</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11502,"nextTopicId":11510}}
