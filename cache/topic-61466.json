My husband and I were<br/>\nfriends first. We did have some time together at the beginning that didn&#39;t<br/>\nstart out as potential partner material. We&#39;ve been through an awful lot<br/>\ntogether that most couples don&#39;t have to weather. I never have felt like I<br/>\nneed a break from him and the same goes for him also. We never have been<br/>\napart aside from 2-3 days on maybe 3 occasions. Business trip and deaths in<br/>\nthe family. Certainly not pleasure things. We&#39;ve even spent years where we<br/>\nworked together every single day. We have no need to be apart. We spend more<br/>\ntime together than most couples I know.

Albert&#39;s forthcoming Homeschooling and the Voyage of<br/>\n&gt; Self-Discovery: A Journey of Original Seeking (Common Courage Press,<br/>\n&gt; 2003). Ingeniously crafted from plasticine, her cover, features three<br/>\n&gt; children on a boat, nicely echoing the theme in the title. She<br/>\n&gt; received the prize of $100.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The art work was then used by designers Matt Wuerker and Erica<br/>\n&gt; Bjerning who placed the title, subtitle and other type on the cover.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thomas was surprised to win. &quot;I thought for sure the prize had gone to<br/>\n&gt; someone else,&quot; she said in a recent phone call informing her that her<br/>\n&gt; work had been selected.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While writing his book last year, Albert decided to put his faith<br/>\n&gt; where his commitments were and asked his publisher to run a contest<br/>\n&gt; for a cover for his book. Greg Bates and Flic Shooter, publishers at<br/>\n&gt; Common Courage Press, were worried. &quot;One concern was whether there<br/>\n&gt; were enough young artists out there with the confidence to submit<br/>\n&gt; entries,&quot; Bates said. But their real worry was quality. &quot;What<br/>\n&gt; publisher in his right mind would entrust a cover--the most important<br/>\n&gt; piece of advertising for a book--to a contest whose contestants had to<br/>\n&gt; be 15 years of age or under,&quot; he said. &quot;I spent several sleepless<br/>\n&gt; nights worrying that we were running a contest no one would win,&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Bates continued.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But Albert, long a champion of the passions of homeschoolers, never<br/>\n&gt; wavered. &quot;We will have lots of entries and more than one great cover,&quot;<br/>\n&gt; he predicted. Albert was right on both counts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Word spread fast around the net and the network of homeschoolers. &quot;We<br/>\n&gt; live in a tiny town,&quot; noted Bates. &quot;And when we received hundreds of<br/>\n&gt; entries, even the post office took notice. It got to the point where<br/>\n&gt; the postal clerk would announce how many entries we received each<br/>\n&gt; day,&quot; he said.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shooter, in charge of the initial review of entries, said, &quot;We were<br/>\n&gt; quickly forced to develop a sorting system to handle the incoming art.<br/>\n&gt; I enlisted our seven-year-old daughter to help with the task, and was<br/>\n&gt; amazed to see how much she loved looking at the entries.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;We received several great entries,&quot; Shooter said. &quot;But Brianna&#39;s work<br/>\n&gt; took my breath away from the moment I opened it,&quot; she said.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;We hoped for a good cover,&quot; Bates said. &quot;What we got was a masterpiece.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; About the cover artist:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Brianna Kathleen Thomas did the cover art when she was thirteen years<br/>\n&gt; old. She is homeschooled and she loves to make pictures with<br/>\n&gt; plasticine and write fantasy and adventure stories. She lives with her<br/>\n&gt; Mom, dad, her sister Molly, and her two brothers, Kieran and Aidan.<br/>\n&gt; She also lives with her spunky cat, Scarlet and her dog, Griz, plus an<br/>\n&gt; assortment of gerbils.

Lots and lots of quiet.  Balm for<br/>\n&gt; a weary, weary soul.  It continued with yearly Mom&#39;s Weekend Out when a<br/>\n&gt; girlfriend (or three) would go somewhere for the weekend, leaving papa&#39;s<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; home with babes.  It was followed by conflicting work schedules, his<br/>\n&gt; getting ill (using up all his time off) and my having a family reunion<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; could NOT be missed (according to my mum) and that he didn&#39;t want to go to<br/>\n&gt; anyway.  Perfect.  I took the kids and he stayed at home with quiet<br/>\n&gt; evenings.  It still generally works out that I take the kids to my family<br/>\n&gt; events (across the country) and he takes the kids to his family events (12<br/>\n&gt; hours north) and we each try to make it to the others&#39; when we can.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s allowed us to use more of his vacation time for just-us-family time<br/>\n&gt; and trips, instead of on all the rest of the family (and no time for<br/>\n&gt; just-us-somewhere-new.)  Plus, nowadays, I&#39;ll go upcountry for a week or<br/>\n&gt; two at a time and listen to the silence, dig in the mud/ditches, wander<br/>\n&gt; down creeks, etc and just report to myself for a while.  I come back<br/>\n&gt; renewed and well, happier, with more energy for everyone!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Personality-wise, I travel great with my son, okay with my daughter and<br/>\n&gt; lousy with my husband.

We<br/>\nwork<br/>\n&gt; really well together, but we also need time away to let the niggling stuff<br/>\n&gt; dissapate.

I don&#39;t actually have<br/>\n&gt; kids. In fact, I am in college. I was unschooled until<br/>\n&gt; 8th grade, when I made the choice to go to H.S. - A<br/>\n&gt; choice I now regret but at the time seemed like I good<br/>\n&gt; idea because I too felt like I was &quot;behind&quot;. I was<br/>\n&gt; amazed by high schoolers lack of motivation and<br/>\n&gt; excitement for learning. For the first year or so I<br/>\n&gt; soaked everything up. I loved it. However, the farther<br/>\n&gt; I went the less I learned for the sake of learning and<br/>\n&gt; the more I did it for the grade. I got so wrapped up<br/>\n&gt; in getting good grades and spending time with my<br/>\n&gt; friends that I lost track of my beautiful family and<br/>\n&gt; my passions. At first I got straight A&#39;s because I<br/>\n&gt; worked hard. Later I worked hard to get straight A&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt; I stopped being able to do all the cool things I had<br/>\n&gt; done when I was unschooled. My parents just sat back<br/>\n&gt; and let me do what I said I wanted. I graduated at the<br/>\n&gt; top of my class and got several great scholarships. I<br/>\n&gt; spent my freshman year of college at a small private<br/>\n&gt; school in Kansas. I was not happy. This year, I<br/>\n&gt; transfered to the University of Northern CO in<br/>\n&gt; Greeley. I am enjoying it, but I still feel stifled<br/>\n&gt; and stuck into routines that I would rather not<br/>\n&gt; follow. A couple of weeks ago I finally started<br/>\n&gt; reading the teenage liberation handbook (My mum has<br/>\n&gt; been leaving it around for ages). It depresses me to<br/>\n&gt; think how &#39;normal&#39; my life has become. I am majoring<br/>\n&gt; in Art and Biology, and I love my classes, but I hate<br/>\n&gt; the passivity of the public educations learning<br/>\n&gt; process. I want to get out and see the world. I want<br/>\n&gt; to take bike trips accross the country, I want to sew<br/>\n&gt; a quilt, plant a garden, travel the globe. I feel like<br/>\n&gt; I never have time to pursue my passions. Once again I<br/>\n&gt; am wrapped up in getting good grades. I feel like I<br/>\n&gt; have to so I can get good scholarships that will allow<br/>\n&gt; me to afford to pay gallons of money to a school I am<br/>\n&gt; not really sure is teaching me more than I would learn<br/>\n&gt; on my own. So I think about all these things, and<br/>\n&gt; wonder if I should just quit. Rise out of school. But<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t really ever hear of college students doing it.<br/>\n&gt; You can argue that a H.S. diploma is not necessary,<br/>\n&gt; but you cannot say the same thing about a college<br/>\n&gt; degree. I would love to hear what your thoughts are<br/>\n&gt; about my situation.

All I can say to that<br/>\n&gt; is DO! My parents chose when we were really young that<br/>\n&gt; we were not going to have television in our house. My<br/>\n&gt; life has been so much fuller becuase of that one small<br/>\n&gt; choice. I do not deny that T.V. can be very<br/>\n&gt; educational, but I have the same complaint with T.V.<br/>\n&gt; as I do with public edu. It is too passive. Hours are<br/>\n&gt; lost sitting on the couch in a trance. Instead you and<br/>\n&gt; your children could be reading together, having<br/>\n&gt; afternoon teas, sewing blankets, dancing outside,<br/>\n&gt; biking to town, or just learning about each other.<br/>\n&gt; With the help of the internet and NPR, none of the<br/>\n&gt; positive aspects of television need to be lost. In<br/>\n&gt; fact, in my opinion, the best possible set-up is not<br/>\n&gt; to eliminate the T.V. completely - still have a VCR<br/>\n&gt; and watch movies occasionally, but just eliminate the<br/>\n&gt; television aspect. Think how much time you waste just<br/>\n&gt; watching commercials for things you don&#39;t need! Life<br/>\n&gt; is meant for living, not watching other people live.<br/>\n&gt; Once your T.V. is gone, I promise you will not miss it<br/>\n&gt; at all.

My husband hated High School and he<br/>\n&gt; hated University. When we got married he had two years left for his<br/>\n&gt; degree. It was a real struggle for him. Finally he decided to quit. We<br/>\n&gt; looked at our situation. He had a business, and loved it. He is a<br/>\n&gt; finance guy - does personal finance for people. The stuff he was<br/>\n&gt; learning in his finance degree was corporate finance and really didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; apply to his work. Finally, after much deliberation, he decided to quit.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes he regrets that he quit simply because he quit. He does want<br/>\n&gt; to finish his degree one day - but truthfully, I don&#39;t think it will<br/>\n&gt; have that much impact on his income, or anything else. It&#39;s just a<br/>\n&gt; personal goal he has.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do think University education can be valuable - but you have to be<br/>\n&gt; careful how you go about it.

So I think about all these things, and<br/>\n&gt; wonder if I should just quit. Rise out of school. But<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t really ever hear of college students doing it.<br/>\n&gt; You can argue that a H.S. diploma is not necessary,<br/>\n&gt; but you cannot say the same thing about a college<br/>\n&gt; degree. I would love to hear what your thoughts are<br/>\n&gt; about my situation. Thank you for listening.<br/>\n&gt; -Betony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
