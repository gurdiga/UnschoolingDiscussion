I fail to see how this will benefit Brianna & me in any way. I was raised Catholic, lived in a Catholic home, in a Catholic neighborhood, attended Catholic school; entered a convent. I later left the convent.  Later, I rec&#39;d my degree in history; I took many classes on religion; anthropology of religion, etc. I am now a pagan. A tree hugging, dirt worshipping, daughter of the Goddess. This works for us. <br/>\nBTW - thanks for the urls.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63541,"nextTopicId":64178}}
