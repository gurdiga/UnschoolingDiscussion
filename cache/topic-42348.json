I just snipped from part of it <br/>\nnot the end.<br/>\nWe made ours according to local SCA practice regulations. Out of pvc pipe (or <br/>\nmaybe it was abc, matters not), pipe insulation and duct tape.<br/>\nYou have the child (or anyone) stand straight with their hand at their side. <br/>\nMake your hand flat, your fingers all point forward...that is the correct <br/>\nheight for the &quot;sword&quot;.<br/>\nYou can cut 1/2&quot; pvc pipe to the correct height for that person (it&#39;s very <br/>\neasy to saw through with a hand saw or any electric one). Take the 1/2&quot; pipe <br/>\ninsulation and wrap the &quot;blade&quot; part down to where you want the handle. Take <br/>\na small piece of pipe insulation (about 6 inches or so) for a cross piece <br/>\nabove the handle if they want it.<br/>\nTake black duct tape and wrap the entire piece until it is fairly solid and <br/>\nsmooth.<br/>\nYou can use some colored electric tape to make a cutting edge. That isn&#39;t <br/>\nnecessary for home play though.<br/>\nI just want to offer you some thought on the guns issue. I love shooting <br/>\nguns, haven&#39;t done it much but find it very enjoyable. I am fascinated by <br/>\nweaponry of all ages, not because I like the intent, believe me. But weapons <br/>\nwere not only about protecting oneself, but about survival. It&#39;s interesting.<br/>\nI happen to eat a mostly vegetarian diet and am a very peaceful person. We <br/>\ndon&#39;t own guns, other than bebe guns, but I still like shooting.<br/>\nSo whether or not your kids want to shoot guns or any other weapon should be <br/>\nup to them in my opinion.<br/>\nUnder the safety and guidance of an interested parent, this could be a <br/>\nwonderful learning opportunity.<br/>\nYour kids may grow up to be hunters. Is that really so bad? Interest in self <br/>\nsufficiency and survival skills should be encouraged in my mind.<br/>\nBut it involves weaponry and often guns.<br/>\nI&#39;m glad you are taking the time to question your beliefs on this and ponder <br/>\nthe facts, not just have a knee jerk reaction to their fascination.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re interested in the homemade shield information, let me know.

You said your kids made swords and shields --<br/>\nhow did they do that?  Debi &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 2 boys who are now 9 & 11. When they were toddlers, I felt really<br/>\nstrongly about no guns or weapons as toys. I wanted to protect them from all<br/>\n&quot;that&quot;, and didn&#39;t feel comfortable with even play weapons of any kind. They<br/>\nwere so young and innocent, I really wanted to keep them like that and<br/>\nthought that I could.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how or why, but even though they didn&#39;t have any weapons in the<br/>\nhouse, my young boys did play-fighting anyway with their own pretend weapons<br/>\nquite often. They were always picking up sticks outside and delighted in<br/>\nfinding ones remotely shaped liked guns and &quot;shooting&quot; each other. They made<br/>\ntheir tinkertoys and other supposedly non-violent toys in the house into<br/>\nweapons like guns and swords. The final straw came when my boys were around<br/>\n3 & 5 and their grandfather (my FIL) took them on an outing to a local<br/>\nwestern-theme town (Rawhide in Scottsdale, AZ) and as a surprise for the<br/>\nday, he bought them cowboy gear complete with cowboy hats, boots, holsters<br/>\nand toy GUNS. That was their first &quot;real&quot; toy weapon and darned if they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t look so cute dressed in their little costumes and grandpa looked so<br/>\nproud. I just couldn&#39;t get mad and I decided they could keep their costumes<br/>\nand toy guns.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then my boys have acquired a whole array of toy weapons for imaginary<br/>\nplay. Everything from guns to swords to lightsabers, bows and arrows, all of<br/>\nthat. Even though they do fight (as brothers do), they have never used their<br/>\nweapons in a real fighting situation to hurt each other. They have made<br/>\nseveral of their own swords out of a piece of wood, cut with a wood saw.<br/>\nThey have made several homemade bows and arrows when they get in the mood<br/>\nfor that. They really enjoy imaginary play fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have just learned to loosen up alot on my feelings about weapons. I found<br/>\nthat my boys made their own weapons when we didn&#39;t have any, so what was the<br/>\npoint of enforcing a no-weaopns rule? My boys are also very compassionate<br/>\npeople who are very sensitive to real-life death or killing or war<br/>\nsituations. Right now my youngest is very worried when he learned that all<br/>\nboys who turn 18 (I think?) have to sign up for the selective service system<br/>\nand possibly be called to fight in a war. Frankly, I&#39;m a little worried for<br/>\nhim, too, but I don&#39;t dwell on that and I told him he shouldn&#39;t either.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Sword play","postDate":"1030555664","msgId":42394,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDgyODEwMjI0OS4wMWQxNzc4MEBwb3AuaXNsYW5kbmV0LmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwMjA4MjgwODM1MzguMDBhNTUzMjBAcG9wMy5ub3J0b24uYW50aXZpcnVzPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwNmYwMWMyNGVhNiQxZGI5MGU4MCQyN2E2NTYxOEBlZC5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0PiA8MTJmLjE2YTEzNzkwLjJhOWUzYmY3QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":42383,"nextInTopic":42395,"prevInTime":42393,"nextInTime":42395,"topicId":42348,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

This is honestly the first time this has come up!  There was absolutely *no* interest in weapons of any kind before this point, so I naively believed we had successfully passed that issue.  I know when my dh first started wrestling matches with the kids, I was very uncomfortable because it seemed so violent, especially as that was the only way he was physical with our son (no cuddles or kisses; that&#39;s just not how he was raised).  However, as time went on and our daughters were born, he &quot;rassled them down to the ground&quot; as well, but started being more physically affectionate too, even with ds.  Now it&#39;s just a matter of course, and I have learned that the &quot;rough housing&quot; seems to serve a real need between the kids and their dad.  I hope that&#39;s how the sword play evolves, too.

We cover them in foil. <br/>\nWe once tried balsa wood, but when it broke there were splinters. So even <br/>\nthough the cardboard isn&#39;t as strong as we would like it is safer. We make <br/>\nshields the same way. I get those fake plastic jewels and rhinestones and we <br/>\nglue them to our cardboard shield. I attach a piece of fabric rope or leather <br/>\nto the back for a handle. We also have crowns, *gold* money (bought at the <br/>\nparty supply store) which we keep in one of those purple Crown Royal bags, <br/>\nand jewels. We also made a jewel encrusted treasure box out of an old shoe <br/>\nbox, plastic jewels and different colors of foil. Right now Moly is painting <br/>\na piece of paper with brown watercolor. When she is finished, I will burn the <br/>\nedges for her and she is going to crumple it up and then make it into a map. <br/>\nWe have also dyed paper with tea. I go to my local scrapbook store for unique <br/>\npapers and foils for Moly. I also frequent Hobby Lobby and pick up things <br/>\nthere. We made eye patches out of black leather and punched holes for an <br/>\nelastic cord. I buy tulle (especially the kind with sparkles) on sale and the <br/>\nkids just wrap themselves in it, for when they are playing the *rich* queen <br/>\nor a fairy. I found these long stems with curls at the top, dipped in <br/>\nglitter, at Hobby Lobby. (I think they are used for floral arraignments?) <br/>\nAnyway, we use those as fairy wands. I attach silk ribbons and little bells <br/>\nto them. (To me, it looks more authentic than those plastic wands with <br/>\nglittery stars on the top.) Moly says she likes it better because she knows a <br/>\nfairy wouldn&#39;t use a plastic wand, she would find a curly stick, dip it in <br/>\nfairy dust and put *prettys* on it. (right now, she is more interested in the <br/>\nguy parts, and doesn&#39;t want to play the little princess or fairy though &lt;g&gt;) <br/>\nWe have ballet slippers, old leather boots, long skirts, and old pants. You <br/>\ncan tuck an old pair of pants, two or three sizes too big, into the tops of <br/>\nboots and blouse the pants to make them look like pirates, then tie a rope <br/>\nfor a belt. Add a little (or big sister, or baby brother...) sister dressed <br/>\nin ballet slippers or bare feet and lots of tulle, don&#39;t comb her hair and <br/>\nsend them out to play!<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":698073,"authorName":"marji","from":"marji &lt;zintz@...&gt;","profile":"gaia10921","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Sword play","postDate":"1030549810","msgId":42352,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwMjA4MjgwODM1MzguMDBhNTUzMjBAcG9wMy5ub3J0b24uYW50aXZpcnVzPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNmYwMWMyNGVhNiQxZGI5MGU4MCQyN2E2NTYxOEBlZC5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEyZi4xNmExMzc5MC4yYTllM2JmN0Bjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":42351,"nextInTopic":42353,"prevInTime":42351,"nextInTime":42353,"topicId":42348,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I guess I was just wondering about easing up on swords and arrows, while still keeping a &quot;no guns&quot; rule, as I just cannot find any redemptive value in pretending to spray someone with bullets.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;And my children are extremely compassionate human beings that think war is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>awful and are very sensitive to meanness in the world.<br/>\nI don&#39;t see how sword play is going to change that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter careful consideration, I came to the same conclusion, but I just can&#39;t seem to get over my distaste for toy guns.  Mary-the-pacifist, do you have any thoiughts on this?  Anyone else?<br/>\n Sword play and archery I have come to see the beauty in, especially for fantasy play, but I still don&#39;t want them aiming at each other.  Obviously swords would be more satisfying in a duel, though ... and what about the merits of homemade over fake?  You said your kids made swords and shields -- how did they do that?
