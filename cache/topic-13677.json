I <br/>\ndid a ton of research when my second child (now 10 months) got recurring ear <br/>\ninfections and was exclusively breastfed.  I found a couple of studies that <br/>\nsuggested a link between dairy intake in mom and an increase chance of ear <br/>\ninfections in baby.

I have yet to add back ice <br/>\ncream which I would eat EVERY night (hormones I guess!!).  So far so good -- <br/>\nit could be coincidence but it did work and almost immediately.
