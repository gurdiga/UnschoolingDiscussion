He bought it ( with a loan from his <br/>\nGrandpa) from my sister.  He has been working about 35 hours a week this summer.  <br/>\n  Anna has also been working on the farm about 12 hours a week.  She has <br/>\nsaved up quite a good chunk of money.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s see, does any of that have to do with unschooling?  Hmm, let me see,. <br/>\nAnna has learned a lot on the farm about trees ( how to trim different kinds, <br/>\nhow to identify different kinds) animal habitats ( bees nests, snake holes, <br/>\nmouse nests,  etc), safety around heavy equipment,.   She has learned how to keep <br/>\ntrack of her hours and figure her salary.  She has learned how difficult it <br/>\nis to work for her Grandpa.. and also how fun it is to work for her Grandpa...( <br/>\nyes, a real dichotomy).   Gosh, I am sure she has learned probably a lot more <br/>\nthan I am aware.<br/>\n<br/>\nEthan helps on the farm occasionally, picking up roots, rocks or pulling <br/>\nweeds.  He needs constant supervision though.. If  someone  is not nearby  to <br/>\nremind him, he will stop working and just zone out.  He likes making the money, <br/>\nbut he often forgets  Grandpa won&#39;t pay him for sitting on a rock.   As long as <br/>\nsomeone else is there working with him, he&#39;s fine.   But  you can&#39;t give him a <br/>\njob and just leave him to do it.  He just got a new gameboy advance and he <br/>\nwants some new games, so his motivation for working is pretty high right now.   <br/>\nHe has also learned how to figure his salary so he knows exactly how many <br/>\nhours he needs to work to get his new game.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJP is still going to karate 3 times a week.. He is testing for his yellow <br/>\nbelt next Saturday. He is very excited!.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are getting the puppies ready to find new homes next week.  They are <br/>\ngrowing beautifully.  They got thier 2nd dose of worm medicine today and they are <br/>\ngetting their shots next week.   We have all learned a lot about puppies with <br/>\nthis litter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThats our unschooling life update.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75097,"nextTopicId":75106}}
