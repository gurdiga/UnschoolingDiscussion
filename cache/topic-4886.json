We don&#39;t celebrate the holiday any more, having<br/>\nswitched to Solstice/Yule--where the focus is on togetherness, observing<br/>\nNature&#39;s cycles, peace, and forgiveness. We still give a few gifts to<br/>\nthose closest to us. The great majority of these are self-made, using<br/>\nwhatever materials currently interest us. This year, it is small clay<br/>\nornaments and bowls.<br/>\n\tThere is so much &quot;pressure&quot; to stay in the Holiday Madness--from the<br/>\npsychological barrage of advertisements, to relatives who insist on<br/>\nsending stuff you couldn&#39;t care about, just because they *have* to send<br/>\n*something*-- it can be  a real challenge to break away from that habit.<br/>\nLittle by little, we do.

Someone among you asked my rituals for the season.  Here&#39;s an<br/>\ninteresting season ritual, though I&#39;ve only done it three times.  A<br/>\ntherapist would have a field day.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the evening of Thanksgiving Day, I gather up all the ads for the<br/>\nAfter Thanksgiving Sale -- we don&#39;t celebrate Christmas, but the sales<br/>\nare good, I&#39;m told (actually they just mark up the prices on all &quot;winter<br/>\n<br/>\ngoods&quot;, and then take 40% off.)  I decide what I &#39;need&#39; or &#39;want&#39; (when<br/>\nI say &quot;I&quot;, it is a &quot;corporate I&quot;, like in family.)  There&#39;s usually one<br/>\nor at most two things, scattered around 6 or 7 different stores.  I get<br/>\nup at 6:00 a.m., having told my daughters how important it is to arrive<br/>\nearly, and having convinced them of the superiority of each particular<br/>\nitem in the store which is our destination.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe arrive at the first store a little before 7.  Stand in line.<br/>\nPurchase item.  Then on to the next store, and the next.  Sometimes we<br/>\nhave to choose among colors, or designs, or what-not.  But no<br/>\ntomfoolery.  We stick to the list.  We don&#39;t browse.  We don&#39;t look at<br/>\npants in the store where we buy jackets, or ties where we get<br/>\nbedspreads. We don&#39;t get distracted by trinkets.  We avoid &quot;smellville&quot;<br/>\n(that&#39;s what we call the cosmetics section.) And we stick to our list<br/>\nof  stores. No straying.  By 11:00 A.M. we are home, 14 or 15 items in<br/>\nhand.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy 11:30, after contemplating our booty, I have convinced myself, and<br/>\nmost of the family members, that at least half the things we have<br/>\npurchased we didn&#39;t really need, or they aren&#39;t particular nice, or they<br/>\n<br/>\naren&#39;t any superior to the same item we saw for 10% of the price we paid<br/>\n<br/>\nin the local thrift store.  Over the next 3 days, we will bring at least<br/>\n<br/>\nhalf the items back.  I&#39;ll end up sending the extra money to India (or<br/>\nto wherever I think it is needed.) -- or, it is true, in some cases,<br/>\nI&#39;ll exchange what we bought for different stuff. But I&#39;ll have burned<br/>\nup 10 gallons of gas, generated fair quantities of stress, and used up<br/>\ngood chunks of three days which we could have spent together in more<br/>\nlife-fulfilling activities in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is about my affirming that I have enough money in my<br/>\npocket, that I can do the mall thing like anyone else (I only do it once<br/>\n<br/>\na year!), and that the trappings of middle class America are there to me<br/>\n<br/>\nfor the taking.  And then, after about four hours, nausea sets in, and I<br/>\n<br/>\nbegin retracing my steps.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone else suffer from this malady?<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert<br/>\n<br/>\n(I have an abbreviated version of this malady which is specifically<br/>\nrelated to K-Mart, which can occur at any time of the year.  I go there<br/>\nto buy underwear -- all right, I&#39;m cheap!  I&#39;ll wheel the cart around,<br/>\nfinding all kinds of different  stuff I need or might use.  But only for<br/>\n<br/>\napproximately 7 minutes. It&#39;s always 7 minutes. If they can get me out<br/>\nof the store within 7 minutes, they can ring up a big sale.  But it<br/>\nnever happens.  Nausea sets in at the 7 minute mark.  I start dropping<br/>\nitems out of my cart randomly throughout the store.  I&#39;m sure they<br/>\nwonder how the galoshes ended up next to deoderant.  Until there is<br/>\nnothing, or almost nothing left in the cart but the underwear.  If the<br/>\ncheckout line is more than 5 people long, I am likely to abandon the<br/>\ncart and leave.
