Mostly that have had the choice but I had still felt the need to step in. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell this morning my 3 year old was playing and didn&#39;t want to eat what my 7 yo had fixed {some speggetti O&#39;s} <br/>\n<br/>\nI left her alone. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe fell asleep while her and her oldest sister  were playing the Playstation and later woke up and wanted a sucker. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe thought at first I wouldn&#39;t let her have it, but I gained her trust and told her I&#39;d open it for her. After a couple of licks she decided she didn&#39;t want it so insted of making her eat it because she had asked for it, I told her I&#39;d wrap it up for later. She decided she wanted a &quot;Hot Pocket&quot; and happily ate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes this stuff works. In the end it just seems to be a control issue. I&#39;m trying to give them control and only step in when it would be a REALLY bad decision. <br/>\n<br/>\n Say something like if she wanted to eat vitimins like candy or something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
