I know several people, including myself, who have found good <br/>\nalternative doctors in their area under the heading of D.O. (Doctor <br/>\nof osteopathy) who specialize in alternative methods, such as <br/>\nnaturopathy.  I found a very gentle chiropractor who uses a lot of <br/>\naccupressure in his treatments and a D.O. in my search for an <br/>\nalternative way to deal with my thyroid issues, which included a lot <br/>\nof back pain, because my adrenal glands were completely out of <br/>\nwhack.  (Apparently, if your adrenals aren&#39;t functioning properly you <br/>\ncan have alot of lower back pain and headaches).  I also read <br/>\nsomewhere that thyroid disease is very common and can even be a <br/>\nmisdiagnosed as fibromyalgia.  My problem was that my adrenal glands <br/>\nhad been working so hard to keep up with the high sugar/carb. diet I <br/>\nwas on, that eventually my thyroid had to start helping out and then <br/>\neverything seemed like it fell apart.  Anyway, I think if you found a <br/>\ngood doctor with an alternative mindset, he/she would be more <br/>\ninterested in getting your whole body back to proper functioning, <br/>\nrather than just covering up your symptoms with a prescription.  <br/>\nGood luck, <br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, Have A Nice Day! <br/>\n&lt;litlrooh@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ok all, I need to ask if any of you can help me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have TERRIBLE back pain (upper back and neck).

It isn&#39;t true that you have to commit to going forever, though you do have to go consistently for a while for it to work.  As for the Uric Acid, if you reduce the amount of protein, especially animal protein, that you eat, you will greatly affect your UricAcid level. Have you ever tried alternative Dr.s?

Started up yoga and my life changed,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-490322678\">Kristen,<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you tried yoga?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a life saver for me,  I have fibromyalgia and used to be on all sorts of drugs.   Started up yoga and my life changed,  truly.   You can do little bits,  little stretches and then do more as you get more flexible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t do it as much as I should,  but I feel so much better with even the little bit that I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need any more info you can e-mail me off list.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Have A Nice Day! <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, May 22, 2003 3:45 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] OT: In pain and getting desparate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ok all, I need to ask if any of you can help me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have TERRIBLE back pain (upper back and neck).  I&#39;ve had this for years, but its so much worse this week.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I also at times have joint pain *everywhere*, in *every* joint possible.  During those times, I also have nausea, etc that feels like when I had mono.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve had tests done...zip.  Nobody knows whats going on.  Some of it is arthritis I think, some of it is peripheral nerve root compression in my neck (the headaches are only on one side).<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can&#39;t take this anymore.  Its to the point where I can&#39;t be up and around longer than 4 hours before I have to lay down or I get an incapacitating headache just from holding my head up.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I used to just take 800 motrin at night.  Now i have to take it all the time just to get any relief at all, and even that isn&#39;t much.  The few times I&#39;ve taken percocet for other things (after a tooth was pulled, etc) it was the *only* time in about 20 years that I&#39;ve had NO pain and what a joy that was.  But I don&#39;t dare take percocet all the time...its a narcotic and addictive.  Is there anything I can take that will relieve this pain that is not addictive?  Any herbal remedies?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I need exercises to strengthen my back, especially the rhomboid muscles on either side of the spinal column.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Can anyone help me.  I&#39;m really worried that if I don&#39;t find some kind of exercise I can actually do, that I will end up in a wheelchair in another 10 years.  I can swim, and will be starting water aerobics in a couple of weeks, but is there anything else I can do specifically for my back?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I tried lifting weight and that seems to have made it worse.  Even walking seems like something I can&#39;t do consistantly.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for anything you can share that might help!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
