For us the bible is very interesting collection of stories.<br/>\nMy husband and I both read the bible together in the early stages of our<br/>\nmarriage.  My husband I were to be lifted up to bible leaders in the<br/>\nchurch we were in many years ago.  My children are familiar with it.  My<br/>\noldest more so than the rest but that has been out of curiosity since<br/>\nmost of her friends are catholic. And if my kids want to take a CCD<br/>\nclass or go to a bible group I would be more than open to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Jesus. My entire family sees him as a great teacher. My husband<br/>\nsees him as a shaman. My children see him much the same way I do. A<br/>\ngreat man who lived long ago who came to teach us much.  Much like your<br/>\nfriend I see Jesus as a great prophet but not the son of God. I<br/>\npersonally believe the teaching of Jesus are a good thing to read to<br/>\nkids as well as Buddha&#39;s teachings and many others.<br/>\n<br/>\nShelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 11<br/>\n   Date: Mon, 22 Jan 2001 20:55:23 -0600<br/>\n   From: &quot;uebinger robyn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:emersonsage@...\">emersonsage@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Re: Pagan e-group<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes the bible play any part in your life? I mean even as a historical<br/>\ndocument. Do you disregard it totally? I have a friend who is a Hindu<br/>\n(from<br/>\nIndia) who knows more about the bible and Jesus than most proclaimed<br/>\nChristians. She also holds Jesus in great esteem as a prophet but not as<br/>\nthe<br/>\nson of God. How does that fit in your beliefs? Religion is one of my<br/>\npassions. I am so curious. I would appreciate any info. you would be<br/>\nkind<br/>\nenough to give me. Excuse me if my questions seem silly. Thanks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15327,"nextTopicId":15329}}
