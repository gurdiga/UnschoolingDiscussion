When I registered my son for school so he could join<br/>\nchess club and use the library (our post library is awful), they wanted to<br/>\ntest him for Talanted and Gifted (TAG).  I asked a lot of questions as to<br/>\nwhat the TAG classes were studying, and was told that they&#39;re learning<br/>\nFrench because languages are &quot;so good for kids&quot;, and they learn to play<br/>\nchess, and some other things like 5th grade is learning Algebra.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son already plays chess, and we live in GERMANY, folks.  They get a very<br/>\nbasic dash through German culture for 1 hour a week in their classrooms, why<br/>\nnot work on their GERMAN, since it would have practical use!  Oy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that strikes me for your friend, though, is the last sentence.
