She is an <br/>\n  extraordinarily kind and gentle person who absolutely FULLY lives what <br/>\n  she writes. She is excruciatingly honest. She has talked, online, <br/>\n  frequently about what she, herself, is still learning. She has talked <br/>\n  about her own mistakes and her own regrets and weaknesses. She <br/>\n  questions and examines her own behavior constantly. She has never held <br/>\n  herself up as perfect - just as certain as one can be that &quot;unschooling <br/>\n  works.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    Sandra has a tremendous amount of personal integrity and cares very <br/>\n  deeply about all children. She lays bare her own family&#39;s experiences, <br/>\n  both good and bad, in great detail, in her published columns in HEM as <br/>\n  well as online on email lists and on the unschooling-dotcom message <br/>\n  boards and on her website. Sandra attracts &quot;followers&quot; because some <br/>\n  people feel a very strong attraction to someone who gets right to the <br/>\n  heart of matters and says exactly what she thinks - she&#39;s not <br/>\n  infallible, of course, but she is very often absolutely right on target <br/>\n  in her perceptions and often says just the right thing to shake someone <br/>\n  out of whatever kind of box they might have been stuck in. She helps <br/>\n  many of us push out our own boundaries and we are braver and stronger <br/>\n  and our children are healthier and happier because of what she helped <br/>\n  us see and learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That same insightfulness combined with directness and very very literal <br/>\n  writing, always saying exactly what she means, clearly is not <br/>\n  appreciated by all. I just wish that when they don&#39;t like it, they&#39;d <br/>\n  just ignore it and I especially wish that other people would <br/>\n  investigate for themselves and not be influenced by the backbiting and <br/>\n  not repeat things when they have no firsthand knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So - that&#39;s my personal testimony - not the first time many of you have <br/>\n  heard it. I have nothing to gain by defending Sandra, nothing other <br/>\n  than my own sense of doing the right thing. We met online - she shook <br/>\n  me up and my life has never been the same.  I pay her back by doing my <br/>\n  own work - speaking, writing, and helping other parents give their <br/>\n  children the gifts that unschooling can bring. That&#39;s all she cares <br/>\n  about - she&#39;s not in competition with anybody, not out for power for <br/>\n  herself, just for the ideas - the principles - of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra exemplifies selfless devotion to making the world a better place <br/>\n  for as many children as she can. And she doesn&#39;t deserve to be raked <br/>\n  over the coals for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
