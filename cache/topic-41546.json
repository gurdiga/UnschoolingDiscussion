These are accounts that have been written by elephant trainers:<br/>\n<br/>\nTrainers Grim Details of Discipline<br/>\nIn addition to bullhooks, trainers use baseball bats, ax handles, <br/>\npitchforks, and electric shock. Chains, ropes, and block-and-tackle are <br/>\nused as restraints.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlan Roocroft, an elephant consultant to circuses and zoos, cowrote in his <br/>\nbook Managing Elephants:<br/>\n<br/>\n[W]hen corporal punishment is administered to an elephant, it has to be <br/>\nfairly forceful in order that it is perceived by the elephant to be <br/>\npunishment at all.  [T]he trainer must now intimidate the animal in order <br/>\nto acquire a dominant position.  [R]estraining a potentially hostile <br/>\nelephant needs at least a crew of eight, preferably 10, in order to insure <br/>\nsufficient muscle is available. Once immobilized, the elephant may be the <br/>\nobject of punishment in the form of blows with a wooden rod.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn I Loved Rogues, elephant trainers George &quot;Slim&quot; Lewis and Byron Fish wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nCircus animals are performers, and training them depends on a certain <br/>\namount of rough treatment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is true of training for performance is even more true of the basic <br/>\ndiscipline that must be established before an elephant can work or act. It <br/>\nisn&#39;t kept in a cage, and, while it is chained much of the time, there are <br/>\nmany occasions when it walks at liberty with only the respect it pays its <br/>\nhandler to keep it in check. It is absolutely essential, therefore, that <br/>\nthe animal must have this respect for its handler; and to get down to blunt <br/>\nfacts, this quality begins with fear: fear of punishment and discomfort.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good stout stick should be used, and it should have a sharp prod on the <br/>\nend of it to keep the elephant from turning its head.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Teaching an elephant to lie down is] done by gradually tightening the <br/>\nchain, a few inches at a time, until the elephant is supporting its weight <br/>\nentirely on the front and hind legs that are free. It is very tiring for a <br/>\nbull to hold up its mass in this manner. When the handler sees it <br/>\nweakening, he gives the command, Down! Come on down.<br/>\nThe command is repeated until the elephant obeys. Just before it gives in, <br/>\nit will show signs of fear and defeat. Its eyes will bulge and its bowels <br/>\nbecome loose and watery as they are emptied several times.<br/>\nWhen the elephant finally surrenders and falls over on its side, it knows <br/>\nit is comparatively helpless and that it has lost a psychological battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was excerpted from <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.circuses.com/bullhook.html\">http://www.circuses.com/bullhook.html</a> .

But I am not <br/>\ntalking about other kinds of animal shows.  I am not attempting to indict <br/>\neveryone involved in every type of animal showing.  I don&#39;t know enough <br/>\nabout it for one thing, and I appreciate your shedding light on the <br/>\nsubject.  But, about circuses, rodeos, and roadside &quot;zoos&quot; I do know a <br/>\nthing or two about, and the norm in these venues is cruelty and <br/>\nexploitation for greed and profit.  I can say that there is no such thing <br/>\nas a humane circus act or a humane rodeo.  Whenever you see exotic, wild <br/>\nanimals performing in unnatural ways, fear and intimidation are essential <br/>\nparts of the trainer&#39;s bag to tricks to get them to do this.  Where exotic <br/>\nanimals are concerned, not only are the animals subjected to cruel <br/>\ntreatment, but people are exposed to dangerous situations.  In these <br/>\nsituations, the animals never win.  I cannot imagine the justification for <br/>\nplucking a wild animal out of its natural setting to be subjected to a <br/>\nlifetime of horrors.  To suggest otherwise is pure denial.  No insight can <br/>\nbe gained, no conservation efforts realized.  Furthermore, when animal <br/>\ncircuses and rodeos are held out as &quot;educational&quot; opportunities for <br/>\nchildren and the public, nothing other than the acceptance of cruelty is <br/>\ntaught.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, the animal circus industry is not doing all that well these <br/>\ndays.  Attendance has been declining at circuses that use animal acts and <br/>\nanimal-free circuses have been steadily gaining in popularity.  In April <br/>\n2001, Time Magazine said, &quot;Mixing hokum with the perception of brutality, <br/>\nthe traditional circus seems uncomfortably out of place in todays <br/>\nentertainment market.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~marji~<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: animal cruelty","postDate":"1029863705","msgId":41546,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTAwMWMyNDg2ZCQyZWYyZTJhMCRmYjgwZWU0MEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMjk4MjQwNjUuMTUyNy42NjY5Mi5tM0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":41560,"prevInTime":41545,"nextInTime":41547,"topicId":41546,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Well of course they ve been documented.
