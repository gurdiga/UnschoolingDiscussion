So far we have had <br/>\none of the four kids birthdays, and we plan on following the same for each.  <br/>\nFirst of all I bake a cake from scratch (I use a favorite recipe of the kids <br/>\nand the taste beats any box cake mix or even a cake from Donut Bank) and <br/>\ndecorate it for the younger ones.  We use all of the money (since we don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to pay for a party) on the gifts that they choose (they know the amount <br/>\nthat we spend, so they aren&#39;t expecting something that is way out of the <br/>\nprice range---causing a dissapointment).  We give grandma a few gift ideas <br/>\n(she also has given them an amount that she will spend).  The only other <br/>\nperson that comes is my best friend with her two kids.  It is a very small, <br/>\nintimate gathering with all attention paid to the birthday child.  The <br/>\nweekend of that childs birthday, he or she can have 2 or 3 friends over to <br/>\nspend the night.  Since we have already had &quot;the party&quot;, this is just for the <br/>\ncompanionship of friends for the birthday child.  Sometimes these friends may <br/>\nopt to bring a gift, but we let them know that it is not necessary.  My kids <br/>\nhave really enjoyed doing things this way.  Usually the night of the <br/>\nsleepover is spent playing with all the birthday gifts the child received <br/>\nfrom the party of a few days before.  Relaxing and yet fun!<br/>\nTami</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Pokerdog70@xxx.xxx","from":"Pokerdog70@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"gOIOiR2KaCgupB2rBI6AheKErKIBTecgWlOQmJ8r-Vfb7lTDTL8lxY_edJrdWjyThNV_-rQZrj7j","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Birthday Parties","postDate":"938530522","msgId":3362,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMjkuMzM2Mi45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3399,"prevInTime":3361,"nextInTime":3363,"topicId":3362,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Tami, I couldn t agree with you more!
