It happened in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; March at the school in the village of Leask, north<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of Saskatoon.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Saskatchewan Valley director of education Michael<br/>\n&gt; &gt; McLeod says a teacher put a strip of masking tape<br/>\n&gt; &gt; over the children&#39;s laps. He says it was meant to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; teach fidgety children to stay in their seats.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; McLeod says it was a bad idea. But he says a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disciplinary report on the teacher&#39;s file is all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; punishment that&#39;s warranted.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The board recognized that she was facing a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; challenging situation and sort of reaching into the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; barrel or the bag of tricks to try to indicate to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; these kids that they needed to behave appropriately<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or acceptably.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;So they felt that a letter was appropriate. It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t malicious. It wasn&#39;t harmful. Nobody was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; being restrained or injured.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; McLeod says allegations that the teacher restrained<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the students using duct tape are false.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lana Johnstone-Ledoux&#39;s six-year-old son, Brandon,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was one of the children taped to his seat. She<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thinks the teacher should have been punished more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; severely.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;At least they did something, but it&#39;s nothing to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what I imagined what would have happened. I believed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she was going to be removed for doing this.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I am really disappointed in what she did and how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they dealt with her, because [if] you&#39;re in a day<br/>\n&gt; &gt; care and you decide to do something like this to a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kid, you&#39;re not going to have a job.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Johnstone-Ledoux took her son out of the Leask<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school after the incident. He finished the year at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the school on the nearby Mistawasis Band reserve. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22645,"nextTopicId":22653}}
