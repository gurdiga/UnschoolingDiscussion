I liked that description and felt some of it really applied...<br/>\n <br/>\nHowever, before I get too grandiose and full of my bad self, I have to admit that on several questions I thought, Hmmmm, well, it depends on the situation.  So how accurate can that be?  I guess others might have had more self-knowledge and answered more assuredly.  I have to read the other posts.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was fun though.  I took this test about twelve years ago and I know my answers were very different.  Having children has definately changed me for the better.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI saw &quot;The Emeror&#39;s Club&quot; with Kevin Kline last night.  It&#39;s premise is that character determines fate;  despite the efforts of his teacher and his father to &quot;mold&quot; his character, this guy remains &quot;bad&quot;.  The guy was pissed at the world because he was abused by his father and the movie tried to say that he was stuck in that sad, valueless place.  I think our character, personality, passion is always capable of evolving if we aren&#39;t being &quot;molded&quot; by someone or other.  (I guess the idealism part is true).  but I thought it was a bad movie, horrible premise.  Thanks for the test though.
