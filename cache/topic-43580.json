I have been lurking, like <br/>\nusual and it definitely caught my eye. If Sandra had not mentioned <br/>\nit, I would not have remember it&#39;s been a year ---AND WHAT A YEAR! <br/>\nOne of the tidbits of information that did not make it to the article <br/>\nwas my goal for this first year --to explore NYC and to start out <br/>\nfrom the tallest point in the city. We were going to the trade that <br/>\nWednesday. The rest is history.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have to take the kids there. I am so spaced out I was going <br/>\nto take them today to a park that is just a few blocks away but I <br/>\ndecided against it. Mark left for Vienna for Ars Electronica (a huge <br/>\nconvention for Internet developers and artists) and I would not want <br/>\nto remind Evan of what he witnessed a year ago. He still has vivid <br/>\nimages of it even as I have made sure that he does not watch any <br/>\nnews. I do not want to make him worried sick about his father and <br/>\nyet, I am ---the people at Ars do not have yet a return ticket for <br/>\nMark because they are waiting to see what is going to happen after <br/>\nthe 11th :-( These are very trying times.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, today all his friends are in school. We declined his <br/>\nadmittance to a magnet school here in NYC because, after a year, this <br/>\nis what makes sense. We are actually getting ready to go to the <br/>\nAmerican Museum of National History. He&#39;s been obsessed with volcanos <br/>\nand wants to see what the museum has about them. Also, they are doing <br/>\nrenovations on our building&#39;s roof and we happen to live on the top <br/>\nfloor. For the next month and a half we have to spend most of our <br/>\ndays out of this place if we do not want to be jackhammered to <br/>\ndeafness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo is the life and yet, as Mary (zenmomma) says, life is good.<br/>\n<br/>\nWrite to y&#39;all soon,<br/>\nLiza</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43579,"nextTopicId":43581}}
