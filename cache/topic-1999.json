Going into Gr 1 I knew that<br/>\nher small motor skills were weak and knew that she did know how to print,<br/>\nbut that it was quite messy. They zoomed through printing and then went on<br/>\nto script, because in that enviroment beautiful handwriting with a fountain<br/>\npen was what they aimed for. Of course she was thrown for a loop and her<br/>\nscript was very messy (which the teacher told her again and again). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got back to Canada and were finally able to home ed again I told<br/>\nher to forget all about script and print for as long as she wanted to. She<br/>\nprinted for about a year and then said she was ready to learn to write. She<br/>\nalready had the skills so when she took off on handwriting it turned out to<br/>\nbe quite beautiful (her own style combining German italic-style with some<br/>\nCanadian style letters.)<br/>\nHowever, when she has to write now (Gr 10) she is still much more<br/>\ncomfortable with printing.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy T from Alberta Canada (mom to Janelle 14 and Katrina 12)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1985,"nextTopicId":1978}}
