At what point, if ever, should I  be<br/>\nconcerned enough about her speech to seek professional help?  I&#39;ve  talked to<br/>\nher before about her R&#39;s.  She knows that she cannot speak  the true R sound<br/>\nand I&#39;ve had her focus on how I say a word with R in it so  that she<br/>\nrecognizes that the word is spelled with an R not a W.  I  certainly don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to do anything to discourage her from writing and she  doesn&#39;t care very<br/>\nmuch that her invented spelling is difficult for some to  read.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n <br/>\nHolly couldn&#39;t pronounce &quot;r&quot; at that age, but she wasn&#39;t starting to spell  <br/>\nyet.  When she wanted to write, she would dictate and then copy it back  down <br/>\nin her own hand.  But even after she got better at &quot;r&quot; she would often  ask if <br/>\na word had a &quot;r&quot; in it, so that she could think about how it would be  <br/>\nspelled. She could hear other people&#39;s &quot;r&quot; usually, but when spelling she was  going <br/>\nfrom her own pronunciation.  (Or if someone wasn&#39;t understanding what  she was <br/>\nsaying, she would ask if the word had an &quot;r&quot; so they could help figure  out <br/>\nwhat she meant by plugging an &quot;r&quot; in.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had some friends who  were speech therapists, and two of them did single <br/>\n(casual) sessions with Holly,  one at a party, and one at a restaurant.  She <br/>\nused to practice saying  &quot;Roger Rabbit&#39;s buried treasure&quot; while she was working <br/>\non making the &quot;r&quot; because  that phrase has initial/beginning, mid and <br/>\nterminal/end sounds.<br/>\n <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t worry at seven, though.  Offer to help spell the words that  had <br/>\n&quot;r&quot; and maybe (if she thinks it would be fun, otherwise no) maybe make 3x5  <br/>\ncards with the words she has needed to write before and might need to write  <br/>\nagain.  Then she can go to her own words set and find them again for  spelling <br/>\npurposes (and see those r&#39;s).<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2578,"nextTopicId":104013}}
