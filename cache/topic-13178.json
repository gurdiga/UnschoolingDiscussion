Or simply &quot;we homeschool&quot;.   It depends on how chatty I&#39;m <br/>\nfeeling that day.  Now that ds is 12, he fields this question himself.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever got an openly hostile response.  Often startled, but not hostile.  FWIW <br/>\nevery doctor, optometrist, dentist, etc., has asked kids how they like school <br/>\nor some other opening line that gives kid a chance to say he homeschools.  I <br/>\nget the most open support from these professionals.  More than one has made a <br/>\nstatement something like &#39;I wish more families would do that&#39;.  Every one has <br/>\nmade supportive statements.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Eiraul, I sew too.  I am very new to sewing &quot;for real&quot;.

That&#39;s usually when they start <br/>\nasking to do what I&#39;m doing.  I like that these are projects that they can <br/>\naccomplish and that the implements aren&#39;t sharp.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to think pioneers were pretty hard on their kids, having the girls <br/>\nstart embroidering when they were only 5 or 6.  Now I get it!  Those girls <br/>\nwould have been pestering their mommas for something to do anyway, so they <br/>\nmight as well start practicing a skill they would need.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of these days I&#39;m going to learn to spin and weave.  I have wanted to do <br/>\nthat for 30 years, now.  Homeschool is a great excuse to explore this with ds.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, think of all the math and physics lessons that can be picked up from <br/>\nmanipulation of fabric and craft materials.    I count every hour crafting as <br/>\npart of our school time.  Not that I actually keep track, but if anyone <br/>\nshooed ever give me a hard time about it, it&#39;s there to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13176,"nextTopicId":13179}}
