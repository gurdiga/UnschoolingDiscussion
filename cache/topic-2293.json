Jacob made a comment about Adam blaming Eve for his choice to eat the forbidden fruit. It was clear to Jacob that it was Adam&#39;s choice and he had no-one but himself to blame.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt hasn&#39;t been easy to change the way I parent and I have a long way to go and much to learn but today I could see that the kids are learning that with freedom of choice comes taking responsibility for your own decisions. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn all the years I spanked I wanted my kids to take responsibility for their actions and what I was doing, was making it impossible for them to do just that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  At first I felt like talking with them just wasn&#39;t enough, but I see now that it is because each time I respond calmly and encourage them to talk things through instead of spanking them, they have the freedom (because I&#39;m not making them feel bad) to look at themselves and their actions and be responsible. It&#39;s awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt reminds me of that John Holt quote about fear inhibiting learning.
