Unfortunately, we never could afford to.  <br/>\nThis year, we were finally able to make our dream come true.  Our children <br/>\nare 18, 14, 11, and 8.  The oldest two did NOT want to move to the country.  <br/>\nThey are now 1/2 hour away from the church, 3/4 hour away from alot of their <br/>\nfriends and from shopping, parks, swimming pools, theaters etc.  However, my <br/>\nhusband and I talked and prayed about this and decided to go ahead with the <br/>\nmove.  The older kids are only going to be at home for a few more years, but <br/>\nwe will have a lifetime yet and what if this chance only comes once for us?  <br/>\nSo we went ahead and took it.<br/>\n      Guess what?  All the kids love it here now!  They have realised what <br/>\nhaving alot of secluded land of our own can mean.  Now when they go outside <br/>\nduring &quot;schooltime&quot; no one can see them.  We have no more nosey neighbors <br/>\nasking why the kids are out playing.  We have woods behind our home which <br/>\nmakes for alot of &quot;imaginary&quot; play time (even for the 18 year old---he <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t admit it, but he also has fun with it!) and they have been able to <br/>\nmake a tree house.  They are already talking about building an even better <br/>\ntreehouse this summer.  They are out in nature alot any more.  Not only <br/>\nfeeding and caring for our own dog and cat, but we have alot of deer around <br/>\nhere, not to mention rabbits, squirrels, possums, birds, and even snakes.<br/>\n     My husband has a large workshop now and all the kids have been learning <br/>\nto build picnic tables, doghouses, and other wood projects.  The kids have <br/>\nalso helped with repairing mailboxes (ours has been run over twice since we <br/>\nmoved here--in the snowy weather), planting more trees, chopping down trees <br/>\nand chopping firewood.<br/>\nThis spring, they will help us start a garden.  I can&#39;t believe what a <br/>\nturnabout my kids have done!<br/>\n     Of course, we go out of our way to make sure that they still get <br/>\ntogether with their friends, go to scouts, go to the movies, and just stay <br/>\nconnected with their interests.<br/>\nIf this means we have to drive 45 minutes to get them there, we just do it!<br/>\n      As far as listening to everybodys comments about how &quot;selfish&quot; we are, <br/>\nwell I just tell people that I don&#39;t agree.  Most of the people who say that <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want to live in the country.  When I go on and ask them why they <br/>\nfeel that way, they say that they wouldn&#39;t like the seclusion.  So I think <br/>\nthey are going on their feelings, not even thinking that others may not feel <br/>\nthe way they do.  Most of the homeschoolers and other friends that have <br/>\nstayed connected with us since we moved, now think we have done the right <br/>\nthing.  They see how happy and relaxed my kids are, and when they visit us, <br/>\nthey even say that they are jealous and wish they could move in the country!<br/>\n      Personally, I think you should listen to your own heart and dreams.  If <br/>\nthose people are really friends, they will quit criticising you because of <br/>\nyour choice.  After all, you have already bought the land right?  So what <br/>\ngood does their criticising do?<br/>\nDo all their comments make your choices dissapear and you end back up at your <br/>\nold home?  I think not!!  Anyway, this is your life to live, not theirs!  <br/>\nThis is between you, your husband and your kids!  This isn&#39;t really the <br/>\nbusiness of any of your friends.  And if your oldest kids are unhappy, they <br/>\nare really old enough to do something about it arent they?  They are old <br/>\nenough to drive and visit their friends 3/4 hour away.  The oldest one (even <br/>\nthough we wouldn&#39;t like it) is even old enough to get a job and move to their <br/>\nown place!   <br/>\n     Oh well, sorry for rambling, but what you are going through is just the <br/>\nexact thing we went through.  I wish you all the best, and I hope that <br/>\neverything turns out as well for you as it did for us!<br/>\nTami</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sandi Myers","from":"&quot;Sandi Myers&quot; &lt;sdmyers@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"-nNXLIGPHU6iRhJhAC-at7qPCC28oGeXFnf94hWWtMZHIdHZYQxojENvZWobYYwItZ8lUHMhq1bvRwOc5CqZKYPEEXOH3jU","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: old timers / was Definition Please","postDate":"949435668","msgId":6056,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zOTUuNjA1Ni45NTkyNjk3NDZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6050,"nextInTopic":6070,"prevInTime":6055,"nextInTime":6057,"topicId":6050,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I probably fall into the category you have described--we began homeschooling in l979 by taking fifth and third graders out of school and had two younger who","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1332922815\">I probably fall into the category you have described--we began homeschooling<br/>\nin l979 by taking fifth and third graders out of school and had two younger<br/>\nwho never went.  My children are all grown and living their lives<br/>\nindependently and raising unschoolers of their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe made a drastic move in l984 when my husband retired from the Air Force in<br/>\nMississippi and we moved to Oklahoma, out in the country, for his next job.<br/>\nThe kids were 6, 9, 11, and 14.  We had animals so enjoyed the space to<br/>\nraise them differently.  We got involved with soccer for the kids in the<br/>\nsurrounding towns, and  everyone seemed fine.  Our discussions over the<br/>\nyears have shown that it was much more traumatic than I realized for them<br/>\neven though they adjusted okay.  I had tried to keep them aware of all<br/>\nplans, choices, etc during the change, but they still felt they had no<br/>\nchoice.  We had lived in Mississippi for six years and we all had come to<br/>\nlove it.  There was no choice of staying there, but rather where to move,<br/>\nand that choice was basically my husband&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always found life in general to be a balancing act.  Home birth,<br/>\nattachment parenting, homeschooling, all of these things that grow children<br/>\nso well, and have the potential to grow parents well, too, can also be<br/>\ndraining if you don&#39;t find the balance that you need.  My oldest daughter<br/>\nhas a shirt that says &quot;If Mama ain&#39;t happy, ain&#39;t nobody happy!&quot;  And that<br/>\nis true!  So it is important to refill often enough and completely enough to<br/>\nhave something to give when you are called upon and also important to<br/>\nconsider each person&#39;s views and feelings when decisions need to be made.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not start out unschooling.  But my children quickly showed me that<br/>\nthey would accept nothing less--they just would not do what did not<br/>\nabsolutely fit that child at that moment.  So while I was worrying about<br/>\none&#39;s reading and another&#39;s math, what I was turning out was children who<br/>\nhad learned to listen to the person inside and do just what they needed in<br/>\nwhatever way they needed.  Quite liberating, really.  Instead of presuming<br/>\nto know what someone would need to learn or do at what time in the future,<br/>\nyou answer the questions you are asked and help the child who needs help in<br/>\nfinding answers, and strive to be a whole person yourself all the while.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this provides some help in finding the answers you seek!  I would be<br/>\nhappy to discuss it further!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandi Myers<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Are there any other long-term homeschoolers out there? &lt;g&gt; I have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wondered!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lisa Bugg wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There is one thing that we are not doing on this list, we are not<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hearing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; from our long-long term unschoolers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, here&#39;s a question for all you other old-timers!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A friend of mine has two kids - 14 and 10.
