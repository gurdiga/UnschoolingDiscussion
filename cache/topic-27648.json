Take a plastic storage box<br/>\n(like you put toys in), fill it with water & leave it<br/>\nout overnight (or however long it takes to freeze<br/>\nsolid!). When you&#39;re ready to sculpt, take a kettle<br/>\nwith warm to hot (but NOT boiling!) water out and pour<br/>\nover the box (turn it upside down first). The ice<br/>\nblock will pop out (with some pressure on the bottom<br/>\nof the box) and voila you are ready for zee artistic<br/>\nprocess! Clay sculpting tools work great, but we have<br/>\nalso used  swiss army knives, paring knives, ice picks<br/>\n(or nail starters), chisels, saws, hammers, etc (you<br/>\nare only limited by your imagination!). Also you can<br/>\nadd food colouring to the pre-frozen water for a nice<br/>\neffect. Of course, you could always go to the store<br/>\nand buy an ice block, but somehow it takes away some<br/>\nof the fun of it for me. Have fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am looking for some good ideas for playing in &gt;the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>snow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Diana Partington<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFind the one for you at Yahoo!
