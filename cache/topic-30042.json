(It makes me realize why<br/>\npeople get fed up with unschooling nitpicking ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seemed shockingly uncaring to me that MA homeschoolers weren&#39;t supporting<br/>\nthe Bryants but apparently their case is based around their contention that<br/>\nthe compulsory attendance law goes against state constitutionally guaranteed<br/>\nparental rights so the law itself is unconstitutional. There&#39;s a hugely<br/>\nsteep learning curve involved in figuring out what in the world anyone is<br/>\ntalking about in order to try to decide if such a law can be (legally)<br/>\nunconstitutional and if so whether it is and whether that really has<br/>\nanything to do with the legalities of homeschooling in MA. Basically the<br/>\nrallying cry is too muddled to get everyone to answer the call.<br/>\n<br/>\n(The Bryants stance is they don&#39;t have to submit an education plan to be<br/>\napproved by the Superintendent since the compulsory attendance law is<br/>\nunconstitutional. One of the problems that prevents people from rallying<br/>\naround the case is that the education plan is not a much of a hoop to jump<br/>\nthrough (I use Carol Narigon&#39;s which I can pass on if anyone&#39;s interested)<br/>\nand the case law is very clear that the state can&#39;t dictate the manner of<br/>\neducation so unschooling is very easy in MA.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s been a good summary of the two Mass homeschooling points of view on<br/>\nthe case and why the Bryants aren&#39;t being backed universally by<br/>\nhomeschoolers in MA on the MHLA email list. (The second list has had many<br/>\nongoing discussions about it and others.)<br/>\n<br/>\nmasshomelearningassoc at Yahoo Groups (supposedly the MHLA list for<br/>\nnonpolitical homeschooling discussions but a good summary)<br/>\nMAhomeschoolers at Yahoo Groups (the MHLA list for political talk)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether the Bryants have helped the homeschooling atmosphere in Mass as they<br/>\nclaim, or hindered as MHLA claims, apparently no real changes can happen if<br/>\nthe foundation of the changes keeps coming back to the argument of whether<br/>\nto work with what is there (compulsory attendance laws and others) or<br/>\nwhether that&#39;s ridiculous because the laws are unconstitutional. :-/<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scary/sad part is the DSS involvement in what is by-the-legal-book<br/>\neducational neglect and therefore child neglect, but which doesn&#39;t match<br/>\nreality since the kids are clearly being well educated.

The Bryants can&#39;t take their children out of state.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In her decision, White noted that the children have not been abused and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their home life is good.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Bryants yesterday offered DSS area Director Margaret Monnie a lesson<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plan to satisfy White&#39;s court order.

An assistant area director said DSS had just been informed<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the judge&#39;s decision and had not yet assigned a caseworker.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The couple has battled with the School Committee and Waltham School<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Department over home-schooling their children for five years.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The School Department this year filed a Care and Protection complaint<br/>\n&gt; &gt; against the couple because they did not submit a lesson plan for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2000-2001 academic year.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Bryants say no law requires them to do so.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Waltham Assistant City Solicitor Howard Rock agrees that no law requires<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the couple to submit a lesson plan, but he said the School Committee has<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; right to create legal requirements by its own authority.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To date, city attorneys have handled 16 cases related to the Bryants,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; including cases the city has filed against the couple and counterclaims<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the Bryants have filed against the city.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Bryants submitted a lesson plan three years ago when the city went<br/>\n&gt; &gt; through similar measures to have custody of the children turned over to<br/>\n&gt; DSS.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Monnie told the Bryants that DSS would insist on visiting the children<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; home.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But White&#39;s order says &quot;home visits, however, may not be required for<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; approval of a proposed home schooling plan.
