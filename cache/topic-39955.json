My REAL press was that <br/>\nparents WILL spend at least as much time as they used to spend getting kids <br/>\nready for school and transporting them, but it won&#39;t be the same kind of <br/>\npowerless, stressful, at-others&#39;-bidding timespending.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing with a child is powerful.  Not just being in the room while they&#39;re in <br/>\nthe room, or in the house while they&#39;re in the house, but *with* them in what <br/>\nthey&#39;re doing.  Sharing what they&#39;re doing, talking about their thoughts and <br/>\nthe experiences of the day, telling them stories about your own day, month, <br/>\nlife, ideas.  Doing this in a quiet, open-ended way, whether it&#39;s in the car <br/>\nor on the couch or in the back yard pulling weeds or walking to a video store <br/>\nor whatever, I consider that some of the greatest learning time in which I <br/>\nget to participate with my kids.  It beats the heck out of testing and <br/>\nreporting, which separate child from parent, and learning from life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome parents don&#39;t remember to do that, or they&#39;ve forgotten how, or their <br/>\nkids aren&#39;t talkative, or the relationship has gone hard and hostile, or they <br/>\nact teacherly when such opportunities come along.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone doubts that this has been my recommendation in the past, please <br/>\nread the &quot;Leaning on a Truck&quot; article at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/truck\">http://sandradodd.com/truck</a><br/>\nand other articles thereabout<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39954,"nextTopicId":39758}}
