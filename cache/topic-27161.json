And, please, if you are on digest, no rant/attack (been there<br/>\ndone that) about you can&#39;t delete.  You can scroll past.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I do think we should all try to cure one of my very bad habits (bad<br/>\nLynda &lt;g&gt;) and KISS the posts more frequently AND update the subject line.<br/>\nSee, I changed the subject line AND KISSed the post, even someone OAD can<br/>\nlearn new tricks &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DACunefare@...\">DACunefare@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Start a new thread. Don&#39;t read what annoys you. Start talking about what<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re interested in, get other folks interested with you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is the essence of unschooling, for adults and kids too. Don&#39;t tell<br/>\n&gt; people they shouldn&#39;t be interested in something because you aren&#39;t, don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; expect them to do and say exactly what you are interested in doing and<br/>\n&gt; saying. If you want to learn about something, do it. If you want to show<br/>\n&gt; people something wonderful, do it. If you want to stop listening and go<br/>\nread<br/>\n&gt; a book, do it. Don&#39;t drag your kids off from what they&#39;re interested in to<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; what you think is important, and don&#39;t shush adults either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It IS a free country. The framers of our constitution established free<br/>\nspeech<br/>\n&gt; as a right PRECISELY for situations like this, so that no one need ever<br/>\nfear<br/>\n&gt; criticizing their government, it&#39;s actions, or it&#39;s policies. If it truly<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; the greatest nation on earth that is a huge reason why.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m interested in hearing everything folks have to say on all sides of<br/>\nthis,<br/>\n&gt; except I&#39;d like to ask the shushers to please, go ahead and talk about<br/>\n&gt; something else but allow the rest of these folks to talk in peace here<br/>\n&gt; without trying to shut them up. Their opinions can&#39;t hurt you or our<br/>\ncountry.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Deborah </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27112,"nextTopicId":27164}}
