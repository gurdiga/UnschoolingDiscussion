I don&#39;t use that terminology with the kids--we call it <br/>\n&quot;allowance,&quot; but they  have a 75 cents per year of age, per week.  So Holly <br/>\nat 10 gets $7.50.  Kirby, at 15, gets $11.25.  He knows his hourly wage at <br/>\nwork, too, and about how much they take out of it, so when he turns in his <br/>\ntime sheet, he can estimate what his paycheck will be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t teach him that.

I think I understand what you are saying. <br/>\nThe thing I think I see too is that you knew &quot;rate per week&quot; because<br/>\nyour husband is very &quot;math minded&quot; and you have had some exposure. <br/>\nSounds to me like he has a very special &quot;gift&quot; in that area and he&#39;s<br/>\npassed it on to your daughter! LOL<br/>\nGood for them! :O) <br/>\n <br/>\nI personally struggled in math as a student. Not because of the lack of<br/>\nunderstanding the purpose, I was the type that figured, well, If they<br/>\nare teaching it to me then most likely there IS a purpose for it in the<br/>\nfuture I just haven&#39;t come across it and when I do, I&#39;ll be ready. I<br/>\nguess I was easy to get a long with! LOL!<br/>\nI am more &quot;literal&quot; than &quot;mathematical,&quot; I can learn math, but it must<br/>\nbe 3D for me. I also had to learn it in a non-threatening environment,<br/>\nlike Math Lab at the college. I had a great tutor, he looked funny too<br/>\nwith dyed orange hair sticking up fuzzy all over his head! Immediately,<br/>\nbroke the ice! <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, what&#39;s the difference with playing with cards and playing with a<br/>\npencil and paper?<br/>\nMy daughter likes the dry erase board. He do the &quot;smartest kid in the<br/>\nclass.&quot; She made it up.<br/>\nShe made a medallion that she would push toward me if I worked a formula<br/>\nfaster than her. She LOVES that. <br/>\nShe is quite fast too! This isn&#39;t BIG math, just pre-algebra type stuff.<br/>\nBut it&#39;s her game, she made it up, so we do it. :O)<br/>\n <br/>\nBut when we go to Wal-Mart and there is a charge for tax, she understand<br/>\nthe percentage rate, or the surcharge at the commissary and the<br/>\ndifferent rates for food verses non consumables. But she knows it<br/>\nbecause we took the time to investigate it. She can now move on to<br/>\nsomething else.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou or your husband must have invited their attention to the &quot;rate per<br/>\nweek&quot; idea. How many times do we spend or day inviting our children to<br/>\nmoral issues? hygiene issues? social issues and news? Maybe we tug their<br/>\nhearts with &quot;animal rights&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t be a litterbug.&quot; Most children<br/>\ntend to throw trash down on the ground. Not because they intend to harm<br/>\nthe earth at all, but because they had not yet been enlightened to the<br/>\nidea that collectively, throwing down trash is detrimental to the<br/>\nenvironmentÂ…and on goes the teaching to them. We teach them to be<br/>\ncareful when handling the birdie because the bones are so soft and<br/>\ndelicate. My children didn&#39;t automatically understand that birdie bones<br/>\nwhere so much more fragile than their doggie&#39;s. <br/>\nBut I enlightened them to it, I personally told them and went so far as<br/>\nto discuss other bones with them too, using a Gray&#39;s Anatomy book! :O)<br/>\nMy hubby is a Corpsman, we have tons of those things laying around.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m saying in short is that whether we use a pencil and paper or a<br/>\ngame or a video or a book or a natural event, I donÂ’t think that it<br/>\nalways matters. We use common sense right? To decide what the best way<br/>\nto teach math would be. They are acceptable ideasÂ… even the pencil and<br/>\npaper. It too can be acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that making up games or playing games is wonderful.  But I also<br/>\nthink that using a pencil and paper or markers and dry erase is equally<br/>\nwonderful.  I think that there are others here that might agree?<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for letting me share and helping me think through.

Holly is the quickest of any at mental <br/>\nmanipulation of numbers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy grandfather (same one who taught me &#39;to carry&#39;) used to call it <br/>\n&quot;ciphering.&quot;  That refers literally to the marks on the paper--numbers and <br/>\nsymbols representing other concepts.  And that&#39;s an interesting point here.  <br/>\nIn school, math is on paper, because teachers need proof for their bosses, <br/>\nand for the parents, that children &quot;DID math.&quot;  They have the children <br/>\n&quot;cipher.&quot;  But when asked &quot;What is this good for in the real world?&quot;  many <br/>\nteachers told me &quot;you need good test scores,&quot; or &quot;you need to pass this test <br/>\nso you can take chemistry&quot; or some other TOTALLY school-based answer.  They <br/>\nweren&#39;t teaching me math, the greater language of mathematical thinking and t<br/>\nheory and the joy of dancing patterns in everyday life.  They were teaching <br/>\nme to cipher quickly and obediently, and so I decided math was stupid, and I <br/>\nshut that door in me and quit &quot;taking math.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35869,"nextTopicId":35616}}
