I had a really easy maiden name<br/>\nand I used to just have problems with my first name getting spelled right.<br/>\nMy husband however, comes along and sweeps me off me feet, and brings THAT<br/>\nname with him.  It is pronounced (Kirk-end-all) so when people ask me what<br/>\nme name is, I just spell both of them right off the bat, and occassionally<br/>\nsomeone is familiar with the pronounciation of my last name and after I<br/>\nspell it out says &quot;Oh!  &#39;Kirkendall.&#39;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually tell people that my last name has an invisible &quot;R&quot; in it, akin to<br/>\na silent letter.
