I recently went to <br/>\nFoxwoods casino with my mom and sister and I played a table similar <br/>\nto your card game (with 11 or 21).  I can&#39;t wait to play tomorrow <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s one of those fun games you can play with ALL AGES.  I <br/>\ncan&#39;t wait - I even have a bunch of change. We can put the tree up <br/>\nand then gamble all day while learning math LOL................<br/>\nnow thats what I call unschooling.  Oh I forgot my oldest (15) asked <br/>\nme to ear candle his ears so we will get a little health in there <br/>\ntoo.<br/>\nThanks for all your ideas Pam :)<br/>\nSonya</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2152,"nextTopicId":86193}}
