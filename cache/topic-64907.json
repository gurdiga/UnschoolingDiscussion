I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1358936758\">I am in awe of my little girl, who will be 4 in July. There is something <br/>\nabout the age of three. There is no doubt watching her how learning happens. <br/>\nI remember having the same awe about my oldest daughter when she was three, <br/>\nand I sent her to preschool to encourage her brilliance :0(  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe guilt of what I may have done to that exuberance for the world around her <br/>\njust gets me. Getting a second chance to watch my second daughter not be <br/>\ninterfered with is such a blessing. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe does have a 4yo friend who is going off to kindergarten next year and has <br/>\ntold my 3yo. This child&#39;s mother works at home, and still sends her to <br/>\ndaycare a few times a week, or to my house, and she doesn&#39;t even really know <br/>\nme. Her child can spend hours in my house unchecked. She even called me up <br/>\nand offered me a fulltime childcare opportunity &quot;because she heard I was <br/>\nhomeschooling now&quot;. Okay, I won&#39;t go there! <br/>\n<br/>\nBut my 3yo asked a few weeks ago could she go to kindergarten when she is <br/>\n4yo. I said if she wants to, but she doesn&#39;t have to. She can stay home with <br/>\nmommy if she wants. She told me a few days ago she doesn&#39;t want to go to K, <br/>\nshe wants to stay home with me and homeschool. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have never used the word homeschool with her, maybe she picked it up by <br/>\nhearing my oldest and I talk about it. She has been asking for &quot;homework&quot; so <br/>\nshe can homeschool now. She draws me pictures of chickens by tracing her hand <br/>\nand putting a smiley face on the thumb. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just discovered she can write a letter A(her name is Ashlyn). Brings back <br/>\nmemories of when my oldest was almost 4 and could write the letter M(her name <br/>\nis Megan). They both taught themselves. I remember telling Megan M circle M <br/>\nspelled MOM, and she started writing MOM everywhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why Ashlyn changed her mind about kindergarten. Maybe because <br/>\nshe heard Megan, who was deciding to go to 6th grade middle school next fall, <br/>\nabruptly say she was never going back to school and that was that, and she <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t care if I ever mentioned school again. She insists I didn&#39;t <br/>\ninfluence her decision, she just came to her senses. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe said her 6th grader cousin was trying to lure her to school yesterday <br/>\nwith talk of band, dances, lockers, etc. She said she had a comeback for <br/>\neverything the cousin brought up. She said she knows she can get those things <br/>\nwithout school. She sounds much more confident about it than a few weeks ago. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYAY!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAng<br/>\nUnschooling mom to<br/>\nMegan(10) Ashlyn(3) Christian(1.5) <br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/unolist/index.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/unolist/index.html&quot;</a>&gt;UNO Unschoolers Network of Ohio&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.aol.com/megamom08/page1.html&quot;\">http://members.aol.com/megamom08/page1.html&quot;</a>&gt;My Links Page MEGAMOM08&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64883,"nextTopicId":64557}}
