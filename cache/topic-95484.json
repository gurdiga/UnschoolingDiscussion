I just started reading about earthships, &#39;off the grid&#39; houses built from tires and earth. But I think I&#39;ll go for an earth bermed concrete block home (my FIL is a bricklayer and my DH is pratically a journeyman, cheap labour!). The power limitations in a self contained earthship are too much for a family that loves it&#39;s computer, TV, dvd, vcr, etc. :)I&#39;m reading all I can and already thinking that when it comes time to get an architect to customize house plans, maybe I could barter something for his help. This is what unschooling has done to me. It lets me see all the different paths to a goal instead of limiting me to 1 or 2 that I have to nix.<br/>\n  If you see any neat related webites in your studies Kristen, let me know!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] What do you still want to do/learn?","postDate":"1086785575","msgId":95541,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNjA5MTI1MjU1Ljc1OTgzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxNzEyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwN2MwMWM0NGRiYiQwMjE5NDQ5MCRmZWJkYjFkOEB5b3VybzBrd2t3OWp3Yz4="},"prevInTopic":95539,"nextInTopic":95543,"prevInTime":95540,"nextInTime":95542,"topicId":95484,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Some things I want to learn/do: be a lactation consultant to speak Spanish fluently (I learned in high school, but I ve forgotten most of it) to create a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1047527552\">Some things I want to learn/do:<br/>\n<br/>\nbe a lactation consultant<br/>\nto speak Spanish fluently (I learned in high school, but I&#39;ve forgotten most of it)<br/>\nto create a website<br/>\nto write for publication<br/>\nto be a better parent to my children<br/>\ndesign/draft our own home someday<br/>\nsew actual clothes -- not just mending and slings (first I need a machine, I guess)<br/>\ngrow herbs -- maybe for next year&#39;s garden<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure more things will cross my path, and I&#39;m more confident every day that I&#39;ll be able to learn them!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI left school, always an A student, with no desire to be taught anything else.
