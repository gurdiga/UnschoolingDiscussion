My son&#39;s friend told him about an experiment <br/>\n<br/>\nusing bleach and kerosene.  I told him it was too dangerous.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Is this unschooling?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIs telling him it&#39;s too dangerous unschooling?<br/>\nIt&#39;s parenting.<br/>\nIs it the best parenting you could do?<br/>\nI don&#39;t think so.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither do I think buying him some kerosene and handing him the bleach would <br/>\nbe good parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Thanks for the advice.  My son is not interested enough right now to <br/>\n<br/>\ndo the research on his own.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good solution either.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were me, I&#39;d ask the boy who gave him the advice what happens.  If it&#39;s <br/>\na dangerous explosion or toxic gas, or if the answer is &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; I <br/>\nwould tell him not to ever tell anyone else to mix those chemicals again, ever.  <br/>\nIf he seemed receptive, I&#39;d leave it at that.  If he were defiant, I&#39;d talk to <br/>\nhis mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as to finding out what happens, I bet a quick google search would turn up <br/>\nsome interesting information, which you could share with your son, and all <br/>\nwould be happy and positive.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking him look it up is punitive and doesn&#39;t teach joy in research.<br/>\nTelling him &quot;It&#39;s too dangerous&quot; doesn&#39;t teach him anything except &quot;maybe <br/>\nmom&#39;s right, maybe mom&#39;s wrong.&quot;  You don&#39;t want him mixing the chemicals later <br/>\nto see, do you?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Because I told you so&quot; wouldn&#39;t be on my top-200 messages for unschooling <br/>\nparents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that google makes research so easy, I feel about this the same way I feel <br/>\nabout making a kid look a word up instead of just telling him how to spell <br/>\nit, or telling him &quot;it&#39;s in the encyclopedia&quot; if he asks something about history <br/>\nor geography.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s here,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://SandraDodd.com/aradicalthought\">http://SandraDodd.com/aradicalthought</a><br/>\nbut it&#39;s short [quote to the end]:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNever tell a child &quot;Go look it up.&quot; Parents, teachers, friends and <br/>\ncountrymen, how would you like it? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a child wants to know why flowers have a scent, they want someone to say <br/>\n&quot;To attract bees&quot; not &quot;GO LOOK IT UP.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Go look it up&quot; tends to mean &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;I know but I&#39;m not going to <br/>\ntell you.&quot; What&#39;s the advantage of that?<br/>\n<br/>\nEither a child will opt NOT to look it up (and the trust in the parent will <br/>\nerode a little) or he will, under duress, perform this task which might be <br/>\ndifficult for him, or might take so long that he doesn&#39;t care anymore (and the <br/>\ntrust in the parent will erode a little).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m NOT saying to discourage kids from looking things up. I never said not to <br/>\nshow kids how to look things up. I mean don&#39;t treat it like something parents <br/>\nwon&#39;t do, parents don&#39;t have to do, but that kids do, or that kids have to <br/>\ndo, because they are powerless kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nEncyclopedias should be alluring, not forbidding. Dictionaries should be a <br/>\nplayland, not a dark, scary place you dart into for one thing and slam shut <br/>\nbehind you. If you believe they ARE fun, you should look things up in front of <br/>\nyour children, often, and with enthusiasm. That will teach them how to use <br/>\nreference materials, and will make them want to do so, because they will see it as <br/>\nsomething useful and enjoyable that adults do. If you believe dictionaries and <br/>\nencyclopedias ARE dark, scary and forbidding, why on EARTH would you send your <br/>\nchildren there?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96079,"nextTopicId":96082}}
