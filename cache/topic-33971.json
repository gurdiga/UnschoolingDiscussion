I&#39;m actually losing a bit of weight at the same <br/>\ntime.  Your post made me think of the book and I want to suggest it as a <br/>\npossible source to find some REAL sausage recipes without all the junk in it <br/>\nthat processed foods have.  The books is entitled &quot;Nourishing Traditions&quot; and <br/>\nis written by Sally Fallon.  I had no trouble finding a copy of it for him a <br/>\nfew months ago.<br/>\nI hope that this helps your son and anyone else interested in getting away <br/>\nfrom the boxed food stuff that we relied upon before and have found ourselves <br/>\nnot missing at all since moving into more natural foods!<br/>\nKristine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33943,"nextTopicId":33975}}
