The <br/>\ncommandment is, &quot;Children obey your parents IN THE LORD&quot; (key words). This to <br/>\nme says that if we raise our children appropriately, they will obey. There <br/>\nwill be no need for any method to bring about submission, it will occur <br/>\nnaturally. Now also in Ephesians 6:4, it says, &quot;Fathers, do not exasperate <br/>\nyour children...&quot; Again, the assumption there is that if you act in love with <br/>\nthe childs best interest in mind, instead of your own desire for peace or <br/>\ncontrol or what have you, the obedience will follow. They will not have a <br/>\nridiculous list of rules to adhere to but things that make sense, that they <br/>\ncan identify as neccessary.

I imagine we may find other areas of common<br/>\nground but this is not one of them.  Please understand that the<br/>\nfollowing is my opinion, strongly held, based on 50 years of living,<br/>\nyears of schooling and unschooling, and studying human behaviour.  I<br/>\ncould be very mistaken but it is what I honestly<br/>\nbelieve.  Forgive my strong language,<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is extremely difficult for me.  I absolutely equate the Ezzo world<br/>\nview and methodology with the very worst of oppressive, arrogant,<br/>\nadult-centered, power destroying, life-draining cultism.  I know that<br/>\nthere are devout Christian people out there who decry this viewpoint and<br/>\nespouse attachment parenting. Tragically the results of this kind (Ezzo)<br/>\nof child rearing technique are like a time bomb which sometimes explodes<br/>\nin other peoples lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe writings of Alice Miller would be a good choice for people wanting<br/>\nto explore this concept) For Your Own Good specifically.  There is a<br/>\nessay entitled &quot;The Fear of Being Permissive&quot; which is really from a<br/>\nJudeo-Christian perspective which also explores some of these<br/>\nobservations.  I would be happy to email a copy to anyone interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith, I hope that you do not close your ears to what I have to say<br/>\nbecause of the loudness, intensity or perhaps even the abrasiveness of<br/>\nsome of my words.  As deeply as you disagree is certainly as deeply as I<br/>\nbelieve in what I am saying.<br/>\nI am unlikely to convince of my position in any case and in some ways I<br/>\nam speaking to everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAuthoritarian methods engender people who follow authority<br/>\nunquestioningly. Powerful authoritarian figures have historically used<br/>\nthis for their personal power and material gain.  They have used it to<br/>\npromote a wide variety of philosophies and ideologies.  Some are<br/>\nultimately harmless to the world at large and others become a scourge<br/>\nfor all of humanity.  The more power sharing and democratic parenting<br/>\nmethods are, the more independent minded and able to think the children<br/>\nreared in that method are able to become.<br/>\n<br/>\nAuthoritarian methods breed and cultivate unthinking obedience.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t believe it is an easy thing to combine authoritarian methodology<br/>\nand independent thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course many of the people following the Ezzo method are not<br/>\ninterested in independent thinking except to extinguish it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieving the human spirit innately corrupt extinguishing it for the<br/>\ngreater glory poses no problems except for how to achieve that necessary<br/>\n(from their point of view) crushing of independence and<br/>\nself-determination.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately the suffering inflicted on these children echoes down<br/>\nthrough history like an spiritual plague.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have said what I needed to say.
