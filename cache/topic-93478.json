When she was <br/>\n2, I lost my grandmother and my best friend to cancer in a short <br/>\ntime.  She still plays with my friend&#39;s daughter occasially.  When <br/>\nshe was 3 her best friend&#39;s grandmother died in a car crash <br/>\nChristmas eve.  This past summer her great-grandfather, who we saw <br/>\noften, died, as well as my husband&#39;s aunt.  We&#39;ve fielded a lot of <br/>\nquestions and had a lot of conversations.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes she gets worried.  I hold her and try to answer her <br/>\nquestions honestly without provoking fear.  At least once a week <br/>\nshe&#39;ll say, &quot;I&#39;m sad because I miss great-Grandpa.&quot;  I am still not <br/>\nsure I believe in spirits, but when we got to the &quot;some people <br/>\nbelieve&quot; part she liked the spirits.  I told her (which is the <br/>\ntruth) that when I miss my friend I sometimes talk to her spirit.  <br/>\nShe liked that too.  If she asks about children dying, I tell her <br/>\nsometimes it happens.  Sometimes children get sick or hurt and the <br/>\ndoctors can&#39;t make them better, but usually the doctors can make <br/>\nthem better.  There&#39;s a country song about an abused girl who dies, <br/>\nand we heard that one day on the radio.  We talked about that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing, I think, to do for your child is be honest with <br/>\nthem.  If you can&#39;t be honest with them it&#39;s probably best to defer <br/>\nto someone else.  If you&#39;re honest and frank when answering your <br/>\nchild&#39;s questions, it takes some of the dark mysteriousness away. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne day my friend&#39;s daughter was here, after she had died.  Gwen was <br/>\n4, Morgaine was 3.  They were coloring.  I didn&#39;t hear the beginning <br/>\nof the conversations but I heard, &quot;My mommy&#39;s body got very sick and <br/>\nshe had to die.  God wanted her in heaven.&quot;  (They&#39;re <br/>\nCatholic.)  &quot;Yeah, I know that.&quot; &quot;Yeah, sometimes Mommies have to <br/>\ndie.&quot;  &quot;But my Mommy&#39;s not dead!&quot;  &quot;Nope, she&#39;s not.&quot;  And they <br/>\nmoved on to something else.  So simple; that conversation really <br/>\nhelped me talk more frankly w/Morgaine about death.  Just some <br/>\nthoughts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, this year I asked her if she wanted to celebrate El Dia del <br/>\nMuerte; she really liked the idea so we checked out some books on <br/>\nDay of the Dead and left out some little food and gift items for her <br/>\ngrandfather and my friend and others in the family who&#39;ve died.  She <br/>\nliked that a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nKristi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93453,"nextTopicId":93439}}
