It really isn&#39;t entirely the same world as it used to be 30 <br/>\nyears ago when I was enjoying my &quot;freedom&quot;.  When things happen now, <br/>\nthey are a lot more...intense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our town, we have a prison for sexual offenders about 2 miles <br/>\ndown the road.  When they get out, some of them stick around town.  <br/>\nYippee!  I have 3 level 3&#39;s (all child related) living within a one <br/>\nmile radius of my home.  So it&#39;s a very real threat and we are <br/>\ncareful, but try to also keep in mind that our children deserve to <br/>\nlive without irrational fear of the unknown.  It&#39;s hard to balance <br/>\nand I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve made mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 year old is not as interested in exploring for the sake of it <br/>\nas she used to be, she&#39;d rather I drove her somewhere!  Bikes aren&#39;t <br/>\neven an issue with us, my dds don&#39;t really like them and my ds is 7 <br/>\nand happy with the driveway.  But my 10yo dd is very interested in <br/>\nwalking to the store by herself, etc.  I used to let her sister at <br/>\nher age (although I admit I watched secretly with binoculars a few <br/>\ntimes in the beginning), but my younger dd is much more child-like <br/>\nthan my older daughter was, and she tends to panic over things more <br/>\neasily.  So my instinct is that it&#39;s not time yet for her to walk <br/>\nsomewhere by herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I always feel a lot better about is letting either of them <br/>\nwalk around with a. another friend(s) or b. in a public place (no <br/>\nbackstreets, etc.).  Rules like don&#39;t go into the bathroom alone, <br/>\ndon&#39;t go behind buildings, that type of thing.  Cell phone at all <br/>\ntimes.  I find that the girls are pretty comfortable and happy with <br/>\nbeing able to be on their own in stores, malls, movies, amusement <br/>\nparks, etc. and don&#39;t have as much interest in just walking around <br/>\ntown.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;ll have them run into the supermarket, bank, etc. for me <br/>\ninstead of taking in the whole gang.  They really like doing that!  <br/>\nI get a lot of comments from folks, good and bad, mostly very good, <br/>\nabout my 10yo doing the shopping herself.  But she LOVES it and <br/>\nshe&#39;s really good at it and it gives her that sense of freedom(?) or <br/>\nmaturity(?) she is striving for by being alone.  They all ask to do <br/>\nthe store errands now!  And for the record, she shops like a pro..no <br/>\ncarriage mishaps, very polite, calls me about substitutions, asks <br/>\nthe butcher when she can&#39;t find eye of the round (unlike hubby who <br/>\nwill just bring home chuck roast). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe bringing your children someplace that they can test the <br/>\nwaters (like driving them to Walmart and letting them go solo from <br/>\nthe parking lot) is a good place to start, both for you and the <br/>\nchildren?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nCyndi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Intro and ?","postDate":"1113883274","msgId":105440,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjgwMWM1NDQ5NCRmNmQwMWRkMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBob21lPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE5MC4zZTMzZjBlYS4yZjk1YmE2ZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":105437,"nextInTopic":105444,"prevInTime":105439,"nextInTime":105441,"topicId":105402,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Registered just means they have been caught.

If I knew a sex offender lived in  my neighborhood, my <br/>\nkids would be in the company of an adult if they were out  riding their bikes. <br/>\n It&#39;s a known that he is there.  That&#39;s way beyond  my comfort level and I <br/>\nthink you have to decide your own comfort level.   I&#39;d push it with the <br/>\nauthorities to see what rights you do have. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy kids ride bikes close by and my daughter (15) runs a 3 mile loop in our  <br/>\nneighborhood.  It was a process to get there.  We all needed to get  <br/>\ncomfortable  and it started out with us running together.  She still  calls me if she <br/>\ngoes for a run and I&#39;m out doing errands.  She carries a  cell phone.  I check <br/>\nthe sex offender listings...none here right now that  are registered.  It&#39;s <br/>\nwhat works for us.  I think if you are  uncomfortable with them riding their <br/>\nbikes alone knowing he is there, that you  should honor your feelings.  Ride with <br/>\nthem...take them   somewhere else and ride together.  Find other options in <br/>\nyour neighborhood  for now.<br/>\nI think you have a unique situation.

Maybe they just want to GET to Wal-Mart.  Maybe the child would be just as happy to have you drive there.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to increased development resulting in a change in roads in our area, it is now feasible to walk to a Wal-Mart from my house.  There is also a convenience store/gas station within walking distance, but out of the &quot;safety&quot; of the neighborhood.  My 12 yod has been wanting to walk to the convenience store with friends, without me.  A couple weeks ago, my girls and I did the walk together, talking about the things I described above.  Part of the walk has no shoulder on a 2 lane road with 40 mph speed limit.  However, because of the new road diverting much of the traffic, the road with no shoulder is mostly pretty quiet.  Lisa thought it was OK to walk right next to the edge of the pavement when cars come.  I explained to her that although cars are supposed to stay on the road, they may end up on the shoulder for a number of reasons.  We talked about how near/far to the edge was a good amount to stay safe.  There are some houses and a pre-fab housing development along the way. <br/>\n Yesterday, she and her friend walked there together.  Her friend carried a cell phone.  I am not ready to let my 9 yo do the same walk without me.  I have no logical reason - she is very cautious about traffic, etc.  It just doesn&#39;t feel right.  If she asks to walk there with a friend, I will ask if I can go with them.  If they want to feel that they are on their own, I&#39;ll offer to walk a bit behind them, or something.  However, she has not asked to do so.  I need to arrange to walk to Wal-Mart with Lisa sometime soon, to see how feasible that is.  The route that we would walk is not the same way that we would drive there.  It is between 1 and 1 1/2 miles.   In this case, it is that she wants the experience of going somewhere independently.  She knows I would drive her there if her actual goal was to just be there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note about keeping our children safe when we are not with them, I will share an incident that happened here this weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy neighborhood homeowner&#39;s association organized a giant yard sale Saturday morning.  People set up in their own yard, and buyers had the convenience of lots of yard sales all in one neighborhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my neighbors, who is the mother of one of Lisa&#39;s best friends, had a miscommunication with her husband and dd.  The 11 yod and a friend left with the dad while the mom was bathing, but mom had thought the girls would be waiting to go with her.  When she was ready, and couldn&#39;t find the girls, and couldn&#39;t contact her husband on his cell phone, she feared the two girls had been abducted while walking around the neighborhood because of all the increased traffic from the yard sales.  She called here to ask if I&#39;d seen them.  I told her that the girls were too smart to just get in someone&#39;s car, but she feared that perhaps the abductor had a gun.  Story ends well (after she calls the police) when she discovers they were with dad all along and had really thought mom had heard when they said they were leaving with him.  The mom and I talked about it later that day.  She is a teacher and gets to look at the poster of local registered sex offenders every time she goes in the teacher&#39;s<br/>\n lounge and is frightened by it.  Strangers driving around looking for kids is one of my neighbor&#39;s constant fears.  She is always living on the side of fear rather than the side of caution.  Her 11 yod is literally afraid when she sees an unknown car in our neighborhood.  My children do not have this &quot;fear&quot;, because I&#39;ve always approached the idea of &quot;strangers&quot; as how to interact with people we don&#39;t know - not to just blindly avoid them because they may be dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe discussed the incident about Lisa&#39;s friend at dinner last night - Pat, Lisa, Jackie, and I.  I said that it is highly unlikely that they would be abducted by strangers, but I wanted to talk about it since the subject had just come up with one of their friends.  I told Lisa that it is easier for me to let her do things without me if I am confident that she will be able to take care of herself - that she has and will use good judgment about how to react in various scenarios.  I explained that it is my job to keep her safe, that I would be devastated if something did happen, and that if she has children someday, she will understand.  I pointed out that if someone in a car stops and asks the child if they&#39;ve seen their lost pet, it is most likely that they really are looking for their lost pet.  However, it is still good to be cautious, avoid going too close to the car, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had never mentioned gun point before, but did this time, again, because of the incident with the neighbor.  She had feared that her daughter would get in the car if someone had a gun, rather than risk the people shooting her if she ran off.  So I asked my kids what they would do if someone in a car had a gun.  Jackie (9) said she didn&#39;t know.  Lisa wasn&#39;t sure either.  I said that you are always safer to get away from the person with the gun.  Then I said again how unlikely it was to happen, that it had never happened to me or anyone I know.  When I think about it this morning, I see that it really is just adding more detail to what we&#39;ve always told them they should do in a scary situation - just get away.  I&#39;m kind of sorry that I brought it up, because Lisa was visibly upset by the conversation.  OTOH, she spends a lot of time with this other girl and it is likely that the topic will come up in some way when they are together.  I&#39;d rather my dds be aware that these situations<br/>\n are extremely unlikely, and have an idea of how to react, so that if the topic comes up when they are with the neighbor they won&#39;t become paranoid about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

Maybe they just want to GET to Wal-Mart.  Maybe the child would be just as happy to have you drive there.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to increased development resulting in a change in roads in our area, it is now feasible to walk to a Wal-Mart from my house.  There is also a convenience store/gas station within walking distance, but out of the &quot;safety&quot; of the neighborhood.  My 12 yod has been wanting to walk to the convenience store with friends, without me.  A couple weeks ago, my girls and I did the walk together, talking about the things I described above.  Part of the walk has no shoulder on a 2 lane road with 40 mph speed limit.  However, because of the new road diverting much of the traffic, the road with no shoulder is mostly pretty quiet.  Lisa thought it was OK to walk right next to the edge of the pavement when cars come.  I explained to her that although cars are supposed to stay on the road, they may end up on the shoulder for a number of reasons.  We talked about how near/far to the edge was a good amount to stay safe.  There are some houses and a pre-fab housing development along the way.  Yesterday, she and her friend walked there together.  Her friend carried a cell phone.  I am not ready to let my 9 yo do the same walk without me.  I have no logical reason - she is very cautious about traffic, etc.  It just doesn&#39;t feel right.  If she asks to walk there with a friend, I will ask if I can go with them.  If they want to feel that they are on their own, I&#39;ll offer to walk a bit behind them, or something.  However, she has not asked to do so.  I need to arrange to walk to Wal-Mart with Lisa sometime soon, to see how feasible that is.  The route that we would walk is not the same way that we would drive there.  It is between 1 and 1 1/2 miles.   In this case, it is that she wants the experience of going somewhere independently.  She knows I would drive her there if her actual goal was to just be there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note about keeping our children safe when we are not with them, I will share an incident that happened here this weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy neighborhood homeowner&#39;s association organized a giant yard sale Saturday morning.  People set up in their own yard, and buyers had the convenience of lots of yard sales all in one neighborhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my neighbors, who is the mother of one of Lisa&#39;s best friends, had a miscommunication with her husband and dd.  The 11 yod and a friend left with the dad while the mom was bathing, but mom had thought the girls would be waiting to go with her.  When she was ready, and couldn&#39;t find the girls, and couldn&#39;t contact her husband on his cell phone, she feared the two girls had been abducted while walking around the neighborhood because of all the increased traffic from the yard sales.  She called here to ask if I&#39;d seen them.  I told her that the girls were too smart to just get in someone&#39;s car, but she feared that perhaps the abductor had a gun.  Story ends well (after she calls the police) when she discovers they were with dad all along and had really thought mom had heard when they said they were leaving with him.  The mom and I talked about it later that day.  She is a teacher and gets to look at the poster of local registered sex offenders every time she goes in the teacher&#39;s lounge and is frightened by it.  Strangers driving around looking for kids is one of my neighbor&#39;s constant fears.  She is always living on the side of fear rather than the side of caution.  Her 11 yod is literally afraid when she sees an unknown car in our neighborhood.  My children do not have this &quot;fear&quot;, because I&#39;ve always approached the idea of &quot;strangers&quot; as how to interact with people we don&#39;t know - not to just blindly avoid them because they may be dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe discussed the incident about Lisa&#39;s friend at dinner last night - Pat, Lisa, Jackie, and I.  I said that it is highly unlikely that they would be abducted by strangers, but I wanted to talk about it since the subject had just come up with one of their friends.  I told Lisa that it is easier for me to let her do things without me if I am confident that she will be able to take care of herself - that she has and will use good judgment about how to react in various scenarios.  I explained that it is my job to keep her safe, that I would be devastated if something did happen, and that if she has children someday, she will understand.  I pointed out that if someone in a car stops and asks the child if they&#39;ve seen their lost pet, it is most likely that they really are looking for their lost pet.  However, it is still good to be cautious, avoid going too close to the car, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had never mentioned gun point before, but did this time, again, because of the incident with the neighbor.  She had feared that her daughter would get in the car if someone had a gun, rather than risk the people shooting her if she ran off.

Well, I was until I lost my nerve and <br/>\nsent ds to Kindergarten the first year I would have to account for him.  And I <br/>\nonly say &quot;think&quot; because it never had a name before it came time to <br/>\n&quot;homeschool&quot;.  I had always wanted to homeschool and we have been a family of natural <br/>\nlearning since day one.  When it came time to think about the &quot;red tape&quot; <br/>\ninvolved, I lost my nerve.  Then got it back after tons of researching.  When I <br/>\nresearched, I heard the term &quot;unschooler&quot; and I read up on it and realized that it <br/>\ndescribed our home in almost all aspects.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I never understood is, why call in un&quot;school&quot;ing?  It still <br/>\ncontained &quot;school&quot; and that is totally NOT what we do.  Deschool, I get.  Unschool, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t.  That&#39;s just me.  Life learner, natural learner, freethinker-they&#39;re <br/>\nall too wordy, so I guess unschooler works.  I have heard of SOOOO many things <br/>\nsince I began this &quot;labeled&quot; journey.  Before we had a label, it all seemed <br/>\neasier.  When you define yourself, that&#39;s when people ask questions and the <br/>\nstories begin.  Most helpful and enlightening, others not so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor us it boils down to being there for our kids first and foremost.  We help <br/>\nthem find answers to their questions.  We never shhh! or demean something <br/>\nthat is important to them.  Even when I&#39;ve heard about all I can stand of the <br/>\nlatest cartoon craze or whatever has them all in a blur, I bare with it.  This is <br/>\ntheir time and I want for them to be able to do and feel and see and smell <br/>\nand touch and think about whatever pops into their heads.  In the same process <br/>\nwe still have limits or rules.  We are not so loose that the kids would be in <br/>\ndanger or disruptive to others.  We help them make choices, we set examples.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAn example of our &quot;rules&quot;, (never written or set in stone, but used):<br/>\n<br/>\nEating:  Please try everything, but you never have to eat anything you don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to. <br/>\n<br/>\nBathroom things:  We bathe, brush, wash everyday.  We just don&#39;t have a set <br/>\nschedule.  If the kids hang out in pj&#39;s the whole day-cool.  Eventually we will <br/>\nwash up.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleaning up:  We put away our stuff to make room for more stuff.  If said <br/>\nstuff is still being used or we&#39;re coming back later, so be it.  Dishes and <br/>\nthings, when we&#39;re done, we wash.  If we&#39;re in the middle of something then it can <br/>\nwait but if not we do it real quick so there&#39;s lots of time later to do other <br/>\nthings without interruption.  I am needed 24/7 and if I have a ton of dishes <br/>\nor chores, then I&#39;m not as available as they or I like.  So we or I do little <br/>\nbits here and there.  Mine are 7 and 3.5;  they don&#39;t really do chores.  But <br/>\nthey sure do like to help.  They may not when they&#39;re older and figured out it&#39;s <br/>\nwork and not just spashin&#39; in the sink or making baskets with dirty clothes <br/>\ninto the washer.<br/>\n<br/>\nBedtimes:  Pretty loose.  We&#39;ve never had bedtimes.  My youngest says he&#39;s <br/>\ntired or he&#39;ll ask if it&#39;s time for bed yet.  My older one goes in his room when <br/>\nwe go to bed and he reads or draws or plays quietly.  He&#39;s been doing that a <br/>\nlong time and every now and then if I come out, his lights are always out <br/>\nwithin an hour or two.  He gets up on his own as does his brother.  They both know <br/>\nthat we try to have quiet time if others are sleeping.  We do that and they <br/>\ndo that.  We try to be respectful of others.  It&#39;s not a perfect world but it <br/>\nsure is close :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust examples of how I think.  If my 3.5 year old said I am going to Walmart, <br/>\nI&#39;d say hey do you want a ride?  He&#39;d probably giggle and we&#39;d talk about how <br/>\nfar away it is and the dangerous streets and all that jazz.  Would I let <br/>\nhim-hell no!!  Would I talk to him and probably even take him-hell yes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSame with anything.  Sometimes they want to watch something I wouldn&#39;t pick <br/>\nfor them and I&#39;d love to say no but I end up just watching with them or I might <br/>\nsay I don&#39;t think I&#39;d like that and give them some other things to watch or <br/>\nideas to do and if after all that they still want to, then I say go for it-if <br/>\nthey want to that badly then it&#39;s a desire that should be met if it&#39;s not <br/>\nunbelievably drastic.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is unbelievably drastic in my home may be worse in yours or less so.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s the biggest thing of all.  What others do doesn&#39;t have to be what you do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my neighborhood, I don&#39;t let my 7 year old out alone because we have a <br/>\nvery busy street on one side.  He also doesn&#39;t know anyone on our street.  And <br/>\nhe&#39;s actually never asked to go outside.  We are always at parks or activities <br/>\nor museums and such.  If he asked, I&#39;d say yeah and I&#39;d go too.  When I knew he <br/>\nfelt comfortable with the streets and all that, I&#39;d probably let him go <br/>\nalone.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me unschooling means saying yes a lot.  Being there for them.  Opening <br/>\ndoors and/or showing them answers until they can open them or answer them on <br/>\ntheir own.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this got so long, I haven&#39;t posted much lately and I thought I could <br/>\nhelp on this one.  Responding like this helps remind me of things too.  Like <br/>\nwhen I loose my patience or feel overwhelmed or I am in need of a mom-only day.  <br/>\nI can look back and remember what it&#39;s all for.<br/>\n<br/>\nPamela<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"sheila","from":"&quot;sheila&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Intro and ?","postDate":"1113840035","msgId":105416,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjkwMWM1NDQyZiRjMWViNDQ2MCQxNTAyYThjMEBXb3JrR3JvdXA+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUwNDE4MTQzNzI0Ljk3OTQwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMzA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":105413,"nextInTopic":105417,"prevInTime":105415,"nextInTime":105417,"topicId":105402,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you don t set rules,then how do you go about not allowing your children to go about town if you feel they are not mature enough?

She wanted to go out on her bike alone and ride around.<br/>\nAt the time, in that neighborhood, I wasn&#39;t comfortable with it. I explained<br/>\nthat it was my comfort level and not her. With the way she looked at the age<br/>\nof 13, her being rather naive and where we lived, she was only able to ride<br/>\nup and down the block alone. If I couldn&#39;t walk outside and see her down the<br/>\nstreet, I wasn&#39;t comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time she was 14, things changed a lot. We moved and she grew up<br/>\nrather quick. So she was out and about for long walks and bike rides alone.<br/>\nShe also had a cell phone and was always good about keeping in touch with me<br/>\non her own. She&#39;s 19 now and incredibly responsible and careful. She goes<br/>\nout for the whole day taking her 3 younger sisters and brother with her and<br/>\nI never worry one bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 3 younger ones are 10, 9 and 4. They don&#39;t ride bikes because they just<br/>\ndon&#39;t like to. The have scooters but only want to go out and ride them with<br/>\nus walking with them. They love walks but never go out alone. They just<br/>\nnever have asked. They have never been to school and all their friends are<br/>\nhomeschoolers. They are extremely comfortable being around the family and<br/>\ndon&#39;t like being much of anywhere alone. My son (10) even declined on<br/>\nstaying home alone with his dad sleeping in the bedroom and chose to leave<br/>\nwith his grandma instead. He also doesn&#39;t like to stay up after I&#39;ve gone to<br/>\nbed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll 3 of the younger ones always ask before going out in the yard. They<br/>\ngenerally only go out back, which is completely fenced in with a privacy<br/>\nfence. They never just go out. It was a never a rule, it&#39;s just what they<br/>\ndo. Then again, they ask for a drink of water too. It&#39;s just the way they<br/>\nare. Sometimes I wonder why they do ask so much when the answer is never no.<br/>\n(as far as eating and going out) That&#39;s just them. And I&#39;m comfortable with<br/>\nthat. Makes me feel that when they are ready, they will know it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery once in awhile they want to go out front alone. Alone being all 3<br/>\ntogether. They ask, and they never go farther than the front sidewalk.<br/>\nAgain, no rules, just them. So it seems like starting with what is<br/>\ncomfortable and explaining things at a young age has my children not asking<br/>\nfor things that would make me wonder what to do. When we go to one<br/>\nparticular park, where there are lots of woods, the kids all stay together.<br/>\n(with friends) All the kids are very careful to stay around the area and at<br/>\nleast stay with one other person. Us moms joke about how no one would ever<br/>\ncome and take our kids because if they took one, they would have to take<br/>\nthem all!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we go somewhere unfamiliar or large, like a zoo or something, the kids<br/>\nknow to stay close. If they can&#39;t see me, then I can&#39;t see them. That&#39;s<br/>\nsomething I ask of them and there is never any problem with that. So again,<br/>\neach circumstance is handled as it comes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Intro and ?","postDate":"1113838103","msgId":105413,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI3LjU2MWQxMWQyLjJmOTUyYzE3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":105412,"nextInTopic":105416,"prevInTime":105412,"nextInTime":105414,"topicId":105402,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/18/2005 9:10:01 AM Mountain Daylight Time, ptidmore1117@yahoo.com writes: -=-If  you don t set rules,then how do you go about not allowing","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-412156892\">In a message dated 4/18/2005 9:10:01 AM Mountain Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ptidmore1117@...\">ptidmore1117@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-If  you don&#39;t set rules,then how do you go about not allowing your <br/>\nchildren to go  about town if you feel they are not mature enough?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than using broad definitions or proclamations like &quot;you&#39;re not old  <br/>\nenough&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re not mature enough&quot; (condemnations), break it down into the  <br/>\nREAL factors.

(He turned 8 in Oct.) Last summer, he and his cousin (18 mos <br/>\nolder)would walk anywhere that was within 1-2 miles radius. They <br/>\nweren&#39;t allowed to cross any major streets, but luckily that means <br/>\nthey were still able to access several parks, a &quot;corner&quot; store/gas <br/>\nstation, and even a Chinese restaurant. I&#39;m more uncomfortable <br/>\nletting my son explore alone, without his cousin, esp since she <br/>\ntends to be the more cautious &quot;dont break any rules&quot; type, and he is <br/>\nmore fearless. She told me about how he crossed a busy street but <br/>\nshe wouldnt do it because she knew it wasnt allowed. I had to <br/>\nexplain to him more clearly why he needed to stay within the <br/>\nboundaries i set, and not cross the &quot;traffic light&quot; streets. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing i do, that makes me feel tons better, is give my son my <br/>\ncell phone (preprogrammed with our number so he can just hit the <br/>\ncall button)so he can call me if there is any trouble, he is lost, <br/>\nor is too tired and needs a ride home. This actually came in handy <br/>\nwhen my niece cut her toe pretty badly while they were hiking <br/>\nthrough a &quot;trail&quot; (just a woodsy area in the park)...they handled <br/>\nthe situation very calmly, and i was able to bring bandaids, and <br/>\ndrive them home. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in a very safe area, which is relatively crime-free (maybe <br/>\none murder in the past 20 years, and it wasnt random)...however, i <br/>\nstill go over safety issues with my son and what to do if someone <br/>\napproaches him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI dont know how safe the area is where you live, but with kids being <br/>\nkidnapped right out of their bedrooms, it doesnt seem like keeping <br/>\nthem at home is going to necessarily &quot;protect&quot; them. If you live in <br/>\na relatively safe area, i would let them go explore together. And if <br/>\nyou have a cell phone you can loan them for their trips, it would <br/>\nprobably make you feel better that you can call them, or they call <br/>\nyou, if needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112292573,"authorName":"mommuller","from":"&quot;mommuller&quot; &lt;deece@...&gt;","profile":"mommuller","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Intro and ?","postDate":"1113805682","msgId":105402,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQzdmsxaSt1ZGtlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":105403,"prevInTime":105401,"nextInTime":105403,"topicId":105402,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone, I am new here and wanted to introduce myself.
