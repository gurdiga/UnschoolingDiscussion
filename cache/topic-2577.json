We&#39;ve also played some math games on the <br/>\ninternet and maybe he&#39;s picked it up from reading outloud.  a couple <br/>\nmonths ago, we got the book &quot;One guinea pig is not enough&quot; from the <br/>\nlibrary.  it&#39;s a really cute story that incorporates simple math <br/>\nequations into the story.  he read 1 + 1 as 1 plus 1.   another cute <br/>\nstory &quot;bunches and bunches of bunnies&quot; is similiar but multipication. <br/>\n he read 10 X 10 as 10 times 10.   so yes, they do learn to recognize <br/>\nthe math symbols without a math textbook.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; From the unschoolers I&#39;ve known math<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is mostly mental math - which is great - yet I don&#39;t see where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they experience the math sentence and different layouts of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mathematic problems on paper.

Why do some things fit together, others<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t?  Why do some stacks of things balance, others don&#39;t?  Why is<br/>\n&gt; it that if you want to build a lego thing that is twice as tall and<br/>\n&gt; twice as wide and twice as long as the one you have, it takes 8<br/>\n&gt; times as many blocks?
