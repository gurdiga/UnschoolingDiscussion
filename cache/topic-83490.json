Well, one night, my 3 month old ds was upset and <br/>\nS-C-R-E-A-M-E-D for at least 5 or 6 hours straight - it seemed like it was <br/>\nall night.  Jiggling him didn&#39;t help.  Singing didn&#39;t help.  Nursing didn&#39;t <br/>\nhelp.  New nappies didn&#39;t help.  Walkies didn&#39;t help.  &#39;Riding&#39; on the <br/>\ndrier didn&#39;t help.  Nothing, but sustained, never-ending screaming.  Why <br/>\ndidn&#39;t I have a happy baby?  Why couldn&#39;t I get him to stop crying?!!  I <br/>\nbecame more and more frazzled wondering what the neighbors were thinking - <br/>\nwas I beating him?  neglecting him?  That I was a bad mommy &#39;cause he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t a quiet perfect baby?  When was there going to be a knock on the <br/>\ndoor telling me to shut that kid up? It was 2 or 3 in the morning, after <br/>\nall, with at least a dozen people trying to sleep just the other side of <br/>\nds&#39;s window!  I felt awful (and really tired, cranky and depressed) the <br/>\nfollowing morning when the 80+ year old Grandma of this Portuguese family <br/>\nmade a beeline for us on the sidewalk and said, &quot;Oh, so this must the <br/>\nlittle Opera singer I heard through my window last night.  He sang the most <br/>\nbeautiful arias.  What a handsome and strong baby!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI melted.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now, when ever I see a mum who&#39;s about to fry over her screaming kid, I <br/>\ngrin and tell her that her child is a beautiful Opera singer, and how <br/>\nstrong and handsome!  Not every mother gets a child with such healthy lungs!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a slightly un-related note, when there&#39;s a child throwing a fit (without <br/>\nscreaming), I catch the parent&#39;s eye, give a conspiratorial look and say, <br/>\n&quot;I remember those days...  Sometimes you just want to say, &quot;Some people&#39;s <br/>\nchildren!&quot;, eh?  Ah, but I miss them being little like that.  How old is <br/>\nshe?&quot;  &quot;Having a tough day, is she?&quot;  (compliments follow)  Usually, the <br/>\nharried parent&#39;s more worried about what other folks in the store are <br/>\nthinking than about what the kid needs to calm down.  (Plus, it tends to <br/>\ncalm down the other shoppers standing nearby.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, both of these things are &#39;pre-blow-up&#39; and would probably be <br/>\nuseless after a parent&#39;s already lost it.<br/>\nHeidiWD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGet all the fools on your side and you can be elected to anything. - Frank Dane</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Abuse","postDate":"1067746111","msgId":83612,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjMC4xMTBmOTgxZi4yY2Q1ZGQzZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":83609,"nextInTopic":83617,"prevInTime":83611,"nextInTime":83613,"topicId":83490,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/1/03 4:36:47 PM, bstamp@carolina.rr.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1693630579\">In a message dated 11/1/03 4:36:47 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstamp@...\">bstamp@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; My main concern with intervening in such cases is I have often seen <br/>\nparents get angrier by someone&#39;s comments or questions and then the poor children <br/>\nare left with even angrier parents when they get to the car.

That&#39;s just my personality -- I&#39;m not saying this solution <br/>\nis right for all people in all situations.  If I can, I want to use the <br/>\nopportunity to show the parent a way to stop (for the kid&#39;s sake and also for their <br/>\nown sake).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I ask if I can help, I mean just that -- maybe I can help take the <br/>\nstress out of the situation.  Sometimes I can see that an parent is feeling pulled <br/>\ntoo many ways at once (trying to get shopping done, trying to stop the whining <br/>\nof the child, worrying about what they can afford).  I&#39;ve been there, and <br/>\nI&#39;ve felt frazzled by it -- I&#39;ve had to work hard to control myself from yelling. <br/>\n If I can entertain the child for a few minutes so the parent can check the <br/>\nprices on the meat and figure out which one she can afford, then my offer of <br/>\nhelp may work.  It may also model that she can ask for help in similar <br/>\nsituations, or that she can try different approaches with her child to make the <br/>\nsituation better.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s kind of a &quot;It takes a village&quot; approach (though not the Hilary Clinton <br/>\nversion, where the government is the village).  I had to learn these skills -- <br/>\nI think other parents can learn them, too.  I realize that my interaction with <br/>\nthem will not entirely change their parenting style, but it may be a <br/>\nbeginning.  I can hope so, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":63919499,"authorName":"Brian and Kathy Stamp","from":"&quot;Brian and Kathy Stamp&quot; &lt;bstamp@...&gt;","profile":"kathysta","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Abuse","postDate":"1067729624","msgId":83601,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwODUwMWMzYTBkMCQ5NzBkMmE1MCQ0OTc3ODQ0NUB0aGU5b2Z1cz4=","referencesHeader":"PDFhYS4xYmZlMzJjNS4yY2Q1MWJjOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":83600,"nextInTopic":83602,"prevInTime":83600,"nextInTime":83602,"topicId":83490,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My main concern with intervening in such cases is I have often seen parents get angrier by someone s comments or questions and then the poor children are left","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1043841090\">My main concern with intervening in such cases is I have often seen parents get angrier by someone&#39;s comments or questions and then the poor children are left with even angrier parents when they get to the car.

I am shocked at how many parents loose it and in public. I often see <br/>\n  parents walking out the door doing the shake, smack, nag shake thing. Sometimes <br/>\n  I have said &quot;what a bitch&quot; in passing and other times I say HEY knock that <br/>\n  off!  Sometimes a look is all it takes. What bothers me is if they do it in <br/>\n  public what is happening at home? <br/>\n<br/>\n  When I was 21-22 and a single Mom I lived in a 10 building small housing <br/>\n  project. There was a rough looking family with a son that had ADD and some other <br/>\n  concerns (so the parents said). I would be at the clothes line and would hear <br/>\n  bang,slap,slap,slap Ouch no Mommy no! followed by more slaps. I wasn&#39;t positive <br/>\n  of what was happening and didn&#39;t want to jump the gun so when I herd it again <br/>\n  I walked up to their door.  After talking to the Mom I walked back to my <br/>\n  apartment and called and reported them. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I saw her at Wally&#39;s (no wonder money is tight) last month.

What bothers me is if they do it in <br/>\npublic what is happening at home? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 21-22 and a single Mom I lived in a 10 building small housing <br/>\nproject. There was a rough looking family with a son that had ADD and some other <br/>\nconcerns (so the parents said). I would be at the clothes line and would hear <br/>\nbang,slap,slap,slap Ouch no Mommy no! followed by more slaps. I wasn&#39;t positive <br/>\nof what was happening and didn&#39;t want to jump the gun so when I herd it again <br/>\nI walked up to their door.  After talking to the Mom I walked back to my <br/>\napartment and called and reported them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI saw her at Wally&#39;s (no wonder money is tight) last month. She told me they <br/>\nfinally took him away after he walked into court with shorts and dirty clothes <br/>\nduring the winter. He is 15 now.  So at least ten years of abuse went by and <br/>\nno one did anything. She told me he needed to go she couldn&#39;t handle him. I <br/>\nwas sick listening to her.

Of course<br/>\n  &gt; the limitation is that if a word is spelled wrongly in context, but is<br/>\n  &gt; still a real word, the checker misses it.

Both my husband and I were just born<br/>\n  with it and I have yet to meet a person who is a good speller and wasn&#39;t<br/>\n  born to it. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; My son (14) is improving on his spelling.  Spelling tests in school always<br/>\n  frustrated him.  No matter how hard/long he&#39;d study, he&#39;d still be lucky to<br/>\n  earn a passing grade. He wouldn&#39;t remember how to spell those words the next<br/>\n  week.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; The ONLY thing (and we tried lots of things) that&#39;s worked for him is to<br/>\n  learn the words as he uses them.  Not an arbitrary set that he&#39;s supposed to<br/>\n  know.  He plays Tribes online and frequently asks how to spell whatever word<br/>\n  he&#39;s having trouble with.

Or that he<br/>\n  &gt; complained about stylized camera work that was so evidently deliberate<br/>\n  &gt; and planned. A tidbit about the film is that the actor portraying Fran&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt; father was the Spanish National flamenco champion or some similar title.<br/>\n  &gt; His dancing is cool. The film is full of some of the grand actors of<br/>\n  &gt; their generation in Australia. I once designed costumes for a play with<br/>\n  &gt; Pat Thomson. She was a wonderful raconteur and world traveler,<br/>\n  &gt; entertaining all of us during rehearsals, as well as really good in the<br/>\n  &gt; show. Paul Mercurio is the son of a well known (Australian) character<br/>\n  &gt; actor Gus Mercurio. When I was working wardrobe on &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; in Sydney in the early eighties, it was rumored that Paul had been<br/>\n  &gt; slated to take over the part of the son (the &quot;juvenile&quot; as it is called<br/>\n  &gt; in musical theater), which was played by Gerry Sont (an old friend of<br/>\n  &gt; mine from high school, now a soap star in Australia). It didn&#39;t happen<br/>\n  &gt; at the time, although the dancing required for that particular character<br/>\n  &gt; was incidental, unlike the Cagelles, who had some pretty big and fancy<br/>\n  &gt; dancing.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Robyn Coburn<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Message: 11<br/>\n  &gt;    Date: Fri, 31 Oct 2003 06:17:21 EST<br/>\n  &gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Halo5964@...\">Halo5964@...</a><br/>\n  &gt; Subject: spanking<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; No one would consider it acceptable if I spanked, yanked or swatted an<br/>\n  &gt; elderly parent in my care.<br/>\n  &gt; No one would think it was ok if I spanked or swatted a coworker, doctor,<br/>\n  &gt; teacher, or bus driver if they were not behaving the way I liked.<br/>\n  &gt; No one would think it was ok if a man turned his wife over his knee in<br/>\n  &gt; Wal-mart and let her have it.<br/>\n  &gt; That&#39;s abuse.

Of course<br/>\n&gt; the limitation is that if a word is spelled wrongly in context, but is<br/>\n&gt; still a real word, the checker misses it. The only time misspelling<br/>\n&gt; bothers me in casual writing is when the meaning becomes unclear, or<br/>\n&gt; causes me to have to puzzle it out - but hey!

After four or fives times of my spelling it for<br/>\nhim, he owns the word.  His writing of stories has also provided painless<br/>\npractice and improvement.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Andy told me just the other day that spelling is *much* easier when<br/>\ntyping.

Or that he<br/>\n&gt; complained about stylized camera work that was so evidently deliberate<br/>\n&gt; and planned. A tidbit about the film is that the actor portraying Fran&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; father was the Spanish National flamenco champion or some similar title.<br/>\n&gt; His dancing is cool. The film is full of some of the grand actors of<br/>\n&gt; their generation in Australia. I once designed costumes for a play with<br/>\n&gt; Pat Thomson. She was a wonderful raconteur and world traveler,<br/>\n&gt; entertaining all of us during rehearsals, as well as really good in the<br/>\n&gt; show. Paul Mercurio is the son of a well known (Australian) character<br/>\n&gt; actor Gus Mercurio. When I was working wardrobe on &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;<br/>\n&gt; in Sydney in the early eighties, it was rumored that Paul had been<br/>\n&gt; slated to take over the part of the son (the &quot;juvenile&quot; as it is called<br/>\n&gt; in musical theater), which was played by Gerry Sont (an old friend of<br/>\n&gt; mine from high school, now a soap star in Australia). It didn&#39;t happen<br/>\n&gt; at the time, although the dancing required for that particular character<br/>\n&gt; was incidental, unlike the Cagelles, who had some pretty big and fancy<br/>\n&gt; dancing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Robyn Coburn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 11<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Fri, 31 Oct 2003 06:17:21 EST<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Halo5964@...\">Halo5964@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: spanking<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No one would consider it acceptable if I spanked, yanked or swatted an<br/>\n&gt; elderly parent in my care.<br/>\n&gt; No one would think it was ok if I spanked or swatted a coworker, doctor,<br/>\n&gt; teacher, or bus driver if they were not behaving the way I liked.<br/>\n&gt; No one would think it was ok if a man turned his wife over his knee in<br/>\n&gt; Wal-mart and let her have it.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s abuse.
