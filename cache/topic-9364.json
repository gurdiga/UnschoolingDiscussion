We use<br/>\nit every year when we go on vacation with my in-laws.  It worked better when<br/>\nwe were in student housing because we used the metal king-sized frame to put<br/>\nthe twin sets on, that seemed to help hold them together and the egg crate<br/>\nmattress provided some extra padding for me (the lucky one in the middle).<br/>\nWhen on vacation we just push the two twin beds together and the extra<br/>\nsideboards keep it from staying together well.<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9359,"nextTopicId":9368}}
