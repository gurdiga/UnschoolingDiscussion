I&#39;ve always seen <br/>\nhomeschooling as a spectrum, from school-at-home to unschooling.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nsee unschooling as a spectrum, though, but I guess I&#39;d say that there&#39;s a <br/>\nspectrum of &quot;moving toward unschooling&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do believe there is a place here for anyone who wants to learn more about <br/>\nunschooling.  I also think that when someone shows by their posts that they <br/>\ndon&#39;t quite &quot;get&quot; how important giving up control is, that they will be <br/>\nquestioned.  (I hope not criticized.)  I know how hard it can be to give up <br/>\ncontrol, but I don&#39;t think people can really &quot;get&quot; unschooling until they <br/>\ndo.

But the phrase &quot;teaching at home&quot; tends to ring alarm <br/>\nbells in the unschooler.  It&#39;s not that we never teach.  I&#39;ll teach my son <br/>\nhow to use a dictionary or how to look stuff up in the phone book . . . . . <br/>\n. . . if he asks or indicates in some way that he hasn&#39;t been able to <br/>\nfigure it out.
