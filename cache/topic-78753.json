We as parents can&#39;t help <br/>\n  but influence our children who live with us 24/7. Children naturally <br/>\n  soak up the environment that is around them (if that environment is a <br/>\n  passive one; children who are forced into participating in their <br/>\n  parents&#39; passions have been known to rebel, LOL). My bookcase doesn&#39;t <br/>\n  have a single Shakespeare book (sorry folks!), but I&#39;ve got lots of <br/>\n  Persian poetry books. I also am more likely to be playing Turkish <br/>\n  folk music around the house rather than Western Classical music. My <br/>\n  husband is a big video gamer who plays almost every night, and <br/>\n  recently got the kids their own system as well. When the kids were <br/>\n  too young to choose for themselves, I was the one who picked out <br/>\n  books and toys to buy for them and decided what videos and TV shows <br/>\n  to switch on for them, and I made a conscious decision to never ever <br/>\n  switch on Barney because I couldn&#39;t stand that big purple dork, LOL. <br/>\n<br/>\n  All of these things that we as parents do are influencing our young <br/>\n  children&#39;s tastes. But what do you do about that? Short of buying one <br/>\n  of every type of book or rotating through every single musical style <br/>\n  or switching the TV to another channel every 10 minutes or whatever, <br/>\n  there&#39;s no way you have the time to personally expose your child to <br/>\n  every single possibility out there. <br/>\n<br/>\n  In addition to that old standby the public library, we are very lucky <br/>\n  to now also have television and computers so that kids can expose <br/>\n  themselves to a wide range of information outside of their parents&#39; <br/>\n  relatively narrow interests. The problem arises when parents limit or <br/>\n  censor their children&#39;s reading, watching, and playing based upon <br/>\n  those personal preferences. That&#39;s where the unschooling kicks in I <br/>\n  suppose--I&#39;m not going to stop my kid from reading whatever he wants, <br/>\n  or listening to whatever music he wants, or even switching on Barney <br/>\n  if that&#39;s what he really wants to do (ugh!). I can&#39;t help but <br/>\n  passively influence my child with my interests, but I don&#39;t think it <br/>\n  becomes blatant coercion unless I actively push my interests on him <br/>\n  and prevent him from branching out and pursuing his own interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Cheers,<br/>\n  Deniz <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I think more <br/>\nhomeschoolers will become unschoolers.  Why research a bunch of stuff that the kids&#39; <br/>\nare not interested in, or buy curriculum, when the kid can get online and get <br/>\nhis fill of lots of interesting stuff he wants to know?  Or, the parent can pull <br/>\nlots of stuff from the net and have it around, that they find when they&#39;re <br/>\nsurfing.  I send Alex about 3 links a day to his email.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo worries about the parent knowing nothing about a certain subject, the kid <br/>\ncan find what he needs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s silly to decide for the kid what he should know, because the kids have <br/>\nmuch more of a pulse of what&#39;s new and needed in modern society, and they, <br/>\nalmost effortlessly, learn that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son was interested in learning Japanese, pulled up a bunch of websites, <br/>\ntold me all this stuff I never knew, and he did that in about two hours on line. <br/>\n Lots of kids are interested in Japanese because of YuGiOh cards and video <br/>\ngames.  Can&#39;t take Japanese until high school because it&#39;s &quot;too hard&quot;.  But it&#39;s <br/>\nridiculous to make the kids wait if they&#39;re interested at 8 or 9 years old.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWatched Big Trouble last nite, people kept spitting out wierd, but useful, <br/>\nfacts, all learned from the Discovery Channel.  lol <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you&#39;re right, as long as you&#39;re not limiting exposure to these <br/>\ntechnologies, they will find what they&#39;re looking for, and be exposed to new things that <br/>\nparents know nothing about.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am learning French and Spanish, for example, and have no interest in <br/>\nJapanese, at all.  But that doesn&#39;t seem to be making a dent in his interest in <br/>\nJapanese.

Isn&#39;t that better unschooling?  <br/>\nIs it passive coersion to leave around Shakespeare but no chemistry books ( <br/>\nto use Sandra&#39;s post as just an example) ?  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can be ready and willing to offer anything and ask questions, and go out <br/>\nto the store or library to get whatever you don&#39;t have, but is that the same <br/>\nas having them around?  Tough questions.  I know I have much more fiction in <br/>\nthe rest of the house, and all the sciency stuff I&#39;m not much interested in is <br/>\nonly on my husband&#39;s shelves and my kid&#39;s room.  I don&#39;t know what I think <br/>\nabout that, now, hehehehe.  Maybe I should clean less? lol<br/>\n<br/>\n*hmmmm*  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Aimee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95531212,"authorName":"Michael Soguero","from":"&quot;Michael Soguero&quot; &lt;Michael_Soguero@...&gt;","profile":"michael_soguero","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"adult assistance was What is Unschooling?","postDate":"1060824340","msgId":78753,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PExhdzEwLUY5N1owc3RncjNTVTAwMDA0ZTljZEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":78861,"prevInTime":78752,"nextInTime":78754,"topicId":78753,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I do not read assistance to be equivalent to arguing for lessons & curriculum.

Some sort of interaction with others seems to be important to <br/>\nthe learning process whether it is the asking of authentic questions (rather <br/>\nthan contrived &quot;guess what&#39;s in my head&quot; questions) or trying a particular <br/>\n&quot;strategy.&quot; I put strategy in quotes because it may be laden with too many <br/>\nnegative connotations for some.  I simply mean, for example, deciding to use <br/>\nparticular vocabulary in one&#39;s interaction with a child believing that they <br/>\nmight pick up on that vocabulary (they may not and that&#39;s okay too but no <br/>\nharm in trying).  Would this be anti-unschooling as some define it?  Is this <br/>\nassistance? Does it really matter what it is called?
