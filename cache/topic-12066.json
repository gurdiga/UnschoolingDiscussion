V <br/>\ninteresting.  It was very moving, at the end, as one woman came <br/>\nforward and told us she&#39;d had a mammogram 9 years before, and <br/>\nhad tried to stop wearing her prosthesis two years ago.  She had <br/>\nnever known why it was such a big problem for her, but after the <br/>\ntalk, she did.  The focus in our culture on the breast is amazing!  <br/>\nBreast implants were compared to fiit-binding, which was a really <br/>\ninteresting way to ook at things.  And it&#39;s funny how topics <br/>\nconverge, but on another list, a vitriolc discussion of religion has <br/>\nturned, slowly, to a commentary on repression of women!
