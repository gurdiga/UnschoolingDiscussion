His<br/>\n&gt; &gt; placement counselor assured me that he would be a good, reliable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; busboy.  But I had never had a mentally handicapped employee and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t sure I wanted one.  I wasn&#39;t sure how my customers would react<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to Stevie.  He was short, a little dumpy, with the smooth facial<br/>\n&gt; &gt; features and thick tongued speech of Down syndrome.  I wasn&#39;t worried<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about most of my trucker customers, because truckers don&#39;t generally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; care who buses tables as long as the meatloaf platter is good and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pies are homemade.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The four-wheeler drivers were the ones who concerned me; the mouthy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; college kids traveling to school; the yuppie snobs who secretly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; polish their silverware with their napkins for fear of catching some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dreaded &quot;truckstop germ;&quot; the pairs of white shirted business men on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expense accounts who think every truckstop waitress wants to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; flirted with.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I knew those people would be uncomfortable around Stevie, so I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; closely watched him for the first few weeks. I shouldn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worried.  After the first week, Stevie had my staff wrapped around<br/>\n&gt; &gt; his stubby little finger, and within a month my truck regulars had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; adopted him as their official truckstop mascot. After that I really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t care what the rest of the customers thought of him.  He was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like a 21- year-old in blue jeans and Nikes, eager to laugh and eager<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to please, but fierce in his attention to his duties.  Every salt and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pepper shaker was exactly in its place, not a bread crumb or coffee<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spill was visible, when Stevie got done with the table.  Our only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; problem was persuading him to wait to clean a table until after the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; customers were finished.  He would hover in the background, shifting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; his weight from one foot to the other, scanning the dining room until<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a table was empty.  Then he would scurry to the empty table and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; carefully bus the dishes and glasses onto the cart and meticulously<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wipe the table up with a practiced flourish of his rag.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If he thought a customer was watching, his brow would pucker with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; added concentration.  He took pride in doing his job exactly right,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and you had to love how hard he tried to please each and every person<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he met.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Over time, we learned that he lived with his mother, a widow who was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disabled after repeated surgeries for cancer.  They lived on their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Social Security benefits in public housing two miles from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; truckstop.  Their social worker, who stopped to check on him every so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; often, admitted they had fallen between the cracks. Money was tight,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and what I paid him was probably the difference between them being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; able to live together and Stevie being sent to a group home.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why the restaurant was a gloomy place that morning last<br/>\n&gt; &gt; August, the first morning in three years that Stevie missed work.  He<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester getting a new valve or something<br/>\n&gt; &gt; put in his heart.  His social worker said that people with Down<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Syndrome often had heart problems at an early age, so this wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unexpected, and there was a good chance he would come through the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; surgery in good shape and be back at work in a few months.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A ripple of excitement ran through the staff later that morning when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; word came that he was out of surgery, in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; recovery and doing fine.  Frannie, my head waitress, let out a war<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hoop and did a little dance in the aisle when she heard the good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; news.  Belle Ringer, one of our regular trucker customers, stared at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the sight of the 50-year-old grandmother of four doing a victory<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shimmy beside his table.  Frannie blushed, smoothed her apron and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shot Belle Ringer a withering look.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He grinned.  &quot;OK, Frannie, what was that all about?&quot; he asked.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We just got word that Stevie is out of surgery and going to be okay.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I was wondering where he was.  I had a new joke to tell him.  What<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was the surgery about?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Frannie quickly told Belle Ringer and the other two drivers sitting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at his booth about Stevie&#39;s surgery, then sighed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m glad he is going to be OK,&quot; she said, &quot;but I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; how he and his mom are going to handle all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bills.  From what I hear, they re barely getting by as it is.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Belle Ringer nodded thoughtfully, and Frannie hurried off to wait on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the rest of her tables.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since I hadn&#39;t had time to round up a busboy to replace Stevie, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really didn&#39;t want to replace him, the girls were busing their own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tables that day until we decided what to do.  After the morning rush,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Frannie walked into my office.  She had a couple of paper napkins in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her hand a funny look on her face.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; I asked.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I didn&#39;t get that table where Belle Ringer and his friends were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sitting cleared off right after they left, and Pony<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Pete and Tony Tipper were sitting there when I got back to clean it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; off,&quot; she said, &quot;this was folded and tucked under a coffee cup.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She handed the napkin to me, and three $20 bills fell onto my desk<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when I opened it.  On the outside, in big, bold letters, was printed,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Something For Stevie&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Pony Pete asked me what that was all about,&quot; she said, &quot;so I told<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him about Stevie and his mom and everything, and Pete looked at Tony<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and Tony looked at Pete, and they ended up giving me this.&quot;  She<br/>\n&gt; &gt; handed me another paper napkin that had &quot;Something For Stevie&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scrawled on it&#39;s outside.  Two $50 bills were tucked within its folds.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Frannie looked at me with wet, shiny eyes, shook her head and said<br/>\n&gt; &gt; simply, &quot;Truckers!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That was three months ago.  Today is Thanksgiving, the first day<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Stevie is supposed to be back to work.  His placement worker said<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he&#39;d been counting the days until the doctor said he could work, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it didn&#39;t matter at all that it was a holiday.  He called 10 times in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the past week, making sure we knew he was coming, fearful that we had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forgotten him or that his job was in jeopardy.  I arranged to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; his mother bring him to work, met them in the parking lot and invited<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them both in to celebrate his day back.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Stevie was thinner and paler, but couldn&#39;t stop grinning as he pushed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; through the doors and headed for the back room where his apron and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; busing cart were waiting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hold up there, Stevie, not so fast,&quot; I said.  I took him and his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mother by their arms.  &quot;Work can wait for a few minutes.  To<br/>\n&gt; &gt; celebrate your coming back, breakfast for you and your mother is on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I led them toward a large corner booth at the rear of the room. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could feel and hear the rest of the staff following behind as we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; marched through the dining room.  Glancing over my shoulder, I saw<br/>\n&gt; &gt; booth after booth of grinning truckers empty and join the procession.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We stopped in front of the big table.  Its surface was covered with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; coffee cups, saucers and dinner plates, all sitting slightly crooked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on dozens of folded paper napkins.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;First thing you have to do, Stevie, is clean up this mess,&quot; I said.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I tried to sound stern.  Stevie looked at me, and then at his mother,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then pulled out one of the napkins.  It had &quot;Something for Stevie&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; printed on the outside.  As he picked it up, two $10 bills fell onto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the table.  Stevie stared at the money, then at all the napkins<br/>\n&gt; &gt; peeking from beneath the tableware, each with his name printed or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scrawled on it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I turned to his mother.  &quot;There&#39;s more than $10,000 in cash and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; checks on that table, all from truckers and trucking companies that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; heard about your problems.  Happy Thanksgiving!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well, it got real noisy about that time, with everybody hollering and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shouting, and there were a few tears, as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But you know what&#39;s funny?  While everybody else was busy shaking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hands and hugging each other, Stevie, with a big, big smile on his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; face, was busy clearing all the cups and dishes from the table.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Best worker I ever hired.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ************************************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Coming together is a beginning;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keeping together is progress;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; working together is success.&quot; - Henry Ford, Sr.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"kExqoQ4W2oPv2Iw4dxzOs-krQd3WKLm0U9W4NoBhdryqeLybgl2whFWEO4s8vCL9PynaT1WGL5wp3L0q7kTToZ4oHQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Fw: Something For Stevie","postDate":"976118172","msgId":14385,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjgwMWMwNWY5ZCQ5NDIxN2EyMCQzNDVkZDFkMUBsZGlvbm5vPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14389,"prevInTime":14384,"nextInTime":14386,"topicId":14385,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Tear warning!

I arranged to have<br/>\n&gt; his mother bring him to work, met them in the parking lot and invited<br/>\n&gt; them both in to celebrate his day back.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Stevie was thinner and paler, but couldn&#39;t stop grinning as he pushed<br/>\n&gt; through the doors and headed for the back room where his apron and<br/>\n&gt; busing cart were waiting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Hold up there, Stevie, not so fast,&quot; I said.  I took him and his<br/>\n&gt; mother by their arms.  &quot;Work can wait for a few minutes.  To<br/>\n&gt; celebrate your coming back, breakfast for you and your mother is on<br/>\n&gt; me.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I led them toward a large corner booth at the rear of the room. I<br/>\n&gt; could feel and hear the rest of the staff following behind as we<br/>\n&gt; marched through the dining room.  Glancing over my shoulder, I saw<br/>\n&gt; booth after booth of grinning truckers empty and join the procession.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We stopped in front of the big table.  Its surface was covered with<br/>\n&gt; coffee cups, saucers and dinner plates, all sitting slightly crooked<br/>\n&gt; on dozens of folded paper napkins.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;First thing you have to do, Stevie, is clean up this mess,&quot; I said.<br/>\n&gt; I tried to sound stern.  Stevie looked at me, and then at his mother,<br/>\n&gt; then pulled out one of the napkins.  It had &quot;Something for Stevie&quot;<br/>\n&gt; printed on the outside.  As he picked it up, two $10 bills fell onto<br/>\n&gt; the table.  Stevie stared at the money, then at all the napkins<br/>\n&gt; peeking from beneath the tableware, each with his name printed or<br/>\n&gt; scrawled on it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I turned to his mother.  &quot;There&#39;s more than $10,000 in cash and<br/>\n&gt; checks on that table, all from truckers and trucking companies that<br/>\n&gt; heard about your problems.  Happy Thanksgiving!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, it got real noisy about that time, with everybody hollering and<br/>\n&gt; shouting, and there were a few tears, as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But you know what&#39;s funny?  While everybody else was busy shaking<br/>\n&gt; hands and hugging each other, Stevie, with a big, big smile on his<br/>\n&gt; face, was busy clearing all the cups and dishes from the table.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Best worker I ever hired.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ************************************************<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Coming together is a beginning;<br/>\n&gt; keeping together is progress;<br/>\n&gt; working together is success.&quot; - Henry Ford, Sr. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14388,"nextTopicId":14390}}
