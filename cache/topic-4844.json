Taking it slow is the quickest way to greater enjoyment!<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Britannica.com website of the day:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; The Slow Food International Movement **<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.slowfood.com/main.html\">http://www.slowfood.com/main.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Holiday feasts serve as an island of bonhomie in an ocean of<br/>\n&gt; hustle-bustle. Food and wine critic Carlo Petrini worries that such<br/>\n&gt; opportunities for celebrating flavor and camaraderie have become<br/>\n&gt; rare. Petrini pins the blame, in part, on America&#39;s obsession with<br/>\n&gt; fast foods. In fact, he founded the Slow Food movement in 1986 in<br/>\n&gt; response to the incursion of fast food restaurants into Italy. Now<br/>\n&gt; an international organization with 60,000 members in 35 countries,<br/>\n&gt; Slow Food works to &quot;counteract the fast food virus by defending<br/>\n&gt; local food traditions and by reconditioning our collective<br/>\n&gt; gastronomic consciousness.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The group champions a number of gustatory causes, such as defending<br/>\n&gt; the biodiversity of crops and livestock and protecting the<br/>\n&gt; historical heritage and practices of small-scale dining <br/>\n&gt; establishments. Their &quot;Ark of Taste&quot; project attempts to discover,<br/>\n&gt; catalog, and distribute regional and forgotten flavors. The group&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; quarterly magazine, &quot;Slow,&quot; offers musings on matters of taste,<br/>\n&gt; pleasure, and the habits of the movement&#39;s mascot, the contemplative<br/>\n&gt; snail. As its U.S. director Patrick Martins says, &quot;We&#39;re trying to<br/>\n&gt; bring the ethic of Thanksgiving into everyday life, not necessarily<br/>\n&gt; eating that much or fighting with your parents, but sitting,<br/>\n&gt; talking, and creating ritual more than once or twice a year.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; --Jessica Clark<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---------------------<br/>\n&gt; Number of &quot;professionally trained home economists and <br/>\n&gt; nutritionists&quot; available for Butterball&#39;s &quot;Turkey Talk-Line&quot; <br/>\n&gt; in 1999: 48<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Number of calls this line has received since 1981: 2.3 million<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Length of time a turkey had been frozen after which a man called to<br/>\n&gt; ask if the &quot;fabled fowl&quot; was safe to eat: 30 years<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Butterball.com]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---------------------<br/>\n&gt; Number of onions called for in &quot;Mama Stamberg&#39;s Cranberry Relish<br/>\n&gt; Recipe&quot;: 1<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Amount of horseradish called for in this recipe: 2 tablespoons<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;And remember, it&#39;s the recipe that SOUNDS terrible, but TASTES<br/>\n&gt; terrific!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; --Susan Stamberg, NPR Special Correspondent<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [NPR Online]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---------------------<br/>\n&gt; Site of the Day | Britannica.com | Edited by Jo Rosenbohm<br/>\n&gt; Send comments to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:newsletters@...\">newsletters@...</a>.<br/>\n&gt; Explore Britannica.com at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.britannica.com\">http://www.britannica.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Explore Society at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.britannica.com/society.\">http://www.britannica.com/society.</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---------------------<br/>\n&gt; Britannica.com is a free knowledge and learning center for people <br/>\n&gt; who seek thoughtful and engaging context to today&#39;s affairs.
