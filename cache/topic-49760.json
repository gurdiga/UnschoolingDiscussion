I took piano for several years, but could never hear if what I was doing was right. Instead, I got used to the feel of where my fingers were on the keys.... kinda like how I can type without looking at the screen or my keyboard and just *know* when I type something wrong. I think it would be much easier to be able to hear if you&#39;re doing it right or wrong. My piano teacher used to fuss at me all the time because I couldn&#39;t hear my mistakes. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: Stephanie Elms <br/>\n  You know...I think that being able to play music by ear is so much <br/>\n  more important (not sure if that is the right word, but it is the only<br/>\n  one coming to me right now) then reading music.
