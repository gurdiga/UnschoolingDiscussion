Florida Unschoolers is one I know <br/>\nand trust.   But deciding between these two legal ways of complying with FL&#39;s <br/>\ncompulsory education law involves more than just cost or the annual <br/>\nevaluation. For a comparison between the options, you can check out <br/>\nwww.ParentDirectedEducation.org and follow the links. <br/>\n<br/>\n       I&#39;ve been comfortable for many years with the evaluation option as a <br/>\nhome educator, and my website co-owner uses the private school umbrella option <br/>\nand helps others do the same. Either one can be great, depending on how it <br/>\nfits your own family -- PDE doesn&#39;t recommend one over the other.
