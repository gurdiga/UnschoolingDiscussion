Her mom refused <br/>\nto have her in the kitchen AT ALL. The first time she&#39;d ever cooked anything <br/>\nwe were in our early teens at my house; we made breakfast (bacon, eggs, <br/>\ngrits, etc.). She was AMAZED at how cooking &quot;happened&quot;. I can still see her <br/>\nface! A year later, my dad taught her how to make and flip crepes---she was <br/>\nthrilled!<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember making breakfast when I was six---burnt toast and VERY crisp bacon <br/>\nand eggs with surely undrinkable coffee---for my parents as <br/>\n&quot;breakfast-in-bed&quot; with no assistance. They smiled as they forced down every <br/>\nbite.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also remember almost burning down the kitchen making homemade french fries <br/>\n(cut up potatoes and deep fried!) when no one was at home (I was seven!). <br/>\nLuckily a neighbor was available to put out the fire!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no fear in the kitchen. Not everything is palatable &lt;G&gt;, but it&#39;s <br/>\nalways fun! I hope my boys feel the same way!<br/>\n<br/>\nCaroline now eats out most meals or her husband cooks.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38904,"nextTopicId":38918}}
