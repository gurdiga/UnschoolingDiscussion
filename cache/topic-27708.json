I didn&#39;t think that my son would have asthma (the eczema mostly comes from his dad&#39;s side), didn&#39;t give him the medication he was prescribed at 6 months because I had been warned by a nurse that given ventilin causes the lungs to depend on ventilin.  I didn&#39;t smoke, didn&#39;t expose him to smoke or other typical allergens, and live in a city that is very dry, has very low asthma rates.  None of this stopped my son from having asthma.  As it&#39;s been said, stress will exacerbate an attack (if my son has already been wheezing, and he gets in trouble, it will turn into a full blown attack), but the causes of both asthma and eczema are extremely complex. <br/>\n<br/>\nAllison<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:carenkh@...\">carenkh@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 4:34 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: asthma and stress<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yep -- a study confirming my own experience.

Two excerpts and then a comment:<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------<br/>\nChronically-stressed children are far more likely to have asthma attacks than <br/>\nless-stressed children, experts have found. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe link between stressful lives and wheeziness could result from damage to <br/>\nthe immune system, they say. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe research, carried out at the University of Helsinki in Finland, is <br/>\npublished in the Lancet medical journal. <br/>\n<br/>\nStress has already been blamed in adults for contributing to heart disease <br/>\nand even cancer and in children to appendicitis or rheumatoid arthritis. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even the children of excessively anxious parents have been found to be <br/>\nmore likely to develop asthma. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe researchers followed a group of asthma 90 child patients in Glasgow, aged <br/>\nbetween six and 13 for 18 months, noting when they had attacks, and finding <br/>\nout about the stressful events in their lives. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------<br/>\n<br/>\nA small but growing body of evidence points to a relationship between <br/>\npsychosocial stress and the early onset of asthma in children who have a <br/>\ngenetic predisposition to the disease. Specifically, clinical judgment of <br/>\n&quot;early parenting difficulties&quot; has been found to be a significant predictor <br/>\nfor the development of asthma among genetically at-risk children. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe W.T. Grant Foundation Asthma Risk Study was designed to prospectively <br/>\nexamine children who were considered to be at a genetically increased risk of <br/>\ndeveloping asthma. Since the longitudinal study began in 1985, researchers <br/>\nhave monitored both physiological and psychological factors among 150 <br/>\nfamilies with the intent of identifying risk factors for illness expression. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------<br/>\n<br/>\nStress doesn&#39;t cause asthma from nothing, there&#39;s genetic pre-disposition and <br/>\noften allergies make it worse, but stress clearly makes it worse, and I think <br/>\nmaking a BIG deal about controlling (i.e. changing a child&#39;s life and <br/>\nlimiting it severely in honor of his asthma) is stress all in and of itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27790,"nextTopicId":27903}}
