I was busy that week and not around much.  The<br/>\nwoman I work with has reservations about this HS thing so she was watching<br/>\nhim pretty closly, thinking that he has to be missing something important<br/>\nand how will he ever learn to get along with other kids.  So after the week<br/>\nshe tells me she was really concerned about him because he didn&#39;t come in<br/>\nand talk to her like the other kids.  I say so what was he doing and she<br/>\nsays well he spent all his time with Zach (one of his PS friends)  I say so<br/>\ndid Zach come in and talk to you? Well, no.  so does that make you think<br/>\nthere is something &quot;wrong&quot; with Zach?  Well, no - but that&#39;s different.<br/>\n(Hmm - Why?)<br/>\nSo I told her that They really hadn&#39;t had much time together this summer and<br/>\nthey were just enjoying each other&#39;s company. And if Zach hadn&#39;t been there<br/>\nI was sure he would have made friends with some other kids, (because he has<br/>\nin similar situations) but he just didn&#39;t need to with Zach around. Seemed<br/>\nlike pretty independant behavior to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe really amazing thing was there was another boy their same age that they<br/>\ntried to interact with.  His mother was along for the week and he was a real<br/>\npain, hanging on her, arguing about where they were going to sit on the bus,<br/>\nwanting all of her attention, etc and not interacting with the other kids at<br/>\nall - but no one questioned his behavior.  (Except his mom - he was making<br/>\nher crazy)  I can only imagine what the response would have been had I gone<br/>\nalong and my DS had acted like that.  I wonder why people set up different<br/>\nstandards for homeschooled kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else experienced anything like that?<br/>\n<br/>\nBecky in Ohio</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2807,"nextTopicId":2868}}
