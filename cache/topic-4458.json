Stop there. Instead of discenting the need for<br/>\nmath, dissect the panic.  Where does it come from.  Who made you so afraid<br/>\nof *math needing to be learned*.  What are you afraid of? That she will<br/>\nNEVER do math, just because she didn&#39;t do it in the last month? Did you<br/>\nstudy economics last month?  What if the y2kers are right and we&#39;re going to<br/>\nslide in a deep, deep, depression in the next few years? Will you understand<br/>\nthe market forces at work?   In essence I&#39;m asking *why do we panic*?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We made fraction wheels out of pizza cardboard rounds and had great fun<br/>\n&gt; making them but there they lay.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s GREAT.  You had fun and she was working with you! No telling what she<br/>\nabsorbed from the time with you and working with fractions.  Did you two<br/>\ntalk about fractions?  Hey you should have ordered the pizza and eaten it AS<br/>\nfractions. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the other day I took out the math books<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; again and started in the chapters on fractions - trying to make this<br/>\n&gt; interesting and meaningful.  I&#39;ve scaled it back to no more than 15<br/>\n&gt; problems in a day but still sense her boredom, frustration and general<br/>\n&gt; dislike of the topic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Did she ask you to do this?  Is she whining that she doesn&#39;t know fractions?<br/>\nI have one that whined about fractions.  At 12 we were under a lot of stress<br/>\nwith a court case. Dang thing last 18 months and we were a bunch of crispy<br/>\ncritters by the time it was over.  We didn&#39;t even attempt doing anything<br/>\nacademic during that time.  Well, at 14 my daughter was standing in my<br/>\nkitchen whining... you should have made me learn fractions. -------((( My<br/>\nhead is spinning, I&#39;m thinking when you frist approached fractions we were<br/>\nliving a nightmare, with 3 babies under 4 to go with it.....I would have<br/>\nsent you around the bend if I had *made* you learn fractions--so now what to<br/>\nsay))))<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she said... &quot;don&#39;t you know there are some things you just have to do,<br/>\neven if you don&#39;t like it.&quot;.. Hoo Boy, this was worth waiting for.  Yes, she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know fractions when other kids did... she was 14 and way<br/>\n*behind* ---But you know what, that lesson that there are some things you<br/>\njust have to do because you just have to, that lesson will carry her much,<br/>\nmuch farther than knowing fractions 2 years eariler.  So, I looked up at<br/>\nher, and said, &quot;you know Sara, I was teaching... I was helping you learn<br/>\nsomething.  Do you realize how many people come out of forced schooling and<br/>\nnever really know you have to do something because you just have to *for<br/>\nyourself*. They&#39;ve spent years doing things because they had no choice and<br/>\nwhen they do have  choice they stop learning.  Now, you know deep inside<br/>\nthat it&#39;s worth it to work hard at something you don&#39;t really like, PLUS in<br/>\n6 weeks worth of effort you&#39;ll know fractions too.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe struggled to say something.  I recieved one of those looks parents of<br/>\nteens are used to when they figur out you&#39;re right, but hate to admit it.<br/>\nShe walked off and I ordered Keys to Fractions.  She worked through them and<br/>\nto this day, hates fractions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Help!  How can I ignore this???

If it&#39;s truly in every possible<br/>\nthing we do, how in the world could she just right it off??? How?  How would<br/>\nshe function, managing her checkbook, her auto insurance, cutting a pizza up<br/>\nfor her children??<br/>\n<br/>\n In ways she wants me to tell her what to do (still thinking I should do<br/>\nwhat the school did)  and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; yet, she resents it when I push even a little.  Ack!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How do you know this?  It sort of looks like you think she ought to be doing<br/>\n*school math*. That she ought to sit down with fractional parts of a piece<br/>\nof cardboard instead of the frational parts of the PIZZA? The real fractions<br/>\nare in dividing a pizza, not the cardboard.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe wants your help learning to function in the world, which will include<br/>\nusing fractions.  Build things, make a bird house.   Cook, hide the one cup<br/>\nand one teaspon and use the others.  Or agree only to use the 1/4 teaspoon<br/>\nin the things you make.. or double a recipe.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you can choose not to panic and wait until she needs to use this skill,<br/>\nwhich will be learned much, much easier when there is a true need.  Even if<br/>\nit&#39;s much later than school says it should be learned.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"The O&#39;Donnells","from":"The O&#39;Donnells &lt;praxis@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"jheWhwBckaLZLrbkywY96HR-EuI_kkArGQtQA_TUSSDEjyoTr0lbcwtsl6huYLPNcCFfdwL-Gz-u8m1VPK_nvhjgyes-c088Dw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Fwd: Math","postDate":"942415839","msgId":4458,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yOTQuNDQ1OC45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4462,"prevInTime":4457,"nextInTime":4459,"topicId":4458,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"OK guys,  I m getting paniky here.
