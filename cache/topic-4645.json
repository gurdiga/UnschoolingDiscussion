Healing from public school does take a<br/>\nmore proactive stance sometimes.  The method used to explain any given<br/>\nsubject just might not have been the best one for a specific child and they<br/>\nare left with thinking it&#39;s all about them, not the school, that is the<br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not think he would have never touched math, as I don&#39;t think that&#39;s<br/>\npossible, but there is a blending thing that must go on.

Once was very early on, she had missed some interpersonal<br/>\ncues and embarrassed herself in class, she just didn&#39;t want to go in the<br/>\ndoor the next day.  I did a fairly good job of being an authoritarian parent<br/>\nthat day.  The second time was after a car accident and hit hurt like all<br/>\nget out to go to class.  This was not about KARATE, this was about HER.  She<br/>\ndid not have to go back in order to learn karate, there were tons of other<br/>\noptions available, this was about her own personal growth, her own strength<br/>\nof character.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a hard thing we do sometimes, this unschooling/parenting thing.

These are all people who<br/>\nthe teachers turned their backs on to pay attention to the good students<br/>\n(who weren&#39;t there to waste their time).

The point being, she is no longer ashamed to use her math<br/>\nskills. She has made leaps and bounds in the last two years and loves<br/>\ngeometry.
