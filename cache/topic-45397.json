More often than not, they sleep on <br/>\nthe floor in my room.  My 9 y.o. daughter is usually on the floor right next <br/>\nto my bed; she likes to hold my hand as she falls asleep.  I don&#39;t have a <br/>\nproblem with this.  Physical affection is a very real need, whether you are <br/>\ntwo years old or 20-I know that if they&#39;re getting these needs met by me and <br/>\nmy husband, they won&#39;t be looking to have them met somewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always gotten grief from others about &#39;holding my kids too much&#39;-more <br/>\nwhen they were little-but *I* know that I&#39;m doing the right thing.  Plus, I <br/>\nlike it, too!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bedtime problems do get better.  Bedtimes were a nightmare when they <br/>\nwere little, partly because I worked evenings, but over the years I <br/>\ndeveloped the attitude that as long as they didn&#39;t disrupt *my* sleep, (In <br/>\nother words, as long as they aren&#39;t tossing and turning and hogging the <br/>\ncovers!) they were welcome in my bed, or on the floor.  We&#39;ve tried every <br/>\narrangement imaginable-mattresses on the floor, cots, etc.  Now they just <br/>\nbring in their sleeping bags.  I&#39;m planning to get the biggest king-sized <br/>\nbed I can find, now that they&#39;re bigger.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m, frankly, happy that my 11 y.o. ds wants to be in my room; he likes to <br/>\ncome in and read at night while I&#39;m watching tv or reading.  Other kids his <br/>\nage are getting into girls, and we all know how young some kids are starting <br/>\nto have sex.  I&#39;m not about to turn him away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some nights when my husband and I tell them to sleep somewhere <br/>\nelse, and they&#39;re usually OK with that.  I think back to my child psych <br/>\nclass, and how infants and toddlers need to develop trust; I think the same <br/>\nis true of older kids.  When they need (or want) us, and we turn them away, <br/>\nhow are they supposed to trust us?  Or trust their own feelings, for that <br/>\nmatter?<br/>\n<br/>\nTroy<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] older kids needing mom to get to sleep","postDate":"1033823675","msgId":45418,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDA1LjA3MzAwMS4xMjQwLjIuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":45401,"nextInTopic":45426,"prevInTime":45417,"nextInTime":45419,"topicId":45397,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Wow!
