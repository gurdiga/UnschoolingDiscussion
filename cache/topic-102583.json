Too much <br/>\ngood wood goes to the dump, while people are paying money  for firewood.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow we have a wood-fired hot tub in addition to the fireplace, and it&#39;s  <br/>\nCOLD, and I&#39;m thinking I should just go by myself (since the boys are driving  and <br/>\nthey often drive Holly around now) and just look for wood sometimes.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s also exercise and a good &quot;explore&quot; sometimes.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe hot tub itself has been a good new toy that I&#39;ve played with a lot,  <br/>\nfiguring out how most efficiently to heat it, and how best to drain it and  all.  <br/>\nWater play and pyromania combined, with a good soak pretty  often!  And <br/>\nthere&#39;s a tactical/physics element.  It&#39;s winter and the  hose will freeze if we <br/>\nleave it attached and don&#39;t drain it, but if three people  use the tub there&#39;s <br/>\ntoo much displacement to keep 3&quot; over the stove, so if the  stove is already <br/>\ncool that&#39;s fine, but if it has a fire in it, more water has to  be added.  We <br/>\nhave 20 full & closed gallon millk jugs we can chuck in,  but that only replaces <br/>\na person and a half or so.  It&#39;s been a fun  puzzle.  Holly&#39;s been in the <br/>\nmost, of the kids, but yesterday Marty (on his  16th birthday) sat out with his <br/>\ndad and me for half and hour in the late  afternoon, and it was a sweet time we <br/>\ncan all look back on in years to  come.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe kids and  I have shared music back and forth, and humor (movies,  <br/>\ncomedians on recordings or video, musical parodies, websites,  books).   The kids <br/>\nturned me on to Eddie Izzard, I offered them things  I had of Bill Cosby and <br/>\nGeorge Carlin.  For Christmas I got Marty some  cassette tapes, cheap, of older <br/>\ncomedy because he has that interest and is  driving a car without a CD player.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s loving some old Eddie  Murphy.  He knows Eddie Murphy as a famous <br/>\nprotective father, actor in  kids&#39; movies, Dr. Doolittle, cartoon voices.  This stuff <br/>\nfrom when he  was young and childless and wild is surprisingly crass, and so <br/>\nseeing his  career backwards is fun for Marty.<br/>\n <br/>\nYour kids can kind of be your main hobby, but if you can learn to just be a  <br/>\nsupport figure in their projects and interests and spend some time making  <br/>\nyourself a better &quot;librarian&quot; or resource person you might find some of your own  <br/>\ninterests through theirs.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77669557,"authorName":"gailbrocop@aol.com","from":"gailbrocop@...","profile":"gailbrocop","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Schedules, routines, and other beginner questions","postDate":"1105800503","msgId":102616,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1Yi40ODZlNDMxYS4yZjFhODczN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":102605,"nextInTopic":102621,"prevInTime":102615,"nextInTime":102617,"topicId":102583,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/14/2005 8:24:55 P.M.

Here&#39;s something I wrote fairly recently on another list<br/>\nthat still applies to Jayn.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong Quote begins:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;This &quot;what to do about our youngster hitting out and kicking us&quot; is one<br/>\nof the *big* issues related to the children that are these young ages. I<br/>\noften find it a real struggle. So this is going to be a bit of an essay.<br/>\nJust thinking about my answer I have had a couple of revelations about Jayn,<br/>\nso thanks for asking. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two different types of unpleasant hitting behavior - towards other<br/>\nkids, and towards Mom and Dad. They have different motivations behind them,<br/>\nand I act differently for each.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first step in this for me was to make a commitment to not spanking or<br/>\npunishing. I did this before Jayn was born. She has never had a time out,<br/>\nalthough she sometimes takes herself off to the other room if she wants a<br/>\nmoment to calm herself. My commitment reminds me to stop and breathe at<br/>\nthose times when it just seems impossible - and presto it isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout two years ago, when I still allowed Jayn to play at my neighbors&#39;<br/>\nhome, I got a call from their mother. Jayn had apparently kicked Jonah, a<br/>\nboy her age, while all three children were left alone in the kids&#39; bedroom<br/>\nto play. His mother was upset because Jayn would not apologize to Jonah, but<br/>\nhad evidently made no effort to get to the cause of the event, or to comfort<br/>\nJonah who was *still* crying (more in hurt pride not actual hurt body) by<br/>\nthe time I got down the hall to their apartment. <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn was doing a kind of skipping around song to herself, which I recognize<br/>\nas avoidance/denial behavior. It is not that she is really callous; it is<br/>\nthat she had no tools for how to act in the situation when the other adult<br/>\nwas making a demand that she didn&#39;t want to comply with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIgnoring the woman, who just kept repeating, &quot;She won&#39;t apologize, she won&#39;t<br/>\napologize&quot;, in favor of dealing with the more urgent situation, I got down<br/>\non the floor close to Jonah and held his hand, gently pulled Jayn to me in<br/>\none arm, and asked him if he was hurt, and to tell me what had happened. I<br/>\nlistened for a few minutes while he calmed down and told me that Jayn had<br/>\nkicked him and how it had hurt, and Jayn in my arm did also. I apologized on<br/>\nher behalf, and then gave him a hug. All this time, Renee just kept playing<br/>\nherself. At no time did she contribute anything to the story of what had<br/>\nactually happened. At the end of this Jayn and Jonah hugged, and she said<br/>\nsomething about not kicking in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then took Jayn off home, and I asked why she had wanted to kick Jonah. She<br/>\nwasn&#39;t ready to tell me until a little later, when she explained that Jonah<br/>\nhad come over and knocked over the girls&#39; little town. We talked about some<br/>\nalternative courses of action next time someone was doing something that was<br/>\nbothering her, or interrupting her play: using her words, inviting Jonah to<br/>\nplay, getting a grown up to help. It was clear to me that Jonah was<br/>\nresenting being left out of the game and having his space invaded, and so<br/>\ndisrupted their game. I suspect he was afraid that if it came out that he<br/>\nhad provoked the kick, he would at best lose all sympathy and at worst be<br/>\npunished himself. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis kind of physically supporting Jayn&#39;s emotions (with my arm around her)<br/>\nwhile not condoning her actions and acting to comfort and apologize to the<br/>\ninjured other party has been the model of what I do in any event where Jayn<br/>\nis unpleasant to another child. Sometimes I remind her that sand is<br/>\ndangerous if it gets in someone&#39;s eyes. I usually have taken her away to<br/>\nspeak to her privately about her actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis last action has become more problematic for me recently, as it is<br/>\nstarting to fall under the purview of an idea that I have been thinking and<br/>\nwriting about a lot recently - that our children don&#39;t need us to elucidate<br/>\ntheir mistakes for them, or try to ensure that they have learnt something<br/>\nfrom them (they will anyway). <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn has been resenting/rejecting me wanting to point out her bad behavior<br/>\nto her. She resists listening to me go on about how she shouldn&#39;t throw a<br/>\ntoy at someone. She already knows it. On these rare occasions, her judgment<br/>\nis overcome by a moment of annoyance, or possibly a desire to conduct an<br/>\nexperiment into the usefulness of whacking someone. My solution to this has<br/>\nbecome to focus more on comforting the other person, mirroring back their<br/>\nemotions, and apologizing on her behalf. Jayn can sense my concern, and is<br/>\nstarting to say sorry spontaneously. She is now more likely to talk about<br/>\nwhy she did it and what she could do instead at a *much* later time, like<br/>\nwhen cuddling on the sofa later in the evening, rather than immediately<br/>\nafter the event.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of Jayn hitting or kicking me or dh, there seem to be several<br/>\nreasons for it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first one is when she is trying to distract me from speaking to her<br/>\nseriously about something she is doing that really should stop. Sometimes it<br/>\nmeans I am being long winded about it. Usually I protect my face by grabbing<br/>\nher hands and *completely ignore* the hitting. In other words I refuse to be<br/>\ndistracted from my mission to stop her from whatever discourteous behavior<br/>\nshe is engaged in. Recently it was continuing to splash a child in the pool<br/>\nwho didn&#39;t wish to play a splashing game. When Jayn realizes her ploy won&#39;t<br/>\nwork she usually becomes calm and listens (I try to be brief) and then will<br/>\nagree to another course of action that either she or I devise.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jayn was kicking and hitting (then laughing) dh a lot recently, we<br/>\ndivined that it was because she was missing him while he was at work, and<br/>\nwanted more of his undivided attention for a while in the evenings. She<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have the words or grasp of her emotions to explain her resentment. Dh<br/>\nand she had a conversation on a walk, after I suggested to him that this<br/>\nmight be the reason for her pushing away behaviors. They came up with a plan<br/>\nfor them to spend time playing their games together, and he agreed to make<br/>\nher his first priority. It has worked really well. I&#39;m feeling like the hit<br/>\nand laugh action is more on this theme - wanting attention or the chance to<br/>\nbe close. I continue to suggest other ways to express those desires to Jayn,<br/>\nlike to say, &quot;I need your attention.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third reason for hitting out is just plain overwhelmed with emotion.<br/>\nJayn is very articulate and loquacious, but she still is just a little one.<br/>\nShe sometimes just can&#39;t find the words to adequately express that she is<br/>\ntired, frustrated, irritated or disappointed. Even adults sometimes have<br/>\ntrouble doing that! She has meltdowns, but the good news is that they are<br/>\ngetting fewer. Usually my first goal is self-protection - I push away her<br/>\nhands from my face, or hold up my arms in front. I tell her forcefully to<br/>\ntake some deep breaths. I sometimes will hold her briefly. I am reluctant to<br/>\ndo so too much after reading Jan Hunt&#39;s &quot;The Dangers of Holding Therapy&quot; at<br/>\nwww.naturalchild.org .<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I feel anger I try to breathe and speak about it - which is what I want<br/>\nto model for her. If I want to hit her, which does still sometimes come up<br/>\n(which is why I *need* that stated commitment), I often try blowing a<br/>\nraspberry on her instead. Walking away sometimes is possible, but usually<br/>\nshe will follow. I do repeat, &quot;No hitting/biting people&quot; and sometimes<br/>\nsuggest she thump the chair or bite a pillow instead. This last action<br/>\nsometimes turns into a game with some giggles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big thing is to try and remember that it will pass as she ages, that she<br/>\nis often mirroring my emotional state, that the good thing behind this is<br/>\nthat she has no fear of us. When she is at her most obnoxious is also her<br/>\nmost vulnerable and needy.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I&#39;ve been struggling with this issue for probably <br/>\nthe past year. I believe in this philosophy, BUT I have issues with the <br/>\ndiscipline side. HOW do I teach my child to make his own choices, while AT <br/>\nTHE SAME TIME discouraging undesirable behavior?  I&#39;d *like* to let him do <br/>\nwhatever he wants, but what about when he does things that are just not <br/>\nacceptable, for example hitting or yelling at me? This is our big issue now <br/>\nand, while it may not exactly equate to TV watching, I still think the idea <br/>\nis the same. So do I let him hit me and bark orders at me for two years <br/>\nuntil the marginal utility of this behavior comes down? No.  I guess what I <br/>\nam asking all of you for advice on is - how do you curb an undesirable <br/>\nbehavior *without* punishment/restriction?  (And before anyone brings it <br/>\nup, there is never *any* hitting in this family, so he is not learning it <br/>\nfrom us. I am very loose with discipline and it is suggested by many <br/>\nfriends and family members that *I* am the reason he acts this way - <br/>\nbecause I am not strict enough. Typical.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Do or do not.
