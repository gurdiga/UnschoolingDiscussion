I refuse to cook in a messy kitchen.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m almost allergic to it.  I feel confused and totally agitated.  I like<br/>\n&gt; spotless counters and sinks.  But that is another trait of a melancholy person:<br/>\n&gt; perfectionism. :-)  Thank God I am not a total perfectionist.  I, personally,<br/>\n&gt; would probably scar my children for life!  (No offense if someone reading this<br/>\n&gt; is!!!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s funny but I am part melancholy and part sanguine, which is an unlikely<br/>\n&gt; combo.  I am an outgoing, emotional perfectionist.  :-0  And my son is the same.<br/>\n&gt; Only he is opposite!  He&#39;s a sanguine-melancholy.  With me the emotional,<br/>\n&gt; introverted, perfectionist is stronger than the outgoing, happy-go-lucky,<br/>\n&gt; draw-attention-to-herself, fun girl.  My son is just the opposite.   If you have<br/>\n&gt; no idea what I am talking about, go get the book &#39;Spirit-Controlled Temperment&#39;<br/>\n&gt; by Tim LaHaye.   It&#39;s a great book that explains it all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Living for Him,<br/>\n&gt; Faith<br/>\n&gt; Love is doing the highest good for the object of your love.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MORELFAM@...\">MORELFAM@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MORELFAM@...\">MORELFAM@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i most love to get creative or ambitious in the kitchen after<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it has been cleaned spotless!
