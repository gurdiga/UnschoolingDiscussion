Both<br/>\n                     boys when young tried<br/>\n                     girl stuff like makeup, barbies, even using<br/>\n                     balloons to show off a pair<br/>\n                     of boobs. Glad you are dancing to your own<br/>\n                     music. I know I would not<br/>\n                     purchase a bra for my son at any age, nor let<br/>\n                     him wear it in public.<br/>\n                     No judgement bashing here from me, I just haven&#39;t<br/>\nheard this one.<br/>\n<br/>\n                     Linda***<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think our lives are about our children choosing what they want,<br/>\nnot us choosing it for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have talked with Robin about things that might be said to him if he<br/>\nwears his bra in public, but he feels as if he could handle any of it.<br/>\nMind you we support his decision to be who he is, so we are there to<br/>\nhelp with any negative stuff he gets.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis best friend Connor makes fun of him sometimes, for wearing the bra,<br/>\nfor having a Barbie, you name it - if his father said it&#39;s girl stuff,<br/>\nConnor will make fun of a boy with it.  But I did see him once trying<br/>\nthe bra on and I have heard him ask his mom for a Barbie like Robin&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin feels sorry for Connor but doesn&#39;t know how to make it better for<br/>\nhim.
