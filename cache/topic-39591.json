There&#39;s a whole lot of information there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kaitlin reads a few words by sight and attempts to sound some out <br/>\nbut that&#39;s about it.  Her pattern with things, though, is to go from <br/>\nwhat looks like not knowing about something to immediately doing the <br/>\nthing perfectly.  Thats how she learned to ride a bike and how to tie <br/>\nher shoes.  There&#39;s definitely a precedent here!  :)  I really think <br/>\nshe&#39;ll just start reading one of these days and amaze us.  Its just <br/>\nthe waiting that bugs me!  Everything else she&#39;s done, too,  has been <br/>\non the late side of normal, but that&#39;s just because she wants to be <br/>\nright on the first try.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She actually pulled out our &quot;Teach your child to read...&quot; book a <br/>\nfew days ago and did really well with it on her own.  I asked her to <br/>\nread some to me, though, but she doesn&#39;t want people to watch her <br/>\n(unless she WANTS someone to watch her - LOL!) and she also doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant anyone to make a big deal about it.  Its just how she is, and me <br/>\nbeing nervous about it is how I am.  The best thing for me to do is <br/>\nto relax.  Easier said than done sometimes, though.  Someday I&#39;ll <br/>\nlook back at it and laugh - at myself for over-reacting. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for the info and support.
