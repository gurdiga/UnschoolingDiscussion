The nipple is drawn far, far into the mouth, almost to the throat. So, they say, the milk can&#39;t pool near the teeth the way milk (or juice) from a bottle can. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen some articles on this question, in LLL publications and in Mothering Magazine, with statistical studies on cavities in bottlefed and breastfed babies, and it made sense to me.

This is because their excessive physical activity leaves their bodies in a dryer, less mucous, state. This proves your theory too! I&#39;ve also read that saliva is full of antibodies, that protect the body from illness being received orally, and also protect the teeth. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd, that had the cavities as an infant, got her first tooth at four months and a day. When the cavities appeared it seemed to happen in an instant. One day the teeth looked perfect the next day she had obvious decay. It cost thousands to have the work done to restore them. I had my first truly adult reality check when I realized how vulnerable we are and how lucky for us that we could afford to take care of this. My heart has been broken ever since for all of the children who can&#39;t get proper dental treatment... All of the mothers all over the world who can&#39;t keep they&#39;re babies safe etc etc etc.........I&#39;m afraid that becoming a mother is truly an affliction one can never recover from!!!

Joey <br/>\nat 2 had decay on four front teeth.  Both of them were taken to <br/>\nsurgery.  Camie came out with all of her teeth capped in silver - <br/>\nquite a surprise!  Joey had four front teeth on top removed and four <br/>\nmore capped.  The dentist said it was from juice in bottles. So when <br/>\nthird child, Andrew, came along, he got absolutely no juice in <br/>\nbottles, I took the best care of his teeth and he has two very rotten <br/>\nfront teeth - the worst of all three.  They don&#39;t hurt him but look <br/>\nawful.  We&#39;ve left them alone.  Joey had pain in his teeth so I felt <br/>\nOK with having them pulled but he still doesn&#39;t have any front teeth <br/>\nand he is 9 years old!  We haven&#39;t been to the dentist in a while - I <br/>\nam looking for a new one - and their teeth are relatively healthy.  <br/>\nOur Pediatrician, who I really love, says Andrew should have his<br/>\nfront teeth removed because he could have health problems like <br/>\ninfections constantly. But since I pulled Camie and Joey from school <br/>\ntwo years ago, they have been rarely sick and have only needed to go <br/>\nto the doctor for well check ups. Dh has lousy teeth, mine aren&#39;t <br/>\nperfect but OK.  So genetics could be a factor, but this little slice <br/>\nof &quot;expert advice&quot; has been one more chapter in trusting my own <br/>\ninstincts with my children over what the experts (ie doctors) say.  <br/>\nThe guilt I was made to feel over not taking care of the first two <br/>\nchildren&#39;s teeth was enormous - it&#39;s gone now though &lt;g&gt;. When and if <br/>\nthe children have problems with their teeth, like pain, we will go to <br/>\nthe dentist.  But I certainly will question carefully whatever the <br/>\ndentist advises - I won&#39;t go back to blind trust. Just hope we can <br/>\nfind one that won&#39;t lay on the guilt trip like the last one did and <br/>\njust treat their teeth!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening to this ramble.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa, mom to Camie - 10, Joey - 9, and Andrew - 5 and learning to <br/>\ntrust myself!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85994576,"authorName":"Kolleen","from":"Kolleen &lt;Kolleen@...&gt;","profile":"kaydeecross","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: teethbrushing","postDate":"1007963416","msgId":29833,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUxNkRmblktMDAwMFU1LTAwQGhhcnJpZXIucHJvZC5pdGQuZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":29832,"nextInTopic":29846,"prevInTime":29832,"nextInTime":29834,"topicId":29741,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
