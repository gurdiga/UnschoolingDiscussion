So - if you said: <br/>\n&quot;Dip the knife into the peanut butter,&quot; you&#39;d better have first said, <br/>\n&quot;Open the drawer,&quot; &quot;Take the knife from the drawer,&quot; and &quot;Open the <br/>\ncupboard,&quot; &quot;Take the peanut butter from the cupboard,&quot; and &quot;Open the <br/>\njar of peanut butter,&quot; because if you didn&#39;t already say all those <br/>\nthings, its going to be pretty hard to dip a nonexistent knife (since <br/>\nyou didn&#39;t get it from the drawer into an invisible and unopened jar of <br/>\npeanut butter.&quot;  Laugh at how hard it is to think of everything - have <br/>\nfun.

It does seem odd,<br/>\nthat she can think through these really long intricate strategies for<br/>\ngames and pretending and such, but she can&#39;t remember to put away her<br/>\nlaundry before the cat lies on it and sheds and dumps it onto the floor<br/>\nwhere it gets dirty, and then she puts it back in the dirty laundry<br/>\nhamper... or to not leave sugary stuff in her room until the ants invade.<br/>\nStuff like that...

( we have two indoor <br/>\ncats, I don&#39;t really care that much about the ac, but I was upset about the cats <br/>\npossibly getting out, and so was he).  I asked him if he could please leave <br/>\nthe house last to make sure the door gets closed, he said sure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that&#39;s all fine and good.
