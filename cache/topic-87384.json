I wish it <br/>\nhad been bigger.  I guess it&#39;s 21&quot; or 19&quot; but the one he had before was <br/>\nslightly bigger (and all messed up).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn top of the &quot;entertainment center&quot; is a Lego western town, quite dusty.  <br/>\nSome inside a fort, some outside, and a big box-looking thing.  I said &quot;Is this <br/>\nwhere you keep your other lego?&quot;  He said &quot;That&#39;s my bank.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI lifted the top off, because it&#39;s like a box with a lid.   There was change <br/>\nin there.  He said &quot;Take some out and put it in the front there.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I walked around it and saw it was a western-town bank.  For that western <br/>\ntown, it&#39;s a sensible high brick building with a reinforced front, a door <br/>\nwith windows on either side, a facade front, and in the top of the facade, if you <br/>\nput money anywhere along that top, it goes into a slot and into a chute into <br/>\nthe &quot;vault.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe  never made it and got excited and showed it off to us.  He just made it <br/>\nfor himself, dusty months ago, and I discovered it by poking around.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I called Keith to come and see it and gave him a handful of change from my <br/>\nown &quot;change cup&quot;  to try it out as Holly and I looked on admiringly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I would love some feedback of &quot;Favorite Strewing&quot; ideas.<br/>\nI have many ideas for younger children but with a 10 and 14 year old this <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem as easy.  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our main bathroom I have a book-end (I taped it to the counter) and I <br/>\nswitch things through.  Right now there&#39;s an Eddie Izzard book (sent from England <br/>\nbecause we couldn&#39;t get it here), Scholastic&#39;s Voyages of Discovery book about <br/>\nArchitecture (I LOVE that series), a timeline on the history of New Mexico (I <br/>\nfound it online looking for a detail, and hit &quot;print,&quot; stapled the pages and <br/>\nput it in the bathroom), a book on Egyptian artifacts Marty and I picked up at <br/>\nthe state museum in South Carolina in August, and a few other things.  The <br/>\nGreen Mile was in there, but a friend borrowed it.   Things get switched out not <br/>\nall as a batch, but I&#39;ll put a thing elsewhere or a kid will take it to his <br/>\nroom (the illustrated &quot;Hobbit&quot; isn&#39;t there anymore, I think I saw it in the <br/>\nlibrary--the REAL library, upstairs) or someone borrows it or I just put it away <br/>\nand something else gets in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI put the new Smithsonian on the kitchen table.

She has asked me about every photo, and <br/>\nshe got me to put my elementary class photos in there yesterday, each in a sheet <br/>\nprotector, and she went through all the people she knows who went to school <br/>\nwith me (four people, some in different years, some in more than one), and she <br/>\nhas talked about my hairdos in my own photos and how much my 6th year photo <br/>\nlooks like her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might put that out upstairs on a table because the boys might be interested <br/>\nin it too.  And then it will end up with other photo albums.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty is clearing his throat meaningfully behind me.  He wants a turn online.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly just said &quot;Dad and I are going to watch Logan&#39;s Run, you want to watch <br/>\nit with us, Marty?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What&#39;s it about?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The future, from the 80&#39;s&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;How far in the future?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t know.

You don&#39;t have to <br/>\nwatch it all, you could just watch part of it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m listening in hopes he&#39;ll bite, and I can keep the computer, but no, he <br/>\nhas declined and is milling about the door there, discussing DVD settings with <br/>\nHolly, and how to get it to &quot;widescreen.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so I am bounced.

The <br/>\nco-sleeping thread gave me that idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day (dh drove up to NJ for a funeral while we stayed home sick), <br/>\nI cleared out Sam&#39;s closet, yanked down the hanging rod and painted the <br/>\nwhole thing. I painted a rescue hero border around the bottom and moved one <br/>\nof the HUGE Rescue Hero Command Centers that the kids got for xmas up <br/>\nthere, giving him a whole new play space in his 9x9 room. Dh raised the <br/>\nhanging stuff so it&#39;s out of the way, and now there&#39;s no wasted space up at <br/>\nthe top of the closet. Sam has a whole new room!<br/>\n<br/>\nI also officially moved all the art stuff (that had been trickling its way <br/>\nup anyway) upstairs to a cleared-out kitchen cabinet. The kids were so <br/>\nexcited! We bought a really great kitchen table from IKEA about 18 mos. <br/>\nago, and that&#39;s where do most of our projects anyway. Now, we don&#39;t have to <br/>\ndrag stuff back and forth. I&#39;d already moved all our board games up about a <br/>\nmonth ago, and that&#39;s been super too. I think re-organizing works in much <br/>\nthe same way as rotating--makes everything new again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis move cleared out a bunch of space to put up shelving and begin <br/>\nshifting the kids&#39; clothes storage to the laundry room. Thank you, Lyle! <br/>\nThe kids are excited about having drawer space for more important things <br/>\nlike barbies and doll stuff, and I&#39;m excited about making laundry easier <br/>\nand creating some more room in the family room! Right now, I&#39;m trying to <br/>\ndecide what kind of shelving would work best. I&#39;m thinking about that <br/>\ntypical white wire shelving, but I&#39;m concerned that clothes will just spill <br/>\noff the shelves as the kids dig for the pants that they want to wear, know <br/>\nwhat I mean? Lyle--what do you use to contain your clothes? Drawers have <br/>\nsides, so things can be all a jumble without spilling out, but shelves <br/>\ndon&#39;t have this.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeeling very productive and ready to take on a whole new year! Thanks for <br/>\nall the great ideas and for challenging me to think more critically!  Happy <br/>\nnew year everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87367,"nextTopicId":57047}}
