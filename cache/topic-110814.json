I just wanted to share how we waterproof our mattresses for Parker. If you get an old wool blanket, wash it in hot & dry it on high, it will be felted and act as a barrier for pee. We put that over the mattress, a thick towel on top of that and fleece blanket on top of the towel. No sheet. He sleeps in poly fleece jammies no undies or no pants at all. If he wets, the fleece draws all the moisture away from him, the towel absorbs it, and the wool won&#39;t let it through to the mattress. He stays warm and dry. The bed is protected. The wool can be aired out, and only needs to be washed every couple of weeks or so. The fleece & towel can go right in the wash. It sounds a little complicated at first, but honestly it is very comfy & easy to maintain!! Totally avoids the needs for diapers/pullups/depends (unless your kids prefer them!!).

We use one<br/>\nthat does Gonstead method and that is what I recommend.  We have seen<br/>\nchiropractors for years and it even saved my mother from having shoulder<br/>\nreplacement surgery.  If you are not familiar with chiropractic treatment,<br/>\ncheck it out.it helps so much.  My chiropractor explains it like this:<br/>\nEvery nerve that helps with every function of your body (heart, sinuses,<br/>\nlungs, kidneys. everything) goes through the spinal column and out your<br/>\nspinal cords.  If there subluxation (something out of alignment) then it<br/>\ncauses whatever function are effected to not function at 100%, which causes<br/>\nyour body to not properly heal itself.  If you have a cut, it&#39;s not the band<br/>\naide that heals it.your body heals itself.  Almost every single person has<br/>\nmisalignments and don&#39;t realize it.  If I have allergies, headaches or sinus<br/>\nproblems, I will go to my chiropractor before I do anything else.<br/>\nBedwetting is definitely something that could be caused by the spine not<br/>\nbeing aligned properly.  I would also try water with lemon juice and all<br/>\nnatural juices like cranberry juice with little sugar.  Infections, even a<br/>\nslight lingering one that you don&#39;t even realize is there can cause frequent<br/>\nurination.  But, like some others have said, sometimes, it&#39;s just something<br/>\nthat is unexplainable and they will out grow.  I had a daughter who<br/>\noccasionally wet the bed until about 7 yo.  Just curious.was this child a<br/>\nc-section baby?  My chiropractor has some interesting info on this as well<br/>\nand how it effects children by not being birthed naturally through the birth<br/>\ncanal.it&#39;s interesting.btw, my bed wetter was a c-section baby.

Bladders are a smooth muscle that spasm. Some bladders spasm uncontrollably. Sometimes the urethra (the tube that carries the urine from the bladder to the outside) has a reflux problem, causing a bladder that thinks it has been emptied to fill back up. (think gastric reflux only this is urine coming back up) The first condition requires medication sometimes, most times the bladder matures on its own. The reflux problem causes accidents and infections. It requires medication, antibiotics, and sometimes surgery. And requires sonograms and cystograms to properly diagnose. And sometimes years to treat.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  There are other problems and causes of accidents, but the most important thing is to remember that bladders like walking, talking, reading, and life need time to mature at their own rate. And that telling a child they are too old to be wetting the bed means nothing to the bladder. Regardless if you have or have not said anything to your boys, give it some more time and patience, and if you are really worried that there might be a deeper cause than just an immature bladder, make an appointment with their doctor to discuss your worries. <br/>\n  ~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1379016,"authorName":"Kathleen Whitfield","from":"Kathleen Whitfield &lt;kmckernan@...&gt;","profile":"kathwhit2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Bedwetting- Couple questions","postDate":"1135353481","msgId":110828,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJGRDE1RTg5LjRCNTAxJWttY2tlcm5hbkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjIyMjMwNDA0LjMzMTgzNEQyNEB0eWxlci5jcy50YW11LmVkdT4="},"prevInTopic":110827,"nextInTopic":110829,"prevInTime":110827,"nextInTime":110829,"topicId":110814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son stopped wearing Goodnites or generic nighttime pull-ups at age 9.5.

We bought one of those alarms that snap onto the underwear.   It goes off at the first sign of wetness.  He even slept through that (but we didn&#39;t LOL!!).  It only took about a week for him to adjust and he no longer needed it and has never wet the bed since.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Kim J.

The two that are are 5 and 7 and still in pull ups at night.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;m not sure that 5 or even 7 is too old to be wetting the bed.  My sister wet the bed until she was about 10.  Both her kids wet the bed to 7 or so, and my brother&#39;s kids until 6 or 8.  I think it just goes with the territory for some kids, whether it&#39;s bladder size, habit or whatever.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My kids haven&#39;t been long-term bedwetters, but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s because we have co-slept and dh & I are very tuned in to the warning signs.  And there are often warning signs.  With my sis, it was sleep-talking.  Also true for Andy, who was dry all night (well, from about 11pm to 5 am) by 4.  With the other two boys, it&#39;s restlessness in their sleep.  We still regularly take Dan to the bathroom to pee -- in his sleep -- sometime after he falls asleep. If we put him to bed in his own room (like so many parents do) we&#39;d miss the signs and he would regularly wet the bed, but why put him thru that when we can help?  It&#39;s the loving thing to do.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  How to clean the mattress?  No really good ideas there.  I would suggest that you invest in some plastic-backed mattress pads -- the kind that are soft on top, so the kids don&#39;t have to sleep on a crinkly bed.  My Mom just kept lots of towels and clean sheets handy so I could help my sister get back to bed on towels and change the sheets in the morning, and she accepted that when sis outgrew it they&#39;d buy her a new mattress.  Once I figured out that she talked when she needed to get up to pee -- and I was the ONLY one who slept lightly enough to hear her -- it became my job to help her.  If nothing else, it gave us all enough perspective that bed-wetting by our own kids has always been no biggie for us; it&#39;s just something some kids do.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Syl<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMom to Will (20) Andy (9) and Dan (4.5) <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

I <br/>\nthink the best advice is, plastic mattress covers, and  pullups, and let them <br/>\ngrow out of it.  If you can&#39;t afford pullups, we just  got the big thick <br/>\ntraining pants, and put a small hand towel folded up in it  (bulk in front for boys, <br/>\nmiddle for girls :o), and a pair of sleepy pants or  sweats over it.

Even age 12  is not particularly unusual.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n I think the larger size pull ups or nighttimes are a wonderful invention.<br/>\nThe time will come that they are no longer needed but,  until then,  no<br/>\nreason to &quot;get concerned&quot;.   I thought that wearing the pull-ups would<br/>\nprevent the mattress from getting wet?  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nCleaning a mattress...instead of Febreze, you could try soaking it with one<br/>\nof the enzyme preparations for biological stains.    These will take days to<br/>\nwork,  and then you will need to dry completely.   Bright sunlight the best<br/>\nfor final drying and airing but this is not really the season :-).<br/>\nAfter  it is completely clean  (or even if you decide cleaning is hopeless)<br/>\nget a zip on plastic mattress cover.   That will keep the mattress from<br/>\ngetting wet again as well as &quot;seal-in&quot;   any odors OR  allergens.    For<br/>\ncomfort you will want to have a  padded or quilted washable mattress cover.<br/>\nYears ago when my children were still children :-),  we often had &quot;extras&quot;<br/>\nspending the night  and tried to be matter of fact about bedwetting<br/>\nsituations.    <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNo pull-ups in those days.   We had mail ordered some night time underwear<br/>\nfor one of my sons but it was bulky and uncomfortable.      Our routine<br/>\nsolution was 1) the &quot;old-style&quot;  waterbeds with just a &quot;bag&quot;  for a mattress<br/>\nand 2) liberal use of  sleeping bags with outer layer waterproof material.<br/>\n3) Even comforters on top of  &quot;camp pads&quot;  provided good absorption  and<br/>\ncould be easily thrown in washer. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring those years  our washer and dryer got LOTS  of use.   The nasal<br/>\nsprays to suppress nighttime urination had come into use by then and we<br/>\nconsidered it for summer camp  although were not interested in it for daily<br/>\nuse.    Seemed to us that the risks of routine use outweighed the<br/>\ninconvenience of added laundry.    Again, Goodnights were not around then. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nVicki <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Kim J.
