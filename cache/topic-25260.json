I am bundle of nerves while I await calls from<br/>\nsome friends. I have heard from my mom (in Washington DC), her husband is a<br/>\nbig wig in the military and often consults with the Presidents (Reagan thru<br/>\ncurrent)...  My husband is military, my brother too. We have lots of friends<br/>\nin military and I have a girlfriend in New York City. This certaintly  puts<br/>\nall our petty disagreements in proper perspective. I ask that we all pray in<br/>\nare own way. This is incredibly serious.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone with family in any of the areas or flights can call the Red Cross.<br/>\nThey are amazing and will help. If they can&#39;t they will give you the numbers<br/>\nof people who can. Michele I hope that helps....I will pray for you and your<br/>\ndaughters. Keep us updated.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sheri</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25167,"nextTopicId":25270}}
