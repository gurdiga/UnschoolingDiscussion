That doesn&#39;t even touch college tuition.<br></font></div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">For those with kids, that figure leads to wild \n  fantasies about all&nbsp;the things we could have bought, all the places we \n  could have&nbsp;traveled, all the money we could have banked if not for \n  (insert child&#39;s&nbsp;name here).<br></font></div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">For others, that number might confirm the \n  decision to remain&nbsp;childless.<br></font></div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">But $160,140 isn&#39;t so bad if you break it \n  down. It translates&nbsp;into $8,896.66 a year, $741.38 a month or $171.08 a \n  week. That&#39;s a&nbsp;mere $24.44 a day. Just over a dollar an hour. Still, you \n  might think&nbsp;the&nbsp;best&nbsp;financial advice says don&#39;t have children \n  if you want to be rich. It&#39;s&nbsp;just&nbsp;the opposite.<br></font></div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">There&#39;s no way to put a price tag \n  on:<br>*Feeling a new life move for the first time and seeing the bump \n  of&nbsp;a knee rippling across your skin.<br>* Having someone cry, &quot;It&#39;s a \n  boy!&quot; or shout, &quot;It&#39;s a girl!&quot; then&nbsp;hearing the baby wail and knowing all \n  that matters is it&#39;s healthy.<br>* Counting all 10 fingers and toes for the \n  first time.<br>* Feeling the warmth of fat cheeks against your breast.<br>* \n  Cupping an entire head in the palm of your hand.<br>* Making out da da or ma \n  ma from all the cooing and gurgling.<br></font></div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">What do you get for your $160,140?<br>* Naming \n  rights. First, middle and last.<br>* Glimpses of God every day.<br>* Giggles \n  under the covers every night.<br>* More love than your heart can hold.<br>* \n  Butterfly kisses and Velcro hugs.<br>* Endless wonder over rocks, ants, clouds \n  and warm cookies.<br>* A hand to hold, usually covered with jam.<br>* A \n  partner for blowing bubbles, flying kites, building sand castles and skipping \n  down the sidewalk in the pouring rain.<br>* Someone to laugh yourself silly \n  with no matter what the boss said or how your stocks performed that \n  day.<br></font></div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">For $160,140, you never have to grow up. You \n  get to finger-paint,&nbsp;carve pumpkins, play hide-and-seek, catch lightning \n  bugs and never stop believing in Santa Claus.<br></font></div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">You have an excuse to keep reading the \n  adventures of Piglet and&nbsp;Pooh, watching Saturday morning cartoons, going \n  to Disney movies and&nbsp;wishing on stars.<br></font></div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">You get to frame rainbows, hearts and flowers \n  under refrigerator&nbsp;magnets and collect spray-painted noodle wreaths for \n  Christmas,&nbsp;handprints&nbsp;set&nbsp;in clay for Mother&#39;s Day and cards \n  with backward letters for Father&#39;s&nbsp;Day.<br></font></div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">For $160,140, there&#39;s no greater bang for your \n  buck.<br></font></div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">You get to be a hero just for retrieving a \n  Frisbee off the garage&nbsp;roof, taking the training wheels off the bike, \n  removing a sliver,&nbsp;filling the wading pool, coaxing a wad of gum out of \n  bangs and coaching&nbsp;a&nbsp;baseball team that never wins but always gets \n  treated to ice cream&nbsp;regardless. </font></div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">You get a front-row seat to history to witness \n  the first step,&nbsp;first word, first bra, first date, first time behind the \n  wheel.<br></font></div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">You get to be immortal. You get another branch \n  added to your&nbsp;family tree, and if you&#39;re lucky, a long list of limbs in \n  your<br>obituary&nbsp;called&nbsp;grandchildren.<br></font></div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">You get an education in psychology, nursing, \n  criminal justice,&nbsp;communications and human sexuality no college can \n  match.<br></font></div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">In the eyes of a child, you rank right up \n  there with God.<br></font></div>\n  <div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">You have the power to heal a boo-boo, scare \n  away monsters under&nbsp;the bed, patch a broken heart, police a slumber \n  party, ground them&nbsp;forever&nbsp;and love them without limits, so one day \n  they will, like you, love&nbsp;without&nbsp;counting the \n  cost.<br><br></font></div></font></div><tt>Message boards, timely articles, a \n  free newsletter and more!<br>Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br><br>Addresses:<br>Post \n  message: Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com<br>Unsubscribe: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br>List owner: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com<br>List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br></tt><br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11556,"nextTopicId":11561}}
