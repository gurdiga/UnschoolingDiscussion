Some people are<br/>\nmore affected by their environment than others. For some a feeling might be<br/>\nlike a wave from a passing motor boat. For others it&#39;s like a tsunami.

If a child is communicating that he<br/>\nwants something and he&#39;s constantly told he can&#39;t have it, he&#39;s going to<br/>\nblow. If you kept trying to tell your husband you needed something and he<br/>\nkept saying effectively that&#39;s not important, that doesn&#39;t matter, how would<br/>\nyou react?
