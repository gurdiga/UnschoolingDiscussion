You reminded me of an observation my sister made last week. It may seem totally unrelated to many of you but I think it&#39;s part of this discussion. She remarked that it looked like my bust had shrunk :~) In fact I&#39;m the same size as I&#39;ve been for most of my life but she has always perceived me differently.We&#39;re in our 40&#39;s and we see each other several times a week, and spend the summers together at our family cottage, so it&#39;s not as if she forgot, it is simply the way she perceives me. It&#39;s especially interesting as it pertains to a physical attribute, rather than a perception of  personality or behavior, which is what I&#39;d tend to consider to be the more subjective. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur propensity to believe that we&#39;re rational thinkers, leads us to imagine that what we see and believe is the truth, rather than a perceived reality, based on our personal assumptions. We search for and surround ourselves with people, research and ideas, that support us rather than challenge us because of the comfort we naturally seek. It&#39;s not about right or wrong it&#39;s more about trying to make meaning and find comfort that stands in the way of really free thinking. We tend to gravitate toward what we conceive of as concrete and we&#39;re weary of abstract ideas which are harder to communicate and are more often misunderstood. Being a parent and feeling responsible for the outcome of another&#39;s life is a frightening endeavor however inconsequential our role may in fact be. <br/>\n<br/>\nStanding by and watching our children &quot;waste&quot; their time with activity that we perceive/know will lead to negative outcomes is as difficult with grown children/people as it is with young ones who we have &quot;control&quot; over. The difference is that an older child/person might, at some point, insist on their autonomy being respected and will spend their time with those they perceive as respecting them. The little ones feel shame and anger but it takes them sometime to learn what to do with it.  They are totally dependent on our benevolence and they know it. I&#39;ve see the fear in my children&#39;s eyes more times than I&#39;d like to admit. They don&#39;t know what a parents love feels like, they truly fear that my feelings could change and I might reject them. I nursed them all until they were 4 or 5, they sleep with us in our family bed until they decide they want more privacy, we remind them that their home is with us and for as long as we&#39;re alive we&#39;ll share all that we have, and still, I see that fear in their innocent faces when I push them or show them my disapproval. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your worried about TV and Video games offer them an alternative activity that they will agree to. Take them to the park or for a bike ride, play a game together, involve them in the cooking or the house work etc... I&#39;ve always found that when the kids are young they&#39;d rather do something with me than anything else. That changes with teens and once they&#39;re sexual you can say good bye to the good times for a while! I&#39;m too old to get on this roller coaster again and I fear that their heartbreaks and mistakes are harder for me to endure than my own were.<br/>\nLeslie  <br/>\n<br/>\nps.

Please<br/>\n  &gt; try to read what I wrote, not what you have decided I am writing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; And, actually a study was done that shows that some children, a limited<br/>\n  &gt; number, do not think while &quot;zoning&quot; in front of the boob tube.  Some<br/>\n  &gt; children actually go into an almost sleep/dream state, a sort of<br/>\n  &gt; self-hypnosis inwhich they brain waves patterns indicate no active thought<br/>\n  &gt; patterns.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Can you site a source for this? I can&#39;t seem to find one. What I did find<br/>\n  (over and over and over) is a quote from &quot;Battle for Your Mind: Subliminal<br/>\n  Programming&quot;:  by Dick Sutphen:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Recent tests by researcher Herbert Krugman showed that, while<br/>\n  &gt; viewers were watching TV, right-brain activity outnumbered left-brain<br/>\n  &gt; activity by a ratio of two to one. Put more simply, the viewers were<br/>\n  &gt; in an altered state . . . in trance more often than not. They were<br/>\n  &gt; getting their Beta-endorphin &quot;fix.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; To measure attention spans, psychophysiologist Thomas Mulholland<br/>\n  &gt; of the Veterans Hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts, attached young<br/>\n  &gt; viewers to an EEG machine that was wired to shut the TV set off<br/>\n  &gt; whenever the children&#39;s brains produced a majority of alpha waves.<br/>\n  &gt; Although the children were told to concentrate, only a few could<br/>\n  &gt; keep the set on for more than 30 seconds!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Left brain activity (according to an anatomy and physiology text) is<br/>\n  associated with spoken and written language, numerical and scientific skills<br/>\n  and reasoning. Right brain activity is associated with musical and artistic<br/>\n  awareness, space and pattern perception, insight, imagination, generating<br/>\n  mental images to compare spatial relationships. (No connection is made<br/>\n  between right brained activities and being in a trance like state.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;From that list, it makes sense to me that TV watching would be a right<br/>\n  brained activity. I suppose if there&#39;s something inherently wrong with right<br/>\n  brained activities, we should stop kids from drawing and imagining and being<br/>\n  insightful. <br/>\n<br/>\n  The text says that alpha waves are present in the EEGs of nearly all normal<br/>\n  individuals when they are awake and resting with their eyes closed. These<br/>\n  waves disappear entirely during sleep. Beta waves generally appear when the<br/>\n  nervous system is active, that is, during periods of sensory input and<br/>\n  mental activity. (Not that it says generally.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  (Just as an interesting factoid, it says delta waves occur during deep sleep<br/>\n  but they are also normal in an awake infant.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Another site says alpha waves are brought out by closing the eyes and by<br/>\n  relaxation, and abolished by eye opening or alerting by any mechanism<br/>\n  (thinking, calculating). It is the major rhythm seen in normal relaxed<br/>\n  adults - it is present during most of life especially beyond the thirteenth<br/>\n  year when it dominates the resting tracing. (Alpha waves are also present<br/>\n  during meditation and hypnosis.) And that beta waves are the dominant rhythm<br/>\n  in patients who are alert or anxious or who have their eyes open.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That would suggest people aren¹t thinking when they watch TV. But does that<br/>\n  make sense? I could list off a huge number of things that I¹ve learned from<br/>\n  watching TV. How can learning take place without thinking? There is also<br/>\n  research into Controlling Computers With Neural Signals (in Scientific<br/>\n  American at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sciam.com/1096issue/1096lusted.html)\">http://www.sciam.com/1096issue/1096lusted.html)</a> which uses Alpha<br/>\n  and Mu waves. If alpha waves stop when thought happens, how could those<br/>\n  waves be used to perform a computer action if we have to stop thinking in<br/>\n  order to generate them?<br/>\n<br/>\n  What it really means is that people enjoy dabbling in pseudoscience. They<br/>\n  are using faulty logic -- hypnosis may generate alpha but that doesn¹t mean<br/>\n  alpha indicates hypnosis, thinking may generate beta but that doesn¹t mean<br/>\n  that beta indicates thinking (or that lack of beta means lack of thinking)<br/>\n  -- to draw a conclusion to fit their theory.<br/>\n<br/>\n  To get a more complete picture we¹d need to know what the waves look like<br/>\n  when we¹re deeply involved in a novel. Or watching a play. Or playing a<br/>\n  video game. Or watching a sporting event. Or painting. Or gazing down at a<br/>\n  sleeping or nursing infant. (Not that it would indicate anything. It would<br/>\n  just be more data on how the brain operates.) If alpha waves increased<br/>\n  during those times, should we stop those things? Or does it merely mean that<br/>\n  ³thinking stops alpha waves² and ³beta is present during mental activity²<br/>\n  are too simplistic and don¹t adequately describe what¹s going on?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I bet he would have looked dead &#39;cuz that&#39;s how he looked<br/>\nfrom the outside.  Mindless bloob about describes it perfectly.  When we<br/>\ndragged him away he was this bright intelligent child after a while, when<br/>\nhe was watch all TV all the time he barely communicated at all.  In fact<br/>\nyou could walk in the room and talk to him and he would not even know it,<br/>\nit was like he just went completely away.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no regrets about my actions in limiting his TV and nothing anyone<br/>\nhere says is going to change that.  Some may say things like, &quot;you only<br/>\nsee what you want to be true.&quot;  But perhaps it kinda, sorta is the other<br/>\nway &#39;round.  Perhaps they think that everyone should do exactly what they<br/>\ndid and what worked for them precisely because they have never met one<br/>\nlike mine.  And I give them the benefit of the doubt and listen (except<br/>\nto the condescending stuff) but find that usually, it comes down to<br/>\ntrusting that I see the situation more clearly here living in it than<br/>\nthey do, especially considering that they have no contact with 5 of the<br/>\npeople involved, only contact with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo once again, my advice is to trust your instincts.  But step back and<br/>\nlook at the situation to be sure.  I have two that were fine with<br/>\nunlimited TV and one that is definitely not fine.  It actually took my a<br/>\nlong time (probably longer than it should have) to step in and stop it<br/>\nbecause I believed so much in them taking responsibility for themselves<br/>\n(after all it had worked with the first two).<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\nPS Lynda, I suspect that obsession with things electronic is a genetic<br/>\npredisposition - he gets it from me.  Through the years I have had to<br/>\ntake conscious control of Tetris, Poppit, Carnival, Galaga, TV and the<br/>\nInternet.  It took me a LONG time to recognize it in myself.  Now, if<br/>\nsomething starts interfering with my life, I recognize it faster because<br/>\nI saw it in my son.

I can&#39;t seem to find one. What I did find<br/>\n(over and over and over) is a quote from &quot;Battle for Your Mind: Subliminal<br/>\nProgramming&quot;:  by Dick Sutphen:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Recent tests by researcher Herbert Krugman showed that, while<br/>\n&gt; viewers were watching TV, right-brain activity outnumbered left-brain<br/>\n&gt; activity by a ratio of two to one. Put more simply, the viewers were<br/>\n&gt; in an altered state . . . in trance more often than not. They were<br/>\n&gt; getting their Beta-endorphin &quot;fix.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To measure attention spans, psychophysiologist Thomas Mulholland<br/>\n&gt; of the Veterans Hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts, attached young<br/>\n&gt; viewers to an EEG machine that was wired to shut the TV set off<br/>\n&gt; whenever the children&#39;s brains produced a majority of alpha waves.<br/>\n&gt; Although the children were told to concentrate, only a few could<br/>\n&gt; keep the set on for more than 30 seconds!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Left brain activity (according to an anatomy and physiology text) is<br/>\nassociated with spoken and written language, numerical and scientific skills<br/>\nand reasoning. Right brain activity is associated with musical and artistic<br/>\nawareness, space and pattern perception, insight, imagination, generating<br/>\nmental images to compare spatial relationships. (No connection is made<br/>\nbetween right brained activities and being in a trance like state.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom that list, it makes sense to me that TV watching would be a right<br/>\nbrained activity. I suppose if there&#39;s something inherently wrong with right<br/>\nbrained activities, we should stop kids from drawing and imagining and being<br/>\ninsightful. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe text says that alpha waves are present in the EEGs of nearly all normal<br/>\nindividuals when they are awake and resting with their eyes closed. These<br/>\nwaves disappear entirely during sleep. Beta waves generally appear when the<br/>\nnervous system is active, that is, during periods of sensory input and<br/>\nmental activity. (Not that it says generally.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(Just as an interesting factoid, it says delta waves occur during deep sleep<br/>\nbut they are also normal in an awake infant.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother site says alpha waves are brought out by closing the eyes and by<br/>\nrelaxation, and abolished by eye opening or alerting by any mechanism<br/>\n(thinking, calculating). It is the major rhythm seen in normal relaxed<br/>\nadults - it is present during most of life especially beyond the thirteenth<br/>\nyear when it dominates the resting tracing. (Alpha waves are also present<br/>\nduring meditation and hypnosis.) And that beta waves are the dominant rhythm<br/>\nin patients who are alert or anxious or who have their eyes open.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would suggest people aren¹t thinking when they watch TV. But does that<br/>\nmake sense? I could list off a huge number of things that I¹ve learned from<br/>\nwatching TV. How can learning take place without thinking? There is also<br/>\nresearch into Controlling Computers With Neural Signals (in Scientific<br/>\nAmerican at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sciam.com/1096issue/1096lusted.html)\">http://www.sciam.com/1096issue/1096lusted.html)</a> which uses Alpha<br/>\nand Mu waves. If alpha waves stop when thought happens, how could those<br/>\nwaves be used to perform a computer action if we have to stop thinking in<br/>\norder to generate them?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it really means is that people enjoy dabbling in pseudoscience. They<br/>\nare using faulty logic -- hypnosis may generate alpha but that doesn¹t mean<br/>\nalpha indicates hypnosis, thinking may generate beta but that doesn¹t mean<br/>\nthat beta indicates thinking (or that lack of beta means lack of thinking)<br/>\n-- to draw a conclusion to fit their theory.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get a more complete picture we¹d need to know what the waves look like<br/>\nwhen we¹re deeply involved in a novel. Or watching a play. Or playing a<br/>\nvideo game. Or watching a sporting event. Or painting. Or gazing down at a<br/>\nsleeping or nursing infant. (Not that it would indicate anything. It would<br/>\njust be more data on how the brain operates.) If alpha waves increased<br/>\nduring those times, should we stop those things? Or does it merely mean that<br/>\n³thinking stops alpha waves² and ³beta is present during mental activity²<br/>\nare too simplistic and don¹t adequately describe what¹s going on?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","profile":"anoydami","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Ate2jSURE_wql0HIprsddy9qH4Nokz11IPIg99n3Ttd-RW_tZASgZGLwM6t_5hSotdZExYdHV-bRtcK-PVYbjxKgHA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Deschooling-video games","postDate":"1005332626","msgId":27537,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMGUwMWMxNjk1MSQ5OWJjMzM4MCQ0ODVkZDFkMUBqaWRhMzU+","referencesHeader":"PDE2Yi4zYTUzMGUxLjI5MWQ3OTU3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":27535,"nextInTopic":27543,"prevInTime":27536,"nextInTime":27538,"topicId":27520,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, I haven t met any honest politicians but that doesn t mean they don t exist.

Some studies have been done to show that video<br/>\n&gt; &gt; games affect humans self-control capability.  I don&#39;t know if this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can be said of all cases but I can attest to its effects on my son.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He becomes aggresive and loses his temper easily after spending long<br/>\n&gt; &gt; amounts of time playing video games.  These are not violent games but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they are &quot;action&quot; games.  He does fine with games like Sim City or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Pokemon (gameboy version).

When<br/>\nshe was little she had a bedtime.  Now that she is older we have discussed<br/>\nthis and when she is beyond tired, I tell her to go look at what she calls<br/>\nher &quot;saggy, baggy&quot; tired eyes and then she takes herself off to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe is no such thing as &quot;A&quot; definition of unschooling, nor is there any one,<br/>\nsingle &quot;correct&quot; way of doing it.
