Pretty interesting,<br/>\nsince he wasn&#39;t interested in learning to write his last name 2 days ago.<br/>\nOh, and he&#39;s writing with all angular lines.  (large T, E, F, small r&#39;s, i &<br/>\nc. )  He loves to do numbers with his dad and can tell you what 10 to the<br/>\n3rd power is from watching &quot;Cosmos&quot; since he was 3 years old!
