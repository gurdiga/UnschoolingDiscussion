I played<br/>\nfor 5 years and was pretty good at it, but quit in high school.  My memory<br/>\nof quitting is that I was tired of having to carry the violin around, back<br/>\nand forth to school and home for practice and use at both places.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh says that is ridiculous, that nobody would ever quit for that reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe comment below makes me wonder if the pressure to accomplish something<br/>\nfor others was a subconscious factor in my decision to quit.
