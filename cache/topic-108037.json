Someone who&#39;s superstitious or afraid of the voodoo-related <br/>\nreligions in the south will be more likely to have come across that word, I <br/>\nguess, or people who have that anthropological curiosity about what&#39;s what.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Treasure Island by Stevenson, there&#39;s the passage about the black spot <br/>\n(some kind of death threat consisting of a darkened black circle on a piece of <br/>\npaper).   I lifted the quotes from here<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.talewins.com/Treasures/Kids/Island/29.htm\">http://www.talewins.com/Treasures/Kids/Island/29.htm</a><br/>\nso Chapter 29<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re trying to intimidate Long John Silver by delivering them a black <br/>\nspot, some kind of death threat, but he spooks them way worse in return by telling <br/>\nthem what bad luck it is that one of them has cut a Bible.   Dick, whose <br/>\nBible it is, says that it will still be good (&quot;It&#39;ll do to kiss the book on <br/>\nstill&quot;--for swearing oaths or for getting a blessing, I think--what Bibles would be <br/>\nkissed about).   Silver assures him no, that being cut it will have lost its <br/>\npower and be no more good than a ballad-book.   Dick would kinda like to have a <br/>\nballad book and perks up, but that doesn&#39;t keep him from feeling he&#39;s cursed <br/>\nhimself and their group plan.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-<br/>\n &quot;The black spot! I thought so,&quot; he observed. &quot;Where might you have got the <br/>\npaper? Why, hillo! Look here, now; this ain&#39;t lucky! You&#39;ve gone and cut this <br/>\nout of a Bible. What fool&#39;s cut a Bible?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;Ah, there!&quot; said Morgan. &quot;There! Wot did I say? No good&#39;ll come o&#39; that, I <br/>\nsaid.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;Well, you&#39;ve about fixed it now, among you,&quot; continued Silver. &quot;You&#39;ll all <br/>\nswing now, I reckon. What soft- headed lubber had a Bible?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;It was Dick,&quot; said one.<br/>\n<br/>\n. . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;So that&#39;s the toon, is it?&quot; cried the cook. &quot;George, I reckon you&#39;ll have <br/>\nto wait another turn, friend; and lucky for you as I&#39;m not a revengeful man. <br/>\nBut that was never my way. And now, shipmates, this black spot? &#39;Tain&#39;t much <br/>\ngood now, is it? Dick&#39;s crossed his luck and spoiled his Bible, and that&#39;s about <br/>\nall.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;It&#39;ll do to kiss the book on still, won&#39;t it?&quot; growled Dick, who was <br/>\nevidently uneasy at the curse he had brought upon himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;A Bible with a bit cut out!&quot; returned Silver derisively. &quot;Not it. It don&#39;t <br/>\nbind no more&#39;n a ballad-book.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;Don&#39;t it, though?&quot; cried Dick with a sort of joy. &quot;Well, I reckon that&#39;s <br/>\nworth having too.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;Here, Jim--here&#39;s a cur&#39;osity for you,&quot; said Silver, and he tossed me the <br/>\npaper.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was around about the size of a crown piece. One side was blank, for it had <br/>\nbeen the last leaf; the other contained a verse or two of Revelation--these <br/>\nwords among the rest, which struck sharply home upon my mind: &quot;Without are dogs <br/>\nand murderers.&quot; The printed side had been blackened with wood ash, which <br/>\nalready began to come off and soil my fingers; on the blank side had been written <br/>\nwith the same material the one word &quot;Depposed.&quot; I have that curiosity beside <br/>\nme at this moment, but not a trace of writing now remains beyond a single <br/>\nscratch, such as a man might make with his thumb-nail.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(more in another post)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108060,"nextTopicId":108031}}
