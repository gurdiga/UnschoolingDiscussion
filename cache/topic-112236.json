Our guest room is a whole other Barbie <br/>\nworld!  The continuous story involves Wonder Woman, her mother, Queen <br/>\nHippolyta and the Oracle along with Wonder Woman&#39;s various sisters (all <br/>\nplayed by Barbies of course).  Most recently Paradise Island (our guest <br/>\nbed) was home to an all women&#39;s Olympics.  Evie has two Ken&#39;s but they <br/>\nlive in the piano bench and are rarely seen! LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend (homeschooler) who forbade her daughter to play with <br/>\nBarbies.  She and I talked MANY times about why she had that rule (body <br/>\nimage, materialism and appropriate role models were some of the <br/>\ntopics).  We talked about how Evie and I play with Barbies, we talked <br/>\nabout the worst case scenario she could imagine happening if her <br/>\ndaughter had Barbies.  This past Christmas this wonderful friend bought <br/>\nher daughter two Barbies and gave her her old Barbies as well!!  Now <br/>\nher daughter and mine happily play Barbies every chance they get!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite recent quote from Evie regarding Barbies happened when I <br/>\nwas straightening the house and was about to put away the atlas that <br/>\nwas lying open on the piano in the guest room. &quot;Mama, please don&#39;t put <br/>\nthat away!  Everyone knows you can&#39;t play Barbies without an atlas!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn I will email you off-list with some of our Barbie dioramas--the <br/>\nlatest involves rock climbing and living with a jungle beast (our cat).<br/>\n<br/>\nJen (who LOVES to play Barbies too!)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://circletheworld.blogspot.com\">http://circletheworld.blogspot.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112198,"nextTopicId":112237}}
