Where you paint the wall with a white non absorbent paint.  Then you use washable/watercolor paints to make a color effect, soft and relaxing that can be washed off and redone each season.  Thought that sounded pretty cool.  It might be an idea for your daughter as long as she doesn&#39;t use pens that would make indents in the paint surface.

I turned the &quot;coat closet&quot; in the living room into<br/>\nJayn&#39;s tiny play room and since she sometimes likes to play privately there<br/>\n(as well as have a storage area) I imagine that her own room will be used in<br/>\nthe same way. James has the idea that her toys won&#39;t migrate, but I doubt<br/>\nthat heartily. The other things we are looking forward to are a<br/>\nsewing/crafts room that we will share, a radio shack for James&#39; electronic<br/>\ngizmos, and a garden.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Started when she was 2 and got ahold of a crayon when she was supposed to be napping. Her parents kept it up on the wall, and allowed her to move on from there. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt struck me...how cool is that?! I think there was a similar article not too long ago in HEM about parents who let their child paint on his walls, and it was about the same graffiti-ish look...it also caught my attention. Twice here lately...<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, while I REALLY don&#39;t mind children&#39;s art on the walls, or ON the walls themselves, Paul does. But I talked to him about it and he says he doesn&#39;t care as long as 1) it&#39;s washable marker/crayon and 2) I personally do the scrubbing before any inspection. He says it looks awful...but all I see is budding talent and personality (the culprit being my two year old free-spirit Megan). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo guess what I&#39;ll be picking up on my next shopping trip? I&#39;ll have to take some pictures to save for her. I can easily picture Megan with some sunlit attic studio in her future...unless she&#39;s on stage (here lately she&#39;s taken to standing on the table saying &quot;Ta-DA&quot; with her arms outstretched, has been standing/dancing on the table ..sometimes naked..since she could walk at 10 months). <br/>\n<br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything I need to know, I learned on my own!<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFind out what made the Top Yahoo!

And cones. And I&#39;m going to let them have double scoops. I am thinking about going back tomorrow and getting a couple more..along the lines of the ever-lasting candy bowl that was discussed awhile back. <br/>\n <br/>\nAlso...while we were out today...I bought myself a baton. I&#39;ve always enjoyed twirling one, although I&#39;m not spectacular with it. But I like twirling it. So I went and bought myself one. Sarah wants me to teach her to twirl, so I&#39;ll teach her what I know. But it occured to me that just because I&#39;m &quot;a grownup&quot; now doesn&#39;t really mean I have to leave all of childhood behind, right?<br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything I need to know, I learned on my own!<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFind out what made the Top Yahoo!

I think, <br/>\nfor me, I am almost there on lots of things but reading this list has been <br/>\nreally helpful in making that final break, you know?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been letting go of a lot of my tv controls, here. My kids are little <br/>\n(6, 5 and 3.5), and we didn&#39;t have cable (no reception) for a long time, so <br/>\nit was easy to regulate what they watched based on the kinds of videos we <br/>\nbought and rented. Now that we have cable and my oldest is 6, I had been <br/>\nrelaxing quite a bit, and I know that this list has helped me do that even <br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have been really into Kim Possible for months now--since September <br/>\nI guess when Disney released it. My oldest, Emily, is also really into <br/>\nBatman and the Justice League, which isn&#39;t on tv, but I&#39;ve been buying her <br/>\nsome coloring books (have to find a comic store) and borrowing tapes from <br/>\nthe library. I&#39;ve realized how important it is for her right now to believe <br/>\nin heroes and bravery. I think that unschooling has allowed me to see the <br/>\nvalue in what she&#39;s choosing rather than dismissing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of months ago we started inviting them to watch Star Wars with us <br/>\nsometimes at night. We&#39;ve allowed them to watch the less-scary scenes for a <br/>\nlong time now, but this time we just let them watch all of it. They really <br/>\nlike the first one when Annakin Skywalker is young--they can really <br/>\nidentify. Emily also really connected to the scene in the second one when <br/>\nYoda is teaching all the young paduans. She drew it the next day and <br/>\nstarted talking about making a movie. That night we showed her some of the <br/>\nextra stuff on some of the DVD&#39;s about storyboarding and how that&#39;s a <br/>\nreally important step in making a film. She thought it was really cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are just some of the really positive moments that stick out in my <br/>\nhead recently that have come out of my own paradigm shift, for which I&#39;m <br/>\ngrateful.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87724,"nextTopicId":87867}}
