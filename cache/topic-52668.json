I saw it with both of my older girls&#39; <br/>\nfriends and now am seeing it starting with my younger daughter&#39;s <br/>\nfriends, to some degree. She is 11 and her closest friends are 11 to 14.<br/>\n<br/>\nPartly it is fear of the kids growing up -- it is scary, when you have <br/>\na sweet little 10 yo kid, to imagine the stuff that kid is going to <br/>\nhave to deal with very very very soon. An 11 yo who is friends with <br/>\npeople of all ages (as most of our kids are) is going to soon be <br/>\nhearing stuff about sex and drugs and hearing profanity, etc., and that <br/>\ncan be so unsettling to us  parents who (understandably) want to <br/>\nprotect our kids and prolong their childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso it is not knowing, yet, how to cope with losing control over their <br/>\nkids. We HAVE to do it - we HAVE to give up control - or we&#39;re going to <br/>\nface huge rebellion issues or create huge problems in our kids&#39; lives <br/>\nthat they&#39;ll have to work out as adults. But, still, it is often really <br/>\nhard to accept that it is time to begin to let go - to begin to let the <br/>\nkids make mistakes on their own, for example, because it is a guarantee <br/>\nthat allowing freedom means allowing them to make mistakes. Many <br/>\nparents mentally go from &quot;they will make mistakes&quot; right into &quot;some <br/>\nmistakes can be deadly&quot; -- and so they become too fearful to gradually <br/>\nlet go.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughters friends - 3 or 4 girls and 4 or 5 boys  - have wanted to <br/>\nhave a big sleepover somewhere. One of the moms told her kid &quot;No way - <br/>\nyou guys are too old for sleepovers.&quot; The kids didn&#39;t get what she <br/>\nmeant - &quot;too old???&quot; I&#39;m guessing she meant too old for mixed gender <br/>\nsleepovers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess people of young teens just don&#39;t realize or can&#39;t envision that <br/>\ntheir kids and their friends will be driving in just such a few short <br/>\nyears and that they will then have their own &quot;space on wheels&quot; and can <br/>\npretty much do anything they might want to do. There is simply no such <br/>\nthing as &quot;parental control&quot; over a kid who has access to a car. So, if <br/>\nfor no other reason, it behooves parents to establish a climate of <br/>\ntrust and confidence and openness and willingness to listen to <br/>\nanything, right then while their kids are young teens. That is the <br/>\ncritical time, imo, to get things set up so that the later teen years <br/>\nwill be safer and happier. What does it tell a 12 or 13 yo boy, for <br/>\nexample, when he is told he can&#39;t be trusted to be around his friends <br/>\nwho are female, at night? Not that I don&#39;t know about the sexual <br/>\nattractions that are revving up at that age - obviously. But the kids <br/>\nand their parents can work those things out when there is trust on both <br/>\nsides, when they are talking about this stuff openly. It seems so <br/>\nobvious that &quot;control&quot; isn&#39;t going to work - and that it is better to <br/>\nbegin from early or pre-teen years to build the relationship that <br/>\nyou&#39;re going to wish for DURING the later teen years - when a <br/>\nrelationship where parents think they can simply forbid certain <br/>\nbehaviors is unrealistic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be scary to have teenagers moving out into the world where we <br/>\ncan&#39;t protect them. But when parents react to that fear by trying to <br/>\nINCREASE their control over their young teens, I think it is likely to <br/>\nhurt their relationship with their child and that is much worse. It is <br/>\nthe existence of an essentially strong relationship that is critical - <br/>\nmuch more  critical than anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of times what I see is parents increasing or fighting to keep <br/>\ncontrol in the early teen years and then the kid cutting the parent OUT <br/>\nof their real life in later teen years and adulthood.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that by way of saying that what you&#39;re dealing with is likely to be <br/>\npeople who are in this stage of reacting to the fear of their kid <br/>\ngrowing up by trying to control them as much as they can, right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how to handle it except to accept it and explain it to my <br/>\nown kid the best I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen<br/>\nOn Sunday, December 22, 2002, at 11:01 AM, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; As I said, we are in a new community, and the parents<br/>\n&gt; here are not as relaxed.

This has now turned into a really big deal,<br/>\nwith the boys mother not wanting them to be together.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps I&#39;m uncharitable in this kind of summary, but generalizing from <br/>\neveryone I went to school with, my sister&#39;s friends who got in trouble, the <br/>\nbatch of homeschoolers who have grown into teens with my kids, etc., I truly <br/>\nand honestly think this:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is much more likely that the actions cited above, making a big deal about <br/>\nhandholding, will lead to teen pregnancy or impregnation WAY sooner than a <br/>\nlighter attitude about teens growing up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there&#39;s nothing to be sneaky about, kids won&#39;t be sneaky.  IF they have to <br/>\nbe TOTALLY sneaky even to stand and lean on a wall with a kid of the opposite <br/>\nsex, if NOTHING they do is okay, and the parents won&#39;t really discuss or <br/>\nconsider it, just say NO to them, then once they&#39;re sneaking, why should they <br/>\nlimit themselves to just holding hands?  They will have an urgency and a <br/>\ndesperation (and an ignorance, in many cases) that the kids whose parents are <br/>\ncalm and open couldn&#39;t even imagine having.    <br/>\n<br/>\nPrivileges doled out in small doses make that thing (whether it&#39;s dating or <br/>\nfood or video games or anything) seem HUGEly important an valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s another example on the video game evidence.  Two boys who come over <br/>\nsometimes, the younger brothers of one of Holly&#39;s friends, always played <br/>\nvideo games every single time they came over.  They might hang out with Holly <br/>\nand their sister, too, maybe 1/3 of the time or less, or go out in the yard, <br/>\nbut their main interest here was video games. <br/>\n<br/>\nFriday they were being babysat, in my absence while I went to a movie with my <br/>\nhusband and Marty.  So Holly was here, these three kids, and two teens I <br/>\narranged with to come and hang out.  The boy of the teens was prepared to <br/>\nhelp them get video games set up, whichever system they wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey kids were in the library making up a play to videotape.  When the teens <br/>\ngot here, they went up, took a look, the kids were totally engrossed in their <br/>\nproject, and Holly didn&#39;t even think to introduce them to their babysitter <br/>\n(one of the aforementioned unschooled kids, who&#39;s 18 now).  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the teens went and played video games in Kirby&#39;s room.<br/>\n<br/>\nSide note:  The kids are 16 and 18.  A boy and a girl.  Their parents knew <br/>\nthey might be with a member of the opposite sex with no adult supervision <br/>\n(they WERE the &quot;adult supervision&quot;) but neither parent probably even thought <br/>\nfor a second.  Usually the girls, and maybe one or three other girls, is over <br/>\nhere with three to seven teenaged boys and older anyway---<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...  it turned out that althought the four younger kids broke for lunch <br/>\nthree hours into the four hours (commenting that they were surprised it was <br/>\nalready 1:00 and they should eat), they went back in the library and finished <br/>\ntheir movie, which runs about six minutes and is really funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither boy asked to play video games.  Neither said &quot;video games.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is why:<br/>\nA few weeks ago they got a Playstation.  Just a used Playstation I, but <br/>\nbecause they have video games at their house now, our house has opened up to <br/>\nlimitless possibilities, instead of just the desperate grab for video-game <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the same with mixed-groups of teenagers.  If they&#39;re used to being with <br/>\nkids of the opposite sex, they&#39;re willing to do LOTS of things when they get <br/>\none-on-one instead of just hold hands or be mushy.  And if they assume/trust <br/>\nthat they will get to be with those kids again whenever it can be arranged <br/>\nwithout the parents freaking out, they will be WAY more calm about what they <br/>\ndo or don&#39;t do on any given day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132394532,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day!","from":"Have a Nice Day! &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"bry2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Fw: Teens?","postDate":"1040583950","msgId":52722,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTgwMWMyYTllZCQyNGExOWRmMCRiNTU3NTI0NEBjZWxlcm9uMTc+","referencesHeader":"PDE4My4xM2ZmZjg3My4yYjM3NjVlOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52721,"nextInTopic":52724,"prevInTime":52721,"nextInTime":52723,"topicId":52668,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/22/02 10:38:21 AM, litlrooh@comcast.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1505879901\">In a message dated 12/22/02 10:38:21 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:litlrooh@...\">litlrooh@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; When I said the friend was afraid of going home, it was because of her <br/>\n  father&#39;s anger, not because she was worried about internet predators.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  So which is worse?   <br/>\n  What kinds of kids run away?

It&#39;s good to hear that their are other parents out there who<br/>\n  don&#39;t feel they must be with their children every minute. my daughter has<br/>\n  always had freedom to be with her friends, sometimes with me there, too, but<br/>\n  often without me. I mean in her room, or at the skating rink, Kmart, the<br/>\n  movies. I have always trusted her, and when she&#39;s needed information or help<br/>\n  she&#39;s asked me for it. As I said, we are in a new community, and the parents<br/>\n  here are not as relaxed. Not relaxed at all, and i don&#39;t get what they think<br/>\n  these kids are going to do. My daughter was &quot;caught&quot; holding hands with a 12<br/>\n  year old boy at the movies, when the mother turned who&#39;d taken them turned<br/>\n  around and they both jumped. This has now turned into a really big deal,<br/>\n  with the boys mother not wanting them to be together. I&#39;ve also heard that<br/>\n  other girls have been told not to be in my daughters bedroom when a boy is<br/>\n  there with them, too. And, friends of hers, girls, that are younger have<br/>\n  been forbidden to play with her anymore, &quot;because she&#39;s at a different<br/>\n  stage&quot;! I am mostly shocked that homeschooling, unschooling parents are this<br/>\n  way, whatever way this is. What about trust? The infamous &quot;Jenga incident&quot;,<br/>\n  was blown way out of proportion, too. It was the Truth or Dare version,<br/>\n  which wasn&#39;t really the one dd had wanted, but was the only one the store<br/>\n  had when we went to get it. Nothing happened when the game came out at a<br/>\n  party dd was having, with about 8 or 9 teens, 2 or 3 of them boys. But, the<br/>\n  two parents who had stayed (one of them completely afraid to let her<br/>\n  daughters out of her sight EVER!), freaked out. It&#39;s an adult game! it&#39;s<br/>\n  inappropriate! it&#39;s not wholesome! so, I&#39;ve been feeling like a completely<br/>\n  checked out mom, who doesn&#39;t supervise my child&#39;s every move. No one from<br/>\n  our old community was this way at all-okay, there was one weird dad who<br/>\n  insisted his daughters go everywhere together, and he&#39;d wait in the car<br/>\n  outside while they played at a friends, but we all knew he was weird.

I took him to meet a friend (Matt) yesterday ( who<br/>\n  &gt; happens to be 20, and in college) and Matt  was supposed to bring him home<br/>\n  &gt; last night.. Around 11 last night, Landon called and said they were at a<br/>\n  &gt; local coffee shop and the he decided to just spend the night with Matt.<br/>\n  That<br/>\n  &gt; was fine with me.

( well what he wanted to share, that is..<br/>\n  lol)<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I believe you said your daughter is 13. My daughter, Anna is 13 too.  Her<br/>\n  &gt; social activties include sleepovers with her friends, or days out with<br/>\n  them..<br/>\n  &gt; or them coming over here.   There are usually parents around somewhere as<br/>\n  we<br/>\n  &gt; have to chauffer them around. .lol.. but we dont hang around unless the<br/>\n  girls<br/>\n  &gt; want us to.   I am not really clear on what happened with the &quot;incidents&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; with your daughter.. You mentioned hand holding.. Gee, thats what 13 yos<br/>\n  do..<br/>\n  &gt; :-)     I dont know what is perverse at all about that.   I remember<br/>\n  playing<br/>\n  &gt; spin the bottle when I was that age..  ( gosh, what fun.. hehe)  I think<br/>\n  as<br/>\n  &gt; long as you are open and accepting of your daughter, she will give you the<br/>\n  &gt; clues as to how much she needs you around.   I took Anna to her first<br/>\n  dance<br/>\n  &gt; in October.  She wanted me to stay.  I had planned on just dropping her<br/>\n  off,<br/>\n  &gt; but staying was cool too..  There were others mothers there that had<br/>\n  INSISTED<br/>\n  &gt; on staying.    Anna asked me to stay, I think she just felt more<br/>\n  comfortable<br/>\n  &gt; with me &quot;there&quot;  And the kids all got a big kick out of disco Moma, cuz I<br/>\n  &gt; sure didnt sit around and gossip with the other mothers.about how some<br/>\n  &gt; mothers just dropped thier kids off and had no idea what goes on in thier<br/>\n  &gt; lives.  I was thinking.. What IS going on?? they are dancing for goodness<br/>\n  &gt; sakes!  . LOL  We both had a lot of fun, and I got the nickname &quot;Dancing<br/>\n  &gt; Queen&quot;  The next day, Anna went over to her friend Lauren&#39;s house and they<br/>\n  &gt; went to a Halloween party at another friends house.. I dont know the girl<br/>\n  or<br/>\n  &gt; her parents, but they had a lot of fun.   Maybe I am too trusting, but I<br/>\n  just<br/>\n  &gt; know my kids well enough to know that they will do the right thing..And if<br/>\n  &gt; the don&#39;t. they know that I am here to help them through it, not judge<br/>\n  them.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Teresa<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

In fact, I&#39;m kind of sitting with you in this boat.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Last week, my daughter and her friend were on habbo-hotel and came across a way to have habbo credits to buy furniture, etc.  It involved ordering a splashtastic card, which meant they had to supply a mailing address (personal info).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, I was sitting right behind them but I was doing cross stitch and it somehow didn&#39;t register with me that they were going to have to give personal information for this (when my daughter explained it to her brother).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, the next day, the other girl&#39;s mom called me and told me her husband receives all of her daughter&#39;s emails so that they can keep track of what she is doing.  I understand the safety issue, but I still will not do that.  (My daughter later asked me if I was monitoring *her* emails and I said &quot;no&quot;.  She was glad about that and I felt I had earned her trust).<br/>\n<br/>\n  The father went ballistic to the mother, and the mother called me (but was very reasonable about the whole thing).  I just reminded my daughter (and her friend) that its not safe to give out that kind of info.  Meanwhile, her friend was afraid to go home.   I asked that in the future whenever she has to fill out a form that she come and get me so I can check it out. She was ok with it, and we discussed the habbo hotel credits and thats when we learned that 9 British pounds was $14.00.  And from there we moved on.  No big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My point is that I too give my kids a lot of freedom, much more so than their peers have.  And I&#39;m starting to just accept the fact that other parents are going to think I&#39;m irresponsible.<br/>\n<br/>\n  They think that way for no other reason than the fundamental belief here that kids are evil until forced to be good, and that they are only capable of getting in trouble unless an adult restrains them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m getting to the point where I&#39;m not going to apologize for letting my kids have all this freedom.

Yet, my older boys are interstate atm, staying with another hs family and going to a formal ball. They have, in turn, invited the young people from that family back, in January, to spend a weekend with us and attend yet another ball. But, the father in the other family is saying no - it costs too much  to fly - this is in spite of the fact that the oldest two are 18 and 20 and are paying their own way. The father isn&#39;t discussing this - he is forbidding it! Makes my boys see red - they are used to discussing things ad infinitum in our family... I think our discussions are really valuable and erlevant to their lives now and  to their futures - to us, it is important to treat teens as reasonable beings, not as the enemy or a problem.....Leonie W. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116395969,"authorName":"Robyn Carter","from":"&quot;Robyn Carter&quot; &lt;rcarter@...&gt;","profile":"rockin_robyn03","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Fw: Teens?","postDate":"1040515361","msgId":52671,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGIwMWMyYTk0ZCQ3MjlhODNhMCRkYjhmZmVhOUBkOXg4czI+","referencesHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWMyYTk0OCQ4Y2VkNWEyMCRkYjhmZmVhOUBkOXg4czI+IDwwMDFiMDFjMmE5NDkkY2I0MmJhZDAkYjU1NzUyNDRAY2VsZXJvbjE3Pg=="},"prevInTopic":52669,"nextInTopic":52685,"prevInTime":52670,"nextInTime":52672,"topicId":52668,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kristen, I love you!

In fact, I&#39;m kind of sitting with you in this boat.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week, my daughter and her friend were on habbo-hotel and came across a way to have habbo credits to buy furniture, etc.  It involved ordering a splashtastic card, which meant they had to supply a mailing address (personal info).<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I was sitting right behind them but I was doing cross stitch and it somehow didn&#39;t register with me that they were going to have to give personal information for this (when my daughter explained it to her brother).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the next day, the other girl&#39;s mom called me and told me her husband receives all of her daughter&#39;s emails so that they can keep track of what she is doing.  I understand the safety issue, but I still will not do that.  (My daughter later asked me if I was monitoring *her* emails and I said &quot;no&quot;.  She was glad about that and I felt I had earned her trust).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe father went ballistic to the mother, and the mother called me (but was very reasonable about the whole thing).  I just reminded my daughter (and her friend) that its not safe to give out that kind of info.  Meanwhile, her friend was afraid to go home.   I asked that in the future whenever she has to fill out a form that she come and get me so I can check it out. She was ok with it, and we discussed the habbo hotel credits and thats when we learned that 9 British pounds was $14.00.  And from there we moved on.  No big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that I too give my kids a lot of freedom, much more so than their peers have.  And I&#39;m starting to just accept the fact that other parents are going to think I&#39;m irresponsible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey think that way for no other reason than the fundamental belief here that kids are evil until forced to be good, and that they are only capable of getting in trouble unless an adult restrains them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m getting to the point where I&#39;m not going to apologize for letting my kids have all this freedom.  Apparently G-d thinks I have what it takes to parent the children he gave to me.  So boo hiss on those who disagree.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Robyn Carter <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, December 21, 2002 6:27 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Fw: Teens?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: &quot;Robyn Carter&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rcarter@...\">rcarter@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:The_Unschooling_Forum@yahoogroups.com\">The_Unschooling_Forum@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, December 21, 2002 12:54 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Teens?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Happy Holidays to all you unschooling parents and families!
