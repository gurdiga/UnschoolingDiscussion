I think it beats school any day<br/>\n  &gt; also!  But I think my son is still getting used to unschooling and<br/>\n  &gt; sometimes mentions school. although less and less.  He went to<br/>\n  &gt; Montessori for two years and ps 1/2 year. I pulled him out of ps in<br/>\n  &gt; February when after volunteering I got a whiff of what was really<br/>\n  &gt; going on! I didn&#39;t think 6 yo&#39;s were capable of that much violence!<br/>\n  &gt; And I only saw two hours worth! Anyway, we started homeschooling out<br/>\n  &gt; of necessity and stayed with it because of love.  We&#39;ve been<br/>\n  &gt; unschooling for about five months and i&#39;ve been back to work for<br/>\n  &gt; three months.  He and his little brother stay with my mother.  She&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt; a HUGE help and very supportive but I don&#39;t know her take on<br/>\n  &gt; unschooling yet. Did your kids go to ps? Did you have any issues<br/>\n  &gt; with them about going back to school? what about boredom?<br/>\n  &gt; Tanya :)<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; I do.  I go in very early in the morning, my boys don&#39;t get up<br/>\n  &gt; until around 10-11 everyday, and I get home between 2-3 PM, so from<br/>\n  &gt; mid-afternoon until around 10 PM I&#39;m with them constantly.  They can<br/>\n  &gt; call me as many times as they want while I&#39;m at work, and a lot of<br/>\n  &gt; days I take off early (like today...yippppeeee!!!)just to get back<br/>\n  &gt; home.  On the weekends we go like hell, plus I get 4 weeks vacation,<br/>\n  &gt; and probably the most important factor is I put VERY little energy<br/>\n  &gt; into my job, so I&#39;ll have plenty left for the important stuff at<br/>\n  &gt; home. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; I do most of my posting on message boards and lists while I&#39;m at<br/>\n  &gt; work, or sometimes at night if the boys are gone.  When I&#39;m with my<br/>\n  &gt; boys, they are my focus.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; It&#39;s not an ideal situation, but it&#39;s working out well for us so<br/>\n  &gt; far.

Do things you like to do while he&#39;s around.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 year old just came in and asked who I was writing to, and I gave him a quick run down on your questions and worries.  Here&#39;s his response: &quot;Tell her not to worry.  Learning stuff is easy.  All you have to do is see something you like and do it.&quot;  I think that&#39;s unschooling in a nutshell.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also recommends keeping lots of pencils and drawing paper around, lol.

My mind doesn&#39;t work in dates and times, I kinda go by the &#39;feel&#39; of passing time, lol.  I think it&#39;s 4 years.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Did your kids go to ps?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup.  My oldest for 10 years (including preschool) and my youngest for 7.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Did you have any issues <br/>\n&gt; with them about going back to school?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not at all.  After the experiences my kids had in school, you couldn&#39;t drag them back with a bulldozer.  There is nothing on this earth that would cause my kids to want to go back to school.  A little while back all my FIL&#39;s grandkids were at their house and he was handing out money for good grades on report cards.  (We didn&#39;t know it was report card day, we just happened to be there.)  When he got to my youngest he said, &quot;Sorry, no report card, no money&quot;.  (There&#39;s a lot of history behind all of this, but in a nutshell I had a &#39;talk&#39; with him and told him to either get on board with what we were doing, or stay out of the way.  He stays out of the way, for the most part.)  Dylan just grinned at him (he&#39;s used to grandpa&#39;s schoolish insinuations) and said, &quot;Going to school isn&#39;t worth money, grandpa&quot;.  He wasn&#39;t falling for grandpa&#39;s bribery.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;what about boredom?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What about it?  I&#39;ve never thought boredom was something to panic over.  I think sometimes boredom is necessary to help our minds move onto something new.  Sure, my kids get bored sometimes, but it never lasts long.  I see boredom as an opportunity to introduce something different in their lives.  Or to revisit something we haven&#39;t been into for awhile.  Usually when we&#39;ve left a certain something behind and then come back to it at a later date, there is always something new about it because we&#39;ve learned other things in the mean time and a whole new set of connections can be made.  Things that didn&#39;t make sense before, or that were ignored because we had no knowledge base to pull from, suddenly fall into place because of other, new connections that hadn&#39;t previously existed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoredom isn&#39;t something to fear, it can be utilized to your advantage as long as you don&#39;t panic, lol.  I&#39;ve found that I can usually strew our way out of a boredom attack.  I can pull out things that have been buried under a mountain of other stuff, and present them strewingly (how&#39;s that for a word?) as something new and exciting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone emailed me a few days ago, asking how they are supposed to know what to strew.  My answer was simple: LISTEN TO THEM.  BE with them.  Pay attention to them.  It doesn&#39;t mean to get too specific with strewing; kids will make connections that someone else may never think of, but by hanging out with them we can get a pretty good idea of what they&#39;re into and what catches their interest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyway, back to boredom....the best boredom buster there is, IMO, is getting out of the house!  Go somewhere.  Do something.  Drag yourself up out of the rut and have some fun!  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t sweat boredom.  It&#39;s a pretty easy fix once you get the hang of it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n___________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign-up for Ads Free at Mail.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm\">http://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":153743844,"authorName":"tjreynoso","from":"&quot;tjreynoso&quot; &lt;tjreynoso@...&gt;","profile":"tjreynoso","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: work and unschool","postDate":"1074790075","msgId":89707,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJ1b3VycitlZDZnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTIxMTMxOTUzLjkzMzc2LnFtYWlsQG1haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":89625,"nextInTopic":89717,"prevInTime":89706,"nextInTime":89708,"topicId":89598,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Lyle and Jane, How long have you unschooled?

I think it beats school any day <br/>\nalso!  But I think my son is still getting used to unschooling and <br/>\nsometimes mentions school. although less and less.  He went to <br/>\nMontessori for two years and ps 1/2 year. I pulled him out of ps in <br/>\nFebruary when after volunteering I got a whiff of what was really <br/>\ngoing on! I didn&#39;t think 6 yo&#39;s were capable of that much violence! <br/>\nAnd I only saw two hours worth! Anyway, we started homeschooling out <br/>\nof necessity and stayed with it because of love.  We&#39;ve been <br/>\nunschooling for about five months and i&#39;ve been back to work for <br/>\nthree months.  He and his little brother stay with my mother.  She&#39;s <br/>\na HUGE help and very supportive but I don&#39;t know her take on <br/>\nunschooling yet. Did your kids go to ps? Did you have any issues <br/>\nwith them about going back to school? what about boredom? <br/>\nTanya :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I do.
