The books <br/>\nthat didn&#39;t sell were returned to me in a horrible condition. <br/>\nBarbara claims that she packed them herself, but she used no packing <br/>\nmaterial and put them in a box that was much too large. All 24 books <br/>\nare in such bad condition that I can&#39;t sell them now. When I left <br/>\nthe conference, they were neatly packaged in the box I sent them in <br/>\nand they were brand spanking new. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome have food on them, bent corners, water drops, marks, scratches <br/>\nand scuffs as if they were used as hockey pucks. This damage had to <br/>\nhave happened before they were shipped. I&#39;m not exaggerating here. <br/>\nThe box arrived and was smashed in on all edges due to no packaging <br/>\nmaterial. The books were haphazardly tossed into the box. Barbara&#39;s <br/>\nbad packaging and bad handling before packaging cost me $365 and she <br/>\nsays HSC isn&#39;t responsible. No, I think Barbara should be <br/>\nresponsible, but she won&#39;t even respond to my email. She suggested <br/>\nthat I file a claim with UPS, but they did nothing but deliver a <br/>\npoorly packaged box of damaged books.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy contract also states that they will have a check to me by <br/>\nSeptember 30th at the latest for books sold and my personal eating <br/>\nexpenses. It&#39;s October 23rd and I have no check yet. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeeting Pam and a few others was great for me, but I will never have <br/>\nanything to do with HSC again unless Barbara leaves as coordinator. <br/>\n<br/>\nPam, do you happen to have email addresses for the other speakers <br/>\nwho were selling books? I&#39;m going to look each one up from the <br/>\nwebsite, but just thought I&#39;d ask in case you already have them. I&#39;d <br/>\nlike to know if any of the others had similar experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nlove, Valerie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, pam sorooshian <br/>\n&lt;pamsoroosh@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The HSC website has posted the Request for Proposal forms for the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>2005 <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; conference.  Anyone interested in speaking at the next event <br/>\n </span></blockquote>should <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; fill one out and send to Barbara at Barbara.david1@c... as soon <br/>\n&gt; as possible.
