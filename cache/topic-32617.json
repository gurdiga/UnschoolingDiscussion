I have a story.<br/>\nYesterday, Joe had on his cargo pants (khaki colored). we were going out to<br/>\nthe CSA farm to see the new chicks and my herbs. I started looking for mine,<br/>\n(green not khaki) because they are my &quot;farm pants&quot; I ALWAYS wear them out<br/>\nhtere &#39;cause I don&#39;t mind them getting so dirty.<br/>\nNow Joe HATES to wear similar clothes. I don&#39;t know, maybe it emasculates<br/>\nhim, whatever. He&#39;s afraid we&#39;ll wind up likke the retired couples we see on<br/>\ntheir huge motor cycles with matching leathers and helmets  that are linked<br/>\nby an intercom. So he says to me could you wear something different?, I<br/>\nthought about it and wanted to wear them and since I don&#39;t care if we look<br/>\nsimilar I thought it should be up to him to change his pants. So I told him<br/>\nthat.<br/>\nJoe, if you have a problem with something, don&#39;t ask ME to change to fix<br/>\nYOUR problem.<br/>\nBIG FIGHT.<br/>\nHis response was &quot;If you really loved me, you&#39;d change.&quot;<br/>\nNow I can laugh about that. (AFTER it was talked over.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Elissa Cleaveland<br/>\n&quot;It is nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction<br/>\nhave<br/>\nnot yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry.&quot; A.
