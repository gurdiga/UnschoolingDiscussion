She is very condemning though and belittles <br/>\nthe kids when they don&#39;t answer or get it wrong.  She also does this only if <br/>\nI am not around!<br/>\nShe would attack my kids and I didn&#39;t even know about it.  One time, she was <br/>\nbabysitting (a few years ago, when we first started unschooling and my kids <br/>\nwere all too young to stay home by themselves) while I had a doctors <br/>\nappointment.  Since one of my children would have been in third grade that <br/>\nyear, she sat him down to see if he knew cursive (he didn&#39;t, since he had <br/>\nnever written in cursive at all).  The schools here teach it in second grade, <br/>\nso she got very angry.  She just happened to be yelling &quot;What do you mean, <br/>\nyou don&#39;t know this?!!  You should know this by now!<br/>\nYou are in third grade, you are not a baby!  You aren&#39;t-------&quot;  I stepped in <br/>\nand stopped her.  From experience I knew that she was going to call him <br/>\nstupid or worse next.  We had a big discussion about her not ever testing my <br/>\nkids or talking to them in that tone of voice.  She got extremely angry with <br/>\nme, yelled a lot and then didn&#39;t talk to me for a few weeks (typical behavior <br/>\nwhen I confront her).  The testing stopped for a while, but then she started <br/>\ntrying to &quot;sneak it in&quot;.  As the boys got older, they were able to shrug off <br/>\nher &quot;attitude&quot; but my youngest daughter was easier to pick on for awhile.  So <br/>\nmy youngest two just decided not to be around grandma anymore, not unless the <br/>\nwhole family went.  It really hurt her feelings and she claims that I turned <br/>\nmy kids against her, she refuses to see what she is doing.  Both of the <br/>\nyounger ones have gotten older and wiser and will now say &quot;I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nanswer any question&quot; or in the case of my late reader 11 year old daughter <br/>\n(she didn&#39;t start reading until 9 1/2 years old) &quot;I don&#39;t want to read to <br/>\nyou&quot;.  It makes my mother mad, but she accepts it.  Now she attacks their <br/>\nattitude sometimes (she doesn&#39;t think children should tell adults no).  So my <br/>\nkids still don&#39;t like being alone with her, but it is getting easier as they <br/>\nget older, since they are feeling as &quot;big&quot; as she is (even my youngest is <br/>\nvery, very tall for her age) so they don&#39;t feel as bullied anymore.  However, <br/>\nI don&#39;t make my kids go over there by themselves.  I would rather hurt my <br/>\nmothers feelings than hurt my children and make them feel intimidated.<br/>\nTammy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This made me think of my fil, a controlling, judgmental type <br/>\n&gt; ex-schoolteacher.

So when <br/>\nthey come over, he tries to quiz them to see what they know. <br/>\nFortunately, the kids kind of just roll their eyes at this.
