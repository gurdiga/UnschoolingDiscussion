(I got rid of <br/>\nthe checkbook. I just use cash. BINGO!)

Even if<br/>\nwe end up in jobs we love, all of life is not fun and games.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that, if your life is NOT all fun and games, you need a new <br/>\nlife----or at least new priorities! &lt;G&gt; You&#39;ll see a tendency to do &quot;necessary <br/>\napplications&quot; when the child is ready.

I hate <br/>\nthe words &quot;work&quot; and &quot;chore&quot;. There are things that need to be done in order to <br/>\nmake your life more joyful and pleasant----like clean clothes and clean <br/>\nsheets and clean dishes and a stocked refrigerator and clean toilets and vacuumed <br/>\ncarpets. These things can be done begrudgingly or joyfully. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re making children do these things that are important to YOU &quot;just <br/>\nbecause&quot;, the children will learn that chores suck and they won&#39;t want to do <br/>\nthem. If you model giving, loving care of your property and if you take care of it <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s important to the house&#39;s and to your well-being, the children <br/>\nwill take ownership and act accordingly. But THEY NEED TO SEE YOU MODEL THAT <br/>\nBEHAVIOUR!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;So far modeling is as far as I go.

And I&#39;d also talk out loud: &quot;I love clean sheets at night. I&#39;m going <br/>\nto wash mine today. Do you want to bring down your sheets too?&quot; and tell them <br/>\nwhen you tuck them in how nice the sheets smell and feel.  &quot;I&#39;m going out to <br/>\ngarden.&quot; If they show up, just talk about how much you love homegrown tomatoes <br/>\nand cucumbers and how much you like providing them.  While you&#39;re folding <br/>\nclothes, talk about how small or suddenly HUGE their shirts are (that amazes me <br/>\nstill!) and how much you love having clean clothes. JOYFULLY model the <br/>\nbehaviour-----complaining while dusting won&#39;t accomplish it!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.
