I hope and pray <br/>\n that your friend will be ok, and that she makes the court see, and he gets <br/>\n his just reward. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie,<br/>\n     She has been keeping a log of everything that he says and does.  Her <br/>\nlawyer has asked that I start doing the same (he kept calling me all the <br/>\ntime, when they first broke up, pretending to need someone to talk to; <br/>\nhowever his conversations kept going to the subject of sex.  My friend said <br/>\nthat he had become &quot;fixated&quot; with me about a year before he left her.  She <br/>\nwas afraid that he was trying to get together with me.  I was very <br/>\nembarrassed at the things he would say on the phone, so my husband took the <br/>\nphone from me one night and told him to quit calling me.) since I have <br/>\nstarted keeping her kids on the weekends.  She just began a new job where she <br/>\nworks from Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for 15 hour shifts (from 3:00 pm the <br/>\nprevious day to 7:00 am the next morning, then she goes home and gets a few <br/>\nhours of sleep and has to be back to work at 3:00 pm again.).  I have the <br/>\nkids from Friday after school until she picks them up at 7:20 am Monday <br/>\nmorning to take them to school.  She took this new job because the pay will <br/>\nbe fantastic (she is a COTA----Certified Occupation Therapy Assistant) and <br/>\nshe has all week to spend with the kids.  Anyway her ex is really ticked, <br/>\nbecause he thinks that he should have the kids while she works on weekends, <br/>\nso he is causing a stink about it.  So now I also have to keep a log of every <br/>\ntime he calls here to talk to me or one of the kids.<br/>\n    Thanks for telling me about not changing her number.  She had just <br/>\ndecided to try changing her pager number so that he can&#39;t keep paging her all <br/>\nthe time.  I will pass on what you said to her about that.<br/>\n     Unfortunately she can&#39;t afford to buy a computer or get on the internet <br/>\n(she just graduated from college in December, and she is just now getting a <br/>\ngood job.  Before she was only making $7.00 an hour, and her ex was not <br/>\ngiving her child support. (He was supposed to be, but our court system here <br/>\nis really slow about going after the dads that are failing to pay).  They <br/>\njust took her off of food stamps and free lunches for her kids at school.  <br/>\nShe is feeling like she is sinking right now, and it really bothers her to <br/>\nwatch her husband take off on vacations, buy a new computer and get on the <br/>\ninternet, go out and spend hundreds of dollars on CDs at Barnes & Nobles, and <br/>\nbuy the kids expensive presents every time she turns around.  She can barely <br/>\nmake ends meet, and she feels like there is no way that she can compete with <br/>\neverything he keeps getting the kids.<br/>\nHowever, even with all the presents, her kids really don&#39;t want to go see <br/>\ntheir dad, because of the way he acts.  She has been very good with <br/>\nvisitation however (even though that means that she has to spend a few hours <br/>\nin his presence also, since he only has visitation with her supervision).  <br/>\nShe always makes sure that he sees the kids at least twice a week, and <br/>\nsometimes ever 3 or 4 times.  She is trying to give him the benefit of the <br/>\ndoubt through all of this (he claims that he has changed, and needs to be <br/>\ngiven the chance to prove it) and not keep the kids from their father.  <br/>\nHowever, with all the things he has pulled lately (like taking her back to <br/>\ncourt to get custody of the kids, and then lying to people about her <br/>\nreputation), it is really getting hard for her to keep it up.  Anyway, since <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t have a computer hooked to the internet, I can&#39;t give her your <br/>\ne-maid address. <br/>\nI will pass on your messages though, and she can use mine if there is <br/>\nanything she needs to talk to you about.  <br/>\n     Well thanks for all your advice.

He had an affair and his behavior was very <br/>\n&quot;odd&quot; in other ways.

She thought it was fun when they first met, but after <br/>\nthey had kids, she wanted him to grow up.  Well, when he went off his <br/>\nmedicine (for being manic) again, over a year ago, he started doing all those <br/>\n&quot;weird&quot; things again.  He got arrested again a few times, then ended up in <br/>\nthe Physciatric Ward (he voluntarily went in).  During this time, he ran into <br/>\nthe girl that he had the affair with years earlier, and they started up <br/>\nagain.  He asked my friend for a divorce, then moved in with the other girl.<br/>\n     Well, after he got back on the medicine, he asked for my friend to get <br/>\nback with him (even though he was still living with the other girl, and had <br/>\neven asked her to marry him).  My friend refused, saying that she and the <br/>\nchildren couldn&#39;t live with his &quot;wild outbursts&quot; anymore.  (He gets very <br/>\nviolent and abusive when he&#39;s manic).<br/>\n     Well, to make a long story short, he has married this other girl (who <br/>\nhad had a good job and has saved back alot of money-----poor girl, he is <br/>\ntaking her for as much as she has got!).  Now he is taking my friend to <br/>\ncourt, to try to get the kids.  He has behaved very badly to my 17 year old <br/>\nson while he was babysitting (kept calling every few minutes and yelling at <br/>\nthe kids, because he thought that he should have them not the <br/>\nbabysitter-----but because of his &quot;manic&quot; past, he isn&#39;t allowed to have them <br/>\nwithout supervision).  Well, he has &quot;conned&quot; and &quot;manipulated&quot; enough people <br/>\ninto believing that there is NOTHING wrong with him, that my friend is a <br/>\nlier, that she leaves the kids with no babysitter (my 17 year old son was <br/>\nthat babysitter, and he is almost 18), and that he is stable and a great <br/>\nfather.  The scary thing is, that it seems to be working!!!!  He is trying to <br/>\nget out of paying child support, medical bills or anything else.  He is <br/>\nconstantly calling my friend (at work, at home----sometimes every 10 to 15 <br/>\nminutes!, he even pages her when she is out somewhere!)  She is getting very <br/>\nparanoid.  Although he isn&#39;t quite &quot;stalking&quot; her, he is driving her crazy, <br/>\nand he isn&#39;t letting her live her own life, although he sure is going on with <br/>\nhis!!   I am beginning to get  a taste of what the law does in these cases, <br/>\nas he seems to be getting all the breaks, and she is getting none!  Oh well, <br/>\nwe will see what happens on their court date.<br/>\n     Thank you for telling me your story.  It has sure opened up my eyes!  I <br/>\nsure hope that he leaves you alone after this!

Good luck on looking up <br/>\n stalking.  I sure hope you find out something that will help you!<br/>\n Tami &gt;&gt;<br/>\nTami-<br/>\nThe laws on stalking are so nondescript. Police are usually defiant about <br/>\ndealing with women in stalking situations, for women &quot;make up things, are so <br/>\noveremotional, want to get back at the ex, and don&#39;t think before they <br/>\nreact&quot;. Believe me, when my exhusband went to my son&#39;s school and WALKED into <br/>\nHIS classroom, these were some of the answers that I heard as to why I was <br/>\ncalling the police. It is something that police DO NOT want to deal with. I <br/>\ncalled one night (around 7p, just afterdark) because I was having someone <br/>\nknock on my back door, leave cute packages, and run. The packages contained <br/>\nthings such as my daughter&#39;s first birthday invite, my son&#39;s school homework, <br/>\nmy car registration... The police first said that they would be out when they <br/>\ncould come around, and when they got to my apt (after midnight), said many <br/>\nthings. That someone was going thru my trash (my car registration? Stacie&#39;s <br/>\nbirthday was 9 months previous), that since I lived in a poor section of <br/>\ntown, they could not say it was him, and that I should just get on with my <br/>\nlife and leave him alone. What!!! My ex was in criminal justice classes, and <br/>\nwhen I had him arrested he was one semester away from academy. I am firm in <br/>\nmy belief that he knows what lines to walk, and exactly how to do it, because <br/>\ncriminal psychology was already studied. He knows what he is doing. I have <br/>\nnot told him that we are homeschooling. I am hoping that he will just think <br/>\nhtat the children are at another school, and give me some freedom for my <br/>\nchildren. I have become a women&#39;s rights advocate, and I want to have women <br/>\nknow that it is possible for that real great guy that is just sonosey, and <br/>\ndoes not want them to dress (or behave, whatever) a certian way, is the first <br/>\nsteps. My goal is to make women aware that men (and women) are out there, and <br/>\nthat these people will hurt you! <br/>\nSorry, I went off in my little world. I do that every now and again. <br/>\nMy children want lunch, I should feed them.<br/>\nStephanie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"FreeSchool@xxx.xxx","from":"FreeSchool@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"gYgKdKM7iJ4xyitHg3RuwzoBkiVdylSEw2HNp397hfCnvc26c5V_ntN7ig5vyjlgAB1IxmKZchfT","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: More late night antics","postDate":"938237498","msgId":3288,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMjQuMzI4OC45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3261,"nextInTopic":3292,"prevInTime":3287,"nextInTime":3289,"topicId":3092,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/24/99 10:38:45 AM Central Daylight Time, LifesLearn@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1605832478\">In a message dated 9/24/99 10:38:45 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LifesLearn@...\">LifesLearn@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; He is a stalker, and I KNEW this when we got <br/>\n together.

He did say that he doesn&#39;t care if we all stay up late, if we <br/>\nreally keep quiet so that he can get some sleep before work.  Of course, I <br/>\nagreed upon this!  This is what I have been trying to do all along!<br/>\n     Unfortunately, he added on the end of the conversation, that we should <br/>\nstill get up at a &quot;reasonable&quot; hour.  When I asked him what this was, he <br/>\nmentioned between 7:00 am and 8:00 am.  Of course, this seemed to begin the <br/>\nwhole conversation all over again, so I almost felt like I had gotten <br/>\nabsolutely nowhere!!!  Anyway, we talked all over again, how the words <br/>\n&quot;reasonable hour&quot; means different things to different people.  Anyway, I did <br/>\nstress that as long as we accomplished everything in our day, that someone <br/>\nthat rises and goes to bed early does, that is shouldn&#39;t matter.  He did <br/>\nagree to this, but he still things people like me are weird!  :)  Oh well, I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t quite deny that, since I probably am!  Ha ha.<br/>\n     We also discussed his temper.  He said that he hadn&#39;t realized that he <br/>\nhad been yelling like that, but that he hadn&#39;t gotten used to the earlier <br/>\nhours of his new job yet, and that he has been feeling really tired in the <br/>\nmorning.  He said that he sometimes felt like he was fighting off sleep on <br/>\nthe way to work!  I told him that he needed to let me and the kids know that, <br/>\nso we could let him go to bed even earlier, and we could be quiet alot <br/>\nearlier in the evening.<br/>\n     I was very happy with the turnout of our discussion tonight.  I know <br/>\nthat we will still probably have to &quot;work&quot; at it and adapt to each others <br/>\nschedule, but at least we finally know where the other person stands.  I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t aware that he thought that he could change me (after 19 years) and I <br/>\nimagine that he is a little dissapointed to find out that I probably won&#39;t <br/>\nchange.  However, we did agree to compromise at times, and to be sensitive to <br/>\nhow the other person feels about things.  We also agreed to try and accept <br/>\nthose things about each other that are so different.  <br/>\n     I know that this doesn&#39;t mean there won&#39;t ever be any more problems, but <br/>\nI do feel like we are back to communicating and getting along.  Tonight was <br/>\nso much better!  The kids are playing in a different bedroom (he said that <br/>\neven when they were quiet, in the bedroom above ours, he could still hear <br/>\nevery tiny noise.  He said that that was what was keeping him up at nights), <br/>\nso that they don&#39;t keep their dad awake.  He hasn&#39;t yelled or came out of the <br/>\nbedroom even once tonight, so so far, so good!   Thanks for all the advice <br/>\nand shared woes!<br/>\nTami</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"APPLEKJF@aol.com","from":"APPLEKJF@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ceWFnw1vD2I9n9WZ58ni4wxEuEJRUOUjtKgR12zmC0PeX4G5Lh2uXO1GG1kheufkzzpI0msOhQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"More late night antics","postDate":"937892440","msgId":3092,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMTQuMzA5Mi45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3111,"prevInTime":3091,"nextInTime":3093,"topicId":3092,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ok, Ok, so a lot of us seem to have the same problem here, hmmmmmm.

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1710463346\">Ok, Ok, so a lot of us seem to have the same problem here, hmmmmmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I don&#39;t have to worry about waking my husband up, he would put a <br/>\nhurtin&#39; on me!  I don&#39;t have to worry about having to jump in the sack with <br/>\nhim when he turns in, he doesn&#39;t usually ask me to.  So, I have those two <br/>\nproblems licked.  Of course, I am not the kind of woman who will wait on him <br/>\nhand and foot either, so maybe he grown to accept that I am going to do what <br/>\nI am going to do.  It does help that he is a loner type of guy, and he likes <br/>\nto sleep... a lot if he can help it.  That gives me some slack when I need <br/>\nit, which is a lot, because I am extremely independent.  So, if he is just <br/>\nlooking for me to sit or lie next to him out of habit, I am not playing <br/>\nalong.  That is when I feel like furniture.  And since I have started working <br/>\nagain, I don&#39;t feel like furniture as much anymore :o)  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe will just throw some attitude around till I corner him and make him spill <br/>\nhis guts.  Then I will let him know how selfish he is and let him know how <br/>\nmuch I love him!<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, families are complex things.  It is hard to get everything right all of <br/>\nthe time, or even part of the time.  But I think homeschooling does put an <br/>\ninteresting, more complex twist on things.  Those of us at home with the <br/>\nkiddies can get pretty overwhelmed by around 7:00 Pm.  we have NO time to <br/>\nourselves all day, not even to go potty!!!!  We do ache for time to de-stress <br/>\nand absorb what our day has brought us...anticipating the next and things we <br/>\nneed to address or change.  Things we need to get done.  Growth phases of the <br/>\nkids to figure out and very high levels of patience to maintain.  And who are <br/>\nwe in all of this?  Are we only our children or our spouses?  Or do we have <br/>\nan identity and interests unique to ourselves?  I don&#39;t think I gave up being <br/>\nan individual and a person when I got married and had children... I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink I ever agreed to totally eliminate any sense of self.  Though I have <br/>\nbeen the first to sacrifice my needs and wants in support of my spouse and <br/>\nchildren.  There are times when that is just not feasable or warranted.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo solutions here.  I have no answers.  Just keep honestly communicating.  It <br/>\nis nothing to lose a marriage over.  But you can&#39;t lose your own identity for <br/>\nyour marriage either.  If your mate loves and respects you, they will allow <br/>\nyou your space and come up with other ways to make time together.  I only <br/>\nknow to respond in defense when I feel myself slipping away and I feel as <br/>\nthough I can&#39;t identify myself.  Like someone said, &quot;if Mama aint happy, aint <br/>\nno body happy!&quot;.  And that is true in my house.  dad got a call at work today <br/>\nabout his selfish, defiant son from his frantic, I have had it, wife.  <br/>\nNeedless to say a family conference was held when he got home!  And I let <br/>\nthem all have it!  We had the &quot;more joy in giving than receiving <br/>\nconversation&quot; as I glared at my hubby &lt;g&gt;.  And more of the &quot;stop taking <br/>\nadvantage my patience and commitment to you&quot; and &quot;do you see the socks on the <br/>\nfloor or dirty dishes in the sink, who you leavin&#39; em for????&quot;  Younger Ds of <br/>\ncourse starts having to go the bathroom in fear of the pending nothing.  But <br/>\nit generally takes mom having a hairy kiniption fit to get the guys <br/>\nmotivated.  And that saddens me greatly.  Makes me wonder if I have any value <br/>\nother than to be taken advantage of and be manipulated into being a household <br/>\nservant.  When I work, and am doing things publically for work, I get a lot <br/>\nof credit and encouragement and thanks for the work I do.  But I wish I got <br/>\nmore of that at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I would say we as parents, definitely have to take our time to heal <br/>\nourselves, reflect, look forward, and just be ourselves ... if we can <br/>\nremember who we are.  I am going to set up date night with hubby once a <br/>\nweek...that is probably enough for him &lt;g&gt;.  I do enjoy talking with him and <br/>\nspending time with him.  I am sure we can commit to carving out a notch of <br/>\ntime everyday while I am preparing dinner or something like that.  If we are <br/>\ncommitted to each other, we will make it work.  Not me making it work for <br/>\nhim.  Us making it work for each other.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that helps is that I am an eternal optimist and know there is <br/>\nindeed a solution to every problem I face.  Though it may not manifest itself <br/>\nto me at that moment, in due time and with patience, it will work itself out. <br/>\n So I needn&#39;t freak out nealry as much as I used to.  I only need to get <br/>\nonline with this list, visit a friend, go shopping, talk to my mom, or just <br/>\nspend time in the tub with my candles and a bottle of Zima once in a great <br/>\nwhile &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I have to go back to work and get something accomplished or I will be <br/>\nspending more time with my hubby than I think, hahaha.  A grantwriter who <br/>\nwrites no grants is of no good use ... wouldn&#39;t ya say?<br/>\n<br/>\nKim</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3362,"nextTopicId":3344}}
