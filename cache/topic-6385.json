My name<br/>\nis Michele<br/>\nand I live in New Zealand with my husband and two daughters who are 6<br/>\nand 4.<br/>\nWe have until just recently followed a semi-structured approach to our<br/>\nhomeschooling life, producing a worried Mum and two fed up girls!  I was<br/>\ncontinually fretting about scope and sequences and worring about whether<br/>\nthe girls were learning everything on time or not etc, etc!!!! Anyway we<br/>\nhave finished our school holiday season over here and saw during that<br/>\ntime how much our girls have blossomed in their learning and in attitude<br/>\nas well. It made us really examine what we were doing and so......we<br/>\ndecided to change. The first thing we did was order the Unschooling<br/>\nHandbook by Mary Griffith (?), and since then we haven&#39;t looked back. My<br/>\neldest is reading us and our library out of books and has also (on her<br/>\nown) started obsessively finding anything out about the Holocaust and<br/>\nWW2 that she can. This is a complete turn around for her!!!!!!!! Dh and<br/>\nI are happier than we have been in ages and its thanks to a new<br/>\nunschooling attitude.<br/>\nSo that is part of our homeschooling story and I look forward to<br/>\nlearning more and more thru this list. If anyone can recommend any other<br/>\nunschooling books to read<br/>\nI would be very grateful.<br/>\nThanks for reading,<br/>\nMichele.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6431,"nextTopicId":6439}}
