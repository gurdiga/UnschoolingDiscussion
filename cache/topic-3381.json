I<br/>\nthink the plan was to cut an opening near the bottom of the bottle, then<br/>\ntape it shut with a good quality tape. Of course, you could fill it with<br/>\nshredded paper, etc. to keep everything from bouncing around.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Does anyone have any recycle/craft ideas for plastic soda bottles, 20<br/>\noz and 1 liter?
