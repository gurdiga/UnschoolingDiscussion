Promises to improve foreign relations with Hawaii.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;8. Runs a series of attack ads against Martin Sheen&#39;s character on &quot;The West Wing.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;7. His #1 choice to work on his cabinet is &quot;That Bob Vila guy.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;6. Outstanding record as Governor of Rhode Island nullified by the fact that no one really cares.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;5. Anybody mentions Washington, he asks, &quot;The state or the DC thingie?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;4. At the debates, answers every question with a snarled, &quot;You wanna wrestle?!?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3. Vows to put an end to the war in Pokemon and free the Pikachu refugees once and for all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2. Says the Pledge of Allegiance as quickly as possible, then shouts, &quot;I win!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1. On the very first question of the debate, he attempts to use a LIFELINE.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13189,"nextTopicId":13193}}
