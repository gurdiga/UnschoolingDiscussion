An older dog. And get a crate. Sign up for obedience classes, <br/>\n4-H--whatever. If she&#39;ll get involved with a local SHOW breeder (not some <br/>\nbackyard breeder), she&#39;ll have a mentor--and a new hobby. There may even be a <br/>\nbreeder in the local kennel club who&#39;d be willing to part with an older champion <br/>\nthat she could show in junior showmanship and conformation. The breeder will help <br/>\nher with grooming and training and handling. She could apprentice a <br/>\nprofessional handler and exchange &quot;kennel grunt help&quot; for hands-on experience with show <br/>\ndogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nEndless possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73131,"nextTopicId":73151}}
