Pretty authentic, or so Noni and the other folks from the &quot;old<br/>\ncountry&quot; have told me.  But, although I&#39;m married to one (well, honesty must<br/>\nprevail, two but just not at the same time &lt;g&gt;) and have the dark hair and<br/>\nolive complexion I don&#39;t claim to &quot;be&quot; Italian.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda, pondering Molto Betsy or Molto Lynda.
