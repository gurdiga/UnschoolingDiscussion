If <br/>\nyou haven&#39;t yet read the Resolution, please do so and discuss it with <br/>\nyour friends and family.  To whet your appetite, here is Sandi&#39;s <br/>\n(Washington Home Education Network e-group) tidy summary:<br/>\n&quot;I think it is an effort to keep that ever-expanding definition of <br/>\npublic schooling from assimilating homeschooling as a form of <br/>\neducation in which parents &#39;take direct responsibility by choosing a <br/>\ncurriculum, an approach to learning, and the principles and values on <br/>\nwhich these are based.&#39;&quot;<br/>\nWriting this newsletter convinces me that such assimilation is <br/>\npossible, and that the opportunity for my children to independently <br/>\nhomeschool their own children is indeed at risk.  Perhaps that risk <br/>\nwill not play out today or tomorrow, but the squeeze on independent <br/>\nhomeschooling seems inevitable.  The Resolution is but one vision, <br/>\none first step. I promise to share more of my thinking on this issue <br/>\nlater.<br/>\nToday though, as I prepared this report, I read each news story with <br/>\nrenewed attention -the essence of the Resolution burning in the back <br/>\nof my mind. Many of these news stories point to amazing homeschooling <br/>\nsuccess, while other stories point squarely to the risk of <br/>\nassimilation.  These stories speak louder than any argument, pro or <br/>\ncon.  I wonder: would any of these stories be in the news today if <br/>\nthousands of homeschooling parents before us had not stood tall for <br/>\nindependent homeschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo read the rest of this NewsComm issue, click here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/whts_nw.html\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/whts_nw.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHEM News & Commentary is a weekly report on what&#39;s happening in the <br/>\nworld of homeschooling.
