If he is a <br/>\nDFS <br/>\ninvestigator, I would make a formal complaint that this person didn&#39;t <br/>\nID himself <br/>\nAND scared your daughter. <br/>\nDon&#39;t let them roll over on you. You have the right to know if there is <br/>\na <br/>\ncomplaint about you, not who complained but if there is one.<br/>\n*******<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would be my suggestion also - because if it isn&#39;t DFS, then you REALLY could have a problem.  There are a lot of sick wackos out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
