That&#39;s not a good enough place to stop on a<br/>\ndiscussion list!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;What people take *away* from the list and *do* is up to them. People are<br/>\nfree to read all the arguments about not controlling our children&#39;s values,<br/>\nparticipate in the debate, and yet still decide to control at home.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Here on this list we discuss and examine what *really* happens in real<br/>\nunschooling families. *Real* data that&#39;s applicable to unschooling families<br/>\nfor people to ponder and turn over to make decisions for their families.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew when I approved the first batch of Leonor&#39;s posts that they were <br/>\ninflammatory and would not in themselves help anyone to unschool.  I trusted that <br/>\nthe responses to her, though, WOULD shed light on some of the depth of trust <br/>\nthat unschoolers have for human nature in general and their own children in <br/>\nparticular.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone dropped off the list yesterday (which has 1518 members this morning) <br/>\nbecause she came to learn more about how to unschool, not for people to <br/>\ndiscuss their politics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think considerations of how to treat our children are primarily <br/>\npolitical.  There can be an aspect of that.  Conservative Christians make similar <br/>\ndecisions about childrearing sometimes.   But we&#39;re not discussing the ultimate <br/>\noutcome as much here as we are the affect various attitudes and behaviors <br/>\nhave on helping create or maintain an unschooling atmosphere.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot everyone can unschool.  Not everyone should try.  Some parents just can&#39;t <br/>\nlet go of enough control or fear to let life flow.  Some are too stiff, too <br/>\nuncompromising, too humorlous.  Not curious.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who DO want to try can be benefitted by discussions of why people have <br/>\ndecided and then sometimes changed their decisions, and how that went.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstructions on unschooling don&#39;t work very well.  (Not that we all don&#39;t <br/>\nkeep trying to write them. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat works really well is making yourself an unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92656,"nextTopicId":92655}}
