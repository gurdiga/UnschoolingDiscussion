Sort of. He&#39;s the first grandchild and great-grandchild. Because<br/>\nof his interests (fantasy/gaming/cartooning) he&#39;s sort of been written<br/>\noff by most of the family as being *creative* which isn&#39;t as valid to<br/>\nmost of them. He&#39;s also judged as being lost in his own world. But I<br/>\nthink he&#39;s created that world to have a place that felt good within<br/>\nthe world he&#39;s been stuck in. I know that I am a part of that<br/>\nworld-with the rules and regulations and judgements I carried. I have<br/>\ndropped many of them (no sugar, no tv, monitored game and computer<br/>\ntime, bed time)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What other people are immediate factors?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>truthfully? nobody. Not daily anway. It&#39;s just me and him and his<br/>\nstep-dad who is very encouraging about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; =Too many days I feel<br/>\n&gt; thwarted and put out and unheard and so afraid that I&#39;m making a huge<br/>\n&gt; mistake with him, that everyone who keeps telling me that he needs<br/>\n&gt; structure and a rigid routine or he&#39;ll get lost is right. =<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does he want more structure?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>no. he wants even less, and we have almost none.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-I keep talking to other<br/>\n&gt; unschoolers who remind me that they once felt the way that I<br/>\n&gt; feel--lost and unqualified--while completely accountable.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Completely accountable&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; If your relatives (or whoever the few judgmental people around you are) keep<br/>\n&gt; on a steady  harangue, are you accountable for the damage that does?  I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think so.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. I ruminated on that all morning. I have some very co-dependent<br/>\nissues that I&#39;ve been working on for a while. I regretted using the<br/>\nword, because I knew it would be a red flag. I&#39;m also glad I used it<br/>\nbecause the responses have been so thoughtful and have pointed me<br/>\ninward again. Never a bad thing.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=- I have this frozen inaction problem, and it was building in him. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *Maybe* (not probably, but slightly-possibly) it&#39;s a genetic thing and it<br/>\n&gt; would have built in him anyway.  Kirby procrastinates the same way I do.  The<br/>\n&gt; other kids are more like their dad in that.   I went to school and Kirby never<br/>\n&gt; did, so it can&#39;t have been school.  (I didn&#39;t procrastinate about school stuff<br/>\n&gt; as much, though I was a night-before paper-writer, but I was never a<br/>\n&gt; three-days-later paper writer.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, yes. His father and I are both procrastinators in the extreme. I<br/>\nguess I&#39;ve never thought of it as a genetic possibility, that it was a<br/>\nlearned behavior or habit. Hmmm. Well, I&#39;m still trying to be more<br/>\norganized and responsible in my life, maybe that will rub off...maybe<br/>\nit won&#39;t. The big thing I suppose is for me to let go of needing it to<br/>\nbe one way or the other. Right?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=I have years and<br/>\n&gt; years of training to break through-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of training to do things?<br/>\n&gt; What training, and trained by whom?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, well...training to wait and be quiet and be told what to do next<br/>\nby whoever is in authority...training to have low expectations for<br/>\nmyself and from the world...training to underachieve.<br/>\n<br/>\nDang. That made me sound like such a loser. I&#39;m not really as bad as<br/>\nall that. I&#39;m actually a lot better than I was a decade ago. I&#39;m even<br/>\na lot better than I was a month ago! I could stand to focus on the<br/>\npositive a little more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-I&#39;ve realized this week that part of my anger is jealousy. What an<br/>\n&gt; ugly thing to see inside of myself. To know that I feel envious of my<br/>\n&gt; son&#39;s opportunity -=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I used to see the jealousy in my husband.  I had been through a lot of Adult<br/>\n&gt; Children (of Alcoholics, in my case, but other Adult Children programs and<br/>\n&gt; co-dependency groups will help in the same way) meetings and activities and<br/>\n&gt; readings and discussions and self-examination by the time homeschooling was a<br/>\n&gt; possibility and a factor here, and that helped EXTREMELY.  I had already examined<br/>\n&gt; the whats and why&#39;s of my childhood, and imagined better options, and forgiven<br/>\n&gt; my mom quite a bit, and resolved to use that as a way to make decisions with<br/>\n&gt; my own kids.   One of the biggest resolutions in all that was not to have a<br/>\n&gt; kneejerk &quot;NO&quot; when answering children&#39;s questions.  If &quot;Yes&quot; is a possibility,&quot;<br/>\n&gt; why slam a &quot;NO&quot; in a child&#39;s face?   And because a lot of that &quot;yes&quot; led to<br/>\n&gt; some of the sweetest moments in my life to date, I was reinforced in the idea<br/>\n&gt; that being a generous and gentle mom was good for the children and good for the<br/>\n&gt; peace and joy of the family, but it was also good for the mom.   When I was<br/>\n&gt; generous and gentle, it made me a more generous and gentle person, right then and<br/>\n&gt; there.    I had the right and ability (and even experience) to be a &quot;NO WAY&quot;<br/>\n&gt; person, or &quot;Don&#39;t even think about it&quot; mom.  But that would have made me harsh<br/>\n&gt; and harder right on the spot.   It would have wounded my children&#39;s souls and<br/>\n&gt; selves every single time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay. Yes. I can work with a statement like *Yes is a possibility*.<br/>\nThat is extremely helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m amazed that after a solid 15 years of working on myself and<br/>\nletting go of the disappointment and unhappiness of my childhood, that<br/>\nso many of these old things have risen up again. I should know better.<br/>\nI know that our Self is like an onion with many layers of the same<br/>\nthing. When we peel away a layer, we get to experience the sweetness<br/>\nand freshness of that newfound freedom from the old outer layer, but<br/>\neventually the new layer will need to be peeled away...and so on.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-it&#39;s a light at the end of this tunnel we&#39;re travelling in for<br/>\n&gt; right now.

A<br/>\n&gt; tunnel sounds scary and dangerous and of a fixed length.   Maybe you can come up<br/>\n&gt; with some reflectors or flashlights at least. &lt;bwg&gt;  I&#39;m serious, though.  If<br/>\n&gt; you make an image, you can make a friendlier, airier, lighter, safer image.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe you can be in a forest with limited visibility and no direct sunlight but<br/>\n&gt; you KNOW the light is up there because the trees are alive and you KNOW it<br/>\n&gt; needs to rain sometimes, but that&#39;s okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. Thank you. This too, is very helpful. I do understand the power<br/>\nof affirmation and visualizing.

How had my mom been?  Drunk?  Self-involved and jealous herself<br/>\n&gt; of my opportunities?  Resentful of being stuck with me?  And I would imagine<br/>\n&gt; what she might have done just a LITTLE big better in that moment.  And gradually<br/>\n&gt; I would imagine what it might have been like if she had been wiser and more<br/>\n&gt; generous and less wounded herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Another very useful activity.

You can support and create space for kids to grow and learn. You can&#39;t &quot;make<br/>\n&gt; them&quot; learn, you can&#39;t &quot;force them&quot; to become a certain kind of person.

None of these had to do with ensuring his future success as an adult...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Love.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unschooling has given me more space to love my kids.

When I was <br/>\ngenerous and gentle, it made me a more generous and gentle person, right then and <br/>\nthere.

That could be a really painful feeling.  <br/>\n(For me when I&#39;m touchy and angry there is often pain hidden underneath <br/>\nthat I&#39;m trying to ignore.)<br/>\n<br/>\n**I have this frozen inaction problem, and it was building in him.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI know what you mean.  My husband was telling me that he was warning his <br/>\nstudents about this feeling of &quot;learned helplessness&quot;.  He gave them the <br/>\nexample that an elephant that is &quot;trained&quot; on a heavy chain when young <br/>\ncan be controlled with a very light rope when older because it has <br/>\ncompletely given up pulling against it.<br/>\n<br/>\n** So I&#39;ll work on that again today, on turning the envy into gratitude.**<br/>\n<br/>\nGratitude is SUCH a positive force.  I just wanted to warn you that your <br/>\nson is probably not mature enough at this stage to express gratitude, at <br/>\nleast not with any consistency.  So he may not be at the same place you <br/>\nare emotionally.  (Although I&#39;d guess he may sometimes get swamped by <br/>\nthe same sense of fear that rises up to attack you.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: getting over fears","postDate":"1098105667","msgId":100676,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNsMGcwMytmZmF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk0NjFhMjAzMDQxMDE4MDQ0MTk0OWUzNjBAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":100674,"nextInTopic":100677,"prevInTime":100675,"nextInTime":100677,"topicId":100574,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kelly, good for you!

I&#39;m impressed with your introspection and honesty. Good things are <br/>\nright ahead... and here now!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest is 17 and I have similar anxieties at times. He is working at Starbucks, plays <br/>\nMagic, the Gathering and War Hammer, and sees friends. He spends time online and <br/>\nwatches movies. He reads. He acts.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he isn&#39;t &quot;preparing for college&quot; and he isn&#39;t clear on what he wants to do next year. <br/>\nThere are days when I feel so great about his being home and other days I hope we&#39;ve <br/>\nmade the right choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I hear that voice inside, I remind myself that the other choice was so much worse <br/>\nand that&#39;s why we are here today. And I look at him. He&#39;s happier each day.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my biggest encouragement I wanted to give you is to let go of feeling ***sooo*** <br/>\nresponsible. You can support and create space for kids to grow and learn. You can&#39;t &quot;make <br/>\nthem&quot; learn, you can&#39;t &quot;force them&quot; to become a certain kind of person. In short, you aren&#39;t <br/>\n&quot;responsible.&quot; You are behaving in a responsible way, however, when you honor who your <br/>\nchild is first.<br/>\n<br/>\nA wise friend and counselor once told me &quot;The only thing you can give your kids is your <br/>\nlove.&quot; This comment came in the context of my feeling I had damaged my kids when I left <br/>\nthe Christian faith as we had understood it. I worried that I wasn&#39;t passing on what they <br/>\nneeded for their futures. I worried that I wasn&#39;t &quot;giving&quot; them enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis comment that the only thing we can give is our love stopped me cold. I was at the time <br/>\nan overachieving homeschooler. Love. Love - I could do that. I could speak nicely, I could <br/>\npitch in, I could listen to his detailed explanations of how to play a game I don&#39;t like or <br/>\nunderstand, I could watch a movie and talk about it afterwards, I could show interest, I <br/>\ncould fold his laundry when it finished before he noticed, I could buy him a hamburger <br/>\nwhen we go out... None of these had to do with ensuring his future success as an adult...<br/>\n<br/>\nLove.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling has given me more space to love my kids.

I&#39;m deeply<br/>\nafraid. I don&#39;t tell anyone we&#39;re unschooling. I&#39;m terrified of the<br/>\nanger that runs in me--anger at myself, my past, a few judgemental<br/>\npeople around us, Tyler who is becoming a teenager. I&#39;m shaking in my<br/>\nshoes because of the fight that is so often between the two of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a lot of deschooling to do as he spent 6 yrs in the system. I<br/>\nread the posts on this list and am always encouraged to continue to<br/>\nlook into my own past, to look at my habits, to work on changing them<br/>\nwith healthier, more respectful ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there&#39;s a sneer in my voice too often. Too many times I have to go<br/>\nback and apologize and try to say it another way. Too many days I feel<br/>\nthwarted and put out and unheard and so afraid that I&#39;m making a huge<br/>\nmistake with him, that everyone who keeps telling me that he needs<br/>\nstructure and a rigid routine or he&#39;ll get lost is right. That my<br/>\ninstincts to protect his creative spirit is off-base and taking him<br/>\nout of school is going to ruin his chances of any kind of a productive<br/>\nfuture.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I keep coming back to this list, and I keep talking to other<br/>\nunschoolers who remind me that they once felt the way that I<br/>\nfeel--lost and unqualified--while completely accountable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve realized this week that part of my anger is jealousy. What an<br/>\nugly thing to see inside of myself. To know that I feel envious of my<br/>\nson&#39;s opportunity to pull out of a system that was teaching him to be<br/>\na static person--the system that taught me the same thing. I have this<br/>\nfrozen inaction problem, and it was building in him. I have years and<br/>\nyears of training to break through and he might actually have a chance<br/>\nto find his voice and his song.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ll work on that again today, on turning the envy into gratitude.<br/>\nGratitude for the chance to help clear the way as much as I can.<br/>\nGratitude for the daily lessons that parenting brings me, with this<br/>\nwhole new layer of unschooling that has been mining some very old<br/>\nstuff out of me, bringing it all to the surface.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m definitely not laughing yet, but I am appreciating the joy and<br/>\nwhimsy I hear from so many people who are living the unschooling<br/>\nlife-it&#39;s a light at the end of this tunnel we&#39;re travelling in for<br/>\nright now. Ocassionally that light reflects off of some small moment<br/>\nin our day and we know that we can be part of it too.
