Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to<br/>\n&gt;17&quot; by 23&quot;),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,<br/>\n&gt;and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level<br/>\n&gt;surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned<br/>\n&gt;singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending<br/>\n&gt;upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).<br/>\n&gt;The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is<br/>\n&gt;outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less<br/>\n&gt;demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to<br/>\n&gt;delicate pages and bindings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A new mailing list &quot;gut-tv@...&quot; has been added.<br/>\n&gt;This mailing list is intended for those interested in helping or<br/>\n&gt;monitoring the progress of a public access cable TV show &quot;Free<br/>\n&gt;eBooks This Week&quot; which highlights the free eBooks posted in the<br/>\n&gt;past week.

The evolving standard economically<br/>\n&gt;and unambiguously encodes all notes, rhythms, articulations, and<br/>\n&gt;expression commonly used in classic period music. It also enables<br/>\n&gt;the extraction of a basic MIDI performance automatically. Extensive<br/>\n&gt;details about MusicXML and its adoption are available from<br/>\n&gt;http://www.recordare.com/xml.html.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As with the main project, any Public Domain works are fair game for Music,<br/>\n&gt;but we are specifically trying to complete the Beethoven String Quartets as<br/>\n&gt;a first major series too. If you&#39;d be interested in a unique outlet for your<br/>\n&gt;love of music (and perhaps dormant expertise ?), please contact Geof Pawlicki<br/>\n&gt;(gpawlicki@...) or check out the volunteer pages at<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music for further information.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for your interest !<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Personal Request:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am looking for a keyboard for my Visor Edge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The only one I am SURE will work is the:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;PA810U Targus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;but there may be others.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have tried to order many times, nothing ever arrived.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for any assistance you can provide!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Michael<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We Have Included Quick and Easy Ways to Donate. . .As Per Your Requests!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We Are Looking For Volunteers To Add eBooks In More Languages,<br/>\n&gt;and in more formats, including music, artwork, movies, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;QUICK WAYS TO MAKE A DONATION TO PROJECT GUTENBERG<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A.

She was born in a prosperous family which<br/>\n&gt;later fell on hard times. Her family lived in various towns in Victoria<br/>\n&gt;during her childhood and youth and she attended Presbyterian Ladies<br/>\n&gt;College between the ages of 13 and 17.

W.J. &quot;Billy&quot; Tauzin (R-La.) and John<br/>\n&gt;Dingell (D-Mich.) would force broadcasters to stop sending analog TV<br/>\n&gt;signals by the end of 2006, rendering most TVs obsolete by 2007. The<br/>\n&gt;Tauzin-Dingall draft, which Congressional staffers hastened to call a<br/>\n&gt;&quot;starting point,&quot; sparked a firestorm of protest from broadcasters and<br/>\n&gt;consumer groups. The move is aimed at stepping up the pace of the<br/>\n&gt;switchover from analog to digital TV that was legislated back in 1996.<br/>\n&gt;Under current law, TV stations may continue using airwaves earmarked for<br/>\n&gt;analog signals until 85% of U.S. households in their markets own digital TV<br/>\n&gt;sets, but sales have been extremely slow, hampered by high prices and<br/>\n&gt;limited digital programming. The proposed legislation also requires the FCC<br/>\n&gt;to settle a dispute between the entertainment industry and technology firms<br/>\n&gt;over how best to implement copy-protection technology, known as a broadcast<br/>\n&gt;flag, designed to prevent digital over-the-air TV shows from being copied<br/>\n&gt;and redistributed via the Internet. A hearing is set for next week.

The webcasters have argued that the rates are too high<br/>\n&gt;for a new medium and are planning to appeal the rate of 0.07 cent per song<br/>\n&gt;per listener, which was set last June by the Librarian of Congress. The<br/>\n&gt;music companies are also appealing the rates, which they say are too low.<br/>\n&gt;The two groups are engaged in discussions in an effort to head off dueling<br/>\n&gt;lawsuits, but so far the talks have not produced a settlement. Some<br/>\n&gt;Internet radio firms and broadcasters have already shut down their<br/>\n&gt;webcasting operations, at least in part because of the upcoming royalty<br/>\n&gt;payment. &quot;It was purely an economic decision,&quot; says the CEO of<br/>\n&gt;Jefferson-Pilot Corp.&#39;s radio operations, which has stopped streaming 15 of<br/>\n&gt;its 17 stations online because of the fees.

The bill<br/>\n&gt;was proposed by Assemblyman Tim Leslie. Davis said he supported the<br/>\n&gt;measure because he wanted to prevent an explosion of spam to mobile<br/>\n&gt;devices similar to what has happened with personal computers. The<br/>\n&gt;mobile phone spam bill will go into effect in January. Davis also<br/>\n&gt;signed into law two other privacy bills, one that places stricter<br/>\n&gt;limits on junk faxes and another to facilitate the creation of a<br/>\n&gt;statewide &quot;do not call&quot; list.<br/>\n&gt;ZDNet, 20 September 2002<br/>\n&gt;http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1105-958789.html<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;TAUZIN PROPOSES DEADLINE FOR DIGITAL TV<br/>\n&gt;Billy Tauzin (R-La.) has proposed requiring television broadcasters to<br/>\n&gt;switch completely to digital signal transmissions by early 2006 and end<br/>\n&gt;analog transmissions by the end of that year. Members of the television<br/>\n&gt;industry, including broadcasters and makers of electronic equipment,<br/>\n&gt;have been slow to agree on a plan to make the transition to digital<br/>\n&gt;signals, and Tauzin thinks it&#39;s time for regulators to step in. He<br/>\n&gt;said, &quot;While we prefer marketplace solutions, clearly it&#39;s time for us<br/>\n&gt;to provide leadership in this area.&quot; Under Tauzin&#39;s proposal, the<br/>\n&gt;Federal Communications Commission would establish technical standards<br/>\n&gt;with which broadcasters and equipment makers would have to comply. At<br/>\n&gt;least one consumer group criticized the proposal as too heavy-handed,<br/>\n&gt;stifling innovation and fair use. A spokesman for Tauzin said it was<br/>\n&gt;not clear yet if or when the proposal would be offered as a bill.<br/>\n&gt;New York Times, 19 September 2002 (registration req&#39;d)<br/>\n&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/technology/tech-media-digitaltv.html<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;NO COMPROMISE ON DVD STANDARD<br/>\n&gt;Two industry groups supporting conflicting standards for rewritable<br/>\n&gt;DVDs have apparently given up on resolving their differences and<br/>\n&gt;settling on a single standard. The DVD+RW Alliance and the DVD Forum<br/>\n&gt;support different formats, and there are at least four types of discs,<br/>\n&gt;causing headaches for consumers and device manufacturers. The result is<br/>\n&gt;an alphabet soup of formats and media that consumers must keep<br/>\n&gt;straight: DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM, DVD+RW, DVD+R. Observers note that<br/>\n&gt;the market for rewritable DVDs depends largely on resolving the<br/>\n&gt;conflicting standards, making the discs and the formats fully<br/>\n&gt;compatible on PCs as well as home and portable DVD devices. Sony<br/>\n&gt;reportedly will release new drives that work with different formats,<br/>\n&gt;but pressure from companies including Intel may eventually push the two<br/>\n&gt;DVD organizations to find a compromise.<br/>\n&gt;CNET, 18 September 2002<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;BREAKING THE SPEED OF LIGHT, ON A BUDGET<br/>\n&gt;Researchers at Middle Tennessee State University have created a device<br/>\n&gt;that can send electric signals at four times the speed of light, and<br/>\n&gt;they did so with commonly available components costing $500. This is<br/>\n&gt;not the first time electric signals have exceeded the speed of light,<br/>\n&gt;but it is the first time it&#39;s been done without extremely expensive<br/>\n&gt;equipment. The device, which one researcher was able to assemble from<br/>\n&gt;parts in just 40 minutes, can create a pulse of energy that, measured<br/>\n&gt;by an oscilloscope, moves at 4 billion kilometers per hour. Bill<br/>\n&gt;Robertson, one of the researchers, hopes that students and other<br/>\n&gt;researchers can use the device to cheaply test some of the basic<br/>\n&gt;theories of modern science.<br/>\n&gt;New Scientist, 16 September 2002<br/>\n&gt;http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992796<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You have been reading excerpts from Edupage:<br/>\n&gt;If you have questions or comments about Edupage,<br/>\n&gt;http://news.com.com/2100-1040-958352.html<br/>\n&gt;or send e-mail to: edupage@...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To SUBSCRIBE to Edupage, send a message to<br/>\n&gt;LISTSERV@...<br/>\n&gt;and in the body of the message type:<br/>\n&gt;SUBSCRIBE Edupage YourFirstName YourLastName<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;About the Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter:<br/>\n&gt;[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.
