I know that <br/>\nyou aren&#39;t telling me to do so, but I would like to know how that <br/>\nworked for your family.  I thought by laying the gifts out and <br/>\nletting the kids decide to open them or not was giving them the <br/>\ntruest form of freedom and respect.  But as you read I am torn b/c I <br/>\ncan foresee 2 very let down children on xmas morning when that tree <br/>\nhas only 1-2 gifts maybe instead of 10-15 or however many I can <br/>\nafford.<br/>\n*************<br/>\nWhat if you let the kids know that it&#39;s important to YOU that you get to <br/>\nshare the opening on Christmas? It&#39;s a ritual, and ritual is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing: maybe they just like unwrapping gifts. Instead of putting <br/>\nall the stuff out ahead of time, what if you got lots of small Advent gifts <br/>\n(candy, little toys, fun socks), wrapped them, and had one opened each day until <br/>\nChristmas? We use an Advent calendar with chocolate. That&#39;s fun. Once we got a <br/>\ncool (but expensive) Playmobile advent calendar...that was VERY cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other way out of this....they want you to put things out as they&#39;re <br/>\nwrapped. So don&#39;t wrap them until the last minute, or, as Sandra said, wrap and put <br/>\nout boring stuff first. Instead focus on other Christmasy stuff, then <br/>\nfuriously wrap at the last minute.<br/>\n<br/>\nLOL Because he wasn&#39;t in school, Julian was free to believe in Santa until <br/>\nthe last minute...so he did until he was 12, at least officially. <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85385,"nextTopicId":85419}}
