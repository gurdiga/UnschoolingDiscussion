(they won&#39;t tell you that, of course ;)  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your state requires any kind of yearly testing, it may be <br/>\nadvantageous to have your child tested for dyslexia, especially if <br/>\nthe state provides accomodations. There was a report just issued (in <br/>\nJanuary, if I remember correctly) that showed dyslexic students who <br/>\nwere provided accomodations for testing scored a whopping 40% higher <br/>\non the tests than the group of students who were given no <br/>\naccomodations. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as whether or not your child will feel &quot;labeled&quot; with a <br/>\ndiagnosis is for you to decide. My son was *very* aware that he saw <br/>\nthings and learned things different from all of his friends. We <br/>\ndecided to be very open with him, and he says that he feels better <br/>\nabout himself now. He said that before, when he knew he was different <br/>\nbut didn&#39;t know why, he thought something was &quot;wrong&quot; with him. Now <br/>\nhe understands that he sees things differently than his friends do, <br/>\nand vice versa. It also helped him to know that he has quite a few <br/>\nfamily members who are dyslexic, and there are more than a few famous <br/>\npeople who are. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re interested, you can go to www.BrightSolutions.US which is a <br/>\nwonderful website on dyslexia. It has lots of information, which is <br/>\nespecially helpful for those who think that dyslexia is limited to <br/>\nletter reversal (it&#39;s not). They can also give you a list of <br/>\ncertified dyslexia testers in your area, and they have several free <br/>\nvideos on dyslexia that you can get.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, word retrieval difficulty is called dysnomia, and it is a common <br/>\ntrait of dyslexics. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Carri Ann~<br/>\nmom to Star Wars/lego obsessed 10 y/o</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164542605,"authorName":"Danielle Conger","from":"&quot;Danielle Conger&quot; &lt;danielle.conger@...&gt;","profile":"danielleconger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] conference question","postDate":"1079727926","msgId":92048,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDEwMWM0MGRmMCQ1MGM2NmQzMCQ5MjAxYThjMEBqZ2s2OTAwPg==","referencesHeader":"PDM2LjUzN2FiNDgwLjJkOGNhOWZmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":92045,"nextInTopic":112322,"prevInTime":92047,"nextInTime":92049,"topicId":8756,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So, that *sure* puts it in perspective!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were just in Boston in December, and I would *highly* recommend seeing<br/>\nsome of the sights in the area if you can. We really loved our time at<br/>\nPlimoth Plantation and the Children&#39;s Museum--those alone are worth the<br/>\ntime. The Freedom Trail was okay--the Revere house was not really worth the<br/>\nwalk thru, imo. We also did the Salem Witch Museum, and that was pretty<br/>\nlame, though just walking around their gift shop and open museum (not the<br/>\nactual show) was worth a stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve already registered just for me, and I&#39;m *really* looking forward to it.<br/>\nI still don&#39;t know if the family will be coming or not, but they&#39;d be<br/>\nhanging by the pool if they did. That saved us the big family<br/>\nregistration--kids are little (6, 5 and 3) and dh is NOT interested.<br/>\n(rolling my eyes here at dh!) I&#39;m trying to talk one of my local unschoolers<br/>\ninto accompanying me. If she does, then we&#39;ll probably just go by ourselves<br/>\nand split the hotel room.
