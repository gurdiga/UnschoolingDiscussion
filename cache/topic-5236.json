Some of the more well known ones include in Splash Mountain, <br/>\nthere&#39;s one part that if you look up at the clouds, they&#39;re shaped like <br/>\nMickey.  In Great Movie Ride (Disney-MGM Studios), in the gangster scene, <br/>\nyou look up at the top windows of one of the warehouse buildings, and there&#39;s <br/>\na silhouette of Mickey&#39;s head. It&#39;s a lot of fun, especially for those of us <br/>\nwho have been to Disney a million times...  I printed them out and put them in<br/>\na binder that we bring with us sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s great for honing their observation skills, and we all get so excited<br/>\nwhen we find a new one!<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great day!<br/>\nRobin<br/>\nOrlando, FL<br/>\n :-)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5229,"nextTopicId":5159}}
