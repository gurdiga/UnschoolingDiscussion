I&#39;m really glad for their  <br/>\nability and presence, because they can channel some of what&#39;s being  <br/>\nwritten in English into the radical parenting community in France.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvie has posted on this list in times past, and looks like this:  <br/>\nSylvie Martin/<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eliott2@...\">eliott2@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSylvie has written an article on her journey from snobbishly  <br/>\ndisallowing TV and taking pride in the fact that her family didn&#39;t  <br/>\nwatch it, to trying things because of discussions on this list (!)  <br/>\nand describes what she learns all in one place, and elegantly.     <br/>\nI&#39;ve asked her to translate it into English, and she&#39;s working on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is something from our e-mail exchange yesterday, and she&#39;s given  <br/>\nme permission to just post it directly:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-When I will have time, I will write a mail for the unschooling  <br/>\nlists, to say how wonderful is our life with unschooling. Our  <br/>\nchildren are so... I can&#39;t find a word to explain... I remember when  <br/>\nI wrote on &quot;Always learning&quot; about tv, and about Tom who will watch  <br/>\nit all the day, with no end if I let him do it.. And some of you told  <br/>\nme &quot;How do you know ? Did you try ?&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Yes, now, we tried, and it&#39;s so wonderful, how my children seem to  <br/>\nfeel &quot;free&quot;... I&#39;m not judging anymore, I&#39;m not scared anymore ...  <br/>\nIt&#39;s because of you.. I beggan to trust what you said, you, Sandre,  <br/>\nand lot of women on those lists, I think I felt inside it was &quot;true&quot;,  <br/>\nbut I could&#39;nt really believe it.. And trusting you made me trusting  <br/>\nmy children. A trust I didn&#39;t have before, or it was well hidden :-))-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n=========================<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said she&#39;s getting grief from some of the other parents there who  <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to consider that TV limits are unnecessary.  They don&#39;t  <br/>\nlike that she&#39;s described that as controlling.   (Sounds familiar,  <br/>\nright?)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of you read French or know people who read French who could  <br/>\nbenefit from knowing their site is there, and easy address to  <br/>\nremember is<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/french\">http://sandradodd.com/french</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you get in there, the links lead to other links.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother of the moms writing there is Jeanine Barb√©, who wrote (this  <br/>\nmorning, and their site address is included in that):<br/>\n==============<br/>\nSandra dear,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very confused, I don&#39;t remember whether I sent you an email or not,<br/>\nto tell you that I&#39;ve translated &quot;moving a puddle&quot; and &quot;balancing in the<br/>\nmiddle ground&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been talking with Sylvie about... an article on<br/>\nunschoolingdiscussion...and It just hit in my head!! Did I sent an email<br/>\nto Sandra?? Did I??
