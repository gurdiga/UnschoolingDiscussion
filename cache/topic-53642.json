The den doesn&#39;t have <br/>\nan outside wall.  On the north side a bedroom (now my office) was built in <br/>\n(of what used to be a big 70&#39;s rec-room), and on the south there&#39;s a big <br/>\nwindow in the original outside wall, but it opens into a large enclosed <br/>\nformer patio/porch thing.   To the east, wall with fireplace (dirt and garage <br/>\non the other side), and to the west, bathroom and wall (and hallway to Marty, <br/>\nwashing machine and sewing room.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is PERFECT for me.  NO direct sunlight, EVER.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see the outside north or south, but I don&#39;t have to GO there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the kitchen I don&#39;t have curtains.  A big window has a climbing viney <br/>\nthing growing over it (I&#39;m growing a curtain) on the black netting for <br/>\nkeeping birds out of fruit trees.   In the smaller window over the sink, <br/>\nthere&#39;s a crystal we got as a wedding gift.  It makes rainbows.   For a while <br/>\neach day, there are rainbows projected on the shadow of the vine from the <br/>\nother window.  It&#39;s awesome, two window-shows in the same place.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53659,"nextTopicId":53437}}
