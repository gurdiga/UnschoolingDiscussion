I quit my job, and moved closer to <br/>\nfamily primarily so i could HS, and also to help my sister with my <br/>\ndisabled mother. We are fortunate enough that my mother can afford to <br/>\npay for caregivers, and that she is willing to pay *us* (my sister <br/>\nand me)to do the job. This week was my first week, it was actually <br/>\npretty nice being there with my mom after four years living in <br/>\nanother state. My son and I share a 2 bd apartment with my brother, <br/>\nwhich means my expenses are fairly low, but we don&#39;t have alot of <br/>\nspace. For the past two years we&#39;ve had a terrific woman come from <br/>\nLithiunia from Sept until March to take care of my mom (she&#39;s <br/>\nbecome like extended family now), if we invite her back in sept. i <br/>\nwon&#39;t have a job so will have to come up with other plans until the <br/>\nfollowing March. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf my son&#39;s father wouldve just agreed to work evenings (like he had <br/>\nthe entire time i&#39;d known him, up until it was actually beneficial <br/>\nfor him to!grrrrr...)i couldve kept my job in Ohio, and we couldve <br/>\nswung HSing there. But our lives here are much better, so much more <br/>\nfree time, more relaxed, not so many bills to fret over. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say the number one benefit to being a single mom HS&#39;er is that i <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to convince a dh that unschooling is the best way, or deal <br/>\nwith any of the husband issues i often read about (&quot;my dh thinks we <br/>\narent doing enough school&quot; or &quot;my dh keeps quizzing the kids!&quot;)...and <br/>\nluckily since my son&#39;s father and i are so far on terrific terms i <br/>\nhavent had to worry about him dragging me into court to challenge <br/>\nHSing.
