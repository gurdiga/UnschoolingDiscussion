But, we<br/>\n&gt; still had to go through the preliminary workup: the  home study, meeting<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; the lawyer, etc...In our neck of the woods, we had to wait 1 yr before<br/>\n&gt; finalizing the adoption, even though our son was with us from day 1.  He<br/>\ndid<br/>\n&gt; not have to go to foster care or anything like that, but instead, came<br/>\nhome<br/>\n&gt; from the hospital with us, which was beyond great!  After a year, we went<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; the juvenile court, and became finalized and permanently legalized<br/>\nadoptive<br/>\n&gt; parents!  Then we had a reception!  It was a great event!  Best of luck to<br/>\n&gt; you!  I know you must be SO excited!!!
