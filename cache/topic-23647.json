I am very surprised at<br/>\nthe comments you made regarding the unschoolers in your local group. I<br/>\nwould consider myself a radical unschooler, always have been, and think<br/>\nthat I know all if not most of the unschoolers in the Riverside group and<br/>\na couple in the Rancho group (I think there are only a couple in that group).<br/>\nI am very surprised that anyone would tell<br/>\nyou not to expose your children to the elderly or anything else for that <br/>\nmatter.  Are you sure the persons you were talking to were unschoolers?<br/>\nIt just doesn&#39;t mesh with my experience with the members of our group.<br/>\nYou should have just asked me ; )<br/>\nThe only thing I could imagine someone saying would be that if your<br/>\nchildren are already heavily involved in other activities it might not be<br/>\nthe time to add something else into the mix. Anyhow just trying to figure<br/>\nout what you have been told or what the context was. Seems very<br/>\nstrange to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23845,"nextTopicId":23842}}
