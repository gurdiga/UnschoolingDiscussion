One <br/>\nquestion-- <br/>\n what about when they share a room and argue about its cleanliness (one messy <br/>\n one neat!) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNever had to face it.  We always had 3 bedrooms.  One for each of the older <br/>\nones.  The younger ones still in our room.  Then, by the time they were old <br/>\nenough for their own rooms the older ones were gone.  Blessings of a large <br/>\nage gap between children I suppose.  But, then again I&#39;ve never had to <br/>\ncontend with a neat kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I have to say the trick is not to get upset.  When we finally padlocked <br/>\na room it was with the very calm comment that &quot;it&#39;s a fire hazard, you&#39;re <br/>\nrisking every life in this family and it&#39;s no longer acceptable, this is the <br/>\nend of the discussion.  You need something out of that room or, wish to go in <br/>\nthere to clean it, go through the window.  However, you will not be allowed <br/>\nto sleep in there or relax in there until it&#39;s cleaned.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I have to say it had become a serious fire hazard.  People often comment <br/>\nthat stuff was laying knee deep somewhere when it&#39;s not that bad.  This was <br/>\nbeyond knee deep.  At one point I went in there and found newspapers at the <br/>\nbottom of the pile from the previous year.  Not to mention I kept hearing how <br/>\nthey had nothing to wear, which of course translated to &quot;I can&#39;t find <br/>\nanything to wear in that mess.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not a screamer, yeller, spanker or any of that.  But, I have my limits.  <br/>\nI tolerate a lot more mess in my house than I like.  Simply because everyone <br/>\nhas different standards.  At the ripe age of 43 I finally decided if it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t bother anyone else why do I care.  In reality, I do care and my <br/>\nfamily has come to realize my stop point.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow with just the three little ones at home I find myself starting over on <br/>\nthe pick up your stuff department. One of the things that seems to work here <br/>\nis for me to say at around 8 pm once or twice a week, look I have to have <br/>\nthis stuff done, it&#39;s driving me nuts.  And the old adage if mom ain&#39;t happy <br/>\nno one is happy seems to sink in.  So if everyone will just start picking up <br/>\nfor half an hour, I&#39;ll call us even and everyone can go about their business. <br/>\n At 8:30 I yell out it&#39;s 8:30 thank you everyone, and I ignore the rest.  DH <br/>\nis the BEST in this situation, he&#39;ll keep the little ones moving while I work <br/>\nin the kitchen...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the best situation for my standards, but for now it works.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTeens are a whole other thing.  I&#39;ve never *assigned* chores.  I probably <br/>\nshould but I always hated to have to do them.  So I ask for help.  Normally, <br/>\nthey will help out with things simply because when young I instilled the <br/>\n&quot;look I don&#39;t ask very often&quot; psychology.  But, I do have the standing rule <br/>\nthat your room is yours, the living room, kitchen etc is everyone&#39;s.  Do what <br/>\nyou want in there, but don&#39;t drag it into the common household areas.  If you <br/>\ndo, then you&#39;re old enough to pick up after yourselves.  If they don&#39;t and I <br/>\nhave to ask several times to get their stuff up, I just throw it out the <br/>\nfront door.  And, I don&#39;t discriminate.  The 22 yo son I have lost a walkman <br/>\nCD player to the rain.  He was madder than a hornet.  Well you bought it mom, <br/>\nyou just lost xxx dollars.  I didn&#39;t lose anything, I gave you the gift, you <br/>\ndidn&#39;t care for it, you obviously didn&#39;t care, I tossed it out, I&#39;m not <br/>\nreplacing it.  Now, that&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t first try to *not go on the out <br/>\nthe door stuff* when there is expensive stuff laying around.  Usually, I hope <br/>\nthey&#39;ll get it up first.  The 22 yo to this day doesn&#39;t know that he had left <br/>\nthe cd player laying around and the 2 yo had broken it beyond repair before <br/>\nit went out the door &lt;eg&gt;.  My oldest will tell you that his biggest fear was <br/>\nthat he&#39;d be let off by the school bus at the front of the house and his <br/>\nunderwear would be flapping from the porch post.  It&#39;s a real cure.  But, <br/>\nit&#39;s extreme...  So before you do something like this, warning is a very good <br/>\nthing.  I mean saying *look I&#39;ve asked and asked, so any thing else I find <br/>\nafter 8 am tomorrow is outta here I have floors that have to be done*  I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t just casually, daily walk around and do it...  I let them know it was <br/>\ncoming first.  After the first time, it was rare that it happened again.  Be <br/>\naware that the dh tolerates it too.  His only *assigned* task in the <br/>\nhousehold is garbage.  He doesn&#39;t take it out, I don&#39;t go in the kitchen or, <br/>\nI just pick up the trash can and throw it lock stock and barrel out the back <br/>\ndoor.  I don&#39;t want to smell that all day.  Usually, this happens when the <br/>\nthing is full and overflowing too, it&#39;s not as if he doesn&#39;t KNOW it needs to <br/>\ngo out.  DH NEVER leaves his stuff laying around though.  He&#39;s afraid he&#39;ll <br/>\nmiss the warning and something he has to have (he&#39;s the pack rat here) will <br/>\nbe gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe won&#39;t go into the period when the teens turn into college, I&#39;m home once <br/>\nevery few weekends, kids.  They think they are guests at that point.  I&#39;m <br/>\nstill working on that one.  The 21 yo had to blow dry her money last week <br/>\ncause I just picked up and threw her shorts into the washer without checking.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlotte</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;Tracy@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"-966-gQN3w8eR9nLQ4swDfvU9Fe2TDrFeS1VuJG8TcDKzu4mtQ2Tygh8y_5fsc5zWn7yuz03tmTRBYrl0cevNlNtH57mA2PFoEOqqU7RVd4bz36DPL1KaiAn","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Going on strike","postDate":"938122538","msgId":3238,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMjIuMzIzOC45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3236,"nextInTopic":3241,"prevInTime":3237,"nextInTime":3239,"topicId":3159,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Stick to your guns Girl!!!

The problem is some men never notice how much work we really do around the house and the family. What is even worse they do not mind the mess (your sink full of dishes being a grand example of that).
