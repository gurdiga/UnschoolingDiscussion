I think legalizing","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1585666829\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;From: &quot;Myranda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:myrandab@...\">myrandab@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;OK, I have to say that I strongly disagree with marijuana being made <br/>\n&gt;illegal! I don&#39;t think it should ever have been classified as a drug at <br/>\n&gt;all. It is one thing that has numerous uses, is not harmful when smoked in <br/>\n&gt;moderation, and is very healing for some things, including pain relief.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;But - lol another but - although I never did any kind of drugs myself, my <br/>\n&gt;teenage years were spent being friends with, having boyfriends, and even <br/>\n&gt;living with drug sellers in south Georgia. I know for a fact that they will <br/>\n&gt;actively recruit users by getting young people started with the &quot;mild&quot; <br/>\n&gt;drugs (pot being a favorite), and then a few weeks to a month later, saying <br/>\n&gt;they have something a little better, and getting them onto that. And so on <br/>\n&gt;and so on til you&#39;re looking at a kid with a serious crack or heroin <br/>\n&gt;addiction, and doing mushrooms or some other hallucinogenic on top of that. <br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s a money-maker to them. The deeper they can get a kid in, the more <br/>\n&gt;seriously addictive drugs they can get them on, the more money they can <br/>\n&gt;make. My boyfriend&#39;s step-father told me one day that one kid will on <br/>\n&gt;average make him over $500 a month, easily. Take 10-15 kids buying from him <br/>\n&gt;at any given time, and you&#39;ve got a sizable, steady income that they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt;willing to fight tooth and nail to hang on to.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Guess what Myranda??? Are you sitting down?? I agree with you!!! No buts or <br/>\nanything, at least so far. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with the first part. I think legalizing and using hemp for a cash <br/>\ncrop is a great idea. There are a lot of uses for it and it&#39;s friendly to <br/>\nthe earth. (and whoever smokes it!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also agree with the second part too. Drugs of any kind are a big money <br/>\nmaker and the more potent the drug gets, the more money to be made off of <br/>\nit. I think it&#39;s easier to try and get a kid already smoking weed to try <br/>\nsomething else becuse they know that kid is already open to the idea of <br/>\ntrying something new or &quot;bad&quot; for you. And yet again, I agree with the <br/>\nthought someone else had saying that either you are the kind of person who <br/>\nwill do or not. I know plenty of people who only tried pot and didn&#39;t like <br/>\nit, still smoke it and nothing else and those who have &quot;gone on to other <br/>\nthings.&quot; I think the ones who go on to other things would have done so <br/>\nwhether someone was there to encourage them or not. Maybe not so soon, but <br/>\neventually anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just like being unfaithful. My mom always said if you accuse someone of <br/>\nit long enough, they will go out and do it. I think you are either the kind <br/>\nof person who will or won&#39;t. Accusations aren&#39;t necessary. You either get to <br/>\napoint where you try to get away with it to have you cake and eat it too or <br/>\njust don&#39;t care anymore. I just don&#39;t see where blaming &quot;makes&quot; someone go <br/>\nout and do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSurf the Web without missing calls!

When I was a kid faced with tough choices, I did not have my mom and <br/>\ndad to turn to - ever - and I regret this now.  I can see with my excellent <br/>\nhindsight that I could have had a much easier time of it and maybe avoided <br/>\nsome hardships if I could have had the benefit of their expertise.  It&#39;s <br/>\ngood for me to remember this, though, because I am reminded to be conscious <br/>\nabout accepting Liam for who he is, not who I want him to be.   I&#39;m a <br/>\npacifist, but Liam likes to play fighting games.  He and I are different <br/>\npeople, but I accept him, and I learn from him because we are different.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think my folks were ever able to go there.<br/>\n<br/>\n~marji~<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

That&#39;s not to say that I didn&#39;t enjoy smoking grass<br/>\n&gt; or dropping acid, because I really did!  It was fun.  It eventually became<br/>\n&gt; more fun for me being straight.  Oddly enough, I never got in trouble for<br/>\n&gt; taking drugs!  (I sure did get in a heap of trouble over other stuff, like<br/>\n&gt; skipping school, ferinstance.)  I never ever liked alcohol (I could never<br/>\n&gt; get it past my nose).  Same with coffee.  I did enjoy smoking cigarettes,<br/>\n&gt; too, but I felt it was messing up my voice and that freaked me out enough<br/>\n&gt; to quit &quot;cold turkey&quot; when I was 18.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hey, my mother quit smoking cold turkey about a year and a half ago - at the<br/>\nage of 85!

In my opinion, that&#39;s a lot propaganda<br/>\n&gt; and hooey to scare people away from marijuana, which was William Randolph<br/>\n&gt; Hearst&#39;s big issue.

It was a<br/>\n&gt; renewable resource.  And, it was fairly cheap!  But WRH was invested<br/>\n&gt; heavily in deforestation to produce paper.  So, if he was going to be<br/>\n&gt; successful in that endeavor, hemp would have to be made illegal.  He began<br/>\n&gt; an enormous propaganda campaign to the end.  Anyone who is interested can<br/>\n&gt; google &quot;hemp,&quot; &quot;hearst,&quot; and &quot;propaganda,&quot; and you&#39;ll find plenty more<br/>\n&gt; information about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not just Hearst.  Think alcohol and tobacco companies.  And it was easy to<br/>\npull off at that time because the vast majority of pot smokers were black or<br/>\nChicano people.  Pretty marginalized, especially at that time.  I&#39;d like to<br/>\nhave seen them try to make it illegal in the late 60s or early 70s or now,<br/>\nfor that matter.

Although, I know I heard it lots of <br/>\ntimes growing up and since then, too, but in my own experience and in <br/>\nknowing many, many people who have used or still use drugs, I have rarely <br/>\n(if ever) seen that &quot;stepping stone&quot; thing that the drug &quot;experts&quot; warned <br/>\nus about.  I think it&#39;s like almost everything else.  People who are gonna <br/>\ndo drugs are gonna do drugs.  People who are not gonna do drugs are not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly did my share of using drugs as a kid and when I got to be about <br/>\n18 or 19 years old I realized that I liked myself better for the most part <br/>\nwhen I was straight.   That&#39;s not to say that I didn&#39;t enjoy smoking grass <br/>\nor dropping acid, because I really did!  It was fun.  It eventually became <br/>\nmore fun for me being straight.  Oddly enough, I never got in trouble for <br/>\ntaking drugs!  (I sure did get in a heap of trouble over other stuff, like <br/>\nskipping school, ferinstance.)  I never ever liked alcohol (I could never <br/>\nget it past my nose).  Same with coffee.  I did enjoy smoking cigarettes, <br/>\ntoo, but I felt it was messing up my voice and that freaked me out enough <br/>\nto quit &quot;cold turkey&quot; when I was 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve known loads of folks who have smoked pot and drank and did all kinds <br/>\nof drugs but either stopped or still smoke pot to this day and never went <br/>\non to stronger or addictive drugs.  In my opinion, that&#39;s a lot propaganda <br/>\nand hooey to scare people away from marijuana, which was William Randolph <br/>\nHearst&#39;s big issue.  That&#39;s because, as I understand it, hemp used to be <br/>\nthe crop used to make paper.  And, it was a sensible crop to use because it <br/>\nwas quickly and easily regrown and left forests standing whole.  It was a <br/>\nrenewable resource.  And, it was fairly cheap!  But WRH was invested <br/>\nheavily in deforestation to produce paper.  So, if he was going to be <br/>\nsuccessful in that endeavor, hemp would have to be made illegal.  He began <br/>\nan enormous propaganda campaign to the end.  Anyone who is interested can <br/>\ngoogle &quot;hemp,&quot; &quot;hearst,&quot; and &quot;propaganda,&quot; and you&#39;ll find plenty more <br/>\ninformation about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, when I have that &quot;talk&quot; with Liam about drugs, I&#39;m going to tell <br/>\nhim the truth!  That&#39;s what he deserves!<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I wanted to last night, but I was so tired my eyes were crossing.<br/>\nDalene,  I can totally understand what you are saying in the &#39;trust&#39; and protecting our children.  I was (and still am probably) the same way but I&#39;m slowly learning a new way of thinking.  And it has been just kind of slowing make its may into my brain.  It shows up in all parts of our lives.   Like I&#39;ve said before,  I grew up with my parents &#39;protecting&#39; me.  In my case my parents really were uneducated.  They did the best they could do and they believed that &#39;good&#39; parents did those things. For example: Informed me that I had to go to bed at this exact time,  I had to: brush my hair, teeth, wear the right clothes, go to church every Sunday, act this and that way, and really never allowed me to feel my feelings.  Never said, &quot;gee, you are feeling depressed or sad, sure you can have a day just to figure out how you are feeling&quot;.  Which maybe that would have enabled me to get through things and then I would have chosen to do those things.<br/>\nI know that this is my case (and sorry its so long) and this probably isn&#39;t your case but I think what people are saying that if we are honest, caring and patient with our children they will then grow to be caring, responsible people.  They&#39;ll know that drugs hurt their bodies, they&#39;ll know that if they don&#39;t go to bed they&#39;ll be tired,  they&#39;ll figure out if they have too much caffeine they&#39;ll sleep lousy and maybe not feel good the next day.  This is what is happening with my 9 yr old right now.  And he is figuring it out marvelously,  the soccer game they went to, first he wanted to save a pop for the game and then he thought he&#39;d drink one on the way home in the car too.  I was just kind-of going OK,  I&#39;m not going to say &quot;you can&#39;t do that&quot;  so I said, &quot; you know what, if you drink that Mountain Dew Code Red in the car at 9:00 you might have a really hard time falling asleep when you do want to sleep and you might not feel so good.  But its up to you.&quot;    Well,  he opted to have a Sprite, which I know still has sugar.  But he is figuring it out.  He didn&#39;t have a soda until he was maybe 4 years old because I never offered it to him,  well,  with the other kids they&#39;ve been around it more because Alec is there.  One daughter never has a pop, the other sometimes does, but its not a big deal.   When I was first a parent, my view was, no pop, no TV, no Nintendo.  Very extreme.  So I&#39;ve really changed my views.<br/>\nAs far as drugs,  I&#39;m hoping I will instill in them the self-worth that they want to take care of their bodies and can recognize if something is bad for them.  My son can&#39;t believe that people even want to take drugs,  he can&#39;t figure it out.  Which I know he is young, but I believe if we as parents instill in them positive self-esteems and educate them on the benefits of eating right and taking care of ourselves, they&#39;ll do the right thing.  <br/>\nWe can&#39;t control what other people do, such as peer pressures and we can&#39;t control what people put on TV or in the theaters or in books, but what we can control is how be act about those things and then our children will eventually learn how to make the right decisions.<br/>\nI hope this helps,  I really don&#39;t mean to be harsh or aggressive.  And it probably was too long.  But I really want you to know that I know where you are coming from.<br/>\nMy best,<br/>\nKelli<br/>\n <br/>\n Stephanie Elms &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stephanie.elms@...\">stephanie.elms@...</a>&gt; wrote:&gt; Thanks for all your replies, I do enjoy discussing this and I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; do have a lot to digest. I  feel quite comfortable with most <br/>\n&gt; of the ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Take your time! There is no rush. I know that I am still processing<br/>\nand I have been reading here for several months now. And it is <br/>\njust recently that I have taken the plunge....<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read any of the posts at unschooling.com? Before I took the <br/>\nplunge I searched the archives for tv limits and food limits and read<br/>\neverything I could find. I found my fears were eased the more I read <br/>\nabout real parents who let their real kids have more control and how <br/>\nthese real kids handled this control. I find that I keep having these<br/>\n&quot;aha!&quot; moments. I also have always had conflicting feelings about making<br/>\nfood decisions (exactly how much does my son have to eat before he can<br/>\nget a desert etc). I hated that I started not enjoying making cookies with<br/>\nJason because I hated the arguments we would get into later. I always <br/>\nwondered if I was just a wimpy parent and Jason sensed my weakness because<br/>\nhe always pushed for more. We are still in the adjustment phase (only been<br/>\n2 weeks (and I have to admit I am still trying to give up complete control!)<br/>\nbut it has not been as bad as I thought. Definitely eating more &quot;junk&quot; food,<br/>\nbut still eating the good stuff too. And they have not gone completely <br/>\noverboard. We have less arguments which is nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing with tv. I used to feel guilty if I let them have a &quot;tv&quot; day. Like<br/>\nI was not a good parent to have to resort to using the tv. But I have started<br/>\nwatching with them and really seeing why they are enjoying what they are <br/>\nenjoying. Today was a major tv day. We just got back from the weekend at my ILs.<br/>\nStayed up late, lots of attention from the grandparents. Lots of neat stuff (my<br/>\nILs took them to the Marine Museum in Va Beach, they had a blast). Pretty long<br/>\ncar ride. I actually understand why Jason only wanted to veg today. I actually<br/>\njoined him for part of it. The other part of the day was spent playing with<br/>\nmy 2 yo. Jason would join us for a little while then go back to tv. And there<br/>\nwere a couple of times when he turned it off to concentrate on his bionicles <br/>\n(legos). We will see how tomorrow goes, but I expect that we will probably<br/>\nnot overdose on tv again. Once again, reducing limits has helped me enjoy<br/>\nthe boys more...no arguments over turning it off, fun cuddling on the couch.<br/>\nFun enjoying the boys enjoying themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I do however find some of the responses (not <br/>\n&gt; only to me) on this group harsh, judgmental and aggressive. <br/>\n&gt; I do not understand this, since I would think people that so <br/>\n&gt; strongly believe in this style of parenting would be far more <br/>\n&gt; helpful to help other people in transition (like myself) to <br/>\n&gt; understand what unschooling is about. I imagine some people <br/>\n&gt; might be turned off by individual aggressive replies rather <br/>\n&gt; than the philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that anyone is being purposefully harsh. But I agree that no<br/>\none is going to hold your hand here. I do not take anything anyone posts <br/>\npersonally (at least I haven&#39;t yet!) and honestly have learned a lot from<br/>\nthe blunt posts. I have not always agreed with them, but they have made me<br/>\nlook at things from a different perspective. I first joined this list when<br/>\nthere was a brouhaha (sp??) about what unschooling was and was not. A lot<br/>\nof bickering back and forth about how people were being mean and too <br/>\njudgmental. A splinter group broke off to start a &quot;more gentle&quot; <br/>\nunschooling list. I joined for a little while, but soon unsubbed because<br/>\nI was not getting anything from it. Not sure if it was  because everyone<br/>\nwas being too nice or because I was looking for someone to challenge my<br/>\nbeliefs. The folks here are very good at debating ideas and calling you<br/>\non things, asking you to really think about why you do things. If you<br/>\ncan avoid taking things personally you can gain some interesting insights.<br/>\nAt least I know that I have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can relate to Stephanie Elm&#39;s posts and a few others, <br/>\n&gt; because I think they might not be that far ahead of me in <br/>\n&gt; this process and they have an understanding for where I am <br/>\n&gt; coming from. I am too regarded as way to relaxed by my <br/>\n&gt; friends, and here it is quite opposite. It certainly does <br/>\n&gt; challenge my belief system.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This has been the hardest thing for me. It seems like almost everything<br/>\nthat I have thought about being a &quot;good&quot; parent is being challenged.<br/>\nFor me that has been a good thing...there are many things that I accepted<br/>\nthat I must do as a good parent that I have not been comfortable with (tv and <br/>\nfood restrictions etc). It is almost a relief for me. I find that I am enjoying<br/>\nthe boys more now that I do not feel the need to enforce restrictions. I feel<br/>\ncloser to them and I do not see any major backlashes yet. I still have issues<br/>\nthat I am working on (will have to post on them later) but for the most part,<br/>\nthe changes we have made lately have been for the good.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as limits go, someone suggested that I might not trust <br/>\n&gt; my children. I don&#39;t believe that this is a matter about <br/>\n&gt; trust. I believe it is about understanding my role as parent. <br/>\n&gt; I have always felt that my role is to love them, guide them <br/>\n&gt; and protect them. Within the unschooling approach I <br/>\n&gt; understand that I have to love them and guide them, but don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; protect them. I&#39;m not quite at ease with that. If feel that I <br/>\n&gt; might not be fulfilling my responsibility if I don&#39;t protect <br/>\n&gt; the and to protect them means to sometimes keep them away.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ohh! Ouch. Now who is being harsh! ;o) But I think that I understand<br/>\nwhere you are coming from. Protecting is equated with restrictions.<br/>\nSo if there are no restrictions, there is no protection.  But I do <br/>\nnot feel that I am harming them by loosening up on restrictions. In<br/>\nfact I hope that I am giving them a gift by helping them get to know<br/>\nand trust themselves. I am not throwing up my arms and saying that <br/>\nyou are on your own. I am not turning the tv on and watching CSI<br/>\nwith my 5 yo. Or going out and buying only junk food to have around<br/>\nthe house. I would never do anything that I thought was damaging <br/>\nto my boys. What I am hearing here is that people who have done<br/>\nthis (given more control to their kids) have had success. I love <br/>\nreading about the older kids (PamS, Sandra and the others). The<br/>\nrelationship they have with their parents is really what is helping<br/>\nconvince me. I see teenagers who are comfortable talking with their<br/>\nparents, who value their parents opinions, who take responsibility,<br/>\nand make good judgment calls. After all the horror stories that I<br/>\nhave heard from friends and on tv about living with teenagers, this<br/>\nsays to me that these folks are on to something. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think our limits are mostly in three areas - bedtimes, <br/>\n&gt; food, and TV. Bedtimes I can see the other side, food is <br/>\n&gt; mostly about not limitless sweets which is both a budget and <br/>\n&gt; health concern and can&#39;t really see us change that, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Search unschooling.com for food limits...there are several posts that deal<br/>\nwith exactly these issues. What convinced me is that the people who<br/>\npost that they give control over food to their kids also tell how<br/>\ntheir kids do make good choices, do find a balance (even though they may<br/>\nbinge when first given control). What I have found so far is that the<br/>\nbiggest difference so far is that I do not say no when they want a candy<br/>\nbar at the store. So far the .50 candy bar has not broken the bank. Jason<br/>\ndid ask for a bag of smarties last week. I think he forgot it was there, but<br/>\ndid ask for it today. He and Kyle ate quite a few (but I fully expected them<br/>\nto eat the whole bag and there is still 3/4 of it left). We are only 2 weeks<br/>\nin, so we are still in adjustment phase. But honestly it has not changed my<br/>\npurchasing too much. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but TV is <br/>\n&gt; still a sticky one for me. I hear what you all say about <br/>\n&gt; research and that is an interesting outlook - someone said <br/>\n&gt; that their five year old commented on a TV programme that <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re just having noisy sex. My five year old don&#39;t know <br/>\n&gt; what sex is, and all honestly I don&#39;t want him to know about <br/>\n&gt; it just yet. Sure he is bound to ask more questions soon, but <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll wait patiently. I can see that it might be okay to watch <br/>\n&gt; the news with Dad, but I still don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be watching <br/>\n&gt; Nine-and-a-half weeks while he is in the room. Someone asked <br/>\n&gt; about TV usage in our house. It is very limited. I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; watch much at all and my husband watches some in the evening. <br/>\n&gt; The TV aren&#39;t on unless we watch.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here again I can only comment on our experience (doing the no tv<br/>\nlimits for about 4 weeks now). No limits does not mean that we<br/>\nare watching everything and anything with him around. I don&#39;t <br/>\nsuggest that we watch things that I do not think are appropriate<br/>\nfor him. If he expresses an interest in something that I am <br/>\nreally opposed to, I will have to see how I will handle it. But so<br/>\nfar he has not asked to view anything terrible. Today he did ask<br/>\nto watch Civil War Journal (I tape these and watch them after<br/>\nhe goes to bed because they do have some battle re-enactments that<br/>\nI thought might be too much for him.) I told him that there might<br/>\nbe some scary or sad parts (talked a bit about war). He decided that<br/>\nit would be ok and he handled it fine. Plus we had some good discussions<br/>\nfrom watching it. He has said that he did not want to watch things as well.<br/>\nJason loves the crocodile hunter so he wanted to see the movie when it <br/>\ncame out. We watched the promos for it together and *he* decided that it<br/>\nwas too violent and did not want to be scared.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far Jason has only asked to watch shows on the history channel, a&e, tlc<br/>\nand animal planet. He has seen sitcoms like friends or shows like ed  but <br/>\nhas no desire to watch them. Now we have tivo, which lets us tape all the <br/>\nshows we are interested in and watch them whenever we want. So he does not<br/>\nreally channel surf. We can also fast forward through commercials. Maybe <br/>\nstarting out taping the shows might make it easier to make the jump?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My experience of parenting without limits have been <br/>\n&gt; neglectful ones. Parents that don&#39;t set limits, because they <br/>\n&gt; could not be bother. And those children&#39;s behavior is not <br/>\n&gt; what I would like mine to be. Maybe that is too controlling <br/>\n&gt; too, who knows?? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ahhh. But there is a huge difference. I am not making this decision because<br/>\nI can not be bothered. This is a *very* well thought out and researched<br/>\ndecision on my part. I am also not just turning them loose with a remote<br/>\nand saying go at it with no guidance. I am also very available so they <br/>\ndo not need to turn to the tv for lack of attention. I often watch and enjoy<br/>\nwith them. It is a way of connecting, not just a way of getting them out <br/>\nof my hair. I also provide my kids with ample opportunities for other activities.<br/>\nSo to compare my kids with parents who are neglecting their children is like <br/>\ncomparing apples and oranges. And I do not think that the outcomes will be the same.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think my uneasiness with all this is that I might make the <br/>\n&gt; wrong choice for my children. I might choose to let them find <br/>\n&gt; their own limits and that might be the wrong choice for them. <br/>\n&gt; Because if we like it or not, we do make decisions for them. <br/>\n&gt; We do choose to unschool them and raise them in a particular <br/>\n&gt; way. Thinking about it, like anything else, one needs to <br/>\n&gt; truly believe in it, before you would be able to let go of <br/>\n&gt; all the limits. I am clearly not there, but willing to learn more.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup. I worry too. But do we ever really know if we are making the right decisions<br/>\nfor our kids? We do the best we can. All I know is that this makes sense to me.<br/>\nIn my gut. The more I read the more it feels right. I have learned when they <br/>\nwere little to follow my instinct and it has not led me wrong yet. Keep reading.<br/>\nThe  important thing is that it sounds like you have an open mind. Let it sink in<br/>\nfor awhile. And if it continues to make sense (and it must make sense to you on <br/>\nsome level or you would not be willing to learn more!) you can make the jump <br/>\nanytime.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read a thread recently at unschooling.com that had lots of &quot;aha&quot; moments for <br/>\nme. Of course it might not have the same effect for you, but you might want<br/>\nto give it a shot:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/401/6535.html?FridaySeptember620020237am\">http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/401/6535.html?FridaySeptember620020237am</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A hypothetical question comes to mind. What would you all do <br/>\n&gt; if your young teenager experiences with serious drugs?? I can <br/>\n&gt; not imagine giving them all the information and sit back and <br/>\n&gt; wait for them to make the right choice?? Off course it would <br/>\n&gt; be near impossible to coerce them into giving it up, but I do <br/>\n&gt; think I will try.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hypotheticals are hard to discuss. Having a 5 yo, it is hard for <br/>\nme to flash forward to his teenage years. :o) Too many variables<br/>\nthat I do not know. Maybe someone with older kids has some more<br/>\ninsight...but from what I have read, those folks with older kids<br/>\nhave not really run into this problem. I would guess that given <br/>\nthe opportunity to make decisions and have control over their <br/>\nlives would give them less reasons to turn to drugs. They would<br/>\nbe more open to listening to their parents and drugs would not<br/>\nhave the forbidden fruit appeal. But this is all supposition since<br/>\nit is all hypothetical.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thanks for discussing this with me, especially those of you <br/>\n&gt; that do it in patience and understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Anytime...it has been helpful for me as well as I am still working<br/>\nout a lot of things in my mind as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yahoo!

There is a tremendous drug market, and not just for illegal drugs, <br/>\n  either! (A whole other topic, right?)  I guess what I mean to say is that a <br/>\n  person who has a strong sense of self will have an easier time navigating <br/>\n  those choppy waters.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Hmmm maybe that&#39;s a reason I was never tempted to even try anything. I always feared the lack of control, that I wouldn&#39;t be &quot;me&quot;, if that makes any sense. Although I drink sometimes, I&#39;ve never drank to the point of getting drunk, either, for the same reason. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I grew up right outside of NYC, and if someone wanted to buy drugs you <br/>\n  could drive right down the street and get _anything_ you wanted as though <br/>\n  it were the MacDonalds drive-through.  But, I never met a drug recruiter, <br/>\n  if you will, and by that I mean someone who tried to coax me into taking <br/>\n  anything.  So, I&#39;m reporting on my experience and the experience of the <br/>\n  people I was surrounded by.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** I&#39;ve heard that about the big cities. In smaller cities, though, the sellers are much more careful and picky about who they sell to. I guess they have to be, there&#39;s just not too many ways they can fade into the background if the law comes sniffing around in a small-town atmosphere. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My point, as I said earlier, was that people who are going to do drugs are <br/>\n  going to do them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** You don&#39;t think that it&#39;s possible to change minds by educating them about the dangers? I know some won&#39;t care, but surely it would get thru to some others? <br/>\n<br/>\n    I believe that people who have a strong sense of self <br/>\n  will be able to stop doing drugs if that&#39;s what they want to do.  It <br/>\n  appears to me that addictions occur in people who have a serious need for <br/>\n  some kind of escape (all kinds of addictions, drugs and alcohol being only <br/>\n  two of the many).  These are the folks who can fall prey to drug <br/>\n  pushers.  And, I believe they would fall prey whether they were already <br/>\n  smoking pot or had never smoked a thing in their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** I definitely agree!!! If someone is happy and secure with who they are, they would have no need to rely on escapes such as addictions to drugs, drink, or gambling. Experiment with, sure, but not to the point of being addicted to. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think that kids have a better shot at succeeding here if we show them we <br/>\n  trust them enough to be truthful with them, not just to scare them.  I <br/>\n  think that your experience is a valuable one to share with your kids (when <br/>\n  they&#39;re ready to grasp it) because you can be truthful with them about it; <br/>\n  it was your experience.  My talk with Liam will be different than yours <br/>\n  because he deserves the truth from me, and my truth was not the same as <br/>\n  yours.  Of course, part of what he will hear will be that drug pushers and <br/>\n  marketers of all stripes (legal and illegal) are profiteers.  He&#39;ll need to <br/>\n  know how to follow his instincts and sift out the truth as best he can and <br/>\n  know the best course for him to go.  Hopefully, he won&#39;t have much need for <br/>\n  escape, and if he does experiment with drugs, he&#39;ll be able to stay strong <br/>\n  and be in touch with himself.  Hopefully, he and I will have open enough <br/>\n  communications and trust between us so that he will be able to seek out my <br/>\n  counsel if he is not sure which way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** OK, question here for everyone. Did you talk to your parents when you had concerns about drugs, sex, drink, etc? What was it about them and/or the way they treated you that made you feel comfortable doing so or not doing so?<br/>\n<br/>\n  My mom always talked to me about everything, and I talked to her about other everyday things, but I never felt comfortable talking to her about stuff like this, so I never did. It liked to have killed me to tell her I was pregnant the first time, and I was married! My dad, well, he was never really around much, always working or parked in front of a TV, so I never talked to him or he to me about anything at all. I want my children to feel comfortable enough to talk to me about anything, and they do now, thank goodness, but I don&#39;t know how the teenage years will change that. Will the boys only feel comfortable talking to Dad? Anything in particular I can do so they feel equally comfortable with me? Just things I&#39;ve been wondering about for awhile!!<br/>\n  Myranda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think that all this needs to be in the mix when we&#39;re talking about kids <br/>\n  avoiding addictions and all the other kinds of trouble kids can get into.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Love,<br/>\n  Marji<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I don&#39;t think it should ever have been classified as a drug at all. It is one thing that has numerous uses, is not harmful when smoked in moderation, and is very healing for some things, including pain relief. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut - lol another but - although I never did any kind of drugs myself, my teenage years were spent being friends with, having boyfriends, and even living with drug sellers in south Georgia. I know for a fact that they will actively recruit users by getting young people started with the &quot;mild&quot; drugs (pot being a favorite), and then a few weeks to a month later, saying they have something a little better, and getting them onto that. And so on and so on til you&#39;re looking at a kid with a serious crack or heroin addiction, and doing mushrooms or some other hallucinogenic on top of that. It&#39;s a money-maker to them. The deeper they can get a kid in, the more seriously addictive drugs they can get them on, the more money they can make. My boyfriend&#39;s step-father told me one day that one kid will on average make him over $500 a month, easily. Take 10-15 kids buying from him at any given time, and you&#39;ve got a sizable, steady income that they&#39;re willing to fight tooth and nail to hang on to. <br/>\n<br/>\nI learned a lot of things the couple years I spent with one family (anyone need a car stolen? LOL), but that one lesson has stuck with me the longest and best. I know that a lot of kids get drugs at school or through a friend and will go no further, but there are plenty of people out there actively looking to get kids deeply addicted, and they&#39;d love nothing better than to find one already on the &quot;mild&quot; stuff. It&#39;s a dangerous world out there when you get too deep into it. Several of my old friends are now dead, including the boyfriend&#39;s stepfather who was shot by an addict who broke in to steal some drugs since he didn&#39;t have the money to buy them. The addict was a boy that I&#39;d gone to church with, had helped us build the church, and had worked beside me in the sound/light room during special events. So sad, he&#39;s still in jail and will be for quite a while. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, maybe I&#39;m biased from my experiences, but I just can&#39;t downplay the effect of drugs. They damage, they hurt, they kill. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi, Myranda!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can&#39;t say that I agree with that!  Although, I know I heard it lots of <br/>\n  times growing up and since then, too, but in my own experience and in <br/>\n  knowing many, many people who have used or still use drugs, I have rarely <br/>\n  (if ever) seen that &quot;stepping stone&quot; thing that the drug &quot;experts&quot; warned <br/>\n  us about.  I think it&#39;s like almost everything else.  People who are gonna <br/>\n  do drugs are gonna do drugs.  People who are not gonna do drugs are not.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I certainly did my share of using drugs as a kid and when I got to be about <br/>\n  18 or 19 years old I realized that I liked myself better for the most part <br/>\n  when I was straight.   That&#39;s not to say that I didn&#39;t enjoy smoking grass <br/>\n  or dropping acid, because I really did!  It was fun.  It eventually became <br/>\n  more fun for me being straight.  Oddly enough, I never got in trouble for <br/>\n  taking drugs!  (I sure did get in a heap of trouble over other stuff, like <br/>\n  skipping school, ferinstance.)  I never ever liked alcohol (I could never <br/>\n  get it past my nose).  Same with coffee.  I did enjoy smoking cigarettes, <br/>\n  too, but I felt it was messing up my voice and that freaked me out enough <br/>\n  to quit &quot;cold turkey&quot; when I was 18.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve known loads of folks who have smoked pot and drank and did all kinds <br/>\n  of drugs but either stopped or still smoke pot to this day and never went <br/>\n  on to stronger or addictive drugs.  In my opinion, that&#39;s a lot propaganda <br/>\n  and hooey to scare people away from marijuana, which was William Randolph <br/>\n  Hearst&#39;s big issue.  That&#39;s because, as I understand it, hemp used to be <br/>\n  the crop used to make paper.  And, it was a sensible crop to use because it <br/>\n  was quickly and easily regrown and left forests standing whole.  It was a <br/>\n  renewable resource.  And, it was fairly cheap!  But WRH was invested <br/>\n  heavily in deforestation to produce paper.  So, if he was going to be <br/>\n  successful in that endeavor, hemp would have to be made illegal.  He began <br/>\n  an enormous propaganda campaign to the end.  Anyone who is interested can <br/>\n  google &quot;hemp,&quot; &quot;hearst,&quot; and &quot;propaganda,&quot; and you&#39;ll find plenty more <br/>\n  information about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, when I have that &quot;talk&quot; with Liam about drugs, I&#39;m going to tell <br/>\n  him the truth!

I think it&#39;s like almost everything else.  People who are gonna <br/>\ndo drugs are gonna do drugs.  People who are not gonna do drugs are not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly did my share of using drugs as a kid and when I got to be about <br/>\n18 or 19 years old I realized that I liked myself better for the most part <br/>\nwhen I was straight.   That&#39;s not to say that I didn&#39;t enjoy smoking grass <br/>\nor dropping acid, because I really did!  It was fun.  It eventually became <br/>\nmore fun for me being straight.  Oddly enough, I never got in trouble for <br/>\ntaking drugs!  (I sure did get in a heap of trouble over other stuff, like <br/>\nskipping school, ferinstance.)  I never ever liked alcohol (I could never <br/>\nget it past my nose).  Same with coffee.  I did enjoy smoking cigarettes, <br/>\ntoo, but I felt it was messing up my voice and that freaked me out enough <br/>\nto quit &quot;cold turkey&quot; when I was 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve known loads of folks who have smoked pot and drank and did all kinds <br/>\nof drugs but either stopped or still smoke pot to this day and never went <br/>\non to stronger or addictive drugs.  In my opinion, that&#39;s a lot propaganda <br/>\nand hooey to scare people away from marijuana, which was William Randolph <br/>\nHearst&#39;s big issue.  That&#39;s because, as I understand it, hemp used to be <br/>\nthe crop used to make paper.  And, it was a sensible crop to use because it <br/>\nwas quickly and easily regrown and left forests standing whole.  It was a <br/>\nrenewable resource.  And, it was fairly cheap!  But WRH was invested <br/>\nheavily in deforestation to produce paper.  So, if he was going to be <br/>\nsuccessful in that endeavor, hemp would have to be made illegal.  He began <br/>\nan enormous propaganda campaign to the end.  Anyone who is interested can <br/>\ngoogle &quot;hemp,&quot; &quot;hearst,&quot; and &quot;propaganda,&quot; and you&#39;ll find plenty more <br/>\ninformation about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, when I have that &quot;talk&quot; with Liam about drugs, I&#39;m going to tell <br/>\nhim the truth!

I know that I am still processing<br/>\nand I have been reading here for several months now. And it is <br/>\njust recently that I have taken the plunge....<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read any of the posts at unschooling.com? Before I took the <br/>\nplunge I searched the archives for tv limits and food limits and read<br/>\neverything I could find. I found my fears were eased the more I read <br/>\nabout real parents who let their real kids have more control and how <br/>\nthese real kids handled this control. I find that I keep having these<br/>\n&quot;aha!&quot; moments. I also have always had conflicting feelings about making<br/>\nfood decisions (exactly how much does my son have to eat before he can<br/>\nget a desert etc). I hated that I started not enjoying making cookies with<br/>\nJason because I hated the arguments we would get into later. I always <br/>\nwondered if I was just a wimpy parent and Jason sensed my weakness because<br/>\nhe always pushed for more. We are still in the adjustment phase (only been<br/>\n2 weeks (and I have to admit I am still trying to give up complete control!)<br/>\nbut it has not been as bad as I thought. Definitely eating more &quot;junk&quot; food,<br/>\nbut still eating the good stuff too. And they have not gone completely <br/>\noverboard. We have less arguments which is nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing with tv. I used to feel guilty if I let them have a &quot;tv&quot; day. Like<br/>\nI was not a good parent to have to resort to using the tv. But I have started<br/>\nwatching with them and really seeing why they are enjoying what they are <br/>\nenjoying. Today was a major tv day. We just got back from the weekend at my ILs.<br/>\nStayed up late, lots of attention from the grandparents. Lots of neat stuff (my<br/>\nILs took them to the Marine Museum in Va Beach, they had a blast). Pretty long<br/>\ncar ride. I actually understand why Jason only wanted to veg today. I actually<br/>\njoined him for part of it. The other part of the day was spent playing with<br/>\nmy 2 yo. Jason would join us for a little while then go back to tv. And there<br/>\nwere a couple of times when he turned it off to concentrate on his bionicles <br/>\n(legos). We will see how tomorrow goes, but I expect that we will probably<br/>\nnot overdose on tv again. Once again, reducing limits has helped me enjoy<br/>\nthe boys more...no arguments over turning it off, fun cuddling on the couch.<br/>\nFun enjoying the boys enjoying themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I do however find some of the responses (not <br/>\n&gt; only to me) on this group harsh, judgmental and aggressive. <br/>\n&gt; I do not understand this, since I would think people that so <br/>\n&gt; strongly believe in this style of parenting would be far more <br/>\n&gt; helpful to help other people in transition (like myself) to <br/>\n&gt; understand what unschooling is about. I imagine some people <br/>\n&gt; might be turned off by individual aggressive replies rather <br/>\n&gt; than the philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that anyone is being purposefully harsh. But I agree that no<br/>\none is going to hold your hand here. I do not take anything anyone posts <br/>\npersonally (at least I haven&#39;t yet!) and honestly have learned a lot from<br/>\nthe blunt posts. I have not always agreed with them, but they have made me<br/>\nlook at things from a different perspective. I first joined this list when<br/>\nthere was a brouhaha (sp??) about what unschooling was and was not. A lot<br/>\nof bickering back and forth about how people were being mean and too <br/>\njudgmental. A splinter group broke off to start a &quot;more gentle&quot; <br/>\nunschooling list. I joined for a little while, but soon unsubbed because<br/>\nI was not getting anything from it. Not sure if it was  because everyone<br/>\nwas being too nice or because I was looking for someone to challenge my<br/>\nbeliefs. The folks here are very good at debating ideas and calling you<br/>\non things, asking you to really think about why you do things. If you<br/>\ncan avoid taking things personally you can gain some interesting insights.<br/>\nAt least I know that I have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can relate to Stephanie Elm&#39;s posts and a few others, <br/>\n&gt; because I think they might not be that far ahead of me in <br/>\n&gt; this process and they have an understanding for where I am <br/>\n&gt; coming from. I am too regarded as way to relaxed by my <br/>\n&gt; friends, and here it is quite opposite. It certainly does <br/>\n&gt; challenge my belief system.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This has been the hardest thing for me. It seems like almost everything<br/>\nthat I have thought about being a &quot;good&quot; parent is being challenged.<br/>\nFor me that has been a good thing...there are many things that I accepted<br/>\nthat I must do as a good parent that I have not been comfortable with (tv and <br/>\nfood restrictions etc). It is almost a relief for me. I find that I am enjoying<br/>\nthe boys more now that I do not feel the need to enforce restrictions. I feel<br/>\ncloser to them and I do not see any major backlashes yet. I still have issues<br/>\nthat I am working on (will have to post on them later) but for the most part,<br/>\nthe changes we have made lately have been for the good.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as limits go, someone suggested that I might not trust <br/>\n&gt; my children. I don&#39;t believe that this is a matter about <br/>\n&gt; trust. I believe it is about understanding my role as parent. <br/>\n&gt; I have always felt that my role is to love them, guide them <br/>\n&gt; and protect them. Within the unschooling approach I <br/>\n&gt; understand that I have to love them and guide them, but don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; protect them. I&#39;m not quite at ease with that. If feel that I <br/>\n&gt; might not be fulfilling my responsibility if I don&#39;t protect <br/>\n&gt; the and to protect them means to sometimes keep them away.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ohh! Ouch. Now who is being harsh! ;o) But I think that I understand<br/>\nwhere you are coming from. Protecting is equated with restrictions.<br/>\nSo if there are no restrictions, there is no protection.  But I do <br/>\nnot feel that I am harming them by loosening up on restrictions. In<br/>\nfact I hope that I am giving them a gift by helping them get to know<br/>\nand trust themselves. I am not throwing up my arms and saying that <br/>\nyou are on your own. I am not turning the tv on and watching CSI<br/>\nwith my 5 yo. Or going out and buying only junk food to have around<br/>\nthe house. I would never do anything that I thought was damaging <br/>\nto my boys. What I am hearing here is that people who have done<br/>\nthis (given more control to their kids) have had success. I love <br/>\nreading about the older kids (PamS, Sandra and the others). The<br/>\nrelationship they have with their parents is really what is helping<br/>\nconvince me. I see teenagers who are comfortable talking with their<br/>\nparents, who value their parents opinions, who take responsibility,<br/>\nand make good judgment calls. After all the horror stories that I<br/>\nhave heard from friends and on tv about living with teenagers, this<br/>\nsays to me that these folks are on to something. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think our limits are mostly in three areas - bedtimes, <br/>\n&gt; food, and TV. Bedtimes I can see the other side, food is <br/>\n&gt; mostly about not limitless sweets which is both a budget and <br/>\n&gt; health concern and can&#39;t really see us change that, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Search unschooling.com for food limits...there are several posts that deal<br/>\nwith exactly these issues. What convinced me is that the people who<br/>\npost that they give control over food to their kids also tell how<br/>\ntheir kids do make good choices, do find a balance (even though they may<br/>\nbinge when first given control). What I have found so far is that the<br/>\nbiggest difference so far is that I do not say no when they want a candy<br/>\nbar at the store. So far the .50 candy bar has not broken the bank. Jason<br/>\ndid ask for a bag of smarties last week. I think he forgot it was there, but<br/>\ndid ask for it today. He and Kyle ate quite a few (but I fully expected them<br/>\nto eat the whole bag and there is still 3/4 of it left). We are only 2 weeks<br/>\nin, so we are still in adjustment phase. But honestly it has not changed my<br/>\npurchasing too much. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but TV is <br/>\n&gt; still a sticky one for me. I hear what you all say about <br/>\n&gt; research and that is an interesting outlook - someone said <br/>\n&gt; that their five year old commented on a TV programme that <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re just having noisy sex. My five year old don&#39;t know <br/>\n&gt; what sex is, and all honestly I don&#39;t want him to know about <br/>\n&gt; it just yet. Sure he is bound to ask more questions soon, but <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll wait patiently. I can see that it might be okay to watch <br/>\n&gt; the news with Dad, but I still don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be watching <br/>\n&gt; Nine-and-a-half weeks while he is in the room. Someone asked <br/>\n&gt; about TV usage in our house. It is very limited. I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; watch much at all and my husband watches some in the evening. <br/>\n&gt; The TV aren&#39;t on unless we watch.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here again I can only comment on our experience (doing the no tv<br/>\nlimits for about 4 weeks now). No limits does not mean that we<br/>\nare watching everything and anything with him around. I don&#39;t <br/>\nsuggest that we watch things that I do not think are appropriate<br/>\nfor him. If he expresses an interest in something that I am <br/>\nreally opposed to, I will have to see how I will handle it. But so<br/>\nfar he has not asked to view anything terrible. Today he did ask<br/>\nto watch Civil War Journal (I tape these and watch them after<br/>\nhe goes to bed because they do have some battle re-enactments that<br/>\nI thought might be too much for him.) I told him that there might<br/>\nbe some scary or sad parts (talked a bit about war). He decided that<br/>\nit would be ok and he handled it fine. Plus we had some good discussions<br/>\nfrom watching it. He has said that he did not want to watch things as well.<br/>\nJason loves the crocodile hunter so he wanted to see the movie when it <br/>\ncame out. We watched the promos for it together and *he* decided that it<br/>\nwas too violent and did not want to be scared.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far Jason has only asked to watch shows on the history channel, a&e, tlc<br/>\nand animal planet. He has seen sitcoms like friends or shows like ed  but <br/>\nhas no desire to watch them. Now we have tivo, which lets us tape all the <br/>\nshows we are interested in and watch them whenever we want. So he does not<br/>\nreally channel surf. We can also fast forward through commercials. Maybe <br/>\nstarting out taping the shows might make it easier to make the jump?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My experience of parenting without limits have been <br/>\n&gt; neglectful ones. Parents that don&#39;t set limits, because they <br/>\n&gt; could not be bother. And those children&#39;s behavior is not <br/>\n&gt; what I would like mine to be. Maybe that is too controlling <br/>\n&gt; too, who knows?? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ahhh. But there is a huge difference. I am not making this decision because<br/>\nI can not be bothered. This is a *very* well thought out and researched<br/>\ndecision on my part. I am also not just turning them loose with a remote<br/>\nand saying go at it with no guidance. I am also very available so they <br/>\ndo not need to turn to the tv for lack of attention. I often watch and enjoy<br/>\nwith them. It is a way of connecting, not just a way of getting them out <br/>\nof my hair. I also provide my kids with ample opportunities for other activities.<br/>\nSo to compare my kids with parents who are neglecting their children is like <br/>\ncomparing apples and oranges. And I do not think that the outcomes will be the same.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think my uneasiness with all this is that I might make the <br/>\n&gt; wrong choice for my children. I might choose to let them find <br/>\n&gt; their own limits and that might be the wrong choice for them. <br/>\n&gt; Because if we like it or not, we do make decisions for them. <br/>\n&gt; We do choose to unschool them and raise them in a particular <br/>\n&gt; way. Thinking about it, like anything else, one needs to <br/>\n&gt; truly believe in it, before you would be able to let go of <br/>\n&gt; all the limits. I am clearly not there, but willing to learn more.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup. I worry too. But do we ever really know if we are making the right decisions<br/>\nfor our kids? We do the best we can. All I know is that this makes sense to me.<br/>\nIn my gut. The more I read the more it feels right. I have learned when they <br/>\nwere little to follow my instinct and it has not led me wrong yet. Keep reading.<br/>\nThe  important thing is that it sounds like you have an open mind.

It scares me that the parents of the Columbine gunmen were <br/>\nnot aware that their sons were building bombs and storing up an <br/>\narsenal in the basement.  I think freedom to choose comes in stages, <br/>\nas the children mature and are able to survive the results of their <br/>\nchoices.  So what to wear can be an early choice, while what to eat <br/>\nand smoke should be left to a little later in life.  (These are <br/>\nmidnight examples, please no flame wars.)<br/>\n<br/>\nProverbs 3:1-2 says:  My son, do not forget my teaching, but guard my <br/>\ncommands in your heart; for long life and years in plenty will they <br/>\nbring you, and prosperity as well.  (Sounds like the rewards are <br/>\nworth trying for.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, the Bible supports unschooling, with verses like <br/>\nthis:  Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old <br/>\nhe will not depart from it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been told by Biblical scholars that, in the original language <br/>\nof the Bible, this means to know your child, his strengths and <br/>\nweaknesses, her inborn talents, and then give them full support and <br/>\nfree rein to help them fulfill those qualities/qualifications.  If <br/>\nJohnny wants to be a nurse and Susie wants to be President, do all <br/>\nyou can to help them prepare.  That is &quot;the way they should go.&quot;  And <br/>\nif you try to train a child in something s/he is not suited for, they <br/>\nmay fail miserably when older and will probably depart from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read earlier today (can&#39;t find the exact verse right now) that God <br/>\ngave each of us unique skills and abilities to accomplish great and <br/>\nmighty works for him.

I  feel quite comfortable with most of the ideas. I do however find some of the responses (not only to me) on this group harsh, judgemental and aggressive. I do not understand this, since I would think people that so strongly believe in this style of parenting would be far more helpful to help other people in transition (like myself) to understand what unschooling is about. I imagine some people might be turned off by individual aggressive replies rather than the philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can relate to Stephanie Elm&#39;s posts and a few others, because I think they might not be that far ahead of me in this process and they have an understanding for where I am coming from. I am too regarded as way to relaxed by my friends, and here it is quite opposite. It certainly does challenge my belief system.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think some of you that are very comfortable within these ideas, have been there for so long and adopted it so fully, that you might have difficulty in understanding other people&#39;s fears and concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as limits go, someone suggested that I might not trust my children. I don&#39;t believe that this is a matter about trust. I believe it is about understanding my role as parent. I have always felt that my role is to love them, guide them and protect them. Within the unschooling approach I understand that I have to love them and guide them, but don&#39;t protect them. I&#39;m not quite at ease with that. If feel that I might not be fulfilling my responsibility if I don&#39;t protect the and to protect them means to sometimes keep them away.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think our limits are mostly in three areas - bedtimes, food, and TV. Bedtimes I can see the other side, food is mostly about not limitless sweets which is both a budget and health concern and can&#39;t really see us change that, but TV is still a sticky one for me. I hear what you all say about research and that is an interesting outlook - someone said that their five year old commented on a TV programme that they&#39;re just having noisy sex. My five year old don&#39;t know what sex is, and all honestly I don&#39;t want him to know about it just yet. Sure he is bound to ask more questions soon, but I&#39;ll wait patiently. I can see that it might be okay to watch the news with Dad, but I still don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be watching Nine-and-a-half weeks while he is in the room. Someone asked about TV usage in our house. It is very limited. I don&#39;t watch much at all and my husband watches some in the evening. The TV aren&#39;t on unless we watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience of parenting without limits have been neglectful ones. Parents that don&#39;t set limits, because they could not be bother. And those children&#39;s behaviour is not what I would like mine to be. Maybe that is too controlling too, who knows?? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think my uneasiness with all this is that I might make the wrong choice for my children. I might choose to let them find their own limits and that might be the wrong choice for them. Because if we like it or not, we do make decisions for them. We do choose to unschool them and raise them in a particular way. Thinking about it, like anything else, one needs to truly believe in it, before you would be able to let go of all the limits. I am clearly not there, but willing to learn more.<br/>\n<br/>\nA hypothetical question comes to mind. What would you all do if your young teenager experiences with serious drugs?? I can not imagine giving them all the information and sit back and wait for them to make the right choice??
