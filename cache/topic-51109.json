But I don&#39;t think you can<br/>\navoid having any exposure to phonics whatsover.  They&#39;re all over the place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t teach my son phonics so he could read.  He would ask about the<br/>\nsounds letters make when he saw things in print.  And when we sat down<br/>\ntogether with easy books, sometimes I&#39;d point out something that might help<br/>\nhim.  For example, he tried to say the silent e&#39;s on the ends of words, so<br/>\nwe talked about how e is quiet but manipulative, because he changes the<br/>\nsound of the other letters but doesn&#39;t say anything himself.  And Tim got<br/>\nmad at c, because he&#39;s a thief without a sound but steals s or k&#39;s sound, so<br/>\nyou never knew which sound he was going to be!<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that phonics?  Of course.  But phonetic oriented exposure sounds very<br/>\nteachy, and you don&#39;t need to teach him to read.  He&#39;ll read himself when<br/>\nhe&#39;s good and ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50946,"nextTopicId":51123}}
