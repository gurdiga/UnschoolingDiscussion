So unless your children are<br/>\nallergic to the pesticides (which we know are bad for<br/>\nus all) going Organic will not solve the allergy<br/>\nproblem. Have you thought about seeing a Homeopath or<br/>\na natural healer who deals with allergies? I believe I<br/>\nmentioned on this list my DD who through Homeopathy is<br/>\nasthma free! (it was food allergy related)<br/>\nSomething to think about<br/>\nbest of luck<br/>\nJill<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n The one thing I have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; learned is that I can <br/>\n&gt; trace 3 of the 4 allergies back to my diet when I<br/>\n&gt; was pregnant with them!!! <br/>\n&gt; I have also stumbled upon this concept in a few<br/>\n&gt; books!  So, if any of you <br/>\n&gt; are dealing with food allergies and considering<br/>\n&gt; having more children, watch <br/>\n&gt; your diet when you&#39;re pregnant.  The biggest thing I<br/>\n&gt; learned was to not eat <br/>\n&gt; the same foods all the time and not eating only<br/>\n&gt; craved foods!  You ought to <br/>\n&gt; see me watching for the right child to grab the soy<br/>\n&gt; milk and the other to <br/>\n&gt; grab the cow&#39;s milk in our house!
