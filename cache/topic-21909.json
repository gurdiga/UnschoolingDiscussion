The information about Elsie as recommended literature for Christian<br/>\nHomeschoolers came straight off the Net at various Elsie Dinsmore sites<br/>\nsupported by Christian Homeschoolers.  I added the words &quot;fundamentalist&quot;<br/>\nwhich I believe does describe the form of evangelical Christianity embraced<br/>\nby many Christian oriented Homeschoolers. To take it further---if one<br/>\nmust---I believe they are either Calvinists or Anabaptists but I have not<br/>\nresearched this.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Obviously, I don&#39;t contend that all Christians are embracing Elsie as<br/>\nsuitable child reading matter. I&#39;ve no idea where the &quot;all&quot; came from. I&#39;d<br/>\nnever write it that way because I are one.  I am a practicing Christian who<br/>\ndoes not believe the Elsie books are a good idea 130 years after the fact. <br/>\n<br/>\n3.  All info about Elsie book plots comes from my personal reading<br/>\nexperience. I have read Elsie, Elsie&#39;s Holidays at Roseland, Elsie&#39;s<br/>\nGirlhood, Elsie&#39;s Children, Elsie&#39;s Widowhood,  Elsie&#39;s New Relations and<br/>\nElsie&#39;s Young Folks. I&#39;m about halfway through Elsie&#39;s Womanhood, which I<br/>\njust acquired. And if anybody has any of the Dodd Mead edition Elsie books,<br/>\nlemme know. I want them.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  I know a number of homeschoolers whose orientation is not primarily<br/>\nreligious. I lived in northern Calif.  for many years during the height of<br/>\n&quot;alternative lifestyle&quot;, e.g. I&#39;m an old hippie.  When my son was a child,<br/>\nseveral of his friends were homeschooled for various reasons (their parents<br/>\nbelieved they could do it better than the local public school, they lived<br/>\nin a yurt ten miles up a dirt road impassable much of the year and---my<br/>\npersonal favorite---the local junior high&#39;s main problem wasn&#39;t even drugs,<br/>\nit was prostitution and that girl&#39;s parents couldn&#39;t afford private<br/>\nschool). I don&#39;t think I am innately prejudiced against homeschoolers<br/>\nthough, obviously, I could be wrong about that.  <br/>\n<br/>\n5. Mr. Travilla (Elsie&#39;s husband) forgot to have &quot;obey&quot; removed from the<br/>\nmarriage vow which is just as well since when Elsie finds out what he<br/>\nintended to do, she informs him that she actively wants to obey him, that<br/>\nher obedience passes from her father to her husband. Travilla, poor man,<br/>\nhas been fighting the &quot;obey&quot; thing for twenty years because he thinks his<br/>\nfriend Horace demands too much of his daughter. Travilla is killled off as<br/>\nsoon as possible (in book 6). <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the whole, I&#39;m pleased with the responses that you&#39;ve sent (and do send<br/>\nmore, even the condemnatory ones---the loyal opposition always reveals much<br/>\nabout themselves when on the attack) because I thought what I&#39;d found was a<br/>\nlittle scary. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not alone. Sharon<br/>\n<br/>\n[I&#39;m forwarding her the responses, as you figured out by now.  --Sandra]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21904,"nextTopicId":21910}}
