Here we are saying that kids should decide <br/>\nwhat and when to learn stuff, and then we assume they&#39;ll be ahead of grade <br/>\nlevel.  A kid who chooses not to learn to read until age 10, 12, or even <br/>\nlater is not going to be years ahead of school kids.  He&#39;ll likely have <br/>\nlots of other strengths, but he could well be years *behind* the average <br/>\nschool kid his age, like mine.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":36888606,"authorName":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare","from":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare &lt;nedvare@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: 2248 - Life is not &quot;subject areas&quot;","postDate":"1029534889","msgId":41288,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5ODJBQUVDLjEzQ0ElbmVkdmFyZUBudHBseC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjk0MjIzOTYuMTUzOC44MTEzMS5tM0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":41318,"prevInTime":41287,"nextInTime":41289,"topicId":41288,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"on 8/15/02 10:39 AM, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com at Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com wrote: mierons writes;  Ned responds: Dear mierons, You re on","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-375072236\">on 8/15/02 10:39 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;mierons&quot; writes;  Ned responds:<br/>\nDear mierons, You&#39;re on the right path, now start taking longer steps.

So............. where do I start.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Start by following what you&#39;re telling us -- LET the children make the<br/>\ndecisions. In other words, STOP doing what you&#39;re doing. Life is NOT<br/>\n&quot;subject areas.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I live in Arkansas and they have mandatory testing in the 5th, 7th<br/>\n&gt; and 10th grades. So I have that that I will have to somehow have to<br/>\n&gt; deal with. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>First of all, they probably don&#39;t have &quot;mandatory passing&quot; of those tests,<br/>\nand I can bet the farm that not all the school kids pass all those tests.<br/>\nBy homeschooling, especially unschooling, your kids are almost guaranteed to<br/>\nbe years ahead of school kids, but acadamically and emotionally. So, DON&quot;T<br/>\nWORRY ABOUT TESTS. Homeschooling is not about preparing kids for the tests<br/>\nthat put schoolkids in boxes.  You have some unlearning to do, some<br/>\nde-schooling. UNschool yourself. It&#39;s for the children&#39;s sake.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also would like to know how do you all really teach the kids.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Entirely by example. By being kind to them, nurturing for them, helping them<br/>\nbecome who they want to be. By not doing to them what the schools do to<br/>\nthem, including &quot;teach&quot;. The less teaching that happens, the more learning<br/>\ntakes place. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; know that I have desided this year to try to get as much as I can<br/>\n&gt; off of the internet.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When you get something, be sure NOT to tell the kids about it. Let them get<br/>\nwhat they want from the internet and anyplace else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I would guess the biggest subject area that I<br/>\n&gt; really finding difficult to find is math that is taught as a fun<br/>\n&gt; game that will slowly build up on its self teaching as they have<br/>\n&gt; fun. I would appriciate any help anyone could offer.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Go to www.borntoexplore.org/unschool  and read Luz&#39;s article  called,<br/>\n&quot;A Few Words About Math.&quot;  It will change your ideas about &quot;teaching&quot; math,<br/>\nI&#39;m sure. <br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\nThere are no &quot;Fun Games&quot; if they&#39;re designed to be &quot;educational&quot;<br/>\nWhen prisons show movies, it&#39;s still prison.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41317,"nextTopicId":41286}}
