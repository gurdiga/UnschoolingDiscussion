There are molds shaped like a lamb.  They even sit up, like <br/>\nthey&#39;re kneeling (what&#39;s that position in animals called?

Jesus is <br/>\nrisen, we can eat pig.&quot;  Do they do that in England too?<br/>\n<br/>\nChocolate bunnies are more common than chocolate eggs, as the centerpiece <br/>\ncandy-gift for kids.  Some families do (used to, anyway) the panorama <br/>\nsugar-eggs but I think that&#39;s more German.  There are some very German towns <br/>\nin Texas and lots of them in the MidWest.
