The grand baby is crying and crying in the background and the character played by Barbara Streisand says to the Robert De Nero character; &#39;I think the kid needs a pull or two off that fake boob of yours&#39; and Robert says, &#39;No, we are ferberizering him.&#39; and Barbara says something like, &#39;Ferber! Well The Continuum Concept says we should love and hug and kiss our kids...&#39;  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd I thought Wow! The Continuum Concept mentioned in a movie, as an alternative to something scary and nasty like the Ferber method. And that all happened after my pregnancy aquarobics class yesterday afternoon. Where a woman was talking about these two books &quot;Becoming Baby Wise&quot; and &quot;Becoming Labor Wise&quot; She just raved and raved about them so after the class I drove to our local Borders and found both. I had not heard about either. I was looking through them, and all I could think was ouch, ewww, and reminding myself that we do live in a free country and all. &lt;g&gt; when another woman from my class came up and smiled and said &#39;You wanted to see what all the fuss was about too, huh?&#39; I handed her the books and said &#39;It wasn&#39;t worth the gas to drive over here.&#39; and I moved on to the baby name books. A little while later I watched her put the books back on the shelf, and she turned to me and said &#39;That was scary!&#39; I told her to go to the Library and check out a book called &quot;The Continuum<br/>\n Concept&quot; and she asked me to repeat it and wrote it down. I&#39;m going to wait a week or so and if she hasn&#39;t mentioned it to me I&#39;m going to bring it up in class. &lt;vbg&gt;<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler Waynforth &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:s.waynforth@...\">s.waynforth@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nWhen Simon was an infant there was an episode of Mad About You on that<br/>\nI watched in horror.

The first year in a new house/town, first year the kids went their own separate ways instead of together with mutual friends, (hard on Jack, exciting for Moly) first year I took Jack out instead of Darin... Lots of new things to get used to. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was cold and raining so Jack only went about 6 blocks, but got a pretty good stash. He was happy with it, though I suggested if he wanted I would take him to pick out some more at the store if he felt shorted. He said no thanks and proceeded to list all the good things he had, or was going to have that apparently made up for lack of candy getting time. &lt;g&gt; He said:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got a new house with a big back yard and I am building a fort. Last time Daddy was home we went out to breakfast. Since Daddy probably won&#39;t be home for your birthday, Moly and I will make a day for you. My friend River will be home from his week at his Dad&#39;s tomorrow and I will get to play with him tomorrow night. When we go get Moly you said we are getting hot chocolate and pie or something on the way home. Daddy said he would be home soon, and he would be home the day before Thanksgiving so we can all go to your doctor and see and hear the baby. And we get to find out if the baby really is a Tinkerbell. (what we are calling the baby) Daddy said after your doctor appointment we are going to get tickets to the new Harry Potter movie so we can go watch it after Thanksgiving dinner. (a family tradition of ours to go see a movie in the evening after the dinner and games.) And then on December 1, we are going to Louisiana to see Grandma and Grandpa and everyone will be there! And<br/>\n Santa will come because he always comes to Grandma&#39;s house. And you bought me a big bag of sours the other day so I still have candy at home. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of which made me feel really good since I&#39;ve felt that for the past year or so lots of times my kids have gotten the short end of the stick, so to speak. And Jack just proved to me once again that it is never about the big things I do or Darin does, its all the little things we never think about that are important to the kids. Because some of the things he listed to me were big things, but just as many were little ones. And even more importantly what I heard in his words was that he is happy with his life. The past few weeks have been good, the next few weeks are going to be good, and that is what matters to him. The candy was last, and certainly not as important as many other things.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Halloween Candy Conversation","postDate":"1130949223","msgId":109265,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRrYXBwNytnM29pQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0Ni41MDRkMjFhNS4zMDlhMzIyYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":109260,"nextInTopic":109268,"prevInTime":109264,"nextInTime":109266,"topicId":109250,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So, we&#39;d go right up to the edge of the time <br/>\nlimit, no matter how tired we were.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night we were watching Star Wars episode 3 (hit the stores <br/>\nyesterday) and we had the big bin that his candy was in. He would <br/>\nroam around through it and offer bits and pieces to us, stuff he <br/>\nthought we might like. Some of it will be gone quickly (he&#39;s really <br/>\nliking the glow in the dark star wars trivia wrappers on snickers <br/>\nand musketeers bars) and some will get dumped in a month or so when <br/>\nit&#39;s obvious no one wants it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really is so different - calm, peaceful even, not having to <br/>\nregulate and control and count each piece.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":188356966,"authorName":"Brandie","from":"Brandie &lt;scrapdiva73@...&gt;","profile":"scrapdiva73","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Halloween Candy Conversation","postDate":"1130938219","msgId":109254,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMTAyMTMzMDE5Ljk0OTcucW1haWxAd2ViNTE4MDUubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGRrOWZ2ayszcjd0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":109251,"nextInTopic":109255,"prevInTime":109253,"nextInTime":109255,"topicId":109250,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
