She had been an unschooler in the beginning but as her kids got older she began assimilating into the school-at-home group and became more eclectic.  I knew she was an unschooler-at-heart by the way she talked so I asked her about it. She never goes on the internet so she had no other unschoolers near her so she&#39;s glad I am in the group now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI met a second unschooler in the video store here.  I saw her get out of a van that was painted like tie dye so that peaked my curiosity about her.  I saw her looking at movies with her probably 8 or 9 year old daughter wrapped around her waist.  I knew for sure then that she was one of us.  I approached her and asked her if she was an unschooler.  She was (of course).  Unfortunately she was in the process of moving to another state because it would have been cool to get to know her.  BTW, it was her kids who painted her van.  She bought a whole bunch of spray paint and let them do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":158112576,"authorName":"TeresaBnNC@aol.com","from":"TeresaBnNC@...","profile":"tbb1967","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] finding unschoolers","postDate":"1065194306","msgId":82001,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1OS4yNTkzNGUwZC4yY2FlZWQ0MkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":81999,"nextInTopic":82003,"prevInTime":82000,"nextInTime":82002,"topicId":81993,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/3/03 10:32:19 AM Eastern Daylight Time, genant2@aol.com ... heheh, yeah, I bet it would over a couple hours.. :-)   But so much worth it ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-452990914\">In a message dated 10/3/03 10:32:19 AM Eastern Daylight Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:genant2@...\">genant2@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You would be surprised how far unschoolers are willing to travel to meet <br/>\n&gt; other unschoolers.  <br/>\n&gt; Pam G<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>heheh, yeah, I bet it would over a couple hours.. :-)   But so much worth it <br/>\nfor the good time.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] finding unschoolers","postDate":"1065192279","msgId":81999,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFFMjM2MkI4LUY1QjAtMTFENy1BRUVFLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1LjFhMWE2ODM0LjJjYWVkZWU5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":81995,"nextInTopic":82001,"prevInTime":81998,"nextInTime":82000,"topicId":81993,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
