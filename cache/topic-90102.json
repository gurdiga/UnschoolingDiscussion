I worked with some <br/>\npretty good reading teachers (an oxymoron, perhaps, but I mean in the <br/>\nschooling sense) -- they spent time after school with students, they <br/>\ntried not to shame them, they really tried to build on successes.  <br/>\nBut when I watched these students, whenever printed words were <br/>\nbrought out (as they are so often in school -- instructions, letters <br/>\nto the home, report cards, lunch menus -- nearly everything is <br/>\nprinted), they didn&#39;t bring out their limited reading skills, they <br/>\nbrought out their defense and survival skills.  They might ask the <br/>\nteacher, ask a friend, look around for cues, blow it off, doodle, <br/>\nstart &quot;acting out,&quot; -- whatever.  They didn&#39;t bother looking at the <br/>\npaper (unless their strategy was to pretend to read) -- they&#39;d <br/>\nlearned long ago that what they needed to survive wasn&#39;t going to be <br/>\nthere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo when all the cognitive processes *did* start to come together in <br/>\ntheir brains and they would have been ready to read if they&#39;d been <br/>\nleft alone, everyone missed it.

Unschooling <br/>\nis no absolute guarantee but certainly neither is school (see above) so it <br/>\ncomes down to doing the best you can and making the most of the journey.<br/>\n<br/>\n       OTOH, if you&#39;re asking specifically for an explanation of the <br/>\nstatistical claims about millions of illiterate adults, that&#39;s a whole other kettle of <br/>\nfish.
