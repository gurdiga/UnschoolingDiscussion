I found<br/>\nchildren&#39;s tables you buy too small.  There&#39;s no room on them to spread out<br/>\nthe art supplies - large sheets of paper and what ever books they may be<br/>\nusing.  Mine love to copy pictures from encyclopedias.  So I made up the<br/>\ndimensions (we figured height by having the tallest sit in a child&#39;s chair<br/>\nand seeing where it would hit her best and added an inch or so to take us<br/>\nfew a couple years) - very deep and long and big enough for two - and he<br/>\nbuilt it.  It&#39;s perfect.  Both my 6 and 4 year old sit there voluntarily -<br/>\nit&#39;s the place of choice to head off and do things on their own.  For chairs<br/>\nI have those public school kindergarten metal with plastic seat jobbies.  I<br/>\nhave a realtive who is involved in the local schools and apparently they<br/>\nthrow these things (and desks) out periodically.  We snagged two and they<br/>\nwere in perfect condition.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41751,"nextTopicId":41818}}
