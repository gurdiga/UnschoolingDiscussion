(My third<br/>\nchild was born 7 years after my second, and he has<br/>\nbeen my total joy because I had been told I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;thave any more.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was told that sin in my life kept me from having<br/>\nmore children, or told in a patronizing way, &quot;well,<br/>\ndear, God only gives us just what we can handle...&quot; as<br/>\nif I weren&#39;t as capable of these other mothers of<br/>\nhandling more children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the reason this is amusing to me is that now<br/>\nthat these women are approaching or just past 40,<br/>\nsuddenly all the husbands seem to be getting<br/>\nvasectomies.  They suddenly have a &quot;peace&quot; about not<br/>\nhaving any more children.  Yes, some of them have<br/>\nanwhere from 3 to 8 children, and one family has<br/>\n10...but the husbands are all getting snipped, and it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to do with how many children they have but<br/>\nhow the moms were getting close to 40 and deciding<br/>\nthey were through.<br/>\n<br/>\nwifetovegman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew Yahoo!
