He and a friend named Margaret had <br/>\nborrowed a car from another friend, and in the middle of the night &quot;the car <br/>\nwrecked.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith wasn&#39;t driving.  But Margaret told her mom the WHOLE story without <br/>\nmentioning that.  Details!  There were rocks in the road, the car was <br/>\nraining, the police came, the oil pan was totally off, the transmission was <br/>\njammed, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaret&#39;s mom called me to inquire about Keith, and said &quot;This isn&#39;t the <br/>\nfirst accident Keith has had, though is it?&quot;    It wasn&#39;t an inevitable <br/>\naccident at all, and the driver had not responded well to the police (who <br/>\nwere already behind her with lights on before &quot;the rocks were hit&quot;), and who <br/>\nkept trying to start the car even though nothing was happening and its fluids <br/>\nwere all over the road.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmazing, how the blame was just swirled up into the wind.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Good writing will consist of almost<br/>\nall active voice.
