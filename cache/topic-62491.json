Even then, I would trust the child to<br/>\ndirect his own learning. For it seems to me a fact that, in our struggle to<br/>\nmake sense out of life, the things we most need to learn are the things<br/>\nwe most want to learn. To put this another way, curiosity is hardly ever<br/>\nidle. What we want to know, we want to know for a reason. The reason is<br/>\nthat there is a hole, a gap, an empty space in our understanding of<br/>\nthings, our mental model of the world. We feel that gap like a hole in a<br/>\ntooth and want to fill it up. It makes us ask How? When? Why? While the<br/>\ngap is there, we are in tension, in suspense. Listen to the anxiety in a<br/>\nperson&#39;s voice when he says, &quot;This doesn&#39;t make sense!&quot; When the gap in<br/>\nour understanding is filled, we feel pleasure, satisfaction, relief. Things<br/>\nmake sense again - or at any rate, they make more sense than they did.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we learn this way, for these reasons, we learn both rapidly and<br/>\npermanently. The person who really needs to know something does not<br/>\nneed to be told many times, drilled, tested. Once is enough. The new piece<br/>\nof knowledge fits into the gap ready for it, like a missing piece in a jigsaw<br/>\npuzzle. Once in place, it is held in, it can&#39;t fall out. We don&#39;t forget the<br/>\nthings that make the world a more reasonable or interesting place for us,<br/>\nthat make our mental model more complete and accurate. Now, if it were<br/>\npossible for us to look into the minds of children and see what gaps in<br/>\ntheir mental models most needed filling, a good case could be made for<br/>\ngiving them the information needed to fill them. But this is not possible.<br/>\nWe cannot find out what children&#39;s mental models are like, where they are<br/>\ndistorted, where incomplete. We cannot make direct contact with a<br/>\nchild&#39;s understanding of the world. Why not? First, because to a very<br/>\nconsiderable extent he is unaware of much of his own understanding. <br/>\nSecondly, because he hasn&#39;t the skill to put his understanding into words,<br/>\nleast of all words that he could be sure would mean to us what they<br/>\nmeant to him. Thirdly, because we haven&#39;t time. Words are not only a<br/>\nclumsy and ambiguous means of communication, they are extraordinarily<br/>\nslow. To describe only a very small part of his understanding of the world,<br/>\na man will write a book that takes days to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt<br/>\nfrom How Children Learn<br/>\nDelta 1967, 1983<br/>\n<br/>\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrent Events<br/>\n<br/>\nA small collection of web resources that may be helpful when questions<br/>\nabout the war come up in your home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/war-tech.htm\">http://www.howstuffworks.com/war-tech.htm</a><br/>\nThe HowStuffWorks Technology of War page is a collection of articles on<br/>\nthe  high-tech weapons and defenses that could play a prominent role in this <br/>\nconflict.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chinaberry.com/showutimes.cfm?id=403032701\">http://www.chinaberry.com/showutimes.cfm?id=403032701</a><br/>\nChinaberry Books has suggestions and books for these unsettled times<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/iraq.html\">http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/iraq.html</a><br/>\nMany, many, many maps of Iraq<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/iraq/\">http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/iraq/</a><br/>\nHistory Links from the BBC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers of Memphis<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a sunny Tuesday afternoon in April, 14 children and five mothers wind<br/>\ntheir way down stone steps and around budding trees, blue woodland phlox<br/>\nand yellow wood poppies to the cedar gazebo at Lichterman Nature<br/>\nCenter in Memphis, Tennessee. They meet here monthly on the third<br/>\nTuesday — a free admission day — to listen to stories told by alternating<br/>\nmoms and to observe the changing seasons. The outing is planned for<br/>\nyoung children but today includes two teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo-year-old Zoe squeals her delight at riding on the shoulders of one of<br/>\nthem, Loren, 14. From the gazebo, a few of the bigger boys wander off<br/>\nto explore trails while the others settle noisily on the wood floor. Then all<br/>\nlisten intently as Lynn Carroll-Rivera, mother of three of the children,<br/>\nleads songs about spring, teaches a finger game and then tells a story<br/>\nabout a caterpillar-turned-butterfly who searches for friends. Ravi, age<br/>\nfive, claps his approval for everything. Next it’s snack time, and as the<br/>\nfamilies share the food they’ve brought before hiking to the lake, Carroll-<br/>\nRivera nurses her youngest, 19-month-old Evan.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn many ways today’s outing is school as usual – or &quot;unschool&quot; as usual —<br/>\nfor these Tennessee families. They’re using free local resources, learning<br/>\nfrom nature, sharing their talents, linking age groups, providing loosely<br/>\nstructured activities and giving children choices. They are members of<br/>\nthe Unschoolers of Memphis, a support group that welcomes home<br/>\nschoolers of any religion, race, ethnic background or sexual orientation.<br/>\nThey and about 20 other families come together in large and small<br/>\ngroups, sometimes several times a week, to learn together. <br/>\n<br/>\nRead the rest of the article Open House from Teaching Tolerance<br/>\nMagazine Number 23 Spring 2003 at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tolerance.org/teach/expand/mag/features.jsp?cid=403\">http://www.tolerance.org/teach/expand/mag/features.jsp?cid=403</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:<br/>\n<br/>\nHEM Recipes!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe editors of Home Education Magazine have created a new list: HEM Recipes!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo join the list visit <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HEM-Recipes\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HEM-Recipes</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOr send a blank email message to: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM-Recipes-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">HEM-Recipes-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is designed to be an archive and storehouse of the best <br/>\n<br/>\nrecipes from homeschooling families and friends of homeschooling! <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is meant to be a wide-ranging resource list, a place to not only <br/>\n<br/>\npost your favorite family foods and Kids in the Kitchen ideas for <br/>\n<br/>\nlearning, but for craft recipes (silly putty, goop, gak, bubblestuff, <br/>\n<br/>\nplaydough, fingerpaints, etc.), science experiments (baking soda <br/>\n<br/>\nvolcanoes and food color rainbows), recipes for learning and living, <br/>\n<br/>\nand classics such as this old favorite, which isn&#39;t really a &quot;recipe&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nper se, but indicates the wide range of resources we&#39;ll be featuring:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren Learn What They Live<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Dorothy Law Nolte<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n           If children live with criticism,<br/>\n<br/>\n                They learn to condemn.<br/>\n<br/>\n           If children live with hostility,<br/>\n<br/>\n                They learn to fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n           If children live with ridicule,<br/>\n<br/>\n                They learn to be shy.<br/>\n<br/>\n           If children live with shame,<br/>\n<br/>\n                They learn to feel guilty.<br/>\n<br/>\n           If children live with encouragement,<br/>\n<br/>\n                They learn confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\n           If children live with tolerance,<br/>\n<br/>\n                They learn to be patient.<br/>\n<br/>\n           If children live with praise,<br/>\n<br/>\n                They learn to appreciate.<br/>\n<br/>\n           If children live with acceptance,<br/>\n<br/>\n                They learn to love.<br/>\n<br/>\n           If children live with approval,<br/>\n<br/>\n                They learn to like themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n           If children live with honesty,<br/>\n<br/>\n                They learn truthfulness.<br/>\n<br/>\n           If children live with security,<br/>\n<br/>\n                They learn to have faith in themselves and others.<br/>\n<br/>\n           If children live with friendliness,<br/>\n<br/>\n                They learn the world is a nice place in which to live.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n           Copyright © 1972/1975 by Dorothy Law Nolte<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease pass this post on to support group lists and others who may be <br/>\n<br/>\ninterested!<br/>\n<br/>\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas Come First<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week I was reading to Eric (who is almost 8) from Bedknob and<br/>\nBroomstick. I usually quit at the end of a chapter but decided to end on<br/>\npage 124. He said I should put in a bookmark. I said I would remember the<br/>\npage number, page 124.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was quiet for a few minutes - we were in his bed and I thought he was<br/>\nfalling asleep. Then he said, &quot;Did you notice something funny about that<br/>\nnumber, 124? The 2 is two times the 1 and the 4 is two times the 2.&quot; He<br/>\nthough a bit more and said, &quot;The next number would be 8, then 16, then<br/>\n32, then 64, then (a slight hesitation) 128.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought this was the end of it but he added 256 and 512. We have never<br/>\ndone any math curriculum with him, just everyday math and fun with<br/>\nnumbers stuff, mostly out loud, because I like that kind of thing and he<br/>\nhas a natural ability.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example is from Simon, age 3.5. He was saying words out loud<br/>\nand said some that rhymed. He didn&#39;t know the word &quot;rhyme&quot; but was<br/>\ngetting the concept. He said, &quot;Cat and bat, they&#39;re the same. No, they<br/>\nhave the same letter.&quot; So I said, the word you want is rhyme. Cat and bat<br/>\nrhyme. So now all week he has been finding words that rhyme.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the way they figure things out first, or are introduced to the<br/>\nthing first, then find or are given names for it. It seemed so often in<br/>\nschool we were given names for things (&quot;Class, today we are going to<br/>\nstart Fractions&quot;) and then were taught them, more or less.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDonna Andrea in Nova Scotia<br/>\nFrom a post on the Unschooling-dotcom email list<br/>\nTo read more, join the list by sending a blank email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nOr subscribe by visiting the yahoogroups site at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrogwatch<br/>\n<br/>\nIn recent years, scientists have noticed a disturbing trend among frog<br/>\nand toad populations. Throughout the world, amphibians are disappearing<br/>\nat an alarming rate. Because frogs have porous skin, they are especially<br/>\nsensitive to changes in their environment. They are among the first to<br/>\nsuffer the consequences of human-caused threats, such as pollution, non-<br/>\nnative species introduction, impacts from agricultural and development<br/>\nprojects and increased ultraviolet radiation. As an indicator of greater<br/>\necosystem health, amphibian population decline raises many concerns<br/>\nabout the long-term health of our environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can help scientists learn more about trends in U.S. amphibian<br/>\npopulations by participating in Frogwatch USA. Anyone can participate;<br/>\nall you need is an interest in frogs and toads. Volunteers learn about the<br/>\nlife cycles and calls of local frogs, monitor frogs and toads in local<br/>\nwetland areas and submit frog data via the Frogwatch USA website. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo find out how you can get involved in Frogwatch, visit<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nwf.org/keepthewildalive/frogwatch-app/index.htm\">http://www.nwf.org/keepthewildalive/frogwatch-app/index.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:<br/>\n<br/>\nWeb Snacks<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/neurok.html\">http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/neurok.html</a><br/>\nNeuroscience for Kids.
