I <br/>\ndiscovered when we moved from South Africa to the USA that electric kettles, <br/>\nwhich are the norm where the current is 220 volts are pretty uncommon in <br/>\nAmerica and I had to get used to putting the kettle on the stove (no not my <br/>\nelectric one - although I wouldn&#39;t put that past me ;-).

In our case it was 3 kilowatts (our dishwasher and <br/>\ntwo lights).

I think at the end you&#39;d end up with a ham, some pies, and  <br/>\nsome soap, at least. (Joking about that—I don&#39;t remember what one  <br/>\nthing the recipe was for.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy granny&#39;s recipes always involved pinches and smidgens, teaspoons  <br/>\nand tablespoons, but she used real teaspoons or tablespoons, not a  <br/>\nstorebought set of &quot;measuring spoons&quot; and I learned from her to see  <br/>\nwhat it looked like in the palm of my hand instead of really using  <br/>\nthe spoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, though, I use measuring spoons and have lots of sets of them,  <br/>\nbecause I just like the way they look.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like that butter is sold by the pound, but measured in tablespoons  <br/>\nand quarter cups and half cups. Maybe that&#39;s the intersection, that  <br/>\n1/4 pound of butter is 1/2 a cup, and other measurements come from  <br/>\nbutter.  I don&#39;t know how butter is packaged and marked other places,  <br/>\nbut here (speaking of butter paper, again, so soon), it&#39;s in a light  <br/>\ncardboard box, one pound.  And usually within that there are four  <br/>\nquarter-pound packages, each wrapped in paper.  The paper has  <br/>\nmarkings for half cup, quarter cup, and then all the teaspoon  <br/>\nmarkings starting at the left side, so you can cut it on one of those  <br/>\nlines and add that pre-measured block to a recipe.  Maybe that&#39;s  <br/>\nstill true in all of the English speaking world, and maybe it never was.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy granny (born early 1900&#39;s) got single-pound blocks of butter in  <br/>\nher later years, in sets of commodities she got from the State of  <br/>\nTexas, because she was on welfare to some extent (&quot;getting  <br/>\ncommodities&quot;) in the 1960&#39;s.   She didn&#39;t like for the butter to look  <br/>\nlike it was packaged, because most of her earlier life she had made  <br/>\nher own butter, with a hand churn.  So she would leave the butter out  <br/>\nin a little bowl, and when it got soft she would press it down with a  <br/>\nknife to the shape of the bowl, and leave it in there that way.  That  <br/>\nway it reminded her of homemade butter and she was happier for it not  <br/>\nto be so obvious she had government butter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not the same grandmother who was in Carizozo, New Mexico in  <br/>\nthe Nineteen-teens.

Not for an Aussie! There is an old<br/>\nand reworked joke - two men on the top a snowy mountain (or climbing a<br/>\nglacier or traveling Antarctica) in a blizzard stop and hunker down in the<br/>\nsnowy flurries and icy gale. They open their Esky (Australian for cooler).<br/>\nThey pull out a bottle or can of beer. They pop the top and both take a<br/>\nswig. Moments later they spit it out in huge disgust and exclaim, &quot;Eerrgh!<br/>\nWarm beer!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a renter of houses and flats in Sydney & elsewhere, and when Mom<br/>\nwas a house and condo owner, all the places had in common no dishwasher and<br/>\nno place to insert one. Just not considered standard equipment. Some places<br/>\nhad an insinkerator (sink disposal), but only the most modern condo<br/>\nbuildings. Fridges are just like here, microwaves smaller and not ubiquitous<br/>\nthen as I recall. <br/>\n<br/>\nFree standing ranges with oven below were much more common than wall ovens<br/>\n(a luxury kitchen item). The ranges and stoves all have a feature called a<br/>\n&quot;griller&quot; - what you would consider a broiler - but separate from the oven,<br/>\na slide out drawer just under the hot plates. This applies to gas or<br/>\nelectric. Perfect for those staples of Australian cooking the lamb loin chop<br/>\nand lamb cutlet. I remember the big deal was to have a gas stove and an<br/>\nelectric oven as the height of modernity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to have a large asian style rice cooker - the kind you see at Panda<br/>\nExpress keeping the steamed rice warm. I had toasters, hand held mixer, and<br/>\nblenders. My grandmother always had a Mix Master (like a KitchenAid stand<br/>\nmixer) that she was very proud of. When I lived with electric stoves, I<br/>\ngenerally had an electric kettle. I did my vegetable steaming on the stove<br/>\nwith a stacking set of steaming pans - like a double (triple) boiler with<br/>\nholes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne very useful and important appliance was an electric skillet. We had<br/>\nthose in different sizes all over the world.  Another is a water boiler<br/>\ncalled a &quot;berko&quot; - like an electric kettle but with a wide mouth top instead<br/>\nof a spout - it can be used to heat/cook pretty much any liquid like soups<br/>\nor intant noodles. Lots of folks in dorms had those. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also used to have a rolling clothes washer when in an apartment - twin tub<br/>\nwith a hose that attached to the kitchen faucet. None of the apartments or<br/>\nhouses I ever rented had clothes dryers, only washers in the laundry room.<br/>\nMost people hang their laundry. My mother had a stacked washer & dryer when<br/>\nI was in high school in our house - but it was unusual. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso rare in Australian homes - although that may be changing with the<br/>\nnewest constructions - built in closets in any bedrooms, the coat closet in<br/>\nthe living room, central heat or air. Really - apartments do not come with a<br/>\nfurnace! I never had central heating until I came here, only numerous<br/>\nmethods of room heating such as kerosene heaters or electric ones. One of my<br/>\nenormously wealthy friends had gas powered central heating in her house - it<br/>\nwas a mark of luxury.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother common feature of many of the homes I lived in was instant gas water<br/>\nheaters in the shower/tub and kitchen. You open the flue, light the pilot<br/>\nlight, turn the flame into the heater and &quot;whoomph&quot; the gas lights up and<br/>\nheats the water instantly. Easy adjustments to temperature are made by<br/>\npanning the pilot back and forth. Very efficient and inexpensive end use<br/>\nenergy water heating.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I think there are situations where it&#39;s good for<br/>\npeople to from &quot;relationships of convenience&quot;...but I agree that<br/>\nhomeschooling is not one of those situations.  Here&#39;s a real example from<br/>\nour lives.  We live in Japan.  We&#39;re military, but we don&#39;t live on base--<br/>\nwe live in a Japanese neighborhood and most of our neighbors don&#39;t speak<br/>\nEnglish or eat the same food as we do, or go to the same places, or shop at<br/>\nthe same stores.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an American, school-at-home family just around the corner from us,<br/>\nand they would qualify as this kind of homeschoolers:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt; There are hundreds of thousands of homeschoolers who homeschool<br/>\n </span></blockquote>specifically to keep their children away from families like ours and<br/>\nideas like mine. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn spite of this, we have a very good neighbor-type relationship.  If we<br/>\nwere in the states, theirs would be the last place I&#39;d ask to borrow a cup<br/>\nof sugar, because we are SO different-- except that we live near each other.<br/>\nOur kids play together sometimes, but we just don&#39;t discuss homeschooling<br/>\nexcept in very general terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that there are lots of homeschool families who don&#39;t really<br/>\nunderstand what &quot;support&quot; is.  I think it can even be dangerous to form<br/>\nrelationships or support networks based on the, &quot;You homeschool?  So do we!&quot;<br/>\nprinciple.  On the other hand, sometimes even wildly different homeschool<br/>\nstyles can be a non-issue in a relationship if there is some other source of<br/>\ncommonality involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few random, mulling-it-over-while-drinking-coffee thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nTami, who actually has the only full-size oven in the neighborhood.

I started my journey <br/>\nafter 3 days of kindergarten. Yep, the teacher was an a... and being <br/>\nan older Mom (late 30&#39;s at the time) I thought, &quot;What happened to <br/>\nkindergarten?&quot;.I had no idea. Of course I didn&#39;t get the <br/>\ndaycare/preschool thing either because it didn&#39;t exist when I was a <br/>\nwee one. So I called my LLL Mom friends that were doing it-<br/>\n &quot;homeschooling&quot; and one was sweet enough to drive to my house and <br/>\nhand me the copy of &quot;Why Schools Don&#39;t Educate&quot; and I GOT IT and <br/>\nhere I am. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, we had a small homeschool group for a few years and then some <br/>\nof the Moms started a charter school for homeschoolers. aaarrrggghh <br/>\nI opted out of the testing and they begged me to &quot;do it&quot; or they <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t get their funding...aaarrrgg. And I stood my ground and <br/>\nthen they asked if we would go off the books...so I asked can we <br/>\nstill come here? How am I going to explain this to my little one? <br/>\nAnd they said, &quot;Oh, sure&quot;. Well, the drive was an hour and 10 <br/>\nminutes and then my next daughter was born so I just quit going. As <br/>\nmy little one got older we went to another group 35 minutes away and <br/>\nthey wanted you to sign a &quot;Statement of Faith&quot; aarrggh. Well, a <br/>\ncatholic Mom from the group called me later and after I told her who <br/>\nI was and that I don&#39;t belong to that group she said, &quot;that we need <br/>\nto just support each other because we are homeschooling&quot;. (a kind <br/>\nsoulful lesson that I continue to pass on). So we had some friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, we just moved from small town CA to Idaho. We were in the <br/>\ncountry and the whole family was tired of being so isolated. And my <br/>\n11 year old daughter needed more and my social 3 year old was going <br/>\nto get desperate too but even sooner. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo here we are. I found this site in 1999 and peek in here every <br/>\nonce in awhile to feel connected when so few like minded souls are <br/>\naround. And it works every time!! Thank you for being here everyone. <br/>\nThis area (Boise/Meridian) has tons of homeschoolers with a good mix <br/>\nand they are inclusive on their yahoo groups and there are field <br/>\ntrips, etc. and this place just has tons to do! PE for homeschoolers <br/>\nat the YMCA twice a week, and in the other direction at the Nampa <br/>\nRec center. Homeschool Days at the Discovery Center!! They cater to <br/>\nhomeschoolers!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAre any of you in the Meridian/Boise, Idaho area? I would love to <br/>\nconnect with you.
