Like the Battle of Iwo Jima.  Then you play.  So you <br/>\nmight need to read those parts to him, but otherwise he could play without <br/>\nreading.<br/>\n<br/>\nAxis and Allies, a board game, might be of interest.  They have a European <br/>\nand then a Pacific.  There are four games of it altogether.  The original is old <br/>\n(70&#39;s) but some are by the same company but newer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe says there are alternative reality games involving WWII, but they might <br/>\ninvolve reading.  (Now that he reads well he&#39;s not so aware of whether there was <br/>\nreading or not.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a movie called All the Queen&#39;s Men.  I thought it would be a comedy, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s not.  There&#39;s a child as a minor character which might interest a <br/>\nchild.  But if the parents are offended by innuendo (it would go over a kid&#39;s <br/>\nhead entirely) and cross-dressing, it might not be fun.    But visually, it has <br/>\nquite a bit of 1940&#39;s interest.  Kids wouldn&#39;t follow the plot, probably, but <br/>\nas a jumping off place for parents to discuss alliances, tanks, code machines, <br/>\nPOW camps, air raids. . .<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has Matt LeBlanc and Eddie Izzard.  It&#39;s not &quot;a great movie&quot; (in the &quot;ooh, <br/>\nwhat a Great MOVIE!&quot; way), but it&#39;s also not a bloodfest like battlefield <br/>\nmovies, so they get SOME of the fear and grit without full-on Normandy <br/>\nbayonette-and-granade ballet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids are visual and want a context.  There&#39;s music in it too, which <br/>\nwould give a historical context for kids who categorize their historical periods <br/>\nby which music was popular/new.  (That would be me.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95484,"nextTopicId":95388}}
