A baby who rejects the breast<br/>\nat nine months is voluntarily giving up nursing, they didn&#39;t seem to<br/>\nwant to understand or explore the whole mother/child nursing dynamic<br/>\nand include that dynamic in the solution -- that sort of thing.

Sorry, just<br/>\ncan&#39;t get past that one. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn many ways the whole TCS theory gives me the same sort of feeling<br/>\nthat I get from people who believe that science has all the answers.<br/>\nScience is only as good as the data and the analysis and the mind<br/>\nbias of the person with the theory.
