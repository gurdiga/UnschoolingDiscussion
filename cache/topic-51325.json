I think it&#39;s easy to forget our very verbal <br/>\nlittle one is only 3 sometimes, and when I read from so many posters about <br/>\nthe consideration their kids show for others, I start to wonder if we should <br/>\nbe doing something differently...You&#39;ve made me think, though, and all in all <br/>\nI&#39;d say our Kalie is headed in a good direction. :) One thing that comes to <br/>\nmind is her &quot;excuse me, excuse me, excuse me&quot; when she interrupts - just <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s delivered every 2 minutes or so, at increasing volume and <br/>\nconstantly, all through the day, doesn&#39;t detract from her effort! *smile* And <br/>\nyou&#39;re right - she picked this up on her own, by listening to others. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we&#39;ll just carry on!
