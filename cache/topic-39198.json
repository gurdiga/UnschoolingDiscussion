My son has <br/>\ntaken back the stack of chess books back to the library for now, so he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have any more recommendations at the moment.  We&#39;ve been really busy <br/>\nwith summer stuff, and he&#39;ll get back into chess in the fall probably (or <br/>\nnot!)<br/>\n~Lesley<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39192,"nextTopicId":39200}}
