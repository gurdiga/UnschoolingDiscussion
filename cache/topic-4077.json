A few years ago our little family went through the same thing and it is a <br/>\nvery scary experience.  And yes, our medications were taken as well.  Remember, at that time I was on 14 meds a day and considering that<br/>\nI have severe asthma, severe chronic migraines and rheumatoid arthritis this was some very strong stuff indeed.  I am fortunate enough that<br/>\nthe herbal system I am on now has done away with the need for any of those medications but that doesn&#39;t change the feeling of violation we <br/>\nexperienced or the way we all check and double check the door before we leave and before we enter.  Nor have I quite forgotten the burning feeling <br/>\nin the pit of my stomach when the first officer we dealt with reacted as if we were out of our minds (they took the Medication?) and were taking up <br/>\nhis time.  Fortunately, the second officer we dealt with informed us that we were the third that week in the area to experience such a thing and <br/>\nthat when a robbery is drug related they will almost always just take whatever drugs they can find rather than money.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt will get easier and you are not alone.

We send our <br/>\n&gt;children to Awana on Tuesday nights. Tonight, they called to tell us that our <br/>\n&gt;youngest, Tiffany, was upset and we should come and get her. We left the <br/>\n&gt;house in a rush (Tiffany has Selective Mutism and she is very insecure. When <br/>\n&gt;we hear she is upset, we go now!) and left the door unlocked. We went and got <br/>\n&gt;all the children and picked up McDonald&#39;s on the way home. We saw that the <br/>\n&gt;front screen door was open, and thought that it was odd, but not much... So <br/>\n&gt;we came in and ate. Ron, my dh, went into our bedroom to take a pain <br/>\n&gt;reliever, and this is where everything changed. ALL OF OUR MEDICATIONS ARE <br/>\n&gt;GONE! All of Ron&#39;s pain relievers for the car accident. I am asking for <br/>\n&gt;prayers for both my family and whoever has the meds. That they do not <br/>\n&gt;overdose, and that we are ok with how our life goes. We are on a fixed <br/>\n&gt;income, so we are not able to refill the meds until our insurance picks them <br/>\n&gt;up again. I am so frustrated. I am at wit&#39;s end with this town. I know that <br/>\n&gt;God is good, and that he will make everything right. It is just the horrible <br/>\n&gt;feeling of being violated. Mentally. The officer is here, I need to go. <br/>\n&gt;Thanks for letting me vent, too. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Blessings,<br/>\n&gt;Stephanie<br/>\n&gt;Teacher and Mommy of 4 homeschooling fanatics, wife to the best principal, <br/>\n&gt;protector of many pets and wild ones, and unpublished writer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       I think that I will move closer to the gym, that way between sets,<br/>\n&gt;       I can run home and eat something sweet to keep up my energy! s.<br/>\n&gt;    Believe in others, and be a part; believe in yourself, and be the lead. s.<br/>\n&gt;            ***Life&#39;s Learnings Academy - Protecting Our Children***<br/>\n&gt;        IT&#39;S GREAT TO LEARN WHERE THE PRINCIPAL LOVES YOU<br/>\n&gt;                           ICQ: 43428000     aol IM: Lifeslearn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Check it out!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4072,"nextTopicId":4080}}
