(I love car conversations, my 16yro and I also have some great ones <br/>\nwhen I drive him to and back from the place he teaches snowboarding, it&#39;s <br/>\nabout 45 minutes each way but that&#39;s another post, LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway on the way to the dentist Tom was telling me that he has a lot of <br/>\nfriends and he names off the neighborhood kids plus he adds all the kids he plays <br/>\non sports teams with. Later, on the way back he was telling me that his <br/>\nfriends think he should go back to school to make more friends. I mentioned that he <br/>\nhad said he had a lot of friends already and I wondered what he would do with <br/>\nmore right now? He agreed and said he didn&#39;t know. I also added that I was <br/>\nremembering that he also likes a certain amount of time alone to work on his own <br/>\nstuff and he agreed. He also told me somewhere in this conversation that he is <br/>\na lot more mature than his friends because he is with adults a lot and that <br/>\nhe would be different if he were with kids all of the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomehow we got onto reading and he told me that all his friends know he is <br/>\nnot a good reader and they are OK with it. I wondered if that were still true or <br/>\nwas that just something that was true once but had changed and he hadn&#39;t <br/>\nrealized it, I mean maybe you are a better reader today but you keep saying you <br/>\naren&#39;t a good reader. He thinks he reads OK but not as good as his friends. I <br/>\nasked if he was OK with how well he reads now and he said he was.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about what people could do if they wanted to read better, one thing <br/>\nwas to read more. So you are OK with how you read now and you know some <br/>\nthings to do if you decide you want to read better in the future? And he said yes. <br/>\nSo I told him that was OK with me, that it sounded like he had given this some <br/>\nthought and I was here to help if he ever needed it. This is so powerful to <br/>\nme, knowing that he is aware of the power he has over his own life.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night he asked me if science couldn&#39;t be done just building things like <br/>\nrobots? I feel so privileged to be along on this ride.<br/>\nLaura Buoni<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88726,"nextTopicId":13935}}
