Poor Nathan has <br/>\ntrouble with sunscreens, bug sprays, most soaps and shampoos, cleaning <br/>\nproducts IN ADDITION to food.  Peanuts and highly processed corn are his main <br/>\nallergies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been following Feingold for a while, adapting it to fit our needs.  We <br/>\ndont&#39; see the sensitivity to preservatives as much as to coloring and <br/>\nflavoring.  Anything artificial in those directions makes him a bit, well, crazed.  We <br/>\ndo eat processed foods sometimes and deal with the consequences.  He&#39;s five <br/>\nnow and understands how it makes him feel inside, but will want a lollipop <br/>\noccasionally.  I will say, though, that some of the perceived behavioral issues <br/>\ncome from him being the age he is.  What has been helped with the awareness of <br/>\nhis sensitivities is the &quot;over the top&quot; reactions to situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d do an elimination diet and keep a diary if you suspect some traditional <br/>\ndairy, wheat kinds of allergies.  From what I&#39;ve read, most of the behavioral <br/>\nreactions come from artificial ingredients.  But you were describing some <br/>\nphysical reactions as well, so you  might have the double whammy combo that we <br/>\nhave.  It&#39;s not that hard to work around once you know what foods cause a problem. <br/>\n Our household tries to be free of peanuts, tree nuts, corn syrup, corn <br/>\nstarch, artificial food coloring and flavoring, celery (that&#39;s mine) and perfumed <br/>\nor scented products.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s worth a shot.  Pediatricians seem to have a hard time believing parents <br/>\nwhen there is something not quite right.  I took my four year old daughter in <br/>\non Friday, convinced she had a bladder infection.  The nurses and probably <br/>\neven the doctor were rolling their eyes thinking I was just another mom who <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t believe her little angel would have wetting accidents.  Turns out I was <br/>\nright, after insisting on providing a sample.  Not that it&#39;s a good thing for <br/>\nher to have an infection, it is pretty rare in little kids and there might be an <br/>\nanatomical reason for it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRambling.  Sorry.

Now, my writing is not stellar; I don&#39;t consider myself &quot;a writer&quot;, but <br/>\nI can get my point across.  People love my letters.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think being forced to do it in high school necessarily prepares one <br/>\nfor writing in later life.

I&#39;m a writer myself, and my preferred format are essays. But I CHOOSE to write, and so developing my writing was something I wanted to do, and I sought out opportunities to do so; yet HATED as far as writing for school ie: writing on specific topics others wanted me to write about, how they wanted me to write them, etc. I write for one magazine that requests us to write in the AP style. I don&#39;t particularly care for it, but I choose to write for them, so I choose to write as they&#39;d prefer.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut I&#39;m not going to make her write just because someone else says she hasn&#39;t written enough essays or reports when it&#39;s not vital to her life right now. It may never be important to her. If it is, I&#39;ll do my best to help her develop her writing skills. <br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rowan555@...\">rowan555@...</a> wrote:<br/>\nIn a message dated 12/12/2003 1:48:40 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n...when in the world is she going to need to write essays and such?
