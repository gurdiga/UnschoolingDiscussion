I<br/>\navoid it if I can but I have the luxury of being old enough to tell<br/>\npeople who are trying to make me angry or frustrated or disappointed to<br/>\ntake a hike.   Mostly kids aren&#39;t given the freedom to express themselves<br/>\nwhen they feel things are unfair or mean or too boring or dreadful.  <br/>\nMostly parents are trying to raise nice children who won&#39;t talk back and<br/>\nwhat happens is they feel they have no voice and then those emotions that<br/>\nthey can&#39;t put into words get released some other way.   Your son at ten<br/>\nis a great communicator.   You as a grown up now need to listen.<br/>\n<br/>\n***  DH is telling <br/>\nme I need to put him in public school so he can get an education and <br/>\nget him out of the house for awhile. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes your son want to go to school?<br/>\n<br/>\n***What if unschooling is the answer?  What if the pressure was off and <br/>\nhe just did the things he liked to do and wanted to do.  How do I <br/>\nunschool myself?  It eats me up it they aren&#39;t doing something!  How <br/>\ndo you unschool a teenager, too?  I want her to have a good education <br/>\nand she was in PS for the first four and 1/4 years of her school <br/>\nyears.  So that school stuff is in her head, too.  Will his behavior <br/>\nget better if he is enjoying life instead of being hounded about <br/>\nschool all day long? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you been able to read much about unschooling?  Some people come to<br/>\nunschooling because their school at home life is so stressful, but they<br/>\ndon&#39;t really understand the philosophy and have a hard time with what<br/>\nunschooling really is.   The more you can educate yourself about it, and<br/>\nthis list can help, the more ways you will see that it can be wonderful<br/>\nfor your kids.    My own son is ten and I have to run to keep up with his<br/>\ninterests.  He&#39;s always doing something and if you can get away from the<br/>\nidea that text books and worksheets are the &quot;somethings&quot; they need to be<br/>\ndoing you&#39;ll be able to see the things they enjoy and you&#39;ll be able to<br/>\nhelp them find ways to do those things.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***Do I give him a list of responsiblities around <br/>\nthe house (he doesn&#39;t have a formal list right now, I just assign <br/>\nstuff)and let him do &quot;real life&quot; stuff to get him to learn things <br/>\nwithout him thinking it is school? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t.   Talk with him and tell him you think maybe he&#39;s just<br/>\namazing.   Tell him you want him to be happy.   Tell him you want him to<br/>\ndo the things he loves to do and not worry about school work.  Tell him<br/>\nhe&#39;s so darn smart he doesn&#39;t need that stuff.   Help him find wonderful<br/>\nthings to do and interesting people to talk to.  Let his job be being a<br/>\nkid.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***He soaks up other peoples likes <br/>\nand dislikes, to a certain extent.  He has a friend that he met a <br/>\nyear ago and he has aquired his laugh, much to my dismay.  It is not <br/>\nan attractive laugh.  He has aquired some other bad qualities from <br/>\nhim and I am afraid he will get much more from other kids at school.***<br/>\n<br/>\nHe might see his friend as an interesting person and himself as not so<br/>\nmuch.   You can help him do things he loves to do and in his own eyes<br/>\nbecome an interesting person.   He won&#39;t be as inclined to adopt the<br/>\ninteresting qualities of others if he&#39;s satisfied with the kind of person<br/>\nhe is.   His life needs to be bigger and he needs more opportunity to<br/>\nfind out how cool he really is.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI just told someone who is trying to figure out unschooling to live each<br/>\nday with her kids like she was on a three day vacation in Rome.  If you<br/>\nhad three days in Rome what would you do?   Would you sit in your hotel<br/>\nand make your kids do worksheets about the Vatican or would you get out<br/>\nthere and see stuff and talk to people and sample the food and touch<br/>\neverything you could and jump fully into Rome?<br/>\n<br/>\nTen year olds want to do stuff.  Not yucky, boring school stuff.  Cool<br/>\nstuff.

This approach ­ called the Collaborative<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Problem Solving Approach -- is aimed at decreasing adversarial parent-child<br/>\n&gt;&gt; interactions, reducing family hostility, and improving children&#39;s capacities<br/>\n&gt;&gt; for flexibility, frustration tolerance, communication, and self-regulation.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; he hates worksheets and doesn&#39;t do well under the pressure of a test. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He has a hard time focusing, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If your husband daily made you do things you hate, how well would you deal<br/>\nwith it?

What if regardless of how he explained it and how much he believed in<br/>\nit, it made no sense to you? What if he watched over you and judged what you<br/>\nwere doing against his standards of what was worthwhile for you to do? What<br/>\nif you felt his eyes on you as you turned on the TV for your favorite show,<br/>\nand you knew he prefered you to be reading something educational or doing<br/>\nhousework? What if he thought the meals his mother cooked were the best for<br/>\na family and your ideas were worth less?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Will his behavior<br/>\n&gt; get better if he is enjoying life instead of being hounded about<br/>\n&gt; school all day long?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Would your behavior improve if you were enjoying life and not being hounded<br/>\nby your husband for not sticking to the agenda he felt it was important for<br/>\nyou to follow?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do I give him a list of responsiblities around<br/>\n&gt; the house (he doesn&#39;t have a formal list right now, I just assign<br/>\n&gt; stuff)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They aren&#39;t really responsibilities if someone imposes them on us.<br/>\nResponsibilities are things we feel are important to us and accept for<br/>\nourselves and own. *His* responsibilities are living a joyful life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and let him do &quot;real life&quot; stuff to get him to learn things<br/>\n&gt; without him thinking it is school?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think one of the big hurdles of unschooling is letting go of the idea that<br/>\nwe need to get them to some place that we think they need to be. We think we<br/>\nneed to get them to understand math, for instance, so we try to think of<br/>\n&quot;natural&quot; ways to get them from where they are to where we want them to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo part of unschooling is letting go of that and trusting that people will<br/>\nlearn what they need when they need it. Learning is not artificial. It comes<br/>\nfrom needing something. If someone doesn&#39;t need to know something, then why<br/>\nshould they learn it?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou probably don&#39;t need to know about Mongolian history. But if you needed<br/>\nto know, wouldn&#39;t you learn it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I meant by real life learning was teaching him how to cook and make up<br/>\n&gt; menus and such, shopping for that menu, having an assigned day that he does<br/>\n&gt; the meal planning and cooking?  Things like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Those can all be part of unschooling if *he* thinks they&#39;re fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut rather than thinking in terms of finding things he could learn from,<br/>\nlearn yourself to see the things he learns in what *he* does. And do things<br/>\nbecause they&#39;re enjoyable not because the kids could learning something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know what my heart is telling me, I<br/>\n&gt; just have to figure out a way to get dh to understand it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe you could print out all your emails and the replies for him to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85 &lt;sheran@ptd.net&gt;","from":"&quot;kayb85 &lt;sheran@...&gt;&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: New to group and many questions wanting many answers","postDate":"1045383946","msgId":59089,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGIybmh1YStkbGU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PE9NRUdMRkVDQkpGSklBTUtGRURFQ0VMQ0NOQUEuYW5nZWxtb20xMTY1QGF0dGJpLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":59086,"nextInTopic":59097,"prevInTime":59088,"nextInTime":59090,"topicId":59072,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... make up ... he does ...

I have a dd <br/>\nin the 11th grade, a ds in the 5th grade, a ds who will be 4 in April <br/>\nand a dd who is 17 months old.  I stumbled across this list in search <br/>\nof answers to the problem of getting ds (10) to do &quot;school&quot;.  He is a <br/>\nchild with many &quot;problems&quot;.  He has problems with anger and <br/>\nfrustrations and dealing with disappointments.  I think, looking <br/>\nback, it might be because of trying to get him to do &quot;school&quot; the way <br/>\neveryone sees school and does homeschool, for the most part.  he <br/>\nhates worksheets and doesn&#39;t do well under the pressure of a test.  <br/>\nHe has a hard time focusing, too.  Except on video games!  He is very <br/>\nstuborn and so am I, so we tend to clash, wonder why!  DH is telling <br/>\nme I need to put him in public school so he can get an education and <br/>\nget him out of the house for awhile.  I am waring inside myself about <br/>\nit.  Everything in me says NO.  Except for the fact that I might have <br/>\nsome time without having to deal with his behavior.  But, here is a <br/>\nthought....<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if unschooling is the answer?  What if the pressure was off and <br/>\nhe just did the things he liked to do and wanted to do.  How do I <br/>\nunschool myself?  It eats me up it they aren&#39;t doing something!  How <br/>\ndo you unschool a teenager, too?  I want her to have a good education <br/>\nand she was in PS for the first four and 1/4 years of her school <br/>\nyears.  So that school stuff is in her head, too.  Will his behavior <br/>\nget better if he is enjoying life instead of being hounded about <br/>\nschool all day long?  Do I give him a list of responsiblities around <br/>\nthe house (he doesn&#39;t have a formal list right now, I just assign <br/>\nstuff)and let him do &quot;real life&quot; stuff to get him to learn things <br/>\nwithout him thinking it is school?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know I am asking so many questions and seem so confused, too <br/>\nconfused to have done this for so many years, but I am none the less, <br/>\nasking for your help.  I love my children so much and I feel that if <br/>\nI put my ds in PS, I will be failing him and setting him up for so <br/>\nmany things I don&#39;t want for him.  He soaks up other peoples likes <br/>\nand dislikes, to a certain extent.  He has a friend that he met a <br/>\nyear ago and he has aquired his laugh, much to my dismay.  It is not <br/>\nan attractive laugh.  He has aquired some other bad qualities from <br/>\nhim and I am afraid he will get much more from other kids at school.  <br/>\nI just don&#39;t know what to tell my dh about all this.  He thinks I <br/>\njust won&#39;t listen to him when he suggests things.  NO, just not <br/>\nthat.  I know I am rambling.  Please forgive me.  I am at my wits end <br/>\nover this.
