Frills such as hobbies or reading for<br/>\npleasure must be kept within strict bounds and mostly reserved for<br/>\nretirement years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, there will be limited time for things like relationships and<br/>\nmaintaining the home.  But the bulk of energy and attention needs to be<br/>\nfocused where it matters most:  on making money for our economy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, our children can&#39;t start early enough learning how to be the best cog<br/>\nthey possibly can be in the all-important economic machinery.  They&#39;ve got<br/>\nto get used to the idea that &quot;living it up&quot; means running from one organized<br/>\nevent to the next each and every day of their lives.  From school to<br/>\nafterschool lessons to soccer practice to fast food pitstop for dinner to an<br/>\nevening of homework assignments:  this is the ideal way a child should be<br/>\nraised; particularly one for whom the parents have &quot;high hopes.&quot;  If<br/>\nfollowed consistently up through adolescence, this plan will invariably<br/>\nproduce young adults who are eminently qualified to step right into the hot<br/>\ncareers of tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren need their lives scripted to the greatest extent possible.<br/>\nExperience has shown that where parents fail to do this, their children are<br/>\nfar more likely to develop non-traditional views about the meaning of<br/>\nsuccess or uneconomic ideas of how a life should be lived.  Conscientious<br/>\nparents who truly care about their childrens&#39; future will spare no expense<br/>\nor effort to ensure this doesn&#39;t occur.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn O.
