Not only will he try to sing ALL the <br/>\nvocal parts instead of picking just one, but he also uses his voice to imitate <br/>\nall the instruments and sound effects from his favorite songs, movies and <br/>\nshows. Hearing him do the theme to Star Wars or Indiana Jones or Duck Dodgers is <br/>\nquite an experience!<br/>\n<br/>\n       Duck Dodgers is based on Daffy Duck, which led DS  to golden-oldie <br/>\nLooneyTunes, so for a couple of months now, he&#39;s been falling asleep to a CD with <br/>\nclassical cartoon tracks such as What&#39;s Opera Doc? -- be vewwy quiet, I&#39;m <br/>\nhunting wabbit -- and the Bugs and Elmer Fudd spoof on the Barber of Seville <br/>\n(Figaro, Figaro, Feeeee-garo!)<br/>\n<br/>\n       Because he&#39;s been so excited about this of late, we&#39;ve been looking <br/>\nfor classic LooneyTunes on DVD. Friday we went out to a book and music shop near <br/>\nthe university here, in a terrible rainstorm, because the day before his <br/>\nvoice coach had suggested it to him as a possible source, after they&#39;d finished <br/>\nsinging Animaniac songs together. <br/>\n<br/>\n       BTW, it seems the Animaniacs also are tv cartoons, from Steven <br/>\nSpeilberg, but neither I nor DS had ever heard of them. Odd, with all the screen time <br/>\nwe enjoy! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n       Anyway, we struck gold literally, found a four-disc set, the <br/>\nquintessential Golden LooneyTunes Collection.<br/>\n<br/>\n       And we watched it together, all of Friday night and all day Saturday, <br/>\npractically without breaks. Laughing our heads off and talking about <br/>\neverything under the sun. It was deeply satisfying. :)  JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90564,"nextTopicId":90582}}
