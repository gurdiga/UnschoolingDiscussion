She <br/>\nwas afraid that it would appear to him that we thought of him as her boyfriend when he is <br/>\nreally just a friend. I could totally understand this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI explained that my dh and I felt better knowing him first before she spends days at his <br/>\nhouse just like we know the rest of her friends. Then we&#39;ll have no problem with them <br/>\nhanging out together there.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was okay with that but wondered how to handle the potential awkwardness of his <br/>\ncoming here. She solved her own problem. :) She invited another girlfriend to come too. <br/>\nThey are making an Internet forum all three together.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I promised to keep little ones occupied elsewhere to prevent their being an <br/>\nembarrassment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do have a relationship that is built on trust. It&#39;s a reciprocal trust - I do trust her <br/>\njudgment, but I also want her to trust me when I have a little red flag. We discussed this <br/>\nand she agreed that was valid.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal we have is for everyone to feel good about stuff, not just one side while the other <br/>\nstifles their feelings.

Even if both of them are nice <br/>\npeople it would be very tempting for something to happen if they are possibly <br/>\nromantic and alone. I would talk to her and say exactly that. Maybe she isn&#39;t <br/>\nreally interested and she doesn&#39;t realize that he is. What does she do if he tries <br/>\nsomething and takes her by surprise? Is she ready for that? 14 is so young. I <br/>\nthink it is a very difficult situation she is putting herself in. Maybe it is <br/>\nher way of wanting you to stop her by telling you she is doing this. Maybe she <br/>\nis at least looking for guidance even though she acts like you are just <br/>\nannoying her. <br/>\n       I would strongly discourage it. You know your daughter. Some kids <br/>\nwould still do it and keep it a secret. If that happens, at least she&#39;ll have <br/>\nheard your advice and hopefully you don&#39;t have a pregnant 14 year old. I snuck <br/>\naround when I was 19 or 20 but 14 sounds so young.

It really<br/>\ndepends on how much you trust your daughter. And not just to say no to bad<br/>\ndecisions, but to think her way out of any problems and situations that may<br/>\narise. (no pun intended)<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, you can tell her you are uncomfortable with her going over to an<br/>\nempty house with this boy. When situations came up concerning my teen<br/>\ndaughter, I would talk to her about my insecurities and questions which<br/>\nusually led to her making me feel better, just by listening to her, voicing<br/>\nmy concerns and having her talk them out with me. Have you spoken to your<br/>\ndaugher at all about how you feel and why? That could possibly have her<br/>\nunderstand and maybe compromise on you meeting the friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she goes, what are you afraid of? Guns, drugs, sex, violence? How do you<br/>\nfeel about what she would do if any of these things were around and<br/>\npresented to her? You seem pretty confident in her making good choices for<br/>\nherself. If you don&#39;t allow her to go, she can easily become involved in<br/>\nsuch matters by saying she&#39;s going to the movies and then going elsewhere.<br/>\n&quot;Where there&#39;s a will there&#39;s a way&quot; is very true.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found in my personal experience, the times I have allowed my daughter<br/>\nfreedoms I was wondering about turned out very well. It was when I had a<br/>\nhold on her that she found things to get into that weren&#39;t the best choices<br/>\nfor her. And even at that, my daughter has learned from those mistakes and<br/>\nis the kind of person that has to find out for herself anyway. I just think<br/>\nI would have saved us a lot of trouble and helped the trust we have together<br/>\nnow if I would have eased up with her sooner than I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut again I think it depends on the child and on how the parents feel about<br/>\nthe situation in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of my daughter&#39;s friends parents refuse to let their kids have friends<br/>\nover the house to hang out. My daughter&#39;s newest date is amazed that she can<br/>\nbring him here after she gets off work at 11-11:30. He doesn&#39;t have a car<br/>\nnow so she often takes him home at 3, 4 or even 5 in the morning if they<br/>\nhave fallen asleep watching a movie. Now he&#39;s allowed to stay out that late,<br/>\njust not with friends at his house. Where could a teenager go if they like<br/>\nto stay up late and not be allowed home with friends? You can only hang at<br/>\nthe beach for so long. My daughter doesn&#39;t get parents who freak when their<br/>\nkids run into trouble out and about yet they aren&#39;t allowed to hang out at<br/>\nhome.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my house is always open to her friends no matter what time it is. And<br/>\nthey are actually here more than they are out and about. And by her feeling<br/>\nvery comfortable to bring them here, she is here with them often and I do<br/>\nknow the kids pretty well. Her newest date I didn&#39;t know well at all. After<br/>\na few times of them going out, she brought him here. They rented a movie and<br/>\nbrought fast food in and hung out all night. I went in her room and had a<br/>\nchance to talk to him about a lot of things for about 20 minutes or so. Made<br/>\nme feel good she&#39;s hanging out with a nice kid. And if she wouldn&#39;t feel<br/>\ncomfortable here or I wouldn&#39;t &quot;allow&quot; her here with friends, I would never<br/>\nknow that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, she also knows that my converstaion never turns to<br/>\ngrilling her friends. And she knows I will keep a check on my husband so he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t pull any embarrassing behavior by scaring the crap out of the poor<br/>\nkid. He can be intimidating and not really mean to be. So we made<br/>\ncompromises too. And we all understand that. And when situations come up<br/>\nthat I&#39;m not sure about, I come right out and talk to my daughter about<br/>\nthat. We are always able to figure something out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Knowing your kids&#39; friends","postDate":"1078339148","msgId":91569,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkNS4xYjcwZTRhYi4yZDc3ODA0Y0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":91568,"nextInTopic":91571,"prevInTime":91568,"nextInTime":91570,"topicId":91568,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/3/04 11:26:15 AM, julie@bravewriter.com writes:  That s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1539775683\">In a message dated 3/3/04 11:26:15 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:julie@...\">julie@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Still, she resisted.

If she&#39;s being different with him than at home, that might be an <br/>\nindicator.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Any advice for how to handle this would be greatly appreciated.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you know his parents?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe in true negotiator style you could tell her that before she visits his <br/>\nhouse, maybe he AND HIS PARENTS should come over that day.  Maybe his whole <br/>\nfamily.  That will seem way huge to her and she could say &quot;no, too much,&quot; and <br/>\nyou could say &quot;Okay, how about just him?&quot;  And maybe her relief at not having to <br/>\nhave his whole family over will make it seem small.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike the Jewish story about the house that&#39;s too small, and the rabbi advises <br/>\nbringing the chicken in.  Next week &quot;My wife&#39;s complaining that the house is <br/>\ntoo crowded.&quot;  &quot;Bring in the goat.&quot;  Etc. for a few weeks until &quot;My wife is <br/>\nfurious now because she can&#39;t even turn around.&quot;  &quot;Okay, take all the animals <br/>\nout.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the house seemed plenty big!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Knowing your kids&#39; friends","postDate":"1078338062","msgId":91568,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMyNTdtZStlaTI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":91569,"prevInTime":91567,"nextInTime":91569,"topicId":91568,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How important is it to you that you know your children s (in our case, teens) friends?

Our kids <br/>\nhave been great and I have no complaints about how they&#39;ve handled themselves. It was a <br/>\nhuge adjustment for us, but we&#39;ve made it. And I&#39;m happy with how things have gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs usual, new situations arise that force me to rethink my attitudes again.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I&#39;m faced with a developing friendship between our 14 yog and an 18 yob. So <br/>\nfar, they aren&#39;t romantically involved. They go to the mall or afternoon movies together <br/>\nand spend a lot of time on IM. They&#39;ve gone to a concert too with my older son and <br/>\nanother boy so there were four of them together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve met the boy but haven&#39;t actually chatted with him. He&#39;s never come to our house, but <br/>\nmy daughter has good judgment and he seems to be a decent person.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis weekend, my dd wants to go to his house for the afternoon. I asked her to invite him <br/>\nhere so we could get to know him a bit before she&#39;s spending time alone with him at his <br/>\nhouse. She said that our big family makes her feel embarrassed when friends come (the <br/>\nyoungers can be very inquisitive). I promised her to keep them out of her way (we have <br/>\nactivities that day that would help the focus not be on her new friend).<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, she resisted. She likes keeping her friends separate from family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I feel a dilemma. I&#39;m not that comfortable with their being alone in his house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also know that my husband won&#39;t be keen on sending her to a boy&#39;s house when we don&#39;t <br/>\nactually know the boy (we really just know about him).<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice for how to handle this would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91553,"nextTopicId":91604}}
