We didn&#39;t last one day at that,<br/>\nthank goodness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t take long for me to discover deschooling and unschooling.<br/>\nSandra and unschooling.com played a large roll in my discovery and our<br/>\nprocess and I&#39;ve been a very grateful (mostly quiet) member on this list<br/>\nsince then.<br/>\n<br/>\nInitially, I was struck by what I perceived as Sandra&#39;s bluntness but,<br/>\nbeing who I am, I liked it.  A lot.  Many, many of her postings have<br/>\nreally helped me and my family.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, I saw her speak at the HSC conference.  I was surprised to<br/>\nhear how funny she is.  Delightful!  If you&#39;ve been on the net for any<br/>\ntime at all, I think you&#39;ve probably figured out that you really can&#39;t<br/>\nput an accurate &quot;tone of voice&quot; on someone&#39;s postings a lot of the time,<br/>\neven with all the little emoticons we have developed.  Sometimes, you<br/>\njust read it wrong; it&#39;s so easy to misinterpret the feeling with which<br/>\nthe words are written.  After some painful mistakes, I try not to assume<br/>\nthat anyone is feeling what I think they are as I read their words.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs school started up again this year and my daughter expressed some<br/>\ndesire to go to middle school, I felt desperate to find a way to get her<br/>\nto agree to give homeschooling more of a chance.  I turned again to<br/>\nSandra&#39;s words and unschooling.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found Sandra&#39;s article with the suggestion of paying her half (or all)<br/>\nof what we&#39;d spend  if we sent her to public school.  We didn&#39;t end up<br/>\nneeding to do that but I take great comfort in having that idea as my<br/>\nlast resort.  Again, she has agreed (with occasional mixed feelings --<br/>\nall of which we are trying to address) that she wants to homeschool.  At<br/>\nthis age, at this time, in this town, I&#39;m willing to go to great lengths<br/>\nto have her agree to homeschool.  (I don&#39;t think I&#39;m willing to force<br/>\nhomeschooling, to actually prohibit public school if she makes up her<br/>\nmind but we haven&#39;t yet gotten to that point.)  Later on, we shall see.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has not been an easy year for us.  I&#39;ve had to look at myself and<br/>\nmy behavior a lot.  I needed to challenge many of my assumptions and<br/>\nbeliefs and many of them have had to change.  Sandra, more than anyone<br/>\nelse, has helped me in that uncomfortable process.<br/>\n<br/>\nI owe Sandra an enormous debt of gratitude.  I&#39;ve never talked to the<br/>\nwoman and she doesn&#39;t have a clue who I am.

So while I feel the age/wisdom from you, I can also <br/>\nrelate in a not too distant way to you because your children aren&#39;t grown and <br/>\nmarried. I think you offer direct truth, which can be very painful when we <br/>\nare too far from truth. And with my own tv debate, I got upset by your direct <br/>\npoint-blank manner, because it hurt. But it only hurt because it was true. <br/>\nBut then I had to ask myself, would I rather someone spare my feelings and <br/>\nlet me go in the wrong direction or speak truth that may hurt me but <br/>\nultimately help me and my son. I&#39;d much rather someone tell me. Otherwise, me <br/>\nand my untruths have just been dismissed, disregarded, unchanged.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ll stick up for ya too. I haven&#39;t followed all the debates and <br/>\nbickering, but I&#39;m very grateful that you&#39;re on here. I would certainly hope <br/>\nthat no one would verbally attack me for admiring someone&#39;s wisdom and <br/>\nwishing to learn from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"discovery6@aol.com","from":"discovery6@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"PWca9u6R2tVgGRSeXJDjClGM7p6I2tFuljtOfWh37eFR1KMWi09juVm3P43BHaqPUSG5WMJFnYuw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] My purpose in being on this list","postDate":"1000417357","msgId":25572,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYuMWFiZTY3ZTAuMjhkMjgyNGRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":25567,"nextInTopic":25575,"prevInTime":25571,"nextInTime":25573,"topicId":25567,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/13/2001 12:41:36 PM Central Daylight Time, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1312246376\">In a message dated 9/13/2001 12:41:36 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; The shouting down of an individual with a few supporters will not keep me <br/>\n from helping unschoolers. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that you have helped countless people Sandra and I am sure that most <br/>\ndo not want you to leave this list.
