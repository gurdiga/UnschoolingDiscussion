Sometimes you may never find it - but it is the act <br/>\n&gt; of looking for it that builds your character.  I don&#39;t think killing other <br/>\n&gt; people in the name of religion is the answer - obviously.  To me it appears <br/>\n&gt; very logical - if your religion preaches that it is necessary to hurt or <br/>\n&gt; rid the world of others that don&#39;t believe as you do - I would think you&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; start searching for the real truth. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heather........Love ya girlfriend....thanks so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have even cleared some things up for me. We are always learning....I am <br/>\nalways learning......<br/>\nI have those little voices that say hey.....what are you thinking here... You <br/>\nare right killing people for the sake of religion is not the answer and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; if your religion preaches that it is necessary to hurt or rid the world of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>others that &gt;don&#39;t believe as you do - I would think you&#39;d start searching <br/>\nfor the real truth. <br/>\nI agree with so much of what you said....... I think so much about my  <br/>\nancestors and what they went through being forced to someones way of life and <br/>\nthinking, often brutally done.<br/>\nYou have caused me to think again and have a  better about my decision to do <br/>\nthings or make the choices that I have made.I feel better about the road that <br/>\nI am traveling.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But you can&#39;t find it by listening to someone tell you - you need to find it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for &gt;yourself. It is in the same nature we discuss education. You can&#39;t TEACH <br/>\na child - &gt;you can only lead them to the water - and let them drink - if they <br/>\nso choose. You &gt;can&#39;t make anyone see your way -<br/>\nAgree again........I see it all the time where people are forced to accept a <br/>\ncertain way or belief . It could be the choice of wanting to eat or <br/>\nstarve....if you want to eat or want this morsel of bread....it&#39;s my way or <br/>\nif you don&#39;t starve.<br/>\nIt does not say to treat people this way......Where are the <br/>\nteachings......true teachings......why won&#39;t they release the other <br/>\nbooks/chapters of the bible?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You can&#39;t TEACH a child - you can only lead them <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t this why w homeschool? We don&#39;t want them in that dictative <br/>\nnon-educating insitution. We don&#39;t want the to be forced to be this and do <br/>\nthat. We don&#39;t want their education, non-values, non-morals forced on our <br/>\nchildren so we have them home.......Isn&#39;t it the same with religion when <br/>\nsomeone tries and force their ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather......thank-you for your thoughts and insight for today.....<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2205","postDate":"1028746546","msgId":40147,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJmLjJiMGRkNGQ1LjJhODJjNzMyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40144,"nextInTopic":40149,"prevInTime":40146,"nextInTime":40148,"topicId":40139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/7/02 12:40:32 PM, lurningathome@aol.com writes:  But","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-120769308\">In a message dated 8/7/02 12:40:32 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurningathome@...\">lurningathome@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; People buy the would and have it <br/>\ncut....They leave good size pieces behind.....  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they might not have saws at their houses.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sometimes a longer piece is cheaper than a shorter piece just because <br/>\nit&#39;s standard, or on sale, or something.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":51989482,"authorName":"rsale515@cs.com","from":"rsale515@...","profile":"rsale515","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2205","postDate":"1028745685","msgId":40144,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyYS4xNTU5ZTU3Mi4yYTgyYzNkNUBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40143,"nextInTopic":40147,"prevInTime":40143,"nextInTime":40145,"topicId":40139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/7/2002 11:27:13 AM Pacific Daylight Time, ...
