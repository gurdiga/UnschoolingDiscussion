Our \n  cats<br>don&#39;t go outside for all the reasons the Humane<br>Society warned us \n  against it when we adopted them, but<br>for three other reasons, too. First, \n  we love birds and<br>have feeders, and we don&#39;t want birds eaten or \n  even<br>scared away by the cats. Next, like you said, it seems<br>unsanitary \n  to let animals who go outside and get into<br>who knows what come in and walk \n  around on your bed.<br>And your table and counters when you&#39;re not looking. \n  I<br>walked a friend&#39;s dog for 6 weeks when she broke her<br>ankle, and the \n  dog would walk RIGHT THROUGH other<br>dogs&#39; poop, and then go home and hop \n  onto my friend&#39;s<br>couch. Third, we have allergies, and it&#39;s bad enough<br>to \n  deal with cat fur without dealing with the pollen<br>they&#39;d bring in with them \n  if they went outside.<br><br>I admire your plans for animal rescue. After we \n  saw a<br>dying loon on the beach, we called an animal rescue<br>person to ask \n  what to do in the future in those<br>situations. She was incredibly helpful \n  and spent an<br>hour on the phone educating us, just out of her love<br>of \n  animals. Now we feel prepared to help birds of all<br>sorts!<br><br>But this \n  isn&#39;t about unschooling (except in the way<br>everything&#39;s unschooling)so I \n  apologize. I was just<br>curious. \n  Juli<br><br><br><br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do \n  You Yahoo!?<br>Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!
