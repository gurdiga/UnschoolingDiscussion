Armored guys with their rattan swords, <br/>\nsix at a time, around a tree, and each had to hold a rope.  First pass, you <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t engage the guy next to you in combat, you had to skip over to another <br/>\none.  So they had a handicap, and ropes in the way, and in a bit only one guy&#39;s <br/>\nstill up.  I didn&#39;t even ask Keith how well he did, and he didn&#39;t tell me, <br/>\nbecause that wasn&#39;t the important part of the story.  It was a new game he had <br/>\nnever played or seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne they do lots, which takes no preparation, is &quot;bear pit,&quot; and it&#39;s just <br/>\none guy taking challengers.

And it&#39;s a good way for newer SCA combatants to get to <br/>\nfight experienced guys without the trouble of negotiating a lesson, or of <br/>\nentering a formal tournament, and they can keep getting back in line if they want <br/>\nto, or wander off if they want, without pressure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] about playing, and older kids","postDate":"1083807765","msgId":93549,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Mi4yOGFiNmVlMy4yZGNhZjIxNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":93540,"nextInTopic":93560,"prevInTime":93548,"nextInTime":93550,"topicId":93514,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/5/2004 6:31:29 PM Eastern Daylight Time, dezigna@comcast.net writes: James wants to do a Ham Funshop at the conference.
