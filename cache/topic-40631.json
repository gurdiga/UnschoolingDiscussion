Spanish is my first language and I have a different <br/>\nexperience --because my husband does not speak it, my oldest did not <br/>\nwant to speak it or even hear it until recently.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I don&#39;t know how old your daughter is but my kids like JUMPSTART <br/>\nSPANISH (they are 5 & 2.5, though) Evan actually did not like the <br/>\nStandard Deviants (he will watch anything) and Muzzy is too expensive <br/>\nso,<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Since you are into letting them watch TV, check out your local <br/>\nSpanish Channels like TELEMUNDO and UNIVISION. They have MTV-Latino, <br/>\nMundoNick (Nickelodeon in Spanish) and dubbed movies. And of course, <br/>\nthere are the news and telenovelas. Of course, there is Dora The <br/>\nExplorer on Nickelodeon.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) A lot of DVDs come with a foreign language version of the movie. <br/>\nThat is a good resource as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) What kind of music does she like? If you give me an idea, I&#39;ll <br/>\nsteer you to some groups<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Yahoo! has portals for Spain and other Latin American countries. <br/>\nThat is a good way to read and find out what the Spanish speaking <br/>\ncyber-world looks like. There are the sites for PBSKIDS & MUNDONICK <br/>\nwith lots of games<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Lots of the old LIVING BOOKS CD-ROMs are bilingual as well <br/>\n(especially the ARTHUR ones).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, more than any &quot;learning tools&quot;, think about the challenge of <br/>\nmeeting Spanish speaking people. Is there a community of Latinos <br/>\naround you? Are there places people meet like restaurants, markets, <br/>\nchurches, even library hours? Again, I do not know how young or old <br/>\nyour daughter. Young children will acquire languages that their <br/>\nparents speak. I think that preteens and over have more of a sense of <br/>\nself and would not rely on your knowing the language BUT they&#39;ll <br/>\neither loose interest or their learning process will get &quot;stunted&quot; <br/>\nbecause they have no way of putting those new skills to good practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLiza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Has anyone on this list had experience with either the Cashflow 101 or<br/>\n&gt;Cashflow for Kids boardgames or the PowerGlide language course?
