My biggest concern is how young she is and how old he is.  I <br/>\n&gt; realize <br/>\n&gt; there is onyl a two year+ difference, but 12 and 14 are so different, <br/>\n&gt; maturity wise.  Scott has a 12 yr old brother, so I&#39;m hoping he can see <br/>\n&gt; that.  As far as him having no personal interest or not being a suitor <br/>\n&gt; though, I&#39;m not really sure.

Socially, he&#39;s really not. <br/>\nNow, you&#39;ve met this kid and I haven&#39;t, but in my experience with teenagers, <br/>\nmost girls DO mature much faster than most boys. In most cases a 12 year old <br/>\ngirl and a 14 year old boy are kind of on par as far as social maturity goes. <br/>\n(Clearly there are exceptions, and I really don&#39;t blame you for being concerned.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are MAJOR advantages to have a &quot;romance&quot; with someone who lives far <br/>\naway when you&#39;re very young. You get the warm squishy feelings without all the <br/>\npressure. You can talk on the phone and giggle and think about how cute the <br/>\nother person is, but you don&#39;t actually have to deal with them on a day-to-day <br/>\nbasis.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71052,"nextTopicId":71138}}
