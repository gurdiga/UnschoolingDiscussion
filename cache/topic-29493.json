An annual assessment must be filed<br/>\n&gt; with the State Department of Education which must consist of one of the<br/>\n&gt; following:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. annual standardized test or,<br/>\n&gt; 2. a local test or,<br/>\n&gt; 3. review of progress by a Maine certified teacher or a local advisory<br/>\n&gt; board selected by the superintendent or a home school support group that<br/>\n&gt; includes a Maine certified teacher. Rules Sec. 3(J).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To be honest, I&#39;m not sure if it is possible to unschool in a state like<br/>\n&gt; Maine.  They require annual testing.  Can you find out how many years in<br/>\n&gt; a row your child can fail the test before she&#39;s required to go back to<br/>\n&gt; school?  I think the longer a child has the opportunity to unschool, the<br/>\n&gt; better.  The older s/he is, the better s/he will be able to put up with<br/>\n&gt; the bull the state requires without much harm to her psyche.  That&#39;s my<br/>\n&gt; personal opinion.  I honestly don&#39;t know how else to advise you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you have not read John Holt&#39;s &#39;Learning All the Time&quot;, please do so.<br/>\n&gt; It is an excellent introduction to unschooling.  Alfie Kohn&#39;s &quot;Punished<br/>\n&gt; by Rewards&quot; is also an excellent book.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mimi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Thursday, December 6, 2001, at 08:37 PM, John & Melissa Morgan wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We are in Maine.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Melissa<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: groundhoggirl<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Thursday, December 06, 2001 9:15 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] OK here is my question :0) How do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they learn??<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   OK.  Well, first of all, and as a former high school geography<br/>\n&gt; &gt; teacher,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   let me suggest to you that if she has no interest in geography and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   history facts then why bother with it.? Now, I see in the rest of your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   post that you mention THE STATE and testing.  I&#39;m not sure how to deal<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   with that.  We live here in Texas where testing is not required.  We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   very free here.  The only thing I can think of is just tell your child<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   that THE STATE requires her to know certain things, etc.  I would make<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   it very clear to her that it&#39;s not that important to you.  You just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   her to learn what is interesting and important to her.  But, because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; THE<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   STATE requires this, and this, and that, she must learn it otherwise<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   will have to go back to school.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I have noticed that with many states you have to fall below the 40%<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mark<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   for several years in a row before the state will force you to put your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   child in school.  I would go the unschooling route for as long as you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   can until perhaps the last year when you explain to her the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; consequences<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   and allow her to make her choice.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   My boys are only 7 years old and we live in Texas where the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   homeschooling laws are very lenient, so I can only tell you what I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   do.  I really don&#39;t have any experience with your situation.  What<br/>\n&gt; &gt; state<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   do you live in, by the way?  And what are the specific requirements of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   homeschoolers that the state dictates?  Maybe someone else on this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; list<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   can help you further.

Take what is <br/>\nhelpful from this and disregard the rest.  I&#39;m from PA.  We have to <br/>\ntake standardized tests in grades 3, 5, and 8 AND be evaluated by <br/>\na &quot;qualified&quot; evaluator yearly AND hand in samples of students&#39; work <br/>\nto the school district yearly. (Be glad you don&#39;t live here!)  <br/>\nHowever, I&#39;ve learned a few things from some homeschoolers who have <br/>\nbeen complying longer than I have.  First, we have to take <br/>\nstandardized tests in math and reading only and the school district <br/>\ncan&#39;t legally hold our scores against us.  Perhaps that&#39;s the case in <br/>\nyour state?  Does it matter how well they score?  If the requirement <br/>\nis just that you take the test and not that you score a certain way, <br/>\nthen don&#39;t worry about it.  It seems your law offers the option of <br/>\nhaving a certified teacher evaluate you.  I would probably choose <br/>\nthat option if I were you.  Start hunting down an unschooling <br/>\nfriendly evaluator.  I would see if there&#39;s a statewide homeschool <br/>\nemail list in your state and start asking if any evaluators are <br/>\nunschooling friendly.  There are a few in PA who do distance <br/>\nevaluations for homeschoolers in other parts of PA.  We mail her <br/>\nsamples of the work and then she does the interview (very friendly <br/>\nand informal) with the child over the phone.  So consider that as an <br/>\noption.  Depending on the specifics of your law, even if you can only <br/>\nfind an unschooling friendly evaluator in another part of the state, <br/>\na distance evaluation might work for you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;John & Melissa Morgan&quot; <br/>\n&lt;ourfivepack@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We are in Maine.<br/>\n&gt; Melissa<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: groundhoggirl <br/>\n&gt;   To: Unschooling-dotcom@y... <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, December 06, 2001 9:15 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] OK here is my question :0) How <br/>\n </span></blockquote>do they learn??<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   OK.

My oldest is an 8 year old daughter <br/>\nand my two youngest are boys, ages 4 and 2.  I have only recently <br/>\nmade the switch from extremely relaxed homeschooling to total <br/>\nunschooling and I am absolutely loving it!  I don&#39;t think that you <br/>\nhave to be very creative to unschool.  You just go with the flow.  I <br/>\ncan give you an idea of how my day went today.  Maybe that would help <br/>\nyou a little bit.  All of my children love to go to the library&#39;s <br/>\nstory hour program.  We&#39;re blessed with a very friendly library who <br/>\nwas willing to change their idea of a preschool story hour into a <br/>\nstory hour for children of all ages because of all the homeschooled <br/>\nkids who show up!  My kids like to go places together as a family <br/>\nrather than segregate into age groups, so the story hour situation is <br/>\nperfect for us.  Anyway, we slept in later than we should have so we <br/>\nwere rushing around frantically, dd rushing to get the pets cared for <br/>\nthis am and us barely grabbing a piece of toast before we went out <br/>\nthe door.  My 8 and 2 year old went today.  My 4 yo has always gone <br/>\nwith us but since his dad was home from work today, he wanted to stay <br/>\nhome with him.  Since it is an unusually warm Dec. here in PA, they <br/>\nwent outside in the yard and played baseball and played on the <br/>\nswingset! (phys ed) Dd had a pleasant surprise today because her 2 <br/>\nbest friends showed up for story hour today.  After reading 3 <br/>\nstories, the librarian handed out 3 Christmas coloring pictures. <br/>\n(language arts and art) They colored their pictures and talked, <br/>\naccompanied each other to the bathroom, and walked around the library <br/>\ntalking and giggling like girls like to do.  Dd wanted to borrow <br/>\nMagic School Bus videos, but since they can only be borrowed for 2 <br/>\ndays I told her no  because I wouldn&#39;t be going back into town in the <br/>\nnext two days.  After the library, we went to the grocery store to <br/>\nhand in coloring pictures.  The last time we were there they handed <br/>\nthe kids coloring sheets and said that if they brought them back to <br/>\nthe store colored, they would get free iced tea.  Well, they told us <br/>\nthat we can&#39;t hand them in until Saturday, when they are having <br/>\nchildren&#39;s day--face painting, Santa, etc.  Dd pointed out that if we <br/>\ncome back to the grocery store on Saturday we&#39;ll already be in town <br/>\nand then we could return the Magic School Bus videos.  So, we went <br/>\nback to the library and picked up the videos.  We got home, had a <br/>\nquick lunch of leftover mashed potatoes, and then I got on the <br/>\ncomputer to do some Christmas shopping while the kids watched their <br/>\nmagic school bus vids and played. (Science)When I was finished <br/>\nshopping, I sat down with dd and read some Christmas books she had <br/>\npicked out from the library.  One of the stories was about two <br/>\nchildren who had moved from Colorado with lots of snow to California <br/>\nwith no snow and they were afraid santa wouldn&#39;t be able to go there <br/>\nbecause his sled needed snow. (Note:  Geography!)  Then the boys and <br/>\nI made a batch of Christmas cookies together.  We heated up leftovers <br/>\nfor supper.  After supper, as I was straightening up the living room <br/>\nand came across an I Spy book that ds had wanted to do with me.  I <br/>\ncalled him in and asked him if he would like to do it.  He said yes <br/>\nand we did it for awhile, until we came to a page with a big dominoes <br/>\nset up where dominoes fall and knock a train down some track, which <br/>\nknocks a ball off a shelf which falls on a clothespin which opens and <br/>\nlets a piece of string out which knocks something else over...that <br/>\nkind of thing.  Ds was fascinated with it and we decided to try to <br/>\nbuild something like that ourselves.  Dd joined in and did her own <br/>\ncontraption while ds and I worked on one. (science--physics) Pretty <br/>\nsoon, ds was working pretty much independently and I was just sitting <br/>\nthere keeping him company.  The 2 year old wanted in on the action, <br/>\nthough and kept messing up his brother&#39;s work so I took the two year <br/>\nold in the other room and played with the duplos with him.  Well, <br/>\nbefore long the 4 year old made his way in with us and started <br/>\nbuilding duplos with us. (math) The 4 yo took over the building I had <br/>\nstarted so I sat there sorting the legos from the duplos and putting <br/>\nsome cheap imitation legos that no one plays with in a seperate bag <br/>\nto sell at a yard sale.  At 8:00, dh and I watched survivor in one <br/>\nroom while the kids watched the Charlie Brown Christmas special in <br/>\nanother.  After survivor, the boys and I played with the playmobil <br/>\nnativity set for awhile and then the 4 year old and I read 10 <br/>\nterrible dinosaurs (math) and a magic school bus book (science).  The <br/>\n2 year old listened in here and there but doesn&#39;t sit very long for <br/>\nstories yet.  Then I sent everyone up to brush teeth and get ready <br/>\nfor bed, but dd thought she saw a snake under her radiator.  I <br/>\ncleared everything off the radiator cover (hair stuff and jewelry), <br/>\npulled it out, and got the &quot;snake&quot; (a pony tail holder that had <br/>\nfallen underneath the radiator).  She ended up staying up late <br/>\nbecause as long as it was pulled cleared off, I dusted it off and had <br/>\nher organize all her stuff which had gotten extremely messy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I hope my sample day was a help to you and that I didn&#39;t bore <br/>\nyou with all that!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome stuff my dd likes that maybe yours would too:<br/>\nHas your eight year old ever read the American Girl stuff?  They&#39;re <br/>\ngreat and if she really gets into it, there&#39;s a neat board game that <br/>\nshe might like. Dear America books are great too, although they tend <br/>\nto throw in a few mature themes into them so I always make sure I <br/>\nread them with dd the first time through.  We got a kit through <br/>\nscholastic that has a craft with supplies that you make after you <br/>\nread the book. Dd loves that.  She also likes the Pony Pals and <br/>\nBoxcare children.  We got a Little Women audio tape from the library <br/>\nwhich dd absolutely loves.  We listen to it in the car.  We&#39;re <br/>\nChristians, so some of the books we like to read are Christian too.  <br/>\nDd likes the Ruby Slippers School series, the Mandie series, and we <br/>\nrecently bought an Elsie Dinsmore book that looks interesting.   Does <br/>\nshe like to play board games? Dd loves yatzee, name that country, <br/>\nsorry, Guess who, checkers, and Monopoly.   Does she play with <br/>\ncomputer software?  Dd&#39;s favorites are the Cluefinders 3rd and 4th <br/>\ngrade adventures and the Music Doodle Pad. She really wants Carmen <br/>\nSandiego for Christmas (which she&#39;s getting) Ds likes Ready for Math <br/>\nand Ready to Read with Winnie the Pooh.  She is also excited about <br/>\nsewing some bedding for her doll bunk beds that her dad made for her <br/>\nand she also wants me to help her sew doll clothes for her American <br/>\ngirl dolls this winter.  That is going to be interesting since I&#39;m <br/>\nnot much of a seamstress, but I&#39;ll force myself to stay calm for her <br/>\nsake!  She also loves her pets--a rabbit, cat, and a fish tank which <br/>\nis filled with some things she&#39;s caught in streams and ponds herself--<br/>\nminnows, newts, snails as well as a frog and a fish we bought at a <br/>\npet store.  She wants me to look into breeding bunnies for sale to <br/>\nmedical facilities, which would make for a real interesting house!  <br/>\n(Is saying that going to get me into trouble on this list? lol) She <br/>\nalso likes the Top Secret Adventures kit by Highlights, which covers <br/>\nworld geography.  (Disclaimer:  I don&#39;t encourage her to do it so <br/>\nthat she learns geography.  It is entirely her idea.) She also enjoys <br/>\ncooking and baking and often chooses her own recipe, goes with me to <br/>\nthe store to get ingredients, and cooks/bakes entirely on her own <br/>\n(with me close by to help if I&#39;m needed).  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, maybe your daughter&#39;s interests will be completely <br/>\ndifferent than my daughter&#39;s!  Don&#39;t just do something with her <br/>\nbecause you feel she *should* be interested in it.  Just watch her <br/>\nand see what she likes to do.  It might take awhile before you see <br/>\nsomething creative emerging, but sooner or later, she&#39;ll ask you to <br/>\nplay a game with her, or take her somewhere, even do her hair fancy.  <br/>\nWhatever it is, do it with her, even if it doesn&#39;t &quot;seem&quot; <br/>\neducational.  It might lead to something &quot;educational&quot; but even if it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t, you had a fun time doing something together as mother and <br/>\ndaughter!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila, who had better quit before this email becomes a book! <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;John & Melissa Morgan&quot; <br/>\n&lt;ourfivepack@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We have been homeschooling for a year (officially but actually her <br/>\n </span></blockquote>whole life LOL).

I the past when I worried that low test scores would *matter* (they don&#39;t here), I used practice books such as Scoring High or Gruber&#39;s (found at Borders or B&N). For about 3 weeks prior to the testing date, we&#39;d review some of each chapter and when we&#39;d come across something totally unfamiliar, I&#39;d show her just enough to get by. For example, when they started asking multiplication questions, I explained that multiplication is just lots of addition. She caught on and it didn&#39;t become a problem for dd#1.  DD#2, however, doesn&#39;t have an inkling about multiplication and when she gets to that section of the test, I tell her to do whatever she likes (*knowing* now that in NC, the test results do not matter). <br/>\nSometimes, the practice tests have sparked an interest in something I hadn&#39;t exposed them to before. Other times, it&#39;s just a necessary evil that I explained as a state-mandatory thing we had to do if we want to continue to homeschool. <br/>\nAnother thing about NC is that you don&#39;t have to order the grade-appropriate test. For instance, dd#2 who is 10 and would be considered a 5th grader in the system, takes the 2nd grade test. I&#39;m at liberty to order the test I feel is appropriate for her ability.

Well, first of all, and as a former high school geography <br/>\n&gt; teacher,<br/>\n&gt;   let me suggest to you that if she has no interest in geography and<br/>\n&gt;   history facts then why bother with it.? Now, I see in the rest of your<br/>\n&gt;   post that you mention THE STATE and testing.  I&#39;m not sure how to deal<br/>\n&gt;   with that.  We live here in Texas where testing is not required.  We <br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt;   very free here.  The only thing I can think of is just tell your child<br/>\n&gt;   that THE STATE requires her to know certain things, etc.  I would make<br/>\n&gt;   it very clear to her that it&#39;s not that important to you.  You just <br/>\n&gt; want<br/>\n&gt;   her to learn what is interesting and important to her.  But, because <br/>\n&gt; THE<br/>\n&gt;   STATE requires this, and this, and that, she must learn it otherwise <br/>\n&gt; she<br/>\n&gt;   will have to go back to school.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I have noticed that with many states you have to fall below the 40% <br/>\n&gt; mark<br/>\n&gt;   for several years in a row before the state will force you to put your<br/>\n&gt;   child in school.  I would go the unschooling route for as long as you<br/>\n&gt;   can until perhaps the last year when you explain to her the <br/>\n&gt; consequences<br/>\n&gt;   and allow her to make her choice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   My boys are only 7 years old and we live in Texas where the<br/>\n&gt;   homeschooling laws are very lenient, so I can only tell you what I <br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt;   do.  I really don&#39;t have any experience with your situation.  What <br/>\n&gt; state<br/>\n&gt;   do you live in, by the way?  And what are the specific requirements of<br/>\n&gt;   homeschoolers that the state dictates?  Maybe someone else on this <br/>\n&gt; list<br/>\n&gt;   can help you further.

Well, first of all, and as a former high school geography teacher, <br/>\n  let me suggest to you that if she has no interest in geography and <br/>\n  history facts then why bother with it.? Now, I see in the rest of your <br/>\n  post that you mention THE STATE and testing.  I&#39;m not sure how to deal <br/>\n  with that.  We live here in Texas where testing is not required.  We are <br/>\n  very free here.  The only thing I can think of is just tell your child <br/>\n  that THE STATE requires her to know certain things, etc.  I would make <br/>\n  it very clear to her that it&#39;s not that important to you.  You just want <br/>\n  her to learn what is interesting and important to her.  But, because THE <br/>\n  STATE requires this, and this, and that, she must learn it otherwise she <br/>\n  will have to go back to school.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have noticed that with many states you have to fall below the 40% mark <br/>\n  for several years in a row before the state will force you to put your <br/>\n  child in school.  I would go the unschooling route for as long as you <br/>\n  can until perhaps the last year when you explain to her the consequences <br/>\n  and allow her to make her choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My boys are only 7 years old and we live in Texas where the <br/>\n  homeschooling laws are very lenient, so I can only tell you what I would <br/>\n  do.  I really don&#39;t have any experience with your situation.  What state <br/>\n  do you live in, by the way?  And what are the specific requirements of <br/>\n  homeschoolers that the state dictates?  Maybe someone else on this list <br/>\n  can help you further.
