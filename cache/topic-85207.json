Anyone can come and visit. . . .   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb, I rearranged my Typical Days page just to make a special place for the <br/>\npost that quote&#39;s from.  It was beautiful.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week the reason I was quick to say &quot;This is not a TCS list&quot; is that one <br/>\nof the principles of the TCS people is that they refuse to share information <br/>\nabout their children.  They won&#39;t even tell you age and gender.   For me, <br/>\nthat&#39;s not helpful.  For me, that&#39;s suspect.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir justification for the policy is that it&#39;s disrespectful to the children <br/>\nto share information about them when they&#39;re not old enough to consent (or <br/>\nsomething like that).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my husband shares personal information about me with his friends at work, <br/>\nI don&#39;t mind.  He IS married, and the stories DO involved his life.  I talk <br/>\nabout my husband to my friends, and here.  I don&#39;t tell the most obnoxious <br/>\nthings he ever does or badmouth him, but if he really irritates me, I might come to <br/>\nthe point that I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to mention it.   If he goes crazy and <br/>\ntears up the house, I&#39;ll tell you guys right after I tell the police and the <br/>\ninsurance company.   (Self-inflicted damage to the structure is probably not <br/>\ncovered.)  But I fantasize and I digress into that fantasy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my work.  The time I put into helping other people appreciate natural <br/>\nlearning, and help them be independent of the fear of **curriculum**  <br/>\n(oooooh....) is the work I&#39;m doing at this point in  has her diplomas and degrees in <br/>\na box with Tick Toys and I have something around here in a box or filing <br/>\ncabinet somewhere, what&#39;s important in THIS office (as it were) is that we are <br/>\ndoing well with our children, and working on doing better.
