Music is math - <br/>\nquarter notes, half notes - the different rhythms and patterns. Sewing, <br/>\nart, building, sports, surveys, money-- all math. When we go clothes <br/>\nshopping, I give the kids how much they can spend. They can get one <br/>\noutfit or a bunch, but they have a set amount. Lots of calculating going <br/>\non then!<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to take a class in statistics for social sciences in college <br/>\n(which is what pysch uses) - it was more about understanding what the <br/>\nnumbers were telling you than being able to &quot;do the arithmetic&quot;.  imho, <br/>\nthat&#39;s where math understanding really lies.<br/>\n<br/>\nso I suppose my advice is, if her interest is pyschology, let her pursue <br/>\nthat. She&#39;ll learn the math as she needs it.

She wants to be, <br/>\nprobably an actress, maybe a cartoonist (animator, creator, writer), or <br/>\ntelevision journalist. She probably wants to go to college. I pointed <br/>\nout that she could wait until she&#39;s 16, take algebra at the community <br/>\ncollege. Why waste time now, if she has other things to do, and this, <br/>\nwhich she isn&#39;t really interested in, can wait?

I <br/>\nhave no interest in the math as a MATH, I&#39;ve tried, I really have.  I struggled <br/>\nthrough it in HS and College but I hated every second of it, cried often in <br/>\nfact because the concepts so made no sense to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could GET answers in my head but couldn&#39;t put down the steps on paper which <br/>\nis what every single teacher DEMANDED be done.  I guess if you got it right, <br/>\neven in front of them, in your HEAD it was cheating somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve gotten some of the computer games some on the list recommended.  She <br/>\nlikes them, she plays them.  But she wants that BOOK algebra, that big ugly book <br/>\nthat practically gives me the shakes to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe just thinks I don&#39;t really care about her learning this. <br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently this is my solution, I got one of those very fancy (and expensive) <br/>\ncalculators.  We looked at the very thick booklet that comes with it.  We had <br/>\nto learn how to use the thing, but any algebra problem she can find can be <br/>\nsolved by the calculator thus far.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, she&#39;s thinking that the calculator is cool, way less stress, the <br/>\nsame answer and not remembering things that really make no sense to her right <br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking I&#39;m really happy that there are not all these moments of <br/>\nfrustration, anger and tears over something that I can&#39;t help her conquer.  She has <br/>\nthought about taking an Algebra class but hasn&#39;t really made up her mind yet if <br/>\nthat&#39;s a good thing or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the calculator is the only suggestion that I can offer you, I do <br/>\nunderstand how frustrating this is and how unhappy it can make a child that isn&#39;t <br/>\ngrasping or retaining the concepts.<br/>\n<br/>\nCait would look at something we&#39;d worked on and say &quot;YEAH I get it!&quot; and then <br/>\nproceed, just like your daughter to get all the problems wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe did order a book from Amazon last week that was recommended here about <br/>\nmath, but it&#39;s a story type book not figures and such I believe, we haven&#39;t <br/>\ngotten it yet.  Maybe if she sees it in a way besides figures she might have some <br/>\nawakening that she is looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck to you, I so understand how you feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Algebra...
