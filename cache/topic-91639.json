Forty-two <br/>\nautodidacts gathered in the mountains of Oregon for a week of playing <br/>\nin the sun, brainstorming, sharing knowledge and ideas, and envisioning <br/>\nthe future of self-education. Now, with two years under our belts, we <br/>\nare diving into the third annual Quo Vadis. This year&#39;s gathering takes <br/>\nplace June 20th through June 26th at Camp Lane, just outside of Eugene, <br/>\nOregon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are a self-educator, autodidact, unschooler, homeschooler, life <br/>\nlong learner, or an average everyday Joe who thinks this all sounds <br/>\nfascinating, we would love to get an application from you! Call <br/>\nyourself what you like, but come to Quo Vadis to discuss, practice and <br/>\nexperience education with others who see it as a lifelong process <br/>\nlarger than schooling. We are an adult gathering, but we don&#39;t turn <br/>\nanyone away on the basis of age alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can find out more about Quo Vadis on our web site, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.quovadis-gathering.org\">http://www.quovadis-gathering.org</a> or by emailing our office:  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:info@...\">info@...</a>. The price is only $175 if you apply by <br/>\nApril 10th, so check it out soon!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91638,"nextTopicId":91655}}
