We told him about lots <br/>\nof ways that people view death so that he could kind of find what he needed to <br/>\nbelieve or know to make him comfortable.  It&#39;s a really hard topic and I <br/>\nalmost felt as if he was losing a piece of what makes childhood magical.  He <br/>\nlistened intently and then asked a couple questions, then that was it.  Three days <br/>\nlater, he was in tears and said he didn&#39;t want to die or us either.  We talked <br/>\nsome more and he felt better but I didn&#39;t.  It&#39;s just a hard discussion no <br/>\nmatter where it starts or how it ends.

She already knows that babies are made from a <br/>\nmommy&#39;s egg and daddy&#39;s sperm, and that the sperm gets inside an egg <br/>\nand it makes a baby.  One of the days she was missing her <br/>\ngrandfather I tried the approach, &quot;Remember that babies are made of <br/>\nsome of the mommy and some of the daddy?  And that the genes from <br/>\nmommy and daddy tell the baby what kind of hair to grow, and how <br/>\ntall to get, and how the baby&#39;s voice will be?&quot;  And we traced the <br/>\ngenes back a few generations, from her, to her dad, to her <br/>\ngrandmother, to her great-grandfather, coming of course to the <br/>\nconclusion that even though great-grandpa is dead, part of him is <br/>\nstill alive, because some of his genes helped make her.  It seemed <br/>\nto help her connect, and it might help with the idea of a parent&#39;s <br/>\ndeath.  Also of course making it clear that the child would still be <br/>\ntaken care of. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Sang, I noticed you said your son is saying &quot;I don&#39;t want to <br/>\ndie&quot; not &quot;I don&#39;t think I will die.&quot;  Maybe just validating his <br/>\nfeelings would be enough.  A lot of people don&#39;t want to die.  You <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to change his mind about that.  He might be very clear in <br/>\nunderstanding that he will eventually die, and that so will you.  <br/>\nMorgaine knows that someday we&#39;ll die, but I&#39;ve told her I think I <br/>\nwill be very old, and that she&#39;ll be old, too.  When she asked how <br/>\nold, I said, &quot;Maybe when I&#39;m 95,&quot; and she asked, &quot;How old will I <br/>\nbe?&quot;  I said she&#39;d be 74.  Sometimes she brings those numbers up.  <br/>\nThey seem comforting to her.  She knows it might be sooner or later <br/>\nthan that, but we&#39;ve created a scenario.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKristi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93480,"nextTopicId":93500}}
