Eeek!), we eat, we<br/>\ndisperse to our pursuits, both separate and together.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we go to lessons (my oldest, 6, is currently doing Speech/History<br/>\nCo-Op, Girl Scouts, Ice Skating, is about to start Art lessons and Girl<br/>\nScout Camp, and just finished up her fourth year of dance. My youngest, 3,<br/>\nhas Library story time and just finished up her first year of dance.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThursdays are Park Day. The community pool will open in about 3 weeks, and I<br/>\nexpect we&#39;ll be there nearly every day for at least an hour or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a home business so both my husband and I, and three days a week my<br/>\nhusband&#39;s sister who works for us, are all home with the girls. Some days<br/>\nthey spend the day in the yard being Indians (Native Americans), since our<br/>\nco-op just finished a month on the subject--<br/>\n<br/>\n:::warning, ramble::: Brit, when asked by me if she&#39;d like to do a speech on<br/>\nthe woodland indians like Pocahontas, said, &quot;Can&#39;t I just show them the<br/>\nvideo?&quot; &lt;g&gt; She changed her mind and decided to do the speech -- Brit, when<br/>\nchanging her mind, does so at midnight or later, so at 12:30 a.m. we were<br/>\npouring over books on Pocahontas and her tribe, drawing pictures of bears,<br/>\netc. The week on Plains Indians I found a COOL website on how they used<br/>\nhorses to pull travois, including how to build one suitable for pulling by a<br/>\ntoy horse. I was jazzed. Brit, when shown, yawned and said, &quot;I&#39;m going to<br/>\ngive a speech on our new rats.&quot; Such is the unschooling parent&#39;s life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nAt least I learned a lot about travois. :::now returning you to your<br/>\nregularly scheduled post:::<br/>\n<br/>\n--some days they are all day in the wading pool, some days they spend half<br/>\nthe day watching Cartoon Network and the other half making their own<br/>\nchocolate milk in the kitchen, some days they show up at my desk with a<br/>\nstack of books the size of Kentucky and demand I read to them until I am<br/>\nhoarse, some days Brit teaches Mikey her ABCs, some days we play board games<br/>\n(Yahtzee Junior and the Lego Game are the current favorites), some days Brit<br/>\nteaches the cats new tricks (we are collecting cat training books for her,<br/>\nyou&#39;d probably be shocked to find out how many cat training books exist)...<br/>\n<br/>\n...well, you begin to perceive the problem with answering about average<br/>\ndays.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live.

I am <br/>\ndedicated to the idea of unschooling and my kids choosing what to do <br/>\nwith their time and their learning/doing though :-). I actually think <br/>\nit would be counter-productive to be selfless, one thing that I think <br/>\nis important is that kids also see their parents pursuing their own <br/>\npassions, learning about things they are interested in, taking the <br/>\nsteps to get started in something, learn about it, stick with it when <br/>\nthings get tough. I think they learn through these experiences as <br/>\nwell as through their own. I did my first triathlon <br/>\nin 3 years this weekend. My son got to see me researching <br/>\nequipment (I got new pedals and shoes for my racing bike), he got to <br/>\nsee me training and talking to other people about how best to train, <br/>\nworking hard towards my goal, he got to see me practice my <br/>\ntransitions over and over until I felt I had got them right, and this <br/>\nweekend he got to see me organize all of my gear, create a checklist <br/>\nso I didn&#39;t forget anything, and pack it all up. Then yesterday he <br/>\ngot to see me do the race, how hard it was for me, how exhausted I <br/>\nwas, but how glad I was to have achieved my goal. As I crossed the <br/>\nfinish line, they gave me a &quot;Finisher&#39;s Medal&quot; on a gold band. My son <br/>\ncame running up to me yelling &quot;YOu did it mom! You&#39;re a winner! <br/>\nYou&#39;re a winner!&quot;. And then he asked me if I had won the race and <br/>\nbeat everyone else and when I answered that I hadn&#39;t, that led to a <br/>\nwhole discussion about why to do things if we&#39;re not going to win, <br/>\nwhat it means to challenge oneself, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat all of this boils down to is that in *not* being selfless - in <br/>\nfollowing my own passions - I am showing him what it takes to pursue <br/>\na complex goal and see it from start to finish. Of course, one can&#39;t <br/>\nbe selfish to the point that the children are ignored and unsupported <br/>\nin their own passions, and not getting the time they need with their <br/>\nparents, but I think there&#39;s a healthy balance in there somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would really like to hear what other people do. What does an <br/>\n&gt;average day in your life look like.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an average day here. Some days we go out and do <br/>\nthings with other homeschooling friends or groups, some days we stay <br/>\nhome and do crafts or play in the kiddy pool or play or garden or <br/>\nwhatever, some days we go to thrift stores or garage sales, some days <br/>\nwe go find a creek or pond or mud puddle or a hike or a museum or an <br/>\nactivity, or just go watch the planes take off at the airport. At <br/>\nsome point in every day, I take time to pursue my own passions, <br/>\nwhether that be my photography or my writing, or training for my next <br/>\nrace or flying my airplane. Some of these things I do with the kids <br/>\nalong, sometimes my husband hangs out with them while I do something <br/>\non my own. Occasionally, we will organize a field trip or someone we <br/>\nknow will organize them, and we&#39;ll visit a fire station or something <br/>\nelse interesting. I&#39;m lucky to have found a small group of really <br/>\ncool homeschooling friends to hang out with. We&#39;re planning family <br/>\ncamping trips for the summer, and we&#39;ve taken picnics to the river <br/>\nand to a lake already. I feel blessed to have not only the support <br/>\nbut the friendship of other like-minded people.
