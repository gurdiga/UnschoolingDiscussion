We see things differently, but I&#39;ve gotten more secure <br/>\nabout our family&#39;s choices, and don&#39;t feel that I have to counter everything <br/>\nthese structured homeschoolers do with how WE do it in OUR family. I mean, <br/>\nfor a while I was insecure, doubting our unschooling path, and needed to let <br/>\neveryone know how much better my choices were than theirs. (I was obnoxious <br/>\n*cringe*.) I hope I&#39;ve gotten better at letting my life speak for itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s that 12 step program bit about membership growing by &quot;attraction not <br/>\npromotion&quot;?  <br/>\n <br/>\n       Alaura : My children and I do not fit in with the local homeschoolers <br/>\nbecasue <br/>\n       we are not as tied to curriculum as they are.  I think they see our <br/>\n       wider thinking and tolerance as a threat to their way of life.  I <br/>\n       think that their children give them a hard time when they find out <br/>\n       how my children make their own plans.  I lean heavily towards <br/>\n       unschooling, but we really don&#39;t fit your definition either. <br/>\n<br/>\n*** Alaura, where are you (location, I mean)? You&#39;re on my VaEclectic list, <br/>\ntoo, I see. Maybe we know each other! (Only at group meetings, you think that <br/>\nI&#39;m a structured school-at-homer, and I think you&#39;re a long-time homeschool <br/>\ngroup member who has better things to do than talk to new unschooling people <br/>\n... We really do need that handshake!) No, seriously, we&#39;re probably in <br/>\ndifferent parts of the state. I&#39;m in Richmond -- or close to it.<br/>\n <br/>\n   Alaura: I totally agree with your attitude of respecting children and <br/>\ngiving <br/>\n   them choices.  My children choose to do some textbooks.  We don&#39;t <br/>\n   know any unschoolers in real life so that probably has something to <br/>\n   do with my children&#39;s choice, but maybe not.  They are both very <br/>\n   independent thinkers and they have definite plans for their future.  <br/>\n   If they choose to use textbooks to prepare themselves then I feel <br/>\n   that I should respect and honor those choices. <br/>\n<br/>\n*** Well, sure!! I mean wouldn&#39;t ANY definition of &quot;unschooler&quot; include those <br/>\nwhose kids choose to use textbooks? REQUIRING kids to use textbooks (or <br/>\nbookbooks) would be something not included in my personal definition of <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n <br/>\n      Alaura: Is there really any other place for us?<br/>\n <br/>\n    <br/>\n***There are lots of places to find eclectic homeschoolers, unschoolers, <br/>\nself-directed learners. Finding a place you feel comfortable is the trick, in <br/>\nmy experience. :)<br/>\n <br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":93349703,"authorName":"Lilly","from":"Lilly &lt;hazy_lilly@...&gt;","profile":"hazy_lilly","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Unschooling or not","postDate":"1016109375","msgId":32428,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMzE0MTIzNjE1Ljk1NjM5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MTA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNTMwMWMxY2I1MyQ1ODRmNGE0MCRlYjg5ODUwYUBwYXZpbGlvbj4="},"prevInTopic":32425,"nextInTopic":32429,"prevInTime":32427,"nextInTime":32429,"topicId":32317,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Now i have head everything!LOL closet unschoolers.

I&#39;ve been thinking about why we need the <br/>\nDefinitions. For me, it&#39;s about communication. When another parent at <br/>\na homeschool gathering says, &quot;We unschool&quot;, their use of the word <br/>\nimplies (to me) certain things we might have in common. As the <br/>\nconversation continues, and my new friend begins to talk about rules <br/>\nand structure and subjects, my enthusiastic smile slips, and I see <br/>\nthat her definition of unschooling means something different than my <br/>\ndefinition means. So we lose that &quot;short cut&quot; in communication that <br/>\nThe (Unschooling)Word gives us. But we don&#39;t have to stop <br/>\ncommunicating. We may have to take our conversation *back* a few <br/>\nsteps, clear up some confusion that arose from my assumptions and <br/>\nhers/his, but the doors are still open, neh? :) <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my life, in this kind of situation, it would be convenient if the <br/>\nterm were more black and white for this reason. If there were some <br/>\nkind of Secret Unschoolers Handshake. (&quot;No, you &#39;do math&#39;. I can&#39;t <br/>\nteach you The Handshake.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own unschooling ship is guided by that definition that <br/>\nsays, &quot;Trust children&quot;, and, for me, that includes much more in our <br/>\nlives than traditional &quot;schooling&quot;. (This, for our family, includes <br/>\nunregulated TV, Nintendo, computer, no &quot;rules&quot; or &quot;requirements&quot; <br/>\nimposed from the Parental Authority on High, respect for and trust in <br/>\nothers, etc., etc., blah, blah, blah.:) I find it helpful, <br/>\nexhilarating, to talk with others who see unschooling as I see it. <br/>\nBut I am really &quot;learning to learn&quot; from those who define *their* <br/>\nunschooling differently, to ask *why* they do things a different way. <br/>\nTo listen to their answers. Sometimes this leads to new and <br/>\nstimulating ways to think about things we do in our family. Sometimes <br/>\nit reaffirms my own beliefs in what we&#39;re doing, sometimes it gets me <br/>\nto think about a &quot;better way&quot; ... or a &quot;different&quot; way ... to run it <br/>\npast the ol&#39; internal compass ...<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling or not","postDate":"1015991575","msgId":32335,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDMxMjE5Mzk0Ny4wMjkwZmRkMEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDIwMzEyMTk0Mi5nMkNKZ0FsdDAwMDk1M0BueWNzbXRwMm91dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":32317,"nextInTopic":32346,"prevInTime":32334,"nextInTime":32336,"topicId":32317,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
