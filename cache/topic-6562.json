would work late into the night right next<br/>\nto each other.  now thad is<br/>\nworking for a software company and has set it up for rene&#39; to be a<br/>\nsoftware tester.  rene&#39; can&#39;t wait<br/>\nfor this to happen.  he doesn&#39;t get to go everyday - which i thinks he<br/>\nwould like - but he is excited<br/>\nbecause he will be getting involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nobviously your situation will be unique and i think it will call for<br/>\nsome creativity but i absolutely<br/>\nbelieve anything is possible you just have to find what works for you.<br/>\ni think a lot of people fear<br/>\na lost of identity when their children take a prominent role in their<br/>\nlives hence the high daycare<br/>\nenrollment (nearly all my friends have gone the route of &#39;2 person<br/>\nincome&#39; and most don&#39;t<br/>\nreally need the money as much as they need the verification that they<br/>\nare contributing<br/>\nfinancially and can call themselves something other than &#39;stay at home<br/>\nparents&#39;).  i certainly can<br/>\nunderstand this need.  our society has made it an embarrassment to say<br/>\nyou&#39;re a stay at home<br/>\nparent.  but we must do what it is that makes us confident because it is<br/>\nreally important to our<br/>\nkids that we as parents find our own happiness but in the context of<br/>\nbeing parents.  good luck<br/>\nthough i doubt you need it,  just follow your heart as it appears you<br/>\nhave been and all will be<br/>\nfine (and rough days will be well worth it:)<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin, tx<br/>\n&#39;unity through diversity&#39;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6417,"nextTopicId":6561}}
