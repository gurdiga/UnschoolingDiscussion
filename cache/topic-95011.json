It requires us to throw out the ingrained images<br/>\nfrom our own childhoods, to suppress our knee-jerk reactions to situations<br/>\nand, instead, turn our critical eye inward to examine the underpinning and<br/>\nlegitimacy of our reactions and requests, which requires a whole new set of<br/>\nintrospective skills!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe simple word &quot;no&quot; has a myriad of meanings when we take it apart<br/>\nsituationally. It might mean &quot;I don&#39;t want you to get hurt&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want<br/>\nthat to get broken.&quot; Or, it might really mean &quot;I don&#39;t want to listen to<br/>\nthat&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want to have to clean that up.&quot; The common element to<br/>\nthese situational differences, however, is the primary importance of the<br/>\nparent&#39;s self rather than the child&#39;s.  &quot;No,&quot; then, is really a reflection<br/>\nof the parent&#39;s own needs and desires rather than a direct expression of the<br/>\nchild&#39;s actions. Once we see this connection, we can begin to parent more<br/>\nhonestly-for ourselves and our children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Saying Yes and No","postDate":"1086283921","msgId":95016,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlOS4yMjAzZjBkYy4yZGYwYmE5MUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":95015,"nextInTopic":95110,"prevInTime":95015,"nextInTime":95017,"topicId":95011,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/3/04 10:36:04 AM, julie@bravewriter.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1337681044\">In a message dated 6/3/04 10:36:04 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:julie@...\">julie@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Anyway, perhaps the principle might be that when you feel you need to <br/>\nsay &quot;no,&quot; it helps to give the context for the &quot;no&quot; and also search for <br/>\na possible &quot;yes&quot; solution for the one requesting your involvement. <br/>\nSeems like we need to communicate more than &quot;I will&quot; or &quot;I want to&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;I won&#39;t&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; in order for this to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;What do you think?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds pretty good. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it covers not saying no arbitrarily, and modelling problem solving <br/>\nstrategies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea is to facilitate the kids&#39; busy lives.

We have four other kids who needed me too and I was <br/>\nspending too much time in the car. I asked her thoughts and she told me <br/>\nthat she felt frustrated that she had so few alternatives for rides.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried to brainstorm some ways to make us both happy. She brought the <br/>\nkids to our house a few times instead of going out, she got a few rides <br/>\nand I drove a little less.

It sounds (from comfortably far away, I <br/>\nrealize) like there have been lots of power struggles, both growing <br/>\nup and now with the kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s taken quite a while for me to learn that there&#39;s a third option, <br/>\nrather than just choosing who, the parent or the child, is going to <br/>\nwin the power struggle. Avoiding the power struggle is the best way. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, with a child able and willing to discuss the issue, <br/>\nnegociation and brainstorming is good to avoid fighting about it, or <br/>\nhaving one person feeling put out. Other times, empathizing with <br/>\nfeelings &quot;I know it&#39;s hard to wait for Mommy to finish the dishes&quot; or <br/>\ndistraction and diversion (playing with water, cups and bowls will <br/>\nMommy cleans up)...or whatever you work out with your kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not so much the specific solution for any one situation, it&#39;s <br/>\nseeing that third option. On another list, people were hearing &quot;not <br/>\ncontroling&quot; TV watching as meaning they couldn&#39;t have any influence <br/>\nover what their children did. No, there&#39;s something in between. <br/>\n<br/>\nFlylady&#39;s 15 minute cleaning sessions can work if the kids get into <br/>\nusing timers and knowing their turn is coming. Some kids, some adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nSheila, I again recommend Kurcinka&#39;s &quot;Power Struggles&quot; book. If the <br/>\nkids are used to getting your attention by winning a power struggle, <br/>\nit&#39;s going to be some work to help them understand they aren&#39;t losing <br/>\nif you do something without them for a little while. <br/>\n<br/>\n--aj</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95339,"nextTopicId":95255}}
