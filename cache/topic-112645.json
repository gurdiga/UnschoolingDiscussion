We have a woodburning <br/>\nstove that we heat with, and we ran out of firestarters today.  Our wood is <br/>\nwet from rain, too, and it took me half the day to get a roaring fire going. <br/>\nThese tips are oh-so-appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe reuse all our plastic zipper bags - they&#39;re easy to wash and hang upside <br/>\ndown on a bowl of paintbrushes that are on my windowsill.  An added benefit <br/>\nis that the water from the bags drips into my hot pepper plant sitting <br/>\nthere.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI love that our produce market offers big cardboard boxes in lieu of plastic <br/>\nbags, and they are perfect for storing my recyclables and newspapers, and <br/>\nhave handle holes for easy carrying.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also use cloth napkins instead of paper.  They&#39;re nothing to add to any <br/>\nload of laundry, and since I hate running errands, it&#39;s one less thing to <br/>\nrun out of and go without until I muster the interest in a shopping trip.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 13yo is a great reuser...  he loves to take apart anything he can get his <br/>\nhands on and saves all the parts for someday-inventions.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"recycle/reuse (was kitchens, geography)","postDate":"1141930481","msgId":112645,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgxQTExRjlFLTQ0QjYtNEYxRS1COTU1LTQ5NDREMEZFNkZEMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":112733,"prevInTime":112644,"nextInTime":112646,"topicId":112645,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The clay pens thinking reminded me of this: We reuse LOTS of stuff at our house.

We have our own weird recycling  <br/>\ngoing on.  The paper butter is wrapped in makes great fire-starting  <br/>\nmaterial, and the paper bags from sugar and flour do too.  Paper  <br/>\ntowels that&#39;ve been used to wipe a greasy surface are GREAT for  <br/>\nstarting a fire in the hot tub or fireplace.  The plastic bowls that  <br/>\nfrozen foods come in can be reused lots of times in the microwave.   <br/>\nWhen the kids were little most of their &quot;glasses&quot; were restaurant  <br/>\nglasses (Shoney&#39;s, Black-eyed Pea) from kids&#39; meals.  Plastic milk  <br/>\ncartons are compost containers and plant-pots and water storage, and  <br/>\nfrozen solid in the freezer and taken on outings or car trips in  <br/>\nsummer so there&#39;s ice water to drink as it thaws.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are different levels of &quot;recycling,&quot; and making new cups  <br/>\nout of old ones is a good one!  Making plastic &quot;wood&quot; out of old  <br/>\ngrocery bags is a great one.  Sometimes burning paper trash for fuel  <br/>\n(or starter) seems like a waste, but if the alternative is just  <br/>\nsticking it in a dump, then no... burning can be better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember lots of &quot;recycling&quot; recommendations that were basically  <br/>\njust keeping the trash around as pencil holders and mobiles (&quot;paint  <br/>\ntrash and hang it in the air!&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome stores have big bags and I use those as trash bags.  Savers and  <br/>\nTarget.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust rambling now, on how disposable clay pipes are in comparison to  <br/>\nour everyday disposable stuff.
