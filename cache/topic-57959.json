It&#39;s not that hard<br/>\nto do.  Imagine that you&#39;ve got 8 measure rest on two consecutive lines of<br/>\nyour music.  They&#39;re even about the same place on the line.  Many is the<br/>\ntime I&#39;ve jumped down to the second one and gotten hopelessly lost.  Only<br/>\nthe conductor can straighten that one out, if she&#39;s lucky.  Granted, this<br/>\npretty well never happens with professionals.  But the conductor does a lot<br/>\nmore than keep the group together.  She&#39;s right out front and hears<br/>\nessentially what the audience hears.  If she can&#39;t hear that important<br/>\nlittle bit from the oboes because the first violins are too loud, the<br/>\naudience won&#39;t be able to hear it either.  Of course the violins ought to be<br/>\nlistening for the oboe and play softer if they can&#39;t hear it, but there are<br/>\ntons of other things they have to think about at the same time.  The<br/>\nconductor can motion for less sound, and they&#39;ll see it and respond right<br/>\naway.  *If* they&#39;re pros.  We have some in one of our orchestras who never<br/>\nseem to look up at all.  &lt;g&gt;  The rest of the orchestra has to carry them<br/>\nalong.  And then there&#39;s the fact that an orchestral piece will almost never<br/>\nhave the same tempo all the way through.  There might be a section that&#39;s<br/>\nmeant to go slower.

So first and<br/>\nforemost, the conductor is there to beat time.  Sort of like a silent<br/>\nmetronome.

My quartet (4 people) sits around for hours on end<br/>\nplaying the same pieces and arguing over interpretation.  Imagine that<br/>\nmultiplied by 100. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the conductor, during rehearsals, stops the group, makes comments like,<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;d like a more rich sound at this point&quot;, and &quot;I can&#39;t hear the oboe<br/>\nmelody very well at this spot, so the strings are too loud&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe very best conductors can do that quickly, precicely, and with a minimum<br/>\nof words.
