Questions can be very brief or fairly<br/>\ndetailed, answers can be short or long, but the goal is for them to be<br/>\nreasonably &quot;accessible&quot; to most people. Sometimes the questions may<br/>\nseem too simple to you and other times might go right over your head -<br/>\nthat&#39;s okay, I hope there will be something fun and challenging for<br/>\neverybody.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will not be a place for online discussion, but just for the<br/>\nquestions and answers/explanations to be posted. You can talk about them<br/>\nwith other people, of course, and it might be fun to<br/>\nthink about them as a family, maybe at the dinner table or in the car.<br/>\nPosting will happen whenever I have something to post - could be<br/>\nmultiple questions in one day or only one question in a week, depending<br/>\non what my schedule is like and if other people have sent me questions<br/>\nto use.<br/>\n<br/>\n   To subscribe, please send a blank email to<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ThinkAndLearn-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">ThinkAndLearn-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; or go to the webpage at:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ThinkAndLearn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ThinkAndLearn/</a>&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n   -pam sorooshian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95868,"nextTopicId":95883}}
