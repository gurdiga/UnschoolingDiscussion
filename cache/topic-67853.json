She <br/>\nhas four children and have had other issues like teacher changing a grade <br/>\nfrom an A to an F because the child spoke up to the teacher. Anyway<br/>\n<br/>\nFriday her 11 yr. old daughter came home telling her that because she forgot <br/>\nher school photo&#39;s the teacher was making her write 100 X&#39;s &quot;I will not <br/>\nforget my pictures again.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSo my sister sent a note to the teacher that she will NOT be having her <br/>\ndaughter write this as she feels it is ridiculous.  The teacher has made a <br/>\nfew comments that where not very nice but my sister could not prove it was <br/>\ndirectly at her daughter.<br/>\nToday she finds out the very same teacher made her daughters entire class <br/>\ntake their heavy totes out of their desks and walk around and through the <br/>\nschool three times. Her daughter told her that when she finally put her tote <br/>\ndown her fingers where purple.<br/>\nIsn&#39;t this illegal? Corporal punishment or something?<br/>\nShe went back to the school after hours and complained to another teacher and <br/>\ntold them that here sister Homeschools back east and it is looking way better <br/>\nthan what is happening there. (break through, yes!)<br/>\nNow I am walking a fine line with her because she does feel like she could <br/>\nnot personally HS or if it is even legal. (I have advised her many times it <br/>\nis but it is a big step for those who have never tried it)<br/>\nDoes any one know Utah law? I have looked it up but it looks to be hard to HS <br/>\nthere.<br/>\nAlso if any one wants to send me some comments as to what I can say to guide <br/>\nher please do.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68086,"nextTopicId":68161}}
