Our children also love to see hubby and<br/>\nI snuggle and be affectionate.   They get warm and fuzzy and always want to<br/>\njoin in, so we usually end up piled up on each other..lol.  That was never<br/>\nthe case with my own parents, they have rooms on opposite ends of the house<br/>\nand I&#39;m not sure why they stayed together (maybe didn&#39;t know otherwise).  It<br/>\ntook quite a long time for me to show affection when I started dating and<br/>\nhaving relationships (unhealthy ones, at that), then I met hubby and started<br/>\na family, somehow it became easier.   I guess I wanted the children to see<br/>\nthat relationships opposite of the way I did as a child. tammy\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n-------Original Message-------\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, April 30, 2003 20:56:01\r<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] moms doing what they want\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nFor me, I love my time with the five of us all laying around, out to the<br/>\nmovies, beach , park ect but my dh and I just had this discussion the other<br/>\nday about how refreshed and wonderful we both feel when we spend time alone<br/>\ntogether for a walk even or just a quick night out. It restores my love for<br/>\nhim which is totally different than that of my children. Dont get me wrong<br/>\nmy love for my children is immeasurable but just different. I also feel more<br/>\nconnected to my children when I have taken care of some of my own interests<br/>\nand when I have spent alone time with Gary. I think it shows my girls how<br/>\nimportant and lovely a marriage can be. I look at my inlaws who totally just<br/>\nlive for my dh. They now sleep in seperate beds (have for 20 years) and have<br/>\nno real relationship. My dh feels indebted to them and somehow it is so<br/>\ndifficult for him to leave his mother&#39;s nest because he is leaving her, who<br/>\nlives for him. Anyway, I also think that it is equally important to spend<br/>\nalone time with each individual child once in awhile too.

That&#39;s really what I do.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nAfter seeing that my children have all their needs met, making sure all the\r<br/>\npets have the same, my husband&#39;s needs and taking care of the house, I have\r<br/>\nno time or energy for anything else. And I can honestly say I have no desire\r<br/>\nto get out with friends or have an interest that is solely my own. \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI don&#39;t go out with the girls. Our local homeschool group did a moms night\r<br/>\nout. I never went. I have no desire in the evening to be away from my\r<br/>\nchildren and my husband. Once in awhile I may take a trip to the grocery\r<br/>\nstore or Target without any children but that&#39;s it. My husband and I do\r<br/>\ndinner or a movie alone maybe once or twice at the most in a month. It&#39;s\r<br/>\nactually been about 2 months though since we did that. Everything we pretty\r<br/>\nmuch do is with our children. Everything I pretty much do is with my\r<br/>\nchildren. I never do any kind of tupperware or such parties because that\r<br/>\nwould take me away from my famliy to be with a bunch of women instead. Not\r<br/>\nmy idea of fun. \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nThe only time I have been away from my children is when I had one and was in\r<br/>\nthe hospital, spent the night out briefly 2 Valentines days ago and went to\r<br/>\nChicago for Oprah with Tara. In 9 years, that&#39;s the extent of my away from\r<br/>\nthe children time. I get my grown up talk when my children meet with others\r<br/>\nand I have their moms to talk with. I have this list that gets read when the\r<br/>\nkids are eating or like right now, totally into playing with their hermit\r<br/>\ncrabs. I also stay up until 2 a.m. so I have plenty of time then to read the\r<br/>\nnews and check out this list or anything else on the web I&#39;m searching for.\r<br/>\nI get an occasional magazine to read once in awhile but mostly the new issue\r<br/>\nis out before I&#39;ve read the old one. I do vedge with my husband and a tv\r<br/>\nshow every so often but that&#39;s totally with the children either watching\r<br/>\nwith us or coming back and forth to interact. Movies that we only want to\r<br/>\nwatch alone are done after midnight on the weekends when the kids for the\r<br/>\nmost part are alseep.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI really am happy with the way things are. If our health holds up, my\r<br/>\nhusband and I will have plenty of time when the children won&#39;t want to hang\r<br/>\naround us all the time. We&#39;ll have our alone time then. I see it already\r<br/>\nwith Tara. And if I got hit by a bus tomorrow, I would have no regrets at\r<br/>\nall as to how I parent. \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nMary B \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nYahoo!
