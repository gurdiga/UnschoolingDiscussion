Then Sara came along.<br/>\n     It was much different this time. The day after her six-week<br/>\nimmunisation, I went to get something from a box beside her<br/>\n     bed, and glanced at her. She was blue/grey and her eyes were open and<br/>\nrolled back in her head. She was cold and not<br/>\n     breathing. With my heart in my mouth, I picked her up and shook her.<br/>\nShe gasped. That was the best sound I have ever<br/>\n     heard in my life! She went straight back to sleep, oblivious to my<br/>\nturmoil. At that time I didn�t know that a large number<br/>\n     of babies who are found not breathing die within 24 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n     A few weeks earlier I had felt to pray against cot death, and I really<br/>\nbelieve this is what God used to save her. Needless<br/>\n     to say, I did not sleep well for the next few days. I called the doctor<br/>\nand couldn�t get into see him until the next day,<br/>\n     despite my telling the receptionist that it was so urgent. After<br/>\nchecking, he could not find anything obviously wrong with<br/>\n     her. In the meantime, we hired an apnoea monitor to keep an eye on her.<br/>\nFive days later we got a phone call from the<br/>\n     hospital giving us an appointment in six weeks time! With a lot of<br/>\npersuasion, Michael managed to get them to bring it<br/>\n     forward to three weeks. But the next day she stopped breathing five<br/>\ntimes � one time for about one and a half minutes. I<br/>\n     called the pediatrician and he said to bring her straight into the<br/>\nhospital.<br/>\n<br/>\n     We spent a week at Timaru hospital, while our daughter had myriads of<br/>\ntests. There were no answers and we felt they<br/>\n     considered us hypochondriacs! That was until she stopped breathing in a<br/>\nnurse�s arms. That put the wheels in motion.<br/>\n     We were transferred to Dunedin, three hour�s south, for further tests.<br/>\nTwo weeks later, on Christmas Eve, we were sent<br/>\n     home, knowing nothing, except that she had a slightly abnormal EEG, and<br/>\nreflux. She was put on medication for both and<br/>\n     we were told to come back the following month.<br/>\n<br/>\n     By January, it became evident that the anti-convulsant she was on was<br/>\nnot reducing the number of apnoeas by enough to<br/>\n     warrant their use so we discontinued them. We were still no closer to<br/>\nfinding an answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n     All these trips were starting to stretch the old pockets, so before the<br/>\nnext appointment we moved to Dunedin. We had<br/>\n     only been there one day and she was admitted early as she had an ear<br/>\ninfection which caused a marked increase in her<br/>\n     apnoeas. She was normally having two to three a day.<br/>\n<br/>\n     She did not have her three-month shot until she was five months, due to<br/>\nrepeated ear infections. The night she had her<br/>\n     shots, she stopped breathing five times � a significant increase. I<br/>\ncalled the pediatrician the next morning and he told me<br/>\n     that sometimes the whooping cough vaccine caused that! I wondered why I<br/>\nhad not been warned of this considering her<br/>\n     history. Two months later when she went for her next jab, we omitted<br/>\nthe whooping cough one. She stopped breathing<br/>\n     seven times! This time the pediatrician told me not to worry as one in<br/>\n200 babies does this. And they don�t tell everyone?<br/>\n     I�ve since met several people with the same story. Some of those babies<br/>\nare not alive today.<br/>\n<br/>\n     In a New Zealand book of case studies on SIDS it is interesting to note<br/>\nthat a high proportion of cot deaths happened at<br/>\n     six weeks, three months and six months. Do you see the same pattern<br/>\nthat I do? The other interesting thing is that SIDS is<br/>\n     almost unheard of in those under six weeks. It used to be unheard of in<br/>\nthose under two months, before they changed the<br/>\n     immunisation schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n     I continued researching. Here�s a quote from the book, Vaccination: The<br/>\nHidden Facts by Ian Sinclair. &quot;�We began<br/>\n     recording breathing patterns of babies after vaccination. The results<br/>\nof these recordings were presented to the 2nd<br/>\n     immunisation Conference, held in Canberra, 27-29 May 1991. We<br/>\ndemonstrated that microprocessor records of babies�<br/>\n     breathing after DPT (Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus) injections reveal<br/>\na pattern of flare-ups of Stress-Induced Breathing<br/>\n     closely following the dynamics of adreno-cortical activity in an<br/>\nindividual under stress and as observed and recorded by<br/>\n     Selye.<br/>\n<br/>\n     We also demonstrated that flare-ups of Stress-Induced Breathing in<br/>\nbabies after administration of the DPT vaccine occur<br/>\n     characteristically on certain days even though the amplitude of the<br/>\nflare-ups varies from child to child. For 70 babies who<br/>\n     succumbed to cot death, although babies could die on any day after DPT<br/>\ninjection, there were significantly more deaths<br/>\n     on the days that closely correlated with flare-ups of Stress-Induced<br/>\nBreathing after DPT injections� Yet, babies may<br/>\n     and do die for up to 25 or more days after vaccination, and still as a<br/>\ndirect consequence of the toxic effects of the<br/>\n     vaccines� Our conclusion is that if vaccination were to be suspended,<br/>\nthe cot death rate would be at least halved.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n     Sara is now six years and occasionally she still �forgets� to breathe<br/>\nin her sleep. She still needs to be monitored every<br/>\n     night. Sometimes she stops breathing long enough that she cannot walk<br/>\nproperly the next morning.<br/>\n<br/>\n     CAROLYN LAMB-MILLER<br/>\n<br/>\n     Timaru, New Zealand<br/>\n<br/>\n      Michael and Carolyn are blessed with five children, Alicia 9, Sara 6,<br/>\nRenata 5, Christiana 3 and Bryanna 18 months.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     Advert.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Do you have all the information you need to make informed decisions on<br/>\nchildhood immunisation?

We had<br/>\n     only been there one day and she was admitted early as she had an ear<br/>\ninfection which caused a marked increase in her<br/>\n     apnoeas. She was normally having two to three a day.<br/>\n<br/>\n     She did not have her three-month shot until she was five months, due to<br/>\nrepeated ear infections. The night she had her<br/>\n     shots, she stopped breathing five times � a significant increase. I<br/>\ncalled the pediatrician the next morning and he told me<br/>\n     that sometimes the whooping cough vaccine caused that! I wondered why I<br/>\nhad not been warned of this considering her<br/>\n     history. Two months later when she went for her next jab, we omitted<br/>\nthe whooping cough one. She stopped breathing<br/>\n     seven times! This time the pediatrician told me not to worry as one in<br/>\n200 babies does this. And they don�t tell everyone?<br/>\n     I�ve since met several people with the same story. Some of those babies<br/>\nare not alive today.<br/>\n<br/>\n     In a New Zealand book of case studies on SIDS it is interesting to note<br/>\nthat a high proportion of cot deaths happened at<br/>\n     six weeks, three months and six months. Do you see the same pattern<br/>\nthat I do? The other interesting thing is that SIDS is<br/>\n     almost unheard of in those under six weeks. It used to be unheard of in<br/>\nthose under two months, before they changed the<br/>\n     immunisation schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n     I continued researching. Here�s a quote from the book, Vaccination: The<br/>\nHidden Facts by Ian Sinclair. &quot;�We began<br/>\n     recording breathing patterns of babies after vaccination. The results<br/>\nof these recordings were presented to the 2nd<br/>\n     immunisation Conference, held in Canberra, 27-29 May 1991. We<br/>\ndemonstrated that microprocessor records of babies�<br/>\n     breathing after DPT (Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus) injections reveal<br/>\na pattern of flare-ups of Stress-Induced Breathing<br/>\n     closely following the dynamics of adreno-cortical activity in an<br/>\nindividual under stress and as observed and recorded by<br/>\n     Selye.<br/>\n<br/>\n     We also demonstrated that flare-ups of Stress-Induced Breathing in<br/>\nbabies after administration of the DPT vaccine occur<br/>\n     characteristically on certain days even though the amplitude of the<br/>\nflare-ups varies from child to child. For 70 babies who<br/>\n     succumbed to cot death, although babies could die on any day after DPT<br/>\ninjection, there were significantly more deaths<br/>\n     on the days that closely correlated with flare-ups of Stress-Induced<br/>\nBreathing after DPT injections� Yet, babies may<br/>\n     and do die for up to 25 or more days after vaccination, and still as a<br/>\ndirect consequence of the toxic effects of the<br/>\n     vaccines� Our conclusion is that if vaccination were to be suspended,<br/>\nthe cot death rate would be at least halved.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n     Sara is now six years and occasionally she still �forgets� to breathe<br/>\nin her sleep. She still needs to be monitored every<br/>\n     night. Sometimes she stops breathing long enough that she cannot walk<br/>\nproperly the next morning.<br/>\n<br/>\n     CAROLYN LAMB-MILLER<br/>\n<br/>\n     Timaru, New Zealand<br/>\n<br/>\n      Michael and Carolyn are blessed with five children, Alicia 9, Sara 6,<br/>\nRenata 5, Christiana 3 and Bryanna 18 months.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     Advert.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Do you have all the information you need to make informed decisions on<br/>\nchildhood immunisation?
