THey keep changing the social service agency&#39;s name<br/>\n&gt; (Dept. of Children and Families is what it is called now) so hopefully<br/>\n&gt; people will forget the kids who were just murdered, neglected or hurt,<br/>\n&gt; and keep funding them. On the other hand I have seen testimony by many,<br/>\n&gt; many families whose lives were ruined by social service agencies who<br/>\n&gt; tore them apart, ripped kids out of their parents home for no good<br/>\n&gt; reason by their own opinions and put them into foster homes where they<br/>\n&gt; were raped or abused and neglected.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BUt they change the name of their agency, rather than their<br/>\n&gt; fundamentally flawed premise, that the government by intruding and<br/>\n&gt; degrading the dignity and rights of its people can get them to &quot;act<br/>\n&gt; better&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Debbie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ned Shouts:  There&#39;s a post that anyone can be proud of.
