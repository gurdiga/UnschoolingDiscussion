Why does it cost the school money when the kids are absent? Does their state funding go down or is there some other incentive involved from the state or feds?  I can&#39;t imagine anyone actually paying the money, but then there are a lot of people out there who feel that their mission in life is to support the ps.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI have so many acquaintances who pour all their time and energy into the local schools.  <br/>\nThis is just my experience...the schools here like it if parents help to fundraise, but parents don&#39;t really have any control over curriculum or the way the school is run.  The schools here use parents as a rubber stamp for whatever the schools want.  With all the parental involvement at my local school...and there is a lot...I haven&#39;t seen any changes other than cosmetic. There is a new ugly sign out front of the school, a new mat to wipe off your feet when you go in the door, and other things like that.  My kids and I listen to neighbors talk about all these things.  Why is it none of these parent groups raise money for books and music CDs? <br/>\n <br/>\nI am glad I am not part of this system.<br/>\nDeana<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
