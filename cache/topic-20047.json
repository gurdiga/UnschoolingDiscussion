I think I actually made some head way,<br/>\nbut it isn&#39;t going to hit her like a ton of bricks like it did us, from<br/>\nreading one book.  I printed out what you and others said, including letters<br/>\nfrom another list and I brought them to her to read.  We discussed some of<br/>\nher fears and talked about how the kids will learn what they need to learn<br/>\nand even if they get to college and don&#39;t know how to write a paper at<br/>\nfirst, that they will learn because first year English in college is all<br/>\nabout how to write papers correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I was there, her son was doing his math.  He was finding common<br/>\ndenominators and since he understood how to get the answer it was all busy<br/>\nwork.  I suggested he use a calculator and after asking his mom she said yes<br/>\nit was ok.  Boy, I just saved a whole tree from being scrap paper not to<br/>\nmention the time it was taking him to do the basic math.  I asked her why<br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t let him skip the busywork and she said he likes it.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\nget a chance to ask him if he would do it if he didn&#39;t feel like he had to.<br/>\nMaybe next visit.  I am going to lend her my &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;<br/>\nas soon as I get it back from another person I lent it to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a hard time trying to convince someone to do anything.  I don&#39;t want<br/>\nto hurt people&#39;s feelings because I feel that by promoting what I believe in<br/>\nso strongly, I am criticizing what they are already doing.  I don&#39;t mind<br/>\ngiving examples of what works for us, but my kids are only 4 and 6 and so<br/>\nshe can&#39;t relate with her 12 and 13 year olds.  She did say today, that she<br/>\ncan&#39;t wait to have one kid grown up and on his way so that she can see how<br/>\nit all ends.  She is very afraid of screwing them up for life.  Personally,<br/>\nI think sending them to school could screw them up for life.    I AM making<br/>\nhead way, but the reward is slow in coming.  She is a person who listens to<br/>\nwhat is said and spends a lot of time mulling it over, so there is not<br/>\ninstant gratification for me.  This summer we will spend a lot of time<br/>\ntogether camping and maybe I can talk some more.  She isn&#39;t a big reader so<br/>\nI can&#39;t just give her a bunch of books to read and discuss them with her.<br/>\nWish me luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Valerie [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:valfitz@...\">valfitz@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Monday, April 30, 2001 4:34 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: College bound Question/ For Valerie and<br/>\nAll<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  That&#39;s the same way it hit me.

Maybe you<br/>\n  or all of us have something to learn from these people??? Maybe it&#39;s<br/>\n  just a chance for you to practice convincing others to unschool? Get<br/>\n  really good at it so you can go on the Oprah show with me to promote<br/>\n  my book!!!  (I&#39;m dreaming now)<br/>\n<br/>\n  If her son reads, he&#39;ll do great with essays in college. Reading is<br/>\n  the secret to learning, although for us unschoolers it&#39;s not such a<br/>\n  secret.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hopefully my book will be out soon and she&#39;ll read it and see proof<br/>\n  that it works.

I&#39;m wondering if this is the audience I SHOULD be <br/>\ntargeting. Do I preach to the believers or the nonbelievers? I want <br/>\nthe unbelievers to know that anything is possible with unschooling <br/>\nand college is the one thing that the naysayers doubted in my <br/>\nexperience. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the main points of my book is that parents and children can be <br/>\nfriends.

(Even though she thought public school was a waste of time)  I<br/>\nnever stop telling her about unschooling and how much my children are<br/>\nlearning naturally, but I think she thinks it is just because my children<br/>\nare gifted and wouldn&#39;t necessarily work for her children, though they are<br/>\nvery bright.  Her children hate to sit and do their work and I don&#39;t think<br/>\nshe can see past that fact to the point where if it were NOT forced they<br/>\nwould learn because they would love to and would follow their own interests<br/>\nand that in that course of life, they would learn all they need to.  For me<br/>\nit is so obvious.  I mean after reading about unschooling, I thought, &quot;Well,<br/>\nthat was really obvious, I wonder why I didn&#39;t discover it on my own!  There<br/>\nis no other path that I could take and still be following my heart!&quot;  None<br/>\nthe less, she is very worried about their English.  She is considering<br/>\nhiring a tutor when they begin freshman English.  Her son is an avid reader.<br/>\nThat boy always has a book in his hand.

I was wondering if<br/>\nan of you have any other thoughts or words of wisdom for her to help quell<br/>\nher fears. Esp. those of you who have children who have been through the<br/>\nhigh school years unschooling. Her kids are 7th and 8th grade right now and<br/>\nshe is thinking about giving them high school courses and letting them work<br/>\nthrough them at their own pace, as she has heard that most of jr. high is<br/>\nrepetition of what they learned in grade school.  Her kids are very bright<br/>\nand I don&#39;t think this would be too difficult for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela in Maine.
