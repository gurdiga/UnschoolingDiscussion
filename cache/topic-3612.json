Nothing<br/>\nbrutal &quot;JUST&quot; hand slapping and such.  After #3 and #4 came along,<br/>\nsomething changed in her and things she used to spank for now seemed like<br/>\namusing childlike behavior.  #1 & #2 were also spanked by our father.  I<br/>\nwas about 5 when they divorced, he moved far away out of the picture. <br/>\n#&#39;s 1 & 2 have anger management problems and #2 verbally abuses and<br/>\nneglects his two kids and even after being divorced for 9 years can&#39;t<br/>\ncommunicate civilly with his ex-wife on matters concerning the kids.  # 3<br/>\n& 4, my younger brother and I do not spank our kids and have loving<br/>\nconsiderate relationships with our kids and spouses.  We&#39;re not perfect,<br/>\nbut strive to live kindly with others.  Mere coincidence?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am thankful that I&#39;ve learned about attachment parenting and<br/>\nunschooling while my children were young.  Do you ever think, Faith, that<br/>\nperhaps God has led you to these sites to expose you to another way?<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nWe are shut up in schools and college recitation rooms for ten or fifteen<br/>\nyears,<br/>\nand come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not know a thing.<br/>\nRalph Waldo Emerson<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;And it&#39;s not like before I took this class I didn&#39;t spank, and because<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of this class,  now I<br/>\ndo.  I have always spanked, and I was spanked as a kid (and I turned out<br/>\nfine.) I think that this is one of those issues that will never be won on<br/>\neither side, so there is no point in debating it!!!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>\nTry Juno Web: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3592,"nextTopicId":3613}}
