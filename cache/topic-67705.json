I cut them up into about 2 inch squares and <br/>\nthen put them in the blender. With about 3 times as much water as newspaper. <br/>\nNice gray color.  The ink did not get messy like I thought it might.  Then I <br/>\nadded some old tea leaves. And some seeds, that added a nice country looking <br/>\ntouch. Blended it all up.  I put all that with water into a big plastic tub, <br/>\none of the shallow ones, but large.  Used plastic canvas to get the pulp out <br/>\nwith and pressed a little with some felt, or sponge to get out the excess <br/>\nwater.  Turned it out on a towel to dry.  Using the plastic canvas left it <br/>\nwith a great texture but if you were going to write on it you might look for <br/>\nsomething else.  That was how we did it.  Didn&#39;t get real technical as I <br/>\nwanted it easy so my boys could do it too.  We learned that at last years <br/>\nunschooling conference.  See another reason to come.  You never know what <br/>\nlittle bit of info you will pick up.
