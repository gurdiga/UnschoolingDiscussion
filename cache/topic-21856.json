Medicare patients often aren&#39;t as<br/>\nlucrative for the hospital or doctor as a working person w. good health<br/>\ninsurance.  (Someone please correct me if I have distorted the picture.) <br/>\nIt&#39;s an impersonal kind of financial prejudice.  I don&#39;t know if that makes<br/>\nit any better.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut age prejudice and gender prejudices are real, and not uncommon in our<br/>\nculture.  &quot;Little old ladies&quot; aren&#39;t given much status.<br/>\n<br/>\nA third part is that instutions, such as hospitals and schools, aren&#39;t by<br/>\nnature humane.  (We could have a long philosophical discussion about how to<br/>\nchange them, which would be interesting, but wouldn&#39;t help you much right<br/>\nnow.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom&#39;s pretty fiesty.  I will ask her what she knows about patients<br/>\nrights and elder issues in health care.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there!<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. (My MIL is having surgery today, so you have my sympathy and my<br/>\nempathy, too.  She&#39;s an active-duty military widow, so she still gets<br/>\ntreated in military hospitals.  None of the hospital staff really looks old<br/>\nenough (to me) to be out of high school, but WOW they are unfailingly<br/>\npolite.)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21584,"nextTopicId":21858}}
