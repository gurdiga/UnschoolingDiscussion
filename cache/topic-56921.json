Think of this as hitting you. You need to be firm that this is your<br/>\npersonal boundary and he must not cross it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, like the hitting, there&#39;s reasons behind it. Talk to him about his<br/>\nconcerns. Give him some articles to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut also understand that you&#39;re making a lie of everything you and he<br/>\nbeleived about what people must do to succeed in life. Everything you made<br/>\nhim do, everything he&#39;s convinced himself he must do because it&#39;s what<br/>\npeople have to do, is wrong. He has a right to resent that. He has a right<br/>\nto resent that he&#39;d feel off kilter if he didn&#39;t do what he&#39;s been told he<br/>\nmust do.
