It shows that you&#39;re thinking of <br/>\nlearning as something &quot;done to&quot; someone. That&#39;s different than thinking of <br/>\nlearning as something that someone does. It is a small little word change, <br/>\n&quot;done to&quot; as opposed to &quot;does.&quot;  But it signifies a different perspective. <br/>\nSandra&#39;s point is that it is helpful to unschooling parents to try to think <br/>\nof learning as something we all just do - not &quot;to&quot; ourselves or someone else. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could try reserving &quot;they teach themselves&quot; for times when they <br/>\npurposely set out to systematically learn something. I bought a book and <br/>\npurposely learned guitar chords - you could say I taught myself guitar. But <br/>\nMOST of what kids are learning isn&#39;t that kind of purposeful systematic <br/>\nself-education and to refer to it as them &quot;teaching&quot; themselves makes me <br/>\nthink that that is what they&#39;re doing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2147","postDate":"1026014243","msgId":39029,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQuMjk1ZGI1NjEuMmE1OTE2MjNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39033,"prevInTime":39028,"nextInTime":39030,"topicId":39029,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/6/2002 6:06:26 PM Pacific Daylight Time, ...

She thinks it sounds like we &quot;don&#39;t do anything.&quot; <br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t like me to say &quot;I don&#39;t teach&quot; the kids, either.  I think it is <br/>\nimportant to say it because it is what makes unschooling different than <br/>\nschooling. It is HARD for people to change the way they think about learning <br/>\nand it is EASIER if we are really really clear and precise in the language we <br/>\nuse to talk about what we do (or don&#39;t do).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis whole discussion makes me think about Linda Dobson talking about how she <br/>\ntook her little boy to the pharmacy with her - he&#39;s grown up now and that was <br/>\nway back when homeschooling was unheard of and she was worried about him <br/>\nbeing out during school hours. A nice older woman asked him, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you <br/>\nin school today?&quot; He answered gleefully, but to his mother&#39;s great dismay, <br/>\n&quot;My mom learns me at home!!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI got the third degree from some visitors we have from out of town - old <br/>\nschool chums of my husband&#39;s, mostly the husband. He&#39;d apparently decided we <br/>\nmust be doing this because there is something wrong with the kids, but then <br/>\nhe MET them and couldn&#39;t reconcile the reality with his expectation that they <br/>\nwere &quot;slow&quot; or something &lt;G&gt;. After about 2 hours of grilling and him shaking <br/>\nhis head and basically not believing me that they &quot;just learn because that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat they do&quot;, I got tired of it and resorted to spouting numbers at him -- <br/>\nhow homeschoolers test in the 80th percentile, etc. It was the wimpy way out <br/>\n- but I could tell that THAT would shut him up and that&#39;s all I cared about <br/>\nby that time &lt;G&gt;. He liked the idea of homeschooling - thinks the schools are <br/>\nWAY too lenient and don&#39;t ask enough of the kids - ought to be much more <br/>\nrigorously demanding academically and discipline the kids much more harshly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent some time talking about math with his 12 yo - he is in the gifted <br/>\nmath program at his middle school. He was the absolute EPITOME of what I <br/>\nexpect from accelerated math programs - he had absolutely no ability to do <br/>\nanything with any of the math techniques he had memorized. He could work <br/>\nproblems if they were given to him in the usual textbook out-of-context <br/>\nformat - but couldn&#39;t hold a conversation about them or follow what I was <br/>\ndoing if I used them to explain something. For example, I drew a graph <br/>\nrelating the price of skateboards and the number of skateboards sold by a <br/>\nskate shop and he was confused because I hadn&#39;t used X and Y to label the <br/>\naxes of the graph. When I explained and he got it he said, &quot;So this is sort <br/>\nof like a line graph right?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes, it IS a line graph,&quot; and he said, <br/>\n&quot;I know how to do that, you find the slope.&quot; As if that was the point of it. <br/>\nAbsolutely no comprehension of any meaning of what he was doing.
