He&#39;s 16.   His handwriting <br/>\nis a quick kind of printing where he makes each letter without any regard to <br/>\nthe one before or after it.   He&#39;s more likely to go clockwise than <br/>\ncounter-clockwise when &quot;good&quot; writers (school-trained practitioners of Palmer cursive, I <br/>\nmean--good American writers who were unlucky enough to be stuck with the <br/>\nold-time cursive) would go counter for loops and bowls.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty writes VERY small.   So does Kirby.   I think they got it from writing <br/>\nas small as the printed words they were seeing in books and on gaming cards.   <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo at motor vehicles, you write your signature on paper and they put all the <br/>\nstuff in the machine and it comes out a little smaller in the finished <br/>\nversion.   Marty&#39;s is already nearly too small to read, so the &quot;signature&quot; looks like <br/>\nlittle boxy marks.     Luckily, he&#39;ll be able to reproduce that signature in <br/>\nany situation requiring him to do so, and others wouldn&#39;t be able to begin to <br/>\ndo it, and that&#39;s the purpose of signatures anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107812,"nextTopicId":107828}}
