I Stuck with good<br/>\nliterature and good non-fiction (books about Rome that were for around<br/>\ngrades 6-9 and the Eye Witness books on anything, those types of<br/>\nbook).Leave them around the house where they will see them. Pick them up<br/>\nand let them see you taking an interest in these books.<br/>\nHave a family reading time everyday where you read books aloud to them<br/>\nfor 20 min. After a few weeks you might try to engage them in taking a<br/>\nturn reading aloud from it so you can rest your voice.<br/>\nRent interesting, stimulating movies ....my now 10 yob loved the black<br/>\nand white Julius Caesar (Shakespeare) because it was simple enough for<br/>\nhim to follow and fuelled his interest in ancient Rome. He just<br/>\nyesterday insisted on watching the most current filming of  Les<br/>\nMiserables movie off our satellite dish. He watched it all the way<br/>\nthrough. We got into a great philosophical and moral discussion on why<br/>\nJabert (sp? the cop who pursues Jean Val Jean throughout out the entire<br/>\nmovie), jumped into the river at the end of the movie, letting Val Jean<br/>\nescape.<br/>\nLearning will happen in spite of your not teaching them. Your job is to<br/>\nprovide the opportunities for learning, debate and discussion, and also<br/>\nto teach them how to find the information about what ever it is that is<br/>\ninteresting to them at the time ( how to search on the net, how to use<br/>\nencyclopaedias properly, how to use a dictionary and thesaurus etc.,<br/>\netc..).<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to make sure that the TV viewing is monitored and doesn&#39;t become<br/>\nan obsession around our house. It is a monster that my son deals with<br/>\ndaily. It draws him like flies to honey. He is allowed to watch the<br/>\neducational channels but must have permission to watch other things<br/>\n...otherwise he&#39;ll sit there literally all day in a zombie like trance.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now our house is obsessed with the Olympics and Saturday my 9 yod<br/>\ndecided to start colouring all the flags of the countries&#39; she  she<br/>\nwatched competing (her brother and high schooled sister decided to join<br/>\nher). There was her Art and Geography and history lesson for the day (<br/>\nhistory because there is no USSR flag anymore and she couldn&#39;t find some<br/>\nof the countries in her atlas with the flags listed in it. She had to<br/>\nwatch the TV to figure what the flag was supposed to look like and I had<br/>\nto explain the disassembly of the former Soviet Union).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 9 yod is now knitting for the first time, she is already looking at<br/>\npatterns in a children&#39;s&#39; knitting book. This learning opportunity will<br/>\nteach her to follow written directions, plan out a project and estimate<br/>\nmaterials as well as teach her some mathematical skills that are<br/>\nrequired to achieve the end result (knitters and crocheters will<br/>\nunderstand what I mean, mk1&#39;s and yo&#39;s and decreases etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be too frightened of the process and have faith in your children.<br/>\nIt may take a year or more to see significant results (that&#39;s how long<br/>\nit took me and I am ever so glad I waited, and had faith in my kids<br/>\nabilities to learn on their own).<br/>\nChildren are never taught in school either they are just given<br/>\ninformation and are given the opportunity to learn the material, but<br/>\nit&#39;s in a noisy, crowded environment without the benefit of individual<br/>\nattention. It&#39;s up to the child to learn from the instructions, ideas<br/>\nand the materials provided by a teacher. Nobody can force a child to<br/>\nlearn anything, they have to be willing/wanting  to learn it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie/Buzz<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   <br/>\n The Klement Family       &quot;Education is what survives when <br/>\n Darryl, Debbie,           what has been learned has been <br/>\n Kathleen, Nathan &        forgotten&quot;<br/>\n Samantha                  B.F.
