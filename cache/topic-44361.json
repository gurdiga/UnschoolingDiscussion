When I tried to resist putting Chris on Concerta they<br/>\n  said that my refusal was tantamount to parental neglect and that they would<br/>\n  remove him from my care for neglect if I did not medicate. That will not<br/>\n  change with bringing Chris home. Michael and I are planning to relocate<br/>\n  outside of SC (as far outside as I can get) just as soon as we can afford to<br/>\n  do so. Then I will have the legal freedom to choose whether or not to<br/>\n  medicate without fear of having my child taken from me. Until then I<br/>\n  medicate. I am in the process of making the psychiatrists re-evaluate his<br/>\n  medication (Chris has another appointment in three weeks.) But this too will<br/>\n  be a long process.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unlike many parents with children who were &quot;diagnosed&quot; with ADHD, I do<br/>\n  believe that my child is having a medical problem. He hears and sees things<br/>\n  that we do not, talks to himself all the time, and has... to one degree or<br/>\n  another...many of the behavioral problems that the teachers claim. Some<br/>\n  children do need medication to function, even in an unschooled environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The problem is that children end up getting hung with the ADHD label if<br/>\n  their behavior falls outside of the accepted norm. The fact is that some<br/>\n  ADHD kids are actually suffering from other problems (juvenile bipolar<br/>\n  disorder, allergies to foods and environmental factors, allergies to<br/>\n  vaccines, early onset pschzo-affective disorder, Touretts, etc)  and the<br/>\n  teachers know that it will be easier to medicate and zombie these kids than<br/>\n  to try and convince someone to examine their behaviors and treat them<br/>\n  accurately.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is far easier for them to do their job, to push these kids into the<br/>\n  cookie cutter mold of the diploma factory, than to do the right thing,<br/>\n  mainly to get them proper medical care and real diagnosises that are based<br/>\n  upon a doctor&#39;s careful and caring examination, testing and observation.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am not anti medication when it is actually necessary. I am vehmently<br/>\n  opposed to anyone medicating a child who does not need it. Further I really<br/>\n  hate when it is assumed that any parent who chooses to medicate is harming<br/>\n  their child just because it is unpopular in the opinion of your peers to<br/>\n  medicate. Whether they were coerced or they actually chose to medicate the<br/>\n  child it is insensitive to insinuate that their decision is wrong because it<br/>\n  has been wrong for others.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t like having to medicate my child. It&#39;s theraputic benefit is minimal<br/>\n  at best. But I conceed that there is a problem and I am on a mission to find<br/>\n  out what that problem is so that he may live the most normal, positive,<br/>\n  loving existance possible. I love my child. So I keep looking and I try new<br/>\n  medications because refusing to do so would be neglecting him, no matter how<br/>\n  DSS sees it. Now, I&#39;ll jump down and give someone else a chance on the soap<br/>\n  box.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Brightest Blessings,<br/>\n             Virginia<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Religion is what we do so that others will think well of us.
