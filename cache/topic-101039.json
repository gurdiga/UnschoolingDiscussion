There was some conversation about when a child wants curriculum and<br/>\ntextbooks to use, despite the mother&#39;s desire to Unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last thing that the mother who was pseudo-unschooling wrote was that she<br/>\nhad heard that a lot of definitions of unschooling as neglect and then &quot;I&#39;ll<br/>\nsay no more.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI chose to let it go, and allow the nasty dig clearly aimed at me to stand<br/>\nin the light of everyone&#39;s intelligent scrutiny, without me pointing at it<br/>\nand taking it personally (even though I think it was meant that way.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I did IRL mention to some of my friends from the group, if this is<br/>\nwhat you believe Unschooling is why, in the name of all logic, would you<br/>\nwish to appropriate the name to yourself?<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

If you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1242400666\">What makes you feel lead to go in that direction?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of your questions are not easy to answer because they don&#39;t make sense in unschooling terms.  If you believe that people learn what they need to know -- then you believe that your children (as people) will learn what they need to know, and that what they have learned is what they needed to know.  If they didn&#39;t learn it, they didn&#39;t need to know it (yet).  I think of that as all inherent in defining what learning/knowing/unschooling means.   But is all circulare BECAUSE it is all in the definitions. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if your questions are actually closer to these: (1) Will my children wish later that I had made them learn something else now?  (2) Is there a &quot;window&quot; where if my children do not learn something now, they will be unable to learn it later (due to lack of ability or desire or time?) <br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer to those questions, IMO, is (1) who knows? but is it worth the damage to your relationship by forcing them now? and (2) No - they can always learn what they need to know when they are motivated by needing to know it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was not unschooled as a child - but with very few exceptions, the things that I learned as a child and retained and used, were all things that I learned outside of school.  (I was a &quot;great&quot; student in school terms (all As) - but I learned things for the tests and promptly forgot them.)  So, I think I can truthfully say that my actual current knowledge was almost entirely acquired by unschooling.  And I&#39;d probably know a lot more if school hadn&#39;t wasted so much of my time! <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Bill and Tia Banks <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, November 12, 2004 11:10 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] new unschooler question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi, We are new to unschooling but feel lead to go in that dirrection.

Why bother when you&#39;d have to work so very hard to see any &#39;progress&#39; or <br/>\njoy in your life?  No wonder he&#39;s so unhappy and angry.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a story about a kid who&#39;s in school, so anyone who&#39;s pressed for time <br/>\nshould just skip it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty is working with a boy who&#39;s 18 and went to school.  I know both his <br/>\nparents.  They&#39;re not very nice to him, and he&#39;s been angry and bullying since I <br/>\nmet him, when he was 11 or 12.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty invited him over tonight, for  a Halo party that&#39;s actually Kirby&#39;s <br/>\nparty.  I said, &quot;Okay, Marty, but you&#39;re responsible for his behavior.  If he <br/>\nstarts getting loud and bullying, get him to stop.  You can use me as a bad guy <br/>\nif you want to say, &#39;You need to chill or my mom will throw you out.&#39;&quot;  Marty <br/>\ndidn&#39;t give me a quizzical look.  He knew EXACTLY what I was saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis mom told me last spring that as soon as the boy was 18 (he&#39;s an only <br/>\nchild, she&#39;s his stepmother, but has been there most of his life) he was out.   I <br/>\ntold her we weren&#39;t throwing Kirby out.   We do have more room and more money <br/>\nthan they do, but having him there won&#39;t kill them.   So he&#39;s 18 and still <br/>\nthere, but this job they have is okay for Marty for spending money but not so <br/>\ngreat for the other kid if he really wants independence.  He&#39;s going to buy a car <br/>\nfrom his aunt with the money, and then I guess he can get a better job.  <br/>\nUsually Marty gives him a ride.  He used to take the bus.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I drove Marty and picked the kid up.  He said &quot;I&#39;m all cut up from <br/>\nmy bed.  I have lots of little cuts on me because a spring poked through.&quot;    <br/>\nSHEESH!!!  He&#39;s sleeping on a box spring and not a mattress, and he&#39;s not a <br/>\nsmall/light person.   His parents could honestly afford a mattress from a thrift <br/>\nstore, or just ask around all our friends and find one.  But then again, this <br/>\nguy&#39;s smart enough to have done that himself, or to put some padding between <br/>\nhim and the springs.  Each person in that family is increasingly beat down and <br/>\nnegative.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo on one hand I&#39;m sympathetic and with his parent would do more to make his <br/>\nlife comfortable.

I have come across many that believed that unschooling is simply not using a curriculm. But I have found that this is not true! True Unschooling encompasses much more than that. This takes a bit more learning, especially if one has not really experienced any other models  than what they are surrounded by.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the plastic toys and video games and such - this comes from a personal preference of the parent (or hang-up). I have found it difficult when my son purchases(or I am purhasing for him) those combat/army figures. It bugs me, however I have had to examine that he is not me, that he has his own likes and dislikes. To make him feel bad for this because it&#39;s not my thing, is like belittling his father for watching football - when it bores the tar out of me ;-) My associations with these figures and military stuff (that look so real!) come from the &quot;real war&quot; that I am concerned about.

It is so hard when no one in our family agrees or in our community.  I am wondering how you make sure they learn the basics in order to thrive as adults.  I am worried that they will be behind when they get older and it would all be my fault :o(<br/>\n<br/>\nMath, english, science, history, etc.  Things that they need to be succesful in the world as adults, making a living.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs anyone an adult who was unschooled as a child?<br/>\n<br/>\nI just feel so worried at times and want to enroll them in PS, to make sure they get some education.

What about kids not <br/>\nlike that.&quot;  I said that from what I&#39;ve  seen,  most of those  &quot;problems&quot; go <br/>\naway when you remove  school.   I told her all kids shine when they unschool.  <br/>\n:)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nGood answer.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m dealing with this too. I spoke with a friend yesterday. Strict Catholic  <br/>\nDictator. And she likes it that way.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe & her husband adopted their two great-nephews, now 13 & 12.  They were <br/>\nhorribly abused (cigarette burns on their scalps, etc.) They were  taken from <br/>\ntheir bio parents at four & three, I believe (I could be off by a  year either <br/>\nway). Bio-parents imprisoned for abuse and drugs.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe younger boy is fine: he follows the rules (of which there are MANY!),  so <br/>\nhe&#39;s no problem. The older boy is totally out of control. He was expelled  <br/>\nlast week. He has NO privileges: they&#39;ve all been removed. He goes to work with  <br/>\nhis father and sits at the office all day unless his dad tells him to help <br/>\nthe  janitor empty the garbage.<br/>\n <br/>\nThey said they could pinpoint when he went off: last September when his  <br/>\ngreat-grandmother died. She would allow him to walk to her house, eat oreos,  <br/>\ndrink cokes, and watch cartoons all day----in other words (IMO), the only one  who <br/>\nshowed him unconditional love.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s very sad. He&#39;s a handsome, smart boy with a great smile.  Charming.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy friend said that they &#39;tried&#39; it my way: they gave him his privileges  <br/>\nwhen he was good----but that didn&#39;t last long.  It&#39;s hard to explain that  THAT <br/>\nwasn&#39;t what I&#39;m talking about----that he should get these things because he  is <br/>\nWho He Is----NOT because he followed the rules.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow, his food is tightly monitored (no cokes or oreos---with cokes in the  <br/>\nhouse, one night he &#39;stole&#39; four in the middle of the night----so no more cokes  <br/>\nallowed), no tv, no games, no swimming, no NOTHING! He&#39;s not allowed to do  <br/>\nanything that he likes. <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd yet they wonder why he&#39;s difficult.<br/>\n <br/>\nHer comment to me was, &quot;But Cameron has always been so easy. This one had  <br/>\nlousy parents---it&#39;s all genetic.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nWe are polar opposites. But I could see him THRIVE in my house. Absolutely  <br/>\nthrive.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nI haven&#39;t seen him in four years. I might be seeing him in a few weeks. I  <br/>\nhope we can spend some time together. His young life sucked. But now he&#39;s having <br/>\n the life sucked OUT of him.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly, so sad<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101136,"nextTopicId":100848}}
