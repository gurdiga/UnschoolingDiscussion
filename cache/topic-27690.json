Should she simply follow her taste buds,<br/>\nshe could still get into trouble.....even a few days on a diet that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork for her could land her in the hospital with a kidney infection.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso,  alcoholics and substance abusers crave their addictive item......many<br/>\nneed the intervention of loved ones to turn themselves around.  High sugar<br/>\nconsumption causes fluctuations in blood sugar that cause people to crave<br/>\nsugar.  The body can fool you.  Some people seem to have a better sense of<br/>\ntheir body and its needs than others...i.e.,  one of my children has always<br/>\ntaken a nap when she&#39;s tired of her own volition,  the others fight their<br/>\ntiredness through tantrums and grumbling...resisting their body&#39;s needs;<br/>\nthey require something from the adults in their lives to enable/encourage<br/>\nthem in discerning their bodies needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at it this way:<br/>\nYou believe your child knows what she needs to eat everyday and you let<br/>\nher choose what and how much.  She is fine and healthy but chooses to eat<br/>\nthings you detest - say Peanut butter and Garlic sandwiches.  All is well<br/>\nthough and you can trust her to make her own choices because they are not<br/>\nharming her and you have disassociated the taste from the health issue.<br/>\nNow, suppose you daughter decides to eat nothing but celery.  All celery<br/>\never day.  Absolutely nothing else.  She has lost loads of weight and is<br/>\nunhealthy.  Can you still let her make her own choices regarding food?<br/>\nWhen exactly is the right time to step in and do something?<br/>\nThe same holds true for every parenting issue.  We need to learn and<br/>\nobserve and figure out when the right time to step in is.  But no one can<br/>\nsay that there is NEVER a time to step in with any child.  I do think<br/>\nmany people step in on too many issues because they can&#39;t disassociate<br/>\ntheir own wants and needs from the childs wants and needs.  But that does<br/>\nnot mean that it is NEVER right to step in.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; obviously understand that this is what is better for your<br/>\n&gt; daughter.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just like another person would understanding that limiting or not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would best suit the child&#39;s needs. It&#39;s all a matter of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; individualism.  Bonnie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But you&#39;re setting up a Catch-22 here. If I say I know best and so I<br/>\n&gt; make<br/>\n&gt; her do things or not do things, then you&#39;re right. If I say I think<br/>\n&gt; she<br/>\n&gt; knows best, then you say I must know best so if I think that then I<br/>\n&gt; must<br/>\n&gt; be right, and you&#39;re right again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My head spins, but maybe it&#39;s easier to take oit away from the<br/>\n&gt; personal,<br/>\n&gt; and say I think the child knows best... </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27661,"nextTopicId":27698}}
