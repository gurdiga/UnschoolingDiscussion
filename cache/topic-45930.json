Nowhere in <br/>\n  any of that have I ever heard &quot;lazy&quot; in any good connotation except &quot;lazy <br/>\n  river&quot; or &quot;lazy day,&quot; and uses of lazy rivers and lazy days go against much <br/>\n  of what is prized in our culture, which is hard work and diligence.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Laziness (or vacation time or relaxation or other words like that) should be prized as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;Don&#39;t you think there are words out there that mean totally different <br/>\n  things to different people? Why shouldn&#39;t people have the freedom to look at <br/>\n  words any way they want to? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Words are for communication, and you communicate real things when you write, <br/>\n  when you speak, and when you address or refer to people.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If I decide to call my couch a dog and ask people if they want to sit on my <br/>\n  dog, I won&#39;t be communicating well at all.  Even if I tell them all that I <br/>\n  really think dog and couch are the same thing, they won&#39;t want to go along <br/>\n  with me about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Hmmm. My kids love to make up names for things and call them by it. I encourage. We watch a box (tv), feed the furballs (cats), watch the sky cry (rain), etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;I find it really odd that in a group of unschoolers, that it is not <br/>\n  understandable that people may think of different words and phrases <br/>\n  differently. It&#39;s ok for kids but not adults? Or it shouldn&#39;t be done at all? <br/>\n  Other languages have different pronunciations to lend different tones to <br/>\n  words, but we don&#39;t. In the absence of that, it should make perfect sense <br/>\n  that the words hold different meanings for different people. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  That was nonsense.  And by &quot;nonsense,&quot; I mean it wasn&#39;t sensible <br/>\n  communication. It was noise made to cover over a disregard for and lack of <br/>\n  knowledge about language.<br/>\n  ** Not hardly. I wouldn&#39;t waste my time or other&#39;s time. I look at words as things to play with, tools. Not the absolute, be all and end all to everything. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you really want to say LA LA LA LA LA I AM NOT LISTENING<br/>\n  about people&#39;s suggestions about not calling your child lazy, then just <br/>\n  ignore it quietly, okay?<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Do not doubt that I would, if that is what I really wanted to say. <br/>\n<br/>\n  You will not write enough words to get people here to say &quot;OH!!!!!  THAT&#39;s <br/>\n  what you meant!!  Then we agree that it will not harm your child in any way <br/>\n  for his mother to tell him and others that he is lacking in energy, <br/>\n  curiosity, and the natural desire to do and learn.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  You won&#39;t win this one.<br/>\n  Even if you were to go far away and never think of this again (which isn&#39;t <br/>\n  likely to happen), name-calling is still harmful.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** I wasn&#39;t aware this was a battle to be won. There is no across-the-board right or wrong. It&#39;s our choice as a family (not just my choice) and that&#39;s as it should be. And, yes, name-calling is harmful, and I would never do that. <br/>\n  Myranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

THAT&#39;s <br/>\n  what you meant!!
