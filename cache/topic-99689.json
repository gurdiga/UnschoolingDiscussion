I just sent you a message<br/>\noff-list about meeting up if you&#39;d like and the VHEA Conference that was<br/>\nin the Science Museum of Virginia in Richmond.  It&#39;s not an unschooling<br/>\nconference per se, but I consider it to be unschooler-friendly.  VHEA is<br/>\nan inclusive group that focuses strictly on homeschooling issues and is<br/>\nnot tied to any religious or political philosophy.  www.vhea.org<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vhea.org/\">http://www.vhea.org/</a>&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\nTTFN!<br/>\n <br/>\n~ Alicia     <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196977305,"authorName":"AtticOfThought@aol.com","from":"AtticOfThought@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] mini-conferences","postDate":"1096343920","msgId":99924,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDViLjVhMjgzZTllLjJlOGEzYjcwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":99736,"nextInTopic":99963,"prevInTime":99923,"nextInTime":99925,"topicId":99689,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have to make this e-mail quick, I heard talk of trying to get a mini convention going around the DC area, I m a new home schooler, and really dont know much","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-667121668\">I have to make this e-mail quick,<br/>\nI heard talk of trying to get a mini convention going around the DC area, I&#39;m <br/>\na new home schooler, and really dont know much about the people or events <br/>\naround here, but i live in Fredericksburg witch is close, if theres any thing i <br/>\ncan do to help just let me know<br/>\n~liz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] mini-conferences","postDate":"1095786919","msgId":99736,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0OS4zNDJkODhlYi4yZTgxYmJhN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":99689,"nextInTopic":99924,"prevInTime":99735,"nextInTime":99737,"topicId":99689,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/19/2004 9:04:20 AM Eastern Daylight Time, Earthmomma67@aol.com writes: Being  the recovering controller that I am, and not wanting to wait","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-301016404\">In a message dated 9/19/2004 9:04:20 AM Eastern Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Earthmomma67@...\">Earthmomma67@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing  the recovering controller that I am, and not wanting to wait until <br/>\n2054 <br/>\nto  have a conference here, I&#39;m planning a one day mini-conf in the DC area  <br/>\nfor the late spring.
