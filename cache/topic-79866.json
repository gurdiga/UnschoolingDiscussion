After a few of these comments, she thought about it more and decided it was really more of an &quot;introduction,&quot; so she began to add to it, to make it meatier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t read it and don&#39;t know the title or what its about or anything else. I think their ownership of all this writing they do is so awesome that I&#39;m very very careful about stepping in - I read when they offer it to me - sometimes they send me links. But if I purposely got into it - even just to observe - it would feel like parents hovering over younger children who are just trying to play pretend - making mudpies and playing house or whatever. As much fun as it is for some of us adults to watch kids play - it doesn&#39;t seem entirely &quot;right&quot; to me - it feels like we&#39;re using them for our entertainment (which is okay in small doses - we LOVE them and enjoy them, etc., but I also think we have to leave them alone and show we trust them to grow outside our constant watchfulness.  I mean - its a fine line I guess - and we have to use our own sense of how things are going in their lives and not be so out of touch that we don&#39;t even KNOW what their lives are like, of course. But I&#39;m in no danger of that and yet, I think the fact that the writing they do is so totally THEIRS - that it has absolutely NOTHING to do with writing to satisfy an adult - is an extra extra special and wonderful gift I can give them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far it has panned out in terms of my kids LOVING to write - and becoming extremely proficient writers. But, truth is, that&#39;s not what motivated me to let their writing alone, not to even ask to see it, to be super cautious about even remotely seeming to be intruding. I just did it because it felt right - writing is private - asking to read something is like asking someone to tell you what she is thinking. They know I read - they know they can share what they write with me. I don&#39;t need to ask. And, sometimes they do - something they think I will like. Mostly they don&#39;t see their writing as the kind of thing I&#39;m usually into - and it doesn&#39;t occur to them that I&#39;d be interested just to observe how well they write - they aren&#39;t writing as an exercise, they aren&#39;t writing with the purpose of learning to write. They don&#39;t think of it that way and don&#39;t realize that I MIGHT think of it that way.  I think this is so cool. One of the things I feel like I did RIGHT in my journey of parenting/unschooling! <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the porno thing - I&#39;m beginning to think that kids are going to have to learn to delete and ignore -- they just are stuck with that in their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Exciting News about the Boston Conference (But I ...","postDate":"1062717620","msgId":79907,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNGNTdDOEI0LjMwODAxMDZAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDFkMi4xMDY1OTgxZi4yYzg4YTEwOEBhb2wuY29tPiA8MDBhZjAxYzM3MmYxJDJlZmUyYzAwJGJhZWFmZWE5QFNFWU1PVVJCVVRUUz4="},"prevInTopic":79896,"nextInTopic":79910,"prevInTime":79906,"nextInTime":79908,"topicId":79866,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** She found a website called Fanfiction.net where people write fictional stories using real cartoon characters and they critique each other s stories.** Until","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-114457995\">** She found a website called Fanfiction.net where people write<br/>\nfictional stories using real cartoon characters and they critique each<br/>\nother&#39;s stories.**<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil a few months ago, many sections of Fanfiction.net had X-rated (or <br/>\nNC-17-rated) stories.
