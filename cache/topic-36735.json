That&#39;s where my teenaged boys are learning to write--in <br/>\ninstant messages, role playing games and reading and answering questions <br/>\nabout video games.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;How many of you have unschooled through high school?  I&#39;d like to know how<br/>\nyou got across the higher maths and sciences...&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re in the process.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe ideas and concepts are peppered through their regular lives.  We&#39;re not <br/>\ndoing &quot;courses,&quot; but as things come up in discussions or in movies or TV or <br/>\nwhatever, bits and pieces are fitting together.  They have large but <br/>\nscattered amounts of scientific vocabulary.  When and if they do &quot;study&quot; one <br/>\nfield in earnest, it will be a matter of fitting the concepts they already <br/>\nhave into the formal framework, and learning some more (not ALL of it, not in <br/>\nany area I can think of).<br/>\n<br/>\nToday Holly asked me to come and watch something on PBS with her.  It was a <br/>\npart of a series on the brain, dealing with language, and how language is <br/>\nrelearned after a certain kind of surgery (removing the left hemisphere).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was an eight year old being shown as an example of dyslexia.  Their <br/>\nproof that he had a serious reading problem was that he was failing to sound <br/>\nout long words.  He was eight.  Some of the words were:<br/>\ntherapeutic<br/>\nmasculine<br/>\nscientific<br/>\ninventive<br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;m sure about the first two; Holly said she saw the other two, and so I <br/>\ndon&#39;t swear to them, but they&#39;re likely and of the same sort--I just didn&#39;t <br/>\nwrite fast enough.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are not words most eight year olds use.  Words they know, they can <br/>\nrecognize or figure out.  Not being able to pronounce a word you&#39;ve never <br/>\nseen or heard happens to all KINDS of people, at any age.  <br/>\nYosemite<br/>\nPersephone<br/>\nHermione (the most common recent...)<br/>\n<br/>\nBy any normal clues or rules, those will NOT be pronounced &quot;correctly&quot; by <br/>\nanyone who hasn&#39;t heard them pronounced.  Same with many surnames--the <br/>\npronunciation is passed on verbally, and can&#39;t be deduced by the written word.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway, that was something Holly wanted to share with me.  We sat for <br/>\nnearly an hour, discussing parts of it during and after, sharing examples she <br/>\nknew from some toddlers she has spent a lot of time with, me telling her <br/>\nstories of her language acquisition, and her brothers&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the show said &quot;Reading never just happens.&quot;  I looked at Holly and she <br/>\nkinda smirked.  She knew something scientists don&#39;t know. <br/>\n<br/>\nThose folks will never see reading just happen, because they won&#39;t leave it <br/>\nalone long enough for it to &quot;just&quot; (over the course of a few years) happen.  <br/>\nHuman speech doesn&#39;t &quot;just happen&quot; either--it takes a few years, but over the <br/>\ncourse of a few years, with supportive feedback and ample opportunity and <br/>\nexample, it happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36734,"nextTopicId":36736}}
