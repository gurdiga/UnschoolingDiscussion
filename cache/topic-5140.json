I&#39;m Marcie, new to the list, and this is also our first <br/>\nyear of home schooling.  My soon-to-be-11 year old has had days where she got <br/>\na notebook out and planned out her day included bathroom trips.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are taking the plunge into unschooling and I am really enjoying the list <br/>\nand the message boards and have read some stories that sound so much like our <br/>\nown.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur girls are nearly 11, 6 and 2, and my oldest had a rotten year last year <br/>\nin public school.  We let them finish the year out, but let them know in the <br/>\nspring that we were going to begin home schooling in August.  My oldest was <br/>\nangry and upset; she is now the president of the home schooling cheerleading <br/>\nsquad . . .   She thought she needed structure to learn anything.  We&#39;ve <br/>\nfound out that that&#39;s just what she doesn&#39;t need.  My 6 year old is a born <br/>\nunschooler if there ever was one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, I have been the biggest problem in all of this.  I&#39;m a very <br/>\nstructured, &quot;student&quot; type who likes things to be organized.  In my evolution <br/>\nas a home schooling parent the last few months, I finally came to the <br/>\nconclusion that I needed to be more courageous and get past my own <br/>\ninsecurities for my children&#39;s sake.  I would appreciate your prayers--this <br/>\nis not an easy journey for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to getting to know all of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5154,"nextTopicId":5139}}
