Sincerely not condemning, just wondering how the whole not bathing thing gets so bad that a kid smells?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m just thinking that when a child gets used to it, showering or bathing every night, then they feel odd not having one instead of the other way around. Now sensory problems aside on this one as I understand how that would complicate things. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of sensory issues with son Joseph but up until now there were a couple techniques that worked reasonably well when it came to getting in the bath or shower.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne was what I&#39;d call &quot;go with the flow&quot;, for lack of a better term.  Every few days I&#39;d tell all the kids that it was bath or shower night (so it wasn&#39;t a surprise).  That evening I&#39;d start with one of younger kids who didn&#39;t mind, and Joseph would likely come upstairs since that&#39;s where we all were.  When the others were done I&#39;d just say &quot;your turn&quot;, and engage him in some interesting conversation, about his current video game or a recent fun activity, while I helped him take off his clothes.  Quite often he just &quot;went with the flow&quot; and got in the shower.  Other times he walk into the bathroom, hear the running water, tense up and say &quot;I just can&#39;t tonight, Mom&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that happened a couple times in a row I&#39;d go with plan B, where I&#39;d tell him it&#39;s been quite a while since he last washed his body, would he like to have a bath or a shower?  I&#39;d mention he could bring up some plastic character toys to play with and I&#39;d colour the water or make bubbles if he&#39;d like for a bath or, if he&#39;s busy with something, a shower is really quick and he can get back to it. Sometimes he&#39;d say &quot;neither&quot;, but after a day or two he was usually clean.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, neither of these things have been working the last couple of months.  I&#39;ve been thinking about it though and the timing seems to coincide with his more obvious signs of puberty i.e. hair growth and body odour.  Joseph has never been one to  &quot;embrace&quot; change at the best of times, and this is some change!!  I&#39;m thinking he may be uncomfortable with his physically changing body and avoiding showers/baths for that reason.  Right now all we can do when we go out is a wipedown with a cloth and a fresh shirt, and the occasional hairwash in the sink.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I&#39;m doing now is trying to make him more comfortable with the changes by mentioning them in conversation when we&#39;re alone.  He doesn&#39;t want to talk much about it, but I figure if he hears me talking/knowing about the changes to expect he will see that they are normal.  And then hopefully time will help him get used to his &quot;new&quot; body.  With swimming season around the corner this should give us a few months leeway!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other suggestions for helping him get used to this new stage of his life?<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:  Re: Respect and baths","postDate":"1053617175","msgId":70356,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwNi4yMzgwM2YzOC4yYmZlNDYxN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70355,"nextInTopic":70361,"prevInTime":70355,"nextInTime":70357,"topicId":70231,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/22/03 6:44:06 AM, KathrynJB@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1471370111\">In a message dated 5/22/03 6:44:06 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KathrynJB@...\">KathrynJB@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Then puberty hit.

Yeah, they all take baths &quot;normally&quot;, routinely,  a daily or <br/>\nevery other day thing with no complaints at all.  They have all enjoyed baths as <br/>\nyounger children..

From my POV he<br/>\nwas being a totalitarian, and lazy, jerk who expected me to do<br/>\neverything, while my priorities were looking after Jayn instead of the<br/>\nhouse. He refused to see that any of it was in any way partly his<br/>\nresponsibility. (I should add he is not working.) As the argument<br/>\nprogressed the true state of things eventually came out. It turned out<br/>\nthat he thought I didn&#39;t love him anymore, and feared I was planning to<br/>\nleave him, and that&#39;s why I wasn&#39;t paying attention to his home and<br/>\nlaundry and stuff. Of course this came as an immense surprise to me,<br/>\nthat he so strongly viewed my taking care of the house as being loving<br/>\ntowards him. We tell each other we love other all the time, so I was<br/>\nfloored that he could feel this doubtful. We had been snapping at each<br/>\nother for days before the fight, and were certainly crying together<br/>\nafterwards. I have tried harder and he has become more relaxed,<br/>\nappreciative and pleasant. Still won&#39;t pick up his own socks, let alone<br/>\nany of Jayn&#39;s toys, but I have stopped expecting, or more accurately<br/>\nhoping, for that to happen.

I have this same problem <br/>\nwith Ethan.  It just comes down to, we can&#39;t stand to be around him.  Its <br/>\noffensive, no, its disgusting ( I let him get THAT bad)  His body odor and <br/>\nhis foot odor both.  ( he won&#39;t wear socks with his shoes)   When we can not <br/>\nstand to be around him, and he does not want to go into another room,  I make <br/>\nhim take a bath.  I have not found another solution.  I have talked to him, <br/>\nvery respectfully, about WHY he needs to bathe.  He understands about body <br/>\nodor.  Heck, we all get it sometimes and he finds it offensive too.   It&#39;s <br/>\nnot like he does not understand foul odors.  I have picked Landon up from.   <br/>\nworking outside in the field and  he reeks!  And Ethan does not want to sit <br/>\nnext to him in the van until Landon can get home to take a shower.  I have <br/>\ntaken that opportunity to explain that is how we feel when he (Ethan) stinks. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sometimes, when he really stinks, and we are going somewhere, I give him <br/>\nthe option of bathing or staying at home.  He usually chooses to stay at <br/>\nhome.  Sometimes, I do not have the option of leaving him at home, so I make <br/>\nhim bathe.  I have to physically walk him into the bathroom, turn the water <br/>\non for him, and then repeatedly check to make sure he gets in the shower.   <br/>\nThen I have to remind him to put on deodorant.  I will let him just &quot;wash up&quot; <br/>\nunder his arms as often as that gets him by.   I buy antibacterial wipes for <br/>\nhim to use. <br/>\n<br/>\n Still, the bottom line is, when he stinks so bad that we can not stand to be <br/>\nnear him, and/or we have to go be around other people,  I make him take a <br/>\nshower.   I wish I didn&#39;t have to, but I DO think it is a matter of <br/>\nrespecting other folks too.   The only reason he will give as to why he will <br/>\nnot shower is &quot;because I don&#39;t want to&quot;  Basically, he does not want to take <br/>\nthe time to do it.  Lots of folks would call it &quot;too lazy&quot;.   Maybe if <br/>\nsomeone outside of our family told him he stinks, it would have more weight <br/>\nto it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"Heidi","from":"&quot;Heidi&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Respect and baths","postDate":"1053568188","msgId":70292,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJhaGFicyt0aHV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA1YjcwMWMzMWZkMiQxOTdhODk0MCQ2NDAxYThjMEB0YXJ6YW4+"},"prevInTopic":70239,"nextInTopic":70294,"prevInTime":70291,"nextInTime":70293,"topicId":70231,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When I was in eighth grade, in science class I sat myself down and the boy next to me (Randy something.

So I have a question along those<br/>\nlines of respecting choices and how to put that into practice when it comes<br/>\nup against other things. Here&#39;s my current for-instance: my son hates baths,<br/>\nbathing, showers, etc. basically anything to do with washing and water. So<br/>\nit&#39;s not generally something I force on him, and usually he gets clean when<br/>\nwe go swimming once or twice a week (he doesn&#39;t mind showering afterwards as<br/>\nmuch as normal because he hates being itchy from the chlorine even more). In<br/>\nthe last two weeks, we haven&#39;t been able to get to the pool though and he&#39;s<br/>\nstarting to get a little...um...ripe. In fact, when DH got in the car<br/>\nyesterday, he thought he had stepped in dog poop, the smell was that bad. So<br/>\ntoday I&#39;m insisting on a bath or shower, just for common courtesy to others<br/>\n(we&#39;re carpooling someplace this afternoon, for instance, and I don&#39;t think<br/>\nit&#39;s right to submit others to that kind of enclosed aroma).<br/>\nI guess my question for others is this: How do you go about respecting their<br/>\nchoices and their bodies when those choices cause problems in other areas<br/>\n(like assaulting someone else&#39;s nose!). My son has some fairly severe<br/>\nsensory issues, and we&#39;ve come up against this before. Teeth brushing was a<br/>\nbad one. For two years, I just avoided forcing him to brush his teeth<br/>\nbecause he hated it so much. Then, after $2000 worth of dental work on him<br/>\n(two of his teeth were so rotten they broke), I decided I was going to force<br/>\nthe issue (before that, I had of course tried everything else under the<br/>\nsun - singing teeth brushing songs, buying books about dentists and teeth<br/>\nbrushing, buying cool electric toothbrushes in the shapes of race cars, 18<br/>\ndifferent flavors of toothpaste, etc. etc.). It still never felt like a good<br/>\nchoice, because he hated it so much, but I felt I had ran out of options. So<br/>\nhow do you go about this when it is unlikely that anytime soon they are<br/>\ngoing to start voluntarily (taking baths, brushing teeth, etc.).<br/>\nI did sit down and have a talk with my son this morning about why the bath<br/>\nis important, and offered to build some Alpha Team Lego subs with him to<br/>\ntake in the bath, that has made for grudging acceptance. But I still know he<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do it if I wasn&#39;t forcing the issue (forcing as in me saying, we<br/>\ncan&#39;t carpool with his friends if he doesn&#39;t bathe).<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70706,"nextTopicId":70514}}
