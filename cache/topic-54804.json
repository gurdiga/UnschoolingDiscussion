Please don&#39;t, because<br/>\nthat&#39;s not the point of this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s called pro-CHOICE, not pro-abortion.  As in, I&#39;m in favor of women<br/>\nhaving the right to choose.  I&#39;m not in favor of telling everyone they<br/>\nshould have abortions.  There&#39;s a world of difference between those two<br/>\nstatements.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m strongly pro-choice.  I&#39;ve also never had an abortion.  Just because I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t choose to have one myself doesn&#39;t mean that I think it shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\navailable.  I wouldn&#39;t have breast implants, either.  But I&#39;d rather it was<br/>\ndone under sterile medical circumstances than by anybody who thought they<br/>\ncould do it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re welcome to think of me as your enemy.  But you should KNOW your<br/>\nenemy.  Not just the stuff that your friends provide you about them, but the<br/>\nthings they can tell you themselves.  Listen to women here.  We might have<br/>\ndifferent views, but we&#39;re real women who hold those views.  Not the<br/>\nstereotypes you might previously have held of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54797,"nextTopicId":54805}}
