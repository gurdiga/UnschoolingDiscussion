We are moving to Winona though, so I am not sure how often we <br/>\nwould make it up there for that.    I will keep it in mind though.

I just I just <br/>\nneed to be reassured that the big bad scary school board/government is not <br/>\ngoing to come force me to put my kids back into school just because they do <br/>\nnot like the way we chose to educate our kids ( I STILL do not understand <br/>\nwhy it is ANY of their business anyway!!).<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great day!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandi in St Louis<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&quot;What we want to see is the child in pursuit of knowledge, not knowledge in <br/>\npursuit of the child.&quot;<br/>\n-- George Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\nPiston Ported Vespas:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.nbci.com/piston_ported/index.html\">http://members.nbci.com/piston_ported/index.html</a><br/>\nwords<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/vespass/words.html\">http://www.geocities.com/vespass/words.html</a><br/>\nST Louis Secular Homeschooler&#39;s Co-Op<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stlsecularhomeschool.org\">http://www.stlsecularhomeschool.org</a><br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"strandbe@aol.com","from":"strandbe@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"oANzwu6u4ZBtWY0rdy28Wo2VQ3nCjdW7LVWUb8cdcYXVMqFAXNsx6tR55b1vSIheMFR6sObI-w","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Minnesota Unschoolers!","postDate":"979790912","msgId":15171,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVjLjVmYmM5YTUuMjc5N2M2NDFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15180,"prevInTime":15170,"nextInTime":15172,"topicId":15171,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, Sandi, I m not spending much time reading list mail these days, so it was pretty ironic that I saw your post!
