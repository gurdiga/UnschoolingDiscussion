I&#39;m a homeschooling mom and do freelance marketing/PR work.  <br/>\nI&#39;m currently doing a marketing job for an education web site called <br/>\nProject Power.  An innovative site devoted to enhancing learning <br/>\nthrough hands-on projects, Project Power combines great projects <br/>\nwith convenient tools to assign and manage projects online.<br/>\n <br/>\nCurrently, the site is used by public schools, but it will soon be <br/>\nopened to homeschoolers.  I am helping them evaluate appropriate <br/>\npricing and changes to the web site to make it as friendly as <br/>\npossible to homeschool users.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn that effort, I am seeking a group of 15 to 20 homeschoolers who <br/>\nwould like to try the site for free for 30 days and provide feedback <br/>\nto the company at the end of their trial.  (A 10-day trial is <br/>\navailable to any visitor).<br/>\n <br/>\nYou can peruse the site at www.projectpower.com.  If you&#39;re <br/>\ninterested in participating in the trial and shaping the site for <br/>\nthe homeschool community, please e-mail me at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dmarinelli09@...\">dmarinelli09@...</a>.<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you,<br/>\n <br/>\nDiane Marinelli</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90092,"nextTopicId":90100}}
