I was diagnosed with fibromyalga (sp?) last<br/>\nsummer, after years of suffering with some of the symptoms from time to<br/>\ntime. Fortunatly, for me, I found a great rhumatologist, who actually<br/>\nbelieves every word I say. How&#39;s that for a rare doctor? Anyhow , you said<br/>\nthat doctors won&#39;t see you unless you take all previous records with you. My<br/>\nquestion is why do they have to know who you&#39;ve seen in the past and who you<br/>\nhaven&#39;t? Couldn&#39;t you, for example, go to a new rhumatologist and start from<br/>\nscratch. You could tell him all of your symptoms and let him decide if he<br/>\nfeels he can either make a diagnosis on his own or send you to a<br/>\nneurologist. I know this isn&#39;t the most honest approach and is fround upon<br/>\nin the medical circles, but my feeling is, if it gets you the help you need<br/>\nin the end it will all be worth it. As you know, diagnosing any autoimmune<br/>\ndisorder can be a painstaking proccess, but I&#39;ve known so many people,<br/>\nmyself included that in the end were so glad they stuck with it. Sometimes<br/>\njust knowing what you have can change your outlook. Anyhow, good luck and<br/>\nplease keep me posted.<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FreeSchool@...\">FreeSchool@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, April 01, 2000 1:52 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: Fibro,Lupus,Chronic Fatigue,MS was Re: [Unschooling-dotcom]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 3/31/00 9:36:46 AM Central Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:klement@...\">klement@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;  will tell you this though ... the majority of auto immune disorder<br/>\n&gt;  patients I&#39;ve had personal contact with have had to fight like hell to<br/>\n&gt;  be treated decently and honestly.<br/>\n&gt;  An informed patient has to tread carefully so as not to bruise doctors&#39;<br/>\n&gt;  egos and get the treatment they deserve!!!!!! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Buzz,<br/>\n&gt;     I agree, that is why I have given up for the time being!  The last<br/>\ntime I<br/>\n&gt; went to see a &quot;specialist&quot; that my family doctor referred me to, he gave<br/>\nme<br/>\n&gt; all of 10 minutes of his time.  He said to me&quot;Well, if I just looked at<br/>\nyour<br/>\n&gt; history, I would say it was MS.<br/>\n&gt; However, the neurologist (the one that was a jerk!) said that you don&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; Therefore, I don&#39;t see any reason to have an MRI, because you don&#39;t have<br/>\nMS.<br/>\n&gt; It worries me that you have _______ with this, as this is usually<br/>\nindicative<br/>\n&gt; of MS.  But once again, I just don&#39;t think it is because the neurologist<br/>\nsaid<br/>\n&gt; that you don&#39;t have it.  I think you should start looking in another<br/>\n&gt; direction.  I can&#39;t help you.&quot;  That was the last straw for me.<br/>\nBasically,<br/>\n&gt; he took one persons word (who believe me was such a jerk, that I would<br/>\nnever<br/>\n&gt; want to mess with her again) and refused to even examine me.  It didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; matter that family went with me and tried to tell him how I am really<br/>\nsick,<br/>\n&gt; he just didn&#39;t want to take the time.  If only I could see someone without<br/>\n&gt; taking the records from that one doctor, however, they won&#39;t ever see me<br/>\n&gt; unless I forward everything!  That one doctor is really hurting my case.<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; need to start off fresh, but it just won&#39;t happen.  I am so tired of<br/>\nbeating<br/>\n&gt; my head against a brick wall!  Well, sorry to go off like that, but this<br/>\n&gt; subject is very touching to me.

I&#39;ve  always had fatigue and pain and have just gotten use to them.  I <br/>\nwent in 2 yrs ago and the doctor I saw was almost hostile towards me so I never <br/>\nwent back.  But then I started having worse symptoms and decided it was time to <br/>\ngo in again.  The first time I saw the doctor I was in severe pain and also <br/>\nalmost felt drunk and I thought wow he really cares.  But the next time I saw <br/>\nhim I was feeling much better and clear headed and realized that he was doing <br/>\nall the talking and hardly listening, so how could he be really caring about <br/>\nme?  Does this make sense?  I&#39;m starting to feel crappy again and having <br/>\nproblems writing cohertenly.  This is all pretty scary and I feel really lost <br/>\nwithout a diagnosis.  It&#39;d be so much easier to find support if I knew what was <br/>\nwrong with me.  It&#39;s hard too with my husband probably originally thinking it <br/>\nwas all in my head (though he didn&#39;t say so), to now worrying if I&#39;m going to <br/>\nbe able to take care of the kids.  I&#39;d like to thank everyone here who took the <br/>\ntime to answer my original post and I&#39;m sorry to bring this issue here to the <br/>\nunschooling board, but so far this has been my best support system.

I back up every word you&#39;ve said about <br/>\n&gt; this.  It is exactly the same for lupus.  It&#39;s known as the great imitator <br/>\n&gt; because it can look like so many other things.  From the time symptoms appear <br/>\n&gt; until lupus is diagnosed is an average of 7 years.  Patients are often made <br/>\n&gt; to feel that it&#39;s all in their heads.  My lupus involves my central nervous <br/>\n&gt; system and so it almost perfectly mimics MS.  I went through the wringer with <br/>\n&gt; doctors looking my MRIs over and telling me that there was nothing wrong with <br/>\n&gt; me.  They said that my loss of vision (actually optic neuritis, of course) <br/>\n&gt; and my numbness and weakness were just manifestations of hysteria.  I began <br/>\n&gt; to feel terrible about myself and to question my own sanity.  Turns out I was <br/>\n&gt; right and they were wrong.
