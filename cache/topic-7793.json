Thanks<br/>\nfor your thoughts!<br/>\nJill<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Tracy Oldfield &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Tracy@...\">Tracy@...</a>-online.co.uk&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sorry to hear about your troubles, Marcie.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; pray, but will be thinking about you.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure where I stand about the whole maths<br/>\n&gt; thing, why is it necessary to think about things in<br/>\n&gt; subjects?  Arithmetic, which a lot of folk see as<br/>\n&gt; maths, tends to be something which people either get<br/>\n&gt; or don&#39;t, which is why we have calculators.  But<br/>\n&gt; that doesn&#39;t mean that people who can&#39;t add can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think about the dimensions of things, measure<br/>\n&gt; things, count notes to play music.  Not being able<br/>\n&gt; to spell well doesn&#39;t mean that someone can&#39;t write<br/>\n&gt; beautiful poetry, it means they need a spell-checker<br/>\n&gt; or an editor.  Not being able to write neatly<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean that someone can&#39;t write fascinating<br/>\n&gt; articles for magazines, it means they use a<br/>\n&gt; word-processor.  Not being able to tell the time<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean that one can&#39;t understand why the Jews<br/>\n&gt; were sent to concentration camps in our recent<br/>\n&gt; history, or that dinosaurs are extinct, in our<br/>\n&gt; long-distant past.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is another big part of unschooling, being able<br/>\n&gt; to recognise the ways we learn best, being able to<br/>\n&gt; recognise our talents and using those talents to get<br/>\n&gt; where we want to be (even to figure out where we<br/>\n&gt; want to be, which is probably much more difficult<br/>\n&gt; :-) )  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ooooh, I&#39;m full of it tonight :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tracy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
