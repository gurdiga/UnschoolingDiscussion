From what I understand I was to be a boy. <br/>\nI paid dearly for that.<br/>\nWhen I lived with him I was beaten because I didn&#39;t wake up with a smile. <br/>\nEvery morning my stepmother would stand at the top of the stairs and wait. If <br/>\nI was not smiling and did not say good morning back I was punished and hit. <br/>\nThis went on for months. I refused to do that and why the hell did it matter <br/>\nanyway?  If they would have just let me wake up I would have been fine. I <br/>\nstill wake up grumpy at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is a better man now and we have talked about it. Actually when I was 22 I <br/>\nwas very much a big drinker.  One night I called him totally drunk and let <br/>\nhim have it. I told him I hated what he did to me and that most of my <br/>\nchildhood was spent dealing with what he had done to me. We talked for hours <br/>\nthat night.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a very quiet child and would never talk to any adults. I constantly <br/>\nherd &quot;oh she&#39;s so quiet.&quot; Gee I wonder why?<br/>\n<br/>\nFact is I joined the Marines because he said I was too cocky to make it <br/>\nthrough any boot camp. So I joined the hardest one.  Well, I showed him. I <br/>\nwas also able to deal with my anger. Boot camp broke me. I was angry that <br/>\nthey pushed me so hard but in the last month I learned a lot about my self.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was/am a survivor or abuse, rape and was dumped child. I was in a foster <br/>\nhome (right across the street from my family) and my foster father also raped <br/>\nme when I was 13.  I was confused and very reckless later.  My Mom who <br/>\nthought she was the know it all of drug detection accused me of using drugs. <br/>\nI did experiment later but I has actually been secretly drinking for years. <br/>\nIt was the constant accusations that drove me to try drugs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI will never do that to my kids. I talk to them about everything. My oldest <br/>\nknows if he needs to come to me he can.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt almost 33 I wish I knew then what I know now.  I think I am still a work <br/>\nin progress and their are missing years in my life.  I was tested constantly. <br/>\nI know those tests especially the one with the physiologist holds the answers <br/>\nto the missing information. My Mom has them and keeps making excuses like she <br/>\ncant find them etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI let it go until an old friend of the family told me a few years ago that <br/>\nshe is proud of me and had really thought I would not have made it past 18.  <br/>\nNot a good thing to tell me but part of me is glad someone knew something cuz <br/>\nsomething was eating away at me.<br/>\nShe is very I&#39;ll right now. I am afraid she will pass and I will never know. <br/>\nMaybe from her concerns it is best I don&#39;t know...... She is a great woman <br/>\nand I know she is keeping it for a good reason.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, maybe too much information but this is what was in my head when I <br/>\nread some of the posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":93802122,"authorName":"Tim and Maureen","from":"Tim and Maureen &lt;tmthomas@...&gt;","profile":"wisdom0007","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Was: Am I just being naïv\te?

Well, of course we would end up in the giggles <br/>\n  probably from stress&lt;G&gt; and then get yelled at, maybe spanked.  It is <br/>\n  so ridiculous to me, all I want to do is hear my kids laugh.  It is <br/>\n  always the right time for that!  We are all pretty relaxed around <br/>\n  here.  I think humor is the cornerstone for our marriage and how we <br/>\n  interact with the kids.  We are always laughing at eachother, <br/>\n  probably too much..LOL!

I <br/>\n  still do<br/>\n  &gt; things like that for Tara. Sometimes without her asking I&#39;ll just <br/>\n  go and<br/>\n  &gt; finish food she started cooking and bring it to her. She is just so <br/>\n  happy to<br/>\n  &gt; have me do it. And like this morning, she stayed home from school <br/>\n  and came<br/>\n  &gt; out all sleepy and kissing me and said &quot;Mommy&quot; in a voice that I <br/>\n  know she&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt; going to ask for something. I always tease when she uses that tone <br/>\n  and just<br/>\n  &gt; say no and she laughs. She was hungry for pancakes. Now she&#39;s quite <br/>\n  capable<br/>\n  &gt; of making them herself and I was doing about 5 other things but so <br/>\n  what?
