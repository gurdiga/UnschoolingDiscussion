I agree, though, that it&#39;s unlikely to be<br/>\nparticularly dangerous to them to go up a couple of steps on store ladders.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see it as a social issue, though, in that I have empathy for the employees<br/>\nwho are generally low-wage and low-power and who could get in trouble if one<br/>\nof their many bosses -- many of whom are low-wage and low-power themselves<br/>\n-- sees children climbing on the ladders. So, in those cases, I see my older<br/>\nchildren&#39;s desire to climb on those structures as valid, but ultimately less<br/>\nimportant than the employees&#39; needs to keep their jobs. Climbing on the<br/>\nladder is more a whim, and, although I&#39;m all for helping kids fulfill their<br/>\nwhims, I don&#39;t want to do it at the expense of others -- and they can and do<br/>\nclimb in a lot of other places.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre people&#39;s jobs really at risk from kids on ladders? Maybe not. Are some<br/>\npeople overreacting? Undoubtedly. But I don&#39;t want to stress out people who<br/>\nare already dealing with a stressful-in-its-powerlessness job (see &quot;Nickel<br/>\nand Dimed&quot; by Barbara Ehrenreich for an interesting picture of life in<br/>\nretail -- I don&#39;t agree with all her conclusions, but the portrait is worth<br/>\na read). It just doesn&#39;t seem kind. Plus, it keeps our shopping trips more<br/>\npleasant when employees aren&#39;t yelling at us. My kids know that the store<br/>\nrules are &quot;no customers on the ladders.&quot; My older kids (7 & 9) understand<br/>\nwhy -- &quot;fear of lawsuits&quot; as opposed to &quot;you&#39;ll fall and get hurt.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen<br/>\nin LA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109157,"nextTopicId":109166}}
