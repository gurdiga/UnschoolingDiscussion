People are much more<br/>\ncomfortable with breastfeeding now than they were even a few years ago.<br/>\nThey&#39;ve seen people doing it relatively discreetly, and they&#39;ve seen<br/>\npictures in National Geographic or TV.  But I think the real progress is<br/>\nlikely made because children and teens are seeing it done more.  My son&#39;s<br/>\ngirlfriend was probably not nursed, and she&#39;s watched her niece being given<br/>\nbottles.  But now she&#39;s watched my daughter not only nursing an infant but<br/>\nalso the almost 3 year old.  I think now she&#39;s more likely to nurse her<br/>\nbabies than she was.  But my daughter doesn&#39;t whip it out.  She gives<br/>\naccess.  There&#39;s a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were at an outdoor concert I played in a couple of weeks ago.  The<br/>\nalmost 3 was nursing, and a little girl maybe a bit older was completely<br/>\nshocked, asking her mother why he was sucking on his mother&#39;s boob.  She<br/>\nkept asking and talking about it, and eventually asked Kaelin why he was<br/>\nsucking on his mother&#39;s boob.  His answer?  &quot;Uh, I suck the milk out.&quot;  Too<br/>\ncute.  That little girl now has something new to think about.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where<br/>\nthere is no path and leave a trail.&quot;<br/>\n- Ralph Waldo Emerson</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80565,"nextTopicId":80659}}
