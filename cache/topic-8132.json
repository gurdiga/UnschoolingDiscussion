Is it legal to change your own? <br/>\n<br/>\nShouldn&#39;t you let a trained professional do it? Won&#39;t your little lamp<br/>\nbe brighter if someone who studied for four years (after barely being<br/>\nable to turn on their own<br/>\nlamp) changes your light bulb? What if you screw it in wrong? What if<br/>\nyou leave something out? Don&#39;t you think you should give your little<br/>\nnursery lamp a chance to<br/>\nbe part of a huge, glowing marquee or chandelier? Bulbs do need to hang<br/>\nin groups, you know. <br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, why do you think light bulbs come in multi packs? You don&#39;t<br/>\njust go out and get a single light bulb! If one light bulb needs fixing,<br/>\nthen you know the others<br/>\nare ready for it, too. Give your professional a 12 pack and let him/her<br/>\nchange them all at once. It&#39;s much more efficient and gets you on a<br/>\nschedule with all your light<br/>\nfixtures. And yes, I know you will end up sending some perfectly good<br/>\nlight bulbs to the trash that way, but on the whole it&#39;s best. Don&#39;t<br/>\nregret the ones that are lost<br/>\nto the dump. They were probably pretty dim anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nLook, I sent my lamps to the shop for light-bulb changing and my lamps<br/>\nwork okay, don&#39;t they? Oh, well, except for that three-way lamp in the<br/>\nliving room which<br/>\ngot a stupid 40 watt, low-lumens bulb put in when it should have gotten<br/>\na three way bulb with up to 200 watts. I was a little peeved at that at<br/>\nfirst, but I just put the<br/>\nlamp over in the corner where I never sit to read, so it&#39;s okay. <br/>\n<br/>\nCoyright 2000 by Clare Bussjaeger but feel free to share if you get a<br/>\nkick out of it and will retain my copyright notice including this entire<br/>\nsentence.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8103,"nextTopicId":8076}}
