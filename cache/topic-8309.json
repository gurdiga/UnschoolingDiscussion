We practice at home about 4 times a week.  He<br/>\n&gt;was making excellent progress unti we took a vacation and didn&#39;t practice<br/>\n&gt;for several weeks.  He has lost some of the skills he had acquired and is<br/>\n&gt;not making much progress.  His main problem is with  &quot;s.&quot;  He sticks his<br/>\n&gt;tongue out between his teeth when he says it.  He needs to practice not<br/>\n&gt;doing so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think the problem is that he&#39;s not trying.  He doesn&#39;t seem to perceive<br/>\n&gt;there is a problem,though now that he&#39;s regressed adults have a hard time<br/>\n&gt;understanding him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My question is &quot;how can I help motivate him?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have decided I will no longer interpret what he says to adults.

He might not even hear when he&#39;s lisping and when he&#39;s not, so he might <br/>\nneed your help discerning that.
