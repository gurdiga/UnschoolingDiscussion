There&#39;s a world of difference between the play of a two year old and <br/>\na five year old.  When my oldest son was little, he had a friend named <br/>\nSteven.  They had a lot in common and played well together.  When the mom <br/>\ndecided that if you wanted to play with Steven, you had to play with younger <br/>\nbrother Joey, too, the friendship suffered.  <br/>\n  Some kids just don&#39;t mix and forcing the matter may not help.  Sounds like <br/>\nyour children have a great relationship otherwise.  <br/>\n  I think it&#39;s ok for them to have their own friends.<br/>\nMary J<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45982,"nextTopicId":46036}}
