They *prescribe* the &quot;right&quot; way to say things or write<br/>\nthings. This is a fairly new idea, by the way.... <br/>\n<br/>\nLinguists are concerned with describing the ways people communicate. They<br/>\ndon&#39;t judge, and they don&#39;t consider one way more correct than another.<br/>\nOne caveat - this is applied to groups of people, not individuals. A ten<br/>\nyr old born and raised in Tucson who said /y/ for /l/ would be considered<br/>\nto have a speech problem. However, in some regions people say &quot;yellow&quot; as<br/>\nyell-oh, other places it&#39;s pronounced yah-ler. Linguistically speaking,<br/>\nthis is all equally correct and fine and good.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my 21 year old sister  is taking both a linguistics class and an<br/>\nEnglish class this semester. In her linguistics class one day, they<br/>\nlearned about phonology (basically, the study of a language&#39;s sounds and<br/>\nthe pronounciation of words), and about the regional differences in the<br/>\npronounciation of some phonemes. Then she went straight to English class,<br/>\nwhere the teacher told them they&#39;d be tested on their ablity to use<br/>\nstandard symbols and letters to write the pronounciation of words (like<br/>\nin a dictionary). Of course, my sister had just learned that there were<br/>\nregional variations in pronounciation, so she told the teacher that she<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t ask them to do that, because some people pronounced things<br/>\ndifferently and it was okay to do so, and any way someone pronounced a<br/>\nword was right.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the teacher blew her off, which wasn&#39;t  good but my sister had  been<br/>\npretty rude, as I heard it. So she stopped going to that class, which is<br/>\nwhy after 4 years of college she&#39;s a sophomore still. I did try to<br/>\nexplain the whole thing to her, but she&#39;d already decided that the<br/>\nEnglish teacher didn&#39;t know anything so I didn&#39;t make much of a dent.<br/>\n<br/>\ndar<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
