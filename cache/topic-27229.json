There used to be a ps registration program out of a rural school division.  They would give $200/year for supplies and had no requirements whatsoever for reporting.  That school division is currently under investigation for mis-use of funds in their adult ed programs, though, and all their distance programs have been shut down.  The province loosened up the homeschooling regs this year, though, and made the process of notification easier and more painless.  The main draw of the Lowe Farm school was that it was very easy to comply with the ed. laws, all you had to do was fill out the ps registration form (basically just name, age, address) and that was all that was expected from you for the year, while at the time the regs required an outline and pretty thorough description of your program.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow the process is pretty easy, just a standard notification form, and two reports.  The one in January just requires checkmarks next to the subjects if &quot;student has progressed&quot; LOL.  I&#39;ve already filled this one out.  The June one has to be a bit more in depth, but still basically one sentence per subject, no grades, no outside assessment.  All I have to write is how I&#39;ve seen progress in the subject (ie: Owen reads comfortably on his own now.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only current programs (that I know of, but I&#39;m not looking into PS help too much right now, LOL, we just got out of that) are two highschool programs.  They both sound pretty flexible, and are not aimed only at homeschoolers, but also teen parents, kids who live on their own and work, and kids with chronic health problems.  I don&#39;t know too much about how good these programs are, they&#39;re still pretty new.  They sound quite flexible, there is a small classroom and a teacher set aside for the program, kids can decide how many courses they want to take, if they want to go to class, do class work in the hs room, or follow the provincial correspondence course.  They can participate in sports, music classes, orchestra, etc.  I don&#39;t know how independant the family really is, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAllison<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Tia Leschke <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, November 02, 2001 1:27 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Choices in charters<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  At 04:54 PM 11/1/01 -0800, you wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;That is the point, again.

I&#39;m sure this is what a lot of people are concerned about, but it <br/>\n  didn&#39;t happen in Alberta because of charter schools or ps homeschooling <br/>\n  programs.

Canada has quite a few distance and homebound type school programs, because some school districts have more square miles in their district area than they do students, so I think that the gov&#39;t has had to deal with these kinds of arrangements more than in the States.  &quot;Virtual schools&quot; have existed here for decades, before the internet, lessons used to be broadcast to isolated students over the radio.

The way it works here (I think) is that the <br/>\ngovernment decides each year how much each district will get per kid.  They <br/>\nget extra for certain other things like kids with learning disabilities or <br/>\na certain percentage of native or esl kids.  They don&#39;t get the money if <br/>\nthey don&#39;t have the kids, but then they don&#39;t have to provide any services <br/>\nfor kids that aren&#39;t enrolled.  So the local boards really have nothing to <br/>\ngain by enticing kids into or back into the system, though they do seem to <br/>\nbargain a bit with parents who have labelled kids.  I&#39;d think that the <br/>\nprovincial government actually gains by having lots of homeschooled <br/>\nkids.  If all the kids who are hs went back to school, they&#39;d have a hell <br/>\nof a time providing for them.  Even the kids on the distance programs like <br/>\nwe&#39;re on save the government money because there are no capital building <br/>\ncosts.

It was because they insisted on shipping Christian materials that<br/>\nwere erroneously ordered (sometimes it was impossible to tell from the<br/>\ndescription whether something was or was not religious), whereas other<br/>\nvendors that csarried both secular and religious materials had agreed not<br/>\nto ship Horizon anything with a religious basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaron<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!

Sounds like you&#39;re going to <br/>\nhave to get pro-active on the state level.  I think your current law is <br/>\nsimilar to what we had in BC until about 1989.  It didn&#39;t mention <br/>\nhomeschooling as such, but said that parents were exempt from sending their <br/>\nkids to school if they were providing an education that a judge would <br/>\nconsider sufficient, or some such wording.  Basically it meant that it was <br/>\nup to the school district to prove that it wasn&#39;t good enough.  When it <br/>\nlooked like the government wanted to do something different with the law, <br/>\nour provincial organization got moving and did a lot of lobbying, etc. and <br/>\ngot the great law that we have now.  If something like that is going to <br/>\nhappen, you want to get going on it and start convincing legislators <br/>\n*before* HSLDA gets involved.  Get as many people that are using public <br/>\nprograms involved as you can.  Hook them in on the idea that they might <br/>\neventually want to be independent homeschoolers and would want the law to <br/>\nmake that possible.

Yup, they are high, but otoh, CSRA did all the<br/>\nstart-up work for these schools, and those fees were really about that as<br/>\nwell. The charters are free to contract with different companies after<br/>\ntheir contract expires, I think next year for most of them...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and push Christian curriculum telling charters <br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; only certain catelogs/companies can provide the resources they want <br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; infact all the items are available without a Christian agenda.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is simply not true. People cannot order any Christian based<br/>\ncurriculum and have the charters pay for it, because they are public<br/>\nschools.  Any catalog willing to accept purchase orders can become an<br/>\napproved vendor, if the charter itself requests that they be approved.<br/>\nBilly and Nancy Greer&#39;s F.U.N. (Family Unschoolers Network) Books was on<br/>\nthe list for at least two one2one charters last year (I specifically<br/>\nrequested them :-)... Borders was on our list, so were Nasco, Dick Blick,<br/>\nAcorn Naturalist, and lots more... and yeah, so were Tobin&#39;s Lab and<br/>\nRainbow Resource, which are Christian but they have darn cool stuff at<br/>\ndarn cheap prices. Actually, many of the charters wouldn&#39;t allow<br/>\nChristian companies to be approved just because they didn&#39;t want to give<br/>\nthe appearance of being only for Christian homeschoolers... Horizon <br/>\ndropped Rainbow, for instance.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; And while some of the charters they managed may be have benefited <br/>\n&gt; from their<br/>\n&gt; oversight, many, many were robbed!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And you can back this up?<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!

The problem with that is that they aren&#39;t all like <br/>\nthat.  I&#39;ve explained how it works in BC.  You&#39;re obviously familiar with <br/>\nhow it works in Calif., at least in your area.  What about other <br/>\nfolks?  How is it actually working in other parts of the States?  At this <br/>\ntime, I think BC is the only province with these kinds of programs.  In <br/>\nAlberta, all homeschoolers have to jump through more hoops than the <br/>\nElectronic bus families in BC.  They get money, but have no choice to opt <br/>\nout.  I&#39;m sure this is what a lot of people are concerned about, but it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t happen in Alberta because of charter schools or ps homeschooling <br/>\nprograms.  It happened because some homeschoolers pushed for financial <br/>\nsupport, and the government decided to give it to everyone, no opting <br/>\nout.  This is what we&#39;re working to prevent in BC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The money doesn&#39;t benefit kids, it doesn&#39;t even put too many people to work<br/>\n&gt;and those it does are paid minimum wages with the &quot;owner&quot; of these companies<br/>\n&gt;hauling in the $$.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can certainly see why you&#39;re against these programs, the way they work in <br/>\nyour area.

This is big business so they are working hard to get as<br/>\nmany folks as they can.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t care about these kids and at least 2, if not 3 now are under<br/>\ninvestigation because the supplies they promise aren&#39;t showing up OR they<br/>\nare showing up half way or even later in the school year.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marbleface@...\">marbleface@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 01, 2001 6:04 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Choices in charters<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 11/01/2001 9:28:13 AM !!!First Boot!!!,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moonmeghan@...\">moonmeghan@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; .
