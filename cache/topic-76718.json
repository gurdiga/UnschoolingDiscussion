I of course told her I was<br/>\ngoing to home school and she responded in a loud voice saying - &quot;what, our<br/>\nelementary school isn&#39;t good enough for you&quot; - wow!  the assumptions she<br/>\nmade with out knowing anything about me and my family.  Do these things<br/>\nhappen to everyone that home schools or do I just put myself in the wrong<br/>\nsocial groups??**<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, Susan --<br/>\n<br/>\nNice to meet you!  Lots of people get flak for choosing homeschooling. <br/>\nNot everyone is as rude as that lady, though.  It&#39;s hard to know if her<br/>\nsnotty remark meant &quot;Our local school is great&quot; or, worse, &quot;Our school<br/>\nis not so great, but that&#39;s plenty good enough for you.&quot;  (Yuck!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she wanted to be clear and un-insulting she could have said &quot;I think<br/>\nour local school is great.&quot;  What she said wasn&#39;t that nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76707,"nextTopicId":76701}}
