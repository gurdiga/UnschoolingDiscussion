She <br/>\nannounced to her folks and to her school friends that she was a witch. The other <br/>\ngirls&#39; parents then set up a sort of united &quot;intervention&quot; and told her <br/>\nparents that no one would be allowed to talk to her anymore because she was a <br/>\ndangerous influence. Her folks were so distressed that they pulled her out of her <br/>\npublic school and enrolled her in a tiny conservative Christian school until she <br/>\nwas sufficiently back in the fold and dropped the witch identity.<br/>\n<br/>\n       It had nothing to do with television and btw, as I remember the Salem <br/>\nwitch trials --long before tv -- the horror wasn&#39;t in young girls pretending <br/>\nto be witches but the opposite. It was in their own claim to know who was holy <br/>\nand who was possessed by evil, followed by pointing fingers at other people to <br/>\nrenounce their own evil or be forcibly expelled them from the community or be <br/>\npurged by death. I&#39;d say witches and television have a lot in common as <br/>\nscapegoats for all manner of human behavior and belief. <br/>\n<br/>\n       I kept thinking that if they&#39;d focused on what was going on with their <br/>\ndaughter in the first place, rather than responding to <br/>\nwitchcraft-as-religious-trigger, it could have been better for all concerned. They compounded the <br/>\nproblem imo with their determination to make her to conform instead of <br/>\ndiscovering why she was rebelling.<br/>\n<br/>\n      What I mean is, I guess, that if I believed literally in either <br/>\nsalvation or hell and the Bible as the only thing standing between the two, I would <br/>\nchoose the approach with the strongest likelihood of permanently saving my <br/>\nchildren. Which, in my mind, would be to help build the highest possible <br/>\nindividual strength, confidence and commitment in my children, so that I know they can <br/>\nstand up for themselves and what they believe, and trust their own decisions, <br/>\nagainst anyone or anything -- I&#39;d want them to withstand peer pressure and <br/>\ninstitutional pressure rather than teach them to yield to it, for example. <br/>\n<br/>\n       And for a parent to succeed at all that takes more than not forcing <br/>\nchildren to comply, imo, it takes CELEBRATING their exploration and learning <br/>\nabout themselves and what they need and want, cheering them on as they search for <br/>\nwhat to believe and draw sustenance from their whole lives. <br/>\n<br/>\n       If my goal were to raise committed Christians, I wouldn&#39;t undermine <br/>\ntheir fledgling independent ideas or choices, or tell them what to think, or act <br/>\nin ways that make my religion or the Bible itself seem to be just glorified <br/>\npeer pressure for the purpose of keeping each other on the straight and narrow, <br/>\net cetera.<br/>\n<br/>\n       Just as I wouldn&#39;t arrange their marriages or choose their college <br/>\nmajor, I wouldn&#39;t do these things because they aren&#39;t practical, they don&#39;t get <br/>\nthe best results! They aren&#39;t well-suited to the long-term goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n       The girl is back in public school now, after she served her year in <br/>\nthe cloistered (and she says suffocating) setting. She&#39;s been allowed to join a <br/>\ncouple of theater productions with Dd (theater folk are not always exactly <br/>\n&quot;wholesome &lt;g&gt;) and also to visit some different churches with Dd and then <br/>\ndissect their differences, which they are enjoying.<br/>\n<br/>\n       I secretly wonder if the parents learned more from the whole thing <br/>\nthan their daughter did, and I kinda suspect so, but don&#39;t know for sure. Hope <br/>\nso. :) JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89415,"nextTopicId":89244}}
