Beth&#39;s thought was that all this meant was the principal was able to <br/>\nlist &quot;troublemakers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs they discussed program, Beth kept asking, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you asking these <br/>\nyouth what they want?&quot; Turned out they DO plan to ask some youth: They have <br/>\nan event for feedback planned where they&#39;ll ask Student Council president, <br/>\nKey Club president, etc....  In short, Mid- to upper-class white kids who are <br/>\nalready involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe meeting continued like this, with one guy complaining about a group of <br/>\nkids skateboarding outside the library rather than using the Skate Park.  <br/>\n(&quot;Have there been any problems?&quot; No. &quot;Any complaints from library patrons?&quot; <br/>\nNo. &quot;Anyone asked them why they prefer to skate here?&quot; Nope.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen they talked about how to &quot;authoritatively communicate with parents about <br/>\nhow to discipline and set parameters.&quot; At this point Beth (who is a very <br/>\nmellow, sweet person) told them that the parents knew their kids better than <br/>\nany of them do. Etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe suspects she won&#39;t be invited back. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe came home and said, &quot;I think unschooling has ruined me for that stuff.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nBeth was totally on board with taking Julian out of school.  Over time she&#39;s <br/>\nrid herself of her urges to make Julian do dioramas (she has a degree in <br/>\nEducation) and other &quot;educational activities.&quot; She&#39;s even stopped being <br/>\nconcerned entirely that he might not be learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think last night she became an Unschooler.
