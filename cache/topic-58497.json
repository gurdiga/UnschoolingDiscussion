An unschooling<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; conference is not one &quot;teacher&quot; in a classroom full of &quot;children&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;It was a joke.  Sorry it didn&#39;t come across that way. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat whole exchange bugged me. (In case anyone cares.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought someone jumped too hard on something that was obviously a joke.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people are touchy and that&#39;s okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t teach sewing, but I can sew.  I can help one person with one machine <br/>\n(if there&#39;s a book) but I&#39;m not good at explaining sewing.  I was doing a <br/>\npair of pants this morning with a fancy three-part gore in the crotch.  I was <br/>\ncopying a pair of pants a friend made, for medieval pants for Kirby.  I got <br/>\nreally confused at one point, because I was thinking in words.  And so I took <br/>\na deep breath, and went back to it wordlessly, and thought only in pictures <br/>\nand memories of what I know of traditional pants cuts and human movement <br/>\n(squatting and stretching and other pants-related things).  It helped, and I <br/>\ngot it to go together without a problem.  I wouldn&#39;t have been able to <br/>\nexplain it easily to someone else, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I was helping Holly with a sock monkey.  I was physically helpful, <br/>\nbut I don&#39;t have a lot of sewing-related patter to pass on, it seems, <br/>\ncompared to some other things I can talk about fairly lucidly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I go to conferences I like to hear people talk, though,  I don&#39;t mind <br/>\nhearing them answer questions, but I don&#39;t want to go to a conference to hear <br/>\neverybody else say what they think, because some of the people at conferences <br/>\nhaven&#39;t even unschooled, and so their opinions are kinda time-wasting if they <br/>\nget the mike for too long.  And if an hour of a conference is spent answering <br/>\nthings like &quot;what about socialization&quot; and &quot;how can they learn to read <br/>\nwithout phonics&quot; then those who paid money aren&#39;t getting much good <br/>\ninformation, and those asking those questions could have them answered by <br/>\njust looking around at the kids and by reading any beginning unschooling <br/>\narticle, or picking up two or three homeschooling magazines until they find <br/>\nan article on reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t love panel discussions much either, because too often it granulates <br/>\nthe information down into little reactionary bits and there&#39;s  not enough <br/>\ncohesion to get a good point.  There was an unschooling panel at last year&#39;s <br/>\nHSC conference.  There were some good moments, but overall it seemed very <br/>\ndisjoint to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year&#39;s HSC conference will be almost all panels, so those people who DO <br/>\nlove panel discussions should be in heaven!!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://conference.hsc.org/\">http://conference.hsc.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58356,"nextTopicId":58436}}
