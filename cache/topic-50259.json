(sorry, Richard, wherever you are; I don&#39;t have the <br/>\ntape in front of me to get your name right).

When you&#39;re a little more in your practice, you may say <br/>\nsomething and then realize it right away and then apologize right <br/>\naway.  And, when you&#39;re really in your practice, you catch the thing before <br/>\nit leaks out of your mouth.  Then, I think about how long I allowed Liam to <br/>\nlanguish in that school (a full year and a half of being really unhappy) <br/>\nbefore I realized that he had to be taken out that very minute.  Being <br/>\nconscious and mindful is so tricky for me!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s my long way of saying, &quot;I know what you mean, Elizabeth.&quot;  But.

However, it happens and I can<br/>\naccept it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got to go through this the easier way.  In my tiny social circle the<br/>\ngirls started excluding the boys before the boys started excluding the<br/>\ngirls.  (I have a boy and we still have mixed parties at our house<br/>\nbecause I wouldn&#39;t disinvite siblings.)  In my case the first friend who<br/>\ndropped my son out of her party had a very sensitive daughter and lived<br/>\nin a very small house.  Her previous years party had been noisy enough<br/>\nto make her cry.  It was easy to understand why she wanted to have a<br/>\nsmaller party and to leave the boys off of the list.  It&#39;s possible that<br/>\neven her brother was banished to an alternate activity that day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, once the pattern of &quot;everyone inviting everybody&quot; was broken it no<br/>\nlonger seemed very rude to leave people out.  But it would be rude to<br/>\ntalk about the party in front of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it&#39;s more of an issue for a kid that doesn&#39;t get to go to very<br/>\nmany parties.  With my attachment parenting friends all the adults tend<br/>\nto stay at the parties, too, and as far as I am concerned we go to<br/>\nplenty of parties now and I wouldn&#39;t mind cutting back a bit every year.<br/>\n (Yes, I AM the birthday Grinch.)
