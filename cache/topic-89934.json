LOL), and<br/>\nthought I would take it to heart yesterday.<br/>\n <br/>\nI went into my 12yos room and started cleaning and<br/>\norganizing his work space, where he paints his LOTR<br/>\nfigures for his gaming.<br/>\n <br/>\nI put all the figures into shoe boxes, or old gundam<br/>\nboxes, put the paints all in an empty baby wipes<br/>\nbox, the brushes in a cup, cleared off the clutter<br/>\nwithout throwing anything away that wasn&#39;t obviously<br/>\ntrash, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nI laid a big piece of red posterboard down on the<br/>\ndesk and duct-taped it down, and arranged his paints<br/>\nand brushes and put a shoe box lid down to put the<br/>\npainted figures to dry.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe came in and was so excited.  He said, &quot;Oh momma,<br/>\nthank you!  Now I just want to PAINT!&quot;  And pulled up<br/>\nhis chair, turned on one of his G.A. Henty audiobooks,<br/>\nand settled in for the afternoon.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat a great feeling!<br/>\n <br/>\nLater on, I went back up there and started really<br/>\ncleaning, and he came up and joined me and kept<br/>\nthanking me over and over for helping him clean his<br/>\nroom.  I told him he didn&#39;t have to help, that I would<br/>\ndo it just because I enjoyed it, but he loved being<br/>\nthere with me and helping so we did it together.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a a good day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n--Susan in VA<br/>\nWifetoVegman<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.
