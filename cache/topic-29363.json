I know there <br/>\nare many on this list who probably don&#39;t even know what that is, and <br/>\nthat&#39;s fine, but it is my overriding concern in deciding to take a <br/>\nhand in what&#39;s happening here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to make this a moderated list, and I deeply appreciate the <br/>\noffers from those who&#39;ve volunteered to help in that department. <br/>\nInterestingly, we&#39;ve been having something of a parallel discussion <br/>\non another list I belong to, which is directed at members of the <br/>\nindependent press, and they decided just this morning to invoke this <br/>\nmodel:<br/>\n<br/>\n...monitor the list closely and *privately* remind, reprimand, and <br/>\neventually unsubscribe members who violate the established rules <br/>\n(generally effective if done consistently, fairly, and the rest of <br/>\nthe list members let the moderators do their job instead of jumping <br/>\nimmediately on someone who missteps).<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the way that is worded, even if I don&#39;t like the idea of <br/>\nlist-police. But just as society in general needs police to keep the <br/>\nhooligans from making life miserable for everyone, I guess lists with <br/>\nas diverse a populace as this one enjoys will benefit from someone <br/>\nkeeping the problems in check.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how do we come up with acceptable rules of behavior? I&#39;ve seen <br/>\nsome good ones on other lists... FWIW, the independent press list I&#39;m <br/>\non came up with waaaay too many rules for me - I can live with them <br/>\nunder my other hat as a publisher, but not as an unschooling mom. I <br/>\nthink the simpler we keep things the simpler it will be for people to <br/>\nremember and comply with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m open to suggestions in that department.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I&#39;ll reply to a few posts individually.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":55326806,"authorName":"rumpleteasermom","from":"&quot;rumpleteasermom&quot; &lt;rumpleteasermom@...&gt;","profile":"rumpleteasermom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Hey, list...","postDate":"1007671022","msgId":29455,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDl1b2t0ZSszZGQ4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAxMTIwNjExMTgxOS4wMGEwNDYxMEBtYWlsLmlzbGFuZG5ldC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":29450,"nextInTopic":29466,"prevInTime":29454,"nextInTime":29456,"topicId":29363,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... bringing ... long?

Where does the time go?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I, too, am growing tired of the continued bad vibes I&#39;m getting from<br/>\n&gt; certain people on this list. I&#39;ve been watching the membership list<br/>\n&gt; dwindle as people either unsub or set their subs to no mail in<br/>\n&gt; increasing numbers. It saddens me to see what was once such a<br/>\n&gt; friendly, helpful vibrant list become this sad shell of its former<br/>\n&gt; self. And I&#39;m not amused by the increasing frequency of foul language<br/>\n&gt; in posts. No, we don&#39;t monitor or police this list. We&#39;re not going<br/>\n&gt; to unsub you for expressing yourself in flaming fullcolor. We rather<br/>\n&gt; expect that you&#39;d behave less like an angst-filled teenager - no,<br/>\n&gt; waitaminute, that&#39;s not fair to teenagers... sorry. Anyway, you get<br/>\n&gt; my drift. I&#39;m sure we can all click on the latest junk email if we<br/>\n&gt; want titilating language.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So what do we do with this problem child of a list? I received an<br/>\n&gt; emailing offlist tonight from a friend expressing outrage that this<br/>\n&gt; list&#39;s behavior is reflecting badly on HEM&#39;s reputation (it is one of<br/>\n&gt; ours, after all). I could only shake my head and agree with her<br/>\n&gt; analysis, but how do we keep this list free and open and unmonitored<br/>\n&gt; if people are just going to continue to behave like they&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; doing for - gee, how long has it been now? Too long in my estimation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I keep wondering if we passed some kind of invisible balance point<br/>\n&gt; with this list some time ago; let things slide too far in one<br/>\n&gt; direction and now there&#39;s no way to find our way back to what we once<br/>\n&gt; had. When I started this list I was so sure it didn&#39;t need monitors<br/>\n&gt; and listmamas because surely unschoolers were &quot;different,&quot; they could<br/>\n&gt; find and maintain balance and kindness and a higher purpose, couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; they?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Quite a few people have asked for a return to peaceful discourse,<br/>\n&gt; most of them much more eloquently than I feel capable of. To be<br/>\n&gt; honest, I&#39;m still feeling pretty burned out by everything that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; happened this fall - it&#39;s been a rough one for our family, as well as<br/>\n&gt; for our nation. That just makes it so much harder to come here - to<br/>\n&gt; what was for so long a friendly port in life&#39;s storms - and find such<br/>\n&gt; animosity and orneryness every day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So maybe this great unmonitored experiment of a list has failed,<br/>\n&gt; after all.

When I started this list I was so sure it didn&#39;t need monitors <br/>\nand listmamas because surely unschoolers were &quot;different,&quot; they could <br/>\nfind and maintain balance and kindness and a higher purpose, couldn&#39;t <br/>\nthey?<br/>\n<br/>\nQuite a few people have asked for a return to peaceful discourse, <br/>\nmost of them much more eloquently than I feel capable of. To be <br/>\nhonest, I&#39;m still feeling pretty burned out by everything that&#39;s <br/>\nhappened this fall - it&#39;s been a rough one for our family, as well as <br/>\nfor our nation. That just makes it so much harder to come here - to <br/>\nwhat was for so long a friendly port in life&#39;s storms - and find such <br/>\nanimosity and orneryness every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe this great unmonitored experiment of a list has failed, <br/>\nafter all. What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5110492,"authorName":"Ned","from":"Ned &lt;les.carlson2@...&gt;","profile":"lmncarlson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Guilty schoolers","postDate":"1007557211","msgId":29363,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDMEUxQTVCLjVCMjQ0M0I0QHN5bXBhdGljby5jYT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwMDc1MTMwMzAuMjEyOS45NTMyLm05QHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":29423,"prevInTime":29362,"nextInTime":29364,"topicId":29363,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It seems to me that defensiveness comes from inside the person who&#39;s being defensive.  If I feel confident about a decision I&#39;ve made, you can say just about anything to me about it and I won&#39;t react defensively.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Not the first time this has happened, of course. Just the most<br/>\n&gt; recent. I&#39;m sure many of you have run into this odd phenomenon of<br/>\n&gt; people reacting as though homeschooling were something they felt<br/>\n&gt; guilty about if they weren&#39;t doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We chose to send our son to school for grade 5 and part of grade 6 so that I could work.  He didn&#39;t yet feel confident about staying home by himself, we needed the money and I failed to come up with a way to earn it at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t want to go.  It was fairly unpleasant for all of us. I felt, and continue to feel, huge waves of guilt about it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI  wish that we&#39;d been able to find a better way to get through those years.  I feel guilt about his unpleasant experience, about the loss of trust between us, about not being able to come up with a way of earning a hunk of money working at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read about your experience, what I think I recognized was the guilt of the working mother (which happens even with mothers who happily send their kids to school), compounded with the guilt of someone who feels she hasn&#39;t made the best decision about a huge chunk of her<br/>\nchildren&#39;s lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I hadn&#39;t given the whole thing<br/>\n&gt; much thought until yesterday, but this lady&#39;s intensity...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that the lady&#39;s intensity had more to do with her own inner conflict than anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*                 *                  *                    *<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ...has been<br/>\n&gt; making me wonder whether or not it&#39;s a good thing that homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; is perceived as so... I dunno... wholesome? Unimpeachable? (Where&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; that damn thesaurus when I need it? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Helen, I&#39;m interested in hearing some ways that you think it&#39;s a &quot;bad&quot; thing if people perceive homeschooling is &quot;the best&quot; ( I&#39;ll use it as a weak  stand-in for wholesome, unimpeachable, or ...?....).<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it something about people seeing us (the parents) as paragons of virtue and eyeballing us for signs of weakness and speaking to us from a kind of defensive, guilty, intense place because we&#39;re these paragons?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy immediate reaction was that you meant something about people deciding that their families aren&#39;t good enough for them to plunge into homeschooling.   Or that they&#39;ll feel the kind of guilt that this lady seems to feel. Or just that they feel that deciding to homeschool is some<br/>\nkind of irrevocable decision that they&#39;re not strong enough to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nWouldn&#39;t it be a happier society if people just felt easy enough in themselves (and had the means) to do what they feel is right, and weren&#39;t expending so much energy flogging themselves because they aren&#39;t doing  &quot;the best thing&quot;? Or if we could just stop comparing ourselves to<br/>\nother people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nanother Joan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29754,"nextTopicId":29715}}
