I wasn&#39;t talking about you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy comment **sometimes when brand new homeschoolers join the group** was<br/>\nabout my support group in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had people that I provided a lot of information to, turn and sniff<br/>\ndisdainfully, as if they were unhappy that I didn&#39;t give them a complete<br/>\nand perfect prescription for their children and their situation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKeeping with the cooking analogy, I can give people fruit from my tree,<br/>\nI can share groceries with them and tell them my favorite places to<br/>\nshop, but I am not gonna plan all their meals for the week and cook them<br/>\nfor them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that&#39;s clearer.  I know analogies are kind of an imperfect way to<br/>\nexpress ideas, but I like them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy <br/>\n<br/>\nPS  I think some people, who&#39;ve had kids in school, are used to only<br/>\nmaking one decision &quot;what school should my child attend&quot; and they are<br/>\nlooking for a one decision answer regarding homeschooling.  They&#39;re<br/>\nlooking for what engineers call a &quot;turnkey solution&quot;.  They seem to be<br/>\nvery uncomfortable with choices and look like they are looking for a<br/>\npath that doesn&#39;t involve making choices.  Unschooling isn&#39;t that path.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**&gt; Me, too!
