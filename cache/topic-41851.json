Like it or not, the fact remains that many <br/>\nunschoolers are affected by indirect association with public schools. Some <br/>\nhave been extremely wounded by having had their children in those schools and <br/>\nneed to vent and go through the process of working it out of their systems. <br/>\nOthers are affected by friends, neighbors, and relatives who are sold on the <br/>\nschool system. Many of these people (myself included) feel empowered by <br/>\n&quot;rantings&quot; such as Ned&#39;s, after having been beaten down by the system and <br/>\nbaffled as to how to deal with its pervasiveness. I would think that a <br/>\nfeeling of empowerment will give these people the courage to go with the idea <br/>\nof unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that a few of the long time regular posters are resentful that <br/>\nsomeone new to the list has so much to say of interest, and is stealing their <br/>\nthunder. As long as people are not profane or extremely vulgar, I wish you&#39;d <br/>\nget off their backs and stop trying to CONTROL everything they say. I keep <br/>\nhearing unschoolers talk about trusting your children to run with their <br/>\nideas, and then you turn around and try to squash every idea posted that you <br/>\ndisagree with.
