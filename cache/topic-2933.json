They&#39;ve all learned <br/>\ntheir skills on the job, getting paid as they went, and whenever one <br/>\nhas decided to try something new they&#39;ve been enticed to stay on with <br/>\nraises in pay and other perks and promised a job there again if they <br/>\never want to return. Sometimes they&#39;ve taken a drop in pay to follow <br/>\nan interest, like our 26 yo son Jim, who decided he was tired of <br/>\nbeing an electrician for high $$ and wanted to see some more of the <br/>\ncountry... So he took a six-week course in truck driving (while <br/>\nworking as an electrician) and has been trucking all across the <br/>\nwestern states since last September, driving an 18-wheeler and just <br/>\nloving it! He&#39;ll have enough experience by next month to be able to <br/>\ntake his wife and two little girls with him - I can just hear the <br/>\nexcitement in their voices when we talk on the phone these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s something unschooling does for kids - it allows them <br/>\nto look at things a little differently and not be afraid to change <br/>\nsomething that&#39;s not necessarily working for them. It was a serious <br/>\nswitch for Jim to leave his high-paying electrician&#39;s job, because <br/>\nthey&#39;d just bought ten acres with a house and barn last summer. But <br/>\nhe&#39;d always dreamed of driving big rigs, and his wife encouraged him <br/>\nto follow his dream, taking a job to help make ends meet until Jim <br/>\ngot his first trucking checks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of our kids have said they&#39;re just collecting skills, exploring <br/>\navenues, figuring some day they&#39;ll start their own businesses and run <br/>\nthings their own way. They see jobs as pretty much a means to an end, <br/>\npaying the bills while learning things and meeting people, while <br/>\nrunning one&#39;s own business (as they&#39;ve always seen their parents do) <br/>\nis the best way to really get ahead. But they&#39;re all aware that <br/>\nrunning one&#39;s own business is a *major* commitment, so none of them <br/>\nare ready to take that leap just yet. They&#39;re all still exploring the <br/>\noptions, checking out the territory, unschooling (unjobbing?) <br/>\nthemselves. (Is this the list we discussed the unjobbing book on a <br/>\ncouple of weeks ago, or was that our other unschooling list?)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn contrast, several of the kids our kids grew up with are taking the <br/>\ncollege route, and our kids are appalled at the financial burdens <br/>\nthey&#39;re starting out with. When they come to visit it&#39;s usually a <br/>\nprimary topic of conversation: &quot;Well, I&#39;m almost through school and <br/>\nnow I need to find a good job to start paying off the debt...&quot; One <br/>\ngirl says she&#39;s planning to just stay in college forever because she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t think she could ever pay off the bills if she left. I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure how that works - you don&#39;t start paying &#39;til you get out? Some <br/>\nof the kids&#39; friends have received scholarships, but as one friend of <br/>\nour daughter said recently - if I&#39;d known how little that big <br/>\nfancy-sounding scholarship would really cover I&#39;d have run the other <br/>\ndirection!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course yours truly was unschooled, but that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother <br/>\nstory, which is probably somewhere in this list&#39;s archives anyway. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"OT  Webdesign help!","postDate":"1041797309","msgId":53185,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBM0RGQUVELjExNjkzJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1LjY0Yjg0OGEuMmI0OWM4N2NAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":53171,"nextInTopic":53204,"prevInTime":53184,"nextInTime":53186,"topicId":2933,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m looking for good examples of java menus.

Welcome to the list.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe started homeschooling when my middle son was 11.  We quickly grew into <br/>\nunschooling.  He deschooled for a couple of years, but he was never inactive. <br/>\n He played a lot of video and computer games, learned some programming, built <br/>\nstuff with Legos and Mindstorms, and enjoyed the internet.  At 14 he learned <br/>\nto drive and also took philosophy at the local vo-tech college.  At 15 we <br/>\nmoved to a location where he could more easily get to work without a car, and <br/>\nhe began working.  First in fast food restaurants, becoming a shift leader <br/>\nand getting lots of hours, and then at 17 he went to work full-time at an <br/>\nadult-type job, building electrical panels.  While he was doing that, he got <br/>\na car and a part-time job in a retail clothing store.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere in there he moved in with his dad and went back to public school.  <br/>\nSometimes it is hard to find other homeschooled teenagers who won&#39;t be more <br/>\nworried about what church you attend than what kind of person you are.  So, <br/>\nhe needed some friends and he got a lot of them. I posted on his experiences <br/>\nthere just yesterday, so I won&#39;t go into it.  But he came home again for the <br/>\nsame reasons he left the first time.  It&#39;s *school*.  @@<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, he quit his full-time job last August because he realized he was only <br/>\n17 and working two jobs and he felt he was wasting his &quot;childhood&quot;.  Since <br/>\nthen he has pursued his dream of becoming a rock star, and actually is in a <br/>\nband that has concerts and a website and recently recorded a demo. ( &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.essex.cjb.net&quot;&gt;<br/>\nhttp://www.essex.cjb.net&lt;/A&gt; That&#39;s him on the opening screen with the pink hair <br/>\nand orange shirt.)  He&#39;s 18, now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this is not what I would have envisioned for him when he was 11.  But <br/>\nunschooling taught me to see that what I want for him is not important.  I <br/>\nshudder to think what things might have been like if he had been further <br/>\nrepressed in school like he was.  I was taking him to therapy for depression <br/>\nwhen he was SEVEN, for cryin-out-loud.  Directly related to school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour son *will* break out on his own, but it is very likely it won&#39;t look <br/>\nlike anything you could have imagined.  You will do much better just being in <br/>\nthe relationship with him, and knowing him and loving him as he changes, and <br/>\nhe knowing you and loving you as you change.  Relationship is the thing many <br/>\npeople discount or leave out of unschooling when they describe it.  But to <br/>\nme, it&#39;s the one necessary element.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59689617,"authorName":"rhonda_burkhardt &lt;rhonda_b66@hotmail.com&gt;","from":"&quot;rhonda_burkhardt &lt;rhonda_b66@...&gt;&quot; &lt;rhonda_b66@...&gt;","profile":"rhonda_burkhardt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"New to the list","postDate":"1041786576","msgId":53159,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGF2OW9zZytvYzFtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26579,"nextInTopic":53164,"prevInTime":53158,"nextInTime":53160,"topicId":2933,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, my name is Rhonda.

I have one\nthat I know from personal experience, where the 3 kids have turned out\nvariously illiterate, totally lacking in self esteem, a bully and a thief.\nTheir mother was into John Holt and unschooling from the time the eldest\nwas a baby.\n<p>But you see it&#39;s all a matter of definition, and IMO she didn&#39;t understand\nwhat unschooling was all about. For example, when her daughter wanted to\nattend a gym class instead of just the play-around-with-the-equipment session,\nbecause she wanted to learn how to do things properly, she was told no.\nWhen one wanted to learn to read it was told no. And so on. This woman\nthought unschooling was taking your kids to lots of places, having lots\nof toys, books, etc - offering an enriched environment - but NEVER teaching\nthem anything, because teaching is the root of all evil. And to her, responding\nto a child asking &#39;what does this word say?&#39;, was teaching, so she wouldn&#39;t\ndo it. IMO this was neglect, not unschooling.\n<p>In my experience, some kids thrive on structure - I have one like that.\nI am trying to help him find his own ways of structuring his life. He loves\nworkbooks - discovered them through another homeschooler and begged for\nthem for his birthday! He likes to have a schedule printed up of all our\ncommitments, so he can work out times to do his maths, music practise etc.\nMy husband taught him to use MS Projects or some such thing so he could\ntimetable his day! But this isn&#39;t forcing anything on him, it&#39;s enabling\nhim to live how he likes, within a disorganised family &lt;g&gt; Others thrive\non serendipity, and going with the flow.\n<p>On a more subtle level, and this is the level I&#39;m still at :-(&nbsp;&nbsp;\nif you don&#39;t believe in unschooling in your gut and in your head and in\nyour whole being you will run into some problems. The kids will sense that\nyou don&#39;t totally trust them, that you have things you believe are more\nimportant than what they want to do, that you have expectations.\n<p>The more you can trust them, the more successful unschooling will be.\nIf you can&#39;t trust totally, then I think that the next best thing is to\nbe honest with your kids about what is happening - at the same time as\nstriving towards fixing up your own head! That&#39;s where I&#39;m at: I keep trying,\nbut I&#39;m open with the kids about why I appear contradictory - it&#39;s because\nof my past, not because of their present and future.\n<p>Unschooling is to do with the environment the kids live in. You can&#39;t\nunschool successfully as a method. You need to provide an environment rich\nin opportunity, experiences and, most essentially, trust.\n<p>Carol\n<br>in New Zealand\n<br>&nbsp;\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote TYPE=\"CITE\"><font size=\"-1\">I&#39;m just wondering, have you ever known\nanyone whom unschooling did not work for??&nbsp; Are there any tales of\ntradgedy?&nbsp; I&#39;m sure there are tales like that no matter what educational\nmethod you choose, I&#39;m just wondering how one prevents such a tragedy with\nunschooling.</font></blockquote>\n\n \n</span></blockquote></p></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day","from":"&quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ZfaAIxockbsjtIanv5TKZxjM7H9FThf5NyAQ5d9KeCeth7_AUe3GTRKZFvZSPU_6aQjP_cmYTUYDafa5SOnIa9FLUFXs1Np396pVw1SNJQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"New to the list","postDate":"954873327","msgId":7704,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZDEwMWJmOWU2NCQ4Y2U4MGY4MCRiOGRmMDNkMEBrcmlzdGVucz4="},"prevInTopic":5718,"nextInTopic":7717,"prevInTime":7703,"nextInTime":7705,"topicId":2933,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I m not totally new, I was on this list before, but after a year of homeschooling, I m taking a nother look at unschooling.

I<br/>\ndid need the time away from my kids for personal time as their birth<br/>\nexperiences were so traumatic and their early years were hard for a variety<br/>\nof reasons can barely speak about it suffice it to say that they are both<br/>\nlucky to be alive and my first  pregnancy was identical twins and my first<br/>\nborn died at birth, so I decided from that experience that staying home and<br/>\nraising my babies was the most important thing I could do and had no desire<br/>\nto return to teaching. I live in New Hampshire whose motto&quot;live free or die&quot;<br/>\napplies to everyone (it seems)  but homeschoolers although it is much more<br/>\ncommon here.<br/>\nparents do have to write a yearly curriculum and have it approved by the<br/>\nSuperintendent. If anyone else here is from NH please let me know I am<br/>\ninterested in how you did it. Because these authority figures represent my<br/>\nboss and all the narrow minded politicians in the world I am scared to death<br/>\nof the homeschooling process as well as taking the kids out of school. I<br/>\nknow I can do this (I am and was a teacher) but I don&#39;t want to be a slave<br/>\nor live in fear that they will give me a hard time taking the kids out of<br/>\nschool next year. Lately, I have entertained the idea of just lying and<br/>\nsaying we are moving but it is too small a town. I read some posts of<br/>\nsomeone who wants to move back to City life ( I can relate) and I&#39;ve also<br/>\nbeen the mom who went to the library story times in more than one town. Of<br/>\ncourse I hated some of them but now and then the librarian would take off<br/>\nher shoes put on her guitar and we&#39;d all go outside and sing. The other town<br/>\nlibrary was so laid back they would also have an art activity and a snack<br/>\ntime and all the moms hung out. I didn&#39;t go too much just when I needed a<br/>\nbreak from out tiny apt. now we also live in a bigger space and none of the<br/>\nneighbors here home school. I realize being a teacher is politically correct<br/>\nfor doing it (it is just I am so against those curricula I&#39;d have to create<br/>\nwhich I&#39;d be so good at if I didn&#39;t feel so afraid.) I think my biggest fear<br/>\nis that my kids will hate being home with me and beg me to send them back to<br/>\nschool! It hasn&#39;t happened to me over the summer or when they are on<br/>\nvacation<br/>\nor when they are home sick. Anyway, I know I am rambling but did want to let<br/>\nyou all know my fears and that I am also happy to be here seeing how you all<br/>\nare doing it and enjoying reading your topics and honesty about the<br/>\nprejudice you encounter.And what to say on the playground I really got a<br/>\nkick out of the one about taking a recess it is so true all kids need a good<br/>\nlong recess outside at a playground! Even though moving near a city is<br/>\ntempting I think the prejudice is even greater there as people near cities<br/>\ntend to think their ps district is the best and up here no one blames you!<br/>\nI&#39;d sure love to hear from anyone who has taken their kids out of school and<br/>\nhow hard it was and any thing you&#39;d like to share and if they have more than<br/>\none child how they can afford to have the adventures and stuff that keep<br/>\nlife from getting too boring. My dream is to take a cross country trip with<br/>\nthe kids and study nature and different coastal  environments travel the<br/>\nentire Atlantic seaboard and end up in the Florida Keys . I think I&#39;d have<br/>\nto sell my house first and am not quite ready to do that yet. I was lucky<br/>\nenough to go to a High school that did have a program like that. I learned<br/>\nto ski and camp (things my parents never did). I know my good educational<br/>\nexperiences can help my hs experience with my kids and I know I will also<br/>\nrelax once I have taken the plunge and this getting ready to do it is the<br/>\nhardest part of all. I am meeting a hs mom up here whose son is my<br/>\ndaughter&#39;s age and never been to ps school. I imagine it is easier if you&#39;ve<br/>\nnever gone but I may be wrong!<br/>\nBeth</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Thomas and Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Thomas and Nanci Kuykendall &lt;tn-k4of5@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"juZvgMI_wcVbu9iJaiv12K_Cqxs4pcLKDz8r7hqTq1ZMk6A7Pq5PXv3EPbPv9-lRuCXN1AsLEepKawB64j1jBJZkdj1w1o1KdBQWWwOrbUUsPN1pIgNDGG0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: New to the list","postDate":"937666165","msgId":3024,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMTEuMzAyNC45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3007,"nextInTopic":5718,"prevInTime":3023,"nextInTime":3025,"topicId":2933,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

(sorry, but comes from the recognition that so<br/>\nmany of us have had that the school is not -- and doesn&#39;t envision<br/>\nitself as -- a helping organization.

My other two kids are doing good in<br/>\n&gt; school<br/>\n&gt; so I will leave them there for this year but my daughter has told me<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;d like to be homeschooled next year.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Beware!  Those who do &quot;well&quot; in school are those most likely to become<br/>\nlearning dependent -- in my experience, it is the so-called &quot;good<br/>\nstudent&quot; who gets damaged most (and don&#39;t realize it until it is too<br/>\nlate.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Already I have some people telling me how they&#39;ll miss out on the<br/>\n&gt; social<br/>\n&gt; aspect of school and how tough it will be for me to do this.

I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; worried about<br/>\n&gt; &quot;teaching&quot; them because once I sat down to think about lessons I<br/>\n&gt; realized<br/>\n&gt; that there are a lot of lessons just waiting to be taught right here<br/>\n&gt; around<br/>\n&gt; the house.

I live in Southern <br/>\nCalifornia, the desert portion and oh is it ever hot today!  I am 31 yrs old, <br/>\nmom of three kids ages 6, almost 9 and a 10 yr old.  I&#39;m seriously looking to <br/>\nhome school the 8 yr old who is behind in school and can&#39;t seem to catch up.  <br/>\nHe is a visual learner which isn&#39;t always the way teachers teach in schools.  <br/>\nThe year has just begun and already I&#39;m at wits end.  I talked to his teacher <br/>\nlast week and voiced my concerns and her comments were &quot;Well, he isn&#39;t the <br/>\nlowest in the class and you can always retain him next year.&quot;  Sheesh, that <br/>\ndidn&#39;t fill me with a lot of hope.  The school has decided he compensates so <br/>\nqualifies for no extra help though he is 2 grade levels behind.  I guess you <br/>\nhave to be 3 or 4 grade levels behind to get help around there which just <br/>\ndoes not make sense to me.  So last week I started making calls for <br/>\ninformation on homeschooling.  Our little ol&#39; district has no Independent <br/>\nStudy Program unless the kdis are sick and that only lasts for 6 weeks max so <br/>\nI have to declare my home as a private school.  I am waiting for the R4 to be <br/>\nmailed and that&#39;s where I am now.  My other two kids are doing good in school <br/>\nso I will leave them there for this year but my daughter has told me that <br/>\nshe&#39;d like to be homeschooled next year.  <br/>\n  Already I have some people telling me how they&#39;ll miss out on the social <br/>\naspect of school and how tough it will be for me to do this.  I doubt my son <br/>\nwill miss much socially since he plays sports thru the city programs and goes <br/>\nto the recreation center too.  That hardly worries me.  I&#39;m not worried about <br/>\n&quot;teaching&quot; them because once I sat down to think about lessons I realized <br/>\nthat there are a lot of lessons just waiting to be taught right here around <br/>\nthe house.  He&#39;ll have opportunities right here that the school could never <br/>\nprovide.  So I am optimistic.  I&#39;m going to hang around here for bit, if you <br/>\nall don&#39;t mind, and learn from you too.  <br/>\n  My dad always hollered after me every morning on my way out to school, <br/>\n&quot;Learn things!&quot;  It became a joke and I&#39;d tell him the same thing when he <br/>\nwent to school for work.  Now it has become a motto of sorts... we never stop <br/>\nlearning.  I enjoy learning and want my son to enjoy it too, not dread it.  <br/>\n  Well that was a little longer than I expected it to be.  :-)   I look <br/>\nforward to getting know everyone.<br/>\nSmiles,<br/>\nChelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109179,"nextTopicId":109257}}
