So, I was looking for<br/>\n&gt;something fun for us to do today without getting too wet, and I was going<br/>\n&gt;through my bookmarks to see if I could scare up something interesting.  I<br/>\n&gt;was looking in a group I entitled &quot;Things We Can Build&quot; and I rediscovered<br/>\n&gt;this website.  With all the recent talk about geodesic domes, and after the<br/>\n&gt;fun time we had building a newspaper dome at the conference last weekend, I<br/>\n&gt;thought I&#39;d pass this along for anyone who would like to build  a more<br/>\n&gt;permanent geodesic dome playhouse.  Consider this:  you could also make the<br/>\n&gt;upper sheathing out of  plexiglas or lexan (sp?) and build an 8-foot<br/>\n&gt;greenhouse (oh boy!!).  Here&#39;s the link for the plans, which cost $29.95:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://david.martiniii.tripod.com/play_dome.htm\">http://david.martiniii.tripod.com/play_dome.htm</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Of course, now that I think of it, the Desert Domes website has the same<br/>\n&gt;kind of information available for free.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.desertdomes.com/\">http://www.desertdomes.com/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There you have it!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Marji<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_____________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46668,"nextTopicId":46719}}
