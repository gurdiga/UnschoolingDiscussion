It&#39;s usually the  <br/>\nsame<br/>\nstory my older son picks on the younger one until he gets mad and<br/>\npounces on his brother. It doesn&#39;t seem that anything we try is<br/>\nworking. Today the older one woke up with a black eye and scratches<br/>\nall over his face which was the result of Starwars play gone bad.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your child had a black eye and scratches on his face but he didn&#39;t  <br/>\nhave a sibling, would you still blame Starwars?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you let a neighbor do that to him?  A stranger?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the older one is picking on the younger one, intervene in some  <br/>\nsubtle way.  Separate them without them feeling like mom stepped in  <br/>\nand separated them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might call the older one away (with a nice voice) and ask him to  <br/>\nhelp you do something really brief, like give the dog water, or take  <br/>\na bag of trash out--something that makes him feel bigger, not  <br/>\nsmaller.  It might be all the time he needs to calm down, and if it  <br/>\ninvolves physical activity it will help him breath a bit and see a  <br/>\ndifferent scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t konw what you&#39;ve tried so far, but each of your children  <br/>\nneeds to feel safe in his own home, and &quot;letting them work it out&quot; is  <br/>\ncruel, even if nobody&#39;s getting a black eye.  There are deeper scars  <br/>\nthan bruises that some people carry through life because of things  <br/>\nsiblings said or did, while the parents didn&#39;t even know.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some ideas I&#39;ve used with my three kids, who are 2.5 and 3  <br/>\nyears apart:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/peace/fighting\">http://sandradodd.com/peace/fighting</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110793,"nextTopicId":110800}}
