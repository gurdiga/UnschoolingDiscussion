I can clearly see all sides to this particular discussion, and I am<br/>\n&gt; so glad it has continued.  Although the subject may be uncomfortable, I<br/>\n&gt; think everyone seems to agree that it is one of most importantance .  It<br/>\n&gt; seems to be making some progress though, where people are starting to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>listen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and therefore actually be able to affect one another.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think compassion is the key here.  I read Corallyn&#39;s initial post as<br/>\n </span></blockquote>being<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; brave & quite worthy of  responses.  It is very difficult to bring up the<br/>\n&gt; discussion of discipline, and it touches on very sensitive ground for most<br/>\n&gt; of us.  But, the only way to effectively change often involves some<br/>\n&gt; discomfort.  I am always grateful to those who are braver than I at<br/>\n&gt; broaching &#39;dangerous&#39; subjects, and I always learn something no matter how<br/>\n&gt; much I already think I know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, thank you to Corallyn & thank you to Nicoletta ( I appreciated both of<br/>\n&gt; your posts), and thank you to everyone else who contributed to the<br/>\n&gt; discussion one way or the other.  I&#39;ve been on lists where discussion was<br/>\n&gt; shut down when things got even slightly controversial, and that level of<br/>\n&gt; censorship doesn&#39;t seem to reflect the ideas of unschooling in my mind<br/>\n&gt; anyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I look forward to many more discussions with all of you!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cindy<br/>\n&gt; St. Louis, MO<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Shannon Nicoletta Manns&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snmanns@...\">snmanns@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, September 03, 2000 8:29 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Differences with DH<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With all this said I do respect each  person&#39;s right to their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; oppinion. That doesn&#39;t mean I do/have to agree/like that opinion.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Corallyn<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s right, Corallyn.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; BTW I did some spanking when my girls where younger, before I knew about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Aletha Solter&#39;s work and before I joined a Self-Healing Circle.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I wasn&#39;t judging you personally. However I still believe that spanking<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; abusive. Therefore I have to admit that &quot;I used to abuse my children&quot;. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have changed.

Corporal punishment is<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the only type of child abuse - a lot of emotional abuse goes unnoticed.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; have been &quot;guilty&quot; of that, too. Realizing that my behaviours originated<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my own childhood is not an excuse or a reason to blame my upbringing,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; place to begin changing. I am working on it every day.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So I would like to join someone else here who said &quot;try not to take it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; personally&quot;. I know that is not easy sometimes, and I see every day how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &#39;taking things personally and getting defensive&#39; gets in way more than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything when it comes to opening up to change.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I thank you, Corallyn, for posting you original message. In my<br/>\n&gt; emotionality<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was maybe too quick to react by sending all the Aletha Solter info (I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; still think everyone could benefit from knowing her stuff), without<br/>\n&gt; &gt; acknowledging that I have been where you are, Corallyn, and I do have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sympathy for you and your situation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My husband and I recently joined a Couples&#39; Self-Healing Circle. It has<br/>\n&gt; been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most valuable in helping us deal with some of our issues - differences<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; childrearing being one, especially since we are blended family (I have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>two<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; girls from a previous marriage, he has a son and a daughter from two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; previous marriages and together we have Benjamin who is three).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, I apologize for not being more sensitive to begin with.
