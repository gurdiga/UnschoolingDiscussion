It&#39;s fitted with front n rear panniers and fenders and lights. Has the drop road handlebars too. Wider tyres.<br/>\nThey are 700x32.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Lycra set I mean them people who think what you wear is the most important part of cycling and are poseurs. Those are the ones who would never help you fix a flat and they sneer at me with my bike<br/>\nfestooned with bungee cords and stuff. I even bungee my walking stick onto my bike so I can hobble round the supermarket at the other end of the journey ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned that bikes don&#39;t fit in suitcases today :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nReally really must pack for this trip....<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley the procrastinator<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Distance","postDate":"1051728757","msgId":66882,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjMC44ZTI1NGQxLjJiZTE3NTc1QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":66907,"prevInTime":66881,"nextInTime":66883,"topicId":66882,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/30/03 9:51:21 AM Central Daylight Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1599768060\">In a message dated 4/30/03 9:51:21 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  He nearly gave himself a hernia trying to pass me on my laden bike and <br/>\nnormal everyday clothes.
