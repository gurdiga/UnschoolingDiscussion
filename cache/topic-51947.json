Cameron&#39;s friends are the pricey private schoolers too! &lt;G&gt; But <br/>\nthings are just TOO conservative here in Columbia, SC. The kids SEEM to have <br/>\nfreedom, but they don&#39;t. Not at all. Some of the parents are oblivious to <br/>\nwhat&#39;s going on (and the kids encourage that by misleading the parents). The <br/>\n&quot;freedom&quot; (in quotes&lt;g&gt;) is hardly what the parents THINK they&#39;re giving. The <br/>\nkids are TAKING their own freedoms without &quot;permission&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy niece (at 18) got a tattoo. The Chinese characters for &quot;love&quot; and &quot;joy&quot; <br/>\ndown her back (Last name&#39;s Lovejoy). She was supposed to get a car to take to <br/>\ncollege. The parents refused to get the car she had been promised because of <br/>\nthe tattoo. They didn&#39;t learn of the tongue piercing &#39;til MUCH later! &lt;G&gt;  <br/>\nScrewy in-laws!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: UNSCHOOLING!

Most of these parents have no clue what <br/>\ntheir kids are doing and who they are with. Kids are actually taking drugs <br/>\nduring class.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I digress. I would say at least half of the kids in that school, if <br/>\nnot more have piercings and tattoos. Their parents have no problem with it, <br/>\nnot saying I do, just that their meaning behind it is different than mine <br/>\nwould be.<br/>\n<br/>\nTara has each ear done 3 times and her bellybutton pierced.  She wants a <br/>\ntattoo but I had to crusade way too hard with her dad for the bellybutton <br/>\nring to let that happen. He&#39;d go ballistic on me if I even mentioned tattoo. <br/>\nHe thinks I let Tara &quot;get away&quot; with way too much.
