Alot. But not<br/>\nenough to keep up with all the ideas and characters<br/>\nand stories in my head. :) My latest pursuit that I&#39;m<br/>\ndetermined to actually FINISH (I usually don&#39;t finish<br/>\nthem, cuz a short story feels like I&#39;m leaving<br/>\neverything else that happens later out, and a novel<br/>\njust doesn&#39;t ever end. :)...) is about a girl named<br/>\nNari. It&#39;s kind of a odd mix of fantasy (as in<br/>\nfaeries, elves, etc...and involving characters that<br/>\nI&#39;ve been writing about for years and years now),<br/>\nscience fiction, adventure, cyberpunk, and nonsense.<br/>\nWho knows how it will turn out. But I am determined it<br/>\nWILL end up being a complete &quot;project&quot;, that hopefully<br/>\nmaye someday will be published. I usually don&#39;t think<br/>\nin those terms, but I&#39;ve been lately looking into alot<br/>\nof different mags that accept unsolicited work<br/>\n(fiction&#39;s really more my bag, I&#39;ve decided) and<br/>\nmaking myself have a nice little free-writing time<br/>\nevery day. I&#39;ve never been much for journaling in the<br/>\nsense of writing personal stuff down, but my free<br/>\nwriting notebook is kind of like a journal to me. <br/>\nThanks for asking, though. Love to talk about writing,<br/>\nI do. :)<br/>\n-Bobbie <br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:noni411@...\">noni411@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 4/4/1 2:50:44 AM,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I was not as<br/>\n&gt; troubled as I seemed, but I tend to get carried away<br/>\n&gt; when writing about...anything. :)<br/>\n&gt; Thanks, again.
