It&#39;s fresh, so maybe your <br/>\nMom just needs time to adjust.  I understand how she feels from where she <br/>\nsits, but she seems to be ignoring how unhappy your sister is in school.  <br/>\nMaybe encouraging community college classes is the way to go since mom liked <br/>\nthat idea??  She could always try it out over the summer when ps is out and <br/>\nmaybe that will help sway your mom?  Gee, I&#39;m sorry because this must be vey <br/>\nhard for everyone involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck!<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67405,"nextTopicId":66559}}
