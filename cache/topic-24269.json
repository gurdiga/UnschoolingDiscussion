Thank you for sharing that with us! We go thru the same stuff at our house to, Chores....yelling at them to get them done!(gasp!) It seems endless! I have felt the same things you talked about.....always learning it nevers stops!! Sometimes our kids are great teachers!!<br/>\n We just cleaned out our garage yesterday...what a job!! But we all feel better about working together to get it done! I think thats the clue!! To get everyone working together! My kids will tell you I am the worst when it comes to taking the time to stop and work with them on their chore......but OMG it really does help!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer<br/>\nand supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be<br/>\nmade known to God.&quot;    Philippians 4.6<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email alerts & NEW webcam video instant messaging with Yahoo!
