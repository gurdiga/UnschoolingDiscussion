It&#39;s just that dh has his reservations, as do I<br/>\n,<br/>\n&gt;  about sending our kids into the world knowing nothing but the PBS sched.<br/>\n&gt;  O.K. Perhaps I&#39;m overreacting here, but I still have my concerns. Any<br/>\nadvice<br/>\n&gt;  would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;  Amy &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s funny -- PBS schedule.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, what I did (so take it for what it&#39;s worth!) as a sanity check at<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; beginning of hsing was to go to the state&#39;s standards.  They are online<br/>\nhere<br/>\n&gt; in Florida.  Look under the Dept. of Ed listings.   These are a<br/>\nline-by-line<br/>\n&gt; explanation of what the schools are supposed to be teaching the kids in<br/>\neach<br/>\n&gt; grade.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I found these to be reassuring that, even tho we have tended more and more<br/>\n&gt; toward relaxed hsing and unschooling, we are still hitting all the bases.<br/>\n&gt; The standards were not at all stringent in my estimation -- more of a<br/>\n&gt; minimum.  But they were a sanity check for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And there is a series out called What your X Grader Should Know.  Some<br/>\npeople<br/>\n&gt; say they have been very happy using this as a guide.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think you can use all of these tools, and more, and still happily hs,<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; or without a formal curriculum or part of one.  But I think it takes time<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; figure out what is best for you and yours.  And then that changes at just<br/>\n&gt; about the time you get it all figured out!  :):)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good luck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nance<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; PERFORM CPR ON YOUR APR!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
