I really have to bite my lip sometimes.  But you <br/>\nknow, at this point in time, at age 7, they are quite polite about 50% <br/>\nof the time and I&#39;m very happy with that.  They&#39;re still so little and <br/>\nthey forget sometimes.  I notice it  gets better all the time as they <br/>\nget older, so I know we&#39;re moving in the right direction in that <br/>\nregard..
