I have a question though.  If it is the norm to need a purpose to learn, then why do people go to museums or star gaze?  My dh and kids used to go to museums a lot and I could not understand what they could get out of it unless they were studying something that was there.  I would look at things and try to get the feeling I get when I have a purpose to learn it, but I couldn&#39;t.  Now that we have been unschooling for a few months, I am beginning to just look at things and be in awe of them or see the beauty in them.  Aren&#39;t these experiences learning experiences?  I hope they are because we have been doing a lot of this with our new microscope.  Maybe these things are not the things any one of us will look into in great depth and maybe that is what you are speaking of when you talk about purpose, more in-depth learning.  However, without this process of experiencing many things, how will we know what we really have a passion for?  <br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Leslie Moyer <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Monday, January 07, 2002 9:02 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Essence of learning<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n+ -----Original Message-----<br/>\n+ From: Pat Cald...

Some may or probably will disagree with me here but in my <br/>\nmind child centered learning may not always foster the love of <br/>\nlearning which is truly my goal.  Agree or Disagree?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree and I disagree.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are kids out there who need extra help along those lines.  They <br/>\nare IMHO by far not the norm.  But there are enough of them that no <br/>\nforum (including this one) should act like they don&#39;t exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the vast majority of kids, being left to their own interests is <br/>\nfine.  They will learn what they need, when they need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few cases where because of underlying problems a child <br/>\ndoes not thrive if left to figure things out on his own.  In those <br/>\ncases, I believe it is the responsibility of the parent to step in.  <br/>\nThe big trick is knowing if what you think is a problem child reallly <br/>\nis.  If you think your child has problems that you need to deal with, <br/>\nstep back and take a long hard look and make absolutely certain that <br/>\nthe problem is with the child and not with your preconceived notions <br/>\nof what &quot;normal&quot; is supposed to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way to tell the difference is this:  Is your child happy most of <br/>\nthe time?  Then don&#39;t worry much.  But if your child is unhappy and <br/>\nfrustrated most of the time, maybe (MAYBE) you need to do something.  <br/>\nBUT - - and this is very important - - if you are comin gout of more <br/>\nthan one year of ps, give the child a LOT of time (at least a full <br/>\nyear) to unlearn the bad stuff from school before making the decision <br/>\nto step in.  I waited 2 1/2 years with Wyndham, just watching him and <br/>\ntrying to let him be himself by giving him the tools and materials he <br/>\nwanted to fool around with.  It was becoming more and more clear in <br/>\nthat time that he did NEED our help with many things.  His happiness <br/>\nwas declining the whole time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the flipside of that coin is that my girls have had even longer <br/>\nto deschool - this is our 7th year - and until this year I was <br/>\nwaiting for signs in them one way or the other.  They were always <br/>\nlearning just enough to keep me from believing they needed help, even <br/>\nwhen dh and grandma were naysaying.  I see things in them this year <br/>\nthat just took time to develope.  And I know that had I tried with <br/>\nthem what works with Wyndham it would have been a disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hardest part about this is knowing the difference.  If I had not <br/>\nbeen through this both ways, I would probably be in the let them ALL <br/>\nunschool - it works for everyone camp.  As it is, I have strong <br/>\nbeliefs that unschooling is very good and is the best for the <br/>\nmajority but that there is no reason to expect it to be the perfect <br/>\nthing for EVERY child.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBridget</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84135975,"authorName":"Pat Cald...","from":"&quot;Pat Cald...&quot; &lt;homeschoolmd@...&gt;","profile":"homeschoolmd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Essence of learning","postDate":"1010282692","msgId":30746,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNTkwMWMxOTY1NiQ4N2U4ODE0MCQwMjAxYThjMEBkZXNrdG9wPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDIwMTA1MTk0My5nMDVKaGlKbTAwODA5N0BueWNzbXRwMW91dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4gPDAwYTUwMWMxOTYzMyRiNTkzMWJhMCQwMjAxYThjMEBkZXNrdG9wPiA8MDk5NDU1NjQ2MDEwNjEyRkU1QG1haWw1LnRyaWFkLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":30745,"nextInTopic":30750,"prevInTime":30745,"nextInTime":30747,"topicId":30733,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Sarah, Thanks for the encouraging words.

There is nothing<br/>\nwrong with sharing your interests with your children.  I think the key here<br/>\nwould be &quot;what would you do if they were *not* interested in what you saw<br/>\nunder the microscope?&quot;  If that&#39;s fine with you, then it&#39;s still<br/>\nchild-centered.  If it&#39;s not OK with you and you make them stick with it for<br/>\na certain amount of time or until some goal is met, then it would not be<br/>\nchild centered.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that is at least some factor in there is that a parent<br/>\nprobably &quot;should&quot; (for lack of a better phrase that comes to mind!) *enjoy*<br/>\nwhatever it is they&#39;re sharing.  Kids can see right through you and if<br/>\nyou&#39;re just staging a &quot;learning moment&quot; for *their* benefit then they won&#39;t<br/>\nbe fooled.  It depends a bit on what their experiences with learning were<br/>\nbefore this.  (I.e. were they &quot;made&quot; to study certain things or not?)  But<br/>\nby the same token, the above statement still applies....as long as it&#39;s OK<br/>\nwith you that they&#39;re NOT interested, then feel free to show them the world.<br/>\nIn fact, at least in the beginning stages of unschooling, it&#39;s probably an<br/>\nimportant factor in them being able to discover their joys and passions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when children have a trust that no one is going to &quot;make&quot; them learn<br/>\nsomething, then they will very likely be interested in a great deal of what<br/>\nyou are interested in.  Or at the very least will be willing to give it a<br/>\ntry.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that what you were wondering?<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie Moyer</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":89240901,"authorName":"Groundhoggirl","from":"Groundhoggirl &lt;groundhoggirl@...&gt;","profile":"groundhoggirl2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Essence of learning","postDate":"1010258845","msgId":30738,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMTA1MTkyNC5nMDVKTzR2ajAyMjk0NUBzbTEwLnRleGFzLnJyLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwN2YwMWMxOTYxYiQzNjU5NzQwMCQwMjAxYThjMEBkZXNrdG9wPg=="},"prevInTopic":30736,"nextInTopic":30739,"prevInTime":30737,"nextInTime":30739,"topicId":30733,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

When I say foster the love of learning, I do not mean force my ideas on what the love of learning should look like. My role as facilitator would be to just say hey does anyone want to ..... go to a museum, take a walk and observe birds, look at the stars, see what I see under the microscope, make some bread etc.  They will develop passions and interests which may be completely unrelated to anything I&#39;ve exposed them to but, the point is, I hope they will enjoy the process.  Does anyone have any thoughts on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30795,"nextTopicId":30820}}
