I was totally fed up as well. And like you, a working mother.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing that the two of you will go through is breaking all the schooling habits - it was easier for my son than it has been for me!  I think they say that it takes at least a month for every year your child has spent in school to get over it.  Sure, there may be a long time that he sits in front of a TV seemingly not doing anything... various things like that.  But what I came to realize is that without the pressures of school, my son slowly grew back his fascination with everything.  He didn&#39;t have to squeeze his TV time in around all the demands of school - so, if he was interested in something, he could take the time to really explore it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have moments of panic, thinking that I&#39;m ruining his life... yes, he&#39;s there alone all day long while I work.  But we talk to each other at least a dozen times a day.  I really enjoy the calls that start &quot;Mom!  guess what I just heard???&quot; and I get a lecture on weather patterns... or game design... or... or... <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd our evenings and weekends are a blast!  No having to stop to do homework... long discussions about whatever interests either of us... doing research together on the net... creating something... being free to explore who we are and what we want to grow to be!<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy - it&#39;s never too late...<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\n<br/>\nLari<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:GothicLoungeLizard@...\">GothicLoungeLizard@...</a><br/>\nSent: Mar 12, 2004 7:20 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] (unknown)<br/>\n<br/>\nHello everyone.

Those parents who care enough <br/>\nabout their children&#39;s education to dedicate otherwise &quot;spare&quot; time to <br/>\naccompany their children on a homeschooling adventure should be lauded.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarilyn also seems to place more value on rocket scientists than she does on <br/>\neducators.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not want my son or daughters to grow up to be homeschooling parents.  <br/>\nNor do I want them to be rocket scientists.  I want them to learn to love <br/>\nlearning, to grow into themselves, to examine their lives, to question <br/>\neverything, to make their own ways, to be self-confident and self-reliant, <br/>\nand to call me at least once a week (smile).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf my son wants to be a doctor, or if my daughter wants to be a writer, then <br/>\nI will support them in that endeavour.  If they have children and are <br/>\nconcerned about the state of public (or private) (or standard) education at <br/>\nthat time, and they choose to teach their children at home, then I will be <br/>\nexcited for my grandchildren, that they will embark on the education of a <br/>\nlifetime and will learn for learning&#39;s sake.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarilyn is wrong to assume that homeschoolers are not valuable to society, or <br/>\nthat homeschooling breeds only homeschoolers.  She is right to say, however, <br/>\nthat homeschooling is not necessarily a good idea for society at large.  No <br/>\nmatter how much we homeschoolers enjoy the journey, it is time-intensive and, <br/>\nat times, exhausting.  Not every parent is eager to assist, coach, watch, or <br/>\ntake pleasure in the independent education of a child.  Society is fortunate, <br/>\nhowever, that some parents are eager to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I think that Marilyn is right, but for the wrong reasons.

Going <br/>\n  &gt;through too much physical turmoil to get embroiled on the stuff on the list <br/>\n  &gt;too. But Helen&#39;s message struck me. I didn&#39;t appreciate her method but I <br/>\n  &gt;understood her madness.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;The plain fact is that we seem to have cycles on this list. The good, the <br/>\n  &gt;bad and oh yes, the ugly.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;We have moments when we shine. When we all come together to help one <br/>\n  &gt;another question and answer our collective approaches to schooling, <br/>\n  &gt;unschooling and parenting in general. These are the moments when we -each <br/>\n  &gt;of us- contribute just a little something, a little bit of our own flavor <br/>\n  &gt;and when taken in create a masterpiece.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Then we have moments when we get a little thoughtless or insensitive. <br/>\n  &gt;Perhaps too sensitive is what I should say. Moments when for just a New <br/>\n  &gt;York minute we let the bad in and become JUDGEMENTAL.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;That&#39;s okay. This list is full of moms, dads, teachers, leaders and since <br/>\n  &gt;we&#39;re all human on this list, the occasional screw-ups. But we acknowledge, <br/>\n  &gt;apologize and move on. And thank goodness for the occasional screw up. They <br/>\n  &gt;remind us to think before we speak, to consider and reconsider the way we <br/>\n  &gt;treat or mistreat others, such consideration is probably a big asset for a <br/>\n  &gt;group of folks attempting to guide their young-ins and deschool themselves <br/>\n  &gt;at the same time.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;The problem is when the Ugly sneaks it&#39;s ugly face in. Ahh, the moments <br/>\n  &gt;when we tear down instead of buildup. Then we go back in and do it again. <br/>\n  &gt;The long, long debates on whether so and so said what they said they said <br/>\n  &gt;and so forth. Usually followed by people upset about all the people saying <br/>\n  &gt;what was or was not said and then the comments about how people should go <br/>\n  &gt;and say things somewhere else.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;This is not new for us. But it is shameful. Because when we are good, we <br/>\n  &gt;are AWESOME! When we shine it is because, as a group we encourage, support <br/>\n  &gt;and unite.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;I do not care for the way Helen responded to the UGLY. But I do think it <br/>\n  &gt;came from an emotional place of frustration and disappointment that it had <br/>\n  &gt;come back again. And let&#39;s face it, when folks start telling other folks to <br/>\n  &gt;get on other lists, UGLY has come back in a big way.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Shame on us. Do you know what I do when the ugly comes? When the first <br/>\n  &gt;whiff of ugly has come I try to ignore it by becoming real friendly with my <br/>\n  &gt;delete button. But at times like this, times when UGLY has come back all <br/>\n  &gt;the way and brought friends, I leave. That&#39;s right. I&#39;ve been off this list <br/>\n  &gt;several times and I&#39;m about to do it again. And that&#39;s okay too. Because <br/>\n  &gt;the true feeling of this list is strong enough to survive even the ugly and <br/>\n  &gt;the disappearance of one or two faces. Ugly is like a fire and if we all <br/>\n  &gt;just stop feeding the flames IT WILL GO AWAY.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Sooner or later The Good will come back and when it does I and the others <br/>\n  &gt;who have already quietly slipped away for a bit will come back. I just hope <br/>\n  &gt;in the meantime that we haven&#39;t already permanently alienated some of the <br/>\n  &gt;wonderful people on this list who maybe don&#39;t understand our ups and downs. <br/>\n  &gt;The list will survive, but it could come back and bloom and thrive if only <br/>\n  &gt;we would all work just a little harder to stop feeding the ugly and start <br/>\n  &gt;working The Good.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Well, just my two cents, bye all, Jacli :)<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;Message: 1 &gt; Date: Sat, 23 Mar 2002 11:58:57 -0800 &gt; From: Helen Hegener <br/>\n  &gt; &gt;Subject: Checking in/checking out &gt; &gt;Dear friends and listmembers, &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &gt;It&#39;s a major disappointment to see this list fall back into the same <br/>\n  &gt; &gt;kind of downward spiral we experienced a few weeks (or was it &gt;months?) <br/>\n  &gt;ago. &gt;...

She dug her <br/>\nheels in for  a few days and we had some battles but they were battles we <br/>\nneeded. Sometimes it takes a mother to remove herself from a situation to <br/>\ngain some control. My daughter was of the mindset  that since she didnt have <br/>\nto go to school then she didnt have anybody to listen to. I went along with <br/>\nthat for a while , but a person can only take so much of back talk and what <br/>\nshall I call it? ummm..........very subtle noncompliance. I really dont mean <br/>\nthat she should bow to my every whim but I do expect  S.O.M.E. respect. I <br/>\nreally am an easy going person and dont expect a whole lot. <br/>\nI do have to admit to looking in to some online curriculums like Conlara and <br/>\nLaurel Springs. Im just so confused right now. I think. I keep going back and <br/>\nforth with it. I have forced days out of the house for Riding Lessons that <br/>\nshe does enjoy and errands and stuff.I find trying to keep her busy has made <br/>\nher cut down on her eating out of being bored.  Her attitude has definately <br/>\nshown a turn around on the days we just spend out of the house together. <br/>\nOn a better note , the family has faded off into the distance for now.

Then I told <br/>\nthe boys &quot;If you ever think what&#39;s going on here isn&#39;t right and you&#39;re <br/>\nafraid to talk to me or dad, go to Paul or Jeff and they will help you.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul&#39;s moved out of state.

You can guess the reaction by all to that!!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We ran into that a lot.  In order to correct the &#39;problem&#39;, I started making <br/>\na point of telling DS a subject we covered when he&#39;d ask a question/find an <br/>\nanswer.  We&#39;d explore something, go for a walk, make cookies, whatever and <br/>\nI&#39;d say, gee, we can count that as our PE/math/science/language arts/ what <br/>\never for today.  He&#39;d stop and smile and acknowledge the coolness of the <br/>\nwhole process and go about his business.  Now DS, age 12, can rattle off the <br/>\n&#39;subjects&#39; we&#39;ve been pursuing with the best of them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t do this constantly, just often enough to start bringing it to his <br/>\nawareness.  Now, we&#39;ll talk about or explore something and he&#39;ll say, &#39;Gee, I <br/>\nguess we just did (fill in the blank), huh mom?&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen others ask him what he&#39;s learning they usually aren&#39;t interested enough <br/>\nto find out HOW he&#39;s learning it.  In fact, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever had <br/>\nanyone spend enough time and attention to his answer to have him explain what <br/>\nsorts of things we are doing.  Some of them get to hear the beginnings of an <br/>\nexplanation, but then they are ready to be off on different topics because <br/>\nthey were only being polite to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there.  It&#39;s okay to feel like you aren&#39;t accomplishing anything <br/>\nsometimes.  Looking back, it seems to me that the first through third grade <br/>\nage was the hardest to resist the need to school at home.  That&#39;s when all <br/>\nthe other kids are starting school and learning to read and all.  That&#39;s when <br/>\nI still had a sense of &#39;you know, it&#39;s not too late, you could change your <br/>\nmind and enroll him in PS and he&#39;d be able to catch up&#39;.  Ugh!  After you are <br/>\npast age 8 or 9 and see that kidlets really are learning something from their <br/>\ndaily activities, it gets a lot easier.  I felt much easier when my youngster <br/>\nstarted reading his older brother&#39;s books.  There is 10 yrs between the two <br/>\nof them and younger DS wasn&#39;t at all afraid to read older DS&#39;s books from <br/>\nabout age 7 or 8.  He didn&#39;t understand all of the material, but he was up to <br/>\nthe challenge of trying.  He read rather major novels from start to finish.  <br/>\nHe understood the words, just missed many of the implications.  Now as he <br/>\nre-reads those same books, he tells me all about the things he didn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand then that he understands now.  It&#39;s a great experience for him to <br/>\nrealize that review never hurt anyone and that we sometimes understand things <br/>\nmuch better with more experience.  (Doesn&#39;t hurt mom&#39;s credibility, either, <br/>\nfor him to realize that life experience often brings greater understanding.  <br/>\nheheheh)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that was a turning point for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut of self defense, DS has learned to tell people that everyone learns at a <br/>\ndifferent pace.  He has a cousin that loved to tell him how stupid DS was <br/>\nbecause he didn&#39;t go to school.  (We heard a lot of other PS propaganda from <br/>\nthat kid, too.  I was amazed to hear the exact same words coming out of his <br/>\nmouth as the phrases spouted by NEA.  I don&#39;t know whether it was his father <br/>\nexplaining why the cousins couldn&#39;t homeschool or the PS teacher defending <br/>\nher job.  But that&#39;s sort of a different issue.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe waited and watched.  Pretty soon it became obvious that there were topics <br/>\nDS was covering which his cousin had no clue about.  When cousin realized DS <br/>\nknew more about different things, DS simply pointed out to him that everyone <br/>\nlearns things at a different pace.  Just because we have not formally covered <br/>\na topic before the cousins, does not mean we&#39;ll never learn it and ps cousins <br/>\naren&#39;t required to keep pace with DS, either.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(I over heard the conversation that day and was bursting with pride at the <br/>\nway DS handled his over bearing and bossy cousin.  I&#39;ll probably burn in hell <br/>\nfor that one, but it was worth it!  &lt;eg&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy your kids.  If you need more structure to your schedule, do what you <br/>\nneed to for your family, setting bed times or nap times or story times and <br/>\ndinner times, etc.  But, don&#39;t feel you need to follow the ps schedule or <br/>\nanyone else&#39;s, for that matter!<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"stormy1986@webtv.net","from":"stormy1986@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"AgArljARFVkfdSIPxmW-Qf8-up-AX8z7Hxe5mwMgWDDs5qU3igrdqTTOuqSJVlnlkn2tQHkjXMbQZ98","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"(unknown)","postDate":"951968418","msgId":6874,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MzguNjg3NC45NTkyNjk3NDdAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6548,"nextInTopic":13464,"prevInTime":6873,"nextInTime":6875,"topicId":6454,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When they find our we are in a minority religious group and homeschool as well....you can just see fringe lunatic in their eyes as they size me up and shake","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1345498980\">When they find our we are in a minority religious group and homeschool<br/>\nas well....you can just see &quot;fringe lunatic&quot; in their eyes as they size<br/>\nme up and shake their heads at the fate of my poor children.

My husband shares the learning disability of the boys and<br/>\nhe is a field mechanic and machinist so I am very aware that they can<br/>\nsucceed if they are given a good chance, he travels alot with his job and<br/>\nnow the kids and I go visit where he is working, the learning<br/>\nopportunities are limitless and we learn together about the places we are<br/>\ngoing to visit or want to visit. We play a game we call fantasy vacation,<br/>\nwe pick a place we want to go, learn as much as we can about it and plan<br/>\na vacation, we decide where we would stay, eat, go visit, what the<br/>\nweather would be like, it is fun and I am learning as much as they do. I<br/>\nam so sorry I did not have the courage to do this for my other kids, they<br/>\nmissed so much and so did I by trusting that the school knew best.
