She went with us loaded down with her academic books from a <br/>\nhomeschooling co-op which included<br/>\nAnatomy and Phisiology, Geometry, and World History.  She truly came home a <br/>\nchanged child.  She quit the co-op and those textbooks are gathering dust . <br/>\nShe <br/>\nread Grace Llewlyns &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;,  made a quilt with <br/>\nquilting pieces from the conference raffle, started sculpting,  became very <br/>\ninvolved <br/>\nin photography, planted strawberry corn, which is in pots all over our house, <br/>\nin preparation for a small green house she is designing,  went back to <br/>\nwriting <br/>\npoetry(which is all over her bedroom floor), decided to direct a play this <br/>\nspring and has found the play and a facility as well as a group of <br/>\nhomeschoolers <br/>\nto act in it, became interested in vegetarian cooking and made a wonderful <br/>\ndinner for us all last night.  She and I took a wheel building class and <br/>\nlearned <br/>\nto throw pots that we gave friends and family for Christmas gifts.  I <br/>\ncontinue to just be in awe of her enthusiasm, energy and the joy she brings <br/>\nto her <br/>\ndays.  She has always been very self-directed and has homeschooled since she <br/>\nwas <br/>\n8 but her energies went into &quot;school-like&quot; pursuits.  There was very little <br/>\nof the joyfulness evident that I now see in her every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning , she has discovered boxes of pictures that I never got into <br/>\nalbums and is working on a scrapbook  of her life so far.  She is also <br/>\ninvolved <br/>\nin community theatre and enjoys public speaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenna asked if you could e-mail her as she would love to be involved in any <br/>\nway at the Live and Learn Conference this year.  We will definitely be there. <br/>\n <br/>\nAfter the changes in our lives from last year, I wouldn&#39;t miss it for <br/>\nanything.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer e-mail is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brennadee@...\">brennadee@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGail<br/>\n(who now even drives around with unschooling bumper stickers in our extremely <br/>\nconservative and religious homeschool community)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88052,"nextTopicId":88134}}
