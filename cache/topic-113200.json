Children are happily welcomed, so bring the whole family- there&#39;s something for everyone!  Come ask questions, offer your sage advice, relax, renew and recharge with unschoolers from all over.  Leave invigorated and whole and maybe a little sandy!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur base camp for Good Vibrations is the Doubletree Hotel San Diego/Del Mar, a beautiful and conveniently located hotel less than two miles from the world-renowned Torrey Pines State Reserve and Beach.
