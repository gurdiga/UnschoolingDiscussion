My 13 yr. old really wants to go to 8th grade<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; this fall (has friends from her softball team that go there).  She&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; never been to school before in her entire life (unschooled, to<br/>\n&gt; boot).  She reads and writes and spells great, knows a little bit of<br/>\n&gt; history and science, too, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I thought I better come out of lurkdom to give my $.02 on this one.<br/>\nAs a brief intro - my name is Diane and I live in Kansas.  I&#39;ve been <br/>\nmarried to Jeff for almost 21 years.  We have two children - a 19 <br/>\nyear old daughter - homeschooled since 15, but not unschooled at <br/>\nfirst - now a part time college student and full time employee, <br/>\nmoving into her own apartment Thursday , AND a 13 year old son - <br/>\nunschooled since he was 10.  He&#39;s the reason I write.  He wanted to <br/>\nreturn to school last fall (7th grade) to see what middle school was <br/>\nlike.  He was concerned about his math skills because we hadn&#39;t <br/>\nworked traditionally on math.  We began to work away, at his <br/>\nsuggestion, and yet it was less than thrilling for both of us.  To <br/>\nmake a long story short,  he returned for the first quarter - <br/>\nreassured himself that he wasn&#39;t missing anything and  remembered how <br/>\nboring and tedious the work was,  and how silly the rules.  They <br/>\nplaced him in a gifted math class and still spent over 2 weeks <br/>\nexplaining prime numbers.  I think that&#39;s when he gave up. He did <br/>\nenjoy an Explorations in Technology class, but that was it.  He came <br/>\nback home at Thanksgiving.  Our agreement was that he could come back <br/>\nhome whenever he wanted,  but he couldn&#39;t return to ps until the next year.<br/>\nAt this point he has no plans of ever returning.  He&#39;s a committed <br/>\nunschooler - more so now because he came to this on his own.  I had <br/>\nheard others say the same thing whose children returned to school briefly at <br/>\nthis age and it&#39;s really true.   We even consider his return part of <br/>\nhis unschooling adventure.  There was no discussion about wanting to <br/>\ngo/not go on a particular day because he always knew it was up to <br/>\nhim.  Homework - up to him.  We had discussed the fact that if he was <br/>\nchoosing to go to school,  he needed to be prepared to play the game <br/>\nand jump through the hoops.  I never had to wake him up in the <br/>\nmorning, or remind him to finish work.  It was his choice/his <br/>\nresponsibility - so different from our earlier experience.  When he <br/>\ncame back home,  I thought he&#39;d deschool for awhile,  but the return to <br/>\nhealthy unschooling was almost immediate.  If he chooses to return <br/>\nagain,  I think we&#39;ll approach it the same way and then hold our <br/>\nbreath.  Even in the short time he was back,  we saw negative <br/>\nattitude changes, so we were very relieved when he came back home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Listen, I&#39;m worried.

Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a positive note, I believe strongly that unschoolers will change the <br/>\npublic schools without even a glance back their direction.  There are things <br/>\nunschoolers believe that professional educators do not, like that kids can <br/>\nlearn to read on their own, and that if something is fascinating kids can&#39;t <br/>\nhelp but absorb it.  The open classroom didn&#39;t work because kids were forced <br/>\nto go.  Schoolhouse Rock worked, but it was so obviously separate and <br/>\n*educational* that kids were kind of ashamed if they enjoyed it.   Animaniacs <br/>\nand Histaria (sp?) are better at incorporating the educational stuff into the <br/>\nentertaining stuff.   I think after a few more years of people successfully <br/>\nunschooling, some researchers are going to pick up some data and anecdotal <br/>\nevidence (perhaps some homeschooled researchers who started off defending <br/>\nthemselves and found a thesis in the making) and some of that &quot;news&quot; is going <br/>\nto get back to educational theorists and philosophers who will get the public <br/>\nschools on some whole new kick that will look a lot like some unschooling <br/>\nwe&#39;re already seeing.
