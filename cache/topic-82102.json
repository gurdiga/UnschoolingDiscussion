He was tired so he hung out in his stroller while I was <br/>\ncruising through the sale racks.

I was so peeved at the moment.  <br/>\nI replied something about it being difficult for kids to wait around <br/>\nthat long.  I remember thinking that my kids often get crabby <br/>\nand &quot;misbehave&quot; when we are out and about and more often than not it <br/>\nis because they have had enough.  I am much more atune to that these <br/>\ndays although sometimes they have to put up with me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI felt insulted that she would even say that to me.  As if my <br/>\nchildren behaving for HER deserved some sort of praise.  I was <br/>\nalmost regretful that they had not been more there usual selves <br/>\nhiding in the racks!

I sometimes hallucinate clearly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I have spent 2 out of the last 3 weeks talking about art <br/>\nand the internet. We were first in Orono-Bar Harbor area in Maine, came <br/>\nback home to crank out some work and leave pronto for Easton, PA. Two <br/>\nof the &#39;georgeouest&#39; places I&#39;ve ever been two.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur kids not only came with us. They were with us during the talks and <br/>\neven participated. Up in Maine, they just did not want to miss anything <br/>\nand were happy to be with us and the computers in the classrooms. I <br/>\nguess it shows their unschooled because they actually found the whole <br/>\nidea of a graduate classroom entertaining. It doesn&#39;t hurt either that <br/>\nthese kids have been nursed while at the computer and have always seen <br/>\nus working. Mommy and Daddy&#39;s work is not a mystery to them. So in a <br/>\nway it was like any other day but with more people and at a different <br/>\nlocation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, they blew people away. &quot;How well behaved&quot;. &quot;You&#39;ve taught them so <br/>\nwell&quot;. &quot;They are so well trained&quot; (I swear a person said that as if <br/>\nthey were puppies). The thing is, I can&#39;t claim I had control of what <br/>\nwent on during those 10 days we were &quot;on the road&quot;. My kids get to <br/>\nchoose what they want to do. If we can&#39;t agree on it happening at the <br/>\ntime they want, we negotiate. Also, they are really neat people that I <br/>\nhave the honor to have given birth. I&#39;m not just saying it out of <br/>\nmotherly love. I really like them as people. They have interesting <br/>\npersonalities and, if there is one thing that I will take some credit <br/>\nfor is their sense of humor. Still, especially with the little one, <br/>\nthey have expressed their sense of humor from very early on and each <br/>\none of them shine for their brand of silliness. Evan is great with <br/>\nwords and dry wit. Aidan is a slut for slapstick and gross humor. And <br/>\nsomewhere we all seem to meet at the intersection of poopy jokes, <br/>\nBeatles references and Spongebob Squarepants.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point that I am trying to make here is that I feel that I am more <br/>\nkeeper of the flame than flame-maker. I feel that my kids have these <br/>\ninteresting lives that I have the honor to not just watch unfold but <br/>\nguide in any way they need. As I told a friend, I sometimes look at <br/>\nthem and feel like I have nothing to do with who they are. Not that I <br/>\nhave no influence, because I do, but that the whole idea of parenting <br/>\nas authorship of children, as if they where things to be molded and not <br/>\nhuman beings living life, has been blown away by my kids greatness. <br/>\nBeatlemania and all :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n/ l i z a, nyc<br/>\n============================<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://culturekitchen.com\">http://culturekitchen.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liza.typepad.com\">http://liza.typepad.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://typepadistas.com\">http://typepadistas.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":158112576,"authorName":"TeresaBnNC@aol.com","from":"TeresaBnNC@...","profile":"tbb1967","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] growing up responsible","postDate":"1065377952","msgId":82153,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5Yy4xYWQ1Y2U3YS4yY2IxYmFhMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":82148,"nextInTopic":82199,"prevInTime":82152,"nextInTime":82154,"topicId":82102,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/5/03 2:07:57 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

We can&#39;t<br/>\ncontrol our kids but we can control their environment so it gives them what<br/>\nthey need. And if you read here or on the Unschooling.com message boards,<br/>\nthere&#39;s loads information.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling comes naturally to some people but I don&#39;t think anyone should<br/>\nexpect to dump a lifetime&#39;s worth of indoctrination into schoolish thought<br/>\nquickly. Life in a schoolish society fills us full of unexamined thoughts.<br/>\nIt takes time to find them and examine them and to figure out how to detach<br/>\nthem from controling our emotions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish understanding and trusting unschooling were as easy as unschooling<br/>\nis! There isn&#39;t much simpler than letting kids learn :-) But if someone<br/>\nlacks curiosity about life or is filtering their vision through schoolish<br/>\nlenses they can think they get it but don&#39;t really.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] growing up responsible","postDate":"1065333916","msgId":82110,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMyLjNlYzQ4OTdkLjJjYjEwZTljQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":82109,"nextInTopic":82121,"prevInTime":82109,"nextInTime":82111,"topicId":82102,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/4/03 10:47:06 PM, listdiva@culturekitchen.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-885056184\">In a message dated 10/4/03 10:47:06 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:listdiva@...\">listdiva@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; In our society we tell kids that they are not whole yet.

He bragged Marty up big, just <br/>\nGUSHING, and then he said something like &quot;You can always tell when a child is <br/>\nfrom a house with a lot of discipline and rules.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI smiled and tried to say politely that we didn&#39;t really have many rules at <br/>\nall, but it wasn&#39;t the time or place to explain it all.  So I didn&#39;t agree <br/>\n(&quot;Yes you can!&quot;) because he was QUITE wrong, you can&#39;t.  And HE had totally <br/>\nmis-imagined the reasons for Marty&#39;s enthusiasm and cooperation.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople look at a result and they say (sometimes internally and sometimes out <br/>\nthere with words) &quot;Obviously your parents didn&#39;t discipline you&quot; but in my <br/>\nexperience (long and nosy experience) discipline screws up way more people than <br/>\nit helps.

Kirby was <br/>\n&quot;on&quot;--responsible, organized, funny--and they got to see him get a tournament going with 39 <br/>\nparticipants.  It was a Magic: The Gathering draft tournament (that will mean <br/>\nsomething to some of the people here, but not all).  The 39 entrants ranged in <br/>\nage from 11 to their 40s, but everyone was fully attentive to Kirby&#39;s <br/>\ndirections (he&#39;s 17, but getting to that age where you can&#39;t really tell, kinda <br/>\n16-to-20&#39;s looking).   <br/>\n<br/>\nI called him at 11:30 to ask him to be extra quiet when he comes home.  He <br/>\nusually gets off at 1:00 a.m. and then cleans for 20 minutes or so.  He said he <br/>\nwill be really late, because they&#39;re two nearly hour-long rounds from the end, <br/>\nand it could be as late as 3:00 or 4:00 before they clean up after all that.  <br/>\nBut he&#39;ll definitely not wake his grandpa up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe became responsible without growing up with a lot of discipline and rules.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":147376218,"authorName":"liza sabater","from":"liza sabater &lt;listdiva@...&gt;","profile":"lm_sabater","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] growing up responsible","postDate":"1065328703","msgId":82104,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMwQkY0RTgyLUY2RUQtMTFENy1BMjRDLTAwMDM5M0I4NEZCNkBjdWx0dXJla2l0Y2hlbi5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDMxMDA0LjIxMTgyMy4tNzI4MjkzLjExLnNpeHJlZGhlYWRzQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":82102,"nextInTopic":82109,"prevInTime":82103,"nextInTime":82105,"topicId":82102,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
