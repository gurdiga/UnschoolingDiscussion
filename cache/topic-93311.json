The rest of the new film makers are <br/>\nall in their 20&#39;s & 30&#39;s. At 16, Cam is certainly the baby. But they treat him <br/>\nas any other---and are in awe of the freshness he brings.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe filmed two scenes of his first fivr minute film today. It&#39;s about..... ta <br/>\nDAH! .... Unschooling! &lt;G&gt; We borrowed a classroom from his (and my) old <br/>\nprivate school. We got a bunch of his buds from a local public school&#39;s drama <br/>\ndepartment. Catering by Mom. It went very well. Cameron was calm and in charge, but <br/>\nnot bossy or too demanding. He got a lot from his actors.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;ll be shown June 4 & 5 at Spoleto in Charleston (that&#39;s a pretty big deal <br/>\nfor those of you not familiar with Spoleto). It&#39;s been a great experience so <br/>\nfar; his classmates are so supportive----and one is even thinking of using him <br/>\nas her camera man for a film later this summer!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck to Lexie! That&#39;s exciting!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93249,"nextTopicId":93111}}
