His family had lived next door to my best friend, whom we lived <br/>\nwith for 6 months while waiting for our home to be finished being built. The <br/>\nfirst time we met was when he got out of his parents van in a surong (sp?) and <br/>\nslide pumps. He gave me a smile and now admits that he automatically assumed <br/>\nI would either turn away or look disgusted or some such action he obviously <br/>\nreceives regularly. I smiled back and said &quot;Hello&quot;. He looked suprised and said, <br/>\n&quot;Heeeeeyyyy&quot;. As I began to pull groceries out of the car, I turned to him <br/>\nand said, &quot;Where&#39;d you get those shoes? They are just too cute.&quot; He said, <br/>\n&quot;Fredricks of Hollywood, honey and I got &#39;em on sale too girl!!!&quot; My hubby came out <br/>\nto help unload and J looked like he expected disdain from Phil. Again to his <br/>\nsurprise, my hubby said,&quot;Hey! How are you?&quot; When he noticed J&#39;s shoes he said, <br/>\n&quot;Nice shoes, my wife would like those. Hey Rhonda did you see those shoes?&quot; <br/>\nJay is about 6&#39; 2, 250 lbs of solid Somoain. He put his hand on his hip and <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Why are you being nice?&quot; Phil and I looked at each other and back at J and <br/>\nin unison said, &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t we?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThat was it, the bond had begun. So when I invited him to the girls party <br/>\nalong with his 3 younger siblings, I never gave it a second thought. I have quite <br/>\nan array of friends, right winged,  left winged, Christians,  Pagans, and a <br/>\nslew of political affiliations, homeschoolers, unschoolers, go to schoolers. <br/>\nAll shapes and sizes. When J walked into my house it got incredibly quiet. <br/>\nDouble takes and dropped jaws. Kass and Kree ran in from the pool screaming &quot;J&#39;s <br/>\nhere!!!!&quot; With his ever so popular hand on hip and better makeup than I have <br/>\never applied in this lifetime, he squilled, &quot;It&#39;s time to get this party <br/>\nstarted!!!&quot; Even the most uncomfortable guests had to laugh. He took over in the <br/>\nkitchen (he can cook his a$$ off) and started talking to everyone in ear <br/>\nshot....&quot;Hi I&#39;m J, who are you?&quot; Hi I&#39;m J, who are you?&quot; Hi I&#39;m J, who are you?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe party was a great success and everyone was polite and kind reagrdless of <br/>\ntheir understanding of &quot;what&quot; J was. Only one person questioned why I allowed <br/>\nsuch a person to know my children and be so close with our family. I was at a <br/>\nloss for words. &quot;Huh?&quot; was all that came out of my mouth. Finally after <br/>\ngaining my composure back I said, &quot;For the same reasons you are my friend. He&#39;s <br/>\nkind, he&#39;s funny, he&#39;s caring, he&#39;s smart, he loves us.&quot; I wasn&#39;t angry at having <br/>\nto explain it, I was just caught off guard. Perhaps I shouldn&#39;t have been. I&#39;m <br/>\nnot sure. The explaination I got was something about hate the sin, love the <br/>\nsinner....OK whatever, NOT how we see it, but if that makes them feel better, I <br/>\nguess it&#39;s better than cruelty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I&#39;m babbling again, but I it made me think about how little this <br/>\nculture has changed when it comes to orientations. My kids know we aren&#39;t gonna <br/>\ncare one hoot, who they love as long as they give love and receive love. We had a <br/>\ndiscussion the other day that it&#39;s too bad that families still disintegrate <br/>\nover these issues. My girls watched an HBO movie with me not long ago called <br/>\n&quot;Normal&quot;. It&#39;s about a transgendered man, married for 25 years who finally comes <br/>\nout to his family. It was a beautiful movie and we all watched it as a <br/>\nfamily. We all cried at the parts where he was taunted, we all cried when he told <br/>\nhis children, we all cried when he got beat up for being who he was. It lead to <br/>\na wonderful family dialogue on tolerance. I have to say, I loved that my <br/>\nchildren didn&#39;t understand why there is even a need for such a discussion. Sadly <br/>\nthey know now. When their schooled friends come over and call names such as <br/>\ngaylord, lezzy, or faggot, my kids are quick to repremand them.They ask if the <br/>\nkids know what they just said? They ask how many such persons the taunting kids <br/>\nknow who fit that discription? They ask what will those kids do if their <br/>\nbrothers or sisters end up being one of the desciptions? They always end with, &quot;What <br/>\nwould you do if your child was?&quot; And they wait for a real answer. <br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully your list will grow and people can learn more about whatever it is <br/>\nthey fear. <br/>\nThanx for creating it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Sharing Culture","postDate":"1056150323","msgId":75036,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4Zi4xYmYxMzdhYy4yYzI0ZWQzM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":75035,"nextInTopic":75061,"prevInTime":75035,"nextInTime":75037,"topicId":74973,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/20/03 5:00:52 PM, sheran@ptd.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1296779571\">In a message dated 6/20/03 5:00:52 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheran@...\">sheran@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Did you ever wonder why we even care if the government approves or <br/>\n<br/>\nrecognizes our marriages or not?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSocial security benefits.<br/>\nInheritance.<br/>\nFinancial and physical responsibility for children born within a marriage.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout a marriage there are no widows and widowers, and long LONG before our <br/>\ngovernment ever existed the concept of widows&#39; benefits existed in many other <br/>\ncultures.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Sharing Culture","postDate":"1056149933","msgId":75035,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJkMDNqZCtrbXF0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE4Yy4xYzI0Zjk5OC4yYzI0ZTg2ZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":75033,"nextInTopic":75036,"prevInTime":75034,"nextInTime":75036,"topicId":74973,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Did you ever wonder why we even care if the government approves or recognizes our marriages or not?

We live around Hutterites who dress and speak differently and whose culture is totally foreign to our own.  We walk up to them when Margaux has a question and introduce ourselves and ask if it is okay to ask them some questions.  Usually, they are very friendly and want to answer.  One time there was an African decent cashier at Wal Mart when Margaux was younger.  Margaux called him Jean Paul Jean Paul, from seeing an episode of Seinfeld dedicated to a runner from Trinidad & Tobago who was dark brown.  Was this prejudice?  No way!  I just told her that he was not Jean Paul.  She said, &quot;he has skin like Jean Paul.&quot;  I said, &quot;Yeah, he does have lovely brown skin, just like Jean Paul.&quot;  That was it, it was over.    Where am I going with this?  Ummmm.....
