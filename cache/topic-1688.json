My <br/>\nson Adam, now 13, had horrible mood swings, went through bouts with OCD and <br/>\ndepression.  At the age of 10 he was hospitalized for depression.  He <br/>\nexhibited suicidal ideation and he was also self-abusing by scratching his <br/>\nface when he got especially angry.   It was horrible, and we went through 5 <br/>\ndifferent medications.  The one that worked best for him was Desipramine.  <br/>\nBut that drug is not without risks and he needed cardiograms before he could <br/>\neven be put on it.  Now, though, he is off all medications and doing better <br/>\nbeing homeschooled than when he was in public school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I also suffer from depression, which is greatly helped by Zoloft.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis OCD and depression and moodswings seem to be strongest when he is <br/>\nstressed, so we try to limit his stressors once we&#39;ve identified them.  He is <br/>\nmuch better now, although he still has his moments.. they are definitely <br/>\nfewer and farther between.
