We<br/>\nhave embraced the unschooling approach in the past three years.  I have met<br/>\nsome of you and know others.  I am currently a full-time student at OU.  I<br/>\nhave a double major of Anthropology and Women&#39;s Studies.  This semester I am<br/>\ndoing an Honor&#39;s research project for my Anthropology research.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe research, in a nutshell, has to do with the way children learn.  It will<br/>\nbe a comparison between indigenous ways of learning and unschooling,<br/>\nbasically.  I would like to interview as many unschooling families as I can.<br/>\nI am going to send out surveys to those who are interested in participating.<br/>\nI would also like to observe several families firsthand.  If you are<br/>\ninterested in participating, please email me and ask any question you may<br/>\nhave.  If you would be willing to let me observe and are in the<br/>\nNorman-OKC-Edmond area let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis research is the beginning of my research as an anthropologist, and will<br/>\nbe invaluable to an understanding of our modern connections to indigenous<br/>\nknowledge and traditions.  Please consider being a part of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\nKimberly Cooke<br/>\n(405)737-5433<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Please put &quot;unschooling&quot; as the subject line in any responses</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17260,"nextTopicId":17258}}
