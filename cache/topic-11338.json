If you&#39;ve ever had raw cow&#39;s <br/>\nmilk, you know that the taste between that and the stuff you get at the store <br/>\nis pretty drastically different!  But, go to the cooking aisle at the grocery <br/>\nstore, canned milk section and you&#39;ll probably find a box or can of goat&#39;s <br/>\nmilk.  They may also have it fresh in the dairy section.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was raised on goat&#39;s milk.  From 6 yr&#39;s old, I helped with the care of the <br/>\ngoats.  By 10 they were my job entirely...including milking, veterinary care <br/>\nand birthing.  It is much easier to handle the care of a goat than a <br/>\ncow...especially if you want the whole family involved.  Also, goat&#39;s milk is <br/>\noften easier to digest than cow&#39;s.  If allergies are an issue in your family, <br/>\nyou may get ahead even more by avoiding allergens in the goats feed.  Be <br/>\ncareful what you feed the goat because the milk flavor changes (i.e. give it <br/>\nlots of peaches or peach peels and you&#39;ll get milk that tastes much different <br/>\nthan fed only on grain and hay!).  Believe almost all the stories you hear <br/>\nabout goats eating everything in sight.  Most of them are true, with the <br/>\nexception of small children and tin cans.  LOL  (they do like the glue on the <br/>\ncans and can be a friendly lot, which leads to &#39;nibbling&#39; on people.  I never <br/>\nreceived any more injury from a goat than getting my foot stepped on and <br/>\nbruised...once.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t bother keeping a billy goat on the same property with a nanny!  The <br/>\nbilly goat hormones/phermones will cause the milk to smell and taste <br/>\ndifferent...it can be quite nasty.  Besides you only need a billy around for <br/>\nbreeding...for that you can transport the nanny for a visit to a local <br/>\nbreeder or artificial inseminate.  Believe me, billy goats smell!  Nannies <br/>\nonly are not at all bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been out of town (and on no mail) for a few days...so if this little <br/>\nrant of mine has nothing at all to do with the current thread...my apologies! <br/>\n It&#39;ll either be the start of a new one or cheerfully (I hope!) ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11342,"nextTopicId":11371}}
