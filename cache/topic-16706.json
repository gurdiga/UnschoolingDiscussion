Dustin attended public <br/>\nschool for grades k-3 1/2.  We just helped him find something that motivated <br/>\nhim. <br/>\nFor him this was surfing, we went several days a week to the beach and later <br/>\nin the winter month it was snowboarding.  For my son he needs new <br/>\nexperiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo cure the at home boredom I brought him beside me in what I was doing to <br/>\nsee what interested him.  He became very interested in Ebay, half. Com and <br/>\nbegan to sell stuff he no longer wanted. He thought this was great as he <br/>\ncould watch the bids all week. He still does this now and lists his own items <br/>\nwith some HTML, I review it and he posts. Its great!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also said to him when he says he is bord &quot;well would you rather be <br/>\nbord a couple times a week or you can go back to school if that is what you <br/>\nwant&quot; &quot;Um, no that&#39;s ok Im not bord anymore.&quot; He says.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also notice when he does say this that it is because I haven&#39;t spent enough <br/>\ntime with him.  Usually all he wants is to just on the trampoline with me or <br/>\nplay xbox.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132800757,"authorName":"encadia@aol.com","from":"encadia@...","profile":"lasvegashillgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] bored","postDate":"1051116806","msgId":65628,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkNi44MDJmOGI0LjJiZDgxZjA2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":65602,"nextInTopic":65660,"prevInTime":65627,"nextInTime":65629,"topicId":16706,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"LOL !

My 14 dd has been relaxed-homeschooled for 4 years and unschooling starting this year. She has decided to go to high school next year. I am not thrilled but accept she wants to try it out. We live in an isolated area- friends for her are at least 20 min drive away and all in school. <br/>\nI have been trying many of the ideas here and feel like I&#39;m getting the hang of it, read Sandra&#39;s article about boredom, about school on your own terms, etc. Just telling you this because I want to continue to unschool her until she goes to HS, and if she decides to come back out after a while. <br/>\nBut I feel stuck. She is just so bored right now. I think she just wants a wider world but I don&#39;t seem to be able to help her make that work. She has interest in theater which we pursue and always have, but I guess that isn&#39;t enough right now. I try to strew more info about things that interest her but she just isn&#39;t interested in much of anything. <br/>\nWell, I feel like I&#39;m whining. I keep thinking there are lots of things she could be doing but her interest is not &#39;piqued&#39;. I kinda remember feeling restless too around that age. Has anyone else faced this?<br/>\nMary T. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Annette Naake","from":"&quot;Annette Naake&quot; &lt;naake1999@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"scXSprN5rwpi63pWrwl2QBKeHsysd6pkijrpeVNWoHTfzI-xx81qJWg8apu0OKLkKuIMHrOnJnENmevKBr7faWkjsaF0NxVgadN08Zm_","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"bored","postDate":"983070344","msgId":16706,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PExBVzItRjE1NGthcDdwOGJWUFowMDAwMzFjMkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":65602,"prevInTime":16705,"nextInTime":16707,"topicId":16706,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My oldest sometimes says he s bored.
