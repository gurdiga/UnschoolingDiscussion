Columbus sounds like homeschooling nirvana to me, compared to Akron (our former residence).  There are a few people on the UNO list who are relatively close to Wooster, but not here in town.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a curriculum fair/used book sale at a church here in town next weekend.  Part of me wants to go to see if I&#39;ll run into anyone unschoolish; part of me figures if I&#39;m going to find unschoolers that won&#39;t be the place!

There were several new to me people. I&#39;m in<br/>\nthe northend of Columbus. I&#39;ve been considering starting an unschoolers<br/>\ngroup but don&#39;t what to do it alone.

There are several open minded people<br/>\nthat attend that meeting. It&#39;s monday, June 2nd, at the Worthington Library<br/>\nat 7pm. It&#39;s inclusive not all unschoolers but the best, IMO, group around.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re close enough to Columbus try to get there. Ang comes in from<br/>\nPataskala when she can.
