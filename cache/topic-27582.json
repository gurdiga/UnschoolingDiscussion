Home is Where the School Is The article is online, at the website of the organization that puts out the magazine: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1101798522\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;From the newest issue of &quot;HR Magazine&quot; (Human Resources), an article called<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Home is Where the School Is&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article is online, at the website of the organization that puts out the<br/>\nmagazine:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shrm.org/hrmagazine/articles/1101/default.asp?page=1101grossman.asp\">http://www.shrm.org/hrmagazine/articles/1101/default.asp?page=1101grossman.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some quotes from the article:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The number of homschooled children has tripled over the past decade, leading<br/>\nto workplace changes as these children make their way into the workforce.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To find reliable employees, Chick-fil-A prefers to tap what it believes is a<br/>\nunique source of talent - high school- and college-age homeschoolers...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When it comes to homeschoolers, I&#39;ve only heard good things from our<br/>\nrestaurant operators who employ them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Homeschoolers are popping up everywhere, moving seamlessly into colege and<br/>\nthe workplace, thriving in internships and in entry-and professional-level<br/>\njobs.  They&#39;re also making a mark as entrepeneurs.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When Ray, who once taught science in the public school system, is asked to<br/>\ndescribe homeschooled students for prospective employers, he paints a picture<br/>\nthat&#39;s almost too good to be true: &#39;Self-starters, reliable and creative,<br/>\nintellectually perpared, better than average, read voraciously, watch TV<br/>\nless.&#39; &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;[Homeschoolers} are stable and mature, good team players and likely to stand<br/>\nup for what they think is right.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article had some quotes from critics of homeschoolers, and also explained<br/>\nwhat homeschooling is.  The definite message of the article was that<br/>\nhomeschoolers are desirable employees.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article ends with the following paragraph:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In the final analysis, if you&#39;re hiring, homeschoolers may be a good<br/>\ninvestment.  Cutting through the stereotypes, Lines, who has studied the<br/>\nmovement for many years, perhaps says it best.  &#39;If I didn&#39;t know anything<br/>\nabout someone other than their education background, I&#39;d rather hop into a<br/>\nfoxhole with a homeschool kid than one from public school. The homeschool kid<br/>\nwill be a little better educated and dependable.  It&#39;s just the law of<br/>\naverages.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(My husband, Larry, is also quoted in the article.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\n    Joanne<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------<br/>\nMembership on this list does not automatically confer membership in <br/>\nthe National Home Education Network.
