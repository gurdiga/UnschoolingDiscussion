I could have just said...actually, I did give it a bit of an <br/>\nattempt...&quot;I&#39;m simply not panicking about it. Katie knows her <br/>\nphonics, and can sound out her letters and writes (very) well...GOOD <br/>\nhandwriting...but she was a late speaker, so I&#39;m simply not going to <br/>\npanic about it, thanks anyway...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nbut I&#39;m a wimp. I put in a feeble attempt at pointing out some of <br/>\nthese things. In a world where HeidiC has the courage of her <br/>\nconvictions, I would have pointed out the research *I* have done on <br/>\nit, that tells me kids who read late are just as proficient readers <br/>\nin adulthood, as those who start early. I would have questioned the <br/>\nsystem that produces adult illiteracy (and gotten a lot of agreement <br/>\nfrom Phonics Lady, but hers was &quot;Because they don&#39;t use phonics in <br/>\nschool&quot;...never any question that making sure they are reading well <br/>\nby the end of third grade might be part of the problem...<br/>\n<br/>\nwell anyway. I figured that was the reason why there are some who <br/>\nmake it to adulthood unable to read: they&#39;re put into the box, and <br/>\nwhen they don&#39;t fit, they are made to feel inadequate, start <br/>\nstressing over it, setting themselves up for those defense mechanisms <br/>\nyou mention. I&#39;m so glad I&#39;ve protected Katie from so much of that, <br/>\nbut pretty frustrated at these well-meaning friends and relations who <br/>\nwant to put their panic on Katie...ticks me off, actually...<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for the input.

This <br/>\nwoman was hesitant to use labels...she wasn&#39;twilling to accept &quot;dyslexia&quot; as a <br/>\ncommon problem, believing that phonics instruction would eliminate 99% of <br/>\n&quot;dyslexia&quot; problems.**<br/>\n<br/>\n**It&#39;s because they&#39;re stuck in school!

The rest adopt a <br/>\nvariety of protective strategies - they learn to fake it, they learn to not let <br/>\npeople know they care, they learn to act as if reading and everything to do <br/>\nwith reading is stupid and not worth their time. But once identified as problem <br/>\nreaders, they rarely learn to read well.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who are supported and nurtured in a belief that reading will come in <br/>\nit&#39;s own good time don&#39;t have to fight against the fear and phobias induced by <br/>\nnot reading &quot;on time&quot; that schools supply so well to their students.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah finally read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone this week. She <br/>\nstarted it on Thursday last week, in our hotel room in Columbia, she finished it <br/>\nyesterday. She&#39;s started that book many times over the years, putting it down in <br/>\nfrustration each time. (They really are hard books for a not fluent reader, <br/>\nwho has to try to figure out for each unfamiliar word if they&#39;re not getting it <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s a made up word, or if it&#39;s a word they might know after all.) <br/>\nEach time I put it up on top of the shelf and reassured her that Harry would be <br/>\nthere when she was ready, no hurry. I&#39;ve written before of her struggles with <br/>\nreading, how much she wanted to read for so many years and how she was utterly <br/>\nunable to get past a very few very familiar words in spite of much effort. <br/>\nShe is now well and truly &quot;a reader&quot; - able to read everything she wants to <br/>\nread, in all situations. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is 11 1/2 years old. Were she in school she would be going into sixth <br/>\ngrade, and I am certain she would not be a reader. She is a very sensitive girl - <br/>\nthe school processes that would have attempted to help her with her problems <br/>\nhearing and separating sounds would have utterly convinced her she was stupid <br/>\nforevermore, and I would have been unable to do enough to undo that damage in <br/>\nher hours outside of school. She&#39;s a smart girl, though. She&#39;d have learned to <br/>\nfake it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLucky for her we were unschoolers before she was born.
