Here are some books I found <br/>\nto promote 2 different theories on dealing with the religious nature <br/>\nof our country today.<br/>\n<br/>\ntheory 1 for younger children<br/>\ndilute the word &quot;god&quot; by presenting all the ancient gods and their <br/>\nmyths to your atheist child emphasizing how at that time people <br/>\nbelieved in these gods so much to kill and be killed for them. <br/>\nExplain that as science advanced we were able to understand more <br/>\nabout the world around us and as we did we realized that we didnt <br/>\nneed to make up gods and goddesses to explain nature. Presenting many <br/>\ngods just makes it so when others talk about god to your child the <br/>\nchild just categorizes it with all the other ones YOU controled the <br/>\ntopic of. They easily dismiss god as a fairy tale.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne part of this theory I am on the fence about is Santa, havent <br/>\ndecided on that one yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ntheory2 for older kids<br/>\n<br/>\nGive them the knowledge to back up their belief system. They need <br/>\nfacts and theory to not fall victim of wanting to follow a crowd by <br/>\nnot being able to defend their thoughts with answers that will stand <br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI found some books for all my childrens age groups at amazon.com and <br/>\ndecided to share my finds with those interested.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1 &quot;The Gods and Goddesses of Olympus&quot; Aliki;  Paperback;  @ $6.95<br/>\neach<br/>\nUsually ships in 24 hours<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n1 &quot;Wise Child&quot; Monica Furlong;  Paperback;  @ $4.99 each<br/>\nUsually ships in 24 hours<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n1 &quot;Egyptian Gods and Goddesses (All Aboard Reading Level 2)&quot; Henry<br/>\nBarker, et al;  Paperback;  @ $3.99 each<br/>\nUsually ships in 24 hours<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n1 &quot;Strega Nona&quot; Tomie De Paola, Tomie dePaola (Illustrator);<br/>\nPaperback;  @ $6.95 each<br/>\nUsually ships in 24 hours<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n1 &quot;Juniper&quot; Monica Furlong;  Paperback;  @ $4.99 each<br/>\nUsually ships in 24 hours<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n1 &quot;Mother Earth&quot; Nancy Luenn, Neil Waldman (Illustrator);  Paperback;<br/>\n @ $5.99 each<br/>\nUsually ships in 24 hours<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n1 &quot;Big Bang&quot; Heather Couper, et al;  Hardcover;  @ $13.56 each<br/>\nUsually ships in 24 hours<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n1 &quot;What About Gods?&quot; Chris Brockman;  Paperback;  @ $10.00 each<br/>\nUsually ships in 2 to 3 days<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n1 &quot;How Do You Know It&#39;s True? : Discovering the Difference Between<br/>\nScience and Superstition&quot; Hyman Ruchlis, Hy Ruchlis;  Paperback;  @<br/>\n$16.00 each<br/>\nUsually ships in 2 to 3 days<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n1 &quot;The Tree of Life : The Wonders of Evolution&quot; Ellen Jackson,<br/>\nJudeanne Winter (Illustrator);  Hardcover;  @ $17.00 each<br/>\nUsually ships in 2 to 3 days<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n1 &quot;All I See Is Part of Me&quot; Chara M.
