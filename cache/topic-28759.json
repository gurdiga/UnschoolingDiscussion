If you wrote a love sonnet, or song, or short story and proudly showed<br/>\nit off to your best friend, and she pointed out all the mistakes you made,<br/>\nhow would you feel? Another way to think about it - dc spends quite a while<br/>\ndrawing a picture of the new baby elephant at the National Zoo, she puts her<br/>\nheart and soul into this painting, adding colorful details such as the spots<br/>\non the baby&#39;s trunk, the bale of hay that the mother elephant eats, the<br/>\nrubber ball that the keepers put in the pen for the baby to play with. She<br/>\nskips over to her Daddy and shows him her beautiful drawing. He says &quot;Very<br/>\nnice dear, but an elephant doesn&#39;t have a long tail like a horse, and babies<br/>\ndon&#39;t have tusks yet, and grown up elephants don&#39;t eat hay. Why don&#39;t you do<br/>\nthis over with the corrections?&quot; Does the dc joyously go back to the table<br/>\nand do it over? I wouldn&#39;t think so.<br/>\nMany years ago when my older brother was a teenager, he wrote a poem at<br/>\nsummer camp and sent it to our Grandpa. Gramps sent him back a letter that<br/>\nenclosed the poem, in which he had highlighted all the spelling and<br/>\ngrammatical mistakes. My brother never again shared his writing with our<br/>\nGramps and still brings this hurt up today. (He is now 48). How sad.<br/>\nElissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28753,"nextTopicId":28755}}
