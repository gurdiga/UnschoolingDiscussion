(can I get a waiver? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Sharon, and I&#39;ve worked for over two years as a <br/>\nhouseparent for boys with &quot;behavioral disabilities&quot; (covers the <br/>\ngamut from ADD/ADHD to schizophrenia and autism).  I&#39;m currently <br/>\nstudying substance abuse in college, and pyschology is one of my <br/>\nmajor fascinations.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I&#39;ve seen, read and researched, ADD/ADHD *is* a real <br/>\ndisease -- but it doesn&#39;t affect nearly the population that is <br/>\ncurrently believed.  Recent research at Duke University suggests <br/>\nthat perhaps ADD is caused by low serotonin levels in the brain (not <br/>\ndopamine, as previously thought). (<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hhmi.org/news/caron2.html)\">http://www.hhmi.org/news/caron2.html)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Beyond your mood, serotonin helps control the flow of thoughts and <br/>\ninformation in your brain, a little like a a cop directing traffic <br/>\nat a busy intersection. When the serotonin system is strong and <br/>\nactive, thoughts flow in a fairly orderly, coherent manner. If <br/>\nserotonin levels greatly drop, thoughts become more scattered and <br/>\nunfocussed. Memory and concentration begin to suffer. Many a person <br/>\nunder severe stress knows this feeling of &#39;thoughts racing through <br/>\nyour head, out of control&#39;.&quot; (from <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thedea.org/yourbrain.html)\">http://thedea.org/yourbrain.html)</a>  (Does this sound familiar?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe danger of using Ritalin to medicate ADD is that, yes, it raises <br/>\nthe serotonin levels, but it also raises dopamine levels.  *That&#39;s* <br/>\nthe main effect of a stimulant, the &quot;buzz&quot; that everybody knows.  <br/>\nThis is why Ritalin abuse is so prevalent in middle- and high-<br/>\nschools: It gives a high very similar to cocaine when snorted.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsequently, long-term Ritalin use has shown similar side-effects <br/>\nas long-term cocaine use.  In &#39;small&#39; doses, though, researchers <br/>\nhope that ritalin usage won&#39;t become overly addicting.  (Liverpool, <br/>\nEngland, has been experimenting with giving low doses of heroin to <br/>\nlong term addicts -- so they can maintain living without withdrawal, <br/>\nbut the dosage *isn&#39;t enough to get high.*  It&#39;s sort of the same <br/>\nidea, and it often works.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people with ADD without Ritalin end up self-medicating (as <br/>\nsomeone mentioned) to make up for their serotonin level deficiency.  <br/>\nThey end up on cocaine or meth.  The studies that show Ritalin users <br/>\nmore likely to end up abusing these two drugs aren&#39;t much good: it&#39;s <br/>\ncorrelational research.  The fact is that people with ADD/ADHD are <br/>\nmore likely to abuse these drugs.  Just because many of them are <br/>\ncurrently on Ritalin doesn&#39;t mean that Ritalin leads into coke <br/>\naddiction.  Those people are missing some chemical in their brains, <br/>\nand they do what they can to make up for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe moral of the story: some people REALLY have ADD/ADHD.  They&#39;re <br/>\nnot just seven-year-old boys who have been asked to sit too long at <br/>\na desk and read &quot;Spot Runs.&quot;  For some of them, Ritalin may be the <br/>\nbest current choice, but it does have bad side effects.  Other, <br/>\nbetter drugs are coming as understanding grows.  The choice is then <br/>\nleft to the parents and the kids: wait for those better drugs, or <br/>\nwork with what we currently have?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Sharon</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65323,"nextTopicId":5317}}
