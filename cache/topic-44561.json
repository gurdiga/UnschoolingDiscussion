My husband is a townie - albeit, small town, but I<br/>\nwould love to live out in the &quot;boondocks&quot;.  We compromise by owning a couple<br/>\nof acres out-of-town but on a state highway.  I think that if you need the<br/>\nblinds drawn to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, then you are<br/>\nnot living in the country!

Takes about 15 minutes to<br/>\nmake and good enough to eat with a spoon.  We also make goat yogurt (which<br/>\nmakes a fantastic strawberry smoothie) and we like the milk just raw and<br/>\nplain as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also raise rabbits and use the meat.  Tastes like the sweetest chicken<br/>\nyou ever had.  I tried to tan the hides this time but I didn&#39;t get the salt<br/>\non thick enough to ward off the flies.  Live and learn.  We just got our<br/>\nbaby chicks so we are trying those for the first time this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;You are living my dream&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is actually a compromise between dh and myself.  He would live in<br/>\nManhattan.  I would live way out in West Texas where you can&#39;t even pick up<br/>\na radio station.  Not surprisingly, we think of  &quot;The Theme from Green<br/>\nAcres&quot; as &quot;our song&quot; and dh refers to our home as &quot;the Haney place.&quot;  We<br/>\njust have a couple of acres but it is plenty of room for what we are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44544,"nextTopicId":44551}}
