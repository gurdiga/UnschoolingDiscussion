Because that might be<br/>\nwhat I&#39;d suggest changing -- if he is feeling powerless then finding ways to<br/>\nempower him (other than violence) can help him learn other ways to get what<br/>\nhe wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger daughter (now 5) went through a phase, I&#39;m thinking it was about<br/>\na year ago, maybe a little less, of hitting her older sister. Mikey<br/>\n(younger) wasn&#39;t much of a talker and Brit (older) can argue the birds out<br/>\nof the trees and always has been able to ;). So, when there was a dispute<br/>\nbetween them, Brit would talk (and talk and talk) and Mikey, increasingly<br/>\npowerless, would finally haul off and punch her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used Sandra&#39;s trick of telling Mikey that if she wanted to hit Brit, to<br/>\nfirst come to me and see if I had any other ideas, and that and just general<br/>\nmaturity and learning to speak up for herself finally solved the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55930,"nextTopicId":56477}}
