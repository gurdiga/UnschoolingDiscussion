Doesn&#39;t fold, though, but not having to trek up <br/>\nand down the stairs to the basement is wonderful. We have a wonderful cleaner <br/>\nnamed Rosa. Once every two weeks we have to de-clutter a little so she can <br/>\nclean, then we go away for a few hours. When we come back the place is <br/>\ncleaner than I&#39;d ever do it, and it smells good. We just love her. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26192,"nextTopicId":26150}}
