There are also examples of how parents can find other people<br/>\nin the community to help their children learn.  We, as  parents, do not<br/>\nneed to be our childrens only teachers.  (How limiting that would be!)<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nNeglect Not The Gift That Is In Thee<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But do you know what, she would do nothing about it if I just looked<br/>\n&gt;at her and said &quot;great honey - study the ocean!&quot;  So what do you do<br/>\n&gt;differently when your child wants to study a subject?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Are you sure she wouldn&#39;t?  And would it matter if she didn&#39;t?  Maybe<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;need to ask more questions.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;98 % sure (she has done this several times - we get the info and she<br/>\n </span></blockquote>never<br/>\ntouches it!).  But that aside, I did learn today that she does not really<br/>\nknow how to ask for the help she needs.  And I have to learn how to<br/>\nlisten<br/>\nand ask the right questions.  Today she said she needed more &quot;structure&quot;<br/>\nwhen  it came to reading.  ?????????  She reads all the time!  So<br/>\nneedless<br/>\nto say alarms went off.  Bottom line (10 minutes and 20 questions later)<br/>\nI<br/>\ndiscovered she was uncertain about how to break down words into proper<br/>\nsyllables and found it tedious - so she would just skip the word when<br/>\nreading.  But hey, I rejoice in the fact that at least it bothers her (it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t use to a year ago!)  So, I&#39;ll do some syllable breakdowns with her<br/>\n(perhaps steer her in the direction of some pages in a book on the<br/>\nsubject)<br/>\nand see what she does with it.  Man she makes me work hard!  :o)<br/>\nIn His Service,<br/>\nLaraine&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAn aside to your daughter&#39;s request for structure in reading:  My<br/>\nfriend&#39;s homeschooled daughter is an avid reader and keeps asking for<br/>\n&quot;spelling tests&quot;.  The irony is that she is also an excellent speller! <br/>\nLOL!<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>\nTry Juno Web: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"&quot;Pam Hartley&quot; &lt;pamhartley@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"YYa-skE105SaliQD1zeEBTymgV6XbJVOsSfXmbsqzCIhO7sgoMc_cDGUAGv5bwxR4ypQHOsoSqZRG2TbYJMtU4Bh83bQ5OOZC3PQ5rXntgU","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: unschooling/unjobbing","postDate":"942098160","msgId":4353,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yODguNDM1My45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4390,"prevInTime":4352,"nextInTime":4354,"topicId":4353,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

ANY child can clearly see that society values reading, hopefully<br/>\nmost of OUR children (unschooling families) also see that reading is a VERY<br/>\nimportant skill from being with their own parents and siblings and seeing<br/>\nthem read.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do children learn to talk? Because they want to get in on what is<br/>\nclearly an important and useful skill. Children will learn to read for the<br/>\nsame reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter Brit is five this coming Sunday. She&#39;s been &quot;learning to read&quot;<br/>\nsince she batted her clenched fists against the paperbacks I read while<br/>\nnursing her. She has learned in fits, starts, stages, dry spells and<br/>\neverything in between. This week, most of her &quot;reading practice&quot; involves:<br/>\n<br/>\na) Watching Blues Clues with her large MagnaDoodle in lap (much handier than<br/>\nthose tiny &quot;Handy Dandy Notebooks&quot; they sell) and writing the words of the<br/>\nclues as Steve shows them on the TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nb) Writing letters to the girls in her dance class, both by asking me &quot;How<br/>\ndo you write &#39;Chelsea&#39;?&quot; and by writing letters purely at random on the<br/>\npaper.<br/>\n<br/>\nc) Pointing out repetitive words in the stories I read to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext week may be completely different, she may not work on anything<br/>\nresembling reading, or she may do nothing but.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4354,"nextTopicId":4337}}
