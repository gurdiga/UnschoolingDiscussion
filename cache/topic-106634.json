Well, Rosie insisted on sleeping with this <br/>\nwoman, and the next day, she insisted that the sheets had to be taken off <br/>\nand cleaned, even though it would be her sleeping in that bed again that <br/>\nnight. Her fingers had cracks, from the bleach water she used to wipe every <br/>\nsurface whenever she passed by. Maybe she had a mental illness...OCD. She <br/>\nwas certainly germophobic.

I mean to say, my mom is a messy extraordinaire, with a <br/>\nperfectionist complex. This means, she won&#39;t do any job unless it can be <br/>\ndone to perfection; thus, many big jobs get ignored, while little jobs are <br/>\ndone to a spit shine. I remember one morning, after I was an adult, and had <br/>\nstayed the night at her house, waking up and having to push aside pots and <br/>\npans in her sink to get a drink of water, while she was standing at the <br/>\nstove in her nighty, scrubbing around the burners with a toothbrush! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I grew up in a house that was a real mess. Ugly. And tougher, because <br/>\nour friends&#39; houses were all tidier than ours, so it was kind of <br/>\nembarassing. And I didn&#39;t learn housekeeping.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, us kids grew up, and all three of us, two girls and a boy, are <br/>\nnaturally tidier, than my mom. It&#39;s like we see the clutter, and it drives <br/>\nus crazy, so we pick it up,while she is able to step over it and ignore it. <br/>\nWe don&#39;t clean because our mom taught us to keep things neat always. We just <br/>\nSEE it, and do something about it, to different levels of tidy.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m watching my kids, the girls especially, look like turning out to <br/>\nhave the messy gene. Both of their rooms are always (and I mean always. Not <br/>\n&quot;usually&quot; but &quot;always.&quot;_) messy, and they both leave stuff out in the <br/>\nkitchen and the front room, and they are both capable of walking right over <br/>\nmesses. And my oldest girl, when she was 10 or so, I asked her to clean the <br/>\nbathroom. When I went in 10 minutes later to check on her, there was stuff <br/>\non the floor, the toilet was untouched, there was some scrubbing powder <br/>\nsprinkled in the tub...and she was polishing the faucet of the sink! With a <br/>\nq-tip! and some rubbing alcohol!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys are both more inclined to pick up, and my girls are like their <br/>\ngramma, which is a good thing, really, because she&#39;s outgoing and fun-loving <br/>\nand friendly. May they have THOSE traits, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, Heidic<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Message: 16<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 15 Jun 2005 15:37:27 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: chores and resentment<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In a message dated 6/15/2005 12:13:06 PM Mountain Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jjjwoolfolk@...\">jjjwoolfolk@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(I won&#39;t  even mention the bacteria experiment that is his bathroom which<br/>\n&gt;is right  off the living room)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Would there have been a bathroom there if you hadn&#39;t had a child?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-=-But my biggest fear is that when he grows up and gets married, instead<br/>\n&gt;of being a man who can clean up after himself like I got from my MIL, he<br/>\n&gt;will be a guy who thinks his job is to sit on the sofa playing video<br/>\n&gt;games while his wife cleans up around him.-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Some of the laziest adults I know were made to do a LOT of chores and heavy<br/>\n&gt;yardwork and wood hauling, etc., when they were kids.
