It took a very long time <br/>\nfor me to call myself a writer, even though I was writing every day! <br/>\nThat schoolish notion of having to prove something is worthy kept re-<br/>\nasserting itself in my head, and this was after I had been <br/>\nunschooling for several years. It&#39;s amazing how long it takes to get <br/>\nrid of some of those old tapes in our heads, isn&#39;t it?? I still find <br/>\nit hard to call myself a photographer, because I have never published <br/>\nany of my photography (well, except the April issue of Home-Ed <br/>\nmagazine, I guess now I am published). But photography is one of my <br/>\nbiggest passions, and I am nothing if not a photographer! <br/>\nI think this one of the worst things that school does to people, it <br/>\nmakes them feel like something needs to be seen and approved of by <br/>\nsome &quot;higher authority&quot; before it is valid. As if no one had ever <br/>\nseen Michelangelo&#39;s work or read Shakespeare&#39;s plays they would be <br/>\nany less brilliant.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; then, i need to just start doing art.  as much as possible.  i need <br/>\n&gt;to find my flow and believe i am an artist.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is one of the hardest things I&#39;ve tried to do as a mom. Finding <br/>\nflow amid the chaos of parenting young kids is certainly a challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; part of  what is holding me back is the awful memories of that <br/>\n&gt;teacher and because art is so personal for me i worry about putting <br/>\n&gt;myself out there and being vulnerable - which i need to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found it really helpful to read the writings of artists, poets, <br/>\nand writers about their art and about how vulnerable they feel about <br/>\nit (even people we take for granted as being at the top of their <br/>\nfield). When you read these famous people&#39;s feelings of insecurity <br/>\nabout their art, I think it makes it easier to see that there is no <br/>\nreal line between &quot;real&quot; artists or writers and &quot;amateurs&quot;. We&#39;re all <br/>\njust people, creating from our hearts, and it&#39;s always difficult to <br/>\nshow that heart to the rest of the world.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; finally, the other thing holding me back is guilt.  the only other <br/>\n&gt;thing i have ever really wanted to do with my life is be a <br/>\n&gt;wife/mother.  so i worry about taking time and money away from my <br/>\n&gt;family to be creative and artistic.  i know that i need to spend <br/>\n&gt;time just for me so i don&#39;t lose myself, but i feel guilty about it <br/>\n&gt;and that blocks creativity too.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I try not to look at it as taking something away from my family when <br/>\nI pursue my own goals. In many ways, it adds to the family to have a <br/>\nperson following their passions. The kids get to see that the love of <br/>\nlearning and creation don&#39;t stop when you reach adulthood, and they <br/>\nget introduced to different worlds that they might not otherwise <br/>\nknow - worlds of galleries and paint shops, or worlds of writer&#39;s <br/>\ngroups or poetry readings. Also, most of the time if I&#39;m off writing, <br/>\nmy husband is getting to spend one-on-one time with the kids. Since <br/>\nhe&#39;s as much of an unschooling parent as I am, it makes sense that he <br/>\nalso would get to share in their day, their journey. He brings things <br/>\nto their relationship that I don&#39;t, and vice versa. He is more likely <br/>\nto do things like throw them on the bed and wrestle around with them, <br/>\nand he&#39;s a whiz at baking chocolate chip cookies. I&#39;m more likely to <br/>\nread books with them, work in the garden together, or go for a bike <br/>\nride. It does them good to have more than one parent&#39;s <br/>\ntalents/abilities/interests in their unschooling lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, taking time out to follow one&#39;s own passions can be taken <br/>\nto an unhealthy extreme. Finding the balancing point is the tough <br/>\npart, but I think when you do find that part, it enhances the family <br/>\nand the unschooling journey of all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":168437188,"authorName":"Andy Holly Clarke","from":"&quot;Andy Holly Clarke&quot; &lt;ahclarke@...&gt;","profile":"hcac","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"art was creativity links","postDate":"1087186954","msgId":95739,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmYwMWM0NTFjNyQzN2ZiYjEwMCQ2NDAxYThjMEB3b3d3YXkuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":95744,"prevInTime":95738,"nextInTime":95740,"topicId":95739,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i guess my general answer (not that one is needed) to this is yes and no... i think i am finally to the place that the idea of selling art, selling something","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-953741136\">i guess my general answer (not that one is needed) to this is yes and no...<br/>\n<br/>\ni think i am finally to the place that the idea of selling art, selling something that i created, doesn&#39;t make me feel like i would be selling my arm or my child.  it used to be completely incomprehensible to me that people were really capable of selling their art.  kwim?<br/>\n<br/>\nart had become a sensitive subject to me.  i had a horrendous art teacher in high school that put down everything i did and made her mistakes and others my fault.  or at least made me believe they were.  <br/>\n<br/>\ni used to believe i was an artist.  i used to be a practicing artist.<br/>\n<br/>\nnow, i haven&#39;t done artistic things in so long that i don&#39;t feel i should call myself an artist.<br/>\n<br/>\ni need to get back to the point where i believe that i am an artist.  that anyone is capable of art. that everyone has an artist inside them.<br/>\n<br/>\nthen, i need to just start doing art.  as much as possible.  i need to find my flow and believe i am an artist.<br/>\n<br/>\nmaybe several years down the road after this i will have the opportunity to sell some of my art, maybe not.  i certainly wouldn&#39;t mind being able to support my family through art<br/>\n<br/>\npart of  what is holding me back is the awful memories of that teacher and because art is so personal for me i worry about putting myself out there and being vulnerable - which i need to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nfinally, the other thing holding me back is guilt.  the only other thing i have ever really wanted to do with my life is be a wife/mother.  so i worry about taking time and money away from my family to be creative and artistic.  i know that i need to spend time just for me so i don&#39;t lose myself, but i feel guilty about it and that blocks creativity too.<br/>\n<br/>\nhope that makes at least a little sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nholly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 5<br/>\n   Date: Fri, 11 Jun 2004 10:33:05 EDT<br/>\n   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: creativity links<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 6/11/04 7:03:00 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahclarke@...\">ahclarke@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  i too dream of being an artist, but fear no one will care or want<br/>\n<br/>\nmy art.  and i fear that i will let other people opinions about my very<br/>\n<br/>\npersonal art affect how i do art. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you do something so passionately that you don&#39;t care if others care, or <br/>\nwant it I think what is likely to happen is that you will infuse the work and <br/>\nthe air around it with that thing that people do care about and want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe statement above sounds like you were thinking you want to make a living <br/>\nas an artist.
