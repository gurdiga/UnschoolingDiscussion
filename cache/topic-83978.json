I could easily have gotten into the same college I attended (small, not very selective, took people who left highschool without getting a diploma), if I had unschooled instead of going to public school.   From there, I could have made the same high grades, gotten  into the same excellent lawschool, gotten the same high-paying job, and left it when my daughter was born! just the same.  Now -- whether I would have wanted to, if I had unschooled, I don&#39;t know.  Maybe -- I was pretty entranced by how much I could get paid for doing my two favorite things (reading and arguing), so I suspect that I might have followed the same initital career path.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, given the combination of (1) the ivy league college recruiters say that they look for quirky bright kids who have found and follow their own interest, and (2) the number of professional women electing to stay home with their children, and my guess that (3) the next &quot;trend&quot; will be for them to unschool, I wonder (only party tongue-in-cheek) whether 25 years from now or so, it will be considered very hard for anyone not &quot;individually educated&quot; (but instead &quot;mass educated&quot; in a public or private school) to get into an ivy league college. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is *not* to say that I think ivy league or corporate jobs are superior -- because in fact I don&#39;t  -- just that sometimes the discussion tends to surround how unschooling kids will follow an unschooling life by eschewing the modern rat race and I don&#39;t think that might sound to someone not unschooling as if the unschoolers choices were precluded from making the choice to go to a conventional college, grad school or job. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: The Scanlons <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, November 06, 2003 10:01 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] how have unschoolers fared after growing up?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;And increasingly, both employers and colleges are<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;looking at a lot of things _besides_ a high-school sheepskin to gauge<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;applicants, as said sheepskins have plummeted in value.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sheepskin?
