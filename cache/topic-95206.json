No matter if it would make me sick or it <br/>\nwas cold or if I really, really hated it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think those times when that would happen and I would try to sneak it to the <br/>\ndogs or wrap it in a napkin, etc., that&#39;s when I would feel ashamed for being <br/>\nsneaky and it ended up being a crappy day or night.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my kids, I don&#39;t choose how much or when or what.  Kids are born knowing <br/>\nwhat they need and when, and mine are still pretty much self limiting.  I can <br/>\nlay out an entire bowl of something they love but when they are done, they <br/>\nare done.  I think this is because they know it isn&#39;t a one time thing.  The <br/>\noption is always there to enjoy things, so they don&#39;t gorge when something is out <br/>\nthat they love.  When they are full, they&#39;re full.  We are by no means rich <br/>\nand the stuff they like isn&#39;t always here but they have other things and know <br/>\nmore is coming soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey only thing I&#39;ve ever asked of the two of them (6 and 2.5) is that they <br/>\ntry things. I don&#39;t make them but I ask that they do it.  My little one was <br/>\nalways interested in bagels and cream cheese and I&#39;d ask if he&#39;d like to try it <br/>\nand he would say, &quot;eewww yukky, NO&quot; and run away.  I knew he&#39;d probably enjoy <br/>\nit but he had to do it on his terms and he finally asked to try it and LOVES <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the back of my mind I feel like maybe sometimes future weight problems and <br/>\neating disorders can come from the stress of controlled eating as a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any thoughts on that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI look at my young children everyday and I am amazed at how they choose for <br/>\nthemselves what they need and/or express openly what they&#39;d like.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like when they are born and we provide for them the breast or bottle at <br/>\nany time, why would that change?  They know then what they want.  When table <br/>\nfoods are introduced and peas or something gets spit out, usually they&#39;re not <br/>\ngiven again for a while because it&#39;s obvious that the baby doesn&#39;t like it.  So <br/>\nwhy, when a child is a bit older, when a parent or adult assumes NOW the <br/>\nchild can understand or be told what to do, that they force these foods?  Is it <br/>\ncontrol?   A friend of mine has been trying desperately to get her new 3 week <br/>\nold baby on a schedule and it flips me out.  I can see wanting to maintain a <br/>\npre-baby life but it&#39;s just not possible after they are here.  The baby is always <br/>\nupset and so is she.  She is not yet working again and may not return at all. <br/>\n How can I help her make this easier?  She is stubborn about the schedule <br/>\nthing but I have told her he&#39;ll have his own schedule and you follow that.
