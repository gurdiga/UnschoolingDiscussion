I live with my chidren closely, and no <br/>\none person is leading.  We arrange to let everyone in the family get lots of <br/>\nopportunity to choose activities and set schedules and it&#39;s working pretty <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Led by a child named Sandra. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi.<br/>\nI&#39;m forty nine.
