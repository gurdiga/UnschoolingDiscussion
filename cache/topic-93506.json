They want others to say &quot;Ooooh, you&#39;re an unschooler <br/>\njust like WE are.  Welcome, welcome, how&#39;s your dog?  What kind of flowers are <br/>\nin your yard?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t want to change.  They might not even want to unschool.  They are <br/>\nneedy of affirmation and they&#39;re not wanting to figure out what their audience <br/>\nreally wants.   So (maybe, in Howard Gardner&#39;s kind of terms) having a lack of <br/>\ninterest in or inability to really look at themselves or others, they get <br/>\nangry if others can and are looking deeply and carefully and clearly at <br/>\nthemselves and others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people out there (women, mostly) who will tell other people <br/>\nwhatever nice, positive thing they want to hear.   That can only really be done if <br/>\nthe speaker honestly, truly, doesn&#39;t know or care about the person in any way <br/>\nwhatsoever, or if they&#39;re just in the habit of not looking but just &quot;being <br/>\npleasant&quot; and agreeing with anyone anytime.   Once you&#39;re out of the room, good <br/>\nluck.  But while you&#39;re there, you&#39;re a friend, and they&#39;ll groom and stroke.    <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s a mothering instinct gone on beyond.  In some cases it&#39;s <br/>\ncowardice.  In other cases, though, it&#39;s that element of deep lack of self esteem and <br/>\nconviction that is the central theme of The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes.  Will you be <br/>\nhonest even if others might be offended?  Will you believe that others see <br/>\nsomething, and agree that you see it, just to go along with the group?  Do you <br/>\ndoubt your own convictons and perceptions so much that you&#39;ll say &quot;Ooooh, yeah, <br/>\nthat&#39;s nice.  You&#39;re right!  I hadn&#39;t thought of that.  You&#39;re so smart.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut all those mental health issues aside, this list exists so that <br/>\nunschoolers and those interested in unschooling can discuss how and why it works and <br/>\nwhat can keep it from working as well as it could.  It&#39;s not a group therapy <br/>\nsession (though some figure out how to take comfort and growth-clues and to <br/>\nprocess some of their childhood stuff) and it&#39;s not a ladies&#39; teaparty where we say <br/>\n&quot;nice hat! lovely weather&quot; out front and &quot;did you see that stupid hat?&quot; later. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nIf someone writes here that she&#39;s been thinking, and she&#39;s sorry she ever <br/>\nspanked kids, those who are NOT wanting to be sorry they spanked their kids, or <br/>\nstill do, might think she&#39;s putting her ideals on them.  I could make a dozen <br/>\nother examples.  But the only way to avoid that is for us all to give up ideals <br/>\nand just put all our kids in school, discipline the way our moms or neighbors <br/>\ndo/did,  give them allowance on par with neighbor kids (and withhold it <br/>\nwhenever the hell we want to because they&#39;re our kids and it&#39;s our money), have a <br/>\nbedtime like the neighbors, and then all the neighbors will be happier and we <br/>\nwon&#39;t have to think.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was tried already.  It was the 1950&#39;s and early 60&#39;s.   There was a <br/>\nyuppie resurgence in the 1980&#39;s.
