I&#39;ll save this one for my daughter (i.e., LOL, <br/>\nsend it to her e-mail addy, and yes we DO live in the same house, I&#39;m ALWAYS <br/>\ndoing this, geezsh)! when she returns from her trip.  She&#39;s always (since I can <br/>\nremember) been really into Dinasours/Palenontolgy, so this trip she&#39;s on is <br/>\nperfect for her.  LOL, guess what we&#39;ll be studying a lot about this year?  And <br/>\nwe can add Jack Horner to the list for reading!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;m just hoping my OLD video camera is working for her.  We haven&#39;t used <br/>\nthe thing in years (in fact, I thought the battery charger was lost, till be <br/>\nmoved, and it suddenly showed up in the new place, go figure, I sure don&#39;t <br/>\nremember seeing it when things were packed).  I know, if it does work, we can <br/>\nhave her &quot;movie&quot; memories transferred to VHS, now I&#39;m wondering if we can then <br/>\nhave it transferred to DVD.  If so, it will probably have to go to VHS first, <br/>\nthen DVD.  I can only hope for the best!<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thanks for the heads up for additional reading!  Sounds great!  <br/>\nAmazing the stuff we learn on our own because of our own driven interests, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\nWe forfeit three-fouths of ourselves in order to be like other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Arthur Schopenhauer~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77921,"nextTopicId":77924}}
