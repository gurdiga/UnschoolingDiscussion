Girl Doll) and<br/>\nhaving read all the books about her. <br/>\nI haven&#39;t been very helpful in her pursuit of great historical fiction<br/>\nregarding this era in American history (we do not cover it here in<br/>\nCanada...esp. at elementary levels). She is particularly interested in the<br/>\n1800&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has any great links or (even better) some good titles of<br/>\nchildrens novels about this period please let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,,,<br/>\nBrooke in BC<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brynlee@...\">brynlee@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5637,"nextTopicId":5653}}
