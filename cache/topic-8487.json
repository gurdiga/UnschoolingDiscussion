Reading all you <br/>\ncan get your hands on is a great idea; the more you read, the better it will <br/>\nbe.  Since you &quot;sound&quot; like you may want to include a bit of structure with <br/>\nthe Biblical aspect, know that this can occur with unschooling, too.  Some <br/>\npeople (including myself) consider themselves &quot;Christian Unschoolers&quot;, and <br/>\n/or Eclectic Homeschoolers, where you do not necessarily use a pre-pkg <br/>\ncurriculum, but opt instead to use a &quot;bit of this and that&quot;, inconjunction <br/>\nwith what topics your children are learning about .  Unschoolers often use <br/>\ntextbooks, but use them when relevant to the learning already under way, <br/>\ninstead of using them to initiate the learning, as schools do.  There is no <br/>\none best way to home educate; you will just need to tryout what seems <br/>\ncomfortable for you and your kids, and adjust as needed,  and there may be <br/>\nlots of fine tuning as you go along.  Many people on this list have a lot of <br/>\nexperience and will be able to give you some good advice!  I found a lot of <br/>\ngreat info just by surfing the web and reading articles-- there are many, <br/>\nmany ,many!
