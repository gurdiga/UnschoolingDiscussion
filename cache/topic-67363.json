He said first <br/>\noff he thought it was funny that we would be talking about dirty laundry.  <br/>\nLOL.  But seriously...he said he did not feel controlled or ruled.  He said <br/>\nhe has developed a system and does not want me to go through his clothes.  He <br/>\nsaid he knows which are clean and which are dirty and when they are Dirty <br/>\nenough they will get into the basket.  He says if I wash his dress clothes <br/>\ntoo much the pants will start to wear out at the pockets very fast.  And he <br/>\nkeeps his &quot;working outside&quot; clothes for quite a while before he washes them.  <br/>\nLOL.  He says he has plenty of time to separate his clothes and just <br/>\nappreciates that I don&#39;t mind doing the laundry as he hates it.
