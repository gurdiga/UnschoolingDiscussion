But while I&#39;ve been<br/>\n </span></blockquote>on vacation I&#39;ve had the opportunity to review a neat homeschooling<br/>\ndocumentary and wanted to let you know about it.  It&#39;s called, &quot;Inventing A<br/>\nGirl&quot; and it is a charming depiction of the life of a mostly unschooled<br/>\ngirl.  For those of you who do &quot;follow the child&quot; it is affirming to watch<br/>\nthe film.  It might also help relatives and friends to understand this<br/>\neducational lifestyle.  I<br/>\nthink the film would be a very worthwhile purchase for support groups -- as<br/>\nit could be be viewed at a monthly meeting or be loaned out to new members<br/>\nseeking information about homeschooling. It would be a great addition to<br/>\nHome Study or Independent Study libraries and resource centers as well.
