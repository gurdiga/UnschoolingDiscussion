These migraines are excruciating, and much<br/>\ndifferent than headaches. I usually lose normal vision, can&#39;t think and<br/>\nbecome increasingly unable to function.   I found that eliminating the<br/>\nfoods I was allergic to (dairy products, eggs, beef, peas, and others)<br/>\ncertainly helped.  But I have also found that my body will develop new<br/>\nintolerances if I overdo it -- particularly with anything having to do<br/>\nwith animals, and food additives.  In my experience, the migraine comes<br/>\nnot only as an allergic reaction, but  from unalleviated physical,<br/>\nemotional, and/or mental stress.  I find that I can completely avoid<br/>\nmigraines by avoiding all my allergy foods, food additives and<br/>\nchemicals, caffeine and wine; by regularly exercising and doing any deep<br/>\nbreathing work (such as meditation or singing or t&#39;ai chi) and dealing<br/>\nwith stress in an effective way.  HA!<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I am not actually able to do this (yet?), and get the odd<br/>\nmigraine.  I have found that acupuncture and/or self-accupressure work<br/>\nwell, combined with secluding myself in a dark quiet room and breathing<br/>\nreally deeply, in alleviating the pain.   In emergencies, when I<br/>\nabsolutely have to function, I use coffee as a potent drug.  Since I<br/>\ndon&#39;t drink it otherwise, and don&#39;t take any other drug, strong coffee<br/>\ntakes away my migraine temporarily and enables me to at least see and<br/>\nmove  until I can clean up my act and get someplace where I can take<br/>\ncare of myself.   But I then have to deal with the accumulated side<br/>\neffects of coffee, too, and it can be a slippery slope that just leads<br/>\nto more imbalance, so I don&#39;t really recommend this.  It just works for<br/>\nme in emergencies, as it thins the blood flow to the brain, to put it<br/>\nextremely simply.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Ron and Stephanie","from":"&quot;Ron and Stephanie&quot; &lt;ronandstphanie@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"lveuDOy-ltVptRAivDJtJ-Pss-jD9xgeT31tzMvmUnxNLXDLuWV3zwAPbAYJX5i0Fg8L9s8VEODZe_fT5Ob1yoxA2rDxxMZJIeu6usKcvJgWsLEnlkV7","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: migraines","postDate":"951417654","msgId":6756,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MzIuNjc1Ni45NTkyNjk3NDdAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6752,"nextInTopic":6779,"prevInTime":6755,"nextInTime":6757,"topicId":6752,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 10 yos got a terrible headache was shortly after eating hotdogs.
