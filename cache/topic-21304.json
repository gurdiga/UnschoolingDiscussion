My DH&#39;s psychiatric MD (the one that prescribes medicine) was also into alternative medicines as well as the traditional meds like Prozac.  He wanted him to take a regimen of carbohydrate pills that was formulated to be broken down slowly and keep the level of<br/>\n&gt; seratonin  up.  The idea was that certain carbohydrates make seratonin and if you kept the levels up, the patient would not get depressed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think that my husband really doubts our unschooling ways when he is depressed or nearing a depressive episode. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21299,"nextTopicId":21317}}
