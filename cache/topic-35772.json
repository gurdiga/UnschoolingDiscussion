Spelling is  much more difficult to learn and I believe<br/>\nmore time consuming. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd less important!  There&#39;s no reason for it to be learned in two years <br/>\ninstead of over twenty years.  What&#39;s the big rush?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Spelling is a different matter, also, words that were unusual and had<br/>\nmany syllables were very hard to read correctly.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot for everyone.  Holly, who&#39;s a fearful reader, read &quot;responsibilities&quot; the <br/>\nother day, because it made sense in the context of what she was reading and <br/>\nshe knows the word already.  Learning to read before one has a large <br/>\nvocabulary might be part of the whole reading problem in schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Like my last name,<br/>\nCifuentes  VERY FEW adults can read my last name correctly and usually<br/>\nadd a &quot;qu&quot; sound where the &quot;f&quot; is.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut no English phonics rules will help one bit.<br/>\nI could read it, but I grew up in a 70% Hispanic area, surrounded by <br/>\nCeballeses and Maldonados and Maestases and Abeytas and lots and LOTS of <br/>\nTrujillos and Martinezes.  Fresquez and Gonzales were easy reading for us <br/>\nearly on.  Not because of English rules, but from recognition and repetition.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;But the whole point of my writing this is about SPELLLING. I still<br/>\nhaven&#39;t heard more on SPELLING that makes sense. Remember, there seems<br/>\nto be an agreement here that folks that need a bit of walking through<br/>\nand clicking with the idea slowly get that chance. Can&#39;t my questions be<br/>\nsimply answered as to a method when it comes to SPELLING?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what people are saying is that unschooled kids can and do learn to <br/>\nspell well without a method.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Back to my original question, then how do they learn SPELLING RULES that<br/>\nwill help them SPELL?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey learn rules gradually, if at all, and if they don&#39;t need help spelling, <br/>\nthey wouldn&#39;t have needed the rules anyway.  Some people don&#39;t know the rules <br/>\nand spell well.  Some people passed many tests in school on the rules, and <br/>\nyet don&#39;t spell well.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;There are lots of complex historical reasons that the same word became<br/>\n&quot;kirk&quot; in Scotland.  But the fact remains that kids learn to pronounce things<br/>\nin their native dialect (and other dialects later, in many cases) and then<br/>\nto spell in standard ways by various means. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;My concern is with the ENGLISH language. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey speak English in Scotland.<br/>\nSo what is your spelling-rules explanation for the pronunciation of &quot;church&quot;? <br/>\nAnd is it going to tie into the history of the word and the splitting off of <br/>\nthe major medieval English dialects to account for &quot;kirk&quot; (a variant of the <br/>\nsame word)?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Didn&#39;t you ever look at something and say &quot;Oh!

The whole ebonics controversy<br/>\nin Oakland centered on labeling who spoke AAVE as ESL/BLE (English as a<br/>\nSecond Language/Bi-Lingual Education) students, which allowed them to get<br/>\nfederal funding for programs that allow them to be taught in AAVE (much<br/>\nas monolingual Spanish-speaking children are sometimes taught academics<br/>\nin Spanish while they learn English).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thinking is not so much not to interfere with their &quot;native tongue&quot;,<br/>\nbut to ensure that they are actually learning, rather than just being<br/>\n&quot;immersed&quot; in a langauge they don&#39;t understand.

When she first started reading, words she didn&#39;t recognize were<br/>\nsort of acknowledged and skipped through - she knew that Tia Dolores was<br/>\nJosefina&#39;s aunt, but when she wanted to tell me about her she called her<br/>\n&quot;tilldoris&quot;, and wasn&#39;t really concerned about how close or far that was<br/>\nfrom the actual word. <br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed that the more she read, the more she could pronounce things<br/>\ncorrectly. I think she intuited the generalities of phonetic<br/>\npronounciation through being exposed to them - if you notice that every<br/>\nword beginning with the letter &quot;t&quot; starts with the sound /t/, you can<br/>\nbegin to expect that to be true. Occasionally I&#39;ve pointed out a<br/>\nphonetic<br/>\ngenerality when she&#39;s asked about spelling, I remember telling her at<br/>\none<br/>\npoint that the /ng/ sound was almost always spelled &quot;ing&quot;... but most of<br/>\nthose she&#39;s just figured out for herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t foolproof - the other day she was telling me how she loved the<br/>\nname she pronounced &quot;Jack-wee-ess&quot; for  a boy, and as we talked it<br/>\neventually became clear that she had read the name &quot;Jacques&quot; and<br/>\nmispronounced it... although he way would make perfect sense if it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t<br/>\na French word. So we talked some about French words and French<br/>\nphonetics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also remember that she knew how to spell Jacques from reading it...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, sort of off the subject, but you seem to have a pretty skewed<br/>\nunderstanding of the Whole Language theory. Whole Language certainly<br/>\nincludes seeing  words, reading them, playing with them...when done<br/>\ncorrectly, it even includes some basic phonics, although the phonics<br/>\nknowledge usually comes after the word itself has meaning. Words are<br/>\nseen<br/>\nmore holistically, not as phonemes stuck together but as individual<br/>\nunits<br/>\nof meaning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd no schools teach &quot;Ebonics&quot;, at least none of which I&#39;m aware. I<br/>\nbelieve there&#39;s still a difference of opinion over whether it&#39;s a<br/>\ndialect<br/>\nor a language. However, it is in no way inferior to what you or I speak.<br/>\nI can&#39;t speak &quot;Ebonics&quot; (African-American Vernacular English is the<br/>\npreferred term, or AAVE). Linguistic systems are not inferior or<br/>\nsuperior, they just *are*. AAVE has its own unique grammar and<br/>\npronouciation rules, different than ours but just as definite and<br/>\ncomplete, maybe more so. For example, standard english has no<br/>\ngrammatical<br/>\nway to differentiate actions done habitually with those done once,<br/>\nexcept<br/>\nof course by adding &quot;habitually&quot; or some other awkward construction. In<br/>\nAAVE, the word &quot;be&quot; denotes a habitual activity, so saying &quot;She be<br/>\nreading books&quot; means &quot;She habitually reads books&quot;, whereas &quot;She reading<br/>\nbooks&quot; means &quot;She&#39;s reading books right now&quot;. I wish I could speak<br/>\nAAVE,<br/>\nalthough I&#39;d probably look pretty dumb doing it as a white girl... kinda<br/>\nlike the old woman in the movie &quot;Airplane&quot; who spoke jive...;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI heard John McWhorter talking about this on NPR one day. I&#39;ve read a<br/>\ncouple of his books, too, and they&#39;re fascinating...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, it&#39;s nice to be fluent in standard english, especially when<br/>\nyou&#39;re applying for jobs and stuff, but I&#39;m not worried about it, I know<br/>\nit&#39;ll happen... but then, I worry very little anyway. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

It stands to reason<br/>\nthat there are many reasons to leave, crime is a huge motivator!<br/>\n <br/>\nPhonics is just a tool.  I learned by sight reading.  We used to draw<br/>\nboxes <br/>\naround the letters, following their shapes.  Then I switched states and <br/>\nschools and did phonics.  I could already read at that point, and so<br/>\nspent <br/>\ntwo years doing phonics exercises just because that&#39;s what we had to do<br/>\nto <br/>\n&quot;get a good grade in reading.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;,,<br/>\nI like to think that Phonics is more for &quot;spelling&quot; purpose than<br/>\nreading. Many children read wonderfully, but spelling is a different<br/>\nmatter entirely. Spelling is  much more difficult to learn and I believe<br/>\nmore time consuming. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhether a school uses look-say or phonics, each individual child learns<br/>\nto <br/>\nread, somehow, in his own way, either with the assistance of or in spite<br/>\nof <br/>\nthe intervention of, the school&#39;s &quot;method &quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nSpelling is a different matter, also, words that were unusual and had<br/>\nmany syllables were very hard to read correctly. Like my last name,<br/>\nCifuentes  VERY FEW adults can read my last name correctly and usually<br/>\nadd a &quot;qu&quot; sound where the &quot;f&quot; is. But when I break down my name into<br/>\nsyllables (not a whole language thing to do), they get it fine! :O)<br/>\n<br/>\n You&#39;re preaching to a choir which has moved on beyond what you&#39;re<br/>\nsaying, for <br/>\nthe most part. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd I&#39;m still thinking anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Look at the work of Noah Webster! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of the people here are former teachers, or current teachers, and<br/>\nsome <br/>\nare researchers, some are counselors who have studied development, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve looked at lots and tons of studies and theories.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>\n <br/>\nI understood that to be so before I posted. :O)Thanks for the reminder.<br/>\nBut I was discussing Webster&#39;s work and how it helps us even today when<br/>\nit comes to language arts. His work is FACT, not theory. It&#39;s a fact<br/>\nthat our spelling today is standard, where before, it was not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd through all that, there is much practical belief and experience<br/>\npointing <br/>\ntoward unschooling as a rich, viable plan of action.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nBut the whole point of my writing this is about SPELLLING. I still<br/>\nhaven&#39;t heard more on SPELLING that makes sense. Remember, there seems<br/>\nto be an agreement here that folks that need a bit of walking through<br/>\nand clicking with the idea slowly get that chance. Can&#39;t my questions be<br/>\nsimply answered as to a method when it comes to SPELLING?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile unschooling, there is no need to use ANY spelling program.<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to my original question, then how do they learn SPELLING RULES that<br/>\nwill help them SPELL?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of complex historical reasons that the same word became<br/>\n&quot;kirk&quot; <br/>\nin Scotland.  But the fact remains that kids learn to pronounce things<br/>\nin <br/>\ntheir native dialect (and other dialects later, in many cases) and then<br/>\nto <br/>\nspell in standard ways by various means. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nMy concern is with the ENGLISH language. What they will use to<br/>\ncommunicate with in written form as adults which is STANDARD.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody needs to know those particular items in order to know how to read<br/>\nor <br/>\nspell.  If it&#39;s fascinating to you, that&#39;s great and I&#39;m sure your kids<br/>\nwill <br/>\npick up on your enthusiasm.  But if you&#39;re telling yourself or your<br/>\nchildren <br/>\nthat that is the ONLY way they could have learned, that those things<br/>\nwere <br/>\nnecessary, or that without you and your noble sacrifice to teach them<br/>\nthey <br/>\ncould never have learned to read, you&#39;ll be setting you and them up to<br/>\nthink <br/>\nthat now you&#39;ll have to find the perfect method for other subjects.<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nWell, I wouldn&#39;t call it a &quot;noble sacrifice&quot; but I am glad that I do<br/>\nkeep them with me because we are a family. I was just saying in the<br/>\nabove, wouldn&#39;t it be neat to just &quot;know&quot; those things to make it<br/>\neasier. Didn&#39;t you ever look at something and say &quot;Oh! Now I get it, I<br/>\nwish I&#39;d known that a while ago!&quot; Same thing...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if they meet my kids and see that they can spell no better and read<br/>\nno <br/>\nfaster than kids who learned by wilder, more everyday means, then what?<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo different than me meeting adult who learned any given subject<br/>\ndifferent than me. I&#39;m inspired by them. :O)<br/>\nNot that I know all that much either. But I&#39;m merely exploring spelling<br/>\nrules and their validity. <br/>\nAnd I&#39;m not comparing our children here, or anywhere. I don&#39;t care to<br/>\nworry about comparisons, but what tools are beneficial for MY kids and<br/>\ndoes anyone else feel the way I do. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can find a population with leisure and no history of forced<br/>\neducation <br/>\nat an age before they&#39;re ready to understand reading, then maybe you&#39;ll<br/>\nhave <br/>\na control group for your theory. <br/>\nI don&#39;t think that it&#39;s &quot;my theory&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t get the point.  &quot;Affects,&quot; not &quot;effect,&quot; but I still don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand <br/>\nif you&#39;re saying that because not all Americans can read contract law or<br/>\n<br/>\nlegalese....  You lost me. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>\n <br/>\nI have a thought that those who do not read well or spell well have a<br/>\ndisadvantage. Only, that&#39;s how I feel right now. Maybe that might<br/>\nchange? I&#39;m just exploring the idea right now.<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Spanglish,&quot; it is in Northern New Mexico.  People who use mixed phrases<br/>\nKNOW <br/>\nit&#39;s just for speaking and not for writing. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\nWell, typically, where we are from, 45 mins from the border, it&#39;s<br/>\nTex-Mex on the American side.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\nMexicans over the border just say &quot;Spanish&quot; as does the Mexicans in the<br/>\narea of Texas I&#39;m from. I&#39;m not so sure about the entire state of Texas.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut either way, it&#39;s NOTHING like the Spanish that is spoken in<br/>\nCalifornia, or Spain or Cuba or any other country. Dialects are rampant,<br/>\neven with the same region. It&#39;s confusing to a &quot;Gringa&quot; (slang for white<br/>\nperson, where I&#39;m from, but might be an insult to someone in another<br/>\nregion?) like me to learn, especially in NC! Where I may learn the<br/>\nSpanish presented to me by the local of this area, but then again, when<br/>\nI go home. They don&#39;t understand me  and I&#39;m still unfamiliar with what<br/>\nsome of their words are. (I really should remember more, but for some<br/>\nreason, I just didn&#39;t get interested as a youngster.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; <br/>\n<br/>\nI just feel like having them read isn&#39;t enough. They must also write,<br/>\n<br/>\nand spell and do those things very well. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you feel you must HAVE them read, write and spell, then they are<br/>\ndoing <br/>\nwhat you decide to do, on your terms, to your standards.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope for your sake and theirs you&#39;ll lighten up before they&#39;re not<br/>\nhaving <br/>\nany fun at all. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI do not approach them the way I approach the list at all! I&#39;m sure that<br/>\nwhat I&#39;m saying may be &quot;wordy&quot; or whatever one would dub it. My children<br/>\nlove to learn English, and SPANISH! <br/>\nWe just have to learn what is available and my husband&#39;s input is a help<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n <br/>\nPlease don&#39;t assume that those who get excited about learning methods<br/>\nare burning out their children, I believe that I can have some really<br/>\ngood ideas and they help us come up with some good ones too. I haven&#39;t<br/>\nbeen the &quot;heavy&quot; since we started looking closely at the English<br/>\nlanguage, and my children find it fascinating too. Why is it considered<br/>\n&quot;not fun&quot; to learn about SPELLING? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

When she first started reading, words she didn&#39;t recognize were<br/>\nsort of acknowledged and skipped through - she knew that Tia Dolores was<br/>\nJosefina&#39;s aunt, but when she wanted to tell me about her she called her<br/>\n&quot;tilldoris&quot;, and wasn&#39;t really concerned about how close or far that was<br/>\nfrom the actual word. <br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed that the more she read, the more she could pronounce things<br/>\ncorrectly. I think she intuited the generalities of phonetic<br/>\npronounciation through being exposed to them - if you notice that every<br/>\nword beginning with the letter &quot;t&quot; starts with the sound /t/, you can<br/>\nbegin to expect that to be true. Occasionally I&#39;ve pointed out a phonetic<br/>\ngenerality when she&#39;s asked about spelling, I remember telling her at one<br/>\npoint that the /ng/ sound was almost always spelled &quot;ing&quot;... but most of<br/>\nthose she&#39;s just figured out for herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t foolproof - the other day she was telling me how she loved the<br/>\nname she pronounced &quot;Jack-wee-ess&quot; for  a boy, and as we talked it<br/>\neventually became clear that she had read the name &quot;Jacques&quot; and<br/>\nmispronounced it... although he way would make perfect sense if it wasn&#39;t<br/>\na French word. So we talked some about French words and French phonetics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also remember that she knew how to spell Jacques from reading it...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, sort of off the subject, but you seem to have a pretty skewed<br/>\nunderstanding of the Whole Language theory. Whole Language certainly<br/>\nincludes seeing  words, reading them, playing with them...when done<br/>\ncorrectly, it even includes some basic phonics, although the phonics<br/>\nknowledge usually comes after the word itself has meaning. Words are seen<br/>\nmore holistically, not as phonemes stuck together but as individual units<br/>\nof meaning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd no schools teach &quot;Ebonics&quot;, at least none of which I&#39;m aware. I<br/>\nbelieve there&#39;s still a difference of opinion over whether it&#39;s a dialect<br/>\nor a language. However, it is in no way inferior to what you or I speak.<br/>\nI can&#39;t speak &quot;Ebonics&quot; (African-American Vernacular English is the<br/>\npreferred term, or AAVE). Linguistic systems are not inferior or<br/>\nsuperior, they just *are*. AAVE has its own unique grammar and<br/>\npronouciation rules, different than ours but just as definite and<br/>\ncomplete, maybe more so. For example, standard english has no grammatical<br/>\nway to differentiate actions done habitually with those done once, except<br/>\nof course by adding &quot;habitually&quot; or some other awkward construction. In<br/>\nAAVE, the word &quot;be&quot; denotes a habitual activity, so saying &quot;She be<br/>\nreading books&quot; means &quot;She habitually reads books&quot;, whereas &quot;She reading<br/>\nbooks&quot; means &quot;She&#39;s reading books right now&quot;. I wish I could speak  AAVE,<br/>\nalthough I&#39;d probably look pretty dumb doing it as a white girl... kinda<br/>\nlike the old woman in the movie &quot;Airplane&quot; who spoke jive...;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI heard John McWhorter talking about this on NPR one day.

Children were found to naturally try to connect the<br/>\nsound, but without the &quot;rules&quot; they were unsuccessful, especially in the<br/>\narea of spelling. The term &quot;inventive spelling&quot; or &quot;phonetical spelling&quot;<br/>\n(what I call incorrect spelling) was birthed after &quot;whole language&quot; was<br/>\nintroduced into our school systems. Children that heard words that were<br/>\nonly spoken to them and not written down, (which they are exposed to<br/>\nmore audio than visual in a given day) were not able to spell the new<br/>\nwords spoken to them because they had no &quot;plan of action&quot; so to speak.<br/>\n <br/>\n The American alphabet is phonetical. There are certain sounds and rules<br/>\nthat go together. Every &quot;symbol&quot; has a sound and a rule: like the &quot;q&quot;<br/>\nwill always be accompanied by the &quot;u&quot;, and USUALLY the &quot;e&quot; ending will<br/>\nmake a vowel in a syllable &quot;say its name sound.&quot;<br/>\nThe Chinese use &quot;characters&quot; to read, (not even the Chinese know the<br/>\nextent of their written language! They tend to &quot;max out.&quot;) I feel that<br/>\nmy children will be handicapped in the area of written language if I<br/>\ndon&#39;t take the time to gently introduce their language and its rules to<br/>\nthem. I prefer that they don&#39;t read the English language the way the<br/>\nChinese read the characters of their language. Eventually I will have to<br/>\nend their frustration by giving them the rules anyway, they make perfect<br/>\nsense and they are proven. So my children find them valuable.        <br/>\n <br/>\nI didn&#39;t get that &quot;spelling is proven not to be natural&quot; from a spelling<br/>\nbook :o). It was research done by, not an educator at all, but a<br/>\nneurologist. Dr. Orton and his sidekick Gillingham researched that the<br/>\nwritten language is best learned MULTISENSORILY. In other words, using<br/>\nALL the senses rather than just sight, or sound, but phonetics with even<br/>\nsaying sounds allowed to oneself while writing the letter symbols. His<br/>\nwork showed that the brain doesn&#39;t really ready &quot;letters&quot; but lines,<br/>\nparts of lines, circles and part of circles and that those lines and<br/>\ncircles trigger the brain to retrieve sounds as the child remembers them<br/>\nwhen creating a letter. <br/>\n <br/>\nLook at the work of Noah Webster! What a great man, he took the time to<br/>\n&quot;format&quot; our language so that the written word would be clearly<br/>\nunderstood by all people. He, in essence, wrote a curriculum, the<br/>\nreference book, the dictionary which is where we go for spelling rules<br/>\nas well as sounds. He backed up his work with the renown &quot;Blue Back<br/>\nSpeller.&quot; I don&#39;t care for this type of book really, but some parts of<br/>\nit are redeemable, this particular book seems to be merely a &quot;crash<br/>\ncourse&quot;. In his day, those who were extremely literate understood why<br/>\nwords were formed the way that they were, including the Latin and Greek<br/>\nroots. It was taught in some early educational institutions with zeal.<br/>\nUnlike today, where spelling programs are wimpy and flat, no real<br/>\ninformation at all to use for further guidance or to perk curiosity and<br/>\nin fact create frustration.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome phonograms have more that one sound, even the multiple letter ones<br/>\nlike &quot;ch&quot; which can be used as &quot;ch&quot; (hard sound) &quot;k&quot; and &quot;sh&quot;. There is<br/>\na reason we pronounce &quot;church&quot; the way that we do, though I won&#39;t get<br/>\ninto it unless you want to. :o)&lt;bg&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI think it&#39;s important for my children to know all the sounds of the<br/>\nshort &quot;i&quot; sound, and when to use a &quot;y&quot; and that there are only three<br/>\nwords in the English language that end in &quot;u&quot; impromptu, you and thou.<br/>\nKnowing that helps them to spell better. The word &quot;blue&quot; can&#39;t be<br/>\nspelled &quot;b-l-u&quot; because they now know that only those THREE words are<br/>\nspelled with &quot;u&quot; so they must investigate one of the FIVE silent &quot;e&quot;<br/>\nrules.<br/>\nThey have learned these rules over the space of just more than a year.<br/>\nOnly FIVE rules for &quot;e&quot; in a YEAR? Yes, we take if VERY easy and work as<br/>\nwe feel it&#39;s time to move on. They have learned that research and<br/>\nreferencing can produce great things for them when they want to expand<br/>\ntheir abilities. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe world is full of illiterate people. People that WANT to learn to<br/>\nread, but have to learn differently, maybe multisensorily? We are<br/>\nvirtually surrounded by the written word everywhere. If it were true<br/>\nthat &quot;whole language&quot; was successful then there should be NO illiteracy<br/>\nat all, people would just pick up reading and spelling skills just by<br/>\nwalking down a very busy Market St.  Remember, there are many different<br/>\nlearning types, not just visual. It has been reiterated over and again<br/>\nthat 80% of the population isn&#39;t visual, but AUDITORY.<br/>\nAnd again, shows the failure of &quot;whole language.&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband didn&#39;t learn English until he was 12. He is Mexican, born in<br/>\nSouth Texas. He is second generation born in America on his mother&#39;s<br/>\nside, first on his father&#39;s side. He went to ps there. He really<br/>\nstruggles because when the dilapidated system that he was in decided to<br/>\nteach him &quot;whole language&quot; instead of phonics and virtually NO grammar,<br/>\nhe became stumped as an adult. We have a CD Rom that he enjoys very much<br/>\nand is excited about how much he has improved over a short couple of<br/>\nmonths. <br/>\nHe struggled with spelling tremendously, but when we talk about new<br/>\nwords, I use my material to expose him to rules that now make sense, so<br/>\nhe gains knowledge and he is more comfortable with being able to write<br/>\nand express himself the way he should. He has to do plenty of writing<br/>\nbeing in the Navy!<br/>\n <br/>\nIn DC where our laws are made, legislation gets passed through that<br/>\neffects ALL our lives due to the fact that the average American doesn&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand the English language. When people don&#39;t understand what they<br/>\nare reading, the average person avoids or ignores the material.<br/>\nIt&#39;s easier and &quot;who has time anyway?&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s not my calling to know<br/>\nit&quot; and really what has happened is the skills were NEVER developed. <br/>\n <br/>\nDoes it matter that my children gain a systematic approach (one that<br/>\nisn&#39;t overbearing or redundant)? I do think so. Just as I don&#39;t want my<br/>\nchildren to think &quot;Ebonics&quot; is a language that will help them to succeed<br/>\nin life, (maybe in a town that reads, writes and speaks Ebonics) but not<br/>\nthe rest of the world, I don&#39;t want them thinking that not having the<br/>\nbest written communication possible is essential for adult living.<br/>\n <br/>\nRemember that I&#39;m USing the &quot;Ebonics&quot; as merely an example of our school<br/>\nsystem&#39;s caving in and not teaching the English language as it is, but a<br/>\ncrippling second rate form of expression, same applies to Tex-Mex that<br/>\nmy husband learned in ps. You will not see either of these language<br/>\nexpressions broadly based in our English speaking American culture,<br/>\ncausing those who learn these to be in essence, handicapped in<br/>\ncommunication.<br/>\n <br/>\nI just feel like having them read isn&#39;t enough. They must also write,<br/>\nand spell and do those things very well. <br/>\n <br/>\nThese are MY convictions about the English language. I&#39;m not trying to<br/>\noffend anyone. Please excuse my passions as I think through the idea of<br/>\nUSing and language arts.

She&#39;s never had a<br/>\nspelling lesson and doesn&#39;t seem irritated at asking for spellings. To her<br/>\nspelling is a big messy interesting puzzle.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is just saying that lessons weren&#39;t necessary for it to come about.<br/>\nThere are pros and cons to lessons and no lessons, but lessons are not<br/>\nnecessary. For me at least two of the pros are her realizing she&#39;s puzzled<br/>\nout the intricacies of the English language without being taught, the<br/>\nfreedom to do other things during what would have been lesson time. The cons<br/>\nare getting spelling later than some other kids. (But not all kids. Some<br/>\npeople never do learn to spell even with &quot;expert&quot; instruction.)
