And when there is no stigma for not being able<br/>\nto read, kids will learn it when *they&#39;re* ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery few kids are reading at 5. In school they might be recognizing words or<br/>\nthe alphabet, but that&#39;s not reading. It isn&#39;t even really a stepping stone<br/>\nto reading if it&#39;s forced on them. It&#39;s just a way for schools to be able to<br/>\ncheck off that they were taught certain skills, whether those skills are<br/>\nmeaningful to them or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":108678765,"authorName":"sharonashleigh@webtv.net","from":"sharonashleigh@...","profile":"sharonashleigh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Newbie with question too","postDate":"1020773337","msgId":36809,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM1ODgtM0NEN0MzRDktMzkxN0BzdG9yZWZ1bGwtMjM1Ny5wdWJsaWMubGF3c29uLndlYnR2Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"U2FuZHJhRG9kZEBhb2wuY29tJ3MgbWVzc2FnZSBvZiBTdW4sIDUgTWF5IDIwMDIgMTE6Mzg6MzkgRURU"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":36812,"prevInTime":36808,"nextInTime":36810,"topicId":36809,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello!!

All of this talk about 4 and 5 yo kids reading and such is<br/>\nmaking me wonder...  my oldest is a 5yo ds and has little interest in<br/>\nwriting.  He will on occasion but is more interested in building and<br/>\nsort of inventing.  He also does not read on his own yet.  Even as a<br/>\ntoddler  never liked the typical memorizing of the alphabet, etc -- just<br/>\nseemed too busy for it.  He likes being read to and has some favorite<br/>\nbooks just about memorized but I am curious if anyone else has had<br/>\nexperiences similar-- especially if your kids are older now??  This is<br/>\nactually part of the reason we are homeschooling--we did not want to<br/>\npush things that he simply isn&#39;t &quot;ready&quot; for yet and be made to feel<br/>\nlike this is an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just curious if anyone has similar stories?<br/>\nThanks--Sharon</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36961,"nextTopicId":36968}}
