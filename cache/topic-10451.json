Just before they were leaving after their playdate the boys stood in <br/>\nthe garden and peed... Zak thought this was wonderful and did the same,  When <br/>\nI suggested he could use the toilet as well, he said &quot;ok I&#39;ll go there <br/>\ntoo&quot;... We alternated between the garden and the toilet for a while.  It took <br/>\na lot to convince him that going in the bathroom was a better idea than the <br/>\ngarden unless we were camping.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith bm&#39;s that was more difficult.  He used a pull up for the longest time <br/>\nand we went along with it.  Then we tried to take them away and he would hold <br/>\nand then go everywhere.  This was all still going on 6 months ago... Then I <br/>\njust decided to give up as they are his bowls and it&#39;s something in his <br/>\nlittle life he has control over.  So we stopped bothering him.  We told him <br/>\nwe were not buying anymore pull ups when that pack ran out and he&#39;d have to <br/>\nfigure out what to do all by himself.  There were a couple of accidents where <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t make it to the toilet, but within a few days he was going on his <br/>\nown and was dry at night as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will definately not make a big deal out of it for Max...
