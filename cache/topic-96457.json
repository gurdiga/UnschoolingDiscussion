After that, she felt free to <br/>\ndo whatever she wanted with it - including give it away.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other sister gave me a big ceramic plate with a dip dish in the <br/>\nmiddle. Okay - my daughter is the ceramics QUEEN - she makes hundreds <br/>\nof cups and plates and bowls every month or so. And I make them too. We <br/>\nare overrun with ceramics - we give them away all the time. So what was <br/>\nshe thinking? Maybe that we really like ceramics? &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I used it once when she was at my house - put it out on the patio <br/>\ntable with veggies and dip. Planned to give it away the next day, per <br/>\nmy other sister&#39;s rule. But as the giver sister helped me clean up, I <br/>\naccidentally dropped it on the cement patio. Oh dear.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally. It WAS an accident.

It&#39;s kind of an ingrained response for me to react that way as<br/>\nwell - to *not* tell someone what to get me.  What if they already had<br/>\nsomething special in mind?  By the same token, it seems so logical to let<br/>\npeople know what the kids are interested in and what they would appreciate.<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to decide.  What I have done in recent past is call my MIL and let<br/>\nher know what everyone needs and wants hypothetically for Great Grandma and<br/>\nAunt Bonnie if they ask, but then she also hears it and hopefully takes it<br/>\ninto account.  Didn&#39;t really work so far...  Last time, The stuff that made<br/>\nit upstairs after the party within a month is what stuck.  The rest of it I<br/>\nasked Harriet if we could give it to some kids that needed toys and she said<br/>\nthat was fine.  Voila!  People also seem to bring gifts even when you tell<br/>\nthem it isn&#39;t necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 12      <br/>\n&gt;  Date: Sun, 18 Jul 2004 08:21:41 -0700<br/>\n&gt;  From: pam sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Intro/Gift Questions<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Jul 17, 2004, at 5:07 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rubyprincesstsg@...\">rubyprincesstsg@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; If you send out invitations you might make a note that asks them to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; pick  out<br/>\n&gt;&gt; one special gift carefully and if they would like, you are also asking<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; anything over one gift be brought so your child can take and donate it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; homeless or battered women&#39;s shelter or a child in a group home or<br/>\n&gt;&gt; something of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  the sort.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tying this into the post I sent about being resistant to feeling<br/>\n&gt; ordered around - we&#39;d not be going to a party if I got an invitation<br/>\n&gt; like that in the mail - telling me to &quot;pick out one special gift<br/>\n&gt; carefully.&quot; That gave me the exact feeling I was talking about in the<br/>\n&gt; other post - of being told to do something I&#39;m already doing or<br/>\n&gt; planning to do or know I should do.
