And I<br/>\nwould have told him so. And like Sandra, I would ask him if he quizzes all<br/>\nof his patients that way. A lot of people feel the need to find out how much<br/>\nhomeschooled kids don&#39;t know. And if the kids don&#39;t know what those people<br/>\nthink they should, it is because homeschooling is bad. Whenever I encounter<br/>\npeople like that, I ask them why there are so many public schooled kids who<br/>\ndon&#39;t know those things as well; and I ask them why my kids know a lot of<br/>\nthings that ps kids don&#39;t know, and probably aren&#39;t even taught.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the doctor, though. Every health care provider that my kids have had<br/>\nsince we started homeschooling have been impressed that we homeschool. Not<br/>\none ever quized them, or question the wisdom of it. In fact, quite the<br/>\noposite. Most of them have said that they don&#39;t blame us for pulling our<br/>\nkids out of ps. My husband is military, so we have seen quite a few<br/>\ndifferent providers. Even our civilian providers: dentist, allergist, eye<br/>\ndoctor, as well as their nurses and office staff, think that homeschooling<br/>\nis great. Perhaps it is because the school district in this town is so<br/>\nawful, I don&#39;t know. The provider that my middle son had when we first took<br/>\nour kids out of ps, told us that he considered doing the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had been reported to child protective services for educational neglect<br/>\nbecause we kept our son home when he had asthma attacks. Our son&#39;s health<br/>\ncare providers were furious about this. They wrote letters on our behalf,<br/>\nbut to no avail. We were still found guilty because we didn&#39;t have a<br/>\ndoctor&#39;s note to cover each and every day that he was absent. The school<br/>\nnurse was only at the school 2 half days a week, and she wasn&#39;t trained in<br/>\nhow to care for asthmatics. First we just switched our two youngest to a<br/>\ndifferent elementary school, with the plan of preparing to homeschool the<br/>\nfollowing year. Well, one day at the new school I called the school to let<br/>\nthem know my youngest wouldn&#39;t be there because he had a fever of  103, and<br/>\nthe principal said that it was probably just allergies and that I should<br/>\nsend him anyways. Well that was it! I went downtown that same day and filed<br/>\nthe paperwork to establish a homeschool! The principal was so shocked on the<br/>\nfollowing Monday when I showed up and told her that that would be my son&#39;s<br/>\nfinal day at school. The only people around here that we ever get any flack<br/>\nfrom about homeschool are a few teachers and a busybody old lady at church<br/>\nwho is always bossing everybody around. Most of the teachers that I know<br/>\npersonally think it is great that we homeschool. One of them even told me<br/>\nthat if she wasn&#39;t at the school everyday to keep an eye on what goes on<br/>\nwith her daughters, and to be able to hand pick her teachers, that she would<br/>\nbe homeschooling her own daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, as my oldest ds would say, I have blabbered on enough!<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzanna in Clovis, NM</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36704,"nextTopicId":36720}}
