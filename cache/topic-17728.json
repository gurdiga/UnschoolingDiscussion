I<br/>\nalways have the opposite going on.<br/>\nAfter relatives (usually with children) leave I feel so happy my children are who<br/>\nthey are....<br/>\nIt is hard to answer the questions about why my son, who is 8 isn&#39;t reading much<br/>\nyet.  I am always happy to see them go so I can look at my children from my own<br/>\neyes, and I know they are wonderful human beings...which is my goal!<br/>\nAnn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks Ann. My daughter&#39;s birthday is next weekend. My parents and my in-laws<br/>\n&gt; will come. I love them all, but ... what is that feeling I&#39;m trying to<br/>\n&gt; describe ... I feel pulled back into a &quot;good little girl&quot; role when they are<br/>\n&gt; here. Seeking approval. &quot;Look, look at how great my kids are, gang! Aren&#39;t I<br/>\n&gt; DOING A GREAT JOB?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yuck. They leave and I&#39;m disgusted with myself. Sooo ... this time I am<br/>\n&gt; trying HARDER to remind myself to let my life speak for itself. What is that<br/>\n&gt; quote I can&#39;t call to mind right now? Something about not being able to hear<br/>\n&gt; your words because your personality is speaking too loudly? Is it Twain? Help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry for the ramble.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Laura<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
