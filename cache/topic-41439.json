I did a <br/>\ntremendous amount of reading about it back then (at first it was an ethical <br/>\nchoice but later, after doing a lot of reading, I realized that it was a <br/>\nbig-time health issue also).  I took a lot of grief from my family back <br/>\nthen; they did not support me in my efforts and ribbed (no pun!) me quite a <br/>\nbit.  But, I stuck to my guns (as your amazing daughter is doing), and I <br/>\nnever took another bite of meat.  It&#39;s been 30 years!  Now, my mother and <br/>\nsister are adopting a vegetarian lifestyle to deal with serious health <br/>\nissues they face.  I&#39;m honored and grateful to be able to be their &quot;coach.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou and your daughter can learn quite a bit about ethical vegetarianism, <br/>\nbut I would strongly recommend that you filter the information through you <br/>\nrather than allowing her to discover this with you; there are some horrific <br/>\nthings that are done to animals in the farm industry.
