I <br/>\ncan&#39;t see either of my children ever writing operas, etc.  But my son is very <br/>\ngood at playing in the sandbox and building forts with the couch cushions!  <br/>\nIt really was an inspiration though of how it could be.  Thanks for everyone <br/>\nwho recommended it.  My next book to tackle is Valerie Fitzenreiter...maybe I <br/>\ncan find time over the holidays!<br/>\nAmanda B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":86409,"nextTopicId":86362}}
