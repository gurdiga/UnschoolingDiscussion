It&#39;s where I had all my <br/>\nnotions challenged and I&#39;m still making gradual changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a few principles I&#39;ve gleaned.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. We are the parents and we have the power. That means that <br/>\nwe have a bigger responsiblity to be aware of how powerless it <br/>\nmust feel to be a child in the home of a parent. If I&#39;m an alcoholic, <br/>\nmy kids partake. If my husband gets a new job, my kids have to <br/>\nmove and make new friends. If we buy a house with a huge yard, <br/>\nthere is a ton of grass to mow. Since the choices we make <br/>\ndirectly affect the lives and well-being of our children, I&#39;ve come to <br/>\nbelieve that it is our primary responsiblity to make sure that our <br/>\nchildren have as many choices as possible within the already <br/>\ngivens they must live with until they are on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. That means that if I talk my husband into a big house and <br/>\nyard, he and I ought to be the ones who primarily take care of <br/>\nit--paint it, mow the lawn, clean it up, maintain it. We now are <br/>\nmaking decisions with that in mind. Do I want to buy this kind of <br/>\nfurniture if it means that I have to supervise and guard it, making <br/>\nthe kids miserable?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Asking for help is fine. We are learning that it&#39;s wonderful to <br/>\nhelp each other out. I used to think that I had a right to my <br/>\nchildren&#39;s help and I spent far too much time resenting either <br/>\ntheir half-done jobs, their procrastination or their bad attitudes <br/>\nwhen doing the work. Once I flipped my perspective, I saw that it <br/>\nwas a gift from my kids to me that they would wash the dishes or <br/>\nmow the lawn. Those things didn&#39;t mean as much to them. And <br/>\nyet they were willing to do them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I changed my phrasing and now say: &quot;Can anyone help me <br/>\nget this kitchen cleaned up?&quot; If they say no, I do as much as I <br/>\ncan. But now, during the last six month, my kids are just helping <br/>\nall the time and I can&#39;t believe it. <br/>\n<br/>\nA few weeks ago, I had had a full day of schlepping kids to <br/>\nsports and an evening homeschool program. I came home to a <br/>\nhuge amount of dishes. I heaved a sigh. I knew I had to do them. <br/>\nOut of the blue while clicking away on the X box, my 15 year old <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Hey Mom. Let me do those. Youget to bed. I can just do <br/>\nthem and listen to my music. I&#39;m not tired.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT is how it is now so often. What a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I offer to help often. When anyone is struggling with what they <br/>\nneed to do or get done, I pitch in right away.<br/>\n<br/>\nHth, Kris.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10110095,"authorName":"Mattydill@aol.com","from":"Mattydill@...","profile":"momofpickle2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:[Unschooling]Rewording(wasChildren&#39;s participation in family responsibilities","postDate":"1054905813","msgId":72548,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5OS4xYjUzOGMxZS4yYzExZWZkNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":72695,"prevInTime":72547,"nextInTime":72549,"topicId":72548,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/6/03 8:45:40 AM Eastern Daylight Time, Mattydill@aol.com ...
