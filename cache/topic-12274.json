Eventually he came to see that it really didn&#39;t matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh also learned another valuable lesson from my daugthter. Always save room <br/>\nfor dessert. He was raised to clean his plate to get dessert, so he was in <br/>\nthe habit of basically filling himself and then stuffing in dessert.

Now<br/>\nI could use some help myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I&#39;m really a good mom.  Yesterday drove me to the brink of &quot;send hem<br/>\nto school quick!   I thought we were having a great day, dd making Barbie<br/>\nclothes from felt & staples (interesting look), painting, reading books,<br/>\netc.  The kids were having fun.  My ds (4) was participating with great<br/>\nenthusiasm.  He did have a few spats late afternoon with ds (2) over toys<br/>\nwhich I thought they&#39;d settled very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen like a switch he was playing with his brother his brother (2) in their<br/>\nbedroom.  DS (2) came out to me after awhile & said bo bo & pulled me into<br/>\ntheir room.  DS (4) was under the crib & after some time I was able to get<br/>\nhim out.  His first comment was &quot;do you forgive me?&quot; so he knew he&#39;d done<br/>\nsomething wrong.  I sent him back thinking he&#39;d pulled an arm off one of the<br/>\nBarbies only to have him present me with a tape, or at least its remains.<br/>\nHe&#39;d pulled it out, stretched & had knotted the rest into a mess.  No real<br/>\nproblem I thought he&#39;ll just loose one of his tapes.  WRONG, it was a<br/>\nlibrary tape dd had checked out.  The more I saw the madder I got.  All I<br/>\ncould hear from ds was &quot;I won&#39;t do it again.&quot;  He got a spanking in spite of<br/>\nhis promise, as he makes them too readily & doesn&#39;t remember them the next<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took the tape into the living room to see if I could recover the mess back<br/>\ninto the tape box when I noticed he&#39;d snapped the tape.  I put it on the<br/>\ntable to show dh later & left the room.  I was mad about the tape & knew it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t the time to confront him any further.  I gave him time out.  After he<br/>\nwas up from time out I thought he was playing well with the other two.<br/>\nWRONG dd came in & said &quot;you have to come see what Gegory did.&quot;  I go in &<br/>\nfind he&#39;s again pulled the tape out & now has it all over the living room.<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t believe it.  He got another timeout.  I didn&#39;t trust myself to<br/>\nspank.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids have a tape player in their room (have since birth) & the tapes sit<br/>\nnext to it on a chest of drawers.  We&#39;ve never had a problem from any of the<br/>\nkids doing this.  When dh had been home for a bit I showed him the problem<br/>\ntape.  He talked with the ds.  By this time I got a call to pickup dd (16) &<br/>\nI jumped at the chance to leave the house to cool off.  When I returned I<br/>\nsaw my sweet sweet son standing in the kitchen smiling up at me with a huge<br/>\nchunk of his hair missing right in the middle.  Not just cut short but cut<br/>\nat down to the scalp about the size of a half dollar.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I know that years from now we&#39;ll remember this day & laugh.  But that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help me now.  Am I just over reacting or how do I get a handle on<br/>\nthis before it gets any worse.  I know he&#39;s interested in how things work,<br/>\nright now he&#39;s checking out a staple remover & picking up colored pencils.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really strange, he is really such a sweet child most of the time but<br/>\nthere are times (weeks in between thank goodness), without warning that a<br/>\nswitch flips & he&#39;s a nightmare.  Most of these times he&#39;ll start screaming<br/>\n& you can&#39;t communicate with him at all.  Then the experience ends without<br/>\nany causal connection & it&#39;s like it never happened.  His doctor says he&#39;s<br/>\nhealthy, he was 2 months premature, in the ICU for 4 wks for lung<br/>\ndevelopment.  When he was 1-2 he&#39;d pitch a tantrum throughing himself to the<br/>\nfloor hitting his head on the floor.  But these disappeared before he was<br/>\n2.5.

I&#39;m at my wits end.  I dread dinnertimes <br/>\n&gt;  now...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The throwing up part has me concerned.  It may be there is a food allergy or <br/>\nsome other medical condition.  I had a friend who&#39;s child did nearly waste <br/>\naway.  It took 2 years of diligence and a lot of luck before the diagnosis <br/>\nwas finally made.  She came very close to dying.  Once the family knew the <br/>\nproblem, the solution was very easy...she simply had to avoid foods that <br/>\ncontained or caused gluten because the gluten was gumming up her intestines.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there isn&#39;t a medical condition, I would guess this is an issue that your <br/>\nds feels strongly enough about that there will be no winning with any methods <br/>\nof force feeding or coercion.  (Been there done that...only I was the child!  <br/>\nI still have some major food aversions due to being force fed as a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a very picky eater who also ate very small portions.  It was very hard <br/>\nto not make food an issue.  Talk about gut wrenching...for all the reasons <br/>\nyou described.  Ultimately, we decided to follow the expert&#39;s advice of the <br/>\ntime (something I don&#39;t do often...LOL) and quit worrying about it.  DS was <br/>\nasked to sit with us for dinner and visit if he didn&#39;t feel like eating.  I <br/>\nmade a point of including something that was normally tempting to him in <br/>\nevery meal, but not necessarily the entire meal.  I figured that way there <br/>\nwould be something there for him to eat if he wanted it.  We serve ourselves <br/>\nbecause I&#39;ve seen lots of reports that a parent&#39;s idea of normal portion and <br/>\nthe size of a child&#39;s stomach are often far apart.  So, ds was required to <br/>\nsit and be polite while we ate.  If he didn&#39;t like/want what was on the <br/>\ntable, he could get his own of something else.  It is hard enough for me to <br/>\nmake one dinner, I don&#39;t do duplicates.  I kept easy things in the <br/>\ncupboards/fridge and supervised his efforts when he prepared something <br/>\n(typically PB&J).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe did get quite skinny, but had lots of energy and at every doctor&#39;s appt. <br/>\nthe doc was confident he was developing normally so was not concerned about <br/>\nhis weight.  As an infant he was in 90th percentile height/weight ratio.  At <br/>\nage 6 it was 10th.  I actually had people stopping us in the grocery store <br/>\nand asking if I had considered taking him to a doctor to have him checked.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly, about age 9, he put on weight and quickly.  He stopped gaining, but <br/>\nstill hasn&#39;t grown into all his weight.  He&#39;ll be 12 in October.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother note, we&#39;ve come to discover that ds does have a physical problem <br/>\nwhich gets in the way of eating on our schedule.  He has an illness which has <br/>\nlots of queasy tummy symptoms.  It&#39;s pretty hard to want to eat when your <br/>\nstomach is upset.  I was already glad we&#39;d avoided power struggles over food, <br/>\nbut doubly so when this came to light!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, relax.  Assuming he is learning and developing normally, is not lethargic <br/>\nor other health concerns, it is probably a phase which he will eventually <br/>\noutgrow.  One day he&#39;ll be a teenager and you won&#39;t be able to keep enough <br/>\nfood in the house to satisfy him!  I would still have him come to the table <br/>\nand visit with the rest of the family at meal times, eating or not as he <br/>\nneeds.  As for what alternative foods to offer, it is really up to you.  I&#39;m <br/>\ninclined to allow cold cereal, but the expense gets rather high.  DH thinks <br/>\ncereal is for breakfast ONLY and so there have had to be comprises.  For <br/>\ninstance, cereal is one of the options, but we don&#39;t buy lots of sweetened <br/>\nstuff.  Cheese sticks or slices, carrot/celery sticks, apples and other <br/>\nfruits, yogurt, crackers (graham, saltine, whole wheat...there&#39;s lots of <br/>\nvariety), PB&J sandwiches, eggs already boiled and ready in the fridge, <br/>\ngranola bars.  Just a sample list to get your juices going.  Help him get <br/>\nlots of liquids.  It&#39;s easy for little people to get dehydrated, which can <br/>\ncause mixed hunger/lack of hunger signals.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS lived on ramen for a while and mac and cheese quickly became a favorite <br/>\nwhen he could fix it with supervision.  PB&J is still a staple.  Hard boiled <br/>\neggs are a hit in spurts (take a pencil and put and X or the date on them so <br/>\nyou know which are hard boiled!)  He still likes cold cereal for a bedtime <br/>\nsnack...but then so does his mom!<br/>\n<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Corallyn","from":"&quot;Corallyn &quot; &lt;hape2day@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"H7ZH_6TV1wtWBtv3nO0fQdzizJlD0AkPIuIOItN6Nu11muu5dVpzRiTplcZ09Rfvl9Kwjm3x0ZAilXXufxmJrpjuSfsO85M","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Food Issues","postDate":"967612284","msgId":12288,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhvaTUxcythaDBjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEYyOTNVWGVRWnA4MDgzVkJ3V0YwMDAwMmNjY0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12287,"nextInTopic":12289,"prevInTime":12287,"nextInTime":12289,"topicId":12274,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Something else I do is to let them be part of the decission making on what we have for dinner.

I want our meals to be <br/>\npeaceful times and I want to enjoy each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what we do now.  We have little junk in the house and we almost never <br/>\nhave desert.  I make a normal meal and people choose what they want to eat <br/>\nfrom that.  I always have some type of protein, a vegetable and a grain or <br/>\nbread.  If my kids don&#39;t like it they are welcome to go and make themselves a <br/>\npeanut butter sandwich or cereal or eat some fruit I do not prepare a second <br/>\nmeal.  I may leave sauces off of something and serve it on the side.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always have a good selection of fruit on hand, whole grain breads and real <br/>\ncheese/yogurt and when they were smaller I kept a snack plate in the fridge <br/>\nwith cheese and cut up veggies and they were allowed to eat it whenever they <br/>\nwanted.  They do get sweets but not on a regular basis and never as a reward <br/>\nfor eating something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard to disengage but we have no battles at the table anymore.  I truly <br/>\nthink some individuals are just not that interested in food.  My son is one <br/>\nand he has always had a problem with textures and strong tastes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI make sure they have a vitamin every day and they both drink lots of <br/>\nfiltered water.  They are lean, rarely sick and have incredible energy.  Do I <br/>\nwish my son liked more foods? You bet.  But I can&#39;t dread each meal.

I let him decide <br/>\nif he was going to eat or not. If he chose not to that was fine but <br/>\nif he was hungery later guess what he got for bed time. That&#39;s right. <br/>\nHis dinner. If he chose to go to bed hungery that was his choice not <br/>\nmine. I guarenty you he ate a good breakfast the next morning though. <br/>\nI just made sure to have lots of good snacks in the house and little <br/>\njunk. If he chose to eat his dinner or any other meal then he got a <br/>\ntreat for snack. If he chose not to eat the meal then he got his left <br/>\nover meal for snack. There was no barganing bartering or anything <br/>\nelse of the sort. He was in total control of when and if he ate and <br/>\nsomewhat in control of what he ate, by choosing to eat he got the <br/>\ntreat. I didn&#39;t make a big deal about it. I just did it. If he <br/>\ncomplained that he wanted a treat and had not eaten his meal then I <br/>\nwould explain to him that he had to eat his meal first  and then he <br/>\ncould have a treat. I have to tell you also that my son has always <br/>\nbeen lean. At 6mo he had a washboard stomach...never had any baby <br/>\nfat. He is still lean and healthy and all of his 40lb is muscle. If <br/>\nyou make a big deal about it, it will turn into a control issue. DH <br/>\nwould do this when he was  home to have dinner with us by not <br/>\nallowing DS to leave the table until DS had eaten to DH&#39;s content. <br/>\nThe next day he would eat less. Just relax and let DS make his own <br/>\nchoices and then be responsible for those choices.

HELP HELP HELP.....<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F<br/>\nTucson, AZ<br/>\n<br/>\nPS the baby 11 months old eats anything and everything....<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Dawn,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 4 kids with 4 different appitites. My 3rd is a 4-1/2 yo girl. She&#39;s a<br/>\nvery picky eater. Hates vegetables of any kind. Hates anything &quot;different&quot;.<br/>\nThrows a fit if we suggest potatoes are not &quot;yucky and stupid&quot;. For awhile I<br/>\nthought she was living on air itself. Never finished a meal. The ironic<br/>\nthing is she&#39;s built like a brick and is the healthiest of all my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince she&#39;s so healthy I don&#39;t cater to her. I prepare what I want for<br/>\neveryone and let her eat what she&#39;ll eat. If she&#39;s still hungry she can help<br/>\nherself to applesauce or cheerios or a piece of bread (those are the 3 main<br/>\nfood groups to her) She gets them herself. I&#39;m not a short-order cook. I<br/>\nwon&#39;t fight about it and it&#39;s taken my husband awhile to realize it&#39;s not<br/>\nworth fighting about. I don&#39;t want them to end up with some weird food<br/>\ncontrol issue. Someday she&#39;ll eat all those yucky things she won&#39;t touch<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t worry about your son starving. As long as you give him healthy<br/>\nchoices he&#39;ll be okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Valerie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NumoAstro@aol.com","from":"NumoAstro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"AZwf-wZbQxjVgraIvX2WqHVnhAJOOO44j22cCrDKOAnSADnSbZlcOAsW9qlJJDbXwg1GDzeMcas","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Food Issues","postDate":"967587663","msgId":12274,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU3LmE5MTRhYTkuMjZkZDkxNGZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12275,"prevInTime":12273,"nextInTime":12275,"topicId":12274,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Help...
