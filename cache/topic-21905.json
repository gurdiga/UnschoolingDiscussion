I worked as a CNA for 4 years and did my training in a nursing <br/>\nhome. I was a bit horrified at the attitude of some of those nurses. When you <br/>\npoint it out to them they get embarressed and sometimes you can get an honest <br/>\nanswer about how over worked they are and that sometimes they just get burnt <br/>\nout. Absolutely no excuse but it does happen alot. I quit that job when I <br/>\nrealized that most of my patients would die. Duh!  I knew that as a fact , <br/>\nbut when it actually happens it gets very depressing when you know you cant <br/>\ndo anything to help them . And no matter how hard you try , you cant make <br/>\nthem comfortable. I never saw abuse , but there is definately a &quot;coolness&quot; <br/>\nabout their dealings with the patient. Also I notice that alot of places will <br/>\ncall the patient a &quot;client&quot; instead of patient ( I personally think this is <br/>\ncold, ) for the reason that they are trained this way so as not to get too <br/>\nattached to the patient. The reason they gave was that if you become involved <br/>\nin a patients life and they pass on then you will become burnt out too <br/>\nquickly. I could go on but we would be here all day.
