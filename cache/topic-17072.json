We checked out the \nchildren&#39;s section. WOW! Naomi wanted some workbooks to work in...her choice. So \nwe picked out 5th grade math and a book called science made easy. She also \npicked up Little women Illustrated classics (my mom had bought her Heidi a \ncouple years ago) and 2 other classics The Wizard of Oz and Peter Pan. She&#39;s \nbeen enjoying her math book and reading the others. </font></div>\n<div><font color=\"#ffff00\" face=\"Pooh\" size=\"4\">Saturday..I went to the library while \nshe went with friends out of town to visit their grandma...and picked up 4 books \nto do with science...a couple of them to use in cooking and edible cooking \nscience projects and the other one was quick science fun you can do in a minute \nor two. The other book was on Mammoths. She read that one last night and enjoyed \nit. </font></div>\n<div><font color=\"#ffff00\" face=\"Pooh\" size=\"4\">ITs still early today, we just got up \na bit ago and haven&#39;t a clue as to what we will do yet today. I do know that I \nneed to go and make some breakfast soon...Both of us are hungry! I hope you all \nhave a wonderful day..</font></div>\n<div><font color=\"#ffff00\" face=\"Pooh\" size=\"4\">Jessica</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#00ff00\">Vaughnde Lee<br></font><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stampinbookworm.eboard.com\">http://www.stampinbookworm.eboard.com</a><br></div>\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-801803357imageholder\"\n style=\"\">\n \n\n\n \n \n\n<p></p></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17059,"nextTopicId":16999}}
