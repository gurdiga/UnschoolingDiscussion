Now I&#39;m in college studying<br/>\nJournalism, and I publish a new, free resource to<br/>\nhelp my fellow home schoolers learn science on the<br/>\ninternet.<br/>\n     Students will love the cartoon kids and<br/>\nwholesome plots while they learn science from<br/>\nthe most basic principles.<br/>\n     This is a learning tool I would have really<br/>\nenjoyed during my home schooling. I think others<br/>\nwill enjoy it, also.<br/>\n     It is completely free. Please visit my site,<br/>\ngive me some feedback, and then tell others<br/>\nabout it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pweb.netcom.com/~moto2/index.htm\">http://pweb.netcom.com/~moto2/index.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n            hear from you soon, Amos</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6747,"nextTopicId":6791}}
