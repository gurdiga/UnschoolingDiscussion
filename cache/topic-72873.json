They *did* fuel the fire a litle bit, but NOT as much <br/>\nas I would have liked, and not as much as some of my friends&#39; parents did <br/>\n(buying farms and moving into the country for example! Or buying a RV to travel to <br/>\nshows every weekend!). But their seeming lack of interest NEVER deterred me <br/>\nfrom what I loved.

No matter <br/>\nhow much I &quot;give&quot; to him in skateboarding, it won&#39;t compare to those kids whose <br/>\ndads are ex-pro&#39;s or whose moms can &quot;buy & build&quot; skateparks.
