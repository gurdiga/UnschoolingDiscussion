Their stories are an integral part of the nation&#39;s history, as is<br/>\n  the inhumane treatment by settlers headed west and the U.S. government.<br/>\n  Several new books for children explore the traditions, ways of life and<br/>\n  legends of these tribes. <br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Navajo Long Walk: The Tragic Story of a Proud People&#39;s Forced March From<br/>\n  Their Homeland,&quot; by Joseph Bruchac (National Geographic Books, $18.95),<br/>\n  explains how the government forced the Navajo in the 1860s from their land,<br/>\n  Dinetah, in northern Arizona to an isolated reservation. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Author Bruchac recalls the history of the Navajo people and tells what led to<br/>\n  Kit Carson&#39;s Army raid of the canyon, which destroyed homes, crops and the<br/>\n  harmony that is the guiding force of the Navajo people. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Shonto Begay, a Navajo, created striking illustrations for the book that<br/>\n  reveal the hardships of his people during this little-known time. In 1863,<br/>\n  1864 and 1866, groups of Navajo, numbering in the thousands, were forced by<br/>\n  Army troops to walk 470 miles from Fort Defiance in eastern Arizona to Fort<br/>\n  Sumner west of Albuquerque, N.M. Those too sick or weak to keep up were left<br/>\n  behind to die. Once at Fort Sumner, food was scarce and other bands of Indians<br/>\n  raided their livestock. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Following the Civil War, public opposition to the terrible conditions at the<br/>\n  Navajo reservation forced the government to allow the people to return to<br/>\n  their homeland, Bruchac explains. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Two traditional tales of the Lakota people are recounted by Paul Goble in &quot;The<br/>\n  Return of the Buffaloes&quot; and &quot;The Legend of the White Buffalo Woman&quot; (National<br/>\n  Geographic, $7.95 each). <br/>\n<br/>\n  In &quot;The Return,&quot; Goble explains that for the nomadic peoples of the High<br/>\n  Plains, &quot;the buffalo was a gift from the Great Spirit, and supplied almost<br/>\n  everything material which they needed.&quot; When the herds wandered far away,<br/>\n  famine resulted. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Goble has adapted the Lakota myth of the mysterious woman who brings back the<br/>\n  buffalo. &quot;She is one of the Buffalo People sent . . . to tell humankind of<br/>\n  their great love and the gift of themselves so that people can live.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;The Blue Roses&quot; by Linda Boyden, a Cherokee, is a contemporary native<br/>\n  American story about the special relationship between a young girl, Rosalie,<br/>\n  and her grandfather, who plants a rosebush the day she is born. As she grows,<br/>\n  he teaches her about gardening and comforts her when seeds she sows die.<br/>\n  &quot;Everything has its time to die. New or old, it doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Rosalie&#39;s<br/>\n  grandfather explains. <br/>\n<br/>\n  When the old man dies, Rosalie dreams of a garden with a trellis of beautiful<br/>\n  blue roses, a vision that shows her how to keep her grandfather in her heart<br/>\n  forever. The book is beautifully illustrated by Amy Cordova, with the Indian<br/>\n  characters and settings in bold primary colors (Lee and Low Books, $16.95). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ============================= <br/>\n  Support the American Indian Movement Support Group of Ohio and Northern<br/>\n  Kentucky <br/>\n  Go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aim_support.tripod.com/\">http://aim_support.tripod.com/</a> and find out how to order AIM Supporter<br/>\n  stickers! <br/>\n  ----------------------------- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  =============================<br/>\n  Support the American Indian Movement Support Group of Ohio and Northern Kentucky<br/>\n  Go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aim_support.tripod.com/\">http://aim_support.tripod.com/</a> and find out how to order AIM Supporter stickers!<br/>\n  -----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thank you for your interest in Indian issues!
