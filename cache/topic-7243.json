I \nwant him to be happy in his learning environment.&nbsp; He sais,&quot; Am I ever \ngonna go to a regular school?, and play with the toys?&quot; (when he was around 3 we \nwent and viewed some schools, to get an idea of what was available besides \npublic school, and I think he may be referrring to one of the schools we went to \nsee)_I said this is a regular school, and you have plenty of toys(my son is \n4)&nbsp; He spouts off&quot; This ain&#39;t NO school, This is a home!!!!&quot;&nbsp; This was \nvery frustrating to me, as I feel he is expressing the need for more stimulating \nactivites.&nbsp; I don&#39;t really know how to go about planning more activites. \nHas anyone else had something like this occur. My question also being, having \nNever been taught in an institutional environment, I wonder why he would ASSUME \nhe would enjoy this environment more than homeschool.&nbsp; ANd why would he \ncategorize homeschool , Not as school, where does this , sounding-programmed \nattitide come from?&nbsp; It really makes my confidence in homeschooling, \nsuffer.&nbsp; I wish I had a homeschooling group, so that he could see other \nchildren who are also learning like this, as all his friends, and aquaintences \nare in public or private schools.&nbsp; SO this is probably where he gets \nit.&nbsp; Any advice here?&nbsp; I want to start a playgroup , does anyone have \nany suggestions about getting one up off it&#39;s feet?&nbsp;There are many reasons \nI chose to homeschool him, and they are all very important to me, but when he \nmakes a statement such as this I wonder if I am giving him what he needs. \nThanks.&nbsp; Michelle</font></div></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7235,"nextTopicId":7244}}
