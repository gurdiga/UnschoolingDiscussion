A couple of months ago, we <br/>\nhad some witnesses knock on the door just as Kass, Kree and I were brushing our <br/>\nteeth. We were getting ready to head out and my garage was open, since we had <br/>\njust packed the car for a park day. I answered the door with toothbrush in <br/>\nmouth thinking it was a neighbor. Wrong, it was someone arriving to &quot;save&quot; my <br/>\nheathen soul. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nThe twins came to the door to see who I could be yapping with, especially <br/>\nabout God, the bible and Christ. They said, &quot;mom we have to go...&quot; they thought <br/>\nthey were rescuing me. Then I turned around and gave them the grin. They both <br/>\nlooked at each other and sighed heavily. Kass looked at Kree and said, &quot;Oh man <br/>\nthis dude should have never knocked on our door, mom&#39;s gonna debate him.&quot; All <br/>\nthis in front of the &quot;witness&quot;. He said, &quot;Oh you have children, do you <br/>\nhomeschool them?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No, we don&#39;t do school at all.&quot; He just stood there staring at me. Then he <br/>\nwent into his spiel about did I know God - the Jehovah, to which I replied, <br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve heard of him, but  he awfully angry at his children, so I pray to both God <br/>\nand Goddess, because they are loving creators who hope I learn my lessons this <br/>\ntime around, either way though, they aren&#39;t gonna be pissed at me and banish <br/>\nme away for all eternity.&quot; ROFLMAO<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought he was gonna faint then and there. So we debated my statement for a <br/>\nfew minutes and by this time he thought if he pulled out his bible he could <br/>\none up me.  So I had the girls retreive a couple of bibles from my personal <br/>\nlibrary, to which he was astonished I could produce. I laughed and said, &quot;I&#39;m a <br/>\nwell read heathen. Have you ever read the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying?&quot; He <br/>\nwas a black man turning white before my eyes. He went on about idol worship <br/>\nand I went back to, &quot;Why is your God so egotisical?&quot; By this time the twins <br/>\nwere just shaking their heads and once more said, &quot;Mom, we&#39;re gonna be late.&quot; <br/>\nThis time the man was thankful, for it was his exit clue and he was more than <br/>\nwilling to take it this time. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe left saying he was sure I was a good mom but that he would pray for my <br/>\nsoul. I told him, &quot;Don&#39;t waste your time, pray for someone who really needs it! <br/>\nHave a nice day.&quot; I closed the door and the three of us laughed til we cried, <br/>\nthen went to parkday.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen on Easter morning, I opened my garage to pack my car and found a couple, <br/>\nstanding at my driveway, praying. I just stood there til they opened their <br/>\neyes and then I started laughing. They asked if I was &quot;saved&quot;. To which I <br/>\nlaughed harder. I said politely though, &quot;No thank you, but could you move off my <br/>\ndriveway, cuz my heathen hubby will run you over, Easter or not.&quot; Jaws dropped <br/>\nand they moved swiftly. My hubby walked out and I was still laughing. He asked <br/>\nwhat was so funny and I pointed to the neighbors driveway. He walked out of the <br/>\ngarage and looked and down my street, stood about 6 couples at various <br/>\ndriveways. His jaw dropped and he asked, &quot;You are gonna sage before we leave right?&quot; <br/>\nHe meant smudge, but the fact he even remembered sage was enough for me to <br/>\ngrin. I said, &quot;No need honey, they meant no harm.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I tell these stories not to belittle whatever anyone&#39;s faith may be, <br/>\nbut that when you come knockin on our door, the dialogue goes both ways. Most <br/>\noften, we&#39;re more then they bargained for.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda - who can&#39;t think of a good sig line, cuz she&#39;s still laughing about <br/>\nstories above.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74100,"nextTopicId":74124}}
