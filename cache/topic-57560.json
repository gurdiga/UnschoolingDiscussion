Bailey and Rebecca<br/>\nAnne Bailey.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if it was here or another list that I read a<br/>\nrecommendation for this book, but wherever, I really like it. I think<br/>\nit has a terrible title and cover photo but if you get past those it<br/>\nhas some great ideas. What makes it different from so many parenting<br/>\nbooks is that it focuses on the parent - how do you act, how do you do<br/>\nwith self-discipline, etc. - how you can change so you can have a<br/>\nbetter relationship with your kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nDonna Andrea in Nova Scotia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57524,"nextTopicId":57308}}
