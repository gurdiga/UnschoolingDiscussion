And I love that you were there.  When we  <br/>\nsaw it on TV I thought &quot;Diana will get to see that!&quot; but it hadn&#39;t  <br/>\noccurred to me you might&#39;ve been there when it happened.  What a  <br/>\nGREAT story for your kids to be able to tell in thirty or forty  <br/>\nyears.  (Now too, but there&#39;s a specialness to being able to tell eye  <br/>\nwitness stories to those who weren&#39;t born then.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Holly reminded me of two stories.  She said once, just  <br/>\ntrying to make me feel old to be funny, she said &quot;What color was your  <br/>\nhorse when you were little?&quot;  And I said &quot;grey,&quot; and tried to explain  <br/>\ndappled to her.   And she said our friend Brett once asked his mom  <br/>\n(for the same sarcastic kind of purpose) what it was like when  <br/>\nTylenol was invented, and she told him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own memories of my home town seem interesting now that time has  <br/>\npassed.  There was only one bridge over the Rio Grande when I was  <br/>\ngrowing up, so when there were parades the whole town was closed down  <br/>\nand all through traffic was halted for a long time.  Now there are  <br/>\nthree bridges.  But when I was younger I knew a guy had been a kid  <br/>\nsitting in the back of a wagon and the last wagon over before the  <br/>\nonly bridge in town was washed away by a flood.  He was stick on the  <br/>\nwrong side of the river from his mom for two days.  (He was with his  <br/>\nuncle and cousins.)   The one bridge I knew was the replacement for  <br/>\nthe bridge he had seen wash away in the 1930&#39;s.  I don&#39;t remember his  <br/>\nname, but he was a substitute teacher who used to tell great stories  <br/>\nif the teacher hadn&#39;t left a lesson, and sometimes even if they had. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEye witness stuff is so cool.  Holly asked me the other day if I knew  <br/>\nanyone who had been at Woodstock, and I said &quot;No, but Ric was...&quot; and  <br/>\nshe interrupted and finished it enthusiastically:  &quot;Ric saw the  <br/>\nBeatles at Shea Stadium.&quot;   Right.  So sometimes it&#39;s even worth  <br/>\nreciting who we know who was eye-witness to what.  So Holly can say  <br/>\nforever &quot;Hannah and Hayden were there when that big grain tower in  <br/>\nNorth Dakota failed to collapse.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Dec 6, 2005, at 10:15 AM, diana jenner wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; On Saturday our family, and thousands of others, gathered downtown to<br/>\n&gt; watch the demolition of our city&#39;s tallest building.
