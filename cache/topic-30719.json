They have alarm clocks and this practice is not so early they should have trouble getting up so I am going to try the approach that if they need me to get them up, maybe they also need me to tell them when to go to bed.

My girls got up this morning about 1/2 hour before we were to leave and then just sat around as if there was nothing to do.  I asked what time they wanted to leave for basketball and said fine if they were ready, I would drive them, otherwise they would have to ride their bikes.  One minute before it was time to leave, I told them I would be out in the car.  My 12 yo followed and I started the car and pulled out the drive way.  When I got to the bottom of the driveway, my 10 yo came running out of the house and hopped in the car.  I was hoping I would not have to drive away without her but if she tested me I would have to.  The 12 yo did not eat any breakfast and now that it is 11:45, she is complaining of a headache and is in a terrible mood.  Oh well, I guess I can put up with it if she learns something from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Kolleen <br/>\nTo: Unschooling.com <br/>\nSent: Saturday, January 05, 2002 9:47 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Question about consequences<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I know I ultimately have no control over whether they decide that being on <br/>\n&gt;time and being responsible with their commitments are not important but I <br/>\n&gt;feel I should do my best as their parent to help them with this.
