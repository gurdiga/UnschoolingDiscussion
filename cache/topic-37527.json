My mother at first was <br/>\ntotally against it, and now is resigned to it but delights in giving <br/>\nme little underhand digs whenever possible ... for example, her <br/>\nlatest letter contained a sentence stating &quot; So, I suppose now that <br/>\nsummer is coming, you&#39;ll teach them Something(underlined) during this <br/>\ntime...&quot;  This was tucked in between &quot;Say Hi to everyone&quot; and &quot;The <br/>\nweather has been cold lately&quot;.

The only thing he was right about, is <br/>\ndespite what he feels about homeschooling, my daughter will learn anyway <br/>\nsomehow. So, saturday his daughter was here. She didn&#39;t realize that Megan <br/>\nwas homeschooling. Even though this PITA brother of mine makes comments in <br/>\nfront of her to me like &quot;we can&#39;t stay, we don&#39;t HOMESCHOOL and have to get <br/>\nup in the morning&quot;. I have a feeling he knows what he is missing, and feels <br/>\nguilty. But i can&#39;t believe she was asking Megan that she doesn&#39;t go to <br/>\nschool. I would have loved to chime in, but I didn&#39;t feel it was my place to <br/>\npush our beliefs on her. Chances are, she would want to stop going to school, <br/>\nand her parents wouldn&#39;t accomodate that. I can only imagine what her daddy <br/>\nwould say to her questions. I actually feel like i am in a divorce situation, <br/>\nwith the ex&#39;s bad-mouthing the other parents/choices to the kids. Whereas I <br/>\nwould avoid criticizing her parent, I am willing to bet my brother would love <br/>\nto put our decision down to anyone that will listen!<br/>\nAng<br/>\nSAHM to<br/>\nMegan Elizabeth 8/8/92 8lbs 8oz<br/>\nAshlyn Olivia 7/25/99 9lbs 8oz<br/>\n Christian James 6/09/01 9lbs 5oz<br/>\n   &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.twgallery.8m.com/MEGAMOM08.html&quot;\">http://www.twgallery.8m.com/MEGAMOM08.html&quot;</a>&gt;Meet MEGAMOM08&lt;/A&gt;   <br/>\n &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/christian.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/christian.html&quot;</a>&gt;Christian&#39;s Birth Story&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/mygirlspage.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/mygirlspage.html&quot;</a>&gt;My Girls page&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n|w|w|<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37536,"nextTopicId":37559}}
