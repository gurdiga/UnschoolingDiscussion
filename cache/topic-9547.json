I am able to get about $200/week per child, so living frugally, that<br/>\nwould be managable.  Toronto has a fairly high cost of living, but I can<br/>\nalso charge more.  You woud have to phone around other care givers in your<br/>\nneighbourhood.  It does have a real impact on how much outside activity you<br/>\ncan do, as I don&#39;t have a car, and wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable driving other<br/>\npeople&#39;s kids, but there are always evenings and weekends.  I also have<br/>\nheard of people who offer to homeschool other people&#39;s kids for a fee,<br/>\nwhich may be viable for you.  It also means you would get older kids.<br/>\nBefore and after school care is also an option, and not so time consuming.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI may as well introduce myself now.  My name is christine, and I have two<br/>\nlittle girls, 4 and 1.  I am by profession a Montessori teacher, hence my<br/>\ncurrent occupation.  We are unschooling my children, and it I have found it<br/>\namazing to look at Maria Montessori&#39;s writings from that unschooling angle.<br/>\nAs I am sure many of you out there have already firgured out, thee isn&#39;t<br/>\nalot of difference.<br/>\nGotta go make dinner.  Good luck with finding work that will help you out.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9552,"nextTopicId":9559}}
