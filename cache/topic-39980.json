My ds (5 next month) is <br/>\n&gt; currently obsessed with dinosaurs and asked me to explain the difference <br/>\n&gt; between a coelophysis and a corythosauras and did I know what a <br/>\n&gt; rhamphorhynchus was? No, I sure didn&#39;t know but we got out his dinosaur <br/>\n&gt; books <br/>\n&gt; and looked it up. I definitely know less about dinosaurs than he does so I <br/>\n&gt; just need to learn how to help him find his answers and provide resources <br/>\n&gt; for <br/>\n&gt; him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And it keeps going. My son Julian, almost 13, just came back from a week at a <br/>\nMarine Biology Field experience. We went out to lunch and he described the <br/>\nresearch and experiements they did, all of which were totally beyond me.  He <br/>\ndescribed the graphs they made, etc. which demonstrated math skills that he&#39;s <br/>\nclearly learned by osmosis (which he also knew and found useful this past <br/>\nweek), since he&#39;s done virtually NO structured math since he left school <br/>\nafter the third grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe enthusiastically talked about all this stuff throughout lunch, and I <br/>\nfinally looked at him and said &quot;You are just so SMART!&quot;  He giggled and <br/>\nsmiled.  THEN he paid for our lunch using his brand-new debit card, figuring <br/>\nout how much tip to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is...not only do we not have to have all the answers, we can&#39;t and <br/>\nSHOULDN&#39;T. Takes a lot of the fun out of learning if we can answer all the <br/>\nquestions. AND it&#39;s important for the kid to have areas where they are the <br/>\nsmarter ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39968,"nextTopicId":39644}}
