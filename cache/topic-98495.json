The rice expands in those little birdy stomachs, causing our avian<br/>\ncompanions to explode, we&#39;re warned. Let&#39;s quit worrying about the birds.<br/>\nThey&#39;ll be fine. Seagulls don&#39;t explode when they eat Alka-Seltzer; pigeons<br/>\ndon&#39;t explode when they eat rice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis response to a 1996 Ann Landers column in which she &quot;informed&quot; readers<br/>\nabout the danger rice poses to birds just about says it all:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe USA Rice Federation in Houston has a message for advice columnist Ann<br/>\nLanders - straighten up and fly right when you talk about birds. In a recent<br/>\ncolumn, Landers warned readers that throwing rice at weddings is  unhealthy<br/>\nfor our feathered friends: &quot;Please encourage the guests to throw rose petals<br/>\ninstead of rice. Rice is not good for the birds.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This silly myth pops up periodically, and it is absolutely unfounded,&quot;<br/>\nresponded rice expert Mary Jo Cheesman at the USA Rice Federation. Many<br/>\nmigrating ducks and geese depend on winter-flooded rice fields each year to<br/>\nfatten up and build strength for their return trek to northern nesting<br/>\ngrounds. <br/>\n<br/>\nUncooked, milled rice is no more harmful to birds than rice in the field,<br/>\nCheesman said. The Curator of Ornithology at the University of California at<br/>\nBerkeley agrees. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s a myth. There is no reason why birds, including small songbirds, can&#39;t<br/>\neat rice,&quot; said Ned Johnson, a professor of biology at Berkeley who lectures<br/>\nfrequently on the food and feeding of birds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMany churchs and reception halls have rules prohibiting the throwing of<br/>\nconfetti or rice. These rules work to keep the property clean so that the<br/>\nnext happy couple doesn&#39;t get its send-off amid the leavings of the previous<br/>\npair. Confetti is notoriously hard to clean up; not even vacuuming a lawn<br/>\nwill return the grass to its pristine condition.<br/>\n<br/>\nRice poses a unique danger. Not to birds, though; to people. Scattered on a<br/>\nhard surface (such as the steps of a church or a dance floor) it puts anyone<br/>\nwho walks across that surface at risk of taking a nasty spill. Far better to<br/>\nprohibit rice throwing at a wedding than to end up with an injured guest.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t do it for the birds, do it for the inlaws.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbara &quot;slip covered&quot; Mikkelson<br/>\n============<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86181566,"authorName":"jennefer harper","from":"jennefer harper &lt;jenneferh2000@...&gt;","profile":"jenneferh2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Rice Box Play","postDate":"1092984653","msgId":98540,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwODIwMDY1MDUzLjIzMjM2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjExMzAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":98512,"nextInTopic":98541,"prevInTime":98539,"nextInTime":98541,"topicId":98495,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
