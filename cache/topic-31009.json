The one situation I can remember was regarding adults having sex with children.  As I remember, based on a paper that was published, psychologists were no longer to consider incest and other such acts to be harmful to children.

Since I analyze everything, it was easy for me to get past the rude, abrasiveness once I figured out that her main interest is to try to help inform her listeners that the behavior the caller has had can cause serious consequences.  She understands that in 3 min. it is unlikely she can really help a stranger over the phone.  However, if the people listening somehow get the message that, say, it is important for parents to be home with their kids, divorce can be devastating to children, certain behavior is destructive to marriages, yada yada yada, then maybe she has helped someone.  She often mentions what her PhD is in, that she is no longer a licensed clinical psychologist, that preferably mothers need to be home with their kids for at least the first year, even why she speaks to people the way she does and uses the words she uses.  She is a very religious person and uses her religious beliefs in forming some of her opinions.  I don&#39;t hold that against her.
