I am one who needs instant <br/>\ngratification! lol.  Well, my 10 year old went to the librarian to ask about <br/>\nit, she looked at me and said &quot;We have many copies but they are checked out, <br/>\nbut I think they would be uh ....a little challenging for  you.  They are at <br/>\nleast a thousand pages, and in paperback they are huge.  Then she showed him <br/>\nsome lighter fantasy about dragons which suited him fine.  However, NOW I <br/>\nHAVE to get that book!  I love thick books.  I checked out THE MEMOIRS OF <br/>\nCLEOPATRA by Margaret George, it is hardback and 964 pages long.  I love it!!<br/>\nthanks,<br/>\nTeresa  ; &gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"FreeSchool@aol.com","from":"FreeSchool@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"3V4tnRWFy5Ms5hWbKee0xvhMfXdY42zTan6DumyW3j7ppUY133j0hXtiGZ3btbEcuRe8CfKw-JSm","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Wheel of Time","postDate":"928825289","msgId":764,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy42NC43NjQuOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":712,"nextInTopic":789,"prevInTime":763,"nextInTime":765,"topicId":661,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/7/99 10:34:20 AM Central Daylight Time, Hsmotgo@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1837279893\">In a message dated 6/7/99 10:34:20 AM Central Daylight Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Hsmotgo@...\">Hsmotgo@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; k I have been living under, ( the Dragon Ball Z or <br/>\n Pokemon rock I believe)!

Alot of people haven&#39;t heard of Robert <br/>\nJordan, including me until a friend turned me onto him.  He is a writer of <br/>\nFantasy Books.  The Wheel of Time is one of his series.  If you like fantasy, <br/>\nyou will love his books.  They are all about a &#39;light side&#39;  and a &#39;dark <br/>\nside&#39; (kind of like Star Wars but not in outerspace with spaceships) and each <br/>\nhas powers.  There is, of course, a struggle for good to win over evil.  They <br/>\nare written for adults, although teenagers usually really enjoy them also.  <br/>\nHowever, they are very thick books, with alot of heavy reading.  They are too <br/>\ndifficult for your 8 and 10 year olds, (unless they are geniuses!  *smile*).  <br/>\nMy 17 year old loves them, he has caught up with me, on reading book 6, <br/>\nhowever he does have more time to read then I do.  My 13 year old is trying <br/>\nto read book 1, but I think he is going to give up and wait until he is <br/>\nolder.  He is<br/>\nhaving trouble getting through such a thick book.
