It is sort of a large question.  There are a lot of websites and information online (you can go to IdahoPagan even, and learn more in their Pagan University section.)  Pagan is a loose term that refers to many non-Judeo Christian religions.  It is not limited to poly-theistic practices, although there are many of those.  It can refer to beliefs as diverse as the Strega, Asartu, Voodoo, Celtic, Norse/Viking, Druid, Native American Shaminism, Eastern Religions, and many other traditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany folks who are one of these non-mainstream religions refer to themselves as Pagan, as a catch all phrase.  Some because it is much easier than explaining to every person they meet what Strega is, for instance.  Some because they do not ascribe to any particular classical set of beliefs, but rather have an eclectic set of personal traditions and beliefs.  Some for other reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease look around on the internet for information about what it is, if you are interested in learning more.  I believe the biggest and fastest growing group in this country and Great Britain is the Wiccans.  You can find LOTS of information about that online.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10964,"nextTopicId":11035}}
