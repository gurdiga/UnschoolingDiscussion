Sierra too but her&#39;s<br/>\nwasn&#39;t anger. It was more her just getting upset about something and<br/>\ncrying.....a lot. For her, it helped to let her cry and be alone and calm<br/>\ndown some. Nothing we did would help right away. After a while, I would hold<br/>\nher and tell her to breath. She would then calm down some more. Talking at<br/>\nthat time didn&#39;t help at all. I would only be able to talk to her about what<br/>\nhappened long after she was calm.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Joseph, he would get angry. Real angry over things, like you said, that<br/>\ndidn&#39;t seem to be a big deal. What really helped me help him, was to see<br/>\nthat it *was* a problem for him. It helped for me to try and understand what<br/>\nhe was feeling. To really understand that for him to get that upset, it was<br/>\na very big deal to him. So once I looked at it that way, I was able to talk<br/>\nto him about what he felt and why and how we could both figure something out<br/>\nso that he could handle it better when it happened again. Talking a lot to<br/>\nJoseph, and empathizing with him about how he felt helped him to manage it<br/>\nbetter. He seemed to take some comfort in me just trying tounderstand. I&#39;m<br/>\nsure his getting older was a key too. It took a lot of patience and<br/>\nunderstanding and talking on our part first though in order for him to take<br/>\ncare of what he was feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Children&#39;s tempers","postDate":"1058303356","msgId":76574,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDViLjNiM2M3NWZhLjJjNDVjNzdjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76572,"nextInTopic":76577,"prevInTime":76573,"nextInTime":76575,"topicId":76572,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/15/03 2:19:59 PM, pinklantern@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1120514963\">In a message dated 7/15/03 2:19:59 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pinklantern@...\">pinklantern@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; An example of this would be playstation games.
