A toy<br/>\n&gt;gun cannot be id&#39;ed as only a toy from another<br/>\n&gt;vehicle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My DSs all played with toy guns. With the first DS I<br/>\n&gt;thought we would  avoid gun play, but DS#1 constructed<br/>\n&gt;his own at about 18 months. Oh well. I bought him a<br/>\n&gt;water pistol when he asked for it.  They all had toy<br/>\n&gt;water pistols, cap guns, rubber band guns and at 7 or<br/>\n&gt;8 a BB gun, then at about 12, a rifle. My youngest<br/>\n&gt;DS#4, 7, has a BB gun, now.  And recently bought<br/>\n&gt;himself a cleverly made toy pop-gun.  He does know the<br/>\n&gt;difference, and when his little niece and nephew<br/>\n&gt;visited recently, he did not even allow them in the<br/>\n&gt;room where his guns were because they were too little<br/>\n&gt;and inexperienced to know how to behave...in his<br/>\n&gt;opinion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;None of my DSs cares to hunt. The older DSs have at<br/>\n&gt;different times shot chicken eating &#39;possums, rabid<br/>\n&gt;coon&#39;s, vicious feral dogs, and watermoccasins, and<br/>\n&gt;animals that have been hit (beyond recovery) by<br/>\n&gt;vehicles (dogs, deer)...other people driving, of<br/>\n&gt;course!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My brothers played WAR games as children, complete<br/>\n&gt;with blood curdling screams and explosion sound<br/>\n&gt;effects.

And recently bought<br/>\nhimself a cleverly made toy pop-gun.  He does know the<br/>\ndifference, and when his little niece and nephew<br/>\nvisited recently, he did not even allow them in the<br/>\nroom where his guns were because they were too little<br/>\nand inexperienced to know how to behave...in his<br/>\nopinion. <br/>\n<br/>\nNone of my DSs cares to hunt.

DH thinks this is silly, he<br/>\ngrew up in a no-gun household (they played with squirt bottles instead of<br/>\nwater pistols, etc... that is, until they got into the star wars figures and<br/>\nstar trek phasers), but I didn&#39;t want to corrupt our son&#39;s innocence, so<br/>\nattempted to shield him from anything with a gun.  No commercials, movie<br/>\npreviews, Star Trek, though he did watch Star Wars a while back - but he was<br/>\nonly 18 months old (I wonder if that&#39;s what did it!).  Never use the word<br/>\ngun around him.  Nothing.<br/>\nSo he plays, with his cars, or his wand that we made, or a random stick from<br/>\noutside, and makes shooting/spitting sounds like a gun, and he calls it a<br/>\n&quot;figther&quot; (since he doesn&#39;t know the word gun).  Where did he get this from?<br/>\nI can&#39;t say it&#39;s because he&#39;s a boy - how did boy genes get guns so quickly,<br/>\n(of course, I could say something about the male chromosomes and their<br/>\nability to mutate quickly, but I won&#39;t :p ).  I would think he would have<br/>\npicked up swordplay or something like that.<br/>\nAnd swords will be allowed in our home, we&#39;re looking at having someone make<br/>\nhim a wood sword and shield, as we&#39;re into the whole medieval thing, but<br/>\nalso into the respect and beauty part in there as well, not as a weapon for<br/>\nkilling, but as an artform.  But we weren&#39;t going to introduce that to him<br/>\nuntil he was older, and when he showed interest (if he showed interest).<br/>\nBut for now we hid all our weapons (we have a knife collection) and still,<br/>\nhe is into &quot;fighter&quot;s.  When asked more about these things, he says it makes<br/>\n&quot;little tiny holes&quot; in people and things for fighting.<br/>\nWho knows, he picked it up somewhere, thats for sure.  Makes me sort of sad,<br/>\nbut also searching for ways for him to express such things appropriately.<br/>\nFinding better hero models for him that will hopefully be better than what<br/>\nis readily available today (batman, superman, all those crappy after school<br/>\ncartoons...).  Was thinking of Robin Hood, Arthurian legend, more archetypal<br/>\nthings.  Anyone have any ideas?<br/>\nAnd since we have our daughter, Sheherazade, we were thinking of looking for<br/>\ngood Arabian Nights books for kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kristi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brendaclaspell@...\">brendaclaspell@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brendaclaspell@...\">brendaclaspell@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 28, 2001 1:09 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] kids playing guns<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ni just wondered what other parents did or thought about children playing<br/>\nwith<br/>\nguns. not real guns, but toy guns. we had a no gun rule then my son turned<br/>\neverything into a gun and so it turned into a don&#39;t point it at anyone rule.<br/>\n<br/>\ni just wondered how others handled this or other &#39;act out&#39; violence.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\nCheck it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnother great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
