Dh has collected the sets of star wars for years.  So, Ben happily took apart the sets his dad spend hours putting together.  It was fine with dh, btw.  Ben loves the little moving pieces and can make some really intricate things.  I got him the Lego Contraptions Books and kit from Klutz.  Great pieces!  He really likes to build things on his own.  Though he got one of the new knight kits and sat down and put it together from the instruction booklet, for the first time on his own.  Most of it was in the right place.  But, he creates all kinds of Lego things.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing he likes also is just junk.  He collects junk (his word).  He is always going into the garbage and taking out things.  So, now I&#39;ve learned to just set stuff in front of the garbage can.  Funny, when I hand it to him, it&#39;s just not the same.  I see a future dumpster diver in the making.  &lt;g&gt;  My mil take him to the store and buys him any stuff that he sees, styrofoam, yarn, sticks, tape, metal hoops, hinges.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all of the suggestions.  I have some great ideas now.  I think I&#39;m going with the Erector sets first.  I showed these to him on ebay, and he said &quot;That&#39;s it, just what I&#39;ve been waiting for my entire whole life in this universe.&quot;  So, that is a good sign, wouldn&#39;t you say?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe told me today that he wishes he could create this whole world that exists in his imagination.  He said then I could share it with you Mom.  I would love to be able to see all of the things that live in his imagination.  I can&#39;t imagine sending him to school.  My friend&#39;s daughter who is 13 says that Ben is a little too quirky to go to school.  I think she meant it as a compliment.  I&#39;m glad he gets to be himself.<br/>\nLaura J<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8023463,"authorName":"","from":"=?iso-8859-1?q?=20?= &lt;bjesch@...&gt;","profile":"bjesch2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: frustrated inventors","postDate":"1094771398","msgId":99442,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwOTA5MjMwOTU4LjEyNTMucW1haWxAd2ViODE0MDQubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwOTQ3NjM3ODguNTYzMC4xMDA4NC5tMjNAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":99439,"nextInTopic":99443,"prevInTime":99441,"nextInTime":99443,"topicId":99410,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Lego has a system called Mindstorms.

My son, 5-1/2, is always wanting to<br/>\nmake &quot;bachines&quot;.  Sometimes he&#39;s happy enough to make something pretend,<br/>\nsometimes he really wants to make the thing he has in his mind.  At the<br/>\nsame time, however, he&#39;s somewhat of a perfectionist and gets frustrated<br/>\nwhen he can&#39;t make things exactly the way he pictures them.  We&#39;ve done<br/>\nthe same thing as you, provided lots of materials of various types,<br/>\nincluding tons of duct tape.  What has helped immensely is the Lego kits<br/>\nfor older kids (7+) with their detailed instruction booklets.  He<br/>\nsometimes needs a bit of help, but he gets the satisfaction of building<br/>\nsomething &quot;real&quot;-looking and the additional satisfaction of following<br/>\ninstructions and doing it perfectly.  He hasn&#39;t gotten into the<br/>\ncreativity of Lego - building new things from parts you have - but he<br/>\nenjoys building the kits exactly to spec over and over and over again.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nSince your son doesn&#39;t want to build toys, this may not help, but it&#39;s<br/>\nhelped mine.

And I&#39;m not sure how to help him.  He has these amazing ideas about things he wants to invent or create or design.  Practically every ten minutes or so, he is talking about what new thing he is working on in his brain.  &quot;I&#39;ve got another great idea that I&#39;m bouncing around inside of my brain.&quot;  He wants to make computer games, robots, machines, electronic devices (he wants to make one that will wash fold and put away the laundry for me, I think he should start there) etc...  He comes to me and asks for things to make it with.  I ask him what he needs and he tells me metal, a generator or some other source of energy (we are in FL, so there have been lots of talk about generators lately), something to cut and melt the metal with, computers to run the robot, you see where this is going...  Anyhow, he wants the real thing.  I have gotten things from the thrift store to take apart, I give him all kinds of stuff boxes, tubes, wire etc...  we have electrical science kits with little motors.  But, he is almost in tears, well, in tears because he can&#39;t make a robot that will work.  He wants to make a real one, not a toy.  I give him old radios or other things to take apart, then he takes them apart and can&#39;t get it back together or he sees something he wants to make it do and can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing he is creating is this elaborate computer game and wants me to help him write the program to make it.  Okay, I have no clue here.  I&#39;m just now taking an HTML class myself.  I know there are classes for this type of thing, but for five year olds?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI tell him that maybe we can make some board games or I can write some of these story games down so that later, when he can do these things, he will remember his ideas.  He doesn&#39;t really draw well enough to express himself.  He is frustrated by that as well.  But, that is as lame as it sounds.  I tell him that maybe we need to find out the steps he will need to take to learn these things later on.  I said, you will probably need to know how to read and write, so maybe we can start there.  Again, how lame is that?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is so amazing and creative, a very intense kid.  He really wants to do this and talks about it all of the time, complete with sounds effects and actions.  I just don&#39;t know where to go with this.  I don&#39;t really know anyone who does this type of thing either.  He can&#39;t be the only frustrated five year old inventor around.  <br/>\nAny ideas?<br/>\nLaura J<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99407,"nextTopicId":99453}}
