Ha! That<br/>\nusually gets me some strange looks...<br/>\nI remember precisely when I decided I would homeschool. My oldest son (now8)<br/>\nwas 2 at the time. He was running down the hill to the barn laughing and<br/>\nlaughing. It suddenly hit me that he would be going to school in 3 short<br/>\nyears possibly earlier! My heart just collapsed and I couldn&#39;t even think of<br/>\nthe possibility of him going away for the whole day. I would miss him<br/>\nterribly, he would miss me, and there is always something interesting to do<br/>\non a farm. He would miss so much life! That did it, I started researching<br/>\nright then. I read and read and read ect.... I read John Holt, old Growing<br/>\nWithout Schooling Magazines, Old Home Education Magazines, and every book I<br/>\nsaw mentioned in the back of other books. I specifically drawn to John Holt<br/>\nand Grace Llewellyn. I learned from everything I read though. It made me<br/>\nsee how diverse homeschooling can be.<br/>\nI also researched the laws for my state during this time.<br/>\nI also looked into support groups, and made contact with a local one. It was<br/>\ninteresting to talk to everyone but my sons (we had added one during this<br/>\ntime) were much too young to do much. I then renewed contact later when all<br/>\nthree of my kids were older.<br/>\nI still read and read.... I still talk and talk.... It helps to share.<br/>\nI hope this helps you...and enjoy your family. That is what we do mostly.<br/>\nAnn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 8<br/>\nDate: Thu, 21 Jun 2001 23:49:54 -0000<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:diamondair@...\">diamondair@...</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: Encouragement please....<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Brandon Frantz&quot; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was wondering what your favorite source for encouragement is<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For me, part of my encouragement just comes from watching my kids and <br/>\nhow they learn.

We<br/>\nunschool in the sense of trusting that our children<br/>\nwill know when they are ready to take on tasks and<br/>\nfollowing their lead for what they want to learn and<br/>\nhow they want to learn it. My daughter is nine this<br/>\nmonth and took off on reading about 6 months ago. She<br/>\nspends a fair amount of time reading both fiction and<br/>\nnon-fiction, but also still loves to spend time with<br/>\nher various critters and engage in make-believe play<br/>\nwith her sibling and other children. She loves to<br/>\ndraw, but she HATESs to write. If she wants to leave<br/>\nherself a note, for example, to bring her tortoise in<br/>\nfor the night instead of writing out the words she<br/>\nwill draw a picture of the tortoise grazing and post<br/>\nthat where it reminds her. I have been fine with this<br/>\napproach and have trusted that when she is at a point<br/>\nin her life where she wants to truly express her<br/>\nfeelings she will feel compelled to write. I have<br/>\nkind of expected this will happen in adolescence. <br/>\nRecently an event happened that is causing me to<br/>\nquestion my judgement. Has anyone else out there left<br/>\nit up to divine providence that their children will<br/>\nindeed want to, and then proceed to, learn to write<br/>\nwhen they are ready? Has anyone any regrets about<br/>\nnot being more proactive with their child in teaching<br/>\nwriting?

When I first started <br/>\nhomeschooling, I was not an unschooler and had never even heard about it. <br/>\nBut I disliked the other kind of homeschooling because it was always coercive <br/>\nlearning and the thing is, what do you do if you tell the kids to do a math <br/>\npaper or write something and an hour later they&#39;re still sitting there <br/>\nthinking about other things? Some of my kids were this way. So then you get <br/>\ninto the &quot;discipline&quot; issues, meaning threats or blackmails, and it just all <br/>\nfelt wrong to me.<br/>\nWhen I found out about unschooling, it really appealed to me and we <br/>\ngradually moved more and more in that direction. At first I was afraid they <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t learn anything (a common concern) but I found that they learn more <br/>\ntheir way than they ever did before. They read a lot and each have their own <br/>\nunique interests.<br/>\nI have five boys, ages 4, 9, 13, 13, and 17. My 9 year old has some <br/>\nlearning difficulties and at times I have worried that he might need more <br/>\nstructured learning but he seems to be making some huge jumps lately. My 17 <br/>\nyear old just passed the California High School Proficiency test so he has <br/>\nthe legal equivalent of a diploma now. The kids value their freedom and <br/>\ndon&#39;t like me to schedule too many activities for them because they like <br/>\nhaving a lot of time. <br/>\nI have no regrets whatsoever and only wish that I had known to unschool a <br/>\nlong time ago. It would have saved my oldest son from some lousy experiences <br/>\nwith his kindergarten and second grade teachers. He was always a daydreamer <br/>\nand has become a very thoughtful and creative person but that wasn&#39;t valued <br/>\nin school.<br/>\nYour situation sounds incredibly interesting and I hope that you will <br/>\npost more about what you do there.

However her penmanship is horrible. My 2nd child - my son, I waited<br/>\ntill he was about 7 to attempt writing. We did the &quot;Teach Your Child to<br/>\nRead in 100 Easy Lessons&quot; - it worked for him. His penmanship is nice and<br/>\nneat. We also used the &quot;A Reason for Writing&quot; lessons. <br/>\nMy 3rd child is a lefty - I tried &quot;Teach Your Child&quot; method with her, we<br/>\nboth would end up frustrated. I decided to allow her to do as she wanted -<br/>\nno lines, no forced writing. She is not writing fluently, well she can&#39;t<br/>\neven write her name - but she is interested in learning because it is what<br/>\nshe wants to do, not what I am forcing her to do. I will write something on<br/>\na piece of paper and she will copy it on another piece.<br/>\nYou might try asking your daughter if she would like to put some of her<br/>\n&quot;make-believe&quot; stories in a book, and let her illustrate it also.
