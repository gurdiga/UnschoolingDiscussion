But, before<br/>\nmoving back here we lived in a &quot;bedroom&quot; community that commuters to SF<br/>\n&quot;found.&quot;  The population was 136,000 and climbing!  FAST!!!  With little or<br/>\nno intelligent planning.  I had to laugh about the 1/2 hour because it took<br/>\nthat long on an average just to get across town to where most of the<br/>\ngrocery stores were!  I worked less than a dozen blocks from my house and<br/>\nit could frequently take me up to 15 minutes just to get to work!  Here,<br/>\n1/2 hour takes us to the mountains to play in the snow or south to some<br/>\ngreat places to get fun and sun on the rivers.  10 minutes gets us the<br/>\nocean or the next town &lt;g&gt;  Guess the times are all relative.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re in the process of doing remodeling, the kitchen and bathroom thing<br/>\nbecause &quot;they&quot; (does anyone know who &quot;they&quot; is?) say that adds the most $$$<br/>\nto a sale price.  Then we will be putting it up for sale too with hopes of<br/>\nmoving before July (both hubby and I are July babies and thought that would<br/>\nbe a great present to ourselves &lt;g&gt;).
