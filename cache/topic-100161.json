She spent a <br/>\nmonth in 6th grade but no one knew she couldn&#39;t read because she <br/>\ncould sound out the words.  It turned out, when you put the words <br/>\ninto a sentence she had no clue what the sentence meant.  She <br/>\ndeschooled almost immediately, I think because she never really fit <br/>\ninto the school mold anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nSean, on the other hand, is just beginning to deschool after 3 years <br/>\nof being home.  He was 12 and supposed to be starting 7th grade when <br/>\nhe came out.  He&#39;s been back twice and he&#39;s left again twice because <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t like the way he was treated by the teachers but he likes <br/>\ntaking classes with a teacher and other students.  I always did <br/>\ntoo.  In a class you have others to talk to about what you are <br/>\nlearning and a teacher to help you when you just don&#39;t get it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for deschooling, I don&#39;t think Sean&#39;ll ever completely deschool <br/>\nin the way that kids who&#39;ve never been to school are or in the way <br/>\nthat Erica has, but he still has gotten a lot of benefits from being <br/>\nhome that have changed his life for the better.  He knows he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave to stay where he isn&#39;t being treated well.  He knows he can <br/>\nchoose what he wants to do and that he doesn&#39;t have to finish stuff <br/>\njust because he started it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t worry so much about the deschooling.

For those  of you <br/>\nthat have taken children out of school what has been the most helpful  with <br/>\ndeschooling and the child?  It is such a different ballgame with  children coming <br/>\nout of school and like my boys who have never had that  experience in their <br/>\nlives.

And it is <br/>\njust a substitute for school.  But then as an unschooler I say  well if that <br/>\nchild wants to go to the classes the mother is being supportive of  her child&#39;s <br/>\nchoice.  <br/>\n <br/>\nJust a question/thought.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100286,"nextTopicId":100473}}
