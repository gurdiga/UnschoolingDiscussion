The newspaper is 5 pages <br/>\nlong and they printed up a half-dozen copies to give out to people at our <br/>\npark day.

Ceramics is her passion - she&#39;s been involved <br/>\nwith a ceramics studio for about 4 years and she will be minoring in ceramics <br/>\nand majoring in creative writing when she transfers from the community <br/>\ncollege to UC Santa Cruz.  She came home from work and spent some hours <br/>\nworking on a website, creating collages out of pictures of friends, and also <br/>\nprinted up some stationary with pictures of friends along the edges. She and <br/>\nher dad went to a bookstore and bought some sort of feminist book, as she <br/>\ndescribed it, but I haven&#39;t seen it yet so I&#39;m not sure what it is. <br/>\n<br/>\nCyrus (my dh) took Roya to work and went to his work and picked Roya up early <br/>\nand went to an optometrist appointment. Then he came home and worked on our <br/>\ntaxes and took Roya to the bookstore. Judging from the dirty dishes in the <br/>\nkitchen, he concocted something from rice-a-roni and eggs and I think he also <br/>\nwatched a soccer game that he&#39;d taped from this morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoxana (14) was staying overnight at her friend&#39;s house.

Good Lord Bonni with all of that on your plate (I can relate because <br/>\nmy plate is stacked in buffet style portions for a death row inmate) your <br/>\nkids&#39; schooling is just the way I&#39;ve learned homeschooling to be for us.  She <br/>\npretty much does most of it on her own.  Some people wonder how much time it <br/>\ntakes and when I say &quot;30 minutes to 4 hours&quot; they can&#39;t believe it. The four <br/>\nhour ones are usually when we go somewhere specific for that time (museum, <br/>\nperformance, etc.)<br/>\nKelli has been devouring every resource she can in order to work with <br/>\nanimals. Last week she called vets and asked them some prepared questions. <br/>\nShe&#39;s very articulate and I&#39;m proud of her for that.  We arranged an hour <br/>\nlong visit at the animal hospital where a vet showed her the animals there <br/>\nand described what their status was, problems they had and how some could <br/>\nhave been prevented. She wants to start pet-sitting and today she exhausted <br/>\nme with that!  We called other pet sitting businesses and she got ahold of <br/>\ntwo women that talked to her for awhile about the business and what she could <br/>\nand shouldn&#39;t do, what to charge, what they did, etc.  She took notes and I <br/>\ntyped them right after the call.  Took us a lot of dials to make connections <br/>\n(I guess they were all out pet sitting dangit!)  She asked me to draft an <br/>\nadvertisement flyer on the computer (I had been promising it for awhile) <br/>\nsince she hasn&#39;t learned all the tricks and tools of MSWord and her typing <br/>\nisn&#39;t so hot. She&#39;s using Mavis Beacon to learn home row and the right <br/>\nreaches so she can type instead of writing some day. I guess that&#39;s one area <br/>\nthat I need to be more consistent in requiring her to do, she wants to write <br/>\nso much but gets frustrated at how sore her hands get. Being a writer myself <br/>\nI can relate so I want her so much to get typing skills, but its going to be <br/>\nat her own speed - you can&#39;t FORCE that at all =)<br/>\nShe&#39;s spent time this afternoon going to talk to neighbors with animals and <br/>\ngiving a couple of the flyers out, desperately hoping for a job!!  We talked <br/>\nabout volunteering and called the places and left messages.  Being 10 and <br/>\nDYING TO WORK WITH ANIMALS is hard on her. We have two kitties and they are <br/>\nold hat by now =/ LOL<br/>\nShe&#39;s been devouring her Chicken Soup For the Pet Lover&#39;s Soul, a book of Cat <br/>\nStories by Herriott (great vet and author), and I&#39;m reading aloud one of the <br/>\n&quot;All things Wise and Wonderful&quot; books (he&#39;s written a few.)  <br/>\nI guess you could say we are just animals animals animals here and that&#39;s all <br/>\nthat is on the brain!<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t use a textbook today, although if I find an ANIMAL reading <br/>\ncomprehension story in her book I&#39;ll bet she&#39;d do it Hehehehehehe  Same thing <br/>\nwith an ANIMAL math problem.  <br/>\nOur day...today...very enjoyable and very focused!<br/>\nKristine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109120623,"authorName":"Camille Bauer","from":"&quot;Camille Bauer&quot; &lt;goddessofwisdom2@...&gt;","profile":"granolamomi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Our day","postDate":"1018461635","msgId":34370,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERBVjI2RU5BOUZVREd5SVhZZXYwMDAwMWIwMUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":34402,"prevInTime":34369,"nextInTime":34371,"topicId":34370,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"my kids are ding various things.

But I am starting to come out of it.  I went<br/>\nseveral times with no sleep, complete insomnia, probably from<br/>\ninternalizing all my worrying.  That was almost like working graveyard<br/>\nagain:(    So, I don&#39;t feel I&#39;ve been giving my children the attention I<br/>\nnormally do.  On the other hand, unschooling has come through again.  <br/>\nMy son Rex has done nothing but read books non stop, one after the other,<br/>\nfrom morning to night!  And he always avoided books when he was going to<br/>\nps.  <br/>\nMy son Caleb has been playing a lot of chess, monopoly, yahtzee and<br/>\nbuilding games with his younger siblings, as well as watching a lot of<br/>\neducational public television.  He is the one who usually loves to read. <br/>\nHe has been coming up with new jokes every day.  He wants to make movies<br/>\nwhen he grows up, preferably comedies.  <br/>\nMy son Seth is a theorist who is always testing and figuring out how the<br/>\nuniverse works.  He looks sort of like a mad scientist.  He talks my ear<br/>\noff with his ideas.  He has been writing letters to others, addressing<br/>\nand stamping the envelopes and mailing them.  He asks me to correct his<br/>\nspelling, then he rewrites them.  At bedtime he has been reading books<br/>\nuntil quite late.  <br/>\nMy daughter Phoebe, in addition to playing boardgames, has been reading<br/>\nand making books.  She has a book she made called How I Feel.  Whenever<br/>\nthere is a trying time in her young life, she writes in it.  She feels<br/>\nthe stress we&#39;ve been under lately.  She taught herself cursive, and<br/>\nwrites a lot for the family, like shopping lists and our daily plan. <br/>\n(Every morning we talk about what we want to do and then make a list so<br/>\nno one gets overlooked.)  It amazes me how well she spells.  She just<br/>\nasks me if she doesn&#39;t know, and I tell her.  She often emails her aunt<br/>\nand grandma who live out of state.  Using spell check has helped her<br/>\nspelling, too, I suppose.  Somehow, I don&#39;t know how, because she<br/>\nabsolutely doesn&#39;t want me to teach her math and she never breaks out the<br/>\nmath workbooks, but she already knows almost as much as her older<br/>\nbrothers do.  Maybe because of the boardgames, and maybe because of<br/>\nplaying with the calculator.  But at the beginning of the year, she hated<br/>\nnumbers and avoided math like the plague.  Now she can keep up with her<br/>\nbrothers who are two and four years older than her when they try to<br/>\nfigure out how much things will cost or how many things there are to<br/>\nsplit between them.  She still only uses the bedroom clock because she<br/>\nhasn&#39;t memorized the hand clock and thinks it&#39;s a waste of time to count<br/>\nby fives when she can just run into my room and read the digital.  <br/>\nMy kids are all very sociable and have felt lonely lately, since I&#39;ve had<br/>\nmy head in paperwork and not taken them on as many outings as is usual<br/>\nfor us.  We live in a trailer park full of kids, but most of the neighbor<br/>\nkids are grounded lately. My older ones aren&#39;t interested in going to<br/>\nteen center anymore because, they say, the kids there only care about<br/>\ntelling dirty jokes, cussing and looking good.  I told my son Rex that if<br/>\nhe goes for a walk he will run into some kids his age.  I said that is<br/>\nwhat I used to do when I was young, and how I met some of my best<br/>\nfriends.  I hope that is not too lame.<br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34457,"nextTopicId":34498}}
