A month ago I got a <br/>\nlong chatty e-mail with an important question from someone I met in college.  <br/>\nDoes that count?<br/>\n<br/>\nI studied anthropology.  I had NO idea what it was before I went to college.  <br/>\n I loved it.  All my thoughts about culture and mothering and the role of <br/>\nchildren as children or as &quot;humans&quot; (members of the society) come through <br/>\nthat filter of what I learned in cultural anthropology.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I learned in Shakespeare classes (I eventually took four of those) is <br/>\nthat even the greatest professors are sometimes guessing.  And sometimes <br/>\nguesses are later proven to have been lame or plainly wrong.   (That message <br/>\nwas reinforced as I learned more about dictionaries and the history of words <br/>\nand about religion and the source materials involved with that, but it was in <br/>\na Shakespeare class that the light came on and examples flooded in from <br/>\neverywhere.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMonday I was playing Renaissance music with three friends.  I had a music <br/>\nteacher teach me recorder (I could play recorder, but he taught me to play it <br/>\nas it was played in the baroque, as a serious solo instrument) and he treated <br/>\nme like I had just as much potential to do that as anyone ever had.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was assigned to read John Holt there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn applied psychology classes I learned lots of things about how learning <br/>\nworks.  And in volunteering to be the subject in lots of psychology <br/>\nexperiments about learning and patterns and such, I learned about how those <br/>\ntests work and what&#39;s valid about them and what&#39;s totally goofy about them <br/>\nsometimes.  How flawed a correspondence type of &quot;proof&quot; can really be.  &quot;We <br/>\nhave a correlation.&quot;  Not always an impressive claim.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can throw pottery.  Haven&#39;t for a long time, but liked it lots when I was.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of those things I might have come to anyway.  Had I not been there, I <br/>\nmight have found the things elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve worked some jobs that needed no college degree, after I had one.  <br/>\nEmployers always seemed nervous, like I would bolt on them any second for <br/>\nbeing &quot;over qualified.&quot;  But what I had learned in college wasn&#39;t helping me <br/>\ndo what they were paying me to do.  I learned that stuff where I was.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCollege, if a kid wants to go there, provides lots more than the degree.  If <br/>\nwe believe in learning over paper, we should be the first in line to say <br/>\nhappy, voluntary college attendance can change a life even if the kid &quot;fails&quot; <br/>\nat completion of a degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we say &quot;You want to take a class?  Great!  have fun!&quot;<br/>\nor... &quot;Do you want to go there full time for a while?  Go for it!&quot; <br/>\nwe can help enable winners.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we do the same traditional mean stuff and say that FIRST they need to know <br/>\nwhat degree they want and THEN they need to buckle down and not socialize, <br/>\nand not take fun artsy classes, and THEN press them to finish quickly...   <br/>\nand tell them and all our relatives for decades that they screwed up and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t finish, if they don&#39;t have a degree, then what will we have learned <br/>\nfrom unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nDabbling is a glory.
