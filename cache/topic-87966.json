Knopf published the magical <br/>\nthriller, it jumped<br/>\nto No. 3 on the New York Times bestseller list for hardcover <br/>\nchildren&#39;s chapter<br/>\nbooks. This month it hit No. 2, outstripping four of the five Harry <br/>\nPotters.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaolini, now a lanky and poised 19-year-old with a fresh-scrubbed <br/>\nface, is<br/>\nclearly ecstatic. He reportedly sold the 528-page &quot;Eragon&quot; for a <br/>\nprice in the<br/>\nmid-six figures, and he&#39;s under contract to write two sequels for his<br/>\n&quot;Inheritance&quot; trilogy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough he has been accepted at Reed College in Oregon, he&#39;s not <br/>\nsure he&#39;ll go.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m getting paid to do what I love, and it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve stopped <br/>\nlearning,&quot;<br/>\nPaolini said at a recent book-signing. After all, before his book <br/>\ntour, he<br/>\nlistened to a taped college course on Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity <br/>\nand modern<br/>\nquantum physics. He insists &quot;it was lots of fun.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPaolini says he&#39;s glad he was home-schooled because it gave him the <br/>\ntime to<br/>\nwrite &quot;Eragon.&quot; But he believes the success of home-schooling is <br/>\ntotally<br/>\ndependent on the parents&#39; thoughtful involvement.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The problem with home-schooling is you can either get an incredible <br/>\neducation<br/>\nor you can get no education at all,&quot; he says. &quot;I do know of families <br/>\nin Montana<br/>\nwhose kids reach high school age and they don&#39;t know how to do basic <br/>\nmath and<br/>\nhave no background in literature because the parents were doing <br/>\ncanning and the<br/>\nparents said the kids were learning counting from canning.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike &quot;unschoolers,&quot; Paolini says, he and his younger sister <br/>\nfollowed a fairly<br/>\nregimented curriculum devised by their mother, a Montessori teacher. <br/>\nThey used<br/>\nhome-education materials by the A Beka Academy in Pensacola, Fla.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaolini&#39;s mother guided them until they reached high school age, when <br/>\nthey<br/>\nenrolled in an accredited online distance-learning program called the <br/>\nAmerican<br/>\nSchool.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We put ourselves through high school, essentially,&quot; he says. &quot;That <br/>\nwas one of<br/>\nthe most valuable lessons -- learning how to learn.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHome-schooling gave him wide latitude to pursue his interests in <br/>\nmusic, writing<br/>\nand computer games. He does not believe, however, that children <br/>\nshould be<br/>\ntotally free to decide what they study.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If it was up to kids, half the time you know you wouldn&#39;t be allowed <br/>\nto teach<br/>\nthem anything,&quot; he says. &quot;They don&#39;t understand how useful it&#39;s going <br/>\nto be<br/>\nlater in life or how much they&#39;ll end up enjoying it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAny personal examples?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I remember marching up to my mom and saying, &#39;I hate reading.&#39;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nÂ© 2003 The Washington Post Company</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164396504,"authorName":"Elizabeth Roberts","from":"Elizabeth Roberts &lt;mamabethuscg@...&gt;","profile":"mamabethuscg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: writer of eragorn-- hidden agenda?

How did Christopher Paolini do it? It was a family affair, <br/>\nMichael Shelden discovers <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a young man of 20, Christopher Paolini has lived a rather <br/>\nsheltered life. He has never been to school, never held a regular job <br/>\nand still lives in the old farmhouse along the banks of Montana&#39;s <br/>\nYellowstone River, where he grew up. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nMagical tales: Christopher Paolini <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he is not busy constructing a hobbit hut with an 8ft tunnel near <br/>\nthe river, he spends much of his time happily lost in a fantasy world <br/>\nof his own creation - a place he calls Alagaesia, where dragons roam <br/>\nand battles rage among sword-wielding tribes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time last year, he was just another geeky teen with too much <br/>\ntime on his hands. But now, thanks to Eragon, his 500-page rousing <br/>\nadventure story set in his imaginary world, young Christopher is <br/>\nsuddenly rich. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe British edition appears early next month, but already it is a <br/>\nhuge bestseller in America, where it has surged past the Harry Potter <br/>\nbooks. Almost half a million copies were sold in only two months, a <br/>\nscreenplay is in the works and at least a dozen foreign-language <br/>\neditions are on the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how is the new millionaire spending his fortune? <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, my dad bought a new computer, and we got this really cool <br/>\nplasma-screen TV. The picture is so good, we don&#39;t go to the movies <br/>\nany more. We just stay home and watch DVDs.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has also been ordering a lot of tapes to listen to around the <br/>\nhouse. Lately, his favourite is The History of Science Since the <br/>\n1700s.<br/>\n<br/>\nHome is a cramped living room with an old sofa and a wood-burning <br/>\nstove, a kitchen with a bare linoleum floor, a dark study and a few <br/>\nbedrooms. A cardboard box holds a load of logs for the fire, a <br/>\nwelcome feature, since it&#39;s freezing outside and the wind is howling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I suggest that a new house, or simply a family holiday, might be <br/>\nin order, the entire Paolini clan - father Kenneth, mother Talita and <br/>\nsister Angela, 18 - stare at me as though I wanted them to move to <br/>\nLas Vegas and take to drink.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We&#39;re not like other people,&quot; Angela says, with a gleeful smile. &quot;We <br/>\nknow we&#39;re weird, and that&#39;s fine.&quot; Her dad nods, but is more <br/>\ntemperate in his view of the family. &quot;Let&#39;s just say we&#39;re a little <br/>\neccentric.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nFor years, Kenneth and Talita - former members of a survivalist cult <br/>\nled by a woman called Ma Prophet - seem to have lived on a <br/>\nshoestring, with only occasional employment. Kenneth, the son of an <br/>\nItalian immigrant, used to be a photographer, but doesn&#39;t appear to <br/>\nhave had much work lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe and his wife have devoted their lives to their children, schooling <br/>\nthem at home and, until recently, rarely venturing outside their <br/>\nsmall community of Paradise Valley, Montana. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We like being together,&quot; Christopher says. &quot;If Nasa is looking for a <br/>\nteam of four people who can spend years with each other on a trip to <br/>\nMars, we&#39;re it.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich explains why you don&#39;t go to the Paolini house and just <br/>\ninterview Christopher. The whole family gathers round the kitchen <br/>\ntable and speaks in turn, answering my questions, correcting each <br/>\nother and asking questions of their own. Eragon - and the other two <br/>\nbooks in the Inheritance trilogy that will follow it - is a family <br/>\nbusiness. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it didn&#39;t start out that way. At first, there was just a lonely <br/>\nboy with a vivid imagination. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You see what it&#39;s like here,&quot; Christopher says, pointing to the <br/>\nrugged landscape outside, with its looming mountain peaks and snow <br/>\nswirling over the river valley. &quot;You have to do something to <br/>\nentertain yourself and keep busy. So I thought it would be kinda neat <br/>\nto write a story.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nInspiration came from long, intense days and nights of solitary <br/>\nreading - everything from Beowulf to Tolkien - and close observation <br/>\nof the world around him. His mountains and valleys were transformed <br/>\ninto a mythical land full of strange characters who seem like <br/>\nrefugees from The Lord of the Rings. His hero discovers a dragon&#39;s <br/>\negg, then makes a best friend of the newborn creature. <br/>\n<br/>\nGiggling like a little boy, Christopher says: &quot;Dragons make perfect <br/>\nfriends. They can eat anyone you don&#39;t like.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, well, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s useful, but how did he manage to create <br/>\n500 pages of this fantasy in so remote a part of America that even <br/>\nhis parents call it the &quot;middle of nowhere&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I was only 15 when I started Eragon. I didn&#39;t know how to write. I <br/>\njust told everything in one gigantic burst, then spent another year <br/>\nrevising it. My parents read it and thought it was great. But I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t really trust their opinion. After all, they&#39;re my parents. I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t surprised they liked it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHis mother points to the faded sofa in the living room. &quot;He wrote the <br/>\nbook sitting right there,&quot; she notes, with a grin of satisfaction. <br/>\nShe encouraged him all the way, but her husband was less enthusiastic <br/>\nuntil he saw the finished product.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My dad&#39;s not a big fan of fantasy books,&quot; Christopher explains. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, Kenneth saw its potential. It&#39;s an understatement to say he <br/>\nliked it: he and his wife were so smitten by the rough manuscript <br/>\nthat they decided to publish the book themselves in paperback and <br/>\nsell it online and in local bookshops.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenneth typeset it on his computer, his wife and daughter did the <br/>\nproof-reading and Christopher designed the cover. With the last of <br/>\nthe family&#39;s savings, they paid a printer to produce a few thousand <br/>\ncopies and went out into the world to hawk them. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;People told us we were nuts to do this,&quot; says Kenneth with a <br/>\nshrug, &quot;So what else is new?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nChristopher donned a home-made costume that was supposed to make him <br/>\nlook like a Renaissance storyteller and went to school libraries to <br/>\npromote his book. Didn&#39;t he feel self-conscious? <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Not a bit. It attracted a lot of attention and people wanted to know <br/>\nmore about the book. They would buy copies and I would sign them with <br/>\nmy tag line, &#39;May your swords stay sharp&#39;.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo everyone&#39;s amazement, the book was a huge hit, but the self-<br/>\npublishing business was onerous and unpredictable. &quot;Our house was <br/>\nfilled with copies of Eragon,&quot; says Angela. &quot;They were stacked <br/>\neverywhere. We couldn&#39;t handle the demand.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But when things didn&#39;t go well,&quot; her father interjects, &quot;it was <br/>\ntough. For a while, money was so tight that if we didn&#39;t sell books, <br/>\nwe didn&#39;t eat.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir big break came when the popular crime novelist Carl Hiaasen <br/>\nvisited the area on a fishing trip with his young son, and the boy <br/>\nbecame immersed in a copy of Eragon. On the way home, Hiaasen asked <br/>\nhis son why he couldn&#39;t put the book down. &quot;It&#39;s great, Dad,&quot; came <br/>\nthe reply, &quot;better than Harry Potter.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo a novelist who has had his fair share of bestsellers, those words <br/>\nwere magic. Hiaasen alerted his editors in New York, and the next <br/>\nthing the Paolinis knew, the prestigious publisher Knopf (a part of <br/>\nRandom House) was offering them a contract. <br/>\n<br/>\nChristopher excitedly recalls the day when he heard the good news. He <br/>\nis unreservedly grateful and is particularly impressed that Hiaasen <br/>\nhas never claimed any credit for himself. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We didn&#39;t even know what he had done until a few weeks ago. But he <br/>\nchanged our lives for ever. It made all the difference to get the <br/>\nsupport of someone like that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHis father greeted the news of Knopf&#39;s interest with caution and <br/>\ndecided to drive a hard bargain. He hired a powerful New York agent <br/>\nto do the deal. In the end, they secured a considerable advance from <br/>\nthe publisher.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We may live out in the middle of nowhere,&quot; Kenneth says, with a sly <br/>\ngrin, &quot;but we didn&#39;t fall off the turnip truck yesterday.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe former survivalists proved more than a match for the city folk, <br/>\nand now have so much money that they can&#39;t seem to bear the thought <br/>\nof parting with it. One reason is that, having been poor for so long, <br/>\nthey seem more comfortable saving than spending.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s our main stream of income,&quot; young Angela says, then adds with <br/>\nthe prudence of a country banker. &quot;We have to be careful how we spend <br/>\nit.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHer mother adds a bleaker note: &quot;About money, we have an acute <br/>\nunderstanding of the lack thereof.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA small woman with an air of quiet determination, Talita says that <br/>\nshe regards her son&#39;s book as a natural extension of his home <br/>\nschooling. She always wanted her family to be close and began by <br/>\ninsisting that she give birth at home. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the children reached school age, she didn&#39;t want outsiders <br/>\ninterfering with their lives. Now she can be proud that the education <br/>\nshe gave them has resulted in one becoming successful enough to keep <br/>\nthem all together.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Angela may be next.

I saw it too,  from HEM homeschoolers in the news.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just finished reading the book last week.  Pretty good,  I mean I read the whole thing in a few days, and its practically 500 pages!  So something held my interest.  It did bug me though that he borrows quite heavily from Tolkein.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has a new language going, maps, dwarves, elves, certain grotesque creatures chasing them.  He even has a wise old man who says some things that were darn exact to Gandalf&#39;s.   I guess he has a right to use these characters just like Tolkein did, but it just felt sooo similar.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as his comments,  sounds like his mother or who ever has really sold him on the idea that a required type of &#39;education&#39; is what is needed in childhood.     <br/>\n<br/>\nObviously he doesn&#39;t have a clue about unschooling and the complexities it involves.  I&#39;m wondering if he really ever met an unschooled family?   Sounds like he was heavily controlled,    <br/>\n<br/>\nHow about this statement:   &quot;Paolini says sometimes having his mom as his teacher made the mother-<br/>\nson dynamic more intense, but they managed. It might have been nice <br/>\nto grow up around more kids, but he&#39;s meeting plenty now on the <br/>\nlecture circuit.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t sound so great to me,  sounds like their relationship was strained and that he was sheltered.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, he&#39;s not an unschooler.  :(    I was hoping too,  when I heard he was homeschooled, but when it said he had finished high school at 15 I guessed that he wasn&#39;t.

Does this article <br/>\nmake this young man appear to have some sort of agenda against <br/>\nunschooling -- or am I a little paranoid? I haven&#39;t read the book...<br/>\ncris who is too paranoid being the only radical unschooler in this <br/>\nstate... <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/families/education/articles/1229homeschooledn\">http://www.azcentral.com/families/education/articles/1229homeschooledn</a><br/>\novelist-ON.html<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;quote:  Paolini says he&#39;s glad he was home schooled because it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>gave him the time to write &quot;Eragon.&quot; But he believes the success of <br/>\nhome schooling is totally dependent on the parents&#39; thoughtful <br/>\ninvolvement.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The problem with home schooling is you can either get an incredible <br/>\neducation or you can get no education at all,&quot; he says. &quot;I do know of <br/>\nfamilies in Montana whose kids reach high school age and they don&#39;t <br/>\nknow how to do basic math and have no background in literature, <br/>\nbecause the parents were doing canning and the parents said the kids <br/>\nwere learning counting from canning.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike &quot;unschoolers,&quot; Paolini says he and his younger sister followed <br/>\na fairly regimented curriculum devised by their mother, a trained <br/>\nMontessori teacher. They used home-education materials made by the A <br/>\nBeka Academy in Pensacola, Fla.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaolini&#39;s mother guided them until they reached high school age, when <br/>\nthey enrolled in an accredited online distance-learning program <br/>\ncalled The American School.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We put ourselves through high school, essentially,&quot; he says. &quot;That <br/>\nwas one of the most valuable lessons - learning how to learn.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPaolini says sometimes having his mom as his teacher made the mother-<br/>\nson dynamic more intense, but they managed. It might have been nice <br/>\nto grow up around more kids, but he&#39;s meeting plenty now on the <br/>\nlecture circuit.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve been in more schools with this book than I would have going to <br/>\nregular schools,&quot; he says with a grin. &quot;It&#39;s retribution, I guess.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHome schooling gave him wide latitude to pursue his own interests in <br/>\nmusic, writing and computer games. He does not believe, however, that <br/>\nchildren should be totally free to decide what they study.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If it was up to kids, half the time you know you wouldn&#39;t be allowed <br/>\nto teach them anything,&quot; he explains. &quot;They don&#39;t understand how <br/>\nuseful it&#39;s going to be later in life or how much they&#39;ll end up <br/>\nenjoying it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAny personal examples?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I remember marching up to my mom and saying, &#39;I hate reading.&#39; &quot; <br/>\n(end quote).</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88018,"nextTopicId":88021}}
