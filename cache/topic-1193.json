They say that<br/>\nit&#39;s impossible to not feel that something is missing.  I&#39;ve thought it&#39;s so<br/>\neasy to hang one&#39;s hat on such an issue.  We&#39;ve all got stuff to deal with<br/>\nin our lives, each one of us and the human mind wants to find answers.  But<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe that adoption is the answer to why one feels something is<br/>\nmissing.  So many of us at one time or another have felt that very same<br/>\nthing.  It certainly could be in certain situations just as a lousy family<br/>\nexperience could be the reason for lots of personal troubles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mother who regrets adopting a high need child and thought she should<br/>\nhave given her biological children more attention could easily be a mother<br/>\nwho had a bio child who had severe behavioral problems.  In her private<br/>\nthoughts, she might think how she wished she had never had this child and<br/>\nhow it strained the rest of the family&#39;s life.  The mother who has only bio<br/>\nkids doesn&#39;t get to have the easy answer that it was bc of an adoption.<br/>\nThere may certainly be lots more problems with adopting older children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thought I&#39;ve had about having children who aren&#39;t biologically<br/>\nrelated to you is that you get to go beyond the idea that the bond of love<br/>\nthat one experiences is somehow tied to blood.  I think lots of parents and<br/>\nchildren have that belief and I now think how limiting that is.  When your<br/>\nfamily is not biologically related to you you can be freed from that and you<br/>\nhave an opportunity to have that  inform how you view the world.  There is<br/>\nno &quot;reason&quot; for love.  It just is.  Many get to that place of understanding<br/>\nbut families who aren&#39;t biologically related I think, have that as a gift.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlison</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren","from":"&quot;Ren&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"adoption","postDate":"1085087181","msgId":94346,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNTIwLjE0MDcwNC4xMjAzMy4zMzczNUB3ZWJtYWlsMjQubnljLnVudGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":94312,"nextInTopic":94356,"prevInTime":94345,"nextInTime":94347,"topicId":1193,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"To bring an older child into a home and assume the standard ways of parenting will work is a recipe for disaster.

It shouldn&#39;t affect how any other adopted child feels anywhere in the whole wide world.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo of my siblings came at ages 9 and 11. I doubt you were adopted at either of those ages. They are Eskimo, my family is caucasion, it&#39;s pretty hard to NOT explain to inquiring people that they were adopted. Later, we adopted my brother at 2y.o., he&#39;s Athabaskan Indian. Our family, by the fact that we were culturally mixed, had obvious distinctions between the adopted and biological children.<br/>\nNone of us were treated any differently, we were all our parent&#39;s children. My folks didn&#39;t introduce them differently or act any  different towards them, but it was pretty obvious they didn&#39;t get in our family by birth!<br/>\nIt was after years and years of heartbreak, my mother watching her adopted children go through extremely destructive behavior, land in jail time and again (my brother), abusive relationships they chose and neglectful parenting of their own children (my neice and nephew are being raised by Grandparents on the other side of the family) and so much sad and terrible experiences that my mother decided she&#39;d done NOTHING to help these children and all the tons of hours and energy she&#39;d put into those children would have been better spent on her own.<br/>\nI agree.<br/>\nI still love my adopted siblings, although I rarely have contact due to their destructive lifestyles. I KNOW that my Mom would have been a better Mom, our lives more peaceful and happy had she not adopted.<br/>\nI&#39;m still glad she did it. It was part of my journey and I do believe that it may have helped their lives in some way....even if it&#39;s just that they have a parent figure they love and can rely on to this day.<br/>\nWe have a special connection, my adopted siblings and I, even if it doesn&#39;t run as deep as my birth sibs only because of the age when they came.<br/>\nWe felt lovingly connected at my mother&#39;s death bed and in our hearts we are sisters forever. But there was so much heartbreak for my parents that goes on still today (for my Dad anyway), I totally understand why she felt that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh is adopted too. I can tell you that being adopted at 4 months is a whole different world than being adopted at 11.  If you can&#39;t see that there is a different bond a parent makes with a child that is with them from birth, and a child that is half raised, then there&#39;s not much I can say to help you understand.<br/>\nThere WAS a difference between the adopted siblings and the birth siblings in our home.

After I sent the e-mail the other day about there being two situations of secret adoption in my family, I realized there are actually three that I know about, plus at least one secret child living with another family. Many more lies going on about other things, too. It&#39;s all so hard to keep up with, I simply don&#39;t talk about family stuff with family. Heck, Kelly likely knows at least some of the family, living in Columbia. They&#39;ve always been here, I&#39;m the newcomer! (Last name Redmon ring a bell, Kelly? LOL) My parents moved away when I was a baby because of the secret my mom wanted to keep from her father. As a result, I never got to meet the man, that I remember. He was murdered when I was about 10. Lies do hurt and eat away at the fabric of the family, but it does happen.... all the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have relayed the fact that most of you who were adopted have very positive feelings and experiences, and the family members I relayed it to are considering it.
