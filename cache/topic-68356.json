He never adored it <br/>\n(mostly homework), but in Kindergarten and first grade he was pretty happy. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn Kindergarten he had this teacher named Claire (I always thought it was a <br/>\ngood sign when the teachers invited parents to call them by their first <br/>\nnames....I wish it applied to the kids too, but I don&#39;t think they were <br/>\nallowed to.), who was always very careful about how every aspect of the class <br/>\nwent, paying close attention to each child. It was remarkable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn first grade he had Jane, who was even more in tune with the kids. She <br/>\nwould greet each one every morning and say goodbye with a hug, call them <br/>\ndarlings, remember to ask each kid every day something about home that she <br/>\nremembered....and none of it was in a gushy sick-sweet way. She just loved <br/>\nthem. (One of the interesting things we noticed about this class is that the <br/>\nchildren were remarkably kind to one another. Apparently if it&#39;s clear that <br/>\nthe teacher really believes you&#39;re all special and valuable, the other kids <br/>\ndo, too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he got to second grade, he had a perfectly okay person as a <br/>\nteacher...but from the very first, it was clear that she was just his <br/>\nteacher; she didn&#39;t LOVE him. That was hard for Julian (and us). By third <br/>\ngrade, he had a couple of teachers who were new, and some of the time I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t even sure they LIKED him.  And that was the end of that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish all kids who need to be in school for whatever reason got to have <br/>\npeople like Claire and Jane. <br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68353,"nextTopicId":68364}}
