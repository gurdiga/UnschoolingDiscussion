Kiele (4)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-743957466\">Sorry about the double post.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to share...<br/>\nMy day started out with clearing off the deck so the kids could ride their bikes and play.  Kiele (4)  grabbed a rake and started to rake the leaves off of the deck, Nicholas(4) and Michael (2) ( the 2 boys I watch) were just dropped off, Michael played cars with 11 month old crew, while Nicholas grabbed a broom and swept the dirt, bird seed and leaves off.  They did this on their own, they wanted to be a part of making the deck look nice so they could play on it.  After we were done, the kids played on the swingset while I hosed the deck off.  I nursed Crew to sleep then started to fix the driveway ( it was all rutted with mud and tire marks so I tore it up and filled it in and tamped it down)  whoo, now where was I?  Oh and more mud the 3 kids enjoyed playing in the gloopy gloppy mud and squishy ishy mud puddle!  Before long they had taken off there boots and were squishing around in it in their bare feet.  They had a blast throwing rocks into the puddle to see them sink, Kiele found a plastic toy and was surprised to see that it floated, and told me so!  Nicholas was curious to see if there were bugs in the mud and examined it  for some...after the mud incident kiele, Nicholas, and Michael all jumped in the tub with bathing suits on and of course lots of bubbles to wash and scrub all that mud!  we just had the best day enjoying the  sunshine and mud today!<br/>\nHeather<br/>\nWho happens to find that mud can be fun!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, March 17, 2003 6:22 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Future of unschoolers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 3/17/03 2:29:05 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; I think the most you could do would be change the daydreams from happy <br/>\n  flying <br/>\n  ponies to murderous revenge daydreams.<br/>\n    &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well....admittedly, I had plenty of murderous revenge daydreams, including <br/>\n  taking guns to heaven and shooting God.
