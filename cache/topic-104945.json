We HAVE to tune a lot of it out.   Six <br/>\nbillion people aren&#39;t all having a good, peaceful time while you read  this.  And <br/>\nthat&#39;s just the people.   You seem to be putting a lot  of healing energy <br/>\ntoward chickens you&#39;ve never met and cows you heard or read  about.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou ARE in a bubble, with your baby.  And you should be.  She  should have <br/>\nALL of you.<br/>\n <br/>\nWouldn&#39;t it be nice if all babies had their mother&#39;s full attention?<br/>\nIf you spend much time thinking about that, your baby doesn&#39;t have your  full <br/>\nattention.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-We have to <br/>\nthink about how our actions affect others but not neglect  ourselves in the <br/>\nprocess. <br/>\nI grew up in a family like this. I fell by the  wayside while my mom was <br/>\n&quot;doing good&quot; for others. She was always nasty at  home........much like <br/>\nliving with <br/>\nan alcoholic. <br/>\n-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nNot only are some things genetic, but living with an alcoholic or anyone  <br/>\nLIKE an alcoholic creates behaviors in the children that affect the  <br/>\ngrandchildren.  People have documented the heck out of this.  Even if  the offspring <br/>\ndidn&#39;t ever drink, they act like people whose parents drank, and  their children <br/>\n(NOT the children of alcoholics) can be affected by inexplicable  controlling <br/>\nand distracted behaviors.   The purpose of Adult Children  of Alcoholics is to <br/>\nhelp people get past those problems.  It helped me a  lot.    Now there are <br/>\nwebsites and people don&#39;t even have to  go to a meeting to get some of the <br/>\nbenefits.<br/>\n <br/>\nFour of us stopped on a road trip to visit a friend of mine who reads tarot  <br/>\ncards.  We&#39;d stopped just to visit, but she offered readings.   Cool!  One of <br/>\nthe four of us was newish to the group, and the girlfriend of  the only male.  <br/>\nAs we sat through her reading, the other three of us  glanced at each other <br/>\nseveral times with big eyes, and took in our breath at how  bang on the reading <br/>\nwas.  (Having known each other a long time, what I  described above sounds <br/>\nblatant, but we were really subtle, and the subject is  NOT good at social <br/>\nclues, so she probably wasn&#39;t noticing us at all  anyway.)   The reader asked at <br/>\nthe end if any of it had seemed right  or useful (don&#39;t remember how she asked), <br/>\nand the new friend said &quot;No, it  sounded as though you were reading for <br/>\nsomeone else, not me.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is not a defense of tarot cards.  I have no strong feelings one  way or <br/>\nanother about that. It&#39;s about people not seeing traits in themselves  that <br/>\nothers clearly see.  Our reader-friend did another reading, which was  quick, <br/>\nbland, and sounded like it was about someone else, or no one.  The  first one <br/>\nhad been &quot;the right one,&quot; the right first impressions of someone used  to <br/>\ndenying her own projections and reflections.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104944,"nextTopicId":104949}}
