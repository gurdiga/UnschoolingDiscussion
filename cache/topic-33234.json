Any expense for transportation of the <br/>\nremains must be borne by the estate of the<br/>\ndeceased. Even though an individual is buried at sea, a memorial marker <br/>\ncan still be placed in a National<br/>\ncemetery engraved with the standard grave stone information. ( Excerpts <br/>\nRAO Moody AFB GA July 1991.) <br/>\n<br/>\n6-11a BURIAL AT SEA PROCEDURES <br/>\n<br/>\nRetired Navy members and their dependents are entitled to burial at sea. <br/>\nAnyone desiring burial at sea should<br/>\nindicate that preference in writing. At the time of demise, the <br/>\nexecutor/executrix of the estate should contact: <br/>\n<br/>\nOffice of Medical/Dental Affairs (MEDDEN AFFAIRS) <br/>\nMortuary Affairs, Bldg 38H <br/>\nGreat Lakes, Illinois 60088-5200 <br/>\nToll Free: 1-800-876-1131, Ext. 629 <br/>\n<br/>\nAn information packet can be sent or FAXed to you.

If the preference for burial at sea was not <br/>\nput in writing by the retired member, the<br/>\nperson responsible for disposition of the remains may authorize burial at <br/>\nsea. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe following documents must be submitted to the proper &quot;port of <br/>\nembarkation&quot;, which will be listed in the<br/>\ninformation package available MEDDEN AFFAIRS, with the request form: <br/>\n<br/>\n* Certificate of cremation or a transit permit issued by the appropriate <br/>\ncivil authorities at the place of death;<br/>\nor <br/>\n*Photocopy of civil death certificate; and <br/>\n* Signed request/authorization for committal from the primary next of kin <br/>\nor executor of the estate <br/>\n*Photocopy of retirement orders <br/>\n<br/>\nThe authorization should include the decedents full name, grade, Social <br/>\nSecurity number, and file/serial<br/>\nnumber (if available); branch of service; date of retirement or dates of <br/>\nservice and date of death; type of<br/>\nreligious service desired; and whether scatting of cremated remains from <br/>\na naval vessel/aircraft, or committal<br/>\nof casket remains is desired from a naval vessel; and the body of water <br/>\nin which the cremains/remains should<br/>\nbe committed. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt should be noted that the Navy does not offer free cremation services <br/>\nfor its retirees and veterans. The only<br/>\nexception is if a retiree is hospitalized in a military hospital at the <br/>\ntime of death. In this case, the survivors are<br/>\nentitled to all mortuary services at government expense, including the <br/>\nassistance of the military services in<br/>\nmaking funeral arrangements. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, advance arrangements cannot be made because compliance with the <br/>\nrequest would depend upon<br/>\nweather conditions and the availability of a ship at that time. Services <br/>\non board ship while in port may be<br/>\npermitted on a &quot;not to interfere&quot; basis; however, civilian personnel <br/>\ncannot be authorized to attend services at<br/>\nsea. Any expenses incurred for delivery of remains/cremains to the point <br/>\nof embarkation on board a naval<br/>\nship must be borne by the estate of the deceased. Remains to be committed <br/>\nshould be in a state of<br/>\npreservation that will allow them to be stored for 60 days. For more <br/>\ninformation please call or write<br/>\nMEDDEN AFFAIRS. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn alternate to burial at sea from a naval vessel/aircraft is burial at <br/>\nsea from a United States Coast Guard<br/>\n(USCG) vessel. The USCG has more stations along the coasts of the US than <br/>\ndoes the Navy. In areas where<br/>\nthe nearest naval activity is hundreds of miles away, the cost to the <br/>\nfamily of transporting the remains and<br/>\nfamily members to the services could be prohibitive. In addition, the <br/>\nUSCGs mission provides much more<br/>\nflexibility and availability of vessels to accommodate burial at sea, and <br/>\nwhen mission obligations and<br/>\nweather conditions permit, civilian personnel are permitted to attend the <br/>\nservices at sea. As with the Navy,<br/>\nadvance arrangements cannot be made. Interested persons should contact <br/>\nthe nearest USCG station, which is<br/>\nusually listed under the Department of Transportation in the local <br/>\ntelephone directory.
