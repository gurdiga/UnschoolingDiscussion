(I am not sure why- cannot trace it back to any certain event <br/>\nand dh and I are dog lovers as we had them as kids etc. We do have a <br/>\ncat- so it is not all animals.) ANYWAY, I know it is a common childhood <br/>\nfear and that we have run into other kids who are also afraid of dogs. <br/>\nI wanted to mention it so that if you must bring your dog and if dogs <br/>\nare allowed to be off leash- you will keep the leash on anyway- and <br/>\nunderstand why my daughter will walk F A R  A W A Y  A R O U N D  Y O <br/>\nU  A N D  T H E  D O G, but my sons will runrightintoyouandthedog  and <br/>\nI will be torn in two:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your consideration regarding this matter. <br/>\nSusan Jones</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38408,"nextTopicId":108111}}
