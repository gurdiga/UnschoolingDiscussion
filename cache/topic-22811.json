I&#39;m not 100 percent sure. But I know<br/>\n&gt; enough to tell it is an incredibly bad, hopelessly intrusive idea that<br/>\n&gt; makes George Orwell seem like a prophet.<br/>\n&gt; Backers of the plan, notably one Gov. John Kitzhaber, say that with so<br/>\n&gt; many broken, dysfunctional families, the state needs to do more to<br/>\n&gt; identify and help at-risk children.<br/>\n&gt; The plan calls for screening all first-born infants about 18,000 a<br/>\n&gt; year in the state for medical problems and risk factors that could<br/>\n&gt; lead to abuse or neglect, or cause children to fail in school. Nurses<br/>\n&gt; and other professional busybodies would have license to visit homes of<br/>\n&gt; new parents to check them out for drug use and alcohol problems among<br/>\n&gt; other things.<br/>\n&gt; Like what other things? Well, already hospitals and doctors in Oregon<br/>\n&gt; and elsewhere survey new parents on subjects such as whether they keep<br/>\n&gt; guns in the home. Children, too, are sometimes asked these questions<br/>\n&gt; in visits with pediatricians.<br/>\n&gt; In other words, this is about social engineering by the state not<br/>\n&gt; diagnosing medical problems. This is just another power play by<br/>\n&gt; government to see how far people will allow Big Brother to go in<br/>\n&gt; insinuating itself into the most intimate details of your private<br/>\n&gt; family life.<br/>\n&gt; And the sad part is there doesn&#39;t seem to be any understanding growing<br/>\n&gt; within our country that government is far exceeding its constitutional<br/>\n&gt; and proper authority. No one really seems to be all that concerned<br/>\n&gt; about invasions of privacy.<br/>\n&gt; The costs of such power plays are stunning.<br/>\n&gt; In Oregon, this program is expected to cost $66 million a year. That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; a lot of money in a small state. In fact, if you took that money and<br/>\n&gt; merely redistributed it to the 18,000 families under scrutiny every<br/>\n&gt; year, you could gift them each $3,667.<br/>\n&gt; Now, I&#39;m not into redistribution of wealth. But, if the goal were<br/>\n&gt; really to help these folks, which, of course, it isn&#39;t, don&#39;t you<br/>\n&gt; think the cash in the pocket would do more than the snooping?<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m amazed. I sit here continually astonished at the way Americans<br/>\n&gt; from coast to coast watch their freedoms disappear without a concern<br/>\n&gt; in the world. Think of the sacrifices that were made so that our<br/>\n&gt; country would not end up as another totalitarian gulag state. But we<br/>\n&gt; see ourselves plummeting down the slippery slope toward tyranny, and<br/>\n&gt; many of us embrace it because we feel more secure and safer under the<br/>\n&gt; watchful eyes of the nanny-state. It makes me sick.<br/>\n&gt; What can we do about it? That&#39;s the key question. Every day, people<br/>\n&gt; hopefully ask me how to stop these disturbing trends, reverse them,<br/>\n&gt; get our country back.<br/>\n&gt; The first step is always being informed understanding the threats and<br/>\n&gt; fighting them.<br/>\n&gt; A great resource for understanding the encroaching power of the state<br/>\n&gt; and other forces attacking our privacy rights is a new book by Michael<br/>\n&gt; Hyatt. It&#39;s a great primer, and it offers a blueprint for protecting<br/>\n&gt; yourself and fighting back.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s called &quot;Invasion of Privacy: How to Protect Yourself in the<br/>\n&gt; Digital Age,&quot; and it is available in the WorldNetDaily online store.<br/>\n&gt; If you think I&#39;m just simply hyping another product that happens to be<br/>\n&gt; in the WorldNetDaily store, sample it free for yourself.<br/>\n&gt; Last week, WorldNetDaily offered a serialization of the first chapter.<br/>\n&gt; The hotlinks to that series are offered below. Hyatt explains that<br/>\n&gt; privacy in our digital age is often literally a matter of life and<br/>\n&gt; death. Whether the invasions come from private companies or government<br/>\n&gt; agencies, there are always unintended consequences and hidden agendas<br/>\n&gt; behind the intrusions.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s time to say, &quot;Enough is enough. I&#39;m not going to take it<br/>\n&gt; anymore.&quot; It&#39;s time to just say no to the professional snoops<br/>\n&gt; especially those we pay with our hard-earned tax dollars.<br/>\n&gt; Related articles:<br/>\n&gt; Part 1: Why personal secrets are no more<br/>\n&gt; Part 2: Who&#39;s tracking you?<br/>\n&gt; Part 3: Is technology the problem?<br/>\n&gt; Joseph Farah is editor and chief executive officer of<br/>\n&gt; WorldNetDaily.com and writes a daily column. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22810,"nextTopicId":22789}}
