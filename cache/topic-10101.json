To rain paint you put drops of food coloring on a <br/>\npaper plate and go out into the rain with it and it supposedly makes a <br/>\nbeautiful picture.   WELL......we did end up with beautiful pictures and we <br/>\nhad fun too.  But leave it to me to pick a day when it is REALLY raining to <br/>\ntry this project.  Lili and I did our food coloring drops and headed out <br/>\ninto the downpour only to have the rain SPLASH food coloring all over <br/>\nus!!!!!  Oh well, C&#39;est la vie.  &lt;grin&gt;  We had a lot of fun doing it but I <br/>\njust thought you might be warned that if you should ever try this project to <br/>\nwear clothes that you don&#39;t really care that much about and to be prepared <br/>\nto do some scrubbing on your  skin when you are done!   Lili and I both look <br/>\nlike we caught some weird polkadot skin virus!  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly<br/>\n<br/>\nps....Just thought I&#39;d add that even though I ruined my favorite pair of <br/>\nshorts....the ruined clothes were worth it!  Lili had so much fun!<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10045,"nextTopicId":10114}}
