We have had at<br/>\nleast 2 dogs at all times during the last 20 years (we currently have 5).<br/>\nWe have never used a heartworm preventative and have never had a dog go to<br/>\nthe vet for an illness (One went after being hit by a car and one went after<br/>\nbeing bit by a snake).  Any dog that has died has been of old age.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh is an EMT and went to a training last night that he found very<br/>\ninteresting.  The speaker stated that back before they started trying to get<br/>\neveryone to have CPR training, if your heart stopped away from a medical<br/>\nfacility, you had a 6% chance of living.  Today with so many people having<br/>\nCPR training, lots of places having defibrillators (sp?) on site, advances<br/>\nin medicine, better trained paramedics and better equipt ambulances, if you<br/>\nhave a cardiac arrest away from a medical facility, you still have a 6%<br/>\nchance of living.  Wow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho is it that makes us believe that better medical training and treatment<br/>\nis what makes the difference between life and death in these situations?<br/>\nThe people who make their living providing medical training and treatment.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44945,"nextTopicId":44923}}
