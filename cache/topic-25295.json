Many of the monks had died, and it was down to the <br/>\nlast eight monks, who were responsible for keeping the monastery up. They <br/>\nwere worried about how the monastery was going to function in the future as <br/>\nthey got older. Thus they passed their day worrying, and because they were <br/>\nworrying they bickered a lot, until the bickering and the worrying just <br/>\nbecame normal. And so they passed their days in this state. One day, a <br/>\nstranger showed up on their door step and announced to them that one of them <br/>\nwas the messiah. The stranger was greeted with derision at first, the monks <br/>\nthinking this was nonsense. Each monk looked around the table at the seven <br/>\nother monks, and thought to himself, well it couldn’t be that monk, because <br/>\nhe eats too much, and it couldn’t be that monk, because he does a horrible <br/>\njob of building, and it couldn’t be that monk because he is too loud. Each <br/>\nmonk then thought, &quot;well maybe its me, maybe I am the messiah. Well I don’t <br/>\nknow, I’m not so good either.&quot; Pretty soon though, the monks were looking at <br/>\neach other a little differently. &quot;Ok, so Sam is loud, he does have a kind <br/>\nheart.&quot; Each of the monks began treating each other as if the other was the <br/>\nmessiah. Pretty soon, the bickering stopped and the worrying stopped, because <br/>\neach was too concerned with treating the others as the messiah should be <br/>\ntreated. Pretty soon, the word got around that there was this monastery where <br/>\nthe monks treated each other with extraordinary kindness, and people began to <br/>\nvisit. Soon enough people began to join, and the monastery was able to <br/>\nreinvigorate itself, and the monks were delighted that the monastery was a <br/>\nplace of happiness and peace again.<br/>\n    <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25158,"nextTopicId":24964}}
