We talk about how important and special siblings are and how when they are older they will really enjoy having siblings.  Even is they don&#39;t enjoy them now. (Like if the younger is getting annoying).  Also I do alot of telling them stories of how I felt being a youngest child and it really affected how I felt about myself. ( My older siblings were very resentful of me and were very angry with me all the time. ) I don&#39;t shame them or blame them, but talk about how they are feeling.<br/>\nThey seem to really treat the younger ones better when they see it as a special thing to have a younger sibling.  Those younger ones really look up to the older and when the older ones figure that out they are so proud of it!<br/>\nHope it helps,<br/>\nTake Care,  Kelli<br/>\n Stephanie Elms &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stephanie.elms@...\">stephanie.elms@...</a>&gt; wrote:I enjoyed it too.

I think it&#39;s just part of being siblings. Every child with a brother or sister that I&#39;ve known has gone through that &quot;let&#39;s get a rise out of the other&quot; stage. I handled it by letting Tyler know that whenever Brett was bugging him, to say &quot;stop doing that, please&quot; and had a talk with Brett about how when he says &quot;stop&quot; to someone, he wants and expects them to listen to him, so he needs to do the same when someone tells him to stop. I told Tyler if Brett didn&#39;t stop after being asked, that he could always come to me and we&#39;d do something fun together. When he did, Brett would eventually wonder up wanting to join in - I left it up to Tyler whether or not Brett could join, since it was Brett&#39;s actions that caused Tyler to come do whatever in the first place. About half the time, Tyler wouldn&#39;t let Brett join, and I think that made the biggest difference of all. I guess that stage lasted a little over a year, and it still surfaces now and then, but now Tyler has gotten sneaky and will get back at Brett in other ways, and Brett knows it.
