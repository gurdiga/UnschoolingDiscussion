We do not live in a vacuum and our and our children&#39;s<br/>\nbehavior impact others.  Example:  My 3yo is a different kind of a kid.  He<br/>\nis my 4th child and I had over 20 foster kids so it isn&#39;t like I have<br/>\nnothing to compare him to.  He is tremendously loud, he is tremendously<br/>\nactive, he is tremendously tactile.  He is an in your face, yelling (at<br/>\nleast it seems like it to the listener) little whirlwind.  He is prone to<br/>\ntremendous meltdowns.  We work with him at home and try to maneuver our<br/>\nlives around so he doesn&#39;t have to be overly stressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to shop when dh can stay with Danny.  I try to make sure when he does<br/>\nhave to come with me places that we have snacks, he is rested, has something<br/>\nto occupy him, etc..  We still have meltdowns in public places.  He gets<br/>\noverly excited and loses it, yelling, hitting, throwing things.  I can&#39;t<br/>\njust leave, because if I could have possibly scheduled things differently or<br/>\nhad a sitter for him, I would have.  Sometimes, I am OK and sometimes I&#39;m<br/>\nnot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think that it belittles parents to assume that if they just always<br/>\ndid things &quot;right&quot;, then situations would work out fine and all would be<br/>\nhappy.  Sometimes, my kids have bad days, sometimes I do, sometimes the<br/>\nneighbor does.  Most times, I am able to come up with a plan that keeps<br/>\nthings running smoothly.
