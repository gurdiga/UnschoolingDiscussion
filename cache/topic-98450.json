Don&#39;t eat too many<br/>\nat once or you will have the opposite problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally though, I think all you can really do is explain to her about the<br/>\nconnection between fiber and comfort, and continue looking for a fresh fruit<br/>\nthat she likes, or a cereal, or maybe a Metamucil type product in a<br/>\nsmoothie?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have told Jayn, fairly simplistically, that fruit helps makes her poop<br/>\ncome out easily. I have found that if she ever has a movement that is pebble<br/>\nlike, she will look at it and say she needs to eat some fruit.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When Jayn goes to other&#39;&#39;s houses, do you tell her that other people<br/>\nhave different rules and she has to listen to those rules?  (i.e. at home<br/>\nshe can jump on the couch but at so-and-so&#39;s house she can&#39;t do that)  I ask<br/>\nbecause I wonder if this idea couldn&#39;t work the same with your two visitors,<br/>\nespecially if their mom isn&#39;t there... &lt;BEG&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, we don&#39;t have rules, at least we don&#39;t ever express our requests to<br/>\nJayn in those terms. I guess we have a few &quot;habitual behaviors&quot; that we<br/>\npretty much always ask of Jayn, such as to wait for one of us to go down to<br/>\nthe pool with her, even if there is someone already swimming. Speaking to<br/>\nother visitors to our home in terms of &quot;our house rules&quot; would feel<br/>\nhypocritical to me, even though I am sure that other kids have a greater<br/>\nunderstanding of what the word means than Jayn does. I usually say more like<br/>\n&quot;I prefer you to....&quot; or &quot;That could be dangerous/disturbing to someone...&quot;<br/>\nor &quot;Those things are not available today&quot; (for some toy that is put up).<br/>\n<br/>\nI must say that the vast majority of homes that we go to have a free and lax<br/>\nattitude towards stuff like jumping on sofas, and mostly rules are<br/>\ninvisible. However there are places we go to where behavior standards are<br/>\ndifferent, usually public places. When forbidding and grumpy docents express<br/>\nthemselves in terms of &quot;It&#39;s The Rule Here&quot;, evidently expecting a reaction<br/>\nof instant compliance because of that word, I find Jayn kind of looks at<br/>\nthem with a &quot;What&#39;s up your ass?&quot; expression (possibly one of Sandra&#39;s<br/>\ncobs). I translate for her into our more gentle language. For example: &quot;They<br/>\ndon&#39;t want people to run in here because they are afraid people might fall<br/>\nor run into each other or things and get hurt&quot;; &quot;They want everyone to keep<br/>\ntheir socks on because it is more hygienic&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we visit someone&#39;s home Jayn generally takes her cue from the host<br/>\nchildren. It has been a really long time since we have been to a home when<br/>\nsomeone had some kind of stated rule. It was &quot;No food in the schoolroom&quot; (I<br/>\nthink you can see instantly why we have not ended up in a close ongoing<br/>\nrelationship with that family). I&#39;m afraid I was the person who didn&#39;t<br/>\nrealize that it was a &quot;RULE&quot; and that was why the little girl (they were<br/>\nboth just 2 at the time) was getting distressed. Also we had been to a party<br/>\nwhen the kids specifically ate in the schoolroom set up for the purpose, so<br/>\nI was confused.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I don&#39;t express anything to Jayn with the words, &quot;Their rule is...&quot;<br/>\nInstead I say, &quot;So-and-so doesn&#39;t want you to ....&quot; Jayn will often ask<br/>\nquestions about why if someone makes a sweeping statement like &quot;We don&#39;t<br/>\n....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
