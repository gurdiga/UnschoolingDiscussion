Why?  Sounds like you&#39;re not having any fun with your kids.<br/>\nPerhaps you need an &quot;adult only&quot; break, or time for yourself that is not<br/>\nchild-centered.  Are your children very young?<br/>\n<br/>\nI only have 3 kids, and one is a toddler who is VERY active, very verbal,<br/>\nand very curious and doesn&#39;t sleep very much.  Some days I&#39;m REALLY, REALLY<br/>\ntired.  When I get grouchy, at my wits end, then I know we HAVE to do<br/>\nsomething fun, relaxing.  A change of pace helps me a lot.  Also, talking<br/>\nwith my older kids, (if I feel they are not helping out enough and if that<br/>\nis adding to my stress)... asking them to be a bit more helpful because I&#39;m<br/>\nfeeling kind of tired and grouchy.  They are always so surprised that I have<br/>\nbad days, too! They go out of their way to do something nice for me (set the<br/>\ntable without asking, extra hugs, etc...)<br/>\n<br/>\nEverybody has bad days.  Are you doing too much?  Do you have a spouse who<br/>\nbacks you up in regards to unschooling?  In the beginning, my husband was<br/>\nnot so sure that what we were doing was beneficial.  As time went on, he<br/>\ncame around.  Those early months were tough for me personally.  I felt so<br/>\nraw, so misunderstood.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you should quit -- not unschooling, but rather rethink what you ARE<br/>\ndoing.  Change how the day unfolds for yourself and enlist your family&#39;s<br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet out the baby books (or old photos, etc...) and &quot;see&quot; how things HAVE<br/>\nchanged, how your kids have grown, learned, etc...  Sometimes I also lose<br/>\nsight of the &quot;big picture,&quot; and concentrate on the relentless, annoying,<br/>\nsmall things that bug the heck out of me.<br/>\n<br/>\nRebeca</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92906,"nextTopicId":92920}}
