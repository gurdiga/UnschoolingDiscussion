He <br/>\nis now almost 8 and has not been done since. However he gets verys  sick <br/>\nfrequently, not able to fight viruses etc., and after doing some reading, I <br/>\nbelieve this is linked to being vaccinated. My daughter is  2, was never vacc&#39;ed and <br/>\nhas had 3 colds in her life, that is it!!! She is happy, healthy and I <br/>\nbelieve that is due in part to not being done. Both children were exclusiviely <br/>\nbreastfed, my son till 5.5 years old, my dd is still a nursing fiend.
