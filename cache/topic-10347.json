As <br/>\nI grew up, I became Pepsi&#39;s #1 fan.  :)  I also have always been  the type of <br/>\nperson who gets nervous easily, and as I grew up became more phobic about <br/>\nthings.  I would worry about things excessively, and fear things needlessly.  <br/>\nPregnancy made things enhanced the first time around... I had a sense of <br/>\ndepression throughout the pregnancy, which lifted almost immediately at <br/>\ndelivery.  The next time around, the digestion trouble started in conjunction <br/>\nwith eating corn, or with corn as an ingredient, and sometimes dairy.  The <br/>\ngas was painful.  When I was a teen, the allergy symptoms started, which <br/>\nseemed like seasonal allergies-- hayfever, itchy red eyes, sneezing.  In my <br/>\n20&#39;s I began getting headaches which made me feel sick.  I left work a few <br/>\ntimes feeling so bad-- I&#39;d go home, get sick, and go to bed-- to wake up <br/>\nlater feeling fine.  The headaches got so much worse during pregnancy the <br/>\nfirst time around, so when I got pregnant again, the doc had me go on a diet <br/>\nto eliminate foods that triggered migraines.  It was here I began noticing <br/>\nthat what I ate affected how I felt. After my second pregnancy, what seemed <br/>\nlike post partum symptoms kept getting worse, as the months went by.  I began <br/>\nhaving more anxiety and worry, and by the time the baby was 7 mos I had had <br/>\nenough.  I was having a terrible time  digesting some foods, but was unsure <br/>\nexactly what was setting it all off.  I once thought I was having <br/>\nappendicitis, b/c of the pain; then it felt like my gall bladder was acting <br/>\nup, then it seemed like I might have an ulcer.  I was also having a lot of <br/>\ntrouble sleeping at night, so I was feeling a lot of fatigue, which fueled <br/>\nmore worrying.  As it turns out, white flour products such as white bread, <br/>\nand other refined foods are a part of the problem.  Eating fruits that have a <br/>\nhigh natural level of sugar are also a problem for me, as are starchy <br/>\ncarbohydrates, such as potatoes and corn.  I have cut out all refined sugars, <br/>\nwhite flour products, potatoes and corn from my diet at this time.  I do <br/>\nstill eat dairy products, but use  lactose supplements, which has made a <br/>\ntremendous difference.  I eat whole wheat flour or oat flour bread products, <br/>\nlike pancakes and tortillas.  I use a low glycemic sweetener called &quot;Sweet <br/>\nBalance&quot; in my cooking, as it is proven not to affect blood sugar levels.    <br/>\nIn addition, I take a multi-vitamin (my Prenatal, as my baby is still <br/>\nnursing), and a B-complex and calcium supplement.  The goal is to keep the <br/>\nblood sugar level in check, so I eat a snack usually every couple of hours, <br/>\nand before bed I eat yogurt or have a homemade yogurt shake.  The b-complex <br/>\nhelps  to stabilize the nervous system, which is hit the hardest when blood <br/>\nsugar levels are out of balance, and the calcium supp. and snack before bed <br/>\nis to help keep the level in check during the night, which will help me sleep <br/>\nbetter, and helps prevent muscle cramps, which occur when blood sugar levels <br/>\ndrop off.   I would be happy to talk further with you if you would like to.  <br/>\n:)  Take care.  ~Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10345,"nextTopicId":10348}}
