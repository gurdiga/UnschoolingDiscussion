I&#39;ve been at the threshold of that <br/>\nhappening, when I had it done the first time about ten years ago. And <br/>\nnow am having it done again, because there are a few places in my gum <br/>\nline where the gum has separated. This produces pockets, where...oh, <br/>\nthis really is GROSS...well, bacteria gather, plaque, tartar, damage. <br/>\nPlaning takes the tartar off, so the gum can heal and adhere to the <br/>\ntooth again.
