My name is Annette. I am married to my<br/>\nwonderful husband and father to our children Don for<br/>\nthe past 18 years. Our kids are 16 yo Ian, 14 yo<br/>\nHannah, 10 year old Molly and 22 month old Laurel. I<br/>\nam a long time home schooler with this being my 11th<br/>\nyear. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy two oldest kids chose to try school out. My son was<br/>\nthere for 3 years from 8th grade though his sophomore<br/>\nyear. He is now back home and working toward early<br/>\ngraduation at the end of this year. <br/>\n<br/>\nHannah (my 14 yo) went to school in the 6th grade and<br/>\nhas continued on there. She is in a wonderful school<br/>\n(as far as public schools go) out in the country that<br/>\ndoes a lot of hands on, interesting, living educating<br/>\nof the children there. <br/>\n<br/>\nMolly (my 10 yo) is severely (diagnosed) dyslexic.<br/>\nThat has been a long road for the both of us. She is a<br/>\nwonderful child, with a brilliant, creative mind. She<br/>\nloves art of all types and spends as much time as she<br/>\ncan squeeze out of each day either painting, drawing,<br/>\nor sculpting. She also loves sports and plays on<br/>\nseveral rec league teams throughout the year. She was<br/>\na team gymnast for awhile, but opted out when the goal<br/>\nof perfection became more of a pressure than fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaurel just bobs along hanging out with all of us at<br/>\nvarious times. She keeps life full of fun. It is so<br/>\nwonderful having a little one in the house again. Will<br/>\nI ever get my fill of babies and toddlers?! I think we<br/>\nare at the point now where we will have to wait for<br/>\ngrandkids if we want any more babies running through<br/>\nour house. :o) But you never know!<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to reading everyone&#39;s posts and getting<br/>\nto know all of you to some degree. I understand this<br/>\nis a large, high volume, list. I hope I can keep up!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings and peace upon this New Year for us all.<br/>\n  Annette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
