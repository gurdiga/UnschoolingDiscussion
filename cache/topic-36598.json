With 5 kids, food is one<br/>\nof our biggest expenses.  When we started &quot;de-dieting&quot;, I was concerned<br/>\nabout the financial issues as well.  Here is how we handle it:<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask the kids, including the little guys what they want to have for suppers<br/>\nand lunches.  Usually, it is pizza (which I make from scratch) or PBJ.  I<br/>\ntry to make a favorite of each child just every few days.  I try to offer at<br/>\nleast one thing that each kid likes each meal.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I go to the store, I ask the kids if there is something special they<br/>\nwant.  Right now, its yogurt and grapefruit.  When we first started, it was<br/>\npoptarts and Pepsi.  I simply try to fit the special things they ask for<br/>\ninto the weekly budget.  Perhaps I buy more hamburger than steak that week<br/>\nor make more things from scratch than convenience foods, but it seems to be<br/>\nworking out and not costing us any more money.  When they have eaten that<br/>\nweek&#39;s groceries, they have eaten that week&#39;s groceries.  They know I will<br/>\nbuy more of whatever they want the next week.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went through a period where we couldn&#39;t keep enough chocolate pudding in<br/>\nthe house, now no one eats it much.  Today for lunch, the kids could had<br/>\nready access to ice cream, pudding, chocolate chips, etc., Zach (8) made<br/>\nhimself some tomato soup and a yogurt.  Adriane (11) made a grilled cheese<br/>\nsandwich and a glass of milk.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36617,"nextTopicId":36597}}
