Not Captain Underpants, though I  <br/>\nreally like those and they&#39;re well done.   It would be picture books,  <br/>\nor the time I remember best was when I checked out The Complete Works  <br/>\nof Edgar Allen Poe and On Beyond Zebra, by Dr. Seuss, at the same  <br/>\ntime, when I was 13 / 8th grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t brave enough to go into a long defense, so I told my  <br/>\ndetractors I was going to be a teacher so I needed to be up on  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s literature.   They settled for that, and it was true, but  <br/>\nwhat I didn&#39;t know how to tell them was that I got it for ME, because  <br/>\nI liked the art, because I liked the way he would make up words to  <br/>\nget a rhyme or rhythm in the poetry, and that I had a &quot;collect the  <br/>\nwhole set&quot; mentality and once I&#39;d read half his stuff I felt  <br/>\ncompelled to read the other half.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the reason I remember this is that the Poe book disappeared,  <br/>\nand I couldn&#39;t find it, and had to pay for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen my friend Charles Montoya shot himself.  Much trauma in all my  <br/>\nsocial groups; his dad was our art teacher; much trauma.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few weeks later, his dad brought me the Edgar Allen Poe book, which  <br/>\nhad been in Charles&#39; stuff, but had some of my papers in it.  I took  <br/>\nit to the library and instead of getting a refund, wrote a dedication  <br/>\nto Charles inside it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, as a kid, nearly every book had a big story.  I used to buy  <br/>\nDoc Savage books with my allowance.  Those I didn&#39;t take to school,  <br/>\nbecause not only would they have probably been confiscated, people  <br/>\nwould have teased me because they were &quot;boys&#39; books.&quot;   I remember  <br/>\nthem not for the stories, but because the books cost 50 cents, and my  <br/>\nallowance was 35 cents, so my range to spend in the first week was  <br/>\nonly five or ten cents, if I wanted to be able to afford my book for  <br/>\nsure the next week.    That was shortly before the crazy inflation of  <br/>\nthe 70&#39;s.  We could still get candy bars for a nickel (5 cents: note  <br/>\nfor Brits) or a dime (Almond Joy and Mounds were the only ten cent  <br/>\ncandy bars).  Bubble Gum was honestly a penny.   But I bought books  <br/>\ninstead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere just weren&#39;t books at my house, and that&#39;s why, for me, school  <br/>\nand the library seemed like fairy land.  I&#39;ve often looked back and  <br/>\nthought I liked school, so school must&#39;ve been good, but it was good  <br/>\nin comparison to home, in several ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Marty came home for lunch and was watching the Tony Danza  <br/>\nshow.  They showed a school in Los Angeles they called &quot;the homeless  <br/>\nschool,&quot; and were talking to some of the kids and teachers.  They  <br/>\nsaid for some of those kids, school was the only safe part of their  <br/>\nlives, the only fun part, and I knew that feeling.   (My house was  <br/>\nsafe enough, but not as safe as my own children&#39;s house is.  My  <br/>\nyounger cousin was unpredictable and hit us sometimes, and molested  <br/>\nmy sister, though I didn&#39;t know until a few years later, and we were  <br/>\nspanked and yelled at, but we had the possibility of privacy, at  <br/>\nleast, which the homeless kids seemed to lack.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when people are considering whether they want to unschool  <br/>\nthey&#39;re going on and on with questions about whether it will be  <br/>\nperfect, whether it will be utopia.  They forget to ask whether it  <br/>\nwill be better than school, and whether it will be better than buying  <br/>\nand trying to enforce a school in a box.  And this isn&#39;t to say I  <br/>\nthink they should settle for &quot;just better,&quot; but that IS the initial  <br/>\nquestion:  What are your options, and what do you want out of this?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids don&#39;t have to worry about watching The Borrowers or Follow  <br/>\nthat Bird and Pulp Fiction (Doc Savage reminded me of that &lt;g&gt;) or a  <br/>\nJet Li movie or  Tombstone on the same day.  Marty&#39;s reading American  <br/>\nGods and Batman comics.  The book goes with him when he has to wait  <br/>\nin a reception area.  He&#39;s not in a hurry to finish it, because he  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t deadline trained.  His mind is devoid of &quot;semester&quot; or &quot;unit&quot;  <br/>\nor &quot;book report.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":239750918,"authorName":"Heather Woodward","from":"&quot;Heather Woodward&quot; &lt;bacwoodz@...&gt;","profile":"bacwoodz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] What do your kids do?/Literature","postDate":"1139274789","msgId":111801,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTgwMWM2MmI4MyRhOGJlYmIyMCQwMTAwYThjMEBoZWF0aGVybmo4cGVuMj4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwMjA2MTUzMjI2LjY3Njc3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxMTAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPiA8Nzk1RDk2ODMtRTM5My00NDNELUE5RjMtMzAyQjFEQjNERjI2QHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":111807,"prevInTime":111800,"nextInTime":111802,"topicId":111801,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We are currently listening to A Tale of Two<br/>\nCities on Audiobook. She also has been known to get Captain Underpants. I<br/>\nthink what is funny is that she doesn&#39;t have that differentiation of this is<br/>\na &quot;classic&quot; and this Captain Underpants is not. To her they are all just<br/>\nbooks. Some are older and have more difficult language. Often she will ask<br/>\nwhat a word means and I don&#39;t know so we&#39;ll look it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was supposed to read a lot of these books throughout high school - but I<br/>\nwas busy reading Stephen King. I did the cliff notes - and read the least<br/>\nbit possible until I could be done. Now I am enjoying them. Even my husband<br/>\n, who hated school and still barely reads for fun, will listen to something<br/>\nthat we have left in the car and really enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so glad that my daughter doesn&#39;t have the issues from school with<br/>\nregard to literature. She reads them because she has heard them alluded to<br/>\nin movies, or another book. Some she doesn&#39;t like and takes back without<br/>\nreading them and some she really likes. She also likes to cook and will<br/>\noften come home with a pile of cookbooks. She made homeade pasta the other<br/>\nnight for dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is funny is that the library has a Homeschooling Book Discussion Group<br/>\nand last year, she went and enjoyed it. This year she hasn&#39;t seemed to like<br/>\nthe book choices and so has not attended. If I had made her read certain<br/>\nbooks because the curriculum said she needed to read them NOW, she would<br/>\nprobably hate them - and learn to avoid anything labeled a &quot;classic&quot; as<br/>\nboring and schoolish.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - the joys of Unschooling!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111824,"nextTopicId":111841}}
