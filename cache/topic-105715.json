Unless of course<br/>\nyou are an information hound and just love the intellectual banter that the<br/>\ndiscussion of theories takes on.  Like I said in my earlier email, I have<br/>\nraised my three kids with TCS tenets, although never knew there was a theory<br/>\nor a label for my approach.

Aside from that, I too find (as a few other posts have<br/>\nmentioned) the TCS discussion lists cumbersome and much too bogged down with<br/>\nsemantics.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarb<br/>\n<br/>\nE-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:barb.lundgren@...\">barb.lundgren@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it.
