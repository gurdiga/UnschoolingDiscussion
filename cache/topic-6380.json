I am NO<br/>\nexpert on this, but at the farm where we are living, the first cheeses<br/>\nmade were soft unripened ones that are very simple and very good.<br/>\nSimply scald (NOT BOIL) a litre of goat milk, then add about 2<br/>\ntablespoons of vinegar (I&#39;ve also tried organic lemon juice, but used<br/>\nslightly more) after you remove it from the heat.  Stir, and it will<br/>\nstart to curdle.  Let it sit for a bit, then pour through some cheese<br/>\ncloth in a colander and hang or press to get the whey out.  Before<br/>\npressing or hanging you can add a little salt. Presto.  We have mixed<br/>\nthis simple and quick cheese with herbs (basil is wonderful), garlic,<br/>\nsmoked salmon, sun-dried tomatoes, etc. with great success.  This is<br/>\nreally a delicious but simple and versatile cheese.  The whey is used in<br/>\nbreads and soups, etc.  We also freeze milk for the dry times.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cheese I just made was a more traditional one with bacterial<br/>\nculture, and rennet, and is a bit more complicated.  It is the first<br/>\ntime we&#39;ve done that here, but it is going to be a growing venture.<br/>\nThere is a fair bit of information on the web -- I didn&#39;t bookmark the<br/>\nsite, but I had good luck just enterring &#39;goat cheese&#39; and browsing.  We<br/>\nalso get cheese books from the library -- it&#39;s is pretty much the same<br/>\nprocess as for cow cheese.  You need to order culture and rennet,<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we are all allergic to dairy, we use goat milk for everyting.<br/>\nWe make puddings (a thickener such as corn starch, arrowroot, tapioca or<br/>\nflour; vanilla and honey) to eat with fruit, or to make pies.  The kids<br/>\nlove these.  One day Jorlene, the real goat lady here, dried some of the<br/>\nunripened cheese in a pan in the oven, turning often, to yield a dried<br/>\ncheese comparable to parmesan.  Very good, and uses quite a bit of milk.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all I&#39;ve got ...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina in B.C., Canada.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6295,"nextTopicId":6382}}
