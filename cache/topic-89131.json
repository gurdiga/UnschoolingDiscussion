I also have a 16-y-o son, who <br/>\nafter leaving school 2 1/2 years ago, spent quite a bit of <br/>\ntime &quot;doing nothing.&quot;  So, from that base of experience, I have a <br/>\ncouple of suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet a job, even if it&#39;s not in your field of interest.  Earning money <br/>\nwill enable you to expand your world--by getting a car, license, <br/>\ninsurance; by funding workshops, book purchases, computer stuff, <br/>\nclasses, conferences, camps; by funding memberships (DVD clubs like <br/>\nNetflicks or Mentura), subscriptions, etc.  Running your own computer <br/>\nassistance business might work in a town like yours.  Put an ad on <br/>\nthe local bulletin board and in the local shopper.  Other self-<br/>\nemployment ideas: house cleaning, yard work, childcare, snow <br/>\nshoveling, cleaning gutters, painting.  It can feel good to work--<br/>\ngets your energy going. <br/>\n<br/>\nChallenge yourself to ask questions when you watch a movie or read a <br/>\nbook.  Write them down.  Pursue answers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAsk the library that&#39;s closest to you to get titles you want, either <br/>\non interlibrary loan, or by purchasing them. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome books my son has enjoyed recently: <br/>\nThe Simpsons and Philosphy: the D&#39;oh! of Homer. eds: Irwin, Conard, & <br/>\nSkoble<br/>\nRich Dad, Poor Dad, by Robert T. Kiyosaki & Sharon L. Lechter (about <br/>\nfinancial intelligence; the authors note that schools do nothing to <br/>\npromote financial intelligence, but merely repeat the &quot;stay in <br/>\nschool, get good grades, get a degree, so you can get a good job&quot; <br/>\nline, which, the authors say, isn&#39;t true and doesn&#39;t teach money <br/>\nmanagement at all)<br/>\nKnowing God, by J.I. Packer<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re interested in philosophy, my husband recommends:<br/>\n<br/>\nPatterns of the Western Mind, by John Kok  --long ordering time from <br/>\nAmazon, quicker at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dordt.edu/bookstore/\">http://www.dordt.edu/bookstore/</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nI encourage you to get to know some people better in that small town <br/>\nof yours.  You write well.  Have you thought about putting together a <br/>\nhistory of your town, or a collection of stories from its <br/>\ninhabitants?  Start with some of the oldest people there.  How has <br/>\nlife changed?  How is it the same?

(Both of my<br/>\nparents didn&#39;t like the idea, but they didn&#39;t really get in my way<br/>\nthat much. I can be very stubborn and strong willed when I set my mind<br/>\non something. =P) After skipping school on and off for about two<br/>\nmonths, the school threatened to send my parents to court, and so I<br/>\nwent back to school. It wasn&#39;t fun at all, (I would get detention for<br/>\nreading books in class instead of &quot;learning&quot;, and then get sent to<br/>\nalternative schools for reading in detention. =P), but I stayed in<br/>\nschool until I turned 16, then rose out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been out of school for about a little over half a year now.
