I go as often as<br/>\nmy schedule allows, I try to go 2x/wk. Luckily he&#39;s a friend of ours, so he<br/>\nallows me to be flexible with my visits. I think the advantages of<br/>\nchiropractic care are enourmous. I try to go even when I&#39;m not in pain, so<br/>\nthat I can still receive the benefits of a better immune system, etc. My<br/>\nchildren have all been adjusted from time to time also. He confirms what has<br/>\nalready been stated here, that simply being born is one of the most<br/>\ntraumatic things that can happen to the spinal cord. I would encorage<br/>\neveryone, child or adult, in pain or not to visit a chiropractor. IMO it can<br/>\nonly make things better.<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7998,"nextTopicId":8004}}
