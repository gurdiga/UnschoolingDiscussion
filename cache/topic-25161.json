It <br/>\nis still not even unpacked and we have several painting jobs ongoing. The <br/>\nmess was starting to bother me and everyone else. We had done this chart <br/>\nbefore and decided (all of us) to do it again. We wrote all the jobs down <br/>\nthat anyone could think of and separated them into weekly, monthly, <br/>\nquarterly. Then we each got to pick out the ones we wanted or in some cases <br/>\nsettled for. Then we made a chart showing who does what, and decided to <br/>\nrotate jobs every month, making no one stuck with something they don&#39;t want <br/>\nto do. If someone doesn&#39;t want to do the daily stuff, no big deal . . . even <br/>\nthe weekly. . . its a guideline, but everyone is happy about it, and feels <br/>\nbetter about the house. No one did their daily stuff today cause we were all <br/>\nbusy, and that&#39;s fine. And we feel free to ask somone else for help or even <br/>\nto do our job if we cant get to it and it needs doing. . . its real flexible <br/>\nbut its a great guidline for us all and it helps us to get focused when we <br/>\nfeel like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25060,"nextTopicId":25218}}
