(None<br/>\nof them go to school)  If he were in school he would<br/>\nbe labeled ADD or ADHD.  Which is one of the many<br/>\nreasons he is home with me.  My son has some anger<br/>\nissues so sometimes he has a melt down not very often.<br/>\n But he had one the other night and my husband<br/>\nsuggested medication.  We have been down this road<br/>\nwith my 19year old who was on Ritalin for 5 years and<br/>\nit turned him into a zombie.  My husband has said we<br/>\nshould try something else, or maybe it is his diet of<br/>\nbiscuits, bacon, pizza, and chips. (He is less needy<br/>\nwhen he picks out those items he wishes to eat and<br/>\ndoes not show any negativity or aggressive behavior<br/>\nafter eating, I totally can relate to everything Ren<br/>\nsaid about food).  These things must be causing his<br/>\nanger.  Of course it has nothing to do with the fact<br/>\nthat my husband is only home late in the evening and<br/>\non the weekends and when he is home he either watches<br/>\nTV or parents by control.  Also since my son has been<br/>\nborn, we have moved three times and my husband has<br/>\nlost his job 5 times.  As the youngest he also has<br/>\nmore than 2 parents his brothers and sister tend to<br/>\nparent.  But of course  NONE of those things have<br/>\nanything to do with it.

Of course we have had our <br/>\nshare, maybe more so of trying times but she is doing great now. I do enjoy <br/>\nhaving her around as the whole family does. The baby screams &quot;Tara&#39;s home&quot; <br/>\nwhenever she hears the key in the door at 3:00 and goes running. Tara went <br/>\non a week long cruise with friends before school started and we all missed <br/>\nher terrribly. The first night I just envisioned she was at a friends house <br/>\nbut the second night was reality. I couldn&#39;t wait for her to get home and <br/>\nwhen she came home she hugged me so tight I thought I would burst. She made <br/>\nme promise to never leave  her again. (I wasn&#39;t the one that left!!!) She <br/>\nsaid she was very homesick and although she had fun, she wouldn&#39;t do it <br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s the school kid in the family but I try very hard to raise her with the <br/>\nunschooling values. (still learning) She attends many functions with our <br/>\nhomeschooling group by her choice and I never say no, you have to go to <br/>\nschool. I have had many compliments on her behavior, willingness to help and <br/>\ntolerance with all the kids. I&#39;ve had mom&#39;s who have daughters ask me how it <br/>\nis that we seem so close and always seem to enjoy each other so much. It&#39;s <br/>\nbecause we just do!!! They even have gone as far as to say they hope when <br/>\ntheir daughter reaches that age, they will be like her and I are.
