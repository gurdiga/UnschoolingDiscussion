If<br/>\nsomeone says they&#39;ve taken off their swimmies and has let go of the side,<br/>\nthe only apparent outcome for them it seems is drowning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we take away school, it seems like we&#39;re left with nothing between birth<br/>\nand college or job.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis site is about what fills that hole left by school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe amazing thing is that once you get school out of life, you realize that<br/>\nschool wasn&#39;t a natural part of life and didn&#39;t leave a hole.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is like a stack of dry books on ³all the stuff it¹s important to<br/>\nknow² in a windowless room. When people first hear of unschooling, it sounds<br/>\nlike we&#39;re removing the dry books and leaving kids in a windowless room. But<br/>\nwe&#39;re removing the windowless room to let kids see they&#39;re in the middle of<br/>\na vast library full of wonderful media to explore. They could look at the<br/>\ndry books, but they probably won&#39;t because they have much more interesting<br/>\nways of exploring the same things.<br/>\n<br/>\n**I just fear they won&#39;t learn enough to get by.**<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is like a grocery store. It&#39;s everything you might need to cook with.<br/>\nAnd what schools do is spend 12 years cramming the entire grocery store into<br/>\nkids so they can be prepared to cook anything they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut how much of the grocery store do you ever use?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about browsing the grocery store, learning about what&#39;s<br/>\navailable, having access to recipes and cookbooks and cooking shows, but<br/>\ntaking home just the stuff that you&#39;ll actually use and eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn unschooling life is about browsing the world, seeking out things that<br/>\nlook intriguing. Looking closer at what interests them. And delving into<br/>\nwhat they find themselves passionate about.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one needs the whole grocery store. They just need to be able to find what<br/>\nthey need when they need it.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Colleges are very picky now, and employers only want to hire the best.**<br/>\n<br/>\nStandard American dream is success leads to happiness. Success is usually<br/>\ndefined as a high paying job that allows someone to purchase the &quot;good life&quot;<br/>\nfor their families. And to get that high paying job you need to go to a<br/>\nreally good college. And to get into that really good college you need to<br/>\nget good grades in high school.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about replacing that with something *better*.<br/>\n<br/>\n**My oldest son who is in high school would think I was nuts if I said let&#39;s<br/>\njust learn through life and not worry about college or the future.**<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, he would. As would most people who¹ve been through school or are in<br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone can see every single day that the sun obviously goes around the<br/>\nearth. Anyone who says otherwise is nuts. So if someone thinks they already<br/>\nknow what is true, anything outside that truth is going to sound false.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone knows there are only two options: stay in school or be a drop<br/>\nout, then anything other than school sounds nuts.<br/>\n<br/>\n**I was always taught to train them for a higher goal including reaching for<br/>\nthe best financially or otherwise.**<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, standard American dream. But how does it turn out in truth?<br/>\n<br/>\nStandard thought is that school prepares kids for life. But how many kids is<br/>\nthat true for? We *want* to believe it¹s true. We focus on the kids who<br/>\nappear to be models of success. We find ways of explaining the failures of<br/>\nschool -- with reasons that point to causes other than school like<br/>\nunmotivated kids and uncaring parents and bad environment that school can¹t<br/>\ncompensate for.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in general -- not in every case, but in general -- people find success<br/>\nto be an elusive goal and the happiness that was promised with it never<br/>\nquite there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf pursuing the American Dream led to happiness, then everyone who set out<br/>\non the path to pursue it would be happy. But they aren¹t. And some people<br/>\nwho reject the American Dream are happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince pursuing the American Dream isn¹t a guarantee and some people find<br/>\nhappiness without pursuing the American Dream, there¹s some other factor<br/>\ninvolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat other factor is what unschooling is about. It dispenses with the false<br/>\nhopes dangled by the American Dream and focuses on joy being the goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n**My oldest son has always been free to explore life but he has always had<br/>\nrules to live by. Not too strict, but still rules.**<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son is in school, his freedom to explore life is severely limited.<br/>\nIf he can¹t do whatever he wants whenever he wants for as long as he wants<br/>\n-- free from messages that what he¹s choosing isn¹t as good as what¹s done<br/>\nin school -- then he isn¹t truly free.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he¹s convinced that school is the best path to be on and that doing<br/>\nhomework is better than reading the ³fluff² he enjoys, then he doesn¹t have<br/>\ntrue freedom. He is confined by false beliefs that are as secure as iron<br/>\nbars. But they¹re invisible so he doesn¹t even realize he¹s confined.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has had true freedom and no rules and she¹s a great kid. So<br/>\nthere¹s some factor other than rules that creates great kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n**I just can&#39;t wrap my mind around how they will be prepared for college and<br/>\nemployment.**<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can¹t imagine it because it isn¹t in your experience. Reading here will<br/>\nhelp you fill the vacuum that¹s left behind by school.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as finding out about the structure of the solar system will help<br/>\nsomeone reconcile what they they see with what is really true.<br/>\n<br/>\n**I guess part of me is still trained to feel that doing well in school is<br/>\nthe only way to get ahead in life.**<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, yeah. If someone could get to a similar place that school takes them<br/>\njust by living life, why would anyone stay in school?<br/>\n<br/>\n**I want my boys to have the best of both worlds, free to explore life but<br/>\nstill having all the education they need to get ahead in life. Did you ever<br/>\nfeel so torn about your decision or did you just know it was right?**<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn¹t until I realized that unschooling offered something *better* than<br/>\nthe standard path to (supposed) success that I finally understood what<br/>\nunschooling was all about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could tell you that unschooling is about happiness and joy and pursuing<br/>\npassions, but at this point I suspect you¹d dismiss it as pie in the sky. I<br/>\nwould have.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat made me stick with investigating unschooling was the belief that there<br/>\nhad to be more interesting ways to learn than how school went about it. Life<br/>\nwas interesting to me and I wanted to know more. But school only offered<br/>\ndull ways of learning about interesting things. I did well in school, but it<br/>\nfelt unsatisfying.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first started out investigating homeschooling, I read posts from<br/>\npeople all along the spectrum of homeschooling. All the homeschoolers<br/>\npursuing more schoolish methods were rarely having fun. Most of their posts<br/>\nwere about how to get their kids to do their work, or how to handle more<br/>\ngrades than one, or what are the best resources. But the unschoolers were<br/>\nliving joyful lives while they learned. And since my daughter was only 4,<br/>\nany concerns I had about algebra could wait for several years.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I got unschooling, I thought the best I could offer my daughter was<br/>\nto prepare her so she could go to MIT if she wanted. But sticking with<br/>\nunschooling for the early years allowed me time to realize that it&#39;s better<br/>\nto help her be who she is so that if she were someone who wanted what MIT<br/>\noffered, she¹d naturally be heading in that direction pursuing interesting<br/>\nthings that would make MIT a viable option for her. (As it is, she¹s<br/>\npursuing writing and drawing with a passion.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93220,"nextTopicId":93236}}
