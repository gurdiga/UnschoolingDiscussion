Now he says he may grow it longer and <br/>\nwait till it is really long to donate it.  I think part of that is because <br/>\nhis dad and other people give him a hard time about it and now it is just to <br/>\nbuck the system so to say.  I love his long her, if I get a chance I will <br/>\nfind a picture to send.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":65172662,"authorName":"The White&#39;s","from":"&quot;The White&#39;s&quot; &lt;jwwjr@...&gt;","profile":"whitehouseacademy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"was bi-racial kids, now long hair","postDate":"1038233017","msgId":50747,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjUwMWMyOTQ4YiQ3Mzk3ZmEyMCQyMjIyZTRjZUBiYjN0aDAxPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":50758,"prevInTime":50746,"nextInTime":50748,"topicId":50747,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated: Sun, 24 Nov 2002 13:55:03 Wendy  writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-922399564\">In a message dated: Sun, 24 Nov 2002 13:55:03 <br/>\n  &quot;Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:owlinden@...\">owlinden@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;That is so true. I think the other thing for me is being in a military town where most of the little boys have a barbershop buzz.  I personally don&#39;t like it. Just another way to buck the system, I suppose.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe when he&#39;s two I&#39;ll give it a little trim.<br/>\n  Maybe not....&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDillon will be 10 next week and decided earlier this year to let his hair grow out.  It&#39;s fine with me too.  I did have him trim his hair some in August because he was an usher in a friend&#39;s wedding and his hair was at that really shaggy stage. After the rehearsal his comment was something like &quot;I&#39;m the only one who has any hair&quot;.  We&#39;re very rural here and the look is almost shaved bald with just a bit more on the top.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I get those comments, or he does, from my sister or friends or even strangers, I just tell them that it&#39;s his hair.  He&#39;s free to do with it what he wishes.  I have asked that he keep it clean and combed, and he agreed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for first haircuts.....my dh got tired of people thinking Dillon was a girl, so we had his hair cut when he was about 2.  WOW!  Went together to the barber, took the video camera, kept hair, etc.  The wow part is how totally different he looked when done....kinda like when your dh comes home clean shaven when he&#39;s had a beard for years.  But he did look like a little boy when it was done. <br/>\n<br/>\nI only cut my long hair off for the first time since I was 8 about 4 yrs ago.  I had always had waist length hair but in the last 5-6 yrs always kept it in a braid down my back.  Dillon still wants me to grow it back!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI like bucking the system too, and even my *closest* friends here don&#39;t really get me.  I guess that&#39;s why I&#39;m thankful for this group :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50748,"nextTopicId":50633}}
