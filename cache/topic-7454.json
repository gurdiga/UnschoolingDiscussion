For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.<br/>\n&gt; 2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; new car.<br/>\n&gt; 3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would<br/>\n&gt; have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut<br/>\noff<br/>\n&gt; the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue. For<br/>\n&gt; some reason you would simply accept this.<br/>\n&gt; 4. Occasionally, executing maneuver such as a left turn would cause your<br/>\ncar<br/>\n&gt; to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to<br/>\nreinstall<br/>\n&gt; the engine.<br/>\n&gt; 5. Only one person at a time could use the car unless you bought &quot;CarNT,&quot;<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; then you would have to buy more seats.<br/>\n&gt; 6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable,<br/>\nfive<br/>\n&gt; times as fast and twice as easy to drive - but it would only run on five<br/>\n&gt; percent of the roads.<br/>\n&gt; 7. The oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would all be<br/>\n&gt; replaced by a single &quot;general protection fault&quot; warning light.<br/>\n&gt; 8. New seats would force everyone to have the same sized butt.<br/>\n&gt; 9. The airbag system would ask &quot;are you sure?&quot; before deploying.<br/>\n&gt; 10. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, you car would lock you out and<br/>\n&gt; refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle,<br/>\nturned<br/>\n&gt; the key and grabbed hold of the antenna.<br/>\n&gt; 11. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand<br/>\n&gt; McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need nor<br/>\n&gt; want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the<br/>\ncars<br/>\n&gt; performance to diminish by 50 percent or more. Moreover, GM would become a<br/>\n&gt; target for investigation by the Justice Department.<br/>\n&gt; 12. Every time GM introduced a new car, car buyers would have to learn to<br/>\n&gt; drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the<br/>\nsame<br/>\n&gt; manner as the old car.<br/>\n&gt; 13. You&#39;d have to press the &quot;start&quot; button to turn the engine off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; KIM<br/>\n&gt; ***runs with scissors***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; DON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
