My job was to <br/>\ncreate the product and policy reference manual for the US company but <br/>\nthat ended up being used worldwide at all their consumer affairs <br/>\ndepartments. Let&#39;s say that I had to wrangle with a lot of ethical <br/>\ndilemmas in putting what in truth ended up being an encyclopedia of <br/>\neverything Colgate-Palmolive. Their legal and marketing department <br/>\nalways wanted the information to look like they had no fault or were <br/>\nnot manipulating information to their advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you read the instructions on the box, it says to use a pea-sized dot <br/>\nof toothpaste for brushing. In the commercials, they use at least 3 <br/>\ntimes the amount of toothpaste necessary. So people follow suit and <br/>\nthey make more money because a tube runs out 3 times as fast. With <br/>\nkids, it&#39;s a similar story. Mints and cinnamon makes kids mouth like <br/>\nit&#39;s burning. So they use bubble gum flavors and the like. Problem is <br/>\nthat many kids use too much TP and end up with mottled teeth --caused <br/>\nby the over-consumption of fluoride. They know that it is difficult to <br/>\nstop kids from eating anything that tastes like candy but if it means <br/>\nthat it insures profits, hey! why not?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact is that many water-supplies in this country have fluoride <br/>\nnaturally or added by public health law. Technically we really do not <br/>\nneed fluoride TP in this country --and they know it. But it ensures <br/>\nprofits because people&#39;s ignorance makes them believe that a <br/>\ncosmeceutical like fluoride TP is better than just having a balanced <br/>\ndiet, drinking lots of water and brushing every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just one example. Don&#39;t even get me started with tartar control <br/>\nTP or, even worse, those EVIL whitening TPs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile working there I stumbled upon research suggesting that in Asia, <br/>\nespecially China, given the overall consumption of GREEN TEA (which is <br/>\nvery high in fluoride) tooth decay is not as rampant as in other <br/>\ncountries. This report took me to a meeting where R&D, marketing and <br/>\nlegal people laughed at someone&#39;s quip that &quot;Well, let&#39;s see about <br/>\nthat&quot;.

Yet he IS in control of his own mouth.  As the <br/>\nyoungest, he&#39;s had the benefit of never having to deal with much of <br/>\nmy coercive parenting.  He&#39;s never been forced to do anything with <br/>\nhis own mouth.

I used to tell her <br/>\nto brush so she didn&#39;t get cavities and then she did get cavities.  I <br/>\nnever had cavities myself, so I figured it must have been because I <br/>\nbrushed every day.  My four year old doesn&#39;t brush well and at the <br/>\nlast dentist visit she told me to keep up the good work, and that she <br/>\ncould see that we do a good job of brushing.  (I didn&#39;t tell her the <br/>\ntruth!)  What&#39;s worrying me is that the brushing is getting worse.  <br/>\nI&#39;m kind of feeling like we pushed it before, and that if we push it <br/>\neven more he&#39;ll really end up with a cavity this time.  If I look at <br/>\nit like that, though, his sister brushed and still got cavities and <br/>\nit wasn&#39;t the end of the world.  So if he doesn&#39;t brush and does get <br/>\na few cavities, it&#39;s not the end of the world either.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Eating carrots and apples helps clean teeth.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good idea! <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"Heidi","from":"&quot;Heidi&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Tooth brushing","postDate":"1065453346","msgId":82234,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJsczB2MitlZjA2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNGODE2QUNELjEwMDA4MDdAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":82230,"nextInTopic":82236,"prevInTime":82233,"nextInTime":82235,"topicId":82206,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We get Peelu chewing gum from our food co-op, and the smallness of the piece is PERFECT for me.

It takes awhile, but <br/>\neventually spreads around the room and settles on all surfaces. So if someone in the <br/>\nhouse is sick and uses the toilet those germs will settle on a toothbrush that <br/>\nmight be left out on the sink. Moly and Jack looked at me with *Ewww Gross* <br/>\nlooks on their faces. I got the keys and we went right to the store. We bought <br/>\nnew toothbrushes and those travel caps, and a new cup for them. We put the caps <br/>\non and put the brushes in the cup and put the cup in the medicine cabinet. We <br/>\nuses to leave the cup by the sink.

Once my childhood <br/>\ndentist told my Mom that I had more perfect teeth than someone who had spent <br/>\nthousands on dental care. Until I was sixteen and got my wisdom teeth, my teeth were <br/>\nperfectly straight. When they started to come in they pushed my teeth and I <br/>\nhave one on the bottom row that is crooked now, other than that I had a good <br/>\nmouth. Now as an adult I am more conscientious about brushing. I do it twice a <br/>\nday, sometimes more, and I have three cavities. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEating carrots and apples helps clean teeth.  <br/>\nRinsing with water, using a toothpick, wiping his teeth with a wet <br/>\nwashcloth--there are other ways than pressing a point which might not be <br/>\nworth pressing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n************************************<br/>\nHe might not like toothpaste. That is why I hated to brush as a child. <br/>\nToothpaste burned my mouth. And I have a poor gag reflex, so on top of a burning <br/>\nmouth, I was constantly feeling like I was going to puke. Maybe you could ask him <br/>\nif he doesn&#39;t want to brush because of this. Maybe if he just used the brush <br/>\nand no toothpaste and a little of some mild mouthwash? Maybe his toothbrush is <br/>\ntoo hard? Have you bought him a soft one? Maybe like Sandra suggested he <br/>\ncould get a washcloth nice and warm and rub his teeth and gums, that is what I <br/>\nused when my kids were very little and just started getting teeth. Jack used to <br/>\nswallow the toothpaste and it always made him sick to his stomach. Is your son <br/>\nswallowing the toothpaste? So many things could be happening that are putting <br/>\nhim off.

I can&#39;t<br/>\nsee any bad looking rotting or cavities like I have seen in pictures<br/>\nprocured online. On rare occasions she had bad breath and one of us<br/>\nmentions it as being some food caught and she will brush then. She<br/>\nreally hates pretty much all the toothpastes we have tried, including<br/>\nthe kid&#39;s flavors. She is more likely to brush with plain water when in<br/>\nthe tub. We have a bunch of brushes, electric and otherwise which she<br/>\nnow uses to scrub the tub or her dolls. I let her know when her teeth<br/>\nseem to be yellow with food, and she often will then brush. I tell her<br/>\nthat she is more likely to get cavities and need fillings if she never<br/>\nbrushes, as that seems reasonable, and shown her images that seem to be<br/>\nfascinating to her. I stress that it is especially a good idea if she<br/>\nhas been eating chocolate. I think we were lucky in that she had no<br/>\nteeth at all until 8 days before her first birthday. I also feel good<br/>\nthat we are still nursing. Sometimes I get concerned that her teeth will<br/>\nsuffer, but so far, so good. I model brushing, flossing and tongue<br/>\nscraping because without assiduous effort I have inherited a tendency to<br/>\nbad breath. My dh never suffers from it, and brushes his teeth only<br/>\nonce/day, and flosses if he feels something stuck. He has a crown, but<br/>\nit was from an accident not cavities.

He has decided that he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to brush his teeth anymore.  This has been going on for <br/>\nmonths and is getting worse and worse.  He is brushing his teeth <br/>\nabout once a week at this point.  He always used to just brush at the <br/>\nsame time his brother brushed.  Sometimes his sister and I brushed at <br/>\nthe same time as them too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought maybe he doesn&#39;t like brushing at night (too tired).  So I <br/>\nstarted asking him if he wanted to brush his teeth with me in the <br/>\nmorning.  Nope.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve explained to him about cavities, and about how he can avoid <br/>\ngetting them by brushing.  I tried to get out of him why he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to brush.  At first he told me that his teeth hurt so he didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant me to brush them.  He likes our dentist, so I asked if I should <br/>\nmake an appointment at the dentist to have her check his teeth and <br/>\nclean them.  Since he&#39;s not brushing well, I figured 3 or 4 cleanings <br/>\na year instead of two might be good.  He said yes about the dentist, <br/>\nI made the appointment, and an hour before the appointment he refused <br/>\nto get in the car.  I called and cancelled.  They weren&#39;t happy <br/>\n(Can&#39;t you just make him get in the car?)  Ugh.  I think that maybe <br/>\nhis teeth really didn&#39;t hurt.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had our homeopath talk to him about it.  She explained to him how <br/>\ncandy sometimes gets stuck between his teeth and he has to make sure <br/>\nhe gets it all out.  She told him about battery operated toothbrushes <br/>\nand we went out and bought him one.  He used it two days and that was <br/>\nthe end of that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have about 6 different kinds of toothpaste.  Sesame street <br/>\ntoothpaste, Scooby toothpaste, Tweety toothpaste, Mickey toothpaste, <br/>\nand more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe read a book called, &quot;I know why I brush my teeth&quot;.  He seemed to <br/>\nenjoy the story.  It didn&#39;t change his brushing habits though. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, his brother and sister each lost a tooth and got money for <br/>\ntheir teeth.  He asked if his teeth rot and fall out because he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t brush, then he will get money too.  I said no, the tooth <br/>\nfairy doesn&#39;t give money if your teeth fall out because they were <br/>\nrotten.  He understands, no tooth fairy money for rotting out teeth. <br/>\nI somehow don&#39;t think the money for rotten, falling out teeth is the <br/>\nreal reason but just an afterthought. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what he&#39;s holding out for.  Maybe he&#39;s waiting to see if <br/>\nhe really will get cavities if he doesn&#39;t brush?  I don&#39;t know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been about 4 days since he&#39;s brushed.  Tonight he rinsed his <br/>\nmouth out with the kids&#39; act ani-plaque rinse at least.   <br/>\n<br/>\nA few years ago I would have held him down to brush his teeth if he <br/>\nrefused to brush.  I don&#39;t parent like that now, and I really don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to force him to brush.  But I don&#39;t want to see him with serious <br/>\ndental problems either.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?  Would this concern you too?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82559,"nextTopicId":82574}}
