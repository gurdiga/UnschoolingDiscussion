And, something stopped her from being <br/>\nable to get comfortable, night before last. I don&#39;t know if sugar makes kids <br/>\nhyper-active, for sure. But  I can tell you THIS for sure: It made my skin <br/>\ncrawl, when I ate a whole bunch of Smarties while writing a paper in college <br/>\na lifetime ago. The huge amount of sugar that I ate caused a physical effect <br/>\nthat I could feel in my body. I&#39;ve also seen my boy, when he was littler, <br/>\nafter eating a lot of sugar, get more jumpy. Like, flinching and crying when <br/>\nan airplane flew overhead. Not hyper, though. So, maybe the experts need to <br/>\nstudy jumpiness, not hyperactivity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-=-I told her all of this, and said &quot;If<br/>\n&gt;you eat sugary things this late  at night, you&#39;re setting yourself up for<br/>\n&gt;sleeplessness.&quot;=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t think this is true.  It&#39;s worth looking into the blind studies  <br/>\n&gt;done<br/>\n&gt;with moms who were sure sugar caused hyperactivity.  It didn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-=-Well, day before yesterday, she ate a ton of otter pops AGAIN.-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Otter pops are some of the cheapest things you could possibly buy, aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;they?  For anyone unfamiliar, an otter pop is a tube of plastic with  <br/>\n&gt;flavored<br/>\n&gt;water in it you freeze in the freezer, cut the end of the plastic off,  and<br/>\n&gt;squeeze the stuff out and eat it.  It&#39;s like a popsicle in a tube, but  not <br/>\n&gt;as<br/>\n&gt;thick as popsicles (not as much flavor or sugar).  They&#39;re unfrozen  when <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;buy them, so they&#39;re cheap to ship.  You can freeze and melt and  <br/>\n&gt;re-freeze; it<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup, and we all love em, so I keep them stocked. Something like three cents <br/>\na piece. The cost is not a big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-=- I let her know that I was quite angry about that, and considered it to<br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt;extremely inconsiderate of the rest of the family for her to eat them up<br/>\n&gt;like that. I didnt&#39; shout, but I was adamant and my tone of voice was firm.<br/>\n&gt;-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your response probably did her more damage than 200 otter pops would&#39;ve  <br/>\n&gt;done.<br/>\n&gt;Was the rest of the family really wanting Otter Pops?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, Sandra, that&#39;s WHY I was angry about it. Our whole family loves <br/>\nthem. I&#39;m an otter pop fiend myself. We&#39;d all eaten a bunch, before I and my <br/>\nolder girl went out for errands. Katie wanted to stay home and <br/>\nwatch...something...on TV. When we left, there were three sheets of them, <br/>\nabout 30 individual Otter Pops. When we got back two or three hours later, <br/>\nwith the thought of a lovely green otter pop in my mind, to find them all <br/>\ngone, but two purple and a red...No, I don&#39;t think I was inappropriate to <br/>\nlet her know that her eating that many all on her own wasn&#39;t considerate. It <br/>\nWASN&#39;T. Eating (nearly) all of something, when other family members might <br/>\nwant some, too?<br/>\nThat. Is. Inconsiderate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-=-I haven&#39;t told her &quot;you can&#39;t have those otter pops&quot; -=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;WHAT?  You just did.  You told her she was extremely  inconsiderate to have<br/>\n&gt;had those otter pops.  If you say &quot;yes you can&quot; and  then get angry, that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;bigtime entrapment.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I have told all the kids is &quot;You can have as much as you want of <br/>\nsomething, but please keep in mind that there are five in the family. Don&#39;t <br/>\neat the last of the __________ (fill in the blank) without asking if someone <br/>\nhasn&#39;t had some.&quot; sometimes, if I buy something for a specific recipe later <br/>\non in the week, I&#39;ll ask the family not to eat them as snacks. Might even <br/>\nput a little note on there &quot;Strawberries for dessert on Tuesday. Please <br/>\nwait&quot; or some such. With food in general it&#39;s &quot;Please ask before eating the <br/>\nlast/all of something, if anyone else would like a piece&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy girl didn&#39;t ask anyone if they wanted some. She just ate them. If she&#39;d  <br/>\nsaid &quot;Pick up more otter pops while you&#39;re out, I&#39;m gonna finish them off&quot; <br/>\nit would have been better. At least then, I could have said &quot;well, set aside <br/>\na green one&quot; ...but just consuming them without Considering whether someone <br/>\nelse might like a few...Inconsiderate. And, her doing that was simple <br/>\nchildish inconsideration. My telling her that it made me angry was a way of <br/>\nhelping her to see that her actions have consequences for others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Can you make popsicles with juice instead of koolaid?<br/>\n&gt;We use ice trays and the rings from Discovery Toys called  &quot;Boomerings.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt;Put<br/>\n&gt;the juice in the ice tray, stick a ring in each one, and  it takes four or<br/>\n&gt;five of them to be the equivalent of a small glass of  juice.  My kids will<br/>\n&gt;still eat those, even though they&#39;re big guys.   It&#39;s a quicky little bit <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;coolness and juice.  (other kinds of plastic  rings would work, and then <br/>\n&gt;you can<br/>\n&gt;wash the rings in the dishwasher by putting  them over two posts, or in <br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;forks and spoons)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Juice is a good idea. We&#39;ve been making yogurt smoothies a lot lately. I <br/>\nwonder if freezing the pureed ingredients in paper cups would work. You just <br/>\ntear off the paper around the upper edges, and the bottom section of the cup <br/>\nbecomes the handle. Juice is a bit more expensive than otter pops, though, <br/>\nand more work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-=-What should I do, if anything, the next time she starts sucking down the<br/>\n&gt;otter pops, or the kool aid or whatever?-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Maybe find a happier healthier substitute, or just don&#39;t worry about  it.  <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t think otter pops could make anyone gain weight.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;-=-This child is not exhibiting much self control<br/>\n&gt;here. Do I need to do  something/say something to stop her? I think she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;hurting herself-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Is she eating those things because she&#39;s bored?<br/>\n&gt;Find something to do that&#39;s fun that gets her busy, uses her hands, or gets<br/>\n&gt;her out of the house where the otter pops aren&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And here, I think you&#39;ve hit the nail on the head. This little one is <br/>\nturning out to be a kid that likes to be busy, and I&#39;ve got to work harder <br/>\nat keeping up with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your advice, Sandra. It&#39;s a work in progress, and that&#39;s no lie!<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, HeidC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107016,"nextTopicId":106975}}
