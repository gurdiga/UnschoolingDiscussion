I wanted to add the next square which would be, &quot;Yeah, I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; frustrated because I hate her and now I&#39;m going to go hit her!&quot; ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well - it has been a long time since I dealt with these issues and I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t read the book in years, but I always assumed that those things<br/>\n&gt; would happen and you&#39;d just keep at it. Persevere.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The expectation that someone would be able to say these things and then<br/>\n&gt; the kid would go &quot;Oh yeah&quot; is unrealistic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What you&#39;re doing is building up credit - it takes a while. You get<br/>\n&gt; credit for listening, for commenting appropriately, for being loving<br/>\n&gt; when he&#39;s not, for having good instincts about when to hug and when to<br/>\n&gt; give space.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It isn&#39;t a magic pill - to use these ideas. It doesn&#39;t work<br/>\n&gt; instantaneously. At least not usually - although sometimes it does seem<br/>\n&gt; like a miracle cure at first.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A couple of weeks ago, at our park day, a little girl came, crying, to<br/>\n&gt; her mom. Her brother was being mean, she said. In their pretend play,<br/>\n&gt; she was his dog and she wanted to be named one thing and he said that<br/>\n&gt; was a stupid name and told her she was named something else. Her mom<br/>\n&gt; held her and hugged her while she cried and cried. She&#39;d gulp and<br/>\n&gt; breathe and recover a little and look at her mom and say, &quot;Its not fair<br/>\n&gt; I WANT to be Penny and he won&#39;t LET me.&quot; And then cry some more. Mom<br/>\n&gt; patted her back gently. She&#39;d comment just a little, once in a while -<br/>\n&gt; &quot;You REALLY want to be Penny, huh.&quot; Stuff like that. At one point mom<br/>\n&gt; kind of repeated something the girl had been saying, &quot;He called the<br/>\n&gt; name you want to be stupid,&quot; The girl&#39;s crying got MUCh bigger and she<br/>\n&gt; said, &quot;He always thinks my  ideas are stupid because he&#39;s older and he<br/>\n&gt; thinks my ideas are for babies and.....on and on in a rush of<br/>\n&gt; resentment and upset all against her brother.&quot; Mom NEVER argued with<br/>\n&gt; her. Just hugged her while she got it ALL out. Said things once in a<br/>\n&gt; while like, &quot;Oh,&quot; or other equally sympathetic, but noncommittal,<br/>\n&gt; sounds. This took a LONG time - 20 minutes maybe. The son came over in<br/>\n&gt; the middle of it - one of the other kids had tried to intervene, but he<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t budging. Eventually the girl was done and ready to go play again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The mom never got up and tried to intervene and force the boy to give<br/>\n&gt; in - even though I imagine it was really frustrating, considering how<br/>\n&gt; silly the whole fuss seemed - who CARES what name your pretend pet dog<br/>\n&gt; chooses? Answer - both of these kids cared a lot - or maybe this wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; even ABOUT that, really. Maybe he&#39;d been bossing her around for an hour<br/>\n&gt; and this was just the final straw OR maybe she&#39;d been refusing to go<br/>\n&gt; along with any of HIS ideas for the previous hour. NO way could mom<br/>\n&gt; really know. Neither kid wanted to work it out - neither wanted to talk<br/>\n&gt; about it at that point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was SO impressed with this mom&#39;s patience. She built up HUGE credit<br/>\n&gt; with her daughter - she was so there for her - so NOT impatient and<br/>\n&gt; wanting her to hurry up and get over it. She didn&#39;t interfere - allowed<br/>\n&gt; her daughter to set the timing. She didn&#39;t force a solution - didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; force her to go &quot;talk about it&quot; - didn&#39;t try to make them work it out<br/>\n&gt; since it was obvious that, at that time, anyway, neither wanted to do<br/>\n&gt; that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Her kids played happily together for hours following that incident. All<br/>\n&gt; was forgotten and forgiven. Maybe they talked about it later - or maybe<br/>\n&gt; not. I know they talk about stuff like that - when everybody is feeling<br/>\n&gt; good and they have a bit of distance and perspective. Either way, it<br/>\n&gt; was a lovely lovely thing to watch such patience and kindness and<br/>\n&gt; intelligence at work!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 12<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2003 17:50:27 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: Pamela Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: the evil Shel Silverstein<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think he wrote A Boy Named Sue - Johnny Cash&#39;s song.

He did get<br/>\n&gt; caught in that and put out of the church for it, it was some years after I<br/>\n&gt; was completely gone from there though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So my ignorance was that they were organized enough to speak out and try<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; have anything to do with legislation.

I<br/>\n&gt; made sure I did nothing to make my father angry.  But nevertheless, I<br/>\nwalked<br/>\n&gt; too loudly across the floor, I took too long in the shower.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\nscrub<br/>\n&gt; the baseboards just right, the dish water wasn&#39;t quite hot enough.

Other than I only found out about REAL unschooling<br/>\nquite<br/>\n&gt; by accident  (or maybe not)  when I was reading Sandra&#39;s website as<br/>\noffered<br/>\n&gt; by someone in a regular homeschool group.  So there are probably others<br/>\nwho<br/>\n&gt; think the same thing I did about unschooling.  Probably not enough to hurt<br/>\n&gt; unschooling as a group, but maybe enough to keep someone else away from<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; true joy that can come from it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No way to control what people call it though, you are right.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; glena<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 18<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2003 19:09:42 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zenmomma@...\">zenmomma@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: spanking was re: Christians again<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;As for the spanking part. I use it as a last resort. If they get<br/>\nspanked<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;once a month the get spanked a lot.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, they do get spanked a lot. I&#39;m glad my husband doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s<br/>\nokay<br/>\n&gt; to hit me only once a month. For that matter, I&#39;m glad my son, almost 14<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; getting bigger than me by the minute, doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s okay to hit me<br/>\nnow<br/>\n&gt; that I&#39;m smaller than him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Luckily we all have relationships based on trust and respect. I don&#39;t hit,<br/>\n&gt; my husband doesn&#39;t hit, my kids don&#39;t hit. We don&#39;t hit each other. We<br/>\ndon&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; hit other people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hope you&#39;ll listen to any negative feedback you get about spanking with<br/>\nan<br/>\n&gt; open heart. Your babes want your open arms, not the back of your hand.<br/>\nLife<br/>\n&gt; can be better without spankings and punishments. Even if it&#39;s &quot;only&quot; once<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; month.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can feel that you are a loving and giving parent, Yoki. You want what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; best for your family. Family life really can work with peaceful parenting.<br/>\n&gt; Really.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I know what it means to be abused. So does their father. And he does not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;like me to spank them for anything, but seeing as I am the<br/>\ndisciplinarian,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;he just respectfully bows out, :o)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know you are not abusing your children, but you are also not parenting<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; gently and mindfully as you maybe could. Maybe you could talk to your<br/>\n&gt; husband a bit more about why he objects to spanking.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Life is good.<br/>\n&gt; ~Mary<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The miracle is not to walk on water.
