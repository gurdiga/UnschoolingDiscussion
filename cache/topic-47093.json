If the employee has no idea <br/>\nwhat about it is wrong, they can never make it right. Likewise, if <br/>\nkids don&#39;t have conflict resolution skills, or don&#39;t know how to get <br/>\na sibling&#39;s attention in a positive way, then telling them not to hit <br/>\neach other isn&#39;t going to help anything. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I get funny with my kids and say &quot;Let&#39;s rewind this and try <br/>\nover&quot; and we do a funny rewind thing where we walk and talk backward, <br/>\nthen they try it again using the new skills. They think this is <br/>\nfunny, but then again they&#39;re much younger than yours (mine are 3 and <br/>\n6). But still, giving them the opportunity to try again and change <br/>\ntheir approach might work.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1658973,"authorName":"Barb Eaton","from":"Barb Eaton &lt;homemama@...&gt;","profile":"homesmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] how do you handle this","postDate":"1035207240","msgId":47102,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5RDk3QTg3LjEwNjlDJWhvbWVtYW1hQGluZmluZXQuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0Ny5kODFlNWQuMmFlNGYzOGNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":47098,"nextInTopic":47115,"prevInTime":47101,"nextInTime":47103,"topicId":47093,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Heidi, Welcome to unschooling. :-) One thing I d like to say is all that time your kids were in school they could avoid facing and working out fights.

The 6 and 7 year olds only fight amongst themselves. So I guess <br/>\nwe&#39;re not too bad!My oldest daughter has a friend who has a brother who is a <br/>\nlittle over 3.

Not sure if it&#39;s how things are handled or <br/>\njust the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if you two spend any time with each other just hanging out <br/>\nand having fun? I know my daughter takes plenty of time during the course of <br/>\na month (it&#39;s sporadicx with her schedule) to play with the kids. She can <br/>\nget just as silly as they can and they love it. She also spends time with <br/>\nthem or just allows them to hang out in her room, even when her friends are <br/>\nover or her boyfriend is here. When she does want time alone with her <br/>\nfriends or just herself, they are very willing to leave. I&#39;m thinking maybe <br/>\nif she wouldn&#39;t involve them in her life so much, they would be more likely <br/>\nto pester her for the attention and she more likely to resent them intruding <br/>\non her time and space.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know if some time has gone by and the kids are asking her to play with <br/>\nthem and she doesn&#39;t have the time, I&#39;ll just remind her how important it is <br/>\nfor them and she will then find time in the next day or so to do something <br/>\nwith them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe just trying to explain to your oldest how a 7 year old works and what <br/>\nhe would like from a big sister. Just do it when she&#39;s not mad at him. I <br/>\nknow my oldest likes the idea that she can be a good influence on her <br/>\nyounger siblings.
