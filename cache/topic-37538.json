It does feel manipulative to me, like placing things on<br/>\n<br/>\na child&#39;s path and hoping that she&#39;ll &quot;discover&quot; them. I&#39;m much more<br/>\ninclined to get something, say,&quot;This is a cool book about cat mummies in<br/>\n<br/>\nEgypt, if you ever want to read it - it&#39;s going right here on the<br/>\nbookshelf.&quot; and that&#39;s it.
