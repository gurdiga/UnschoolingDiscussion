It looks a little like a little harp that you hold in your lap and <br/>\npluck. It comes with sheets of music that slide under the strings and show you <br/>\nwhere to pluck. I also found them online as &quot;lap harps.&quot; I&#39;m including a link to <br/>\none and I just was entranced by it. It looked like a fun thing for folks like <br/>\nme who wish they were musically-talented. Anybody familiar with these?<br/>\n &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.outofthebluetoys.com/chilwoodzitl.html&quot;\">http://www.outofthebluetoys.com/chilwoodzitl.html&quot;</a>&gt;Children&#39;s Music Maker (Lap Harp) Musical Instrument&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nAmy Kagey<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=Z0939&gid=1684902&quot;\">http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=Z0939&gid=1684902&quot;</a>&gt;Free shipping on &lt;/A&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=Z0939&gid=1684902&quot;\">http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=Z0939&gid=1684902&quot;</a>&gt;Usborne Books&lt;/A&gt; !<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82838,"nextTopicId":82823}}
