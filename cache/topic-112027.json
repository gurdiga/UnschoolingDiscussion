Pratchett is a satirist (and a very funny one), so you get a lot of commentary on perception, when your noticing how weirdly the nomes interpret phenomena from the human world.

I said I thought so, and that there are streams and  <br/>\nflows in oceans, so they might know where they were likely to end  <br/>\nup.  But I said I thought also people had done it just for fun, like  <br/>\nletting a balloon go up with your name and address fastened to it  <br/>\n(she knows a story about that from Ripley&#39;s Believe It or Not).<br/>\n<br/>\nTuesday morning, I was looking for a rhyming dictionary link, and  <br/>\nfound this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.poetry.com/timeless/default.asp\">http://www.poetry.com/timeless/default.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not an answer to the question, but it&#39;s a heck of a good  <br/>\ncoincidence.   They&#39;re selling pretty bottles with poems on pretty  <br/>\npaper, mailed to where you order.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227139139,"authorName":"elizabeth roberts","from":"elizabeth roberts &lt;joyfullzoo@...&gt;","profile":"joyfullzoo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Today&#39;s Questions","postDate":"1139892272","msgId":112038,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMjE0MDQ0NDMzLjIzMzYxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMDA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENORURKSUJIRUdGSUFEQUFQT0ROS0VOSENCQUEuYXRqMDkwQGdhbGF4eS5vY24ubmUuanA+"},"prevInTopic":112029,"nextInTopic":112055,"prevInTime":112037,"nextInTime":112039,"topicId":112027,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Wow..that does sound interesting!

We write down questions that we have, and we talk about the answers - if we don&#39;t know the answer, then we look it up as soon as possible. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Most of these are from Sarah, but Logan has a few he wanted to know today. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Was Anastasia a real person? Why was she and her family killed? What other countries have a monarchy? Does Spain have a monarchy? Who is in charge of England now? Why do they have both a Prime Minister AND the Queen, isn&#39;t that the same? Why isn&#39;t it? Why do they even have a Queen anymore if they don&#39;t have any power? (discussion on British line of succession) Why doesn&#39;t the US have a monarchy? Why can the Pres only be president twice? Has anyone ever been president more than twice? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  What is plaster? What is rubber? What is cement? What is paint made out of?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  What do aardvarks eat?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Why do we have the internet? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Why does the ceiling look like cottage cheese? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  What is pepper? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  How are photographs made?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Why is gold rare? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Are lizards cold blooded? Are bats warm or cold blooded? Are cats warm or cold blooded? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  How do lightbulbs work?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  What is the flu?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****If anyone wants to contribute to the list anything they can think of answering for their children today, or helping their children to find out for themselves, why not add it?
