He still laughs at<br/>\nsome of the things they teach at college-much of it has nothing to do<br/>\nwith the real computer business of today (and he should know-we are<br/>\nraising a family of 5 on his almost 22 yr old business-and I&#39;m a sahm).<br/>\nMy oldest son, now 17, has been considering the possibilities of college<br/>\nbut hates the thought of &quot;wasting so much time and money&quot; (his words).<br/>\nHe has taught himself quite a bit of computer expertise (works part time<br/>\nwith &quot;Dad&quot;) and also has quite a talent with animals (has his own little<br/>\nherd of miniature horses, in addition to odds and ends of others).  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure what he&#39;ll end up choosing (I would guess probably a mix of<br/>\ncomputers and animals, but he&#39;s only 17, so ???) but I know he&#39;ll choose<br/>\nbased on what he likes and is good at.  When he was about 12-13, he went<br/>\nthrough the &quot;I think I&#39;ll be a chef&quot; phase-that was a wonderful time<br/>\naround here as he tried new recipes, invented many of his own.I ended up<br/>\ngaining a bit of weight, but he has cooking skills that will last<br/>\nforever!
