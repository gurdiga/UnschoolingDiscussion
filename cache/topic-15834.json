The reaction","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-170810510\">Good point Sandra.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 22yo dd did this as her science project in about 1st or 2nd grade. <br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure she put her baby tooth in cherry soda.<br/>\nThe reaction was that even though the carbonation from the soda<br/>\nhad dissapated within some given time (2, 4, 6 hours?); a small stream<br/>\nof bubbles continued to erupt from the tooth socket indicating that the<br/>\nsoda was eating away the tooth.  This continued throughout <br/>\nthe duration of the science fair.  I don&#39;t remember actually seeing<br/>\nany considerable sized hole in the tooth, or if any hole was visible<br/>\nat all, however, I do remember the bubble stream continuing for some<br/>\ntime that was not from the carbonation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if the chemical reaction was from the phosphoric acid,<br/>\nthe sweetner, or any other additive for that matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo cute, she won a ribbon for this project.  Her report stated<br/>\nsomething like &quot;if you eat sweets, little guys will get in your mouth <br/>\nat night and eat away your teeth.  These little guys are called plaque&quot;.<br/>\nI think she won for being the sole child who did their own science<br/>\nproject without their parent doing it for them.  (It was her desire to<br/>\nenter the science fair in that grade, not a requirement.) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 2/2/01 5:20:02 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tracy.oldfield@...\">tracy.oldfield@...</a><br/>\n&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; 1.
