I made <br/>\nthe decision this summer that I just couldn&#39;t contribute nothing to the <br/>\nnonprofit I founded a few years ago.  So this summer I joined on again, but <br/>\nas the program development coordinator (fancy word for <br/>\ngrantwriter/fundraiser).  Oddly enough, if all goes well, I will be making a <br/>\nlot more money than when I was out there trying to do this fulltime.  And the <br/>\nglory is that I work 95% from home.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is an interesting mix to try to swing hubby&#39;s 40 hour schedule and my 10 - <br/>\n20 (soemitmes 30) hour weekly schedule.  I am trying to adjust to a night <br/>\nworking schedule now.  I begin work around 8:00 PM and tie it up somewhere <br/>\nbetween 12:00 - 1:00 AM depending.  Hubby gets the boys to bed and does the <br/>\nfinal evening stuff.  The boys and I have agreed that they get up on their <br/>\nown in the morning so I can sleep till around 8:30 - 9:00.  So far, all three <br/>\nof us have surpassed the 9:00 AM wake up time on several days :o)  So I guess <br/>\nwe are trying to set up some schedule that does allow for some flexibility.  <br/>\nIf we all sleep till 10:00 AM, I guess it is OK... but we will just have to <br/>\nmake sure we try to keep up with scheduled events. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis schedule is very contrary to what I had been striving to implement for a <br/>\nfew years.  I wanted early to bed, ealry to rise for myself.  But when I do <br/>\nthat, I find that the boys don&#39;t get the attention they need until around <br/>\nnoon!!!!  I get going in my work and they just wing it for the morning.  <br/>\nGuilt tore me away from that schedule so I am trying the evening thing.  So I <br/>\nhope this transition to the evneing schedule works out.  I have my guys from <br/>\nmorning to evening and we can do whatever!  I do enjoy this part of it!  <br/>\nThough I sense tension between hubby and I on the horizon.  So, I may just <br/>\nhave to be really motivated and try to get my work done by 10:00 or 11:00 PM, <br/>\nhahaha.  If I stick a Saturday morning in there, that should work out great!  <br/>\nUGH!  Always a balancing act!<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, thanks for working through my scheduling problems with me!  I guess as <br/>\nlong as we all work together as a family and keep our communication lines <br/>\nopen, we , as a family, will make this work for all of us.  Or else I will <br/>\nquit my job! hahaha<br/>\n<br/>\nKim in Ohio</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3011,"nextTopicId":3037}}
