Also, my heart<br/>\ngoes out to you and I believe in the power of prayer and will be praying<br/>\nfor you.  It sounds like someone in the neighborhood is being vindictive<br/>\ntowards you or something.  Someone once called children&#39;s services on me<br/>\nwhen I was doing nothing just because they were being spiteful because I<br/>\nrefused to do something they were manipulating to get.  And the first<br/>\nthing the children&#39;s services person asked me was, &quot;Why do you homeschool<br/>\nyour children?  Are they seeing enough other children.  Are they learning<br/>\nenough?&quot;  And I had to really look them in the eye without fear and give<br/>\nthem my schpeel that is almost canned by now for all the imbeciles out<br/>\nthere who can&#39;t just say, &quot;Oh you homeschool?  Cool.&quot;  In my state the<br/>\nlegal age to leave a child alone is 10, and for younger children there is<br/>\na time limit on how many minutes you can leave them alone in the house. <br/>\nWhich is just weird to me because I see little kids all the time on the<br/>\nstreet and at parks who are totally unsupervised in a location that is<br/>\neven more unsafe than the home.  And I grew up often out in the country<br/>\nwhere I explored all the time in nature unsupervised and look at me, I&#39;m<br/>\nstill alive.  And I think whoever called them deserves to be sued for<br/>\nslandering your name.  But most importantly, don&#39;t give in to the fear. <br/>\nStand strong and don&#39;t give up on homeschooling your child if that is<br/>\nwhat you believe is best for him.  It sounds like his &quot;school&quot; experience<br/>\nwas just a nightmare.  Oh, and document everything social services says<br/>\nto you and does, including your argument for why he should be<br/>\nhomeschooled and why you left him at home so that if it does go too far,<br/>\nand you go to a judge, you will have evidence to present.<br/>\nJessi, I like your name.

If you are in CA, I&#39;d highly recommend contacting HSC but I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow about other states.  I would recommend that you understand your<br/>\nrights under the law.  CHN (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.californiahomeschool.net/\">http://www.californiahomeschool.net/</a> )<br/>\nused to have a know your rights section and a lot of that was applicable<br/>\nto all US citizens, not just CA ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere in CA one of our &quot;nanny state&quot; legislators wrote a law making it<br/>\na crime to leave your child alone - it took effect Jan. 1 - I don&#39;t<br/>\nrecall the age limit on that law.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nCindy Ferguson<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":832557,"authorName":"Jessi","from":"Jessi &lt;mistycal@...&gt;","profile":"mistycal32","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"I am in great need of help","postDate":"1014418004","msgId":32095,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjIuMjAwMjAyMjIxNjM2NTMuMDBhOGEzNTBAcG9wMy5id3N5cy5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":32097,"prevInTime":32094,"nextInTime":32096,"topicId":32095,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is a scary thing that is going on over here at my house...My son is almost 11 years old...

Some person decided to call <br/>\nthe police for my son being left home alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now Social Services is involved and are really questioning me on the <br/>\nfact that I am homeschooling/unschooling my son...so much in fact, that <br/>\nthey are trying to get the school district that my son used to be in, to <br/>\ntake him back without charging me tuition (we are out of district and the <br/>\nschool where we are is horrible!).  They are saying that my son is not <br/>\nsocialized enough and that he is suffering by not being in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has blossomed this year with being home.  We do not fight anymore, <br/>\nhe is no longer depressed (he was suicidal in first grade because of a <br/>\nteacher)and he smiles so much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe school in the better district promised my son so many services/help and <br/>\nnot one thing was ever done beyond the promises.  He does not want to go <br/>\nback at all and I do not want him to.  He has learned so much more being <br/>\nhome and has not had any of his old problems since he is  home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really thought it was ok for a 10 year old to be  home alone as my <br/>\nneighbor does it all the time and I know of people who have left an 8 year <br/>\nold home alone (that is too young in my book) and my son is very responsible.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe does get out and do things with his friends on the weekends, he takes <br/>\nclasses at a museum near here with other kids, he swims, he gets out all <br/>\nthe time so he does get socialized during the week...<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help would be great...Being scared right now is an <br/>\nunderstatement!!!!  I will answer any of your questions that you may have <br/>\nto help me with this problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nJessi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>\nToo often we give children answers to remember rather than problems to solve.<br/>\n~ Roger Lewin ~<br/>\n&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32090,"nextTopicId":32141}}
