My dd chose to <br/>\ndive in with me at about the same time I began persuing my interest <br/>\nin quilting.  She was 10yo, I was 38yo.  Since then, she has created <br/>\nvery interesting patterns/pillows/quilts/creations.  Currently, she <br/>\nis meandering through a quilt pattern dictionary we picked up from <br/>\nthe library.  She is interested in entering the quilt block contest <br/>\nour local Wal-Marts are hosting.  Lots of mathy talk going on here in <br/>\ntrying to get the pattern she chose to the 12.5 inch requirement <br/>\nneeded for the contest!<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I&#39;ve already chose my pattern and am half way done with it!  I <br/>\nchose the Cathedral window.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for posting!
