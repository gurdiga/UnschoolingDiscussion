That letter could have   <br/>\nbeen written by me five years ago.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI was nine years into a physically and emotionally abusive   <br/>\nmarriage. I heard the same things from my husband. And   <br/>\nafterward, when he was trying to make up, he too always   <br/>\nsaid he &quot;didn&#39;t mean it.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it turned out he did mean it. Once he found his next   <br/>\nvictim -- a younger woman -- he walked out. As he left, he   <br/>\nannounced it was because everything he&#39;d said had been the   <br/>\ntruth. I was ugly, fat, worthless, lousy in bed, and he&#39;d   <br/>\nonly stayed because he wanted to be around the kids.   <br/>\n<br/>\nYou should have advised &quot;Beaten Down&quot; to see a lawyer in   <br/>\naddition to a counselor, while she still has a shred of   <br/>\nself-esteem. Following my divorce, I got counseling. Once   <br/>\nI felt better about myself, I met a wonderful man. We&#39;re   <br/>\nmarried now. I wish I could give &quot;Beaten Down&quot; a hug,   <br/>\nbecause she&#39;s not alone. She&#39;s in my prayers.   <br/>\n-- FULL OF HOPE IN GEORGIA   <br/>\n<br/>\nFULL OF HOPE: I heard from many readers who identified with   <br/>\nthat letter and felt it was important for her to break away.   <br/>\nRead on:   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nABBY: A husband who tells his wife she&#39;s worthless and   <br/>\nstupid is using verbal abuse to wear her down and control   <br/>\nher. Marriage counseling and psychiatrists won&#39;t help. The   <br/>\nman has low self-esteem and tries to make himself appear   <br/>\npowerful and intelligent by making his wife feel inadequate.   <br/>\nEvery day she stays with him is far more harmful to the   <br/>\nchildren than taking them and leaving. Abuse is not always   <br/>\nphysical. She needs to get out BEFORE it becomes physical.   <br/>\n-- DIANE IN PENNSYLVANIA   <br/>\n<br/>\nDIANE: It&#39;s true; children model their behavior on what   <br/>\nthey&#39;re exposed to.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLife&#39;s challenges are not supposed to paralyze you;<br/>\nThey&#39;re supposed to help you discover who you are. <br/>\n~Bernice Johnson Reagon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101883,"nextTopicId":101912}}
