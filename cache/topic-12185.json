I naturally have a loud voice since <br/>\nbirth. I was a screamer as an infant. I was so loud that people would <br/>\nmove away from my parents when they sat down at church. I am also the <br/>\nsecond of six children. It got pretty loud around the house with so <br/>\nmany kids. It has taken me most of my adult life to hear that I am <br/>\ntalking louder than everyone else. Now that I have kids, I realize <br/>\nthat when I am frustrated my volum rises, again. I have learned that <br/>\nkeeping the radio and t.v. down or off helps a lot. I have also <br/>\nlearned that when I am REALLY upset with the children to use a softer <br/>\ncalmer voice. You can almost tell how irritated I am by how calm and <br/>\ncontroled my voice is. It is when things are calm around here that I <br/>\ntend to lose control of my volum. I am still working on the control <br/>\nin those frustrating times though. Think I always will.
