School started here last Monday, and the Sunday<br/>\nbefore that, Wal-Mart was JAMMED with stressed out moms and jittery kids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The kids were amazed that so many kids were buying paper!  hehehe  We<br/>\npicked up the school list for the school they would be attending and read<br/>\nover the supply list out of curiosity.  This last week, we drove by on our<br/>\nway to the Sam Davis Home to take pictures of the corn and there were kids<br/>\noutside running around.  I asked my oldest if he felt sad about not being<br/>\nwith them and he said, &quot;No, I just feel sad that they have to go.  Mom?  Can<br/>\nwe go to the park and ride bikes and look for bugs?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess he has no feelings about it, since he has never gone, but I found<br/>\nmyself looking forward to the start of school.  There are less kids out and<br/>\nit seems the &#39;bullies&#39; are ALL mysteriously gone!  Now the kids can play on<br/>\nthe playground and use the pool in our community without a kid twice their<br/>\nage and half their intellect bossing them around...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It also seems that once school starts, we are able to get back on more of<br/>\na schedule.  It seems everything child-related revolves around school hours<br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, maybe I don&#39;t get the same ones you do-but I DO have some<br/>\nback-to-school feelings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Esther<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
