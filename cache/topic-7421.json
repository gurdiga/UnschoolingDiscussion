But sometimes I have to beat him over the head with a club to get him to see when I am falling apart.  &lt;sigh&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what happens when we do not raise young men to be intuitive, emotional, feeling and compassionate creatures.  I am raising my boys to be whole people, I hope.  My hubby&#39;s biggest complaint about his upbringing is how out of touch with his feelings and those of others he is and his inability and struggles to express himself and communicate.  This is I think in part due to his natural shyness, but also due to having his own father as an example, and his mom too for that matter.  I think they are two of the most uncommunicative people I have ever met, except for my folks, who have them beat hands down.  But his father was often absent and does not express tenderness well, or any of the &quot;weaker&quot; or more &quot;female associated&quot; emotions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think his second biggest complaint/wound from his childhood is his father&#39;s absence.  He was always too busy with work or his own hobbies to be there for his only son.  No face at the swim meets, little league, or other events, no presence in the home like his mother.  How sad, and yet how typical.  How horrible what we do to our boys, and every bit as horrifying as what we do to girls.  Thank the Goddess for Unschooling, free thinking, and respect for children.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.

That is a long day!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are an astute woman!  This is very much a continuing problem here-how <br/>\ndoes Mom recharge?  Plus, my dh commutes 2 hours per day, six days a week, on <br/>\ntop of working 12 hour days and 8 on Saturdays. <br/>\nWe are in the process of re-evaluating jobs, home location, etc.  But, for <br/>\nright now, his job is a grand one that supports all of us and to move closer <br/>\nto the job would increase our expenditures for housing (it&#39;s near Chicago).<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess all I can say to this query is that my life is a work in progress.  <br/>\nWe&#39;re trying to work together to meet all of our needs.  The day I wrote <br/>\nabout online, to tell the truth, did wear me out.  Not all my days are quite <br/>\nthat hectic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way I&#39;ve found to recharge is simply to steal little moments to <br/>\nmyself.  Like now, for instance, my 3 older kids are gone, my 3 youngers are <br/>\nplaying in the basement and the baby is asleep.  So, I&#39;m foregoing the <br/>\nhousework and playing here instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh and I usually put the kids in bed early except the 3 older ones and <br/>\ntalk a walk for about 1/2 hour each evening.  That helps.<br/>\n <br/>\nOften, in the evenings, my dh will supervise the kids while I go into the <br/>\nbedroom and talk on the phone to my sister or a friend, or just read.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have found it vital to keep some interests going outside the home, in <br/>\norder to keep my perspective.  So, I write a newsletter for a drama group in <br/>\ntown and sometimes (though very rarely) I do freelance writing work.  This is <br/>\na mixed blessing, because sometimes I do not need one more responsibility.  <br/>\nBut, sometimes the diversion keeps me sane.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also try to get to the library once a week by myself and I read as much as <br/>\nI can.  I also think it&#39;s important to keep up on what&#39;s going on in the <br/>\nworld, so I read a daily newspaper for entertainment.  My hubby and I also go <br/>\nout with another couple for dinner at least once a month and usually manage a <br/>\ndinner or lunch ourselves.  We often go for a drive on Sunday afternoons <br/>\nafter we&#39;ve hired a babysitter.  (during the little one&#39;s nap time)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a church going person, so I take time to pray, go visit the beautiful <br/>\nquiet chapel in our community and talk to other mothers I see there.  I also <br/>\ntry to visit a couple of elderly people I know because they give me wonderful <br/>\ninsights!<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to belong to outside groups, but have cut back on those because they <br/>\nreally cut into time with my hubby.<br/>\n  <br/>\nI think about taking a class for intellectual stimulation, but haven&#39;t gotten <br/>\nthat far yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, yes, I must admit, most things take a back seat to the kids.  I know <br/>\nthis time is relatively short (although with 7 it doesn&#39;t seem that way!), <br/>\nand situations are always changing.  My life is easier now than when I had <br/>\nfour children under 7 and no older kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as cooking, housework, etc., I&#39;ve learned to take a really relaxed <br/>\napproach here.  My house is not a big mess...but it wouldn&#39;t win contests for <br/>\nGood Housekeeping either.  The truth is, I don&#39;t want to spend a lot of time <br/>\ncooking and cleaning.  They are not my priorities.  So, we stick with <br/>\nsimplicity.  We all do basic pick-up and feeding pets, etc. a couple of times <br/>\na day.  Then on Sat. a.m. the kids and I usually do some deeper cleaning.  <br/>\nOne of the kids helps with laundry each week and we try to do 2 loads a day.  <br/>\nWe stick with simple suppers and my dh is really good about helping when he <br/>\ncomes home from work.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not perfect, but it works for us mostly.  When it doesn&#39;t, we change it. <br/>\nI know you&#39;ve heard it before-but it really is always a balancing act!<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t mean to go on so.

I suspect you and everyone else has <br/>\nfound or will find the answers in the continual quest for balance.  This will <br/>\ncome with time and experience, I am sure.  But as others have expressed, this <br/>\nwill be a &quot;dance&quot; that will continue to change as time goes by.  Some days I <br/>\nfind more time for me, or things like taking care of household chores, <br/>\nsometimes there seems to be very little time; and then, again, there do seem <br/>\nto be &quot;windows&quot; of time during the average day where things slow down, and <br/>\nthen I choose to do something that I want or need to do.  Also, I think it&#39;s <br/>\nimportant to include the kids in household tasks, when possible, so that the <br/>\nparents don&#39;t shoulder the entire burden.  I like to talk with my kids and <br/>\nget  their ideas of what they want to do during the day, then we  try  to <br/>\nplan a schedule --not rigidly-- but enough of  a plan so that they can see <br/>\nthat my needs ( which may include sewing, painting, or cleaning, etc...)  are <br/>\nalso going to be included in the mix.  Of course, like anything, there are <br/>\ndays where it runs smoothly, and other days  where I wonder what day of the <br/>\nweek it is , and it is already 11:00am and I am not dressed...  But I need <br/>\ntime too, we all do; not only for ourselves and our sense of peace, but also <br/>\nbecause we are better parents to our kids when we get some peace and quiet <br/>\nall to ourselves.  I find that I am more patient with my kids if I can have a <br/>\nlittle time for me, &lt;like spending some time on the computer :) &gt;.
