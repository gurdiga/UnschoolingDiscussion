I live on a small U.S. army base in<br/>\nGermany.  There&#39;s plenty happening around here, just not in English.  My son<br/>\nprefers to not try to function in German.  That&#39;s fine, it&#39;s his choice.<br/>\nBut it does limit our options.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son takes tap dance lessons from a British woman who comes out once a<br/>\nmonth from the city to teach him (I&#39;d drive there, but she doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nspace.  So I pay for her to come here.)  He plays soccer in the army&#39;s rec<br/>\nprogram.  He&#39;s involved at our church, but I drive 1/2 hr. each way for<br/>\nthat.  And we do cub scouts locally.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, he does get use out of the local public (military) school.  I know<br/>\nthis isn&#39;t a popular suggestion with some homeschoolers, but it&#39;s realistic<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re truly isolated.  See if there&#39;s a policy already in place (or if<br/>\nthey&#39;d create one for you) that would allow for your children to take a<br/>\nclass like art or music, get involved in extracurricular activities, clubs,<br/>\nor athletics, or so on.  If the public school turns you down, try a private<br/>\nschool.  They might be more accomodating.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year, Tim went to a library &quot;class&quot; at the school and was in chess<br/>\nclub.  This year, he&#39;s interested in taking art, library, and a once-a-week<br/>\nliterature class that&#39;s a new &quot;special&quot; they&#39;re offering.  They also added a<br/>\ncomputer club he thought about checking out.  Things we&#39;re not taking but<br/>\nthat were open to us were aikido (did I spell that martial art right?),<br/>\nchess, general music, guitar club, p.e., etc.  I don&#39;t have a problem with<br/>\nusing the schools, we just do it our way.  And this year, the school called<br/>\nME to see what Tim wanted to do.  Maybe they&#39;re getting $$ for his<br/>\noccasional presence.  I don&#39;t care, the money won&#39;t hurt them any; I just<br/>\nwant to get what he wants and not have to commit to more than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as whether the lessons are useful or enjoyable depends on your<br/>\nchildren!  Can you make a once a month trek to the homeschooling group of<br/>\nthe nearest town?  (Where are you?)  Would it be possible to drive to<br/>\nsomething a couple hours away occasionally?  Have you called the community<br/>\nrec dept. or parks dept. or whatever to see if they could offer more kid<br/>\nstuff?  You may have to be really proactive!<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, if your children can identify what it is they&#39;d like to do, ask<br/>\naround.  I found the tap dance teacher through a friend of a friend who<br/>\nheard I was looking for someone who spoke English.  Even small towns have<br/>\ntalented people who do all sorts of stuff, and they might well be interested<br/>\nin working with a homeschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2294225,"authorName":"freeform@juno.com","from":"freeform@...","profile":"freeform_ca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Re: Importance of &quot;outside&quot; activities","postDate":"1062353679","msgId":79615,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwODMxLjExMTQ0MC4zMjguMi5mcmVlZm9ybUBqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":79590,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":79614,"nextInTime":79616,"topicId":79542,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Sun, 31 Aug 2003 09:10:30 -0500 Gary & Lisa Williams  ...

After doing soccer for 4 years, two seasons each<br/>\nyear, she&#39;s not doing soccer this year, and it feels weird. Those all<br/>\ninvolve kid-interaction, but Rain&#39;s main focus is the activity itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe generally hit a few activities with one of the local homeschool groups<br/>\nevery month - park day, astronomy night, farmer&#39;s market crafts day, or<br/>\nsomething. For those things, Rain mainly plays with other kids - at<br/>\nastronomy night last night, she took 2 30 second peeks through the<br/>\ntelescope, jumped on the tramp for an hour with kids, and then organized<br/>\nthe group into the cast of Peter Pan and got halfway through the second<br/>\nact. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s just going to someone&#39;s house to play, which happens a lot,<br/>\ntoo...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all enjoyable, I think. I don&#39;t know if Rain always enjoys dance<br/>\nclasses, but she wants to take them to further her musical theater<br/>\nambitions, so she does. I think what&#39;s enjoyable is always useful,<br/>\nbecause enjoyment is useful...<br/>\n<br/>\nRain is not as happy when we spend more than a day at home with just us,<br/>\nor even with the boys next door. She thrives on lots of action and<br/>\ninteraction. We live about 40 minutes from the town where we do most of<br/>\nthis stuff, so it&#39;s a drive to do most anything. On the other hand,<br/>\nthat&#39;s just Rain.
