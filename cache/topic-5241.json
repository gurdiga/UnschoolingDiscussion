She owned nothing except<br/>\nthe rights to 150 of her dances.  Her dance company which she founded in<br/>\n1929 supported her but on very little money (because they couldn&#39;t afford<br/>\nit) and she never cared about anything except dance.  She put her entire<br/>\nsoul into her work and accomplished great but unmaterialistic things.  <br/>\n(Many others that are as revolutionary and influential in their<br/>\nprofessions like, Stravinsky or Picasso, made a lot more money eventually.  <br/>\nBut dance probably because it is a &quot;female&quot; art form --that&#39;s for another<br/>\ndiscussion-- never &quot;pays&quot; very well).

Of<br/>\nnecessity, many of them had  side businesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose Rembrandt had owned and operated a small &quot;bed and breakfast&quot;<br/>\nbusiness in order to pay the bills.

in the belief that $ is the end<br/>\nall and the primary motivation for nearly all we choose to undertake.  this is<br/>\none of the conflicting interests of our ps system.  there&#39;s a interesting<br/>\narticle in the &quot;path of learning&quot; mag (www.great-ideas.org/paths.htm)  entitled<br/>\n&quot;public education, alternative schools, and democracy&quot;.   the article states<br/>\nthat there are three major purposes underlying the different agendas people<br/>\nhave for ps.   the three purposes are:<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;(1) we want our schools to promote democracy (and &#39; a major reason for th(e)<br/>\nfailure (of this) is that the public school is also expected to serve a second<br/>\npurpose&#39;)<br/>\n(2) we also want them to support a competitive economic system  (&#39; the<br/>\npromotion of economic growth in a fundamentally competitive and hierarchical<br/>\nsystem of production&#39;), while<br/>\n(3) we also want them to inculcate moral values and civic virtues.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nron miller, the author, goes on to say:<br/>\n&#39;in more organic societies, such as premodern or indigenous cultures, these<br/>\nrealms of politics, economics, and morality are in substantial harmony, and a<br/>\ncoherent education emerges quite naturally in daily life of a community (as<br/>\nnative american educator gregory cajete has nicely described).   but in modern<br/>\nindustrial/scientific cultures, particularly the restless and rootless culture<br/>\nof the united states, there are deep seated tensions between these spheres, and<br/>\nto the extent that an educational approach embraces one of them, the others are<br/>\ndiminished.   people with different educational ideals struggle to establish<br/>\none or another purpose above the others.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nmiller also says that, in terms of the economic agenda (2), &#39;there is no<br/>\ndenying that fierce competition inevitably produces big winners (enormously<br/>\nwealthy families and exclusive communities, robber barons and cooperate<br/>\nraiders) and demoralized losers (a disempowered working class and an<br/>\nimpoverished underclass),  and to a large extent the winners enjoy as much<br/>\ncontrol over social policy as did the aristocracy in jefferson&#39;s day.   when we<br/>\nask schools,  as bill clinton explicitly did a few years back, to serve &quot;one<br/>\nhigh standard:  are our children learning what they need to know to compete and<br/>\nwin in the global economy?&quot;,  we are asking them to sabotage the goal of<br/>\ndemocratic education, because for every child who competes and wins, there are<br/>\nothers who will compete and lose.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nthis society places so much emphasis on one&#39;s bank account,  what one wears,<br/>\nwhere one lives,  that we (as a whole) have becomes slaves to our image, and  i<br/>\nbelieve at the expense of our purpose, our sense of self and happiness, as well<br/>\nas our relationship to others and our community.   last night on some tv show<br/>\nlike 20/20 they interviewed &#39;arguably the most intelligent man in america&#39; who<br/>\ntested so high on the iq test they gave him that he could not be measured but<br/>\nhis lasted measurable score was 195.   he lives on $6000/year, lives in a very<br/>\nsmall house, is writing a book about mathematically proving the existence of<br/>\nthe spirit, and is presently working as a bounced at a bar.  the interviewer<br/>\nwas very surprised that he never finished college, was not focused on getting<br/>\nrich, was perfectly happy living on a small amount of $ and was pursuing a goal<br/>\nthat would most likely never bring him $ or solve the problem of world hunger<br/>\n(i think the assumption is:  if you don&#39;t want $ then you must be a complete<br/>\naltruist, a &#39;mother theresa&#39; type).<br/>\n<br/>\nit seem to be hard for many many people to understand that $ is not the focus<br/>\nof everyone&#39;s life and is not the standard by which those people measure their<br/>\nhappiness.   for our family $ buys time and has no other real significance.  it<br/>\nholds no power or prestige just another tool we find along the way.   that&#39;s<br/>\nnot to say we wouldn&#39;t mind winning the lottery (though we would have to start<br/>\nplaying for that to be likely to happen) it&#39;s just not an important issue.<br/>\nboth my husband and myself are artists, sculptor and painter respectively,  and<br/>\nour son seems to be leaning toward the world of science and mathematics (just<br/>\nto keep it all in balance:) and the power $ can bring is of no consequence but<br/>\nhappiness, creativity and an open and curious mind are paramount.<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin,tx</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5258,"nextTopicId":5260}}
