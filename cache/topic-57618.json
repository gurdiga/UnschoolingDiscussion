I&#39;m pretty sure it was the second set, Oskar & Jack.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a TV show on PBS (Nova maybe?) years ago, and the twins I&#39;m <br/>\nthinking about both kept their desks exactly the same way, and their closets <br/>\ntoo.   And when interviewed one said it&#39;s because his mom was such a slob and <br/>\nhe never wanted to be keep house like she did, and the other said it was <br/>\nbecause his mom was so neat and taught him how to be that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nn Anecdotal twin stories - MZs - 2 boys separated at approximately 1 month, <br/>\nadopted by working class families, in Ohio, both named Jim by their adoptive <br/>\nfamilies.  When they were reunited as adults the following &quot;coincidences&quot; <br/>\nwere noted: both developed sinus headaches at age ten, which later became <br/>\nmigraines, they used the same words to describe their pain. They had <br/>\nidentical pulse rates and blood pressure. They both held clerical positions <br/>\nand liked to do woodworking as a hobby. They both volunteered on police <br/>\nforces, enjoyed Florida vacations, married and divorced women named Linda, <br/>\nhad dogs named Toy, and drove Chevrolets.<br/>\n<br/>\nn Oskar and Jack - Born in Trinidad. Mother, a German, took Oskar back to G <br/>\nw/ her and raised him as a Catholic. He grew up to be a Nazi (youth group). <br/>\nHis brother, Jack, was raised by the dad in the Carribean and raised as a <br/>\nJew, spent some of his adolescence in Isreal on a kibbutz.  When they were <br/>\nreunited, Jack was living in CA and O in G. When they met bqueurs, tended to <br/>\nfall asleep while watching TV, kept rubber bands on their wrists, thought it <br/>\nwas funny to sneeze in a crowd of people, flushed the toilet before using it, <br/>\nand read magazines from cover to cover<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57140,"nextTopicId":57621}}
