That is so true for me. Your whole post just really hit home.<br/>\nI had a traumatic experience in school (1st grade) and totally shut down to <br/>\nmath after that.<br/>\nThe funny thing is, I&#39;ve always felt like I should be ok at it, because I <br/>\ntend to pick up concepts fairly quick. But as soon as I try putting it to <br/>\npaper or forced to do problems, I just freeze up mentally.<br/>\nBut I can do almost any percentage in my head, I&#39;m beginning to add, subtract <br/>\nand multiply larger numbers without a calculator (yes, just beginnning to in <br/>\nmy 30&#39;s!!!)<br/>\nand doubling or tripling recipes was always fairly simple for me.<br/>\nIn fact, I used the image of measuring cups to figure out other fraction <br/>\nproblems in life, because in the kitchen it&#39;s easy enough, but elsewhere I <br/>\nwould struggle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need you to come tutor ME Pam!!!!<br/>\nI want to get over this fear of math, this feeling of incompetency.<br/>\nMost math posts go right over my head and I hate that. I want my kids to see <br/>\nthe fun in manipulating numbers and using math.<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to teach myself some little tricks to help me get past <br/>\nthis....it&#39;s so hard.<br/>\nsigh.....<br/>\nThanks for a great post Pam!!!
