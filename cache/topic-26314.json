No<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To those who pointed it out, your right, he is very little and I was<br/>\nforgetting. Distraction is a wonderful tool and I really shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nknock it. We do us distraction more than anything else in our home. I<br/>\nguess I just wanted to make sure I wasn&#39;t over using it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He went from not sharing to out and out straight in the eye defiance <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He wants to know what is going to happen when he doesn&#39;t share.

I tries to look at this more from my sons<br/>\nperspective. I thought about how Morgan has really gotten good at<br/>\nwalking lately and is in more and more of the house than ever before.<br/>\nHow she&#39;s better at following him than she was before and how he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get as much alone time as he used to. (he&#39;s more of an<br/>\nintrovert.) And of course how he hasn&#39;t had alot of Mommy alone time<br/>\neither.<br/>\n<br/>\nFriday night I made sure we snuggled a little extra. Saturday morning<br/>\ninstead of sitting in my chair and knitting I sat on the pillows with<br/>\nQuin and his cars and played with him. When Morgan came over I made<br/>\nsure to offer her something from a different group of toys than what<br/>\nQuin was playing with. Then we talked about how hard it is sometimes<br/>\nwhen other people come over to play, but how it&#39;s more fun with more<br/>\npeople too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, why am I so bothered by a child in our playgroup bringing a<br/>\n&gt; large ride on toy and not sharing it with anyone? In our family the<br/>\n&gt; rules is if you bring something to the group expect to share it with<br/>\n&gt; the group. If you don&#39;t want to share it leave it at home.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I spent some time thinking about this one too. I don&#39;t share my car at<br/>\nplaygroup, though, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d mind either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also thought about how a few months back my son didn&#39;t want to share<br/>\ntoys at playgroup. I didn&#39;t force him too but I also didn&#39;t &quot;watch&quot;<br/>\nhis toys for him either. He quickly learned it was alot of work to<br/>\nactively hoarde his toys and it wasn&#39;t much fun either. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also thought about how the person didn&#39;t seem very familiar to me. I<br/>\nthough aout how I am much faster to share with my established friends<br/>\nthan with a complete stranger.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the analogy that was posted about the toy-luck or the BYOT. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My son is 3 years and my daughter is 15 months<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Someone had asked why I want them to share.

Showed him how sad his sister<br/>\n&gt; looks. How angry Daddy looks. Dear son, please notice how upset you<br/>\n&gt; are when the boy at the park won&#39;t share the car he brought. Dear son,<br/>\n&gt; please notice how much fun is had with you and your friends when you<br/>\n&gt; share your toys. Mommy LOVES sharing with you. Mommy doesn&#39;t grab<br/>\n&gt; things from you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; talk talk talk example example example<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; and then at wits end &quot;Go to the bedroom and chill out&quot; NOW<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What am I missing here?===<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the problem is that your focus is still on making him share. <br/>\nPointing out how his choice affects his sister can be really helpful, <br/>\nbut not in the context of &quot;look how bad she feels, share now or take a <br/>\ntime out.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve found more successful is helping my kids negotiate use of <br/>\ncommon toys and supporting their ownership over their own toys. So, my <br/>\napproach might differ depending upon the ownership. Children need to own <br/>\ntheir things in the same way we do. I wouldn&#39;t force dh to share his <br/>\nipod out of a principle that sharing is good, yet, he freely chooses to <br/>\nshare his older ipod shuffle with the kids. Sharing is good, generally <br/>\nspeaking, but not always and in all cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were something of common ownership, I&#39;d help the kids arrive at a <br/>\nsolution that worked for them both. It&#39;s really hard to share. Start <br/>\nthere; start by validating and showing him that your on his side. Then <br/>\nmove to the observation of the other&#39;s reaction: she looks really sad <br/>\nbecause she sees how much fun you&#39;re having with it. Then, I&#39;d ask if we <br/>\ncould come up with a solution, which with such young kids might end up <br/>\nbeing as vague as &quot;could you tell her when you&#39;re done using it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEspecially if your son has been forced to share, he will need lots of <br/>\ntime and space to get the idea that you&#39;re not going to force him to do <br/>\nthat anymore, to realize that you&#39;re on his side rather than against <br/>\nhim. What worked for us for quite a while was offering a specific time <br/>\nframe or number of turns that made it easier for the waiting person, but <br/>\nthat was something we arrived at together rather than something I <br/>\nimposed, and it was in the context of not being forced to give something <br/>\nup. There were no time-outs or loss of something for a day backing it <br/>\nup, only the idea that it is really hard to wait.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ===He went from not sharing to out and out straight in the eye <br/>\n&gt; defiance ===<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, because he&#39;s trying to retain his sense of self, his sense of <br/>\nsovereignty over himself. Can you re-read the words below and see how <br/>\nadversarial they sound? How would you react to someone doing the same <br/>\nthing to you? Defiant? I know I would.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ===He wants to know what is going to happen when he doesn&#39;t share. Up<br/>\n&gt; until now he&#39;s gotten a talk from mommy and the toy in question given<br/>\n&gt; to the other child or taken out of the scenario for the rest of the <br/>\n&gt; day.===<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ===Also, why am I so bothered by a child in our playgroup bringing a<br/>\n&gt; large ride on toy and not sharing it with anyone? In our family the<br/>\n&gt; rules is if you bring something to the group expect to share it with<br/>\n&gt; the group. If you don&#39;t want to share it leave it at home.===<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe do some reading around about rules vs. principles. Think about the <br/>\ndifference for a while and see if it doesn&#39;t change your perspective; it <br/>\ndid mine.

My 7yo used to bring her<br/>\nscooter to a park day, and she would share it willingly with no problems.<br/>\nOne day, a group of girls got together and tried to enforce their rules for<br/>\nwhen and how she shared the scooter upon her. A family who has a lot of<br/>\nschooled children but also friends in the group had come that day, and those<br/>\nchildren in particular seemed very fixated on *making* my daughter share. I<br/>\nintervened when I saw what was going on. It was pretty awful -- a pack<br/>\nchasing and yelling at her, telling her that she had to get off because it<br/>\nwas so-and-so&#39;s turn. When I came up, I think the girls expected me to help<br/>\nthem force the scooter from her. It had truly never been an issue before<br/>\nthat day -- she enjoyed seeing her friends have fun riding her scooter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think it&#39;s dramatically more of a challenge to set up the kind of<br/>\nsituation that Robyn describes when you have two toddlers!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 20-month-old and 3-year-old oftentimes will start grabbing things from<br/>\neach other. The 20-month-old, for example, even when he has his own little<br/>\nbowl of pomegranate seeds, might see that his older sister has some and try<br/>\nto take hers from her as well. Which of course is completely developmentally<br/>\nnormal -- but I understand that it&#39;s hard on everyone, particularly my older<br/>\ngirl (in my family it&#39;s not helped by the fact that the younger one has a<br/>\nnaturally more aggressive quality *and* he weighs within a pound or two of<br/>\nwhat she does). And sometimes either one of them will only want precisely<br/>\nwhat the other one has.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what helps is, yes, distraction and intervention. I don&#39;t mean in a<br/>\n&quot;Let&#39;s all sit down and share&quot; way, but in a &quot;Here, come sit down with me.<br/>\nLet&#39;s read a book while you&#39;re eating the seeds&quot; -- and then place them on<br/>\ndifferent sides of me so it&#39;s less of an issue. Also, making sure that we<br/>\ndon&#39;t have a situation of scarcity: &quot;Would you like more seeds? We have<br/>\nlots. I can cut another pomegranate.&quot; My little kids do love it when I give<br/>\nthem a *big* bowl of whatever -- I think they like the feeling of abundance<br/>\n(I know I would). And, even though we have a lot of toys, we don&#39;t have as<br/>\nmany as might be needed a certain points; there&#39;s also the effect of one<br/>\ntoddler wanting whichever toy the other one has because its value is enhance<br/>\nby its position in the other child&#39;s hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I assess the situation and see which of them seems to be<br/>\nparticularly interested in a given toy right then and there try to bring the<br/>\nother one off to do something with just me alone.

That is a lot to share.  It isn&#39;t<br/>\nsomething he can control at all.  But, a toy, a piece of candy, a big<br/>\nriding something at the park, all of those things can be held and kept<br/>\nand enjoyed all by himself.  And a 15 month old can be distracted so<br/>\nmuch more easily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nForcing sharing often seems to produce children who no way no how want<br/>\nto share.  I once watched a little 3 year old boy who&#39;d borrowed a<br/>\nscooter from us at a campground and who had invented this really fun<br/>\ngame to play with it have it taken away from him by his mother because<br/>\nsome other little girl noticed that he was playing with it.  Not only<br/>\ndid she take the scooter away from him, but she then played with the<br/>\nother little girl, leaving him with nothing to do and noone to play<br/>\nwith.  As I watched I thought about how he would learn very quickly to<br/>\nplay where no one could see him, how he would learn that enjoying<br/>\nsomething publically could lead to having whatever he was playing with<br/>\nbe taken away from him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon and Linnaea, who will give away their last piece of chocolate<br/>\nwithout thinking, or will search the house for toys they want to give<br/>\nto friends before they go home, are far less likely to share with each<br/>\nother than with any other person. There seem to be too many power<br/>\nstruggles between siblings to expect consistent sharing.  I just try<br/>\nand give them space to not share, doing things like offering to play a<br/>\ngame with Linnaea when Simon won&#39;t let her play with his Yu-gi-oh<br/>\ncards, or helping Simon find something special to eat when Linnaea<br/>\nwon&#39;t share something special to eat that she has.  It stops the<br/>\nfighting between the two of them and takes away the sense of loss from<br/>\nthe one left out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;quinlonsma&quot;<br/>\n&lt;quinlonsma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; :-/<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not trained for this.

When your three, or five, or even seven year old is your <br/>\noldest, it is easy to think of them as BIG.

I would also never expect other kids to share at the park and I <br/>\nwould *never* force my child to share their toys with others (especially <br/>\nstrangers).  Maybe the child that brought the large ride on toy to the <br/>\npark doesn&#39;t have a place at home where they can play with it?  Why <br/>\nshould they have to give up their only time with their toy to others?  I <br/>\ncertainly wouldn&#39;t let anyone touch my bicycle when I take it to the <br/>\npark...  I also don&#39;t let anyone play with my car, or listen to my CDs, <br/>\nor touch my bag, or take my food, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, sharing is way overrated.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lisa in AZ</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Sharing","postDate":"1129353930","msgId":108956,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PGRpcG84ZitpZnNoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":108954,"nextInTopic":108959,"prevInTime":108955,"nextInTime":108957,"topicId":26314,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-233376274\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; 3year olds are a challenge unlike any other.<br/>\n<br/>\nMine isn&#39;t sharing.
