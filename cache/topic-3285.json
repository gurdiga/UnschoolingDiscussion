Went to college (bc my parents thought I<br/>\nshould), had a blast, got A&#39;s & B&#39;s in what  liked, withdrew from classes<br/>\nI didn&#39;t like.  Summer after first year of college met 2 High School<br/>\nfriends in Kodiak AK, the plan was to earn LOTS of $$ for college (of<br/>\ncourse).  I Loved it & stayed nine years.  Some of what I did: babysat<br/>\nfor room and board, worked in canneries in town & in remote area, lied<br/>\nabout my age to work in pizza parlor that served beer, lied that I had<br/>\nexperience as a waitress to get first waitress job, took care of elderly<br/>\nwoman for room and board, didn&#39;t work sometimes until I ran out of money,<br/>\nhiked, camped, caught salmon with my bare hands, marvelled at the<br/>\nabsolute beauty of Alaska, worked for the forest service, lived without<br/>\nrunning water or electricity, played games on long winter evenings<br/>\nwithout electricity, took a side trip to Hawaii for 3 months & lived in a<br/>\ntent while waiting tables (which by now I really did have experience at),<br/>\nthen got a job at a small health food store & decided to get a degree in<br/>\nnutrition.

I said, &quot;Go for it!&quot; My instinct immediately told me that would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;be a good thing for him.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m going to encourage him to go! He needs a wake-up call to life.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Denise<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good for you!  It is refreshing to hear about someone with a son whom they<br/>\n&gt; encourage to be independent.  In my family the boys were SOOOOOO spoiled.<br/>\n&gt; My brother (27) lives with my parents still (along with his wife and two<br/>\n&gt; children) because he does not know what he wants to be when he grows up<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; does not make enough money right now to support his family.  I keep<br/>\ntelling<br/>\n&gt; them that he needs to get a different job and move away (far away) from<br/>\nour<br/>\n&gt; parents so he can learn how to be responsible for himself and be truly &quot;on<br/>\n&gt; his own.&quot;  His wife could not agree more.  She is in school full time, has<br/>\n&gt; finished her degree and has another year to complete her certification to<br/>\n&gt; teach High School.  She is absolutely sick to death of being nagged and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;mothered&quot; by my/his mom, who is definately the intrusive type.  I think<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; would live there happily forever if nobody pushes him.  Getting meals<br/>\n&gt; cooked for him most days no matter WHAT his varying schedule might be,<br/>\n&gt; having free babysitters any night of the week, Not worrying about bills or<br/>\n&gt; house maintenance, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3275,"nextTopicId":3321}}
