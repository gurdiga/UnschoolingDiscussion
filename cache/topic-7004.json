I was pretty<br/>\nstressed out, but time helped alot.<br/>\nI too have a story to share...  it&#39;s kind of like the flour story.

Hysterical...!<br/>\nThen there was the time the middle one was probably 1.5 and the oldest<br/>\n2, and they discovered the oatmeal container, and had that all over the<br/>\nkitchen floor.  They were having a blast.  Yes, I have pictures of both.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime has saved me.....    :)<br/>\nNow my youngest is 3, middle 5, and oldest 7...Life is still crazy, but<br/>\nmuch easier.<br/>\nAnn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6999,"nextTopicId":7005}}
