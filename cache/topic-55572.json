Many carefully controlled studies have been conducted to test this idea <br/>\nand failed to find any effect of sugar consumption on children&#39;s behavior. <br/>\nWhy, then do so many people believe that sugar causes hyperactivity in <br/>\nchildren? One possibility is that parent&#39;s beliefs affect what they see. In <br/>\none recent study, a group of children thought to be &quot;behaviorally sensitive&quot; <br/>\nto sugar were studied. The children were divided into two groups. The mothers <br/>\nof one group were told that their children were given a drink with a lot of <br/>\nsugar. The mothers of the other group were told that their children had been <br/>\ngiven a drink that did not contain sugar. All children had actually been <br/>\ngiven a drink sweetened with Nutrasweet. The mothers who thought that their <br/>\nchildren had had sugar rated them as more hyperactive than the other mothers. <br/>\nThese results suggest that parents&#39; and teachers&#39; beliefs about sugar affect <br/>\ntheir perceptions of children&#39;s behavior. Another possibility is that parents <br/>\nwho believe that sugar makes their children hyperactive only allow them to <br/>\nhave sugar for special occasions, such as birthday parties or family <br/>\ngatherings. These are occasions where children tend to be somewhat excited <br/>\nand active anyway. Then when the parents see their children being very active <br/>\nand excited, they think that it is due to the sugar. But regardless of the <br/>\nreason for people&#39;s erroneous beliefs about this, it is quite clear that <br/>\nsugar does not produce hyperactivity, even when researchers have specifically <br/>\nfocused on children with a presumed &quot;sugar sensitivity&quot;.<br/>\nPublished on: 31 May 2000<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/education/ask/qna.html?question_id=241\">http://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/education/ask/qna.html?question_id=241</a>  (the bit <br/>\nabove is from this link)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aspartame.net/media/news/nbctoday.html\">http://www.aspartame.net/media/news/nbctoday.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLots more there...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n.

There have been numerous <br/>\nstudies conducted that many parents refuse to believe.

We&#39;ve all seen it at birthday parties <br/>\nwhere candy, ice cream and cake flow to children that finally have an excuse <br/>\nto eat as much as they can. Maybe just the restriction itself being lifted <br/>\nfrom not as much candy as you want to go at it, makes the difference in <br/>\nbehavior.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis i find interesting, because the one that the candy seems to affects Avery (1.5) the most and he hasn&#39;t had the restrictions on the candy that Jaiden has had, at the same time though, Jaiden has always been so very active that if he&#39;s a little more so than normal it&#39;s still not as noticable as Avery that has always been so calm, in comparision to Jaiden i&#39;ve been told by other parents they don&#39;t know how I do it with two &quot;such active and hyper&quot; boys. Avery just can&#39;t sit still and is sleeping so much less than before.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It is also believed it could possibly be the caffeine in some goodies that <br/>\nis causing the hyper behavior. I say hyper as in meaning not sleeping or <br/>\nbeing calm like one would expect. It has been reported that food dyes have <br/>\nno affect on most children, but caffeine can.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I know that food dyes affect me, but I have crazy food alerrgies, but then I&#39;m allergic to just about everything, and we had just assumed that the boys inherited it from me, due to thier behavoir after having things that contain food dye, and i&#39;m talking about things like canned corn with colors added or mac&cheese, not candy. (oh yah, I do know what happens when you assume stuff ;-)). Also other than chocolate are their candies that contain caffine?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It has also been said that possibly it&#39;s not the sugar itself, but the food <br/>\nit comes from that can cause a change. Like sugar from corn wouldn&#39;t bother <br/>\na child but sugar from sugar beets would. Therefore it&#39;s not really the <br/>\nsugar itself but the food it came from.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmmm, very interesting, time to google.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It is also possible it&#39;s not the sugar itself again, but the lack of other <br/>\n&quot;good&quot; foods with it that has an affect. Maybe a child who has been lifted <br/>\nof being restricted will eat more candy and less protein for awhile causing <br/>\nthe change. When it balances out to where the child eats less candy and more <br/>\nprotein, as time will allow, things get back to normal.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow both boys eat very well, lots of fresh fruit and veggies, lots of good food (we are a family that enjoys cooking and eating) Although Avery will not eat meat of any kind at all. So mabey he&#39;s not getting enough protein. I&#39;ll try to watch him over the next few days, he&#39;s a grazer and doesn&#39;t eat a &quot;meal&quot; so I&#39;ll have to watch and see what he is really eating.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;,And the last one I can remember is the affect the parent themselves can have <br/>\non the children. The parents behavior affecting the outcome when the <br/>\nchildren have candy. Like saying the candy will make them not sleep and then <br/>\nof course the children don&#39;t sleep.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I have ever said this, at least not in front of the kids, but i am sure that they are picking up on my worries, and honestly as tired as i have been the last few weeks i can&#39;t vouch for anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just all things I have read and heard and tend to believe on each <br/>\naccount. Definitely food for thought. Maybe something will make sense to <br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\ncould you tell me where you have gotten your info, I&#39;d like to look in to it.

In most <br/>\n  ways it&#39;s working out fine, they almost always want it first thing in <br/>\n  the morning and they are both willing to eat anything eles in the <br/>\n  house, so they both eat really well and that&#39;s not the problem that <br/>\n  we are having. The problem is in the amount of energy increase. <br/>\n  Now, Jaiden and Avery have never been to keen on naps and they don&#39;t <br/>\n  take them at all now (they are 1 and 4) they are both very early <br/>\n  risers (5-6am) and now they are both frequently up until 11pm and <br/>\n  some nights (depending on the amount of sugar) up until well after <br/>\n  midnight. We have never inforced a bed time, although we do ask that <br/>\n  Jaiden watches movies or plays quietly in his room while I nurce <br/>\n  Avery to sleep. So, on top of the short amount of sleep we are all <br/>\n  getting (they aren&#39;t really old enough for me to go and take a nap <br/>\n  and leave them to thier own devices and going to bed before them is <br/>\n  not an option, at this point) they are so full of energy they ware me <br/>\n  out just watching them and being that i can only watch before i am <br/>\n  drafted into all of there adventures, and we have lots of them, I am <br/>\n  finding my self so tired that i&#39;m rethinking this whole candy thing. <br/>\n  I don&#39;t want to restict them but I&#39;m at the point that I can&#39;t think <br/>\n  real clear, I&#39;m so tired. So, those of you that have done this, and <br/>\n  lived to tell the tale, it will get better wont it?<br/>\n  I really need some encouragement, I know that this is a big deal to <br/>\n  them, but I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;ll make it through this period. ;-]<br/>\n<br/>\n  TIA <br/>\n  Rebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Candy was not something that Jason and I ate and was not something that we felt was good for the kids to have. Jaiden had a hard time with this because all around him kids were eating candy and he wasn&#39;t aloud to have it and it made him sad. We did buy him things like yogurt covered raisins and juice pops and he can have all the fruit he wants (it&#39;s all the artifical crap in candy and in processed foods that we don&#39;t like and that I can&#39;t eat with out getting really sick, allergys and such) but those things just wern&#39;t the same. So, once we made the decission to let him have candy we found as many natural candies that we could and bought a few of each and put them out so that the kids could pick and choose at thier will, knowing that the would be like a kid in a candy store &lt;beg&gt; for a while. Jaiden surprised us, he had a few, said he wasn&#39;t sure what all the fuss was about with the kids down stairs, could he please go get some carrots instead. Now he does eat the candy, he does like it and I do think that the sugar keeps him up a little more than normal, but he has been on the go since the day he was born and is just a very hyper kid, so I&#39;m not really as concerened about him as I am about Avery. Avery went nuts with the candy made him self sick a number of times, so we moved the candy out of his reach( but still with in Jaidens) thinking that if it wasn&#39;t right out in front of him it would be a little better. He learned how to climb real quick. So we have to keep it up. <br/>\nSo, it&#39;s been about 4 months and we don&#39;t really buy much, only when Jaiden asks or something that they love is all gone and it&#39;s been gone for a couple of weeks. Like I said though, the grandparents went nuts at X-mas so we have quite a bit of some things. <br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Do you always have candy?<br/>\nWe don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we do, it&#39;s not something they have to ask for.

There have been numerous <br/>\nstudies conducted that many parents refuse to believe. These studies suggest <br/>\nthat sugar itself has no bearing on making children hyper.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading up on these studies for years, mostly because I have some <br/>\nchildren who are sweet lovers and some who aren&#39;t. I have never seen in this <br/>\nhouse where too much sugar causes any different behavior. After seeing and <br/>\ntalking to many parents, I haven&#39;t seen a real difference either. Just my 2 <br/>\ncents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few theories as to why some parents are convinced it&#39;s the <br/>\nsugar.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is believed that when children aren&#39;t allowed the availability of candy, <br/>\nthen given free reign, it&#39;s the party atmosphere itself which lends the <br/>\nchildren to be extra happy and active. We&#39;ve all seen it at birthday parties <br/>\nwhere candy, ice cream and cake flow to children that finally have an excuse <br/>\nto eat as much as they can. Maybe just the restriction itself being lifted <br/>\nfrom not as much candy as you want to go at it, makes the difference in <br/>\nbehavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also believed it could possibly be the caffeine in some goodies that <br/>\nis causing the hyper behavior. I say hyper as in meaning not sleeping or <br/>\nbeing calm like one would expect. It has been reported that food dyes have <br/>\nno affect on most children, but caffeine can.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has also been said that possibly it&#39;s not the sugar itself, but the food <br/>\nit comes from that can cause a change. Like sugar from corn wouldn&#39;t bother <br/>\na child but sugar from sugar beets would. Therefore it&#39;s not really the <br/>\nsugar itself but the food it came from.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also possible it&#39;s not the sugar itself again, but the lack of other <br/>\n&quot;good&quot; foods with it that has an affect. Maybe a child who has been lifted <br/>\nof being restricted will eat more candy and less protein for awhile causing <br/>\nthe change. When it balances out to where the child eats less candy and more <br/>\nprotein, as time will allow, things get back to normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the last one I can remember is the affect the parent themselves can have <br/>\non the children. The parents behavior affecting the outcome when the <br/>\nchildren have candy. Like saying the candy will make them not sleep and then <br/>\nof course the children don&#39;t sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just all things I have read and heard and tend to believe on each <br/>\naccount. Definitely food for thought. Maybe something will make sense to <br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112704284,"authorName":"rebecca delong","from":"rebecca delong &lt;elfmama92104@...&gt;","profile":"elfmama92104","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] kids and candy, help please","postDate":"1042956539","msgId":55581,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMTE5MDYwODU5LjY2OTY0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjIxNTA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNiLjMyMGUwMzZmLjJiNWI2OWRjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":55576,"nextInTopic":55582,"prevInTime":55580,"nextInTime":55582,"topicId":55572,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Elissa, up until 4 months ago we didn t buy any sugry foods other than friut.

In most <br/>\n  ways it&#39;s working out fine, they almost always want it first thing in <br/>\n  the morning and they are both willing to eat anything eles in the <br/>\n  house, so they both eat really well and that&#39;s not the problem that <br/>\n  we are having. The problem is in the amount of energy increase. <br/>\n  Now, Jaiden and Avery have never been to keen on naps and they don&#39;t <br/>\n  take them at all now (they are 1 and 4) they are both very early <br/>\n  risers (5-6am) and now they are both frequently up until 11pm and <br/>\n  some nights (depending on the amount of sugar) up until well after <br/>\n  midnight.

So, on top of the short amount of sleep we are all <br/>\n  getting (they aren&#39;t really old enough for me to go and take a nap <br/>\n  and leave them to thier own devices and going to bed before them is <br/>\n  not an option, at this point) they are so full of energy they ware me <br/>\n  out just watching them and being that i can only watch before i am <br/>\n  drafted into all of there adventures, and we have lots of them, I am <br/>\n  finding my self so tired that i&#39;m rethinking this whole candy thing. <br/>\n  I don&#39;t want to restict them but I&#39;m at the point that I can&#39;t think <br/>\n  real clear, I&#39;m so tired.

It just <br/>\nseems that having candy always, making them ask but saying yes somehow misses <br/>\nbeing what people have recommended, but I can&#39;t really figure out how to say <br/>\n&quot;that&#39;s not it&quot; without it seeming goofy.

Thursday Kirby <br/>\nand Holly were getting ready to go to a Harry Potter tournament, and I had <br/>\nmade them scrambled egg sandwiches (Holly&#39;s request--two for Kirby and one <br/>\nand a half for her).  I asked if they wanted to take chips, and they wrinkled <br/>\nnoses.  I asked if they didn&#39;t want to take SOMETHING else, and I looked <br/>\naround and saw the brownies.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Brownies!?&quot; Kirby said, so I wrapped up two.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly gave hers away to someone as soon as she got there.  She said there&#39;s <br/>\nanother older boy (teen, I think, from the story) and there&#39;s a joke that she <br/>\nalways gives him food, so as soon as she walked in he asked if she brought <br/>\nhim food, and she handed him the brownie.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby had another piece of brownie the next afternoon.
