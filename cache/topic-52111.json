I bought milk and bread and a few <br/>\nother things. The kids wanted ice cream bars.. Fine, I let the get em.  Then <br/>\nJP decided he wanted an ice cream bar and a single serving soft drink.  I was <br/>\nalready buying 2 liter soft drinks ( which were the same price as a single <br/>\nserving)  I said, JP, you can chose either the ice cream or a drink, but I <br/>\ncant get both.  Well, he threw a fit.  Begged pleaded cried.. I paid for the <br/>\nitems and went on out to the van.. He threw his ice cream downa and started <br/>\ncalling me BITCH! I HATE YOU,BITCH!.   I just drove on home. He tried to grab <br/>\nme by the neck and choke me while I was driving.He grabbed my hair and yanked <br/>\nit.  He cried and screamed for about 30 mins,. calling me Bitch and  Fucking <br/>\nbitch.  ( btw, we dont use that kind of language in our home)  I put his ice <br/>\ncream in the freezer.  I tried to talk to him and explain to him that i <br/>\ncouldnt buy both items.   When he calmed down, I asked him if he wanted some <br/>\nsundrop in his own special cup. he said , yeah, and he was fine.  He has <br/>\nthese meltdowns at least once a day.  And its over the smallest thing.  Like, <br/>\nthe wrong color for his picture.  He gets mad a ME personally.  I try to <br/>\noffer suggestions, soothe him, reason with him console him.. And it is VERY <br/>\ndifficult to not lose my temper.  It upsets the other kids and he is mean and <br/>\nhateful and sometimes physically hurtful to them.  Like this morning in the <br/>\nvan with the drink incident.. He picked up a travel mug with some coffee <br/>\nstill in it andhe threw it all over Anna.  He tried to smash the bread but we <br/>\ngot it away from him.. He throws things and breaks things and basically tries <br/>\nto destry anything in his path when he goes on these rampages.   Most often <br/>\nwhat I hear is . &quot;he is just spoiled&quot;  See, I have been more lenient with <br/>\nhim. More &quot;unschooled&quot; if you will. and he has the worst temper and treatment <br/>\nof me than any of my other children.  This morning Landon said, Mom, I would <br/>\nnever dream of trying to hit you becuase I knew there would be <br/>\nconsequences...  You let him get by with too much, he shouldnt treat you like <br/>\nthat.  JP is almost like a split personality, he can be the little tyrant, <br/>\nbut 30 seconds later, be the sweetest, most loving boy youve ever met.  He IS <br/>\nvery attached to me.  Much moreso than my other children were at this age..  <br/>\nI&#39;m interested in hearing some advice  on this as well.

The fact that you dread the whole thing tells me that she gets to you at some level and she can perceive that as well. Being totally indifferent (really, inside) and very nice (diplomatic) will give her no arms and discourage her to keep &quot;poking&quot; at you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy MIL is very nice the first day, starts getting weird on the second and becomes absolutely passive aggressive by the third. But once she realizes nobody really cares about her opinion and such, she starts keeping it to herself. If she says something to my daughter Shanti  that I find inappropriate I usually whisper in Shanti&#39;s ear something like, &quot;don&#39;t pay too much attention. She doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s talking about&quot; or discuss it with Shanti later. You could discuss with your kids either before of after her arrival (or both), how they feel about the whole *visit* and facilitate a learning experience for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just asking for a bit of advice re my MIL.<br/>\n&gt; DH has invited her over from the UK to stay with us after Xmas. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; dreading the whole thing. She is a high school teacher of physics<br/>\n&gt; and thinks physics and maths is the pinnacle of academic<br/>\n&gt; acheivement. As you can imagine she doesn&#39;t approve of<br/>\n&gt; unschooling in any way, shape or form and thinks I&#39;m damaging my<br/>\n&gt; kids and depriving them of oportunities to reach their full &#39;potential&#39;<br/>\n&gt; in physics (ahem)<br/>\n&gt; When I first took the kids out of school she said it wasa good idea<br/>\n&gt; as I could then concentrate on their maths and physics as, in her<br/>\n&gt; opinion, schools don&#39;t teach physics well enough for my kids to do<br/>\n&gt; a physics degree. i did pick my jaw up from the floor and point out<br/>\n&gt; that maybe they didn&#39;t want to become physicists but she accused<br/>\n&gt; me of saying that just to be m,anipulative. So there the situation<br/>\n&gt; stands.<br/>\n&gt; She hears nothing that I say, continually &#39;tests&#39; the kids with<br/>\n&gt; questions etc etc, not respecting their rights or my opinions.<br/>\n&gt; Personally I wish she&#39;d never darken my doorstep again (she also<br/>\n&gt; goes on about my weight, my unfashionable clothes, my hair) but<br/>\n&gt; DH is eager for her to visit and she is his mother and the kids<br/>\n&gt; grandmother.<br/>\n&gt; Any tips for dealing with this ordeal (apart from duct taping her<br/>\n&gt; mouth and sticking er in the closet....)<br/>\n&gt; How have others answered relatives this thick-skinned?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shyrley<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;You laugh at me because I&#39;m different. I laugh at you because you are all the same.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\nBlue Lotus Therapeutics<br/>\nAyurveda, Homeopathy, Yoga and Therapeutic Massage.<br/>\nAsheville/Weaverville, NC<br/>\nwww.bluelotustherapeutics.com<br/>\n<br/>\nDhyanyoga Center of North Carolina<br/>\nMeditation - Kundalini Maha Yoga<br/>\nWeaverville, NC<br/>\nwww.dyc-nc.org<br/>\n<br/>\n***********************************<br/>\nWhen nothing is done, nothing is left undone.
