He has eye blinking and it&#39;s<br/>\nremained the same since he was younger.  He does not have the vocals, so I<br/>\ncan&#39;t really call it Tourette&#39;s.  A doctor noticed it when he was about 3<br/>\nand sent us to a behavior therapist, but luckily after our initial meeting<br/>\nshe was going on a three month vacation and told us to book an appointment<br/>\nwhen she got back.  We never did.  She had planned on all kinds of testing<br/>\nand then who knows what after that.  He was on Neurontin for an unrelated<br/>\nmatter and his tics completely disappeared.  He didn&#39;t need the medication<br/>\nfor the other matter anymore, so he went off it and the tics returned.  I<br/>\nwish he would stay on the Neurontin, but he is 14 and he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\ntake any medications for it.  I had transient tics when I was a kid, but<br/>\nthey&#39;re all gone now.
