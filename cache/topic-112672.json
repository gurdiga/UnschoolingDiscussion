What is the Hierarchy of Knowledge and why is<br/>\nit important?<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa VanDamme&lt;To say that knowledge is hierarchical means that there is a<br/>\nnecessary order to the acquisition of knowledge. Before you can learn<br/>\ncalculus, you must learn algebra; before you can learn algebra, you must<br/>\nknow arithmetic; before you learn arithmetic, you must grasp the concept of<br/>\na number. This fact, that knowledge&lt;to be real, meaningful knowledge&lt;must be<br/>\ngained in a specific order is generally understood in the subject of math,<br/>\nbut is woefully neglected in many other areas. The most abstract principles<br/>\nof science are taught as bolts from the blue to be memorized, with no<br/>\npresentation of the observations and intermediate principles that led to<br/>\ntheir discovery and that render them meaningful. Controversial political<br/>\nevents are discussed and analyzed when students do not have the knowledge of<br/>\nhistory that would make an informed, intelligent judgment possible. These<br/>\nrampant inversions of the hierarchy of knowledge are turning children into<br/>\npassive parrots able to recite abstract formulas&lt;and unable to think.<br/>\n<br/>\nManfred Smith&lt;Homeschoolers have the great opportunity to avoid most of the<br/>\nteaching pitfalls that we see in most schools, public or private&lt;is the<br/>\nHierarchy of Knowledge something that homeschoolers should pay particular<br/>\nattention to?<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa VanDamme&lt;If we want our children to be truly educated, to have a vast<br/>\nstore of crucial knowledge that they grasp deeply and independently, then<br/>\neducation must be radically reconceived with respect for the hierarchy of<br/>\nknowledge. Educators must ensure, at every step, that the child possesses<br/>\nthe prerequisite information to clearly understand any new item of knowledge<br/>\nfor himself. This approach cannot be found in today�s schools; any parent<br/>\nwho recognizes its crucial importance has no choice but to take his child�s<br/>\neducation into his own hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nManfred Smith&lt; There is a wide range of educational approaches in the<br/>\nhomeschool community. I can see how a parent with a more traditional<br/>\napproach would see value in the Hierarchy of Knowledge, but what would be<br/>\nthe value to a parent who follows a hands-off, discovery educational<br/>\napproach for their children?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa VanDamme&lt;I do not think such an approach is consistent with a<br/>\nhierarchical method. If a child is truly left �hands-off� to make his own<br/>\n�discovery,� he is either limited to the primitive discoveries that an<br/>\nimmature mind can make totally on his own, or he explores, without context<br/>\nor guidance, the advanced discoveries available to him in books and modern<br/>\ntechnology. In the former case, his concepts will be at such a simple level<br/>\nthat hierarchy is irrelevant; in the latter, he will necessary learn random<br/>\nfacts, formulas, theories, and ideas, out of order, without their<br/>\nfoundations&lt;and consequently will have no real knowledge at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nManfred Smith&lt;I have heard you voice criticisms of the classical educational<br/>\napproach promoted in the book, The Well Trained Mind. Many homeschoolers<br/>\nhave this book. What do you find objectionable about it, from the<br/>\nperspective of hierarchy?<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa VanDamme&lt;The Well-Trained Mind has many virtues, but much of the<br/>\ncurriculum it advocates violates the hierarchy of knowledge. One way it does<br/>\nso is in the recommendation of classic novels for children. For first<br/>\nthrough fourth-graders, for example, The Well-Trained Mind recommends, among<br/>\nother things: Gulliver�s Travels, a satirical commentary on 18th-century<br/>\nEnglish society; Victor Hugo�s Les Miserables, whose theme is, �The<br/>\ninjustice of society toward its lower classes�; and the poems of Wordsworth,<br/>\nwhich denounce selfish materialism and encourage a retreat to the simple<br/>\npurity of nature. The classics assume the cognitive context of an adult.<br/>\nThey are filled with romance, psychological insights, philosophic<br/>\nprinciples, and other content that makes them remote from the knowledge and<br/>\nexperience of a child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nManfred Smith&lt;Let me switch to another topic you will be presenting in a<br/>\nworkshop, conceptual learning.  What do you mean by �conceptual learning�?<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa VanDamme&lt;It is important, in every subject area, to stress conceptual<br/>\nunderstanding, to ensure that a child truly understands the meaning of what<br/>\nis he doing, and does not just develop a rote, automatic, ability to do it.<br/>\nIn math, for example, it is important that a child not simply memorize that<br/>\nhe must carry or borrow a number, but that he grasp what it means to carry<br/>\nor borrow a number. Certain pedagogical methods, such as requiring students<br/>\nto verbally explain their processes in math, help to promote this conceptual<br/>\nunderstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nManfred Smith&lt;You are unknown to most of the homeschooling community, at<br/>\nleast in the East.  What would you like to say to our homeschool families<br/>\nthat will encourage them to take advantage of the value you have to offer at<br/>\nour April 1 conference?<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa VanDamme&lt;In the course of homeschooling small groups of children for<br/>\nseven years, I discovered what education could be: how knowledgeable,<br/>\nthoughtful, and mature students could become in the course of their<br/>\nschooling, and how enthusiastic they could be about the process. I have<br/>\nsince translated these principles into my own �home-away-from-home-school,�<br/>\nVanDamme Academy, with astounding success. The principles of hierarchy and<br/>\nconceptual education are two of the cornerstones of this unique and<br/>\nexceptional program, and I think parents dedicated to educational<br/>\nexcellence&lt;as many homsechoolers are&lt;stand to benefit from an understanding<br/>\nof these issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nManfred Smith&lt;Thank you Lisa.  I am looking forward to your presentations<br/>\nand I�m certain that we will not be disappointed!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112612,"nextTopicId":112705}}
