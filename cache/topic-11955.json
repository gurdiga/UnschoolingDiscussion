They can learn some<br/>\n&gt; tricks and enjoy human companionship.  they rarely bite.  Don&#39;t let the<br/>\n&gt; tail bother you.  It is somewhat prehensile and a heating/cooling<br/>\n&gt; conduit.  Rats suffer a bad rap and will never recover from the whole<br/>\n&gt; bubonic thing.  Wild rats and domestic rats are 2 very different<br/>\n&gt; critters.  They have been domesticated for 100 years.  I would compare<br/>\n&gt; domestic rats to tiny little dogs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh, did I mention I have a pet rat rescue/refuge for discarded pet rats<br/>\n&gt; (g).  They are such wonderful creatures.  Definitely should not be snake<br/>\n&gt; food.  Setting them, or any other domestic small animal, free is a<br/>\n&gt; certain death sentence.  They are not wild animals and would be easy prey<br/>\n&gt; for even their own wild relatives.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shelley<br/>\n&gt; www.geocities.com/pet_rat_rescue<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And ..... to add to Shelley&#39;s great post ......<br/>\nAs the Mommy of two beige and white hooded girlie rats...
