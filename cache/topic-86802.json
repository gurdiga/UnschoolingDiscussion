First- yes, food for thought, I might have gone about it wrong- true. But, I don&#39;t think you understood-she&#39;s the OLDEST and she didn&#39;t pay ME, she paid her brothers. THe reason I choose the money route is because she cares about money. Her brothers DO give her their toys- but, thinking they will be returned within their lifetime.. When I give them their toys back, it&#39;s like Christmas to them! At any rate- yes, I will sit all three of them down, and if they say they do not mind- END IT- I will!! :) No hard feelings about what you said... THat&#39;s kinda why I wrote it- to get other&#39;s opinion if I was going at it right or what...  :)  Thanks, Pam    --- On Thu 12/25, joylyn &lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a> &gt; wrote:\r<br/>\nFrom: joylyn [mailto: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a>]To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.comDate\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.comDate</a>: Thu, 25 Dec 2003 13:23:55 -0800Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] I think it worked!!Ok, at the risk of upsetting someone else, this sounds pretty disturbing to me. I also have questions about the brother&#39;s reactions. Do they care? Do they feel as though they are being manipulative? Does it really matter if she&#39;s playing with them? It&#39;s hard to be the youngest, maybe she perceives they have all the good toys. If the two boys are OK with her coaxing the toys away, then it might be a game the kids play together. At any rate, I think that I might sit down with the three kids together and have a conversation about how this concerns you. If the three kids are all OK with the situation, then you have expressed your concerns and that should be the end of it. If the boys don&#39;t like it, then everyone needs to talk about how to deal with it differently. But I don&#39;t think making her pay you (they aren&#39;t YOUR toys) is anything but coercive.
