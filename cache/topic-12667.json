I live in St. Louis, with my<br/>\nhusband - Kevin, and our son Graham who is 3.9 y/o.  We share our home with<br/>\n2 cats as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used to joke about homeschooling, due to our personal experiences with<br/>\nthe school system (public & parochial), but I couldn&#39;t imagine doing it.<br/>\nThen I found John Holt, and I said I can do that, that&#39;s what I had needed<br/>\nmyself .<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone mentioned Waldorf, well we experimented with that before I found the<br/>\nHolt Books, I appreciate some of the ideas but it&#39;s quite dogmatic, for us<br/>\nanyway.  We do like the emphasis on nature, and the lack of any formal<br/>\nlearning til age 7 or so.  The wooden toys are a nice idea, and the slower<br/>\npace for young children fit us too.  I liked the idea of preserving the<br/>\nchild&#39;s innocence, as I was a precocious little thing, but not much fun as a<br/>\nkid.  The problem was this was much more theory, than practice at least in<br/>\nour experience.  The children were quite aggressive, and the parents were<br/>\nuh, &#39;laid back&#39; to say the least.  In one case the &#39;teacher&#39; did nothing<br/>\nwhen one child pushed my toddler son to the floor and then pulled a chair<br/>\nout from under him, but when he wanted to finally participate in circle time<br/>\nand wanted to touch a puppet , well I was told that he needed to learn to<br/>\n&#39;respect&#39;  the puppets!<br/>\nShe even wrote a note in the school newsletter, about how children who can&#39;t<br/>\nrespect puppets should go to the playground  and forgo circle time.<br/>\nNeedless to say we had already dropped out by the time someone passed that<br/>\non to me.  My son was 2 at the time.  The good news was that I gave up the<br/>\nprivate school idea for good at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other idea we did incoporate from Waldorf  was no t.v.  We almost never,<br/>\n(except for a political debate or severe weather watch) watch t.v. anymore.<br/>\nOkay,  I admit we were/will be again  Soprano junkies, got the tapes from my<br/>\nFather, watched after Graham was in bed.  Graham does see PBS, Oprah, and<br/>\nJeopardy at my parent&#39;s house on a frequent basis, so he&#39;s not totally<br/>\nculturally deprived!  It freed up a lot of time for us though, and we don&#39;t<br/>\nreally miss it, of course we didn&#39;t have cable anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell that touches on most the recent threads- so I&#39;ll stop here.  Looking<br/>\nforward to more discussions & advice from those with some experience at this<br/>\nunschooling stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy L.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12662,"nextTopicId":12668}}
