I just got my first issue and the <br/>\none past issue I requested.  And you were right Ren, Ann&#39;s <br/>\narticle, &quot;I am what I am&quot; was so good.  It made me cry and hit <br/>\nhome.  Needless to say, I stayed up until the wee hours reading <br/>\nfront to back of both issues.  I am so thankful to have this <br/>\nresource and the encouraging words of so many people.  The kids <br/>\nchose penpals from the bakc of the magazine and they wrote them <br/>\ntoday.  It is so important to make contacts ...networking is a <br/>\nmust.  Thanks all for the reommendations.<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44740,"nextTopicId":44710}}
