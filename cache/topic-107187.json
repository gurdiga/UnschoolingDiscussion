It was a set of four <br/>\nyear old twins, out of control, rude, nasty little girls, and their nine <br/>\nyear old brother (who also had his issues, but it really was about the <br/>\ntwins) Well, there was a camera running in his room, when he was sitting <br/>\ndoing his homework (because of the camera? hmmm) and the twins were being <br/>\nobnoxious as all get out, pestering him and disrupting what he was trying to <br/>\ndo. Finally, he shouted at the girls, and the mom came busting into the <br/>\nroom, shouting at HIM, for raising his voice to the twins, and then shouting <br/>\nat him some more, for talking back to her when he tried to explain.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they showed the mom that footage, you could see how appalled she was, <br/>\nin her face. The nanny was trying to get across how the older child was <br/>\nstarting to feel resentful, because he was blamed so often for altercations <br/>\nwith the twins, and the mom was denying it...and then she saw that clip.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, HeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Message: 8<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Fri, 8 Jul 2005 12:33:15 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Alan Marshall&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alanlmarshall@...\">alanlmarshall@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Supernanny article<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think this article about nanny reality shows is interesting, and some <br/>\n&gt;school issues are mentioned as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alfiekohn.org/parenting/supernanny.htm\">http://www.alfiekohn.org/parenting/supernanny.htm</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107186,"nextTopicId":107189}}
