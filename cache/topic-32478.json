Personally, I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-798750076\">I apologize if my correction of the spelling for<br/>\n&quot;grammar&quot; offended anyone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have thought about this question of what&#39;s important<br/>\nto teach.  Personally, I feel the only important thing<br/>\nto teach is that love is the law of life, that things<br/>\ngo better for the individual and everyone around<br/>\nhim/her if love is practiced on a practical level as<br/>\nhelpfulness and forgiveness, that gratitude brings<br/>\ninner peace, and that patience is built from<br/>\nforgiveness and persistence.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I find that being in the world seems to<br/>\nrequire some concession or adaptation to physical<br/>\nsurvival and cultural systems.  Even if your choice is<br/>\nmostly avoidance, that still is adaptation and<br/>\nconcession to the existence of matter and culture. <br/>\nOne of the concessions I make to our culture is<br/>\nimparting knowledge to my children, and some of the<br/>\neducational choices I make are based solely on my<br/>\ndesire to help them feel they can converse<br/>\nintelligently with all kinds of people.  That would<br/>\ninclude knowing what to call a noun and a verb, and<br/>\nbeing able to obtain a GED. My younger daughter, who<br/>\nhas tended to be very good at math but totally<br/>\ndisinterested, feels at times that she is ignorant in<br/>\ncomparison to some others around her age, and those<br/>\nare the times I put together new math workbooks or<br/>\nfind new math websites so she has the opportunity to<br/>\nkeep up with her age group as painlessly as possible. <br/>\nJust recently I presented her with &quot;All the Math<br/>\nYou&#39;ll Ever Need&quot;, a self-guided text which presents<br/>\nmath in all its practical applications.  I also <br/>\nspiral-bound a &quot;workbook&quot; of blank pages, with the<br/>\ntitle of the math book and her name on the front, so<br/>\nshe can work on it at her own pace and have a tidy<br/>\njournal for her practice problems.  She rolled her<br/>\neyes and curled her lip, but she&#39;s using it and<br/>\nletting me know when she wants help. I did point out a<br/>\ncouple of hightlights, like pi, which she had seen<br/>\nreference to in another book, and how to use algebra<br/>\nbecause &quot;x&quot; as an unknown came up in a movie we<br/>\nwatched.   <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
