Interesting stuff?What do you do with your daughter?<br/>\n  I doooon&#39;t know-she doesn&#39;t want us to look at any of them. Have agreed not to. I think it&#39;s mostly just day to day stuff but I could be wrong.  <br/>\nMostly lately what I do with her is to drive her places, to meet friends or go to her drama day camp or choir or guitar lessons. We do have good talks on these drives (9 YO is often with friends)<br/>\nWe went to a ML Baseball game where her choir sang the national anthem-a boy that she hadnt met IRL that is a friend of a friend also came, plus 9 dd and friends. I dont&#39; think she had a good time.....<br/>\nThere&#39;s not much TV we like to watch together- but one thing is who&#39;s Line Is It Anyway, so maybe I should find out when that&#39;s on so we could watch it together. <br/>\nI took her, 9dd, my mom, and two friends (kids) to Freaky Friday. <br/>\nAll the things we used to do together, like cook, care for the animals, ride the (old) horse, art stuff, she is Not interested in anymore...at all.......I miss her like crazy. I realize that might be developmental. <br/>\nAnother theme here- notice her and I didn&#39;t do anything for fun by ourselves. It seems like I&#39;m always so busy meeting other&#39;s needs that that goes by the wayside. What do you think?<br/>\nThanks for your reassurances, Betsy. I told my dh that her spelling was probably improving because of all the &#39;I M ing&#39; and he reported that all she writes is ......yeah. uh. ........one word answers....oh well. <br/>\nMary T. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] deschooling?","postDate":"1060626626","msgId":78587,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNGMzdFMEMyLjMwODAwMDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMzcwMWMzNjAyOCRkN2Y1OTRhMCQxMjA2MmE0MkBTMDAyODIwOTkxNj4="},"prevInTopic":78583,"nextInTopic":78607,"prevInTime":78586,"nextInTime":78588,"topicId":78581,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**Anyway, you guessed it, my kids now rarely choose an activity that looks remotely educational .

I have a younger kid who has been reading comic books and <br/>\ncomic strip books exclusively for more than two years.  Instead of being <br/>\nthrilled that he&#39;s spending time reading, my internalized school voices <br/>\nare rooting &quot;C&#39;mon chapter books!  chapter books!  chapter books.  Read <br/>\nthose chapeter books -- Hey!&quot;   (Sad, but true.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my funny thing to share is that he was recently reading a Foxtrot <br/>\nbook that had Roman numerals in the text (as part of movie titles) and <br/>\nhe asked me two questions and then spontaneously made me answer a couple <br/>\nof Roman numeral problems that were algebraic, and then I&#39;m thinking <br/>\n&quot;Yes!  Whoo!  Educational!  Comic strips are educational&quot;.  (But I tried <br/>\nto be cool about it, on the outside. ;-) )<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea that might help you is I recently realized that school <br/>\ncreates the expectations that the &quot;smartest&quot; kids (in terms of school <br/>\nand test smarts) SHOULD be the most successful in later life.  They may <br/>\ndangle that promise in front of kids, but it just isn&#39;t true. <br/>\nCreativity, determination and people skills are all highly important in <br/>\nmany careers and school doesn&#39;t develop these qualities.  Right now I <br/>\nthink your daughter is working on interpersonal and intrapersonal <br/>\nskills.  Does that make you feel a smidge better?<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] deschooling?","postDate":"1060623222","msgId":78583,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI4LjNjMTE5MjAxLjJjNjkyZDc2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":78581,"nextInTopic":78587,"prevInTime":78582,"nextInTime":78584,"topicId":78581,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/11/03 10:53:32 AM, berybrit@napanet.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1827540152\">In a message dated 8/11/03 10:53:32 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:berybrit@...\">berybrit@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  and I want to vent to you guys rather than having a fit with my kids and <br/>\nforcing them to......oh I don&#39;t know....be interested in something that would <br/>\nimpress adults.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood idea!

I really know the answers, I think, but would like different viewpoints/reassurance. <br/>\nSince about January we&#39;ve been unschooling and also removed most coercion, or at least tried to, from our children&#39;s lives. And I realized that although we were much more relaxed than the other families there was still a lot of subtle pressure on my kids (2 girls, 9 + 14) to always choose an &#39;educational&#39; activity. This is the way I was raised and I just didn&#39;t get natural learning until hearing Frank Smith speak and reading here. Coincidentally (bg), have been reading here since January. <br/>\nAnyway, you guessed it, my kids now rarely choose an activity that looks remotely &#39;educational&#39;.
