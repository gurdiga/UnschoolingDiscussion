He likes to see other people&#39;s reactions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *did* admit that *I* was not comfortable with it.  And I also mentioned that his girl friend&#39;s parents might not want him around their daughter if they see it.  I think he honestly hadn&#39;t thought about that.

It looks like it is getting infected anyway, and he&#39;d have to take it out for swim meets too (or get disqualified).  He left it out.  I&#39;m not sure of his reasons, and thats ok.  And if he REALLY has to have it, I won&#39;t make an issue out of it (and he knows that).  I just wanted him to know the reality of the social consequences and that I personally thinks its gross.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was ok with my feelings on it and seemed concerned about how it might reflect on me.

Then after it grew longer they stopped <br/>\nsaying anything.  Now strangers think my boys are girls.  The boys are used <br/>\nto it and just casually say &quot;no...we are boys&quot;.  A lot of people think it is <br/>\ncool and I try to point out when I see a man with long hair.  It is that in <br/>\nbetween stage when people say they need a hair cut.

Just curious how others here possibly would handle this...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 6 yo ds has decided to let his hair grow long.  My dh and I have no<br/>\nproblem with this, he lets us clean it no problem and it&#39;s his head.<br/>\nAnd probably by summer he will shave it as usual.  <br/>\nIt is amazing how many people insist on telling him he needs a hair cut!<br/>\nMy own mom who is fairly open minded has even gotten into this and has<br/>\nbrought it up several times over the past few weeks.  She suggests a<br/>\ntrim to keep it from being &quot;shaggy&quot;.  But he likes it the way it is.  I<br/>\nsee this as part of the unschooling lifestyle -- letting make his own<br/>\ndecisions about his life and body.  <br/>\nMy mom and I actually ended up having an argument about this.  I guess<br/>\nshe is concerned about how others view him..just seeing a kid that needs<br/>\na haircut.  She wants to &quot;help them see he is a beautiful boy.&quot;  But one<br/>\nof my points to her is those people are shallow and won&#39;t &quot;get &quot; it<br/>\nanyway!  <br/>\nI was very upset and angry because I regarded all of this as a power<br/>\nstruggle and also as a slight indication that she thought we weren&#39;t<br/>\nhandling this  &quot;properly&quot; or something??! She thinks she is being<br/>\nhelpful-- suggesting she take him to get the trim-- but when we didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant this help she got offended.  I think she is overstepping<br/>\nboundaries. <br/>\nI realize this may all sound trivial but again, to me it is the<br/>\nprinciple of what we are striving for here.     Any thoughts, ideas,<br/>\nsuggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks --you all have been such inspirations!  Sharon</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57863,"nextTopicId":57969}}
