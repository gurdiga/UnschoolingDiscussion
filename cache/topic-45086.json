Make sure a friend the child likes to play with is there.  Meet only as adults, when dhs can take over.  Have a way that the children don&#39;t have to interreact much; a video for instance that both like to watch.  Or two different rooms to play two different games.  Make sure the older child&#39;s room is off limits to the younger ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t usually have to be one person&#39;s way or the other...<br/>\n<br/>\nbe well,<br/>\nRachel Ann<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, October 02, 2002 9:50 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2425<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 10/2/02 1:00:32 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; My seven year old would at times get<br/>\n  quite fed up with my friend&#39;s twin four year olds and say similar things.  I<br/>\n  told him to live with it as their Mother is my friendT and they are my<br/>\n  friends and he can play in a different room if he doesn&#39;t want to be around<br/>\n  them when they are visiting.<br/>\n    &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  That&#39;s not the most sympathetic response &quot;live with it&quot; in regards to a <br/>\n  situation in which the child has very little control.<br/>\n  Is it really the end of the world to take a break from some friends for a few <br/>\n  months? In order to save a child&#39;s esteem?<br/>\n  Saying &quot;I don&#39;t like  ABC&quot; or whatever people they&#39;ve decided to announce <br/>\n  they don&#39;t like is fairly common at a young age.<br/>\n  Often it has to do with the fact that they are figuring out autonomy. They <br/>\n  can say it, so they do! I would take it seriously, but also remember it may <br/>\n  be a developmental stage in which the child is figuring out what he really <br/>\n  does and doesn&#39;t like.<br/>\n  Or that he can say powerful things.<br/>\n  But the other child should not have to suffer hurt feelings over it all the <br/>\n  time.<br/>\n  Parent&#39;s are required to put children first in this situation I believe.<br/>\n  Just as we are in a lot of situations.<br/>\n  It doesn&#39;t mean giving up our personal needs, it may mean putting them on <br/>\n  hold for the better good.<br/>\n  If a person isn&#39;t willing to give up their own needs to place a child&#39;s first <br/>\n  many, many times, they aren&#39;t ready to be parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;<br/>\n  Also, asking a child to give a reason for not liking someone can be like<br/>\n  asking for the moon.  Analyzing one&#39;s feelings is something that even adults<br/>\n  find hard&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I agree.<br/>\n  Especially if, as I mentioned above, the child is merely trying out the ways <br/>\n  in which he can wield some power.<br/>\n  Or test out reactions.<br/>\n  But I would always try to have a respectful reaction. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Ren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
