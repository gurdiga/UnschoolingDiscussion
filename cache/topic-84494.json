A <br/>\nschooled child with D&#39;s and F&#39;s who was miserable and uninvolved and who missed more <br/>\nschool than he attended (which would also mean summer school to make it up) <br/>\nOR a homeschooled child---free and happy and interested in learning (but <br/>\nwithout grades)?<br/>\n<br/>\nEasy decision for a college admissions, I would guess! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84404,"nextTopicId":84512}}
