At the first meeting I<br/>\n&gt; mentioned that we were unschoolers and got a few polite nods and<br/>\n&gt; more than a few raised eyebrows.

There are more unschoolers now than when I started, but more<br/>\nimportantly, some people in the group have become very close friends for me<br/>\nand my kids.
