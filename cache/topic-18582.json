Thinking <br/>\nhe was dreaming he closed his eyes and opened them again - she was <br/>\nstill there - and was there almost every night.<br/>\nSeveral weeks after they moved in dd was stood at the front of the <br/>\nhouse and saw this shadow go past ds bedroom window, thinking it was <br/>\nds she shouted &#39;Hello&#39; as she went into house - no answere - so she <br/>\npopped her head into room - no one there - ds was in the shower.  <br/>\nThis bedroom was always very cold.<br/>\nds was usually home from work first.  This day dd arrived home and as <br/>\nshe opened the door could here ds in kitchen as usual - but when she <br/>\nwent into kitchen there was no-one there.......<br/>\nNeedless to say they didnt stay there very long....<br/>\nMarianne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18567,"nextTopicId":18574}}
