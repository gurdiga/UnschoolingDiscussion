I am, (drum roll, please) a gardener-wanna-be. I am a bread-making<br/>\nwanna-be as well, but thats off the topic. Last year my beloved dug me a garden plt<br/>\nin the backyard, but, alas, nothing was ever planted in it, because I am a notorious<br/>\nmurderer of houseplants and outside box blooms as well, and I just didnt know the<br/>\nfirst thing about what to plant. I want desperately to plant something, anything that<br/>\nwill grow and give my kids a thrill(they vote for pumpkins) Can anyone offer the<br/>\nsimplest, easiest advice about where to start? Many thanks and blessings.<br/>\nAlso, having three daughters, the big thing around here is pretending in all its<br/>\nshapes and forms, both with dressup clothes and also toys. My mother in law<br/>\ngaace them a big trunk with dress up stuff for Christmas last year and it was a<br/>\nbig hit. They can turn any kind of action figure into an extended character for as<br/>\nlong as I don&#39;t interrupt them. They also love books, videos, and soundtracks to<br/>\nmovies they have seen, so they can put them on and act them out. I am jealous that<br/>\nthey have each other for this, when I was little, I had to be all the characters by<br/>\nmyself and it got very exhausting! (You try being the entire cast of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;) Anyway, congrats on all that and best wishes and prayers.<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\nmom to jolie, lucy and mara<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Looking for the lowest refinance rate for your mortgage?<br/>\n&gt; GetSmart.com can help.

I had to laugh because my sister is SO not a homeschooler.

Is anyone near to Mansfield, WA? My good friend lives there. I must have flunked the class where I was supposed to know the cities in<br/>\n&gt; my own state by heart. Oh well.

Did the school care?  NO.  They informed me that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unexcused absences would go on his (gasp) Permanent Record.

I find it refreshing and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reassuring.  I&#39;m a Mom at home with my own home based business and I unschooling my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; energetic, curious 5 3/4 year old son.  Whenever I have doubts I plug into this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; websight and am re-energized.  My husband is quite in favor of our &quot;schooling&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; method.  We have a large homeschooling community (82 families) here in Upper<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Michigan/Wisconsin area.  Most are traditional homeschoolers and many use a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Christian curriculum.  There are many opportunities for interaction.  The other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; families are welcoming but haven&#39;t got much of a clue to what unschooling is.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going to write an article for our local newsletter to show what a day/week is like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for us.  On Monday and Weds. afternoons I also take care of a boy who&#39;s 6 years old<br/>\n&gt; &gt; who&#39;s family is using the Sonlight curriculum.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sherry, Jack and Rowyn in Menominee, Michigan   (any Unschoolers out here?)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Accurate impartial advice on everything from laptops to table saws.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/Productopia\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/Productopia</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are 3 messages in this issue.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Topics in today&#39;s digest:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       1.

I have found that writing down just why we have chosen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this path is helpful during the rocky times.  And when I get anxious, my dh<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is often the one to tell me to relax, we&#39;re all doing a great job, the kids<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are great etc.  I think that John Anderson posted the quote from Rudyard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kipling--one worth repeating, I think:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &quot;The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by the tribe. To be your own man is hard business. If you try it, you will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the privilege of owning yourself.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Debra<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ptjlmbaldwin@...\">ptjlmbaldwin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, January 24, 2000 7:38 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] inner voice maintenance<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ptjlmbaldwin@...\">ptjlmbaldwin@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thanks for the words about both journaling and meditating.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do keep a journal sporadically, and I try to get quiet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and pray in the morning, but often worry crowds out these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important activities. Its funny, but I was so concerned<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about my husband teaching the kids about the recent eclipse,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that we almost missed actually looking at it. Ack! I guess<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my kids aren&#39;t the only ones needing a learning experience.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the positive side, our month is improving as I become<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more certain about the validity of our journey together, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appreciate the freedom to share concerns and insecure moments.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would encourage Beth(new to list and unschooling) to go back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and read some of the archives and hear some of the great<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; philosophies being shared.

My oldest Zachary is in K this year, Zane will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be 4 in March and my new darling McKenna is 7 months.  Over the past few<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; years, we have grown into raising our children with attachment parenting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (didn&#39;t start out that way but are now) and non-punative discipline.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I took last semester off after having McKenna - I wanted to be able to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give her an &quot;in-arms&quot; experience for her first 6 months.  It was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wonderful to be home.  I enjoyed it more than I thought possible.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; began to wonder if we could manage on just one income until the kids<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were school aged - now I&#39;m wondering how to go about getting my oldest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out of school and staying home to learn with them.  I began reading John<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Holt&#39;s work and have become fascinated with it.  I am no longer a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; believer in performance based learning, and long to allow my family to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grow without schooling.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I find myself rejecting more and more of our western culture and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; becoming less mainstream.  Out here, in West Texas, the atmosphere is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very conservative and structured.  I am not a church goer.  I do not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; believe in punishment of any kind.  I am becoming fairly isolated and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fear that my ideas will only take me more towards isolation.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; internet is a wonderful &quot;place&quot; to contact like-minded people, but it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not the same as having a real community.  This is something that I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; struggling with at the moment.  I do not see our society producing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people that are truly happy with their lives.  I want different for my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; family, but I wonder if it is possible to be truly happy in isolation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have any questions right now, but I&#39;m sure I will.  I will be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; resigning my position at the end of this semester and making decisions<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about homeschooling during the summer.  For now, I will be reading and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; longing for warmer weather.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; All my best,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mara<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; $20 OFF PURCHASES FOR YOUR PET AT PETOPIA.COM!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Internet Pet Paradise has everything you need to keep your pet happy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; & healthy!

I am just bursting with good news and wanted to share with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all of you folks.  For those of you who do not know it, we are in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; process of adopting from foster care.  After months of discouraging<br/>\n&gt; &gt; negative responses from Case Workers all over the country who have truned<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us down for children we were interested in, we finally have some good<br/>\n&gt; news.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We are being considered for a sister pair in Louisianna!!  We are also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; being considered for a little girl in Ohio!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have pictures and more info, but I cannot send attachments to the list,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so anyone interested in Oooohing and Aahhhing with us, just let me know!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; By the way, if either of these come through for us I will need to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; preparing a home for these girls and I need help from you experienced<br/>\n&gt; &gt; parents of girls about what kinds of things I will need for them.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; realize it depends on their personalities and interests, but what kinds<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; books, toys, games, etc do your girls like?  The sisters are 4 and 7 and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the other little girl is 8.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What kinds of things do kids these ages do for schooling?  They are<br/>\n&gt; coming<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from IS and I will probably need to begin with some structure for their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; comfort and ease out of it as they deschool and settle into the family.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also we will be dealing with attachment and placement issues, and showing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; visible schooling results to the state while the adoption finalizes.<br/>\n&gt; After<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that we can relax more.

This is a literature based<br/>\n&gt; &quot;curriculum&quot; that&#39;s not very curricular.  What you do is read some really<br/>\n&gt; good picture books several times and explore concepts in language arts,<br/>\n&gt; social studies, science and art.  I think the best ages for this are 5 and 6,<br/>\n&gt; but your potential kids could be within the range.<br/>\n&gt; (Check out the website: www.fiveinarow.com.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They do recommend supplementing Five in a Row with math and phonics<br/>\n&gt; instruction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One lesson book, covering about 20 books, or 20 weeks of lessons costs about<br/>\n&gt; $20, I think.

They play with cars<br/>\n&gt; and with dolls.  They like puzzles, blocks, balls, little animal and<br/>\n&gt; people figures, helping me, playing with bread dough.  Paper, pencil,<br/>\n&gt; pen, & marker.  We are enjoying American Girls books and dolls, Little<br/>\n&gt; House on the Prairie series, and Harry Potter.  Science experiments are<br/>\n&gt; always a hit.  Reading, reading, books on tape, listening to music, and<br/>\n&gt; dancing.  Dress-up.  Pretending!!!!<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t have boys, but it seems that most of what my girls like is<br/>\n&gt; similar to most of what boys like.  They will wrestle, but they haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; ever made weapons of anything, that I&#39;ve noticed.  They do wiggle and<br/>\n&gt; shout, sometimes act wild and other times sit still and focus.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m excited for your family, Nanci, and send many best wishes for the<br/>\n&gt; adoptions!  My brother adopted a foster child, and then his sister about<br/>\n&gt; 6 months later.  They are pre-teens now.

With unschooling everything is a learning experience.  Therefore, how can you possibly record everything your kids are learning and break it all apart into subject areas and so forth? Even if the kids kept their own journal and did it themselves, they still would miss things maybe not realizing the importance of something right now, but it may effect them later on in the process and should be accounted for. It seems like they&#39;d have to be writing all of the time, as not to miss some learning experience in order to include it in their hours to get credit for that subject area.      What do most of you have planned for the long term in ways of diplomas, GED&#39;s,  nothing?  I don&#39;t know.  In the book the author issued their own transcripts, but kept records of hours spent in certain subjects to meet the requirements for credit hours. Clonlara does this too.  What are your thoughts on this private school?  It just seems like a lot of work to figure out if the kid is meeting the credit hours or not in their unschooling.  Then again, it may help to offer some guidance if the kid knows they have to study so many hours in a particular subject any way they like, as long as they do it.

I can&#39;t remember which ones they are, I&#39;m going to have to<br/>\n&gt; look at my order form, or the package, but they are up!

OH, what a joyous day!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your urban garden sounds great! I read a wonderful article in an Organic<br/>\n&gt; Gardening mag about 3-4 years ago about some people that lived in a very<br/>\n&gt; urban area and turned their whole yard into a garden. Squash and flowers out<br/>\n&gt; front, and just a huge garden out back. One thing I remember from that<br/>\n&gt; ariticle, was that they had some pole beans growing up an old leaf rake that<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;d stuck in the ground.  :-) We are in a suburban type area, small<br/>\n&gt; house, but large lot, so we&#39;re able to have a big plot for a garden. We put<br/>\n&gt; in 10 fruit trees when we got here, which was in April of last year, cherry,<br/>\n&gt; apple, pear, plum, and peach. We are hoping to put in a couple of fig trees<br/>\n&gt; this spring.
