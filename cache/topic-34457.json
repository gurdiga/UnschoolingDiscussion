I&#39;ve been talking about <br/>\nhomeschooling with him in the same way that I talked about extended <br/>\nbreastfeeding. That is, I never come out with a banner and say &quot;THIS IS WHAT <br/>\nI BELIEVE SHOULD BE DONE!&quot; I just sort of say &quot;Hmm, I&#39;ve been wondering...&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;Well I&#39;m not sure but...&quot; etc to sort of ease him into it with <br/>\ninformation and thoughts, since he&#39;s very traditional-minded. He&#39;s been <br/>\ngreat so far -- still nursing at age 2.25 and he&#39;s very supportive of my <br/>\nhomeschool efforts/ideas. ANYWAY, I had been talking about the whole <br/>\n&#39;socialization&#39; issue and I know I&#39;ve said a few times about how school <br/>\nsocialization stinks anyway -- in the same room with the same people every <br/>\nsingle day and you get in TROUBLE for talking! :) And last night he told <br/>\n*ME* that he felt like the things I do with Benny will make him much more <br/>\ninteresting to himself and others than putting him in preschool, and went on <br/>\nto say how as he grows up he will meet more people, learn to seek <br/>\nanswers/info from more diverse sources... I mean you all know the deal -- <br/>\nbut it was just so funny and so good to hear it actually coming from him. <br/>\nAnd of course I wasn&#39;t like, &quot;Okay, based on your new belief in homeschool, <br/>\nI will now pull a 40 page contract from my hip pocket and request that you <br/>\nsign away our child&#39;s future into the hands of HOMESCHOOL INC&quot; *cackle* I <br/>\njust said, &quot;OH, that&#39;s interesting.
