It implies that familial<br/>\nrelationships are mere habit handed down from previous<br/>\ngenerations and not based on the nature of our species.<br/>\nAfter all, values can change and habits can be broken.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, it isn&#39;t traditional family values that have been<br/>\nin the revolutionary cross hairs, but the biological basis<br/>\nof the family itself. In one generation&#39;s time, popular<br/>\nsentiment toward the biological role of parents has<br/>\nreversed so completely that it is now possible for a<br/>\neditorial writer to seriously suggest that mothers who<br/>\nstay home with their children to learn and work and live<br/>\ntheir lives as a family are holding them &quot;captive.&quot;<br/>\nDespite the long history of the human race throughout<br/>\nwhich children have spent their days at their parents&#39;<br/>\nside, such an arrangement can now be called aberrant,<br/>\nisolating, prison-like.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did this happen? It wasn&#39;t via a direct attack on<br/>\nmotherhood, as any bespectacled revolutionary would know<br/>\nis impossible. Rather, other symbols were manipulated.<br/>\nThe image of the suited, executive woman dropping her<br/>\nchildren off at daycare at 6:45 am on her way to work<br/>\ncomes to mind. The image of a dozen or so pre-school<br/>\nchildren playing in a well-stocked, primary-colored<br/>\nactivities room under the watchful care of a certified<br/>\nexpert is another. The image of the homeschool mother<br/>\nis yet a third.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese three key images are the main battleground in the<br/>\nhuman familial relationship propaganda war. The revolutionaries<br/>\nhave had it all their way for 25 years or so. To most<br/>\npeople, executive mom and institutionalized pre-schooler<br/>\nhave become positive images and the homeschool mother<br/>\nhas become at best a tarnished one. But lately, some<br/>\ninconvenient facts have been tripping the revolutionaries<br/>\nup. A growing number of executive moms are realizing<br/>\nthat having a full-time career translates into being<br/>\nless than even a part time mother. A recent study hinted<br/>\nat what every stay-at-home mother knows, that children<br/>\nwho spend most of their time confined in a room with<br/>\nagemates exhibit behavior problems as a result. And an<br/>\nimpressive amount of research and anecdotal evidence<br/>\nshow that homeschooling is successful.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, the war goes on and we homeschool mothers are<br/>\nkeenly aware that it will never end. Just one year<br/>\nago, I wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n    Surely, the legislation is already written and<br/>\n    waiting for the perfect situation-a violently<br/>\n    abusive, mass murdering, crack addict of a<br/>\n    [homeschooling] parent found holdup in a house<br/>\n    with half a dozen twisted, little skeletons buried<br/>\n    in the basement. The neighbors say, &quot;They seemed<br/>\n    like a nice family, kind of quiet. Said they homeschool.<br/>\n    We had no idea...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no solace in being prophetic. Tonight, I<br/>\nsilently stood over my children, taking in their<br/>\npeaceful faces as they dreamed their pleasant dreams,<br/>\nand felt the sting of tears as I thought of what<br/>\nhappened in the Yates house that cruel morning. The<br/>\nrevolutionaries would have us believe that homeschooling<br/>\nwas the cause. So far, there have been two accusatory<br/>\neditorials and, as a result, my inbox is jammed with<br/>\nemails from homeschoolers across the country all saying<br/>\nessentially the same thing-&quot;Brace yourselves, here it<br/>\ncomes.&quot; We all knew it would.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is the measure of how thoroughly politicized our<br/>\nculture has become that the heinous crimes of one woman,<br/>\ndrugged and in abject despair, can be used to cast doubt<br/>\non the quintessential image of motherhood that is<br/>\nhomeschooling. That the sacrifices homeschool families<br/>\nmake can be perversely twisted into selfishness-or<br/>\nworse, abuse-lays plain the ferocity of the propaganda war.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs Froma Harrop&#39;s Seattle Times editorial <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/editorialsopinion/134311368_harrop28.html\">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/editorialsopinion/134311368_harrop28.html</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nan ignorant rant or excellent piece of coldly<br/>\ncalculated revolutionary propaganda? It hardly matters<br/>\nfor the effect is the same. Homeschool mothers have<br/>\nwitnessed her attack and are now on the offensive. Harrop<br/>\nis likely to get more mail in response to that one editorial<br/>\nthan she has for all her previous editorials combined,<br/>\nas the battle for image endlessly drags on.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschoolers are not deterred by bad press-we cannot<br/>\nafford the luxury. Yet every day we wonder why we are<br/>\ntrapped in this battle that we did not start and never<br/>\nwanted. Why are we demonized for sharing our lives with<br/>\nour sons and daughters? Why has mother become a political<br/>\nsymbol rather than a warm and safe apparition who checks<br/>\non children in the night, and drops a kiss on their<br/>\nforeheads as they sleep?<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy Cuthbert is a wife, mother and homeschool advocate<br/>\nwho captivates her children every day on California&#39;s<br/>\nCentral Coast.

They struggle to<br/>\nremain in an educational system that professes to care<br/>\nabout the individual child, but refuses to recognize<br/>\nindividual talents and overlooks potential individual<br/>\ngoals in the name of team effort. A principle that<br/>\nseems to have been forgotten by those in the academic<br/>\nworld is that the child is a person first and a student<br/>\nsecond. --Shirley M.R.
