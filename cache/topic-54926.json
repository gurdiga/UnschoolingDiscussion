Brit (8), her mother&#39;s<br/>\ndaughter, doesn&#39;t eat until she&#39;s been up and around for several hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrit considers green salads a treat and when we&#39;re out of lettuce that&#39;s the<br/>\nfirst thing she wants me to put on the shopping list. And she&#39;s currently<br/>\ngoing through a binge of sandwiches four times per day.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth have free access to soda, neither tend to choose it. Mikey likes water,<br/>\nboth like milk.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have asked them, and they are agreeable, to eat a multi-vitamin every day.<br/>\nThey&#39;re healthy, happy, fewer tooth problems than I had at their age.<br/>\nThere&#39;s still a lot of Christmas candy left in the bowl.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54925,"nextTopicId":54916}}
