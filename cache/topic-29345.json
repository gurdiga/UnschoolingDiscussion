Persistence is perceived in our society as a <br/>\nvirtue.  Stubbornness is not.  I certainly found my son to be a lot easier <br/>\nto understand and get along with when I changed *my* perception of his <br/>\ntoddler behavior from stubborn to persistent.  And I began to see that he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t really being stubborn, in the sense of unreasonable.  He had <br/>\nperfectly good (to himself anyway) reasons for acting the way he did in <br/>\norder to get *his* needs met.  Once I saw that, it was much easier to find <br/>\nways to help him meet his needs than when I just thought he was being <br/>\nstubborn. And I&#39;m sure he appreciated it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the two are a bit different.  I&#39;d say that persistence is my older <br/>\nson, who really wanted a particular job.  He went down there every week for <br/>\nmonths, until the boss finally told him not to bother, that he would be the <br/>\nnext person hired when they needed someone.  (And he was)  Stubborn is my <br/>\ngrandfather, who was selling life insurance in a logging camp.  Eating <br/>\nbreakfast in the mess hall, he reached for a pitcher of what he thought was <br/>\nsyrup.  He ignored the grins and snickers from the loggers and poured it <br/>\nall over his pancakes, ate the pancakes, asked for seconds, and poured the <br/>\n*olive oil* all over his second batch of pancakes and ate them, rather than <br/>\nadmitting he had goofed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We believe that even good people have faults and the<br/>\n&gt;only people who can&#39;t improve themselves are those who don&#39;t believe<br/>\n&gt;that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find that most people are *less* likely to change when their faults are <br/>\npointed out.
