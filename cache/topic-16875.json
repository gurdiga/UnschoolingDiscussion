I chose that one because it was the<br/>\nshortest. Just $22 I think. It&#39;s like a shorter version of the CAT. They<br/>\nsent it to me. I &quot;administered&quot; it to my 10 year old daughter. We mailed it<br/>\nback. They sent the results. It was much simpler than I expected. This was<br/>\nmy daughter&#39;s first test. We&#39;ve never even done worksheets, so I wondered<br/>\nhow she&#39;d do. Now I know these tests are bogus, but (since we opted to play<br/>\nthe game) it was great that she did so well. She tested at a 5th grade level<br/>\nand scored anywhere from grade 4.5 to 11.0. That really reassured the<br/>\ngrandparents---ha. So it wasn&#39;t any big deal. We&#39;re the only ones with the<br/>\ntest scores. FLO doesn&#39;t turn it into anyone else. And I&#39;m sure no one will<br/>\never ask to see them, either. I know a mom up in Edmonds with 8 kids...has a<br/>\nbox stuffed full of annual tests...and is disappointed that no one ever<br/>\nwants to see them. (she&#39;s kidding about being disappointed of course) We did<br/>\nevaluations for the 2 years prior to testing. That&#39;s great, too, depending<br/>\non who&#39;s doing it.

She lives in Canada, the book was written in 1998 and at that<br/>\ntime her youngest was 17 I think. She doesn&#39;t actually call herself an<br/>\n&#39;unschooler&#39; per se, but refers to herself as an unstructured homeschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a very gentle book that shares some hows and why&#39;s of what they did,<br/>\nthe anxieties she had, the mistakes she made, the insights she had. She also<br/>\ndiscusses the emotional component of learning, the rythm of learning. She<br/>\ntalks about what a parent can expect in terms of output. She talks about<br/>\nreading and writing and how it happened in her home with her kids<br/>\ndifferently and why she thinks it did.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a nutshell, she used her children&#39;s interests to help them gain a mastery<br/>\nof what she considered to be the skills necessary for living in the world<br/>\ntoday. She feels those skills are: being able to read fluently and with<br/>\npleasure, write fluently, understand arithmatic well enough to balance a<br/>\ncheckbook, learn how to manage money, understand basic nutrition to maintain<br/>\nhealth. learn how to pursue an idea or project and learn how to think<br/>\ncritically and imaginatively. Learning how to aquire information has been<br/>\nher focus. As Debra so eloquently put it when describing her grandmother, we<br/>\nhave no clue what our children&#39;s future will look like, and helping them<br/>\nhave the ability to figure out what they need to know is probably the best<br/>\ngift we can give them.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe did not do structured learning sessions, but she did feel it important<br/>\nthat her kids learn to read, write and do math as above - however, she<br/>\nworked with them on their time table... her kids were reading fluently<br/>\nbetween the ages of 8 1/2 to 12, depending on the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty has a nice, gentle clear way of painting a picture of what that<br/>\nlearning looked like in her house, and why it did, why it looked different<br/>\nfor each of her kids.  I have a stonger feel of how to support my children<br/>\nin their process of learning, as well as an affirmation that I&#39;m on the<br/>\nright path. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs Nance pointed out, we all waffle and wonder, have strong days and weak<br/>\nones - this book, for me at least, left me feeling stronger and clearer<br/>\nabout what the heck it is that I&#39;m doing, and what it can look like in our<br/>\nhome!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps...!<br/>\n<br/>\nNina</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Nina Sutcliffe","from":"Nina Sutcliffe &lt;ninacs@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"9X7UltMi5XP3fGBj8Z4Qa1aeTXbPXL2PteuPdoJ_7alv7UxGov5dYYSbQ4A5vDxqPHxevyJauqsycrpR43nK2TvCxsvCssRpXKNneQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1032","postDate":"984162946","msgId":16876,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI2Q0U2MjgxLjE0MyVuaW5hY3NAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk4NDExMDYyNi4yMTE5LjQ0MjI3Lmw3QHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":16875,"nextInTopic":16877,"prevInTime":16875,"nextInTime":16877,"topicId":16875,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Valerie.. thanks for your kind response - before we moved up here I went to the WHO site and discovered that I didn t have to do anything until 8... but","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2116581224\">Hi Valerie..<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for your kind response - before we moved up here I went to the WHO<br/>\nsite and discovered that I didn&#39;t have to do anything until 8... but being<br/>\nthat we moved from CA where other than sending in a form declaring our home<br/>\na private school, we don&#39;t have to do nothin&#39;, the testing part unnerved<br/>\nme...
