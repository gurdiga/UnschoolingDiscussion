Either have your supposed sources stand up<br/>\nand be counted or stuff your bs!  You are good at English, or so you say, so<br/>\nyou should know the definition of libel.  Also, just in case you didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow, being the promulgator of innuendos and gossip is actionable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually ignore you when you stoop yet once again to sophomoric behavior.<br/>\nLots of folks think you are a bag of hot air, posturing and strutting around<br/>\nplaying expert and that ignoring you would be the best way to deal with<br/>\nsomeone with National Enquirer journalistic proclivities.  Twould appear<br/>\nthat they were wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you are now attacking others, I will be more than happy to send them<br/>\nchapter and verse on where you are stepping over the legal line and how to<br/>\ndeal with you.  I hope we are real clear on this now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, you are aware that there is medication for delusional behavior and<br/>\nparanoia.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25496,"nextTopicId":25518}}
