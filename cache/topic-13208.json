I am enclosing it for your information - first is the email I<br/>\nreceived, and following that is my educated response.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE EMAIL THAT IS CIRCULATING:<br/>\nThis information is written by a Pastor... <br/>\n<br/>\nFYI Harry Potter Books? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the most evil thing I have laid my eyes ... and no one seems to<br/>\nunderstand its threat. The Harry Potter books are THE NUMBER ONE selling<br/>\nchildren&#39;s books in the nation today. Just look at any Barnes & Noble or<br/>\nWaldenbook storefront. Go to Amazon.com and read the reviews. Hear the<br/>\ntouting by educators and even Christian teachers about how &quot;It&#39;s great to<br/>\nsee the youth so eagerly embracing the reading experience!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHarry Potter is the creation of a former UK English teacher who promotes<br/>\nwitchcraft and Satanism. Harry is a 13 year old &#39;wizard.&#39; Her creation<br/>\nopenly blasphemes Jesus and God and promotes sorcery, seeking revenge upon<br/>\nanyone who upsets them by giving you examples (even the sources with<br/>\nauthors and titles!) of spells, rituals, and demonic powers. It is the<br/>\ndoorway for children to enter the Dark Side of evil. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the problem is that parents have not reviewed the material. The<br/>\nname seems harmless enough... Harry Potter. But that is where it all ends. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me give you a few quotes from some of the influenced readers<br/>\nthemselves:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Harry Potter books are cool, &#39;cause they teach you all about magic and<br/>\nhow you can use it to  control people and get revenge on your enemies,&quot;<br/>\nsaid Hartland, WI, 10-year-old Craig Nowell, a recent convert to the New<br/>\nSatanic Order Of The Black Circle. &quot;I want to learn the Cruciatus Curse, to<br/>\nmake my muggle science teacher suffer for giving me a D.&quot; [A &#39;muggle&#39; is an<br/>\nunbeliever of magic.] <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOr how about the REALLY young and innocent impressionable mind of a 6 year<br/>\nold when asked about her favorite character: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hermione is my favorite, because she&#39;s smart and has a kitty,&quot; said<br/>\n6-year-old Jessica Lehman of Easley, SC. &quot;Jesus died because He was weak<br/>\nand stupid.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here is dear Ashley, a 9 year old, the typical average age reader of<br/>\nHarry Potter:  &quot;I used to believe in what they taught us at Sunday School,&quot;<br/>\nsaid Ashley, conjuring up an ancient spell to  summon Cerebus, the<br/>\nthree-headed hound of hell. &quot;But the Harry Potter books showed me that<br/>\nmagic is  real, something I can learn and use right now, and that the Bible<br/>\nis nothing but boring lies.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDOES THIS GET YOUR ATTENTION!! If not, how about a quote from a High Priest<br/>\nof Satanism: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Harry is an absolute godsend to our cause,&quot; said High Priest Egan of the<br/>\nFirst Church Of Satan in Salem, MA. &quot;An organization like ours thrives on<br/>\nnew blood - no pun intended - and we&#39;ve had more applicants than we can<br/>\nhandle lately. And, of course, practically all of them are virgins, which<br/>\nis gravy.&quot; [Since 1995, open applicants to Satan worship has increased from<br/>\naround 100,000 to now...  14 MILLION children and young adults!] <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes me physically ill, people! But, I think I can offer you an<br/>\nexplanation of why this is happening. Children have been  bombarded with<br/>\naction, adventure, thrills and scares to the point Hollywood can produce<br/>\nnothing new to give them the next &#39;high.&#39; Parents have neglected to see<br/>\nwhat their children are reading and doing, and simply seem satisfied that<br/>\n&#39;Little Johnny is interested in reading.&#39; AND... educators and the NEA are<br/>\nPUSHING this crap with NO WARNING as to the effects or the contents. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStill not convinced? I will leave you with something to let you make up<br/>\nyour own mind. First the URL to read some background of what I have given<br/>\nyou: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theonion.com/onion3625/harry_potter.html\">http://theonion.com/onion3625/harry_potter.html</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theonion.com/onion3625/harry_potter.html\">http://theonion.com/onion3625/harry_potter.html</a>&gt;  ( Harry Potter Books<br/>\nSpark Rise In Satanism Among Children ) Click on this site to see children<br/>\nfrom Winter Park. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, a quote from the author herself, J. K. Rowling, describing the<br/>\nobjections of Christian reviewers to her writings: &quot;I think it&#39;s absolute<br/>\nrubbish to protest children&#39;s books on the grounds that they are  luring<br/>\nchildren to Satan,&quot; Rowling told a London Times reporter in a July 17<br/>\ninterview. &quot;People should be praising them for that! These books guide<br/>\nchildren to an understanding that<br/>\nthe weak, idiotic Son Of God is a living hoax who will be humiliated when<br/>\nthe rain of fire comes,... while we, his faithful servants, laugh and<br/>\ncavort in victory.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hope is that you will see fit to become involved in getting the word out<br/>\nabout this garbage. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease FWD to every pastor, teacher, and parent you know. This author has<br/>\nnow published FOUR BOOKS in less than 2 years of this &#39;encyclopedia of<br/>\nSatanism&#39; and is surely going to write more. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTHIS IS MY RESPONSE:<br/>\n <br/>\nI must admit, I was quite dismayed to have received the recent email<br/>\nregarding Harry Potter. It was, at the least, loaded with nothing but<br/>\nopinions (mostly those of children), and at the most a most despicable lie.<br/>\n I am a Christian, educated (college degree), protective mother, and an<br/>\navowed Harry Potter fan.  As such, I would like to fill you in on some<br/>\nfacts.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Most disturbing about the email was the &quot;quote&quot; by JK Rowling.  The<br/>\nemail only contained part of the complete (disgusting) quote posted at the<br/>\nwebsite link included.  This quote is 100% fabricated and a lie - there was<br/>\nno interview with JK Rowling in the month of July in the London Times<br/>\nnewspaper. She did not say these things, they are total lies to make people<br/>\nbelieve something that is not true.  <br/>\n <br/>\n2) The only response I have read that JK has made in regards to the lack of<br/>\nChristianity in her books is &quot;then don&#39;t read them.&quot; If you truly believe<br/>\nyou want to read only books that talk about and honor Jesus, then these<br/>\nbooks are not for you. But never once in any of the books is Jesus or God<br/>\nmentioned in either a negative or a positive light.  It is simply not an<br/>\nissue.  Conversely, however, there is no worship of Satan either. These are<br/>\na bunch of kids going to school. In the wizarding world, there is a very<br/>\nbad demon, and they do try and keep him &quot;out of power,&quot; but that is the<br/>\nextent of any true &quot;power&quot; issues.  In fact, the following review can be<br/>\nfound on Amazon.com:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From Beliefnet <br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are some Christians who view these two activities as a<br/>\ncontradiction--who think that Hogwarts is worse than hogwash, and that the<br/>\nmagical scenarios of J.K. Rowling&#39;s imagination are inherently<br/>\nun-Christian. I would counter that, instead, these books have the potential<br/>\nto be profoundly Christian if readers can see past the medium (magic) to<br/>\nthe novels&#39; deeper messages about self-sacrifice, the triumph of good over<br/>\nevil, and the glorious possibility of human redemption. (Beliefnet, July<br/>\n2000) <br/>\n<br/>\n3) To quote a group of children about their impressions of Harry Potter<br/>\nwould be to question the mindless millions that watch Nickelodeon channel<br/>\nwithout the guidance of their parents, or listen to various rock groups<br/>\nwhose lyrics are not acceptable as opposed to the ones that are - they are<br/>\ngoing to get out of it what they want to, based on their moral upbringing<br/>\nand their parental guidance!  This is a case of parents who neglect to give<br/>\ntheir children a good moral upbringing, to learn right from wrong, and to<br/>\nbe well-adjusted human beings. I hardly think the parents of the child who<br/>\nsaid that &quot;Jesus died because He was weak and stupid&quot; are strong<br/>\nChristians, nor have they raised their child to follow in Jesus&#39; footsteps.<br/>\nWhen Nickelodeon channel is watched WITH your children, or music listened<br/>\nto and discussed WITH your children, you can interpret it together, guide<br/>\nthem, and learn from it.  If you allow them to be mindlessly led by it, you<br/>\nare leaving it up to their own interpretation, which generally they are too<br/>\nimmature to properly make.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) The quote from the High Priest Egan of the Satanic church - do you<br/>\nreally believe he would say &quot;practically all of them are virgins, which is<br/>\ngravy?&quot;  Do you really think he would say that? And besides, what does this<br/>\nhave to do with Harry Potter? This is more a sign of our times - after all,<br/>\nprayer isn&#39;t allowed in schools any more, remember? The TV shows about<br/>\nvampires and evil characters, the scary movies, the rock groups that<br/>\npromote &quot;evil&quot; - none of those have anything to do with the increase in<br/>\ninvolvement in Satanic cults, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n5) MANY, MANY educators, Christian and non-Christian, are praising the<br/>\nHarry Potter books because they are so well-written, interesting and fun<br/>\nthat they have encouraged millions of children to read!  These children,<br/>\nmany of whom never had an interest in reading before, are not only reading<br/>\nthe Potter books, but anything they can get their hands on.  The reading<br/>\nlevel of these books is at least that of a high school level - even my<br/>\nhusband had difficulty with the vocabulary and grammar. Think about it - a<br/>\ncraze in America led strictly by a book!  Not a TV show, or a movie, or<br/>\neven driven by commercialism - just simply a book!  It&#39;s unheard of in our<br/>\nrecent cultural history!  Yes, unfortunately the commercialism will follow,<br/>\nbut for now, they have nothing but a book.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) The &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;wizardry&quot; in these books is very simple, and mostly<br/>\nquite harmless.  They are not incantations recited in a foreign language,<br/>\nthey are one word commands for things like illuminating their wand, etc. <br/>\nThe higher magic comes in only during the fight of good vs. evil, which is<br/>\nvery black and white here. There are the bad guys and the good guys, and<br/>\nit&#39;s pretty obvious which are which.  There is no devil worship. The email<br/>\nindicates that the books lists spells and cites sources with authors and<br/>\nbook titles.  Hello people - this is fiction! There are no such books -<br/>\nthese are fictional books that JK Rowling has made up as part of a story!  <br/>\nAnd do keep this in mind - it is just a book, a work of fiction!<br/>\n<br/>\n7) Censorship - this country was founded on people looking for freedom! The<br/>\nfreedom to make their own decisions about their lives, not have the<br/>\ngovernment tell them what to believe, how to worship, and what to read! <br/>\nCensorship is tantamount to communism, and ESPECIALLY as homeschoolers,<br/>\nshould be one of our biggest fears in life! This is why we homeschool -<br/>\nbecause we don&#39;t want to go along with the masses, we question the norm,<br/>\nand make our own decisions!<br/>\n<br/>\n8) Harry Potter himself is an EXCELLENT role model for children!  He is<br/>\ntotally un-self-centered, generous, thinks nothing of putting himself in<br/>\ndanger for the sake of his friends, is a good student, and other than being<br/>\na procrastinator (as shown mildly in book #4), has no other major faults! I<br/>\nhave no problem with my children emulating Harry! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat concerns me most here is the fact that the people who initiated this<br/>\nemail are ignorant of the Harry Potter books - they obviously have not read<br/>\nthem, have not quoted reliable sources, and have made up actual lies.  And<br/>\nthese lies are being spread to people like you and other parents who have<br/>\nnot read the books.  I know of no intelligent person who has read the books<br/>\n(whether they personally liked them or not) that think they are EVIL. <br/>\nBefore we go and help the authors of these ignorant emails by spreading<br/>\ntheir word, we need to research and investigate the topic in further<br/>\ndetail. Otherwise, other parents might be influenced to a degree that they<br/>\nnot allow their children to read these books. If the parents themselves<br/>\nhave personally read the books and come to the decision that they prefer<br/>\ntheir children not read the books, then I truly and utterly respect their<br/>\ndecision - they are the parents and it is their decision.  However, if the<br/>\nparents have not read the books, they will be led by the &quot;recommendations&quot;<br/>\nof these crackpots, and then I think it&#39;s a shame and a loss for all<br/>\nconcerned.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease forward THIS email to every pastor, teacher and parent you know.<br/>\nRobin Norell</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"84YMrPKe5hu6_4j6a6V21wrYGodihFtAMVp9CBPtFksHte1izp9HMCXRMfGnNoUeTiU33LPIbwVd","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Harry Potter warning","postDate":"969214801","msgId":13210,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk2LjliYjkzOTguMjZmNjY1NTFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":13209,"nextInTopic":13211,"prevInTime":13209,"nextInTime":13211,"topicId":13208,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 00-09-17 10:14:08 EDT, rnorell@localnet.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1038527671\">In a message dated 00-09-17 10:14:08 EDT, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rnorell@...\">rnorell@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Still not convinced?

Harry is a 13 year old &#39;wizard.&#39; Her creation \nopenly blasphemes Jesus and God and promotes sorcery, seeking revenge upon \nanyone who upsets them by giving you examples (even the sources with authors and \ntitles!) of spells, rituals, and demonic powers. It is the doorway for children \nto enter the Dark Side of evil. <br><br><br>I think the problem is that parents \nhave not reviewed the material. The name seems harmless enough... Harry Potter. \nBut that is where it all ends. <br><br><br>Let me give you a few quotes from \nsome of the influenced readers themselves:<br><br>&quot;The Harry Potter books are \ncool, &#39;cause they teach you all about magic and how you can use it to&nbsp; \ncontrol people and get revenge on your enemies,&quot; said Hartland, WI, 10-year-old \nCraig Nowell, a recent&nbsp;convert to the New Satanic Order Of The Black \nCircle. &quot;I want to learn the Cruciatus Curse, to make my&nbsp;muggle science \nteacher suffer for giving me a D.&quot; [A &#39;muggle&#39; is an&nbsp;unbeliever of magic.] \n<br><br><br>Or how about the REALLY young and innocent impressionable mind of a \n6 year old when asked about her&nbsp;favorite character: <br><br><br>&quot;Hermione \nis my favorite, because she&#39;s smart and has a kitty,&quot; said 6-year-old Jessica \nLehman of Easley, SC. &quot;Jesus died because He was weak and stupid.&quot; \n<br><br><br>And here is dear Ashley, a 9 year old, the typical average age \nreader of Harry Potter:&nbsp; &quot;I used to believe in what they taught us at \nSunday School,&quot; said Ashley, conjuring up an ancient spell to&nbsp; summon \nCerebus, the three-headed hound of hell. &quot;But the Harry Potter books showed me \nthat magic is&nbsp; real, something I can learn and use right now, and that the \nBible is nothing but boring lies.&quot; <br><br><br>DOES THIS GET YOUR ATTENTION!! \nIf not, how about a quote from a High Priest of Satanism: <br><br><br>&quot;Harry is \nan absolute godsend to our cause,&quot; said High Priest Egan of the First Church Of \nSatan in&nbsp;Salem, MA. &quot;An organization like ours thrives on new blood - no \npun intended - and we&#39;ve had more&nbsp;applicants than we can handle lately. \nAnd, of course, practically all of them are virgins, which is&nbsp;gravy.&quot; \n[Since 1995, open applicants to Satan worship has increased from around 100,000 \nto now...&nbsp; 14 MILLION children and young adults!] <br><br><br>It makes me \nphysically ill, people! But, I think I can offer you an explanation of why this \nis happening. Children have been&nbsp; bombarded with action, adventure, thrills \nand scares to the point Hollywood can produce nothing new to give them the next \n&#39;high.&#39; Parents have neglected to see what their children are reading and doing, \nand simply seem satisfied that &#39;Little Johnny is interested in reading.&#39; AND... \neducators and the NEA are PUSHING this crap with NO WARNING as to the effects or \nthe contents. <br><br><br>Still not convinced?

K. Rowling, describing the objections of Christian reviewers to her \nwritings: &quot;I think it&#39;s absolute rubbish to protest children&#39;s books on the \ngrounds that they are&nbsp; luring children to Satan,&quot; Rowling told a London \nTimes reporter in a July 17 interview. &quot;People should be&nbsp;praising them for \nthat! These books guide children to an understanding that<br>the weak, idiotic \nSon Of&nbsp;God is a living hoax who will be humiliated when the rain of fire \ncomes,... while we, his faithful&nbsp;servants, laugh and cavort in victory.&quot; \n<br><br><br>My hope is that you will see fit to become involved in getting the \nword out about this garbage. <br><br>Please FWD to every pastor, teacher, and \nparent you know. This author has now published FOUR BOOKS in&nbsp;less than 2 \nyears of this &#39;encyclopedia of Satanism&#39; and is surely going to write more. \n<br><br><br></font></div></font>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\"><br>THIS IS MY RESPONSE:</font></div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">I must admit, I was quite dismayed to have \nreceived the recent email regarding Harry Potter. It was, at the least, loaded \nwith nothing but opinions (mostly those of children), and at the most a most \ndespicable lie.&nbsp; I am a Christian, educated (college degree), protective \nmother, and an avowed Harry Potter fan.&nbsp; As such, I would like to fill you \nin on some facts.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">1) Most disturbing about the email was the \n&quot;quote&quot; by JK Rowling.&nbsp; The email only contained part of the complete \n(disgusting) quote posted at the website link&nbsp;included.&nbsp; This quote is \n100% fabricated and a lie - there was no interview with JK Rowling in the month \nof July in the London Times newspaper. She did not say these things, they are \ntotal lies to make people believe something that is not true.&nbsp; \n</font></div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">2) The only response I have read that JK has \nmade in regards to the lack of Christianity in her books is &quot;then don&#39;t read \nthem.&quot; If you truly believe you want to read only books that talk about and \nhonor Jesus, then these books are not for you. But never once in any of the \nbooks is Jesus or God mentioned in either a negative or a positive light.&nbsp; \nIt is simply not an issue.&nbsp; Conversely, however, there is no worship of \nSatan either. These are a bunch of kids going to school. In the wizarding world, \nthere is a very bad demon, and they do try and keep him &quot;out of power,&quot; but that \nis the extent of any true &quot;power&quot; issues.&nbsp; In fact, the following review \ncan be found on Amazon.com:</font></div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"verdana,arial,helvetica\"\n size=\"-1\"><b><i><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/46980\">From Beliefnet</a> \n</i></b><br></font>There are some Christians who view these two activities as a \ncontradiction--who think that Hogwarts is worse than hogwash, and that the \nmagical scenarios of J.K. Rowling&#39;s imagination are inherently un-Christian. I \nwould counter that, instead, these books have the potential to be profoundly \nChristian if readers can see past the medium (magic) to the novels&#39; deeper \nmessages about self-sacrifice, the triumph of good over evil, and the glorious \npossibility of human redemption. (Beliefnet, July 2000) </font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">3) To quote a group of children about their \nimpressions of Harry Potter would be to question the mindless millions that \nwatch Nickelodeon channel without the guidance of their parents, or listen to \nvarious rock groups&nbsp;whose lyrics are not acceptable as opposed to the ones \nthat are - they are going to get out of it what they want to, based on their \nmoral upbringing and their parental guidance!&nbsp; This is a case of parents \nwho neglect to give their children a good moral upbringing, to learn right from \nwrong, and to&nbsp;be well-adjusted human beings. I hardly think the parents of \nthe child who said that &quot;Jesus died because He was weak and stupid&quot; are strong \nChristians, nor have they raised their child to follow in Jesus&#39; footsteps. When \nNickelodeon channel is watched WITH your children, or music listened to and \ndiscussed WITH your children, you can interpret it together, guide them, and \nlearn from it.&nbsp; If you allow them to be mindlessly led by it, you are \nleaving it up to their own interpretation, which generally they are too immature \nto properly make.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">4) The quote from the High Priest Egan of the \nSatanic church - do you really believe he would say &quot;practically all of them are \nvirgins, which is gravy?&quot;&nbsp; Do you really think he would say that? And \nbesides, what does this have to do with Harry Potter? This is more a sign of our \ntimes - after all, prayer isn&#39;t allowed in schools any more, remember? The TV \nshows about vampires and evil characters, the scary movies, the&nbsp;rock groups \nthat promote &quot;evil&quot; - none of those have anything to do with the increase in \ninvolvement in Satanic cults, right?</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">5) MANY, MANY educators, Christian and \nnon-Christian, are praising the Harry Potter books because they are so \nwell-written, interesting and fun that they have encouraged millions of children \nto read!&nbsp; These children, many of whom never had an interest in reading \nbefore, are not only reading the Potter books, but anything they can get their \nhands on.&nbsp; The reading level of these books is at least that of a high \nschool level - even my husband had difficulty with the vocabulary and grammar. \nThink about it - a craze in America led strictly by a book!&nbsp; Not a TV show, \nor a movie, or even driven by commercialism - just simply a book!&nbsp; It&#39;s \nunheard of in our recent cultural history!&nbsp; Yes, unfortunately the \ncommercialism will follow, but for now, they have nothing but a \nbook.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">6) The &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;wizardry&quot; in these books is \nvery simple, and mostly quite harmless.&nbsp; They are not incantations recited \nin a foreign language, they are one word commands for things like illuminating \ntheir wand, etc.&nbsp; The higher magic comes in only during the fight of good \nvs. evil, which is very black and white here. There are the bad guys and the \ngood guys, and it&#39;s pretty obvious which are which.&nbsp; There is no devil \nworship. The email indicates that the books lists spells and cites sources with \nauthors and book titles.&nbsp; Hello people - this is fiction! There are no such \nbooks - these are fictional books that JK Rowling has made up as part of a \nstory!&nbsp;&nbsp; And do keep this in mind - it is just a book, a work of \nfiction!</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">7) Censorship - this country was founded on \npeople looking for freedom! The freedom to make their own decisions about their \nlives, not have the government tell them what to believe, how to worship, and \nwhat to read!&nbsp; Censorship is tantamount to communism, and ESPECIALLY as \nhomeschoolers, should be one of our biggest fears in life! This is why we \nhomeschool - because we don&#39;t want to go along with the masses, we question the \nnorm, and make our own decisions!</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">8) Harry Potter himself is an EXCELLENT role \nmodel for children!&nbsp; He is totally un-self-centered, generous, thinks \nnothing of putting himself in danger for the sake of his friends, is a good \nstudent, and other than being a procrastinator (as shown mildly in book #4), has \nno other major faults! I have no problem with my children emulating Harry! \n</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">What concerns me most here is the fact that the \npeople who initiated this email are ignorant of the Harry Potter books - they \nobviously have not read them, have not quoted reliable sources, and have made up \nactual lies.&nbsp; And these lies are being spread to people like you&nbsp;and \nother parents who have not read the books.&nbsp; I know of no intelligent person \nwho has read the books (whether they personally liked them or not) that think \nthey are EVIL.&nbsp; Before we go and help the authors of these ignorant emails \nby spreading their word, we need to research and investigate the topic in \nfurther detail. Otherwise, other parents might be influenced to a degree that \nthey not allow their children to read these books. If the parents themselves \nhave personally read the books and come to the decision that they prefer their \nchildren not read the books, then I truly and utterly respect their decision - \nthey are the parents and it is their decision.&nbsp; However, if the parents \nhave not read the books, they will be led by&nbsp;the &quot;recommendations&quot; of these \ncrackpots, and then I think it&#39;s a shame and a loss for all \nconcerned.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">Please forward THIS email to every pastor, \nteacher and parent you know.</font></div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">Robin \nNorell</font></div><br></font></div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13234,"nextTopicId":13238}}
