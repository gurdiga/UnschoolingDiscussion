The book is <br/>\ncalled &quot;When Elephants Weep.&quot;  Here is a link to a review:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bookloons.com/Database/NonFiction_Review_of_When_Elephants_Weep_by_Masson.html\">http://www.bookloons.com/Database/NonFiction_Review_of_When_Elephants_Weep_by_Masson.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;***Animals don&#39;t make decisions about reproduction.

They need <br/>\n&gt;us to &quot;make reproductive decisions&quot; for them.***<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps animals don&#39;t make decisions about reproduction from *our* <br/>\nperspective, but they certainly do from theirs. I would not want to say <br/>\nwith certainty whether animals can or cannot think about anything.  I also <br/>\nthink that &quot;promiscuity&quot; is a very judgmental term that we cannot lay on <br/>\nanimals, whose reasons for being are completely their own. If we could get <br/>\nourselves inside the heads of animals, we may be quite surprised to find <br/>\nout exactly what kinds of &quot;feelings&quot; and &quot;emotions&quot; they have.  We may not <br/>\nbe able to recognize them because they may be very different than what <br/>\nhumans&#39; feelings and emotions look like. But, that does not mean that <br/>\nanimals are not sentient or have no consciousness.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L then wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Sandra&#39;s point what that in the past we have enslaved others and made<br/>\n&gt;these decisions for them, for our convenience, and our conditioning of<br/>\n&gt;what is decent and moral has changed considerably since then.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There may come a time when the domestication and enslavement of animals<br/>\n&gt;and their treatment is called into question and the practices we have<br/>\n&gt;today are regarded with the same horror we now have at our former<br/>\n&gt;morality.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I could be wrong, but I think that time has come now, perhaps not <br/>\nuniversally, but in some quarters these things are definitely being called <br/>\ninto question.  I have noticed that people can become very angry and <br/>\ndefensive when animal rights issues are brought up (i.e. at circus <br/>\ndemonstrations, which I frequently attend whenever I can), and, again I <br/>\ncould be way off, but I think there may be a correlation with our <br/>\ndiscomfort with an idea and the idea&#39;s proximity to truth.
