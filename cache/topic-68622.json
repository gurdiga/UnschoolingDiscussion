Her <br/>\nsun school teacher asked &quot;Is Jesus more like Mr. Rogers or <br/>\nBraveheart?&quot; and they came to the conclusion that He is like both. <br/>\nBut the question was about this stereotype we have of what Mr. Rogers <br/>\nis like.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy memory of him is that he never talked down to his audience. Just <br/>\nspoke directly to them, in a friendly and direct manner. He had some <br/>\nroutines that he did every time, and a simple way of make-believing. <br/>\nAnd there was always some interesting grown-up in his neighborhood, <br/>\nto learn something from. My mom remembers me as a toddler, sitting <br/>\nstill and watching intently with Mr. Rogers, but other TV programs <br/>\nnot keeping my attention at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like his style. He seems to have been a person who respected <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; <br/>\n&lt;jmcseals@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I found this quite interesting.
