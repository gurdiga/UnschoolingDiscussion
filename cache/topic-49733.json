Now <br/>\nthis is a kid who usually can&#39;t do without her chicken every night. She&#39;s a <br/>\ngood eater, but tonight I guess was a bread night!! I don&#39;t worry at all <br/>\nabout what the kids eat during the day. I&#39;m with them and see that it evens <br/>\nout. Sometimes not in a week, but it does. My son goes through periods of <br/>\nliking just one thing for a long time. It use to be PB & J sandwiches. Then <br/>\nit was cheese sandwiches. Then it was chips and sour cream. Each one would <br/>\nlast months. Now he&#39;s into chicken all of a sudden. He never eats meat <br/>\nexcept for my meatballs in sauce. And the cheese is back again, but without <br/>\nbread.<br/>\n<br/>\nI swear that my oldest for years lived on pizza, sauce and macaroni, <br/>\nbutter/garlic macaroni, PB & J, french fries, dry cereal and pancakes. This <br/>\nlasted from about the age of 3 until she was about 14! She did add fast food <br/>\nchicken in there along the way. Now she&#39;ll even have steak and eat veggies <br/>\nand soup and salad. It&#39;s amazing it&#39;s the same kid. Dont sweat it, Tara is <br/>\nliving proof it all works out. She&#39;s healthier than the majority of kids I <br/>\nknow.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.
