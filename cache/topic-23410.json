While out and about one day he made me stop so he could read the<br/>\nletters on a sign I asked him if he&#39;d like it if he had signs at home to<br/>\nread.  He excitedly yelled &quot;Yes!&quot; and we went and got strips of sturdy paper<br/>\nat a teacher supply store and went home.  I asked him what he wanted me to<br/>\nwrite on his &quot;sign&quot; and the paper were different colors so he handed me a<br/>\nyellow one and said &quot;draw yellow&quot;, so I wrote Yellow on it.  He did it for<br/>\neach color.  Then he said he wanted one for fireplace and I wrote fireplace,<br/>\nasked him where he wanted it, and he took it to the fireplace.  He continued<br/>\nuntil our home looked like a preschool :).  door, toilet, oven, microwave,<br/>\ncloset, garage, cabinet, clock, dishwasher, drawer, bookcase, desk,<br/>\ncomputer, television....<br/>\nHe loved to be able to go around and read the letters off of everything and<br/>\nknow what the words were.  A few months later (he was about 2 years, 3<br/>\nmonths) he spelled his first word.  We were driving and he saw a building<br/>\nwith a D on it, he said &quot;door has a D in it&quot; and I said yes it does.  He<br/>\nthen said &quot;D-o-o-r says door&quot;.<br/>\nA few months after that we went to a park and on the structure it says &quot;Play<br/>\nsafe&quot;.  As we were walking towards it he said &quot;I know that word! It says<br/>\nplay!&quot; That wasn&#39;t a word we had up, and after about a week of me trying to<br/>\nfigure out how he learned it I finally figured it out - the VCR!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, labeling can be fun.  We&#39;ve taken all of ours down for now, right<br/>\nnow we have the solar system up in our living room instead, per Julian&#39;s<br/>\nrequet :) If he asks again we&#39;ll put more up, it did make for a lot of fun,<br/>\nand quick and easy distraction while I would cook dinner or do dishes.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kristi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freeform@...\">freeform@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freeform@...\">freeform@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, August 18, 2001 10:05 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1368<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sat, 18 Aug 2001 11:32:06 EDT <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RValvo7626@...\">RValvo7626@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She also writes in mirror image alot.

There is no point<br/>\nin repeatedly reading a book she doesn&#39;t request to<br/>\nhear over and over - but maybe if you tried a few<br/>\npredictable print books she may take to that. Here are<br/>\na few suggestions: Brown Bear Brown Bear What Do You<br/>\nSee & Polar Bear Polar Bear What Do You Hear (both by<br/>\nBill Martin Jr.), The Very Hungry Caterpillar & The<br/>\nGrouchy Lady Bug (both by Eric Carle), Pumpkin Pumpkin<br/>\nby Jeanne Titherington, If I Had by Mercer Mayer, But<br/>\nNot The Hippopotamus by Sandra Boynton, Cat On The Mat<br/>\nby Brian Wildssmith, or Growning Colors by Bruce<br/>\nMcMillan. (Frog and Toad books would be almost<br/>\nimpossible first (*by*) readers - although they&#39;re<br/>\ngreat to read *to* her. The books suggested have very<br/>\nfew words and the the pictures give enought cues that<br/>\nyour daughter will probably be reading them herself<br/>\nafter only a few readings by you. This was not the<br/>\nmethod I used to teach my older children.  They<br/>\nlearned in school using phonics and all read as little<br/>\nas possible.  This is something learned after it was<br/>\ntoo late to help them, but this is what I&#39;m doing with<br/>\nmy youngest.)<br/>\nMichele<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!

When she first started, the clues were<br/>\nthings like &quot;bed&quot;, then on the bed, there would be a card that said &quot;cat&quot;<br/>\n(which only works if you have cats like ours who rarely move), then by<br/>\nthe cat it might say &quot;tub&quot;... and as she got to be a more proficient<br/>\nreader it would be more like, &quot;Look on mom&#39;s bed&quot; or &quot;Look under the milk<br/>\njug&quot;... and later still I got into mysterious clues, like &quot;This is the<br/>\nplace where books should be, When on their way to the library&quot;.
