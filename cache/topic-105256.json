You all have given me so much to think about, don&#39;t be <br/>\nsurprised if you don&#39;t hear from me for awhile as I&#39;ve got some <br/>\nthinking to do. A month ago, maybe not even that long ago, I began <br/>\nresearching homeschooling. The precipitating cause for this was that <br/>\nI&#39;d just learned that my 15 year old cousin who lives a few blocks <br/>\naway is addicted to heroin and left school for a rehab clinic. I <br/>\nread with great satisfaction of the various benefits to <br/>\nhomeschooling. I also was amazed at the myriad choices of styles and <br/>\nphilosophies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I became enamored with unschooling. Learning from living just <br/>\nseemed to make sense and jived with my experience. So I began to <br/>\nread more about unschooling. I read about what doesn&#39;t work in &quot;Why <br/>\nChildren Fail,&quot; and am about to start &quot;Teach Your Own.&quot; So then I <br/>\nopened my big mouth and came in here and several other places <br/>\nseeking some encouragement that I might share with my wife. Big <br/>\nmistake. Now I&#39;m the one feeling overwhelmed as I read about Taking <br/>\nChildren Seriously, Non-Violent Communication, Principles vs. Rules, <br/>\nnot using diapers?!?!<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not arguing with you folks. Truth be told, <br/>\nI&#39;d be afraid to. :) It&#39;s just such a culture shock to consider my <br/>\nchildren as autonomous. But I&#39;m definitely intrigued and plan to do <br/>\neven more reading. Long ago my wife and I had a discussion where we <br/>\ntalked about what we wanted for our children as adults, and we <br/>\nagreed that above all else we wanted them to be happy, truly happy. <br/>\nNow perhaps some will argue that I&#39;m being coercive with even the <br/>\nnotion of wanting something for my kids, but I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s true. I <br/>\nwant them to be happy, content adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I may be all replyed out for awhile, as you folks have really <br/>\ngiven me so much to think about. For that I&#39;m thankful. I&#39;m not <br/>\nagainst the thought of a paradigm shift. If I can handle announcing <br/>\nmy atheism to my family after 10 years of Christian school, and four <br/>\nyears of Christian college, I can handle telling them we&#39;re trying <br/>\nnon coercive parenting. I just want to look into this some more and <br/>\ncontinue to lurk and read your responses to others with questions <br/>\nsimilar to my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve already checked my local library to see if they have &quot;Joyfully <br/>\nLiving with Children&quot; (they do not) and/or &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; <br/>\n(they do & I&#39;ve requested it).

We know one<br/>\nrelaxed homeschooling family in the area (we are radical unschoolers)<br/>\nand I know of unschoolers in my state through online connections, but<br/>\nwe honestly *don&#39;t* do any regularly scheduled playdates, park days,<br/>\nfield trips, etc.  We get together with neighborhood kids and see<br/>\nfriends sometimes (my son and I share some adult friends, and he has a<br/>\nfew &quot;small people&quot; friends, too, almost all schooled).  But it&#39;s<br/>\nreally not that often.  We can easily go for a few days at a time<br/>\nwithout going out or seeing people.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy does this work for us?  Why am I not stark raving mad from<br/>\nisolation?  Why is my son not bored to tears everyday?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps that we&#39;re somewhat introverted people, and we really enjoy<br/>\nthe company of each other and ourselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also think that life is actually that interesting.  Days create<br/>\ntheir own rhythms.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLately our days have consisted of a few different parts:  time when<br/>\nwe&#39;re very interactive with each other and engaged in an intensive<br/>\nactivity (usually pretend Pokemon battles, where we write down all our<br/>\nattacks and try to see how they play out against each other); time<br/>\nwhen we&#39;re talking casually and our play is flowing from one thing to<br/>\nanother -- playing ball, birdwatching, swinging, dissecting leaves<br/>\nwith a toy hammer &lt;g&gt;; and time in which we&#39;re near each other,<br/>\nchecking in verbally every few minutes, but basically doing our own<br/>\nthing (my son is watching TV and telling me which parts he loves while<br/>\nI type this).<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this variety and more, even on a day when we&#39;re &quot;just&quot; staying<br/>\nhome.  This rhythm itself will ebb and flow and morph into something<br/>\ndifferent, and then morph back again, over the months.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can sense when we need a change of scenery or company, and we are<br/>\nopen to outside opportunities that match our interests.  But we<br/>\nrespond to that need when it arises, instead of wearing ourselves out<br/>\nplanning and running because we&#39;re worried about &quot;achieving learning<br/>\nobjectives.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your family has more extraverted needs, then putting time into<br/>\n&quot;field trips&quot; and relationships with other homeschoolers may be a<br/>\npriority.  But before I started *actually* unschooling, I had pretty<br/>\nunrealistic expectations of what I would &quot;need&quot; to do.  That&#39;s why I<br/>\nbring it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would really focus on is knowing your daughter and letting her<br/>\nlead whenever possible.

There are 2 (were 3) homeschooling families in my neighborhood.  We don&#39;t spend any time with them because they differ too much from us in religious and educational beliefs.  Besides, they don&#39;t finish their &quot;homeschooling day&quot; until the middle of the afternoon, shortly before the school kids arrive home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the benefits of having unschooling (or relaxed homeschooling) friends is that they are likely to be available during &quot;school days&quot; for spending time together.  Schooled friends and home&quot;schooled&quot; friends are not available for big chunks of time because of their school (time spent in school and time spent doing homework).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen dd was kindergarten age, some of her neighborhood friends were a year younger and even the kindergarten ones were &quot;only&quot; gone for a few hours.  Plus, I was still involved in La Leche League which offered regular parenting support along with play groups.  It happened that several of the LLL leaders were homeschooling and they invited me to come to a meeting of a new homeschool support group when my oldest was 4.  Several of the families had young children (babies to age 8 or so) and several of us hit it off and wanted to do stuff together.  So I literally had a homeschool group even before I was officially homeschooling.  It was a diverse group whose members ran the gamut from secular school at home to atheist or non-Christian religion eclectic, relaxed, and unschoolers.  So my children have had homeschooling friends since the beginning, which helps to balance the interactions they have with their neighborhood schooled friends.  One of the original families is still amongst our best friends, and there are others who we continue to have casual contact with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if it&#39;s relevant that we moved here when my oldest was 3 1/2.  I had attended mom/infant classes in my old town and stayed with the program until we moved during the month of March.  At that time, I was doing a co-op preschool with dd one day a week.  It was a really great program.  Parents were allowed to stay at the preschool (parents were also required to volunteer, so there were always at least 5 or 6 adults present) and the kids had free range except for beginning and ending circle time and snack time.  The teacher encouraged parents to follow the child&#39;s lead in choice of activities each week, even if the child spent most of their time at only one or two activities.  As a parent, the program offered me child development theories and ideas for fun learning activities.  When we moved, I decided not to look for another preschool because by then I had a second child and did not want to put one child in child care in order to be at a co-op preschool with the other.  The co-op had been a great experience so I did not even consider looking for a &quot;drop-off&quot; preschool program.  Also, dd at the time was generally reluctant to stay anywhere without me.  So, when she was ages 3-4, I first started thinking about the idea that while preschool can be a fun thing for some kids/parents, it is not an essential thing for children.  Now I think it can be damaging for some children too, but I was in a different space back then.  I was capable of providing the same sorts of activities for my child on my own and our new community had/has lots to offer for families with young children.  It was easy to find things to do and other young families to do them with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I mean, did it matter to the kids that they were with other home schoolers or was it just important to be with other kids.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Since we&#39;ve always known other homeschoolers IRL, and live in a stable neighborhood with many good friends (who now go to school), I can&#39;t know what it would have been like otherwise.  My kids have always had lots of other children around, though certainly not all day everyday.  But I think in some ways it matters more to at least know of other unschoolers as the child reaches middle/high school years.  It&#39;s nice to know real young people who are learning, thriving, and doing interesting things outside of and without school and teaching.  My oldest would be in 6th grade this year - first year of middle school here.  There is an awful lot of excitement generated by the kids who are off on this adventure of school lockers and school dances and buying your lunch ala carte in the school cafeteria and etcetera.  Most of them don&#39;t have the choice to stay home, so they make the best of it and find ways to have what fun they can.  I think it has been nice for my dd to have homeschooling friends to do things with and not feel so alone while the other kids are &quot;enjoying&quot; middle school.  Of course Lisa has also been able to find out from her schooled friends that it is not all fun.  Just about every one of them has at least once said they wished they could homeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thought, as my children (and I) are growing and learning, I&#39;m finding that friends are based far more on common interests and personality compatibility than on educational methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100122184,"authorName":"Lisa M.

I also stay at home while dh works.  I <br/>\nwas thinking that perhaps your wife is feeling ambivalent because she <br/>\nisn&#39;t sure she can meet the needs of both of your children now that one <br/>\nof them is school aged -- I say this because it&#39;s something I sometimes <br/>\nhave doubts about.  Am I shortchanging dd1 when she wants to go to the <br/>\nArboretum, but it&#39;s time for dd2&#39;s nap?  I feel guilty that I can&#39;t <br/>\nread as many chapters of &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot; as dd1 would <br/>\nlike because dd2 needs me to play with her, too.  I think it&#39;s a <br/>\nnatural part of parenting more than one child, but when you take on the <br/>\nadded responsibility of educating your children yourself, rather than <br/>\npassing that onto the school system, it can seem overwhelming - not <br/>\nonly do you have the guilt that you are not meeting their emotional <br/>\nneeds, but added on to that is the feeling that now you&#39;re also <br/>\nneglecting their education!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps me to focus on how much time I do spend with dd1, how much we <br/>\ndo get to do together each day, and it is getting easier and easier to <br/>\ninclude dd2 in a lot of things as she is getting older and more <br/>\ninterested in the same things as dd1.  It also helps me to look at how <br/>\nmuch learning dd1 does on her own -- watching TV, playing, creating, <br/>\ninteracting with the things in her environment (including some things I <br/>\nnever would have suspected would have been such a rich source of <br/>\nlearning for her -- yesterday, she found an old bag of walnuts in their <br/>\nshells left over from Christmas.  She started out by painting them with <br/>\nwatercolors, then they became color coded food for her different Barbie <br/>\nFairytopia dolls, then they were eggs out of which were going to hatch <br/>\nnew baby fairies, then they were money she used to play pet store, then <br/>\nshe tried cracking them with a nutcracker and then a lobster hammer, <br/>\nand finally, she put the nut meats in a hollowed out rock to leave on <br/>\nher toy shelf in case she or her sister got hungry later.  I mean, you <br/>\ncan&#39;t buy this kind of experience at the most expensive private <br/>\nkindergarten in the country!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as friends go, so far all of our friends have been <br/>\nnon-homeschoolers we&#39;ve met in our neighborhood and through a weekly <br/>\nplaygroup we attend.  Since these children will all be attending school <br/>\neventually, I&#39;ve had it in the back of my mind that we need to connect <br/>\nwith some homeschooling families soon.  Luckily for us, there are lots <br/>\nof homeschoolers in our area, and we&#39;ve begun attending a monthly <br/>\ngathering of homeschooling parents and children which focuses on <br/>\ntextile arts -- knitting, spinning, weaving, etc.  It&#39;s an avid <br/>\ninterest of mine, so I really enjoy it, while the kids love getting <br/>\ntogether with other kids.  Some people do textile projects, others play <br/>\nand socialize, most do a bit of both, and everyone&#39;s happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor field trips and such, we do a lot of things on the weekends, when <br/>\ndh is around.  We go to fairs, expos, on picnics, fishing, on hikes and <br/>\nwalks and drives -- I can&#39;t stress enough how important it is to have <br/>\nhim participate as much as he does.  He often takes dd1 with him on <br/>\n&quot;expeditions&quot; to Home Depot, the sawmill, the feed store, the tractor <br/>\nstore, livestock auctions, and he&#39;s looking forward to including dd2 <br/>\nnow that she&#39;s showing some interest in going along without me.  That <br/>\nwill give me some alone time with baby #3, and it&#39;s so good for the <br/>\nolder girls to have that special time with their dad.  During the week, <br/>\nI take them everywhere with me -- the bank, the grocery store, the post <br/>\noffice, etc. and we go to a playgroup on Wednesdays, have a <br/>\nlong-standing playdate with another family on Thursdays, go to the <br/>\nlibrary one day.

Here I  am, 10 years <br/>\nlater.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nI was thinking of another reason your wife may be resisting.  Maybe  she&#39;s <br/>\nnot resisting homeschooling at all, but the idea that you&#39;re so adamant  about <br/>\nit.  Maybe it makes her feel &quot;kept&quot; in some inarticulate way.  I  don&#39;t want to <br/>\nuse the word &quot;trapped&quot;, but maybe she was looking forward to time  to breathe <br/>\nwhile your daughter is at school.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s completely okay to feel that way!  I need alone time quite  regularly.  <br/>\nI need time when no one is talking to me and when I feel no one  is *about* to <br/>\ntalk to me.  I feel very psychologically connected to the  energy of others <br/>\nin my house, and I need to disconnect once in a while.   Maybe your wife feels <br/>\nthe same way (and maybe doesn&#39;t realize it, yet), and  needs reassurance that <br/>\nshe&#39;ll be able to disconnect sometimes, too.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI think it&#39;s worth exploring together.  It doesn&#39;t mean she doesn&#39;t  love her <br/>\ndaughter or anything like that.  Being connected to a  dependent human 24/7 <br/>\nis difficult for some of us.  It&#39;s difficult for  me.  I recognize it and make <br/>\nspace for myself.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s so rare for a man to &quot;get&quot; unschooling right away.

I&#39;m advocating an unschooling approach especially since<br/>\nit&#39;s Kindergarten and she&#39;d only be missing story time, singing and<br/>\ncrafts, which we&#39;ve been doing at home all along anyway, and will<br/>\ncontinue to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has decided that she would prefer a more structured approach,<br/>\nyet she also claims to be feeling overwhelmed at the thought of<br/>\nhomeschooling. I countered that the feeling of being overwhelmed is<br/>\nlikely at least in part due to her considering this structured<br/>\napproach and all that it will entail day to day. I said that she<br/>\ncould just allow our daughter to live and enjoy the day-to-day with<br/>\nher mommy and her baby brother... that she will learn all sorts of<br/>\nvaluable insights from the every day experiences of living.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think she thinks that unschoolers are running from museums, to<br/>\nfarms, and from nature preserves to senior homes, etc. I told her<br/>\nthat while I think that these things are done, they certainly aren&#39;t<br/>\ndone every day and perhaps not even once a week, and that our<br/>\ndaughter will learn while shopping with Mommy; by talking with the<br/>\nboth of us; by playing with her little brother; by playing by<br/>\nherself; exploring our back yard; looking at books; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, my wife isn&#39;t against the idea, but I think she is very<br/>\noverwhelmed imagining all sorts of requirements on her that I keep<br/>\nasserting won&#39;t really be there at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m requesting a pep talk so to speak from as many of you who are<br/>\non the front line as are willing to respond.
