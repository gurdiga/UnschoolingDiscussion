I consider my soon to be 4 yr old son a pre-reader. He, however, is constantly asking what signs says, etc, etc. When we go to the library we go to the sections which contain his INTERESTS not his reading skills. When he was interested in mummies we got out books (usually at middle school level) on mummies, ditto on bones, volcanoes, minerals, cars, trains, dinosaurs, etc, etc. I have learned more about these subjects than I ever have cared to know...but you know what so has he---it has quenched his need to know about those subjects for awhile. Why keeps books around that don&#39;t have interesting stories or topics??
