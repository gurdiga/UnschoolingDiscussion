I <br/>\nhave a special needs child who went to Early Intervention for two years, <br/>\nrecieved therapies at a local rehabilitation facility, and is followed by <br/>\nMH/MR.  So although I&#39;m trying to fly under the radar, they know we&#39;re out <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n  I just read in an autism newsletter that someone in a town a few miles from <br/>\nme had a child taken away for, among other things, locking her child in.  <br/>\nANYONE with the slightest knowledge of these kids know that many of them feel <br/>\ncompelled to run.  Just last year an online friend lost her 10 year old son <br/>\nto drowning when he searched out the keys, unlocked the door and got out.  <br/>\n(The point of this paragraph is to point out that you can say &quot;don&#39;t worry, <br/>\nthey can&#39;t take your kid away&quot; when the reality can be very different.  Even <br/>\nwhen WE know what we&#39;re doing is in the child&#39;s best interests.)  <br/>\n  Virginia, I&#39;m wishing for you the strength to see this through.<br/>\nBest Wishes,<br/>\nMary J<br/>\nPS   the woman whose child was taken fought it, and her child was returned<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44461,"nextTopicId":44519}}
