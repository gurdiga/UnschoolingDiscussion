I registered my kids as 7 year <br/>\nold first graders (there is legal conflict between the compulsory <br/>\nattendance age of 5 and kindergarten as an optional grade) so the 11th <br/>\ngrade test will be optional, as they&#39;ll be more than 16 (end of <br/>\ncompulsory attendance) when considered 11th graders.  My current plan is <br/>\nto register them only on testing years, so the school district knows to <br/>\norder a test for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is easy, as I keep a calendar of our activities should <br/>\nanyone ask about our 176 days of attendance; Hannah just took the 2nd <br/>\ngrade test last spring, as a baseline, so *showing improvement* is not <br/>\nyet a concern for us.  We are able to test in our own homes on our own <br/>\ntime (within the 6 week window set by the school district -- moot if one <br/>\npurchases their own tests).  Hannah actually thought it was fun, though <br/>\nshe was glad to only take two parts of the 12 part test.
