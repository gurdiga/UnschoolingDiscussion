We have one in BC that we&#39;ve been using for years.  The first 2<br/>\nyears there was absolutely no monitoring.  During the second year, the<br/>\ngovernment decided that if they were funding this thing they wanted &quot;proof&quot;<br/>\nthat the kids were learning.  The way it was handled, though, unschoolers<br/>\ncould still function.  You could send in anecdotal reports about what your<br/>\nkids were doing rather than having to make them do certain things.  This<br/>\nyear, it&#39;s changed again.  The government decided for some weird reason to<br/>\nfund them the same as regular public schools (even though their costs are<br/>\nless) but they want more proof.  I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll stay on next year.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been doing ok this year, but that&#39;s because Lars is on an IEP and we<br/>\ncan still do basically what we want.  Even so, I think they&#39;ll want more<br/>\nnext year.  But the government has also started funding private school cyber<br/>\nschool programs (half funding, like most private schools in the province)<br/>\nand there&#39;s one we might go with.  Wondertree has always been as close to<br/>\nunschooling as possible, like a Sudbury school.  They&#39;ve worked out ways to<br/>\n&quot;prove&quot; learning without interfering with what the kids are actually doing.<br/>\nI&#39;m looking into it.  But we&#39;ve had the use of a computer all these years<br/>\nthat we wouldn&#39;t have had without the cyber school.  I think we&#39;ve gotten<br/>\nsome value for our taxes.<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128897139,"authorName":"love-it-here@juno.com","from":"love-it-here@...","profile":"wendes2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Cyber Schools/Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Digest Number 3014","postDate":"1044894432","msgId":58418,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMjEwLjExMjcxNC4tMzQ2OTY3LjEubG92ZS1pdC1oZXJlQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58417,"nextInTopic":58434,"prevInTime":58417,"nextInTime":58419,"topicId":58333,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Mon, 10 Feb 2003 07:36:39 -0800 (PST) Kelli Traaseth ...
