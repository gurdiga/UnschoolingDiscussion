At that age, we&#39;d be snuggled as you describe, face to face, <br/>\nand I&#39;d wrap my arms around and slowly &quot;walk&quot; my fingertips down his <br/>\nback, pressing gently with all fingertips then moving down a bit and <br/>\npressing again, on both sides of his spine, especially in the area <br/>\nbetween the shoulder blades. One good thing about a foot rub is that <br/>\nthe recipient is going anywhere because you&#39;ve got their feet in <br/>\nyour hands. DS is 7 now and still requests back and foot rubs when <br/>\nhe needs help unwinding - and I&#39;ll still offer them when it looks <br/>\nlike he needs to unwind. He has different &quot;Settings&quot; now - snow (a <br/>\nsmoothing type motion), rain (fingertip pat like raindrops), etc.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201436708,"authorName":"arcarpenter2003","from":"&quot;arcarpenter2003&quot; &lt;arcarpenter@...&gt;","profile":"arcarpenter2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 5385","postDate":"1120713198","msgId":107164,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRhaWRsZSs0OHBkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFjNC4yYjc4YzM0Ny4yZmY3ZWZlZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":107093,"nextInTopic":107169,"prevInTime":107163,"nextInTime":107165,"topicId":107093,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ==Is it possible to turn the lighting down a bit more?

Riley, after nursing and lying there for a few<br/>\nminutes, will be perched on my chest, pressing his face hard into mine<br/>\nand smiling.  This will be after low lights for a while, PJs, some<br/>\nnice lavender lotion on his body, watching some Baby Einstein, etc. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not every night, but when it happens, that&#39;s when I know he wants<br/>\nto go to sleep, but his &quot;active-ness&quot; hasn&#39;t left his body yet<br/>\n(overall he is a *very* active and intense 2 y.o.).  That&#39;s what I<br/>\nmean by attending to his sensory needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we do lately is he lies on top of me in bed while I hold him<br/>\ntight and I rock him side to side with both my arms and my body.  It&#39;s<br/>\na pretty hard rocking, but the pressure and the rhythm of it allows<br/>\nhim to finally release and relax enough to get to sleep.  It&#39;s also<br/>\nreally pleasant and snuggly and comforting for both of us. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone also mentioned naps, and I agree that I have to watch those. <br/>\nHe still falls asleep easily in the afternoon, and it doesn&#39;t work to<br/>\ntry to skip his nap.  But if he sleeps too long or too late, he&#39;ll be<br/>\nup until 12 or 1 a.m., and then up again at 7 or 8.  Not enough sleep<br/>\nfor Mama! &lt;g&gt;  So it works to start being noisy at a certain point in<br/>\nhis nap -- 2 hours or less. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOur situation is certainly working for us, but I also have to pay much<br/>\nmore attention to helping Riley sleep than I ever did for Fisher, our<br/>\n8 y.o. son.  I don&#39;t mind having to do so -- it&#39;s just interesting and<br/>\na bit surprising for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Digest Number 5385","postDate":"1120310767","msgId":107093,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjNC4yYjc4YzM0Ny4yZmY3ZWZlZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":107164,"prevInTime":107092,"nextInTime":107094,"topicId":107093,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-220775032\">&lt;&lt;The problem I was describing in my earlier post is that my 2  year old<br/>\nwill nurse, lie there for a while, and then pop up and want to  play,<br/>\nroll over us, etc.  *That&#39;s* when I bring in the sensory stuff  --<br/>\nsomething to help him release the awake. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I feel better now  that I&#39;ve clarified. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy&gt;&gt;<br/>\n***************<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy,<br/>\nOur children are 13,5,3 and 1<br/>\nWe co-sleep also with our 1 and 3 yr old.
