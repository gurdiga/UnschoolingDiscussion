It&#39;s been an ideal<br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; solution in our house.  [Reminder: my children are ages 15,<br/>\n13, and almost 9.]<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral years ago, my older 2 children were watching a lot of TV (or so it<br/>\nseemed to me).  I sat down with them and together we figured out how many<br/>\nhours per day, week, month, and year they were spending watching TV.  (When<br/>\nwe found the yearly figure, it added up to be quite a lot, even though they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t watch as much as most kids.)  We subtracted hours for sleeping, and<br/>\ncame up with a number of full days they were spending watching TV.  (It was<br/>\nastounding.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we all made a list of fun things to do--go to the zoo, take a walk,<br/>\nplay board games, to to museums, ride bikes, etc.  Then we looked at the<br/>\nlist of &quot;fun&quot; things to do and figured up how much time we could be spending<br/>\ndoing more interesting things than watching TV.  And then we vowed to do the<br/>\ninteresting things.  We talked about how much time THEY wanted to spend<br/>\nwatching TV in a day and which time THEY would rather spend doing more<br/>\ninteresting (to them) things.  And we talked about what shows they liked<br/>\nbest and which ones they watched because they were on.  Then for a while<br/>\nafter that, when I&#39;d catch them watching TV (particularly something that I<br/>\nthought was pretty &quot;mindless&quot; or that they had agreed wasn&#39;t interesting),<br/>\nI&#39;d just ask them (not accuse them) if there was something more interesting<br/>\nthey&#39;d rather be doing.  Almost always they decided there WAS and they&#39;d (or<br/>\nwe&#39;d) go do it.  If they said, &quot;no&quot; then I&#39;d accept that, too.  And during<br/>\nthe discussion, I did ask if it was OK with them that I reminded them of<br/>\ntheir decision; they said they would like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t a lecture.  I didn&#39;t even really PLAN it.  I hadn&#39;t even<br/>\npre-figured out what the total hours were--it was just as much a surprise to<br/>\nme as it was to them.  We just had a discussion about what THEY valued.<br/>\nThis exercise helped THEM clarify THEIR value systems--not to impose mine on<br/>\nthem.  (Though, personally, I don&#39;t have a philosophical problem about<br/>\n*trying* to pass along my own values....however, I realize it&#39;s *easiest* if<br/>\nI&#39;m working *with* and respecting theirs; not against them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did make an effort to spend more time doing some interesting things, too,<br/>\nlike going to the zoo more often, to the park, spending time outside, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow my older two don&#39;t watch much TV at all, and almost never &quot;mindlessly&quot;<br/>\nanymore (i.e. out of boredom).  My oldest will ONLY watch decidedly<br/>\n&quot;educational&quot; shows (on Discovery, TLC, and The History Channel, for<br/>\nexample).  My youngest child is a real TV &quot;addict&quot;, however, and it&#39;s<br/>\nprobably time to have the same sort of discussion with her.  However, she&#39;s<br/>\nalso very active and has lots of other interests and a great imagination.<br/>\n(I don&#39;t see TV affecting her the same way it seemed to affect the older<br/>\nkids.)  And she really never has watched TV &quot;mindlessly&quot;.  She moves almost<br/>\nconstantly while she&#39;s watching (doing dance steps, gymnastics, etc.) and<br/>\nremembers so much of what she watches.  She doesn&#39;t &quot;zone out&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this solution worked for us in that it wasn&#39;t ME imposing rules on<br/>\nthem, but them learning important life skills about setting goals,<br/>\nclarifying their values and priorities, self-discipline, etc.  I just acted<br/>\nas facilitator of the process.  I didn&#39;t make TV &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; to them,<br/>\nbut just one more menu choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s what works for us,<br/>\nLeslie Moyer / Oklahoma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":89240901,"authorName":"Alan Moorehead","from":"Alan Moorehead &lt;groundhoggirl@...&gt;","profile":"groundhoggirl2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] even finer?","postDate":"1009908067","msgId":30528,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMTAxMTc1OS5nMDFIeGhtYTAxMTQxN0BzbTEzLnRleGFzLnJyLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PFBHRUZKT0JOTklDRUJKSEpLUEtQS0VLTkNJQUEuTGVzbGllTW95ZXJAZ2VvdGVjLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":30527,"nextInTopic":30532,"prevInTime":30527,"nextInTime":30529,"topicId":30519,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If anything, from what I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; seen, watching TV makes people a bit more willing to lay back and relax.<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone else think that?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Annette<br/>\n&gt; ================<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Annette,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry, but I would like to respectfully disagree with you.  What you <br/>\nwrote really hit a nerve with me.  I don&#39;t like the idea of anyone <br/>\njudging me according to how hard I work.  How hard I work is no one&#39;s <br/>\nbusiness but my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, perhaps what you consider to be work, I consider to be play, or <br/>\nvice versa.  Who is to decide what is &quot;work&quot; in the first place.  One of <br/>\nthe reasons I choose to unschool is so we can try and eliminate that <br/>\ndivision between play and work.  I try to just live my life and do what <br/>\nis necessary in the most relaxed way possible.  I am trying to pass this <br/>\non to my children.  This is one of the big reasons why we have an <br/>\nunschooling lifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one has the right to decide who is a hard worker and who is not.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t like the idea of someone imposing his/her values upon me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink twice before you judge someone in this regard.  Maybe the person <br/>\ncan&#39;t &quot;work hard&quot;, in your eyes, because of a mental illness, or s/he <br/>\nhas sick children and is under an enormous amount of stress and is <br/>\neasily overwhelmed, or maybe this person just plain doesn&#39;t like to do <br/>\nwhat you think is &quot;work&quot; - maybe s/he has other priorities, like <br/>\nspending time with his/her children.  Maybe what is important to you is <br/>\nnot important to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the reason I don&#39;t rake my back yard FULL of leaves ever week is <br/>\nbecause I love to rake leaves and I&#39;m letting it build up so I can enjoy <br/>\nmany hours of raking leaves all at one time.  I love creating a huge <br/>\nmountain of leaf bags  in front of my house.  Right now there are 55 <br/>\nbags of leaves in front of my house.  I&#39;ve had a lot of fun doing it <br/>\ntoo.  My neighbor next door has for a couple of months now given us <br/>\ndirty looks about the state of our back yard.  I choose to work <br/>\ndifferently than he does.  I like to do it all at once.  I&#39;m not lazy.  <br/>\nWe&#39;re just different.  When I was back there raking all those leaves I <br/>\nwas having loads of fun.  I suspect my neighbor probably thought I was <br/>\nfinally getting around to doing some really unpleasant work.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone is different and no one should try and judge what, why, when or <br/>\nhow other people do things.  We should just try to treat each other <br/>\nrespectfully, with kindness and  accept everyone&#39;s differences.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

Maybe it&#39;s the other way around, people who want to lay back<br/>\nand relax turn the TV on.  Chicken or egg, again, methinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m reminded of a friend I had years ago.  She had come here recently<br/>\nfrom Hong Kong.  She was always telling me how she thought Americans<br/>\nwere different then Chinese people.  Americans worked their job, so she<br/>\nsaid,  and then went home and watched TV and on the weekend looked for<br/>\nways to have fun, picnics, outings, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nChinese (she said) go home and do their second job during the evenings<br/>\nand weekends.  Now, she wasn&#39;t struggling financially by any means.<br/>\nProgrammer by day and when I knew her, she was starting an import/export<br/>\nbusiness to trade with China during the evenings and weekends.<br/>\nPreviously, she&#39;d been running a restaurant in her spare time.  Last I<br/>\nheard, by the way, she&#39;d quit her programming job and was in China<br/>\nhelping to eastablish their first ice cream factories.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point was she never watched TV but I don&#39;t think that was the key.<br/>\nIt was the attitude.  I probably, no make that I definitely, use the<br/>\ncomputer like others use TV.  Doesn&#39;t make me any more productive in my<br/>\nlife than any TV watcher but I do enjoy it more.  I think people who get<br/>\nreal busy doing what they do don&#39;t have a lot of time to lay back and<br/>\nrelax and, hopefully, they love what they&#39;re doing.  Maybe that&#39;s the<br/>\nkey.
