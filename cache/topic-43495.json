We came back from the AMNH and Central Park. We went <br/>\nlooking for dioramas of volcanos but ended up looking at dinosaurs <br/>\nbecause the kids found the Earth gallery much too scary --isn&#39;t that <br/>\nweird? They are not freaked out by a 3 stories-high skeleton but will <br/>\nfreak by igneous rocks. I do have to say that it was because the <br/>\ngallery was dark and it had this deep, low, humming sound that WAS <br/>\nkinda creepy. Noises, not images will freak out Evan more these days. <br/>\nEven though I hope it will pass, it goes to show that the dingbats at <br/>\nthe museum do not know what they are doing. There are sections that <br/>\nare truly NOT kid-friendly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, it has been a year and for the first time in a year I feel <br/>\nthat, yes, we are actually unschooling. Evan wants to learn how to <br/>\nwrite all these intriguing words he has learned like <br/>\n&quot;excavation&quot;,&quot;carnosaur&quot; and such. He really wants to read, so he can <br/>\nstop asking us to read the instructions on his CD-ROM and webgames. <br/>\nAnd Aidan is fascinated with the I SPY books  and money so we are <br/>\ndoing a lot of I SPY in English and Spanish and a lot of counting and <br/>\nsorting. Even at 2.5, they know what they want and how to accomplish <br/>\nit. It&#39;s so damn cute to hear him go, &quot;Mom, COME. Sit here, READ! If <br/>\nit is an I SPY book I have him *read* it. So he starts *reading*. <br/>\nThen Evan joins in and I leave because now, the two of them are <br/>\n*reading*  together. It is so AWESOME!<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I bought the &quot;Hey, I&#39;m Reading&quot; book, I had told Evan that <br/>\nbefore reading words he could learn how to read images. Well, after <br/>\nwe got the aforementioned book, it validated what I had told him and <br/>\nboy, now he just does not stop reading signs. That&#39;s why both love <br/>\nthe I SPY books (they both can read them, right?); and that&#39;s why he <br/>\ncan&#39;t wait to learn how to read more words. One thing I love about <br/>\nNYC is the NY Public Library --we have resources galore.  DK <br/>\nPublishing has the &quot;Eyewitness&quot; Nature & Science Books and Video <br/>\nseries. The library has virtually all of them and what is great is <br/>\nthat you can take out both the video and the book. So we watch the <br/>\nvideos (I&#39;m a sucker for nature documentaries) and then at night or <br/>\nduring down time we read the books. And in them we get all sorts of <br/>\nideas for projects and what not. Let&#39;s say, it&#39;s fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, I truly believe, would not have been possible if I had not had <br/>\nthat &quot;A-HA!&quot; moment about deschooling. The whole topic came up in the <br/>\nwriters list at HEM and that&#39;s how it ended as an article. I am sure, <br/>\ngiven the amount of input I had from veteran homeschoolers, that it <br/>\nwill be as helpful to others as it has been to me.
