But for some reason, the <br/>\nC word just makes me cringe. Yes I know it shoulnd&#39;t, it&#39;sjust a word but <br/>\nthat one does it for me. Just the sound of it. I&#39;m thinking, like in the <br/>\narticle, that it&#39;s because of how I always heard it used. Always to describe <br/>\nwomen in just the worst possible way. I have the same problem with the N <br/>\nword too. I know it&#39;s used a lot now in songs and even within the black <br/>\ncommunity, as term of endearment, although a lot of black people argue that <br/>\nthought too. I just remember growing up and how I heard it used and what I <br/>\nknow they meant. I guess it&#39;s still with me today on both of those words but <br/>\nI deal with it the best I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the world�s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":68345311,"authorName":"Valerie","from":"&quot;Valerie&quot; &lt;valfitz@...&gt;","profile":"valfitz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"the &quot;f&quot; word or &quot;c&quot; word","postDate":"1031929014","msgId":43926,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFsc3VibSs1ZnZxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43940,"prevInTime":43925,"nextInTime":43927,"topicId":43926,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you re offended by hearing certain words, you might not want to read the following essay that Laurie wrote for an Advanced Grammar and Composition class.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1814892284\">If you&#39;re offended by hearing certain words, you might not want to <br/>\nread the following essay that Laurie wrote for an Advanced Grammar <br/>\nand Composition class.

The <br/>\nauthor, Inga Muscio, became interested in the word after completing a <br/>\nwriting assignment at work and mislabeling &quot;Word Count&quot; as &quot;Word <br/>\nCunt&quot;.  After her supervisor pointed out her obscene misspelling, she <br/>\nliked the way it looked and started calling herself the &quot;Word Cunt&quot;.  <br/>\nExtreme reactions to this led her to do research on the offending <br/>\nword, which produced material that inspired her enough to write a <br/>\nbook.<br/>\n        Muscio says that she would rather say cunt than vagina <br/>\nbecause the latter means &quot;sheath for a sword&quot;.  She thought that her <br/>\nbody should mean more than what it was in relation to a man, so she <br/>\nchose to use cunt because the etymology of that word was much nicer.  <br/>\nIt had only been made &quot;dirty&quot; because it was a word women used and <br/>\nmen turned it against them.<br/>\n         This is fascinating, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that <br/>\nmany people shudder when they hear the &quot;c-word&quot;, which is fascinating <br/>\nin itself.  The power of one word to turn one&#39;s stomach is amazing.  <br/>\nThere are certain words that, said without any inflection or written <br/>\nalone on a piece of paper, can provoke emotional and sometimes <br/>\nphysical reactions.  These reactions lessen as we hear the word more <br/>\nand more, causing us to become desensitized.<br/>\n         I will readily admit that I am desensitized to most words.  <br/>\nI knew this for certain when someone asked me if a movie that I had <br/>\njust seen had too much cursing in it and I didn&#39;t remember.  I am not <br/>\nbothered in the least by profanity in public space, as long as the <br/>\nspeaker knows other words too.<br/>\n        My Aunt Laura used to say that people who cursed had bad <br/>\nvocabularies.  When I was young I believed this, but as I got older I <br/>\ncame upon a revelation: curse words are just words, so if you use a <br/>\ncurse word then you have mathematically increased your vocabulary.  I <br/>\ndo know that she really meant that if someone needed to use cursing <br/>\nto express him or herself and could find no other way, then their <br/>\nvocabulary was limited.  I accepted this, but did not think about it <br/>\nany further until I attended the Voodoo Fest last year.<br/>\n        The Voodoo Fest is a massive outdoor concert that is held in <br/>\nNew Orleans the weekend before Halloween.  Ten to twenty bands of <br/>\nvarying notoriety play on three different stages, artisans set up <br/>\ntents, and throngs of people walk around and get dirty, high, drunk, <br/>\nsunburned and dehydrated (I&#39;m not going back this year).  One of the <br/>\nperformers at the 2000 Fest was Eminem, a young rapper much maligned <br/>\nfor the violence and cursing in his music.  I had heard his hit songs <br/>\nand found them catchy if nothing else, so my friends and I planned to <br/>\nwatch him.<br/>\n          Eminem went through a few hits, then launched into one that <br/>\nI had never heard before, called I Shit on You.  The chorus was as <br/>\nfollows:<br/>\n\tIf you don&#39;t like my shit, then you can suck my bad-ass dick! <br/>\n&lt;repeat&gt;<br/>\n\tI shit on you! &lt;repeat several times&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n       I finally truly understood what Aunt Laura was talking about <br/>\nwhen she spoke of limited vocabularies.  I was growing annoyed  <br/>\nEminem was using these words like a little kid who has just <br/>\ndiscovered a new toy.  I have long been a student of the proper way <br/>\nto cuss someone out and Eminem hadn&#39;t.  The enlightened user of <br/>\nprofanity blends it with big, confusing words and non-profane <br/>\ninsults.  I&#39;ll mark that concert as the first time in my short adult <br/>\nlife that I got sick of &quot;dirty words&quot;.-<br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie Chancey</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43938,"nextTopicId":43867}}
