They keep a record of all that stuff.<br/>\nOver the holidays, the news kept flashing that shot of the guy arrested for attempting to blow up a Paris flight. I asked dsister how she would have reacted if she had seen him on one of her flights. (I know this gets into discrimination... I call it instinct). She said she would have viewed him with great suspicion and never hesitates to let the pilots know of suspicious looking people on her flights.  I mean, wouldn&#39;t *you* (collective &#39;you&#39;) have been a little leary of that guy? <br/>\nShe (my sister) has some &#39;war stories&#39; that are pretty scary but I won&#39;t go into them now.
