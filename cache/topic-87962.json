Jack Horner <br/>\nhas made some of the greatest discoveries in the world of Paleontology, and <br/>\nafter making a name for himself earned an honorary degree.**<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, not exactly. He has written that he just couldn&#39;t get himself to do the <br/>\nhumanities requirements for a degree - but he took every undergraduate and <br/>\ngraduate course available in biology in geology. He describes himself as <br/>\ndyslexic. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.west.net/~ger/JackHorner.html)\">http://www.west.net/~ger/JackHorner.html)</a> He was remarkably single minded <br/>\nfrom a very young age. His is a remarkable story of persistance, and of <br/>\npursuing what one loves.<br/>\n<br/>\nJack Horner &quot;First of all, you should know that I would&#39;ve done this as a <br/>\nhobby. When I went to school I of course took a lot of paleontology classes but I <br/>\nalso studied petroleum geology so that I could go out and get a job as a <br/>\npetroleum engineer and look for fossils on the side. I would have been a truck <br/>\ndriver or anything else so long as I could look for fossils whether I got paid <br/>\nfor it or not.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87819,"nextTopicId":72853}}
