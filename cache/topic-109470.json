He can tell you all about the weaponry used throughout history,<br/>\nup to exactly how many rounds per second a specific model of gun can<br/>\nshoot.<br/>\nHe can talk history and politics and religion with the best of them<br/>\nand probably correct you on history you thought you knew but was<br/>\nfalse....like George Washington not being the first president of the U.S. <br/>\nI could go on and on. Not one of those interests equals success. Not a<br/>\nsingle one of those interests means anything unless he chooses to use<br/>\nthem a certain way.  Every one of them could equal HUGE success if he<br/>\ndecided to employ them to a decided end.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuccess is not measurable...unless you decide that what a person owns<br/>\ndictates success. I prefer to think of success as a person feeling<br/>\nthey are achieving the life they choose. How many people do you know<br/>\npersonally that are doing exactly what they choose and love their<br/>\nlives? How many?<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery one of my four children is creative, thoughtful, intelligent,<br/>\nfun and learning constantly. That&#39;s more than I can say for most human<br/>\nbeings. It&#39;s pretty easy to see how unschooling makes sense if you<br/>\nagree that humans are born with the desire to learn. Unmotivated<br/>\npeople usually have some pain keeping them from fulfilling their<br/>\ndreams. Humans WANT to have a good life, they WANT to learn. The only<br/>\nthing I&#39;ve ever seen to stop learning, is coercion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love that recent article on Barb Lundgren&#39;s child. He&#39;s done some<br/>\nreally off beat things...including being homeless for a while (by<br/>\nCHOICE), but every bit of his life is about choice. He loves his life,<br/>\nhe sees it as a big learning adventure and he knows he is capable of<br/>\nacheiving whatever he chooses.<br/>\nThat&#39;s more than most people ever have. And it&#39;s enough for this<br/>\nfamily to be convinced that unschooling is the only life for us. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust the fact that my children feel empowered to do anything they<br/>\ndream, that IS enough. It&#39;s more than enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about the esoteric things in life you can&#39;t measure.<br/>\nIt&#39;s about the REAL things in life, the things that matter the most.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh, but you&#39;re not here to understand unschooling are you? That&#39;s<br/>\nok....I need to get back to my busy, happy, interesting life<br/>\nanyway..no more time to talk. There are lovely leaves blowing across<br/>\nthe yard, I think I&#39;ll go sit in the breeze for a bit and sip some tea<br/>\nwith my lovely children.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109484,"nextTopicId":109507}}
