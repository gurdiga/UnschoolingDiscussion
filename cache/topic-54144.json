I do believe I would get a second opinion,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; given that these baby teeth are about to go by the wayside<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyway.  As to how to deal with a cavity prone kid with bad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dental hygiene, dunno - except to suspect that there is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; relationship between the prior dental pressure and treatment and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; current resistance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I thought the same when she had her first cavities.  But one of them<br/>\n&gt;got so bad, it had an abscess and had to be pulled and a spacer put in.  At<br/>\n&gt;least, I felt I didn&#39;t want her to have more pain.  Her current dentist was<br/>\n&gt;more than willing to do as little as possible, but she showed me the x-rays<br/>\n&gt;and the decay is going down the root.  She wanted to avoid her having<br/>\n&gt;another abscess and another tooth pulled, hence the suggestion to have them<br/>\n&gt;looked after at the specialist.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And I think you are right about the resistance.

Called the dentist, we had been going<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; this guy for years, and he looked at her teeth, declared them very<br/>\ndecayed,<br/>\n&gt; and told us he would have to tie her down, for about 1 1/2 hrs while he<br/>\ndid<br/>\n&gt; work on the three front teeth.  Maybe he would have to go back later.  She<br/>\n&gt; would probably cry. Possibly for the whole 1 /12 hrs, but maybe she would<br/>\ngo<br/>\n&gt; to sleep. He smiled as he said this, and my stomach dropped out. We could<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; it in the hospital under general, but we had to do it, and we didn&#39;t want<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; put her under general did we?  What could we do for her? Couldn&#39;t we do it<br/>\n&gt; one tooth at a time, to see how she was feeling? Since one tooth would<br/>\ntake<br/>\n&gt; about 15mins or so, and then work on the next tooth? No.  Best to do all<br/>\n&gt; three at once.  Wasn&#39;t there something else?  He suggested a cocktail for<br/>\nme<br/>\n&gt;   I wanted to knock his stupid teeth out his smile made me so sick. He<br/>\n&gt; implied if we didn&#39;t have the work done great catastrophes were in store<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; us. We made an appointment for a month later, and I got to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAhhh, Rachel Ann.  I know what you mean.  I had the same experience with her<br/>\nfirst dentist (mine also).  I felt manipulated.  He even said, &quot; if she were<br/>\nmy daughter, I would do it.&quot;  This is when we were facing the pulled tooth.<br/>\nWhen I wanted to think about it, he basically ignored me the rest of the<br/>\ntime we were there.  I wondered afterward about his big house, pool, horses<br/>\nand expensive cars and thought how we were buying them with my daughter&#39;s<br/>\ntrust.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I called around and got another or rather several opinions. Finally took<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; daughter to the dentist I use who was billed as a family dentistry<br/>\npractice.<br/>\n&gt;  One dentist came out to the waiting room to look at her teeth as they<br/>\ndidn<br/>\n&gt; t take children that young into the room itself.  Everyone there, the<br/>\n&gt; dentist, nurses etc. kept saying, we just let the teeth rot and fall out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okay...she at that point wasn&#39;t in any pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second dentist was a hip young thing, who was into high tech stuff and<br/>\nhad a really nice assistant.  They were both women and this seemed to make a<br/>\ndifference to my daughter.  But they made some serious mistakes in my mind.<br/>\nThreatening her with turning off the tv, taking away her treat if she didn&#39;t<br/>\nsubmit, telling her it couldn&#39;t be that bad, stop crying.  This after<br/>\nfitting her spacer, then being unable to get it off to put the &quot;glue&quot; on it<br/>\n(yeah, my daughter&#39;s going to want glue in her mouth) and coming at her with<br/>\npliers.  And then she couldn&#39;t get it off anyway.  It was awful.  We were<br/>\nboth absolute wrecks afterward.  And it&#39;s still there after 1 1/2 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Later she was in pain and another tooth looked bad;  I took her back to<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; dentist.  Another dentist, the one I had usually seen and who owned the<br/>\n&gt; practice, said she needed to be looked at by a pediatric dentist, and gave<br/>\n&gt; me some names.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; More calling till I found a dentist who was willing to work on her without<br/>\n&gt; her screaming for 1 1/2.<br/>\n&gt; She was gentle, talked to my child, funny, friendly, courteous, and was<br/>\n&gt; willing to work with us to make Tehila happy,  or as happy as she could<br/>\nbe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We ended up having her sedated and gave a bit of gas, and had the four<br/>\nfront<br/>\n&gt; teeth pulled. She fussed a minute or so while getting the gas, but<br/>\n&gt; afterwards was fine.  She has done fine in eating and nursing; hasn&#39;t<br/>\nmissed<br/>\n&gt; the dentist at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The dentist has made it a good experience for her; friendly, loving,<br/>\nsmiling<br/>\n&gt; etc. etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, this is what it has been like with the new dentist, finally.  And she<br/>\nis the kind of person who advocates a wait-and-see approach.  Dd&#39;s front<br/>\nbottom adult teeth came in in back of her baby teeth.  The first dentist<br/>\n(whom I saw and decided to ask his opinion when I was in the office for<br/>\nhygiene) would have pulled them, sight unseen.  The new dentist is letting<br/>\nthem fall out when they are ready (one is still there - dd looks like a<br/>\nshark &lt;g&gt;.)   So, I&#39;m feeling more trusting of her advice.  And she really<br/>\nwants Michelle to be comfortable, hence the suggestion of general<br/>\nanaesthetic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Really, I think the trick is to never put your child in that dental chair<br/>\n&gt; unless and until you have a doctor who isn&#39;t a sadist, who in fact<br/>\nactually<br/>\n&gt; likes children and is willing to work with you and your child for that<br/>\nchild<br/>\n&gt; s comfort.<br/>\n<br/>\nExactly.  I didn&#39;t trust my instincts until too late for the most part.  I<br/>\nthink I&#39;ve found the right dentist for her.  And in spite of the difficulty<br/>\nMichelle&#39;s had with her visits (frightened and uncooperative), *she* still<br/>\nwants to go back to her because she&#39;s gentle and courteous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think it&#39;s up to me to be her advocate in advance now.  I&#39;ve been too<br/>\nwilling to take what they say as the &quot;truth&quot; until it all goes bad.  Time to<br/>\nbe skeptical and proactive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The first doctor btw was a sadist.  Several other people I met and talked<br/>\n&gt; with later complained about his disrespectful ways with children,<br/>\ninsisting<br/>\n&gt; they weren&#39;t in pain when they were, getting angry at a child because she<br/>\n&gt; kicked him (not deliberately) when she reacted in pain etc. etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder how people like this stay in business.  I think there aren&#39;t enough<br/>\nparents who are willing to question because of their own experiences, like<br/>\nme.  It&#39;s tied up with approval-seeking for me - I&#39;m finally beginning to<br/>\nextricate myself from that.

I have seen 4 dentists in the last<br/>\n&gt; month for that reason alone. I want to be comfortable with the decision I<br/>\n&gt; make based on what I&#39;ve heard. I&#39;m not sure about filling baby teeth. It<br/>\n&gt; does sound a bit strange though considering her age right now. So far all<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; kids are cavity free from age 2 to 17.<br/>\n<br/>\nLucky them!  Probably good genes and hygiene.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had to deal with this, I would<br/>\n&gt; get 3 opinions if need be until I felt sure. You don&#39;t sound all that<br/>\n&gt; comfortable with what they are suggesting to do. If they still suggest<br/>\n&gt; filling, I would go for the anesthesia.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n I had to have 6 teeth pulled at once<br/>\n&gt; when I was about 10. They put me out and it was so stress free. I wish<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; would put me out for the work I need to come. Can&#39;t talk them into it<br/>\n&gt; though!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I&#39;ve asked for the same thing and keep getting turned down.  And now<br/>\nNovocaine isn&#39;t working as well for me.  I need at least 4 needles per tooth<br/>\nto get the nerves to freeze.  I know sometimes you get what you need to deal<br/>\nwith, but this is too much!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as dental treatment in the future if your daughters is prone to<br/>\n&gt; problems......I would do whatever it took. Dealing with what I have to do<br/>\n&gt; now, I&#39;m very aggressive in letting my kids know how important it is for<br/>\n&gt; them to take care of their teeth so they don&#39;t have to deal with what I do<br/>\n&gt; now. I went out and bought everyone recommended toothbrushes and watch now<br/>\n&gt; how they brush. I even watched my husband tonight and gave him tips!!!! I<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t do that every night now but I will keep up with it. I&#39;ll read to<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; about tooth problems and gum disease. I&#39;ll show pictures if I have to.<br/>\nIt&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; just not worth it. I also made my daughters boyfriend tonight promise to<br/>\nsee<br/>\n&gt; a dentist as he has a toothache.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try not to scare her as she has enough fears as it is.  But stepping up<br/>\nthe hygiene and assistance from me will be a good start.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okay so another thing to be anal about. At least it&#39;s a bit more important<br/>\n&gt; than my clean floors!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree!<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":110297210,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"&quot;Robin Bentley&quot; &lt;robinbentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] More dentists...","postDate":"1042231851","msgId":54222,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2YwMWMyYjhlOSRmNjQxZTZjMCRiYTAwYThjMEBiYy5oc2lhLnRlbHVzLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDE2Ny4xOWQ0OWE5Yy4yYjUwMWY0MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54221,"nextInTopic":54223,"prevInTime":54221,"nextInTime":54223,"topicId":54144,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Called the dentist, we had been going to<br/>\nthis guy for years, and he looked at her teeth, declared them very decayed,<br/>\nand told us he would have to tie her down, for about 1 1/2 hrs while he did<br/>\nwork on the three front teeth.  Maybe he would have to go back later.  She<br/>\nwould probably cry. Possibly for the whole 1 /12 hrs, but maybe she would go<br/>\nto sleep. He smiled as he said this, and my stomach dropped out. We could do<br/>\nit in the hospital under general, but we had to do it, and we didn&#39;t want to<br/>\nput her under general did we?  What could we do for her? Couldn&#39;t we do it<br/>\none tooth at a time, to see how she was feeling? Since one tooth would take<br/>\nabout 15mins or so, and then work on the next tooth? No.  Best to do all<br/>\nthree at once.  Wasn&#39;t there something else?  He suggested a cocktail for me<br/>\n  I wanted to knock his stupid teeth out his smile made me so sick. He<br/>\nimplied if we didn&#39;t have the work done great catastrophes were in store for<br/>\nus. We made an appointment for a month later, and I got to work.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI called around and got another or rather several opinions. Finally took my<br/>\ndaughter to the dentist I use who was billed as a family dentistry practice.<br/>\n One dentist came out to the waiting room to look at her teeth as they didn<br/>\nt take children that young into the room itself.  Everyone there, the<br/>\ndentist, nurses etc. kept saying, we just let the teeth rot and fall out.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOkay...she at that point wasn&#39;t in any pain.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLater she was in pain and another tooth looked bad;  I took her back to the<br/>\ndentist.  Another dentist, the one I had usually seen and who owned the<br/>\npractice, said she needed to be looked at by a pediatric dentist, and gave<br/>\nme some names.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMore calling till I found a dentist who was willing to work on her without<br/>\nher screaming for 1 1/2.  \r<br/>\nShe was gentle, talked to my child, funny, friendly, courteous, and was<br/>\nwilling to work with us to make Tehila happy,  or as happy as she could be.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe ended up having her sedated and gave a bit of gas, and had the four front<br/>\nteeth pulled. She fussed a minute or so while getting the gas, but<br/>\nafterwards was fine.  She has done fine in eating and nursing; hasn&#39;t missed<br/>\nthe dentist at all.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe dentist has made it a good experience for her; friendly, loving, smiling<br/>\netc. etc.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nReally, I think the trick is to never put your child in that dental chair<br/>\nunless and until you have a doctor who isn&#39;t a sadist, who in fact actually<br/>\nlikes children and is willing to work with you and your child for that child<br/>\ns comfort.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe first doctor btw was a sadist.  Several other people I met and talked<br/>\nwith later complained about his disrespectful ways with children, insisting<br/>\nthey weren&#39;t in pain when they were, getting angry at a child because she<br/>\nkicked him (not deliberately) when she reacted in pain etc. etc.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n-------Original Message-------\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nDate: Friday, January 10, 2003 08:25:26\r<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] More dentists...\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nIn a message dated 1/9/03 11:48:45 PM Eastern Standard Time, \r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robinbentley@...\">robinbentley@...</a> writes:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But one of them\r<br/>\n&gt; got so bad, it had an abscess and had to be pulled and a spacer put in\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Same thing happened to Landon when he was 7..

I do believe I would get a second opinion,<br/>\ngiven that these baby teeth are about to go by the wayside<br/>\nanyway.  As to how to deal with a cavity prone kid with bad<br/>\ndental hygiene, dunno - except to suspect that there is a<br/>\nrelationship between the prior dental pressure and treatment and<br/>\ncurrent resistance.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree on the second opinion thing. I have seen 4 dentists in the last <br/>\nmonth for that reason alone. I want to be comfortable with the decision I <br/>\nmake based on what I&#39;ve heard. I&#39;m not sure about filling baby teeth. It <br/>\ndoes sound a bit strange though considering her age right now. So far all my <br/>\nkids are cavity free from age 2 to 17. If I had to deal with this, I would <br/>\nget 3 opinions if need be until I felt sure. You don&#39;t sound all that <br/>\ncomfortable with what they are suggesting to do. If they still suggest <br/>\nfilling, I would go for the anesthesia. I had to have 6 teeth pulled at once <br/>\nwhen I was about 10. They put me out and it was so stress free. I wish they <br/>\nwould put me out for the work I need to come. Can&#39;t talk them into it <br/>\nthough!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as dental treatment in the future if your daughters is prone to <br/>\nproblems......I would do whatever it took. Dealing with what I have to do <br/>\nnow, I&#39;m very aggressive in letting my kids know how important it is for <br/>\nthem to take care of their teeth so they don&#39;t have to deal with what I do <br/>\nnow. I went out and bought everyone recommended toothbrushes and watch now <br/>\nhow they brush. I even watched my husband tonight and gave him tips!!!! I <br/>\nwon&#39;t do that every night now but I will keep up with it. I&#39;ll read to them <br/>\nabout tooth problems and gum disease. I&#39;ll show pictures if I have to. It&#39;s <br/>\njust not worth it. I also made my daughters boyfriend tonight promise to see <br/>\na dentist as he has a toothache.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay so another thing to be anal about.

If you can keep them really clean they may be<br/>\n&gt; able to last until they fall out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, this is the trick.  With her reluctance to have anyone touch her<br/>\nteeth, including herself &lt;sigh&gt;, it&#39;s an uphill battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son had a crack in his front tooth from<br/>\n&gt; a fall and we held onto that tooth for three years before it really<br/>\nstarted<br/>\n&gt; to show in the front and become a problem.  We have the best pediatric<br/>\n&gt; dentist though.  She just kept an eye on it and we kept it really clean.<br/>\nBut<br/>\n&gt; when it started to become a problem we did have to have it taken care of<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; used nitrous oxide which helped a lot.  He was scared going in and we<br/>\ntalked<br/>\n&gt; about everything ahead of time and I told him it was OK to be scared, I<br/>\nwould &gt; be there with him holding his hand.  But he soon relaxed with the<br/>\nnitrous<br/>\n&gt; oxide. And everything went smoothly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is heartening.<br/>\n<br/>\n Our dentist explained to me that the<br/>\n&gt; baby teeth have no nerves like secondary teeth.  So you don&#39;t need<br/>\nNovocain.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, her first 3 fillings were done without needles, but still with a metal<br/>\nclamp that went over her teeth, which was painful.  I had no idea that was<br/>\ngoing to happen.  And this one and the dentist who pulled her abscessed<br/>\ntooth both insisted she have Atavan, so that she would forget the<br/>\nexperience. Ha.  For the extraction, she had Novocaine and pliers and<br/>\nblood.....she remembers *everything* from both visits.  And she was<br/>\nadversely affected by the Atavan the second time.  Her current dentist<br/>\nthinks Atavan is a bad idea (thank goodness.)<br/>\n<br/>\nArgh.  My remembrances of dentists (mine and hers) has my palms<br/>\na-sweating.  And yet, I subjected her to all the things I hated, thinking I<br/>\nwas doing the right thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Anyway your child may have a more serious problem than we have dealt with<br/>\nso  your situation may be different.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would seem.

Her <br/>\n&gt;current dentist (empathetic, goes slow, will not force anything if the <br/>\n&gt;child does not want it) suggested we go to a pediatric specialist to have <br/>\n&gt;the work done under anaesthetic, so as not to traumatize her with more <br/>\n&gt;needles etc.  She wants to then build up her trust bit by bit, so she can <br/>\n&gt;just clean her teeth (Michelle is sensitive to noise, is frightened of <br/>\n&gt;anything that sounds like a drill and is loathe to have anyone touch her <br/>\n&gt;mouth most of the time, including me.)  I have always been reluctant to <br/>\n&gt;force her tooth brushing and flossing (she won&#39;t do the flossing and only <br/>\n&gt;occasionally will let me do it for her), but the consequences are beginning <br/>\n&gt;to show.

If you can keep them really clean they may be <br/>\nable to last until they fall out.  My son had a crack in his front tooth from <br/>\na fall and we held onto that tooth for three years before it really started <br/>\nto show in the front and become a problem.  We have the best pediatric <br/>\ndentist though.  She just kept an eye on it and we kept it really clean.  But <br/>\nwhen it started to become a problem we did have to have it taken care of they <br/>\nused nitrous oxide which helped a lot.  He was scared going in and we talked <br/>\nabout everything ahead of time and I told him it was OK to be scared, I would <br/>\nbe there with him holding his hand.  But he soon relaxed with the nitrous <br/>\noxide. And everything went smoothly.  Our dentist explained to me that the <br/>\nbaby teeth have no nerves like secondary teeth.  So you don&#39;t need Novocain.  <br/>\nAnyway your child may have a more serious problem than we have dealt with so <br/>\nyour situation may be different.<br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10722572,"authorName":"Nora or Devereaux Cannon","from":"&quot;Nora or Devereaux Cannon&quot; &lt;dcannon@...&gt;","profile":"thatincase","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] More dentists...","postDate":"1042161693","msgId":54150,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA4MTMwMWMyYjg0YiQ4NWJiNTU2MCQ2NDIyZmVhOUBkYnE1MjBiPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMmQwMWMyYjg0MiQ2NmE0NmY4MCRiYTAwYThjMEBiYy5oc2lhLnRlbHVzLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":54146,"nextInTopic":54152,"prevInTime":54149,"nextInTime":54151,"topicId":54144,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have been told by 3 different dentists that there is almost no reason to fill a baby tooth - though pediatric dentists make a killing doing it.
