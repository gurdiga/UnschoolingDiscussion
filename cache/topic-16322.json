We&#39;re busy with \nour families and don&#39;t&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; always use the opportunities that arise \nto ensure the&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; future of teaching our children. Don&#39;t be \ndeceived!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Groups that are AGAINST home education are \nfrequently&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; lobbying local, state, and federal officials for \nmore&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; control over our children. We need to \ncontinually&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; work to keep the laws we currently have as well as \nto&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; improve them.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Right now we have an \nopportunity to be proactive.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; President George W. Bush is \ncommitted to education&nbsp;</font></font></font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Comic Sans MS\">&nbsp; \nreform and open to ideas that work. Home education&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; has proven \nitself over and over to be effective. Now&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; is the time to plant \nseeds for future legislation from&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Washington, D.C. that will \nsafeguard home schooling.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Join us in a simple project to \nmake the home schooling&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; community visible to President Bush and \nSecretary Rod&nbsp;</font></font></font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Comic Sans MS\">&nbsp; \nPaige (Dept. of Education) in an encouraging,&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; non-threatening \nmanner. Participate in our &quot;Postcards&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; for Choice in Education.&quot; \nHere is the plan:&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Postcards \nfor Choice in \nEducation&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Between \nnow and the end of February each home&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; schooling family OR each \nfamily that supports home&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; schooling (grandparents, aunts and \nuncles, friends,&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; neighbors) sends postcards to Washington,D.C. \nSend one&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; to President George W. Bush and one to the \nSecretary&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; of Education. (Addresses are below.) Write a \nsimple&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; note to each gentleman asking for his support \nin&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; defending home education. If your family is \npraying&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; for him, tell him so.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; \n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The \n </span></blockquote>Postcards&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; \nAny tactful postcard would be fine.

Some suggestions follow--&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; A. Home Education \nWorks-2001&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; B. Support a parent&#39;s right to educate \ntheir&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; children.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; C.

The key \nhere is to have as many families&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; represented as possible, \nand multiple cards from a&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; family are acceptable. If your \nchildren write, please&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; help them to write clearly and \nneatly.

Again, if your children pray for \nour&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; officials, mention that on the \ncard.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &gt;&gt;Thank \nYou&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; \nThank you for participating in Postcards for Choice in&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; \nEducation.
