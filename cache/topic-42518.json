I recall a story in the papers several years ago about <br/>\na child who was shot by a policeman because he was pointing a black <br/>\ngun at him (the child at the cop).  It turned out to be a toy, but <br/>\nlooked realistic enough at a distance to make the cop think it was <br/>\nreal.  After that is when the toy companies were pressured (there may <br/>\nhave been laws passed about it as well, if I remember correctly) to <br/>\nmake their toy guns look anything but realistic.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":21583096,"authorName":"rayvenne@aol.com","from":"rayvenne@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: toy guns","postDate":"1030709113","msgId":42537,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhjLjFkNjZmNGQxLjJhYTBiOTc5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":42535,"nextInTopic":92638,"prevInTime":42536,"nextInTime":42538,"topicId":42518,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/30/2002 2:21:47 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...

And I&#39;ve never seen a toy gun that looked real.  Not <br/>\nto say there aren&#39;t any, but they must be hard to come by because I&#39;ve never <br/>\nseen one at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is children aren&#39;t stupid and CAN tell toys from real things, <br/>\nwhether it&#39;s food or dolls or guns.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think I would wish to count on a young child registering the<br/>\ndifference in weight between a toy and the real thing or that he/she would<br/>\nassume that just because it was heavy that it shouldn&#39;t be played with.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of Sleeping Beauty is you can try to destroy every spindle in the <br/>\nkingdom, but it&#39;s not goin to work.
