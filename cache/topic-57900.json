Now, it&#39;s cool!  We discuss law, justice, and<br/>\nfairness; last evening we discussed &#39;blurring&#39; the law as a way of getting<br/>\n&#39;justice&#39;. She also is aware that Law & Order calls upon a host of New York<br/>\nactors. She can spot the gray areas in search & seizure. We talk about each<br/>\ncase as it starts unfolding. Last night, as soon as she saw the victim, she<br/>\nsaid &quot;blow to the head&quot; and then she said, &quot;She was a victim on this show<br/>\nbefore&quot;.  She has started to read a bit about animals & the law. And she&#39;s<br/>\nputting together a list of places that have strong animal protection laws.<br/>\nNow, we&#39;re going to walk the dog.<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<br/>\nCoyotes Corner<br/>\nVery Cool Stuff for the World<br/>\n&lt;www.coyotescorner.com&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: megamom08 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:megamom08@...\">megamom08@...</a>&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:megamom08@...\">megamom08@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 05, 2003 8:24 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] one year later<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t participated in this group in some time, it&#39;s hard to keep<br/>\nup, it&#39;s so busy! I am happy to report we are still unschooling,<br/>\nafter pulling my daughter from fourth grade last February. It has<br/>\ntaken faith and patience.

Right now it&#39;s anatomy (a big human body project<br/>\nshe is working on) and geometry. She still never finishes a book that<br/>\nshe starts, but neither do I!

She has also made big changes in<br/>\nkeeping herself and her bedroom organized and some other behavioral<br/>\nissues that she had. I really believe that a job well done is reward<br/>\nin itself, and bribing and nagging is just ineffective. She is not<br/>\nthe same child she was when I pulled her from school.
