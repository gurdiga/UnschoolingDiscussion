The pup ran right up to it and stuffed her nose down <br/>\non it to see what it was. And of course it bit her, in the neck. We rushed <br/>\nher to a vet and she survived. As the years went by the rattlers decided we <br/>\nwere no fun to live with I guess because we no longer find them in the yard. <br/>\nBut a small child was bit by a rattler 20 miles from here and he lived in <br/>\ntown.
