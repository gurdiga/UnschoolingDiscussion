This is taken<br/>\nfrom the group&#39;s description:<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\nFound a great board game? Know when a cool show will be on? How about<br/>\nthat awesome book your son just finished reading? Here&#39;s a place to<br/>\nshare what you&#39;ve found and to discover even more ways to feed your<br/>\nchildren&#39;s passions! Games (of all sorts), books, science equipment,<br/>\nwebsites, television shows, art supplies, toys, movies, math<br/>\nmanipulatives, magazines, etc.... LOTS of etc!<br/>\n <br/>\nHas your family developed a cool game using spoons, strawberry baskets<br/>\nand beanbags? Tell us about it! Found a great touring exhibit? Fallen<br/>\nin love with a comic book? Found the perfect crayon? Discovered a new<br/>\nscience fiction series your daughter just can&#39;t get enough of? This is<br/>\nthe place to post about it! <br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, if your child suddenly develops a passion for dinosaurs,<br/>\nastronomy, 1950s musicals, calculus, interior decorating, King Tut,<br/>\nKiwi birds, dragons, or the Union army, this is the place to ask for<br/>\nresource suggestions!<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat this group is NOT about: worksheets/workbooks, links to<br/>\nattendance sheets, gradebooks or planners, curriculum of any sort,<br/>\ndiscussions of home/unschooling theory, discussions of<br/>\nhome/unschooling in general, advertising businesses, etc. There are<br/>\nmany other lists devoted to these things. <br/>\n <br/>\n****<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, I&#39;ve set up several pages at the Live Free Learn Free website<br/>\n(www.livefreelearnfree.com) that will be devoted to listing many of<br/>\nthe resources suggested on the UR list.  Just click on &quot;Resources.&quot;<br/>\nThese pages are still being set up, but a few have a good bit of<br/>\ninformation, already.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n <br/>\nHappy unschooling!<br/>\nShana Ronayne Hickman (editor)<br/>\nwww.livefreelearnfree.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107500,"nextTopicId":107522}}
