I completely agree!  We see so many folks doing things that are<br/>\nnegligent, careless and downright dangerous with their children.  We just<br/>\nshake our heads and sigh.  Our favorite refrain is &quot;I guess they must have<br/>\nspares&quot; because the families around here tend to be large and closely<br/>\nspaced.  Some people should not only not be trusted with other people&#39;s<br/>\nchildren, but are not fit to be trusted with their own.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA family near here recently lost two sons (10 and 13) to a terrible<br/>\ntragedy.  The boys had built a Cave/Tunnel/Hide Out in a gravel pile at a<br/>\nnearby landfill and it caved in on them.  The parents say they had told the<br/>\nboys &quot;again and again&quot; to stay away from there, but I had to wonder where<br/>\nthey thought these kids were spending all of their time.  Didn&#39;t they<br/>\nwonder when they were gone for hours and hours during the afternoons<br/>\nbuilding this thing?  Didn&#39;t they keep tabs on where their kids were?  That<br/>\ntunnel was not dug overnight, or even in a week.  They had it shored up and<br/>\nwere spending time there with another boy who escaped the collapse.  I<br/>\nreally feel for their loss, as I have two sons myself, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand what they were doing with their time that was so important that<br/>\ntheir lack of attention cost them two of their children.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll<br/>\nbe more careful with their remaining children (I hope.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Joseph A. & Susan D.

Most of them think we are NUTS for choosing to raise<br/>\nour children ourselves.  (Of course, they also say we are nuts for<br/>\nhomeschooling, having eight pets and living in a house they think is too<br/>\nsmall!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I do NOT understand why people have kids and then leave them in<br/>\ndaycare for 10+ hours a day.  This makes no sense....get them up early, drop<br/>\nthem at daycare, pick them up after work, stuff some dinner into them and<br/>\nput them in bed.  I do NOT understand why people have kids when they do not<br/>\nintend to ever be with them!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe if you choose to have children you should realize this is a HUGE<br/>\ncommittment....both in time and energy.  I would NEVER have had kids if I<br/>\nKNEW I was going to place them into someone else&#39;s hands five days a week,<br/>\n10-12 hours a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do realize that some families have children, intending for one parent to<br/>\nbe home with them....then something happens and the parents must work.  I am<br/>\nnot speaking of these families.  I have so many relatives that work to<br/>\nsupply the THINGS they WANT in their lives.  When all is said and done, it<br/>\ndoes not matter how big your house is, how many fancy cars you have.  I<br/>\nbelieve what matters is how you have raised your children.  If you child is<br/>\nwith someone for the majority of their waking hours, he/she will learn the<br/>\nvalues of the person they are with , NOT their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is pretty sad when a baby knows a caretaker better than her/his<br/>\nown parents.  I have seen this over and over.....I watched a little girl for<br/>\n50+ hours a week.  One weekend, I was at THEIR home for a party...the little<br/>\ngirl fell....she would NOT go to her parents for comfort...she came to ME.<br/>\nIsn&#39;t there something wrong with that picture?  I suppose I should have been<br/>\nflattered that this little one trusted me so much...but shouldn&#39;t it be her<br/>\nMOTHER or FATHER that she seeks out for comfort?  Incidentally...the mom<br/>\nquit her job three weeks later to be with her daughter!<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, not everyone is cut out to be a full time mom or dad.  But I don&#39;t think<br/>\neveryone is cut out to be a parent either.  I am blessed to have been able<br/>\nto be home with my children for the last ten and a half years.  I am given<br/>\nthe full support of my husband....this is where I belong.  Never, ever,<br/>\nwould I give my &#39;job&#39; to someone else!!
