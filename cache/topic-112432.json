It was on around 1974-77 (not sure if it <br/>\nwas on longer), I happened to see it in my English class once a week-it may <br/>\nhave been recorded (could they do that in the mid &#39;70s?), may have been live... <br/>\nI believe it was a PBS show. It dealt with Latin prefixes and suffixes (I <br/>\nthink-it was definitely word parts and their history and meanings), my memory is <br/>\nbringing up &quot;Word Smith&quot; as the name, but I&#39;m not sure. The guy that &quot;hosted&quot; <br/>\nthe show had the word parts on  3-4&quot; white balls which he dropped into this <br/>\nvery 70&#39;s looking ball-on-a-pedestal (or maybe he started with them there-I just <br/>\nremember the funny slide-whistle sound when he dropped the word-ball for <br/>\nviewing or when it was finished) sculpture thing.... That&#39;s about as much detail <br/>\nas I can remember. I could probably search for it if I had the name, but I&#39;ve <br/>\nlooked briefly under &quot;word smith&quot; and found zilch. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else remember that show? I know that no one I&#39;ve talked to around here <br/>\nhas any CLUE what I&#39;m talking about :~)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSang<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112431,"nextTopicId":112398}}
