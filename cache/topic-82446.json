As I&#39;ve said MANY TIMES in my posts, the <br/>\ndecision to ask for help from the parent whose child owns that list (and, <br/>\nyes, I am 100% sure of which parent that is now, and they do come from this <br/>\nlist), was not mine, but hers.  She was/is the one that came to me w/concerns that <br/>\nthis may not have been an appropriate post; she asked me to track down where I <br/>\nfound out about the list, and ask that parent to at least take a look into <br/>\nthe matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, like I said, this isn&#39;t the reason I am not feeling comfortable here; <br/>\nhey--I&#39;m always up for a good debate :-).  But, there are several parenting <br/>\nissues that I just can&#39;t agree w/here, that most of you seem very into that I <br/>\nhonestly cannot relate to.  It&#39;s not that I feel that I am right & you are wrong; <br/>\neveryone can make their own decisions about how the want to raise their <br/>\nfamilies.  We just differ.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;ll be moving on to a much more comfortable setting for me.  I was <br/>\nhoping to get some good Unschooling ideas from here, but, for the most part, as I <br/>\nsaid, I just can&#39;t relate to most of your experiences.  LOL, my one and only <br/>\ndaughter is 17, so we are well over the issues that a lot of you seem to be <br/>\ndealing w/at the moment (i.e., the issues dealing w/younger kids).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do want to thank you for the ideas I was able to glean from some of the <br/>\ndiscussions.
