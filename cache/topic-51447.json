Yes, as you said  parents voices but also what the child says <br/>\nmeans something different to us. &#39;you didn&#39;t feed me enough&quot; you haven&#39;t <br/>\nbought the right groceries&quot; we respnd to the expectation - get up and make <br/>\nmore - different - we&#39;re short on cash and they don&#39;t know that. We take it <br/>\npersonally. Stepping aside from our own &quot;stuff&quot; and just hearing a clean <br/>\nsimple request. and we don&#39;t have to do it all. &quot;I am tired you may make <br/>\nyourself something else to eat&quot; &quot;Yes but this or that is what you may have&quot; . <br/>\n I don&#39;t know maybe I&#39;ve gone on about nothing but hearing people (including <br/>\nour children)  without taking things personally and being able to respond <br/>\nhonestly from our reality without worrying about expectations is a pretty big <br/>\nundertaking in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nRenee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2709","postDate":"1039794663","msgId":51447,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0My41MTEzYzUxLjJiMmI1YmU3QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":51481,"prevInTime":51446,"nextInTime":51448,"topicId":51447,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/13/02 7:32:36 AM Central Standard Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes:  Oh no!!","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1971008427\">In a message dated 12/13/02 7:32:36 AM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Rain broke two bones in her arm today, &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh no!!
