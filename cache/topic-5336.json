Some of the<br/>\nchildren appeared very advanced in English - according to the work <br/>\nthey were doing - reading essays - or excerpts from movie scripts<br/>\nor poems - answering questions of grammar and so on. <br/>\n<br/>\nConversation?  They were totally lost.  No outline. No questions.<br/>\nNothing to refer to...What&#39;s up?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I helped them with their work - proofread stuff - followed the<br/>\nstinking program.  We also did spoke of some stories we all knew.<br/>\nWe began conversations and stories without any testing or &quot;ulterior<br/>\nmotives&quot;.  It was fun. They opened up and had a fun time - laughing<br/>\nat the funny &#39;misunderstandings&#39; and silly &#39;errors&#39; that popped up. <br/>\nSome were hilarious. There was nothing waiting at the end of the <br/>\nline - no grade.  The learning came from learning it freely and <br/>\ngoing with it wherever it went.  This is the &quot;air&quot; that is necessary <br/>\nfor *retaining* knowledge - knowledge that someone chooses to seek out<br/>\non their own accord because they want to know and are enjoying the<br/>\nprocess of coming to know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder often about these &quot;teaching methods&quot; of foreign language. <br/>\nSo much stress on grammar and usage and written word - and translation -<br/>\nwith little attention to using and listening to the language.
