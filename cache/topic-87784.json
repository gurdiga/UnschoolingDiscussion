How cool!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Speaking of quotes, I love to gather old frames from flea markets and yard <br/>\nsales and write quotes in them and hang them around the house. Sometimes I <br/>\neven write one or two sentences from a book that inspires me . And I purposely <br/>\nchoose ones that will &quot;inspire&quot; the rest of the family or get them to think <br/>\nabout things. Very tricky...hahahaha.<br/>\n  <br/>\n   I like to hang them in places where they will see them most often...while <br/>\non the phone, computer, doing laundry, dishes, etc. I even hang one in the <br/>\nbathroom.
