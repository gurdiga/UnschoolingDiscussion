It counted as an English <br/>\nCredit, I don&#39;t know why.  But a few of us that were labeled gifted could <br/>\nchoose what we wanted to do for the year for that one period.  Although much of <br/>\nthe work was done after school etc.  We could choose from anything and then <br/>\nsubmit a form with an explanation of the topic and direction we were taking it.  <br/>\nThey would search out a mentor for us that was not a faculty member.  That <br/>\nmentor would grade us however they chose.  It was so much fun.  I chose to <br/>\ntranscribe a favorite choral number to be performed by a band that I chose.  And <br/>\nworked with a choral director from the community that I so respected.  It was, by <br/>\nfar, the best class I had in high school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was so nice to be able to submerge yourself into something that you loved, <br/>\neven though it was only one class.<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89418,"nextTopicId":89675}}
