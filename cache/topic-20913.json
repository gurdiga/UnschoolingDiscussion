We bought a<br/>\nnew mattress a few years ago and I&#39;m allergic to what&#39;s in it.  I can&#39;t use<br/>\nfoam pillows and can only use feather (the allergists either shake or<br/>\nscratch their heads).<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t had any problems with the really old-fashioned canning jars with<br/>\nthe old gasket type rubber seal thingys.  We&#39;ve also done the ceramic thing<br/>\nwhere the kidlets made a bunch of elfs and stuff for the garden.  When they<br/>\ndid that I made ceramic canisters.  Those are great because I know exactly<br/>\nwhat they are made of and what is in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are real lucky in that we live in a house that was built in 1903 and<br/>\neverything is real wood, no particle board, no formaldehyde kinda crud<br/>\nexcept some really old floor and counter stuff which we are gradually<br/>\nremoving.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best I can say about what all this has meant to us came from some<br/>\ndoctors.  Hubby had cancer (colo-rectal).  That is when I finally stop the<br/>\nslow conversion and put my foot down!  Hard!  &lt;g&gt;  At first they said it was<br/>\ngoing to require a colostomy.  I changed his diet completely, did my<br/>\nhomework on chemo and radiation and found a radiation oncologist that would<br/>\nwork with us. (The regular oncologist was a b*tt!) His tumor was reduced<br/>\nfrom over 20 cm to about 1.5 inches.  He lost no hair, he lost no weight, he<br/>\nhad no adverse reactions.  AND, he did not have to have a colostomy!!!!  The<br/>\ndocs took reams of notes and admitted that the diet had a lot to do with the<br/>\nresults!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the kidlets are healthier looking and have more energy (o.k., so there<br/>\nare some negatives &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we are gradually going to all natural, unbleached cotton for bedding,<br/>\netc.  I noticed that since we started buying local honey and using cotton<br/>\nbedding that all their little rash type allergy type things have gone away.<br/>\nNo more itching, no more red eyes, no more sneezing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Eileen M.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ravensegg@...\">ravensegg@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 09, 2001 11:37 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1219<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Do you get tins at a specific outlet?

You could make it real money, or you could make it a <br/>\nprivilege that he really wants, or whatever.  Get a jar to put his <br/>\nmoney or tokens in.  Tell him if you ring the bell and he doesn&#39;t <br/>\ncome, you will be calling the police to come and look for him, <br/>\nbecause you will assume he has been kidnapped.  Also, if he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t come, YOU get to keep the token, and put it in YOUR jar, <br/>\nand then you get to go and do something without him (something <br/>\nhe&#39;d really like to do).  After a few times of doing this, actually <br/>\nmake a big deal one day of how you are leaving him with Dad and <br/>\nlittle sister so you can go do a fun thing by yourself, and that he <br/>\nabsolutely CANNOT go.  Then, take a little holiday yourself and go <br/>\nenjoy  it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he does come in, have something that he really likes but <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get very often, available.  It might be a special food, it might <br/>\nbe an art project that is too messy or involved to get out while little <br/>\nsister is up.  When there is something that I want to get my kids <br/>\ninterested in doing, it never works to say &quot;Come on over and do <br/>\nthis with me&quot; but if I just start doing to by myself and they see me <br/>\nenjoying myself, they will often come over and want to do it too.  <br/>\nLike, I&#39;d probably get a HUGE piece of butcher paper that would <br/>\ncover a whole wall (even if I had to take the pictures off the wall and <br/>\neverything to cover it).  Then I&#39;d have pots of paint and different <br/>\nsponges and brushes, and when he came in, I&#39;d just be painting <br/>\naway in one corner of the paper.  I know my kids wouldn&#39;t be able <br/>\nto resist picking up a brush, especially if this paper covered a <br/>\nwhole wall and they could really get wild with their painting. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that just some stuff I would do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJudie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Judie C.
