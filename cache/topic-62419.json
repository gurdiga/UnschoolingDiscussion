We stay up all night and  <br/>\n have our first fire in the fireplace that night (the longest night of  <br/>\n the year). We eat roasted nuts and seeds and dried fruits and other  <br/>\n goodies - and bake potatoes in the fire. We play Persian folklore music  <br/>\n in the background and sometimes dance a little. We sometimes do some  <br/>\n kind of little crafts related to Persian culture - like one year we  <br/>\n painted miniature paintings - another year we did some weaving, etc.  <br/>\n But the main thing we do is that my husband tells stories - the old  <br/>\n legends and mythology of the Persians. We have some good books, in  <br/>\n English, too - so when he&#39;s too tired, I read aloud from those -  <br/>\n Persian fairy tales, etc. It is so nice - we never make it all night -  <br/>\n but we always pretend we&#39;re going to. Then we all end up sleeping on  <br/>\n the floor or couch together in the living room. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds so lovely Pam.<br/>\nWonderful traditions.....<br/>\nI&#39;d like to incorporate more of my own culture into our traditions, it&#39;s <br/>\nsomething I need to learn more about.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.
