Several of them are<br/>\n&gt;currently struggling with school and learning issues with their kids. As I<br/>\n&gt;read of their trials I keep saying to myself, &quot;homeschooling would solve<br/>\n&gt;this problem.&quot; Most of them are totally unfamiliar with homeschooling and,<br/>\n&gt;in addition, were themselves all very academically driven and successful and<br/>\n&gt;are, for the most part, pretty high achievers in their professional lives.<br/>\n&gt;All of which means that they have certain biases, having been so successful<br/>\n&gt;at school themselves, but are also open-minded, good at research and open to<br/>\n&gt;new ideas, and want the best for their kids (really the best, not just the<br/>\n&gt;&quot;best&quot; schools and the &quot;best&quot; jobs.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So here&#39;s the question (sorry, I do tend to be long-winded): What titles<br/>\n&gt;would you all recommend for someone who is just beginning to learn about<br/>\n&gt;homeschooling? I have a shelf full of books on the subject, but am having a<br/>\n&gt;hard time picking out the two or three that would best introduce the idea to<br/>\n&gt;someone for whom it is brand new.

I  participate in an parenting listserve<br/>\nassociated with my college. It&#39;s  good bunch of people. Several of them are<br/>\ncurrently struggling with school and learning issues with their kids. As I<br/>\nread of their trials I keep saying to myself, &quot;homeschooling would solve<br/>\nthis problem.&quot; Most of them are totally unfamiliar with homeschooling and,<br/>\nin addition, were themselves all very academically driven and successful and<br/>\nare, for the most part, pretty high achievers in their professional lives.<br/>\nAll of which means that they have certain biases, having been so successful<br/>\nat school themselves, but are also open-minded, good at research and open to<br/>\nnew ideas, and want the best for their kids (really the best, not just the<br/>\n&quot;best&quot; schools and the &quot;best&quot; jobs.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here&#39;s the question (sorry, I do tend to be long-winded): What titles<br/>\nwould you all recommend for someone who is just beginning to learn about<br/>\nhomeschooling? I have a shelf full of books on the subject, but am having a<br/>\nhard time picking out the two or three that would best introduce the idea to<br/>\nsomeone for whom it is brand new. Also, what two or three websites would you<br/>\nmost recommend to help open their eyes to the possibilities of<br/>\nhomeschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all for your advice,<br/>\n<br/>\nAshley, in Northern California, mom to Willis, 5, and Frances, 2<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Samantha Stopple","from":"Samantha Stopple &lt;sammimag@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"QhUpFvasim7vmy4zJd5gW3cg34193eJHxJG9wRLwSLCvR2KbmzB-lilH99_u-j1P7XKB_DnkGgmg_6i65y0Fl4C5IV0C1vy-Vv_fAw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: gifted and passions","postDate":"979319501","msgId":15040,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwMTEyMTcxMTQxLjEzOTU5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMzMDMubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":15039,"nextInTopic":15045,"prevInTime":15039,"nextInTime":15041,"topicId":15039,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She liked taking the time to figure<br/>\nit all out. But her mother maybe thinking she was<br/>\nhelping maybe not discouraged her and encourage her<br/>\nmusically gifted child. Maybe we have a fear if a<br/>\nchild struggles with something that they are wasting<br/>\ntheir time and they should find something that they do<br/>\neasily. Or if they work hard on something that to our<br/>\nown eyes they struggle with they are wasting their<br/>\ntime not finding their gifts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t think how many times as I grew older that I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t take up new things because I thought my<br/>\nlearning time for it was over because I could never be<br/>\na &#39;professional&#39; at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also didn&#39;t do a lot of things I wanted to do for<br/>\nfun that if I had my life to live over again I would.<br/>\nI&#39;ve always wanted to work in a coffee shop. I have<br/>\nwanted to work in a bakery and as a naturalist in a<br/>\npark. Or heck maybe I will do it. I&#39;ll just have to do<br/>\nit when my kids are a little more independent. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nSamantha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

But in my own life, I have<br/>\n&gt; found that the things I am good at (NB I am no way gifted at anything),<br/>\n&gt; are not necessarily the things I am passionate about. I&#39;m sure that a<br/>\n&gt; lot of my depression over the years has been because I have been pushed<br/>\n&gt; towards the things that came easily, and away from the things I really<br/>\n&gt; wanted to do even though they didn&#39;t come naturally or well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oooh, this is SUCH an important point, especially as it related to the whole<br/>\n&quot;giftedness&quot; thing.

Why does it matter so much that things are done<br/>\nquickly, easily, or perfectly, instead of that they are done joyfully,<br/>\npassionately, and enduringly?? My college swim coach put a huge emphasis on<br/>\nlove of the sport, and taught me that an enduring love of swimming,<br/>\nexercise, and having a healthy body were much more important than winning<br/>\nsome tin medal in a competition that no-one would remember once it was over.<br/>\nHe was so right about this, as about so many life lessons he taught me.<br/>\nWhile many of my fellow swim team members who had been pushed to excel from<br/>\nvery young ages (some started on swim teams at age 4!?!) were just going<br/>\nthrough the motions, I who had walked on to the swim team at age 20 with no<br/>\ncompetitive experience was just feeling the blossoming of a life passion.<br/>\nMost likely, very few of them continue to swim, but for me it is an ongoing<br/>\nlove that I make sure I practice weekly. So while I was not a &quot;successful&quot;<br/>\nswimmer in that I didn&#39;t win very many medals, I have a wonderful passion<br/>\nfor swimming that will endure my whole life and keep my body strong and<br/>\nlimber, and in good health. How do we define success? As unschoolers, our<br/>\ngreatest gift is that we can re-define it to help our children become people<br/>\nwho are not hindered in their pursuit of their life&#39;s passions by someone<br/>\nelse&#39;s definitions of success.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n  -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;An archeologist is someone interested in old<br/>\nbones, like Grandma&#39;s!!&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) who her brother calls &quot;turbo baby&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15110,"nextTopicId":15092}}
