She was almost 4, and her grandma died.  She had gone to the funeral home to see Grandma at a viewing or funeral, and had apparently been told G&#39;ma had gone to heaven.  The next time we drove past the funeral home on our way somewhere else, she excitedly pointed out to Andy &#39;that&#39;s heaven -- it&#39;s where my grandma is.&#39;  I had quite a time explaining to them both that it was the funeral home, heaven was somewhere else entirely. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen my oldest was almost 5, an aunt of mine died very suddenly (also quite young).  He didn&#39;t really process things right away, but seemed to grasp it slowly.  Several months later his pre-school teacher confided to me that he had told her about his thought on heaven and how nice it must be for everyone with his Aunt Susie there.  Then, several months later his pet mouse died and he was devastated --  I think he was just finally grieving the earlier loss, in that now he understood death as permanent.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBy the time we were facing my grandma&#39;s death 8 yrs later, he was able to appreciate how precious time with her was before she died.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

I&#39;m not quite so sure <br/>\nabout that. My daughter who is 4 now, has been to three funerals in <br/>\nthe past year for her grandpa, grandma and uncle. She was actually <br/>\npresent when grandma died (the whole family was bedside). She <br/>\nunderstands that these people are gone but clearly does not have a <br/>\nfirm grasp on what death is. How can a young child who doesn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand death, understand make-believe or reality? <br/>\n<br/>\n2nd thought-I personally don&#39;t like saying &quot;they&#39;ve gone to heaven/be <br/>\nwith the angels/to a better place&quot; because for one, I&#39;ve heard <br/>\nchildren regurgitate this and they clearly don&#39;t know what they&#39;re <br/>\ntalking about. And for another, &quot;a better place&quot; implies that we are <br/>\nliving somewhere second best right now. <br/>\n<br/>\n3rd thought- We have told our 4 year old (3 at the time of the deaths) <br/>\nthat these people are gone forever (she is just now understanding <br/>\nyesterday, today, tomorrow). She seems to accept this and understand <br/>\nit to some extent, but she also thinks these people live in the ground <br/>\nat the cemetery. So we have tried telling her that the body dies and <br/>\ngoes away but the spirit stays forever inside all of us. That when she <br/>\nlaughs, she sounds like grandma; when she draws, her skill comes from <br/>\ngrandpa; that we all have little bits of each other inside ourselves <br/>\nand that is what spirit is. This is one thing she does seem to <br/>\nunderstand quite well. She will say &quot;I have the same smile as Uncle <br/>\nPaul&quot; &quot;I sleep just like daddy&quot;.....she really does sleep in the same <br/>\nmanner as daddy ever since she was newborn! She loves looking at <br/>\nfamily photos and finding similarities. <br/>\n<br/>\n4th thought- I believed in Santa longer than several of my friends, I <br/>\nalso believed that the cowboys were really shot and dead at Knott&#39;s <br/>\nBerry Farm (a live act). Yet I remember around that time, knowing that <br/>\nanimals were dead if hit by cars and that I also had to stay out of <br/>\nthe street or I might die. What kind of perception of reality is that? <br/>\n<br/>\nI sincerely would like to read other people&#39;s thoughts on dealing with <br/>\ndeath and children. One thing I&#39;m fairly certain of is that there is <br/>\nno particular age or light bulb moment of understanding death. I do <br/>\nthink there are some things in life we grow into understanding over <br/>\ntime and some things we just can&#39;t ever totally understand. -Cynthia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98606,"nextTopicId":98612}}
