Be a Fundamentalist -- ensure that the Fun always comes<br/>\n| before the Mental. Realize that life is a situation comedy that<br/>\n| will never be canceled.  A laugh track has been provided and<br/>\n| the reason we are put in the material world is to get more<br/>\n| material.  Have a good laughsitive twice a day, which will<br/>\n| ensure regularity.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| 2. Remember that each of us has been given a special gift<br/>\n| just for entering, so you are already a winner!<br/>\n|<br/>\n| 3. The most powerful tool on the planet today is Tell-A-Vision.<br/>\n| That&#39;s where I tell a vision to you and you tell a vision to me.<br/>\n| That way, if we don&#39;t like the programming we&#39;re getting, we<br/>\n| can change the channel.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| 4. Life is like photography -- you use the negative to develop.<br/>\n| No matter what adversity you face, be reassured: --The positive aspects<br/>\nwill be<br/>\n| revealed with the BIG picture.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| 5. It is true: As we go through life thinking heavy thoughts,<br/>\n| thought particles tend to get caught between the ears and<br/>\n| cause a condition called &quot;truth decay&quot;. Be sure to use mental<br/>\n| floss twice a day, and when you&#39;re tempted to practice &#39;tantrum<br/>\n| yoga&#39;, remember what we teach in the Swami&#39;s Absurdiveness<br/>\n| Training Class:  DON&#39;T GET EVEN, GET ODD.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| 6. If we want world peace, we must let go of our attachments<br/>\n| and truly live like nomads. That&#39;s where I no mad at you and you<br/>\n| no mad at me.  That way there&#39;ll surely be nomadness on the<br/>\n| planet. Peace begins with each of us.  A little peace here, a little<br/>\n| peace there. Pretty soon all the peaces will fit together to make<br/>\n| one big peace everywhere.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| 7. I know great earth changes have been predicted for the<br/>\n| future, so if you&#39;re looking to avoid earthquakes my advice is<br/>\n| simple:  When you find a fault don&#39;t dwell on it.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| 8. There&#39;s no need to change the world. All we have to do is<br/>\n| toilet train the world and we&#39;ll never have to change it again.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| 9. If you&#39;re looking for the key to the Universe I&#39;ve got some<br/>\n| good news and some bad news. The bad news:  There is no<br/>\n| key to the Universe.  The good news:   It was never locked.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| 10. Finally, everything I&#39;ve told you is channeled. That way, if<br/>\n| you don&#39;t like it it&#39;s not my fault. But remember: Enlightenment<br/>\n| is not a bureaucracy, so you don&#39;t have to go through channels.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13479,"nextTopicId":13481}}
