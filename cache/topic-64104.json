A discussion group.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscussion involves two way communication.  Otherwise you simply sit read and <br/>\nget taught someone else&#39;s methods, just like in school, many times not <br/>\nknowing the how&#39;s and whys behind the lesson your read about and are trying <br/>\nto learn or implement.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as I&#39;ve seen here if you don&#39;t want to read it, hit the delete key.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t care if some choose to hit delete every time they see my screen name in <br/>\nan email. Won&#39;t bother me any.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 1100 people here.  I know others are afraid or too intimidated to <br/>\nask something or to then follow it up with a WHY.  I&#39;ve gotten private emails <br/>\ntoo. Doesn&#39;t bother me.  I am in charge or responding or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are in charge of your delete key.  You don&#39;t want to read what I type, <br/>\nuse it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am LEARNING, learning LOTS about unschooling and things that I can do <br/>\nbetter.  I am learning there are groups of people who threaten unschooling.  <br/>\nPeople need to be aware if what they are doing can be taken away.  It&#39;s <br/>\nimportant.  I&#39;m glad I asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m learning.  You don&#39;t learn without any feedback.  It might be just my <br/>\nlearning style but if my child approached me about a subject I would tell <br/>\nthem go read and read some more, then listen but don&#39;t speak, then after you <br/>\nare sure you know everything THEN I&#39;ll listen to what you have to say.  That <br/>\nisn&#39;t discussion.  It might be a form of learning but not one I recognize.  <br/>\nIf my child came to me excited about learning something they KNEW was going <br/>\nto make them a better person and change their lives I would want to hear <br/>\nabout it and if asked, tell they what I thought about this life changing <br/>\nthing they had found.  I&#39;d enjoy the experience WITH them, a two way <br/>\ninterchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s just ME.  Reading reading reading and listening might be the way <br/>\nto go. but if the reader and listener cannot comment on what she is hearing <br/>\nor reading to those who are the experts I&#39;m sure there are going to be <br/>\nmisinformed and take a lot longer than if she had asked questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nUse the delete key, I don&#39;t care, I really don&#39;t.  1100 people, some <br/>\nquestions are bound to be something someone else might want to <br/>\nanswer/hear/discuss.

Not ever or now being a christian, I was wondering how I got pulled into this thread. Meaning it was getting to me enough where I responded. It&#39;s not the whole christian thing that did it, or even the idea of prejudice. It&#39;s the whole &quot;if I were&quot; statement. That&#39;s what bothered me. I don&#39;t like when someone does it. Putting oneself in someone else&#39;s place to not understand but to state what they would do (and that usually means it would be better than what is being done already) is not fair.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can wonder out loud what I would do if I won the lotto, but to think what I would if I were another race or religion or even in a different circumstance is not fair as I see it. I just don&#39;t think anyone can really know what they would do as someone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly don&#39;t do it to my kids and don&#39;t like when someone does it to me. I guess maybe because my mom is still really good at that. &quot;Well you know if I were you I would blah blah blah&quot; Does&#39;t have a good taste. And it would feel the same if someone said &quot;if I were a 45 year old mother of 4 living in Florida I would......&quot; Same thing. If it&#39;s for fun, that&#39;s one thing, but to really speculate on what one would do is another.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully this will all look okay in the morning. It&#39;s a bit late, err.....early here now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64424,"nextTopicId":64815}}
