The programmers obviously thought of it<br/>\nbecause there was always a response to their action.  They have also starved<br/>\nthe fish in Sims and things like that.  They just want to see what happens<br/>\nreally and wouldn&#39;t starve their own fish on purpose.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHarvest Moon sounds like an game that would interest my girls.  I am sure<br/>\nthey&#39;d love to leave a chicken in town to starve.  ;0)<br/>\n <br/>\nAngela <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Fun In Violence","postDate":"1080063573","msgId":92215,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5OS4yNzdkZGRkZS4yZDkxZDA1NUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":92213,"nextInTopic":92220,"prevInTime":92214,"nextInTime":92216,"topicId":92213,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/23/04 10:22:51 AM, game-enthusiast@adelphia.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-366237300\">In a message dated 3/23/04 10:22:51 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;   They do respect what I say and if I <br/>\n<br/>\nsat them down and told them that it really made my friend <br/>\n<br/>\nuncomfortable, I am sure they would try and stop doing it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds worth doing.<br/>\nAnd maybe forward the e-mail you just sent us to your friend, and let her <br/>\nknow you&#39;re concerned on one level, and not ultimately worried on another.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly has had fun playing Harvest Moon &quot;wrong&quot; sometimes.

I almost died because back before I had <br/>\nchildren, if I had seen that behavior, I would have assumed they <br/>\nwere mimicking what they had learned at home.  Well, they certainly <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get that from me and I was horrified to think that someone <br/>\nmight think that.  Well, now I don&#39;t worry so much about what other <br/>\npeople think unless it is a friend and something the girls do makes <br/>\nthem feel uncomfortable.  That is the case concerning the following <br/>\nbehaviors that I would like some insight on.<br/>\n <br/>\n My sweet little girls (ages 7 and 9) have a bit of an off sense of <br/>\nhumor. (ok, a lot of an off sense of humor! LOL!)  For instance, <br/>\nwhen we first got the Sims games, while playing, a Sim accidentally <br/>\ncaught on fire while it was cooking and it died.  They thought it <br/>\nwas a riot that the grim reaper came and from that point on they <br/>\npurposely caught their sims on fire.  (made sure they had No cooking <br/>\nskill points so the fires would happen.)  They thought it was a riot <br/>\nand anything like this just cracks them up.  Of course, they shared <br/>\nthis information with their friend who is 9 and she thought it was <br/>\nhilarious too and she started doing the same thing.  I have <br/>\ncommented to the girls, as they burn their Sims, that &quot;that is just <br/>\nawful.&quot; (image running through my head of children growing up <br/>\nlacking empathy for others and other horrible thoughts.)  It does <br/>\nmake me feel bad that they think it&#39;s fun to torture their computer <br/>\npeople but I figure that is my issue so after several comments to <br/>\nthe effect that I thought it was awful, I stopped commenting on it <br/>\nand really let it go.  I know they like to get a rise out of me and <br/>\nthat is part of the fun of doing these things but I don&#39;t think that <br/>\nis their driving force..they just truly think it is funny.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlong the same lines, they have these beanie babies that they love <br/>\nand play with *every* day. (and have for three years)  But they <br/>\nthink it is really funny to do torturous things to them.  When I am <br/>\nbrushing their hair, if I snag a not, they punch Pellet (the <br/>\nbeanie)  and laugh.  And when they are playing with their friend <br/>\nthey make their Pellets do things that are against societies <br/>\nexpectations (like steal or kill) and then they punch them or beat <br/>\nthem and tell them they are bad.  Both of the girls and their friend <br/>\nthink this is *so* funny.  It does make me squirm inside sometimes <br/>\nbut I just bite my tongue and find something else to do other than <br/>\nfocus on it because they are really sweet girls and I know they <br/>\nwould never even cut in line, let alone hurt someone.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy friend has told me that she feels uncomfortable with this type of <br/>\nplay.  She asked me to help her come to grips with it as she <br/>\nrealizes the reason she feels uncomfortable are her issues.  I <br/>\nreally don&#39;t know what to tell her since it really makes me <br/>\nuncomfortable too.  My kids have re-assured me that they would never <br/>\ndo that to someone in real life and that Pellet isn&#39;t real and the <br/>\nSims aren&#39;t real.  And they would never even do it to the stuffed <br/>\nanimals that they take comfort in and cuddle.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy girls are generally seen by outsiders as quiet, shy girls.  They <br/>\nadore animals and we have many pets. They are gentle with all <br/>\nanimals and children.   They do like getting a rise or a laugh out <br/>\nof  people they are comfortable with and that is part of the reason <br/>\nthey do what they do.  (Can we shock Auntie? Or can we make Suzie <br/>\nlaugh?)  I talk to my girls about EVERYTHING and we don&#39;t have any <br/>\nhard fast rules at our house.  They do respect what I say and if I <br/>\nsat them down and told them that it really made my friend <br/>\nuncomfortable, I am sure they would try and stop doing it. (even <br/>\nthough they might not understand her concern)  BUT, they really have <br/>\na lot of fun doing these things and I hate to be a the poop in the <br/>\npunch bowl when they are just having fun and it really isn&#39;t hurting <br/>\nanyone. At the same time, I adore my friend and I want her to be <br/>\ncomfortable hanging out with us.  So, do you have any advice I can <br/>\nshare with my friend to help her through these feelings or do you <br/>\nfeel that I should talk to the girls about how it is making my <br/>\nfriend uncomfortable? <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nAngela <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92262,"nextTopicId":92229}}
