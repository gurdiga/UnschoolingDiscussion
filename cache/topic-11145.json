On Protein Power diet you don&#39;t have<br/>\nto watch your fat in take. I know because I lost 5 in<br/>\noff my waist alone (I didn&#39;t measure my tighs) in sex<br/>\nweeks. I had more energy and felt better than I had as<br/>\na teen. I actually got bored around my house. I did<br/>\nthis eating bacon, eggs, steak, etc. It does caution<br/>\nthe colleterol in eggs, the easy remedy is to eat more<br/>\nwhites than yolks. At bed time I always have a snack.<br/>\nI started eaging scrambled eggs instead of toast. I<br/>\nused 6 eggs and only 2 yolks so I ate no carbs at<br/>\nbedtime filled up on protein and wasn&#39;t worried about<br/>\nthe collesterol. For lunch I would often eat either<br/>\ntuna or egg salad. With the egg salad I would use the<br/>\n6 eggs again throwing away 4 yolks and put in celery<br/>\nand onion and whatever seasonings I wanted and serve<br/>\nit in a letuse bowl. With the tuna I would core out a<br/>\ntomato and fill it with the tuna  salad and then eat<br/>\nit like an apple. It was delicious.
