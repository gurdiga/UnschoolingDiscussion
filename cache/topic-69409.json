Trevor is really into world geography right now and has been <br/>\nplaying some free US and world games I downloaded at yourchildlearns.com. He <br/>\nknows where many obscure (at least to me!) world landmarks are and uses the <br/>\nworld map on the wall a lot. <br/>\n  We went to the Van Gogh exhibit at the art museum yesterday..really cool. <br/>\nOur tour guide was sorta dull but she did mention the red poppies that Van <br/>\nGogh included in some of his paintings and we had fun finding them. Trevor <br/>\ndidn&#39;t care much about all the paintings of fields but he really like the <br/>\nposter of The Starry Night we asw in the gift shop.<br/>\n  We&#39;re going to dissect our owl pellets this afternoon before I go into <br/>\nwork. <br/>\nAmy Kagey<br/>\nEmail me for a list <br/>\nof used homeschooling books!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69333,"nextTopicId":69391}}
