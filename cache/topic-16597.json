It has been a major hurdle to get used to my \nnew abilities (or lack of same).&nbsp; And don&#39;t even get me started on how the \ninsurance and medical establishment treats me!&nbsp; But that&#39;s not the \ntopic...back to the topic.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Century Gothic\">I think you handled it great!&nbsp; You have \nyour DD an opportunity to say &#39;hello&#39;, after giving a greeting yourself.&nbsp; \nThis is the absolute best example you could have set (IMO).&nbsp; It was \ncourteous, but not overbearing, it helped your children know how to act when \nconfronted with this situation in the future and was a kind response to the \nother people, showing general courtesy and patience.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Century Gothic\">A couple of tips from someone new to using a \nwheelchair.&nbsp; <font face=\"Century Gothic\">For starters, loneliness can be a \ndevastating condition to cope with.&nbsp; I have noticed that some people are \nnot at all sure how to approach me or whether I want to be bothered by their \npresence.&nbsp; I am sooo appreciative of the people who are able to greet ME, \nrather than worry about my chair.&nbsp; It is physically very difficult for me \nto &#39;work&#39; a room and get around to meet other people.&nbsp; However, that \ndoesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t want to know them.</font></font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Century Gothic\">I know it is frustrating for others who are \nhurrying on their way when they have to wait for me to cross a street or get \nthrough a doorway.&nbsp; A smile and a small greeting goes a long way to let me \nknow not to take it personally.&nbsp; (By the same token, I try to make eye \ncontact and greet others when they have wait around for me.)</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Century Gothic\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Century Gothic\">Holding doors open or other small gestures of \nassistance are welcome.&nbsp; At least for me, so are the questions asked by \nyoung children.&nbsp; I&#39;ve had a couple of situations where the parents were \nmortified because their young child was &#39;getting in my way&#39;.&nbsp; While I \nappreciate their consideration, I also love children and welcome their open \ncuriosity.&nbsp; I would rather that the parent get down closer to the child&#39;s \nlevel and assist the child in talking with me or asking questions outright about \nmy chair and/or my circumstances than to have them pulled away and have the \nparents wrestling to keep the young child under control.&nbsp; It amazes me what \ninterests the children about my chair...judging from the curiosity of children, \nI&#39;m sure I&#39;ve met a lot of budding engineers!&nbsp; Sure, it takes a few extra \nminutes to teach your children, but I think it&#39;s worth it.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Century Gothic\">Of&nbsp; course, it would not be appropriate to \nstop every handicapped/blind/less-abled person on the street and burden them \nwith a lot of questions!&nbsp; But to take a moment to allow your child to \nbecome more comfortable with the situation.&nbsp; I say, way to go, \nmom!</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Century Gothic\">I have an aunt who has down&#39;s syndrome.&nbsp; \nWe get some of the same reactions when we are out with her.&nbsp; It is obvious \nshe has a disability of some sort and people are not sure how to react, often \nchoosing to ignore her/us, rather than be bothered with \nconversation.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Century Gothic\">Now I&#39;m starting to ramble and that was not my \npoint.&nbsp; I think you did a good job in this situation.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Century Gothic\">FWIW,</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Century Gothic\">Eiraul</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mommiesapp@...\"\n title=\"mommiesapp@...\">mommiesapp@...</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> February 19, 2001 11:38 AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [Unschooling-dotcom] Need \n  opinions</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>My dh, son (1yo) and 3 yo dd were standing in line at a \n  restaurant waiting to <br>be seated for lunch.&nbsp;

The whole etiquette of not pointing <br/>\nand not talking loud enough for others to hear you ties in.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine who&#39;s a quadraplegic doesn&#39;t mind if kids ask her why she&#39;s <br/>\nin a wheelchair.  She said she&#39;d rather them ask than to just ignore her or <br/>\nact really weird.  But then she&#39;s talkative and neither a bitter person, nor <br/>\nmean, and she&#39;s able to respond.  Some people can&#39;t carry on a conversation, <br/>\nor wouldn&#39;t want to.  It&#39;s hard to guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nI volunteer information to my kids even when they haven&#39;t notices someone.  I <br/>\npointed out an anacephalic teen or young adult at the hardware store.  They <br/>\nwere looking at something else.  But I figured to describe the condition and <br/>\ntell them they&#39;d see more in their lives (which they have) and to say that <br/>\nsome babies are born with heads too big, and some with heads too small, and <br/>\nthat could have happened when I had babies but I was glad it didn&#39;t.  I <br/>\nhugged them and made it an opportunity for learning AND reassurance and <br/>\nsocial advisement.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"mommiesapp@cs.com","from":"mommiesapp@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"xQ-Lstmf2T83SayjnYi7-JK-gxxIqR-JFWUUme4E25M_SNW6gsJMUaNTr8CzxJgcgQAIHeZDcN4","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Need opinions","postDate":"982611480","msgId":16597,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEyLjEwNTE4MzI5LjI3YzJkMDE4QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16598,"prevInTime":16596,"nextInTime":16598,"topicId":16597,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey all!

I want to share a NEW situation I was in today and would like <br/>\nfeedback on how to handle this in the future...I&#39;m very open to any <br/>\nideas...thanks in advance:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh, son (1yo) and 3 yo dd were standing in line at a restaurant waiting to <br/>\nbe seated for lunch.  The door opened and a woman was helping her teenaged <br/>\ndaughter get in the door -- the daughter had some type of disorder/disease <br/>\nthat prevented her from walking &quot;normal&quot; and her mouth was sorta tight so <br/>\nwhen she spoke it was obvious somethig was wrong with her.  Needless to say <br/>\nmy daughter was GAWKING like I&#39;ve never seen her do before.  I glanced in the <br/>\ndirection of the mom/daughter, smiled and said hello.  I looked at my <br/>\ndaughter and said &quot;would you like to say &quot;hi&quot; and she sorta hid behind me <br/>\n(still gawking) and shook her head no.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we left the restaurant I explained to my daughter that not all people <br/>\nwalk and talk like us but they are still like us -- they like to eat out with <br/>\ntheir family, talk with new people, eat fun food, etc.  I guess my question <br/>\nis should I do more to get her to stop staring?  I assume this young woman <br/>\nwas probably used to young children staring but it seems as though she (and <br/>\nothers) would get tired of it.  I have successfully (I think!) explained <br/>\nwalkers, cains, and wheelchairs and why people use them and my daughter <br/>\nunderstands and will easily greet people who use them.  This situation was <br/>\nvery different...I was especially worried because my daughter did NOT ask me <br/>\na ton of questions like normal.  Hmmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m starting to ramble...I just don&#39;t know what I should do (if <br/>\nanything) differently the next time something like this takes place.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWould love to hear what others have to say on this.  Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle in DE</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16691,"nextTopicId":16694}}
