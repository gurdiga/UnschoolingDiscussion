She went with us loaded down with her academic books from a <br/>\nhomeschooling co-op which included<br/>\nAnatomy and Phisiology, Geometry, and World History.  She truly came home a <br/>\nchanged child.  She quit the co-op and those textbooks are gathering dust . She <br/>\nread Grace Llewlyns &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;,  made a quilt with <br/>\nquilting pieces from the conference raffle, started sculpting,  became very involved <br/>\nin photography, planted strawberry corn, which is in pots all over our house, <br/>\nin preparation for a small green house she is designing,  went back to writing <br/>\npoetry(which is all over her bedroom floor), decided to direct a play this <br/>\nspring and has found the play and a facility as well as a group of homeschoolers <br/>\nto act in it, became interested in vegetarian cooking and made a wonderful <br/>\ndinner for us all last night.  She and I took a wheel building class and learned <br/>\nto throw pots that we gave friends and family for Christmas gifts.  I <br/>\ncontinue to just be in awe of her enthusiasm, energy and the joy she brings to her <br/>\ndays.  She has always been very self-directed and has homeschooled since she was <br/>\n8 but her energies went into &quot;school-like&quot; pursuits.  There was very little <br/>\nof the joyfulness evident that I now see in her every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning , she has discovered boxes of pictures that I never got into <br/>\nalbums and is working on a scrapbook  of her life so far.  She is also involved <br/>\nin community theatre and enjoys public speaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenna asked if you could e-mail her as she would love to be involved in any <br/>\nway at the Live and Learn Conference this year.  We will definitely be there.  <br/>\nAfter the changes in our lives from last year, I wouldn&#39;t miss it for <br/>\nanything.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer e-mail is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brennadee@...\">brennadee@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGail<br/>\n(who now even drives around with unschooling bumper stickers in our extremely <br/>\nconservative and religious homeschool community)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Digest Number 4354","postDate":"1073450945","msgId":88043,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI5LjNiMjQ4YTkwLjJkMmNlOWMxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":88042,"nextInTopic":88115,"prevInTime":88042,"nextInTime":88044,"topicId":88042,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/6/2004 10:40:44 PM Eastern Standard Time, UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com writes: Seems to me one of the etiquette ladies, maybe","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-265069991\">In a message dated 1/6/2004 10:40:44 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\nSeems to me one of the etiquette ladies, maybe Miss<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Manners, said there&#39;s no<br/>\n&gt; need to write a thank you note if you&#39;ve said thank<br/>\n&gt; you in person.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Might be worth finding her book and copying the<br/>\n&gt; page! ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Joyce<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s true, and if I can do it without upsetting her, I<br/>\nmight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe really is a wonderful person and usually so<br/>\nsupportive that she just caught me on a day when I had<br/>\nvery little sleep all week and was quite worried about<br/>\nthe 5yo being sick (we thought he had an appendicitis<br/>\nbut turned out to have an impacted bowel) but holding<br/>\nall my worries in so as not to worry the children (or<br/>\nher and my dad).

LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise I would have just blown it off as being her<br/>\nold-fashioned southern upbringing (she is 69 after<br/>\nall) would have made a joke about it and told her we<br/>\nwould get around to it eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think my 5yos take on the whole thing was way<br/>\nfunnier.  ;-)<br/>\n***************************<br/>\nMaybe she really wants something tangible from the kids that she can hold and <br/>\nkeep?
