All it is is asking questions. He can ask his friends&#39; mothers why they do not homeschool. Help him learn to ask it in a non-agressive and considerate way. He can keep track of the answers. There is not one single answer and he can learn this, too.<br/>\nLet him keep a spiral notebook with his questions and he can record them as they occur. I believe this comes under research, too. He is never too young to start!<br/>\nTO:&quot;Marsha Griffith&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wvmom1@...\">wvmom1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTake advantage of your ability to be a unique family. In public school it would not be so easy because of dark looks, comments from kids, etc. not to mention a teacher who just might glance askew at the arrangement!<br/>\nTO: Mary E Gates &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:megates@...\">megates@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nWe go along blindly doing what most peopledo without thinking long and hard to learn all the pros and cons, beforedeciding what really might be best for our family (and periodicallyreevaluating).<br/>\nYes, we often just let life happen to us rather than making those choices we can make. Others, family, \u0013experts,\u0014 and people who are leaders just push or pull us down a path not of our own making!<br/>\nTO:&quot;Joseph A. & Susan D. Fuerst&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuerst@...\">fuerst@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nThat is something I could never understand \u0016 wanting to get away from your children. I enjoyed mine and they went just about everywhere I went. We were together at all times when I was not at work. As to hs being limiting, well, I do not have to be at school at 8 and at school at 3. I can go anywhere and take my granddaughter with me. It is all part of her education. We have a ball and see and learn a lot in addition to \u0013lessons.\u0014 There is no such thing as wasting a college education. Nothing is wated. The children are the MOST important thing we will ever influence!<br/>\nTO: Lisa Fuller &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eifuller@...\">eifuller@...</a>&gt; wrote: \u0013With every class I learn so much about myown beliefs and theories. The more I learn about unschooling, too, the more I&#39;let go&#39; in the classroom and let the students lead discussions and teach theclass. I&#39;m rejuvenated every time I step into the classroom.\u0014<br/>\nBRAVO. Unfortunately, this is frowned upon in public schools of my experience! I too have taught all ages from very young to adult. There is very little teaching, but if you can allow them to learn, you have done the best that can be done! Somewhere between birth and about 10 years old, something happens to children to make them say things like, \u0013I\u0012m bored,\u0014 or \u0013I hate school,\u0014 or \u0013I hate math.\u0014 It is connected to public schools. So if all we do is stay out of their way and give them what help and encouragement we can, we have done a lot!<br/>\nTO: Melanie Shimokawa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sfamily@...\">sfamily@...</a>&gt; wrote: \u0013She did all her workwhile we were at school, and we never knew what she did.

Let the children see what different jobs are all about, too. Many of the children are just as ignorant about ALL jobs! We have been to many places and seen what goes on behind the scenes!<br/>\nTO: List. I promise not to mess up like this again and take up all this space!
