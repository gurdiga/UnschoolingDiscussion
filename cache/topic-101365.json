That makes me so mad and upset and then I start to think that maybe I am doing her wrong (but for 9 years now I know different)We are new to Florida and she will be starting Scouts and I start to think Gosh what if they want her to read ( she can but really doesn&#39;t like to , it takes her longer cause she is dyslexic), I don&#39;t want her to feel bad about herself, I know in my heart that but the time she has to make her way in the world she will know all she needs but I just have a hard time every now and then with the &quot;rest&quot; of the world. I wish I knew some unschoolers that lived near me, I would for a while just hang with them until I get used to Unschooling in this state and get to know some people.

It&#39;s this notion of how being<br/>\naround schooled (or school-at-home) kids can make us feel inadequate, or<br/>\nscared as you put it. Sometimes it goes further and makes our kids start to<br/>\ndoubt themselves and their futures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times when I want to say stay away from them for a while, during<br/>\ntransitioning to Unschooling, or particularly vulnerable times - like the<br/>\nbeginning of puberty perhaps. I&#39;m not sure whether this is always feasible<br/>\nor desirable - after all Unschoolers usually don&#39;t force our children to<br/>\nisolate themselves from their friends. But boy, there are times when it&#39;s<br/>\ntempting and might make us feel better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes feel these pressures myself. Just yesterday at Park Day some of<br/>\nthe H/S mothers were talking about some history curriculum on DVD, that<br/>\ntheir really young (4,5,6 yo) kids were &quot;really enjoying&quot;. Jayn shows no<br/>\ninterest in history, except the idea of the magical olden days when<br/>\nPrincesses lived in castles. I, yes even I, felt a gentle brush of anxiety.<br/>\nWhich is way better than a deep and painful panicky stab of anxiety as I<br/>\nmight have felt a couple of years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn occasions when schooled kids seem to be &quot;advanced&quot; it is helpful to focus<br/>\nonly on our child&#39;s strengths and individuality, and remember that she has a<br/>\nwhole lifetime to learn whatever she wants to. It isn&#39;t a competition. Maybe<br/>\nthis is one time when some school bashing is in order ;) - these kids may<br/>\nseem &quot;advanced&quot; but how much of it will they recall after the end of year<br/>\ntests are done? The schooled kids are being scaled against an average. It is<br/>\nhelpful to remember that averages are created out of combining every number,<br/>\nincluding the extremes at either end, and while helpful in looking at<br/>\npopulations, are not useful predictors of individual performance. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it would be reassuring to picture our children as completely outside<br/>\nof the &quot;average scale&quot;, to picture them strolling back and forth past the<br/>\nline of other &quot;graded&quot; people at will. There is no real reason to assume<br/>\nthat any of these kids will end up happier, kinder, more confident, or more<br/>\n&quot;educated&quot; than any of our sons and daughters. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

She doesn&#39;t care a thing in the world about math (just does very simple adding and subtracting) does not spell good at all and really doesn&#39;t care to read, doesn&#39;t like history...I get myself scared about her , that ,and I am not a good speller and it makes me feel &quot;not very smart&quot; at times. She is dyslexic so I did not push her in these area&#39;s. I guess I get &quot;scared&quot; when other kids her age come around and I see how advanced they are and I feel like I am doing her wrong even though I know how much she hated doing &quot;school&quot;. The one thing she is interested in is making maps...maps of her room maps of our neighborhood, she loves to decorate, and she is very very good at planning parties. Its when I start to make the map making &quot;schoolesh&quot; she turns off, I thought she could learn some math with the map making, you know measuring and such but she just doesn&#39;t care.Please help me to learn to trust that she will be OK. Does anyone else have a child who doesn&#39;t really care about learning much of anything?<br/>\nThanks for all the help,<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\n&quot;--- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Shannon Rizzo <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, November 23, 2004 1:24 PM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Maslow<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If he can&#39;t feel when he&#39;s full, they really should get him tested to rule<br/>\n  out Prader-Willi Syndrome, as Debbie mentioned.
