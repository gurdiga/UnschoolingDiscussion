This <br/>\nconversation is very timely because dh and I have been talking it <br/>\nthrough.  The level of messiness bothers him a lot.  He pointed out <br/>\nthat when I do a big cleanup of a room I throw a lot away, sometimes <br/>\nthrowing away as much garbage as I pick up toys.  He wants to go to <br/>\nthe kids and ask if we could at least just throw away garbage when <br/>\nwe&#39;re done with it.  Not just them, but all of us, for the purpose of <br/>\nthe whole household running more smoothly.  *I* sometimes don&#39;t throw <br/>\naway a wrapper when I&#39;m done with it right away but wait until a <br/>\ncleanup session and clean it all up, but that doesn&#39;t work anymore <br/>\nwith 5 people leaving stuff behind, because it&#39;s me being the one to <br/>\ngo behind and do huge cleanup sessions for everyone and it&#39;s just too <br/>\nmuch for one person.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI asked him what we will do if we remind them and they say, &quot;No, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to throw it away&quot; or &quot;You do it for me&quot;, and he said he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know.  They don&#39;t respond that way to them, at least not very <br/>\noften.  They&#39;re more likely to respond that way to me.  He pointed <br/>\nout that when he takes them swimming, they all just take the noodles <br/>\nand pool equipment out of the pool when they&#39;re done.  When they <br/>\nfinish riding their bikes, they just automatically bring their bikes <br/>\nup onto the sidewalk or at least ask an adult to help them do it. No <br/>\none makes them do those things, no one threatens or yells or sets up <br/>\nchore charts or anything to get them to do it, they just do because <br/>\nof the matter of fact way he has of &quot;let&#39;s put all the toys from the <br/>\npool up on the deck&quot; way that he has.  So why do they just leave <br/>\ngarbage all over the place in the house?  Probably my bad example and <br/>\nmy needing to learn more about not setting myself up as servant.  Not <br/>\nthat mothers shouldn&#39;t serve their kids, but in my desparate attempts <br/>\nto be the perfect mother I somehow managed to portray too much of a <br/>\nservant-view of myself to the point where they didn&#39;t know who I was <br/>\nor what I was interested in because all I did was serve them and <br/>\nignore my own needs.  But healing and balance is happening, and it&#39;s <br/>\nnice to see progress being made. :)  So anyway, I said to dh that it <br/>\nmight be better if *he* be the one to do most of the reminding about <br/>\nthrowing trash away for awhile at least, because he&#39;s more natural <br/>\nabout it.  He understands the reason because we&#39;ve talked it through <br/>\nthoroughly and he&#39;s willing to not yell and scream and threaten <br/>\nbecause he sees clearly now where the problem started and what needs <br/>\nto be done to get us back on the right track.

We&#39;ve worked this out, mostly.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have someone come and clean most of the house (just not the <br/>\nbedrooms because we&#39;re never in them except to sleep, so they don&#39;t <br/>\nget dirty very quickly). They come every two weeks. The best part <br/>\nabout it for me is that I&#39;m motivated to pick up the living room and <br/>\nkitchen so that they can clean the whole rug, etc.! <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe when I grow up I&#39;ll learn to motivate myself, but for now, I&#39;m <br/>\nokay with the outside motivation of dh&#39;s wants and the cleaning <br/>\nservice&#39;s need. Since I stopped even asking ds to clean up with me, <br/>\nbut mentioned the &quot;clean slate&quot; concept, he&#39;s occasionally really <br/>\nhelpful and often a bit helpful. Dd seems to have gotten dh&#39;s <br/>\ncleaning genes, but maybe she&#39;ll grow out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, all my &quot;things work well here&quot; bs is from before I got <br/>\npregnant. Now (12 weeks and 3 days, but who&#39;s counting) the place is <br/>\nso messy I can barely stand it. I do have a need to not step on toys <br/>\nall the time.

I personally believe that home schooling in part is about basic home making skills, and that includes cleaning. I make cleaning a viable home school activity in my home. I tell my two teens that these *are* their chores for the day. If they do not do them they lose basic privileges. I have even gone to the extent of making them lose their right to eat if they do not do what they are supposed to. The fact is learning to take care of one&#39;s home is the first step to self responsibility, and I cannot see that it is not an imperative life skill. I think we rob them of the opportunity to be self reliant if we do everything for them, and we teach them that others are there to merely *serve* them. I have used the approach of *you earn what you get* since they were very young, but it is something that requires constant reinforcement. It may seem tiring after a time reinforcing, and you feel like you would just rather do it yourself, but eventually it will pay off. My son did the dishes badly on purpose for several years, figuring it would get him out of doing them. Eventually though he came to realize that it was he that was suffering also in doing so! He now does them quite well, and he really does care. The lack of children caring about their immediate environ is surely indicative that they are feeling a lack of self esteem in themselves, and it is important to really be encouraging and supportive in all that they do right. I have found nagging does not work, only action...immediate action. Do it, or else...and stick to the *or else*. As soon as you give them a way out, they will take it. Eventually they will find it takes more effort to not do what they should be doing, than doing the act it&#39;s self. Children need some measure of discipline, and eventually it will engrain enough into them that it is no longer needed to such a degree. I often utilize a message board, and list the daily chores there. Also, it is important to give a time period that is acceptable to get them done. For example, all chores must be done by 5 p.m., etc.                           Blessings & Namaste!<br/>\n                                                -Angel <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Not even close.

Maybe it&#39;s more of a personality thing?  I think some <br/>\nwomen have more of a &quot;nesting&quot; instinct.  I remember being at a <br/>\nChristian women&#39;s conference and they were talking about how women <br/>\nhave a natural instinct to &quot;nest&quot; by having things &quot;just so&quot; in their <br/>\nhouse, but men just drop thing wherever and don&#39;t care about their <br/>\natmosphere.  That&#39;s a bit of a stereotype but it does seem to have a <br/>\nlot of truth to it when I look at irl women I know.  I know LOTS of <br/>\nwomen who just can&#39;t rest or think in a house that&#39;s messy.  But <br/>\nsomehow I seemed to miss out on some of that &quot;nesting&quot; instinct.  I <br/>\nwould like it to not be messy, but I&#39;m not willing or able to do the <br/>\namount of work required to keep things neat all the time.  I would <br/>\nlove to challenge flylady to come to my home and keep up with my <br/>\nboys&#39; messes. ;)  But her solution would probably be to constantly <br/>\ntell them they can&#39;t make such big messes.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Not even close.

I&#39;m seriously considering it.  <br/>\nOnce a week maybe, just to scrub down the kitchen and diningroom <br/>\nreally well.  Other rooms would be too hard for a cleaning person to <br/>\ndo, because the problem is stuff--toys and papers and stuff that no <br/>\none outside of the family would know what to do with it all. For <br/>\nexample, I know that the yellow construction paper that&#39;s been run <br/>\nthrough the shredder is Luke&#39;s &quot;spaghetti&quot;, but a cleaning lady might <br/>\nthink it&#39;s garbage and throw it away.  But if the kitchen and <br/>\ndiningroom got done really well once a week, that would be really <br/>\nnice and would free up more of my time as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom recently hired someone to help her clean her house and she&#39;s <br/>\nhappy with her, so last night I emailed her and asked her for the <br/>\nname and number of the person who cleans for her.   I&#39;ve wanted to <br/>\nfor awhile but didn&#39;t out of guilt, feeling that I should be able to <br/>\nhandle cleaning and that it&#39;s not showing my kids how to live in the <br/>\nreal world if they don&#39;t see me doing all the cleaning myself, etc.  <br/>\nBut now I&#39;m at the point where I figure that my family and I have <br/>\nLOTS of strengths.  Cleaning and not being messy just aren&#39;t among <br/>\nthose strengths.  Some people ARE really good at it, and want to earn <br/>\nmoney doing it, so by hiring them we&#39;re supporting them and helping <br/>\nourselves too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are really messy too.  So messy that they can make messes in <br/>\n1/2 an hour that take me at least 3 hours to clean up.  Seriously.  <br/>\nFor example, when I was packing the car for the conference I needed <br/>\nthe stapler to staple my mapquest directions.  It wasn&#39;t on the <br/>\nshelf.  So I asked the boys where it was and they said it was in <br/>\ntheir &quot;library&quot;.  They had been playing library and had assorted <br/>\npaper, staples, pens, tape, etc. by a bookshelf.  There were at least <br/>\n100 kids&#39; books all over the floor in that area and it took me an <br/>\nhour to put them back on the shelf, sort garbage paper from paper <br/>\nthat can still be used, etc. until I made my way far enough into the <br/>\npile to find the stapler.  They probably had been playing library for <br/>\nan hour and I spent an hour cleaning up enough to find the stapler <br/>\nand never did get it cleaned up before the conference (and STILL <br/>\nhaven&#39;t gotten it cleaned up and now there&#39;s more mess added to the <br/>\nroom.)  Now added to that in addition to the usual array of toys, <br/>\npapers, magazines etc strewn around the floor, is yarn.  Lots and <br/>\nlots of yarn, because they tied the room up in a &quot;spider web&quot; and <br/>\nwhen they were done they cut the spider web apart and left the string <br/>\nthere.  If I ask them to help me clean the stuff up they usually say <br/>\nno, no matter how joyfully I ask them.  So it stays a mess or I stay <br/>\nup real late or get up real early to get it done, and I get tired and <br/>\ncranky.  Adding a 1 year old lab puppy who joyfully plays with two <br/>\nyoung boys doesn&#39;t help keep things neat either.  The mess my boys <br/>\ncan make is magnified considerably when they start playing with the <br/>\ndog.  It&#39;s unbelievable, because of course when that dog gets excited <br/>\nand runs around, just his wagging tail can wipe everything off of the <br/>\ncoffeetable in 5 seconds! lol Give them half an hour and the room is <br/>\ntrashed.  I&#39;m just hoping that as they get older they&#39;ll start making <br/>\nless messes.  When they&#39;re 15 and 17, maybe they won&#39;t find joy in <br/>\nturning styrofoam into snow that covers the whole downstairs. &lt;g&gt;  If <br/>\n*I* can last that long!   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s interesting that you think your messes are because you&#39;re not at <br/>\nhome (different kinds of messes I realize, because your kids are of <br/>\ndifferent ages and genders and personalities), because for awhile I <br/>\nthought my solution would be trying to get them out more where they <br/>\ncould make messes and it wouldn&#39;t require hours and hours of cleaning <br/>\nafterwards.  Like outdoors places to play with rocks and sticks and <br/>\nleaves that it didn&#39;t matter where they ended up, or maybe going <br/>\nfrequently to playgrounds or children&#39;s museums.  But they don&#39;t <br/>\nreally want much of that--they make themselves pretty clear that they <br/>\njust want to be home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo my current hope for staying sane is the possibility of hiring <br/>\nsomeone once a week. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: money & kids","postDate":"1094327581","msgId":99059,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxM0ExRDFELjUwODA3MDJAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEIwMUI5NEQ2LUZFQTItMTFEOC1CN0M1LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQwOTAzMTcxODQ0LjQ3NDI1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjIwNzA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPiA8MDA2ODAxYzQ5MjExJGQ0ZWIzNDYwJDk1NGNkZTE4QGFvbGRzbC5uZXQ+IDw2LjEuMi4wLjAuMjAwNDA5MDMyMDAwNDMuMGEwNWQ5YjhAc210cC5tYWJiLm5ldD4gPDAwM2IwMWM0OTI5NiQ1NDZjMjYyMCQwMjAwYThjMEB5b3VybzBrd2t3OWp3Yz4gPEIwMUI5NEQ2LUZFQTItMTFEOC1CN0M1LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":99058,"nextInTopic":99060,"prevInTime":99058,"nextInTime":99060,"topicId":99024,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** Not even close.

Our 13 yo works for us.  We were<br/>\nlooking into hiring a cleaning person when I became pregnant so that I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have to think about such things.  After a few interviews he<br/>\ncame to us and proposed that we give him the job.  He had a whole list<br/>\nof reasons why he would be better than a stranger.  He now cleans 2<br/>\nmornings a week and we pay him 100.00 a month (works out to about 8.50<br/>\nan hr depending on how he feels that day).  This is his money.  We pay<br/>\nfor all his extracurricular stuff, clothing, fun stuff, etc.Though, he<br/>\nis going to Italy in March and we&#39;ve asked him to raise the money he<br/>\nwill need for food and spending.  That is only about 1/3 of the cost of<br/>\nthe trip, so not totally unrealistic.  We would pay for it all, only we<br/>\ncan&#39;t really even afford the trip to begin with, so any help he can give<br/>\nwill make our financial lives easier.  We don&#39;t give our children an<br/>\nallowance only because we are very bad at remembering such things.  They<br/>\njust get what they need/want (within reason) when it arises.  If he ever<br/>\nwants to stop being the cleaning person he is free to do so and I remind<br/>\nhim of this often, especially when he seems to be dragging his feet and<br/>\nnot really wanting to do the work.<br/>\nJust my .02.  I&#39;ll go back to feeling out the list now and send an intro<br/>\nin a few days.<br/>\nWith care,<br/>\nAngel<br/>\n <br/>\n&#39;Many would sooner die than think.

I get money by getting up, going to<br/>\nwork, doing my job, and then coming home and preparing for the next<br/>\nday. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, for us the money that comes in is family money and they are part of<br/>\nthe family so we share.  I do lots of work around the house, though I am not<br/>\npaid for any of it.  If my husband, as the person earning the money, had a<br/>\nlist of things that I had to get done that week before I could have any<br/>\nmoney to spend at my discretion, I&#39;d be pretty resentful.  I&#39;d look at the<br/>\njobs as painful duties to get done.  It takes away my choice to do those<br/>\ntasks of my own volition and for my own motivations ... it would kill the<br/>\njoy of participating in the household.<br/>\n<br/>\nTying allowance to chores makes the tasks seem icky and something to avoid,<br/>\nnot as things that help the household run more smoothly.  Maybe the<br/>\nbathrooms or the vacuuming can slide for another few days in favour of<br/>\nsomething else.  It helps them see that work around the home can be done<br/>\nwhen a person sees it needs doing and they choose to do it.  Not to do it<br/>\njust because it&#39;s Saturday or just because if they don&#39;t then they don&#39;t get<br/>\ntheir allowance.  That&#39;s just not &quot;reality&quot;.  When they have their own apt /<br/>\nhome they don&#39;t *have to* do the household tasks on Saturday (or whatever<br/>\nday).  And nobody is going to pay them to get them done.  I look at my<br/>\nmotivations for getting stuff done around the house and try to share that<br/>\nwith them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the money/allowance itself, with no strings attached, gives them the<br/>\nopportunity to learn how to make good money decisions.  And by good I don&#39;t<br/>\nmean the decisions I would necessarily make, but decisions that are based on<br/>\ntheir own observations and experiences and that work out well for them.  And<br/>\nat a time in their lives where we (the parents) are around to share our<br/>\nexperiences and talk to them about theirs.  It gives them the opportunity to<br/>\nget to know themselves ... are they a spender, a saver, something inbetween?<br/>\nAnd the chance to try on all these different &quot;hats&quot;.  Just understanding<br/>\nthemselves around money will help them to make better decisions as they grow<br/>\nolder and get more of an independent income.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livingjoyfully.ca\">http://www.livingjoyfully.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175367753,"authorName":"yukonaurora65","from":"&quot;yukonaurora65&quot; &lt;nadineb@...&gt;","profile":"yukonaurora65","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: money & kids","postDate":"1094239313","msgId":99025,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNoYWc4aCttNWJkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwOTAzMTcxODQ0LjQ3NDI1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjIwNzA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":99024,"nextInTopic":99026,"prevInTime":99024,"nextInTime":99026,"topicId":99024,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... is what I can afford out of our budget.
