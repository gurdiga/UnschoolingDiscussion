The <br/>\narticle is called &quot;Whats that supposed to mean?&quot; It pretty much said that <br/>\nsometimes we take things the wrong way because in the past we were put down <br/>\nor judged by things we believe in causing an over-sensitivity to those <br/>\nissues. It dealt mainly with family, but I think it extends outward to <br/>\nanyone who has something to say about how we live/do things, especially if <br/>\nyour like me, (and most of you?), who does things SO differently than <br/>\nmainstream society. I enjoy being odd/strange/bizzare :) The things/ideas I <br/>\nbelieve in are very important to me! If people are happy with what they have <br/>\nthen I am happy for them :) Happiness and peace within our own selves!<br/>\nIndiana Tami<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You must be the change you wish to see in the world&quot;<br/>\n                                                               ~Ghandi<br/>\n<br/>\nTry out this fun site!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.neopets.com/refer.phtml?username=angel1bunny\">http://www.neopets.com/refer.phtml?username=angel1bunny</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ddzimlew@...\">ddzimlew@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] uncivil discourse<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 12 Sep 2001 05:43:05 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sandra, you said recently you&#39;re here to talk about unschooling, not<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; socialize. Nevertheless, if you wish not just to talk, but to be<br/>\n&gt;heard,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;ll need to resort to a few social skills.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Annette<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bridget is free to speak frankly here and has done so.  As have many<br/>\n&gt;others.  Sandra should not be the exception.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sandra, I realize you don&#39;t need anyones approval but I enjoy your input.<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;ll expect an ass kicking when I have it coming. &lt;g&gt; ( could be any<br/>\n&gt;minute now )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I am wondering if we&#39;re not all overly sensitive to some comments<br/>\n&gt;because we&#39;ve already been picked at so much by so many for our<br/>\n&gt;educational choices.  Maybe educational choice equals parenting and then<br/>\n&gt;it feels like a personal attack?<br/>\n&gt;But if we&#39;re only looking for total agreement in our ponderings most of<br/>\n&gt;us could  just talk with our partners.  Support is wonderful but<br/>\n&gt;shouldn&#39;t it be support for good stuff?<br/>\n&gt;Anyone here has a right to spank or use time out or whatever, but should<br/>\n&gt;those opposed have to say,  &quot; It&#39;s ok dear, we know you&#39;re doing what you<br/>\n&gt;feel is best.&quot; ?<br/>\n&gt;( look ma, no Satan )    No judgment intended here, I&#39;m just asking.  Do<br/>\n&gt;we come here just to be coddled or are we hoping to learn something about<br/>\n&gt;ourselves and the truth and therefore, unschooling.  My son has<br/>\n&gt;everything to lose if I can&#39;t get it right.<br/>\n&gt;Deb L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25419,"nextTopicId":25436}}
