Now what?&quot; and smiling  <br/>\naround at their &quot;new friends.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscussing unschooling is a mutual thing, but unschooling is between  <br/>\nthe parents and the children.  The discussions are intended to help  <br/>\npeople figure out how to unschool, at home when nobody&#39;s looking.  And  <br/>\nin with that, they should be figuring out on their own whether having  <br/>\ntheir kid in a tree is a good idea.  And there can&#39;t be one rule for  <br/>\nall trees at all times.  It should depend on the child&#39;s ability, the  <br/>\nownership and location of the tree, what he&#39;s wearing, what kind of  <br/>\ntree it is, whether you need to be somewhere soon, whether it would be  <br/>\na bad idea because younger, more impetuous kids are watching and might  <br/>\nfollow and be hurt, or stuck up there.  For me, at 5&#39;4&quot; and sometimes  <br/>\npregnant, when my boys were first tree-climbing, sometimes I wanted  <br/>\nthem to wait until their dad or some other taller, stronger ally was  <br/>\nthere to help them down if they needed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI climbed a spruce tree once in a Brownie uniform.  It was all fine on  <br/>\nthe way up, but on the way down, the skirt was catching on all those  <br/>\nup-pointing twigs so it took a long time to get down and I had a  <br/>\ngrowing audience of people advising me, and looking at my panties.   <br/>\nThat adds to my checklist of what to consider when a kid asks me  <br/>\nwhether I mind him climbing a tree.  Rescuing a cat is more noble than  <br/>\ngoing up there to throw sycamore balls at pedestrians.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the discussions around unschooling are good for helping people  <br/>\nfigure out how they will live by principles.

Once upon a time a vegetarian, self-proclaimed vegan no less, offer<br/>\nme corn soup with pork in it.  It was at a Native POW WOW and she didn&#39;t<br/>\nseem to see why when I choose to to stop eating meat it was universal--in<br/>\nthis case she felt she could make acceptations as Natives are an &quot;oppressed<br/>\ngroup&quot; or some vague reasons that to me seemed unconnected to her choice to<br/>\ncall herself vegan. I assumed she never ate meat because she introduced<br/>\nherself as a vegan and that is what that means. We had discussed why I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t a vegan--I eventually got the B12 deficiency that vegans are famous<br/>\nfor getting, unless they take supplements.  I researched the heck out of<br/>\nit--looked at cultures with no dairy, but fish, and The Farm where they take<br/>\nsupplements.  The Pork Eating Vegan offered herself as proof one could be a<br/>\nvegan without this B12 thing and since she self-identified I took her at<br/>\nface value.  When I saw her eat meat I realized what I&#39;d read applied, as<br/>\nyou only need eat meat a few times a year to avoid the deficiency.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts the same thing with me feeling exasperated when someone identifies me as<br/>\nan unschooler, specifically offering to bond on this mutual journey, but<br/>\nthen seems to be undermining it.

In the end it became an unschooling<br/>\nassociation because otherwise how would people find us?  I started tUNa by<br/>\naccident playing with yahoo and within an hour I had a new member--who had<br/>\nobviously searched *local unschooling group* and then joined!  I created<br/>\nFOIL and disbanded it--obviously nobody did a search on fun learning!<br/>\nLabels are a shorthand--but a way to pigeonhole people, too.  I am forever<br/>\ndrawing ire from conservatives and liberals alike--being accused of being<br/>\nsome sort of communist by conservatives and a Fascist by liberals.

Life and death<br/>\nor serious accident curtails freedom--but the unschoolers who say they are<br/>\ntaking a break from life learning by forcing their child to learn to read at<br/>\nage seven or some arbitrary age are confusing the heck out of me.
