An take it for what it&#39;s worth but <br/>\nit seems like you are putting too much effort in having the girls learn <br/>\n&quot;naturally.&quot; I mean all this changing bottles and stuff. The girls &quot;will&quot; do <br/>\nit on their own whether you lable bottles or not. Are you going to stick <br/>\npieces of paper on all the furniture labeling it too? I know people who do <br/>\nthat. The kids will get it on their own when they are ready to get it. There <br/>\nare labels and signs everywhere, you&#39;ll find them doing it on their own when <br/>\nthe time comes for each one of them. My son reads everything now becuas he&#39;s <br/>\nreally into reading. My daughter does some but not like him. In the house, <br/>\nwhen we eat when we drive, it&#39;s endless. Sometimes I have no idea what he&#39;s <br/>\ntalking about because I&#39;m busy cooking or watching the road. Point is, I <br/>\nnever labeled anything or closed captioned anything or did flash cards or <br/>\nanything even near that.

I didn&#39;t use any <br/>\nworkbooks seatwork or anything like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst my husband took the girls grocery shopping, and let them pay <br/>\nthe cashier.  Then he took them to the bank, and let them talk to <br/>\nsome of the tellers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen they came home and watched Lord Of the Rings cartoon with the <br/>\nclosed captioning on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen they helped cook dinner, and helped read from the cookbook.  <br/>\nThey also made eggrolls from scratch, that we fried.  (They LOVED <br/>\nthat)<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter we ate, the had a bath and played with several different kinds <br/>\nof soaps.  Then me and Mirial read from the butterfly book.  Mariah <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to read anything today, so after all the children went<br/>\n to bed she asked if she could have a satin hands treatment.  Satin <br/>\nHands is a product I sell that includes 4 steps, cream, buff, cleanse <br/>\nthen lotion.  So I told her I&#39;d give her a treatment if she would <br/>\ngive me one.  When it came her turn, she asked which tube was first, <br/>\nI told her the emollient cream.  It took her about 5 minutes to <br/>\nfigure out which one was the right one, then we went to the buffing <br/>\ncream, then the cleansing gel and last the lotion.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe read every one of the lotion bottles, and didn&#39;t even realize <br/>\nthat she was learning...lol That may not be a big deal to some, but <br/>\nshe actually read some, no matter how minor, and that&#39;s a HUGE deal <br/>\nto me.  I gave her a traveler size set and told her she could now do <br/>\nher own hands every day, and if she had any problems remembering <br/>\nwhich was which, to ask me.  So she may learn buffing before she does <br/>\nbird, but hey a word is a word to me...lol<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t get to make the birdhouses, it rained most of the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think we covered evey required topic today.  Science was the <br/>\nsoaps and butterflies.  Math was the cooking (they had to measure the <br/>\nspoons of filling for each eggroll) and paying for the groceries.  <br/>\nSocial Studies was at the bank, the teller was nice and explained a <br/>\nbit about her job to them, so they learned a bit about economics (no<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t plan that, but happy go lucky Mirial asked her about what <br/>\nshe was doing behind the counter and they both started asking <br/>\nquestions) and the reading was the movie and book and lotions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the time, I&#39;m going to give them both some money tomorrow to <br/>\nbuy them a cheap watch each, and I&#39;m also going to buy a larger clock <br/>\nwith hands.  Next week we&#39;ll schedule some things to do based on time <br/>\nof day, and let them &quot;Remind&quot; me when it&#39;s time to go. I think they <br/>\nwill love that MUCH better than worksheets. Say we have to leave her <br/>\nat 2:45 every day to go to the park for 30 minutes.  I&#39;m also going <br/>\nto start letting them earn a dime here, and a quarter there for <br/>\nvarious tasks they may do around the house (like help keep an eye on <br/>\nbaby sister while I cook, or like helping me fold the towels) so they <br/>\ncan start saving more than just their allowance.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime and money and measuring are the only things that concern me <br/>\nabout the math.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI see tons of ways for them to learn about science and social studies <br/>\nand math now that I am sitting back and watchign just what we are <br/>\ndoing that they can learn from. Still tryign to find other ways to <br/>\nthrow reading in, but it&#39;s a good start with bug books and the satin <br/>\nhands.
