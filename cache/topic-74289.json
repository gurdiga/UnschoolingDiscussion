Aren&#39;t we all <br/>\nbetter for it when we see other points of view?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway,  I guess I find your example a little unfathomable, even in fun. <br/>\nPerhaps I&#39;m just extra knee-jerky today. But wouldn&#39;t the Pope be the party to do <br/>\nintroductions, being the Vatican is his home, and unless Holly already knew <br/>\nthe Pope, shouldn&#39;t he introduce himself to both Holly and Gudrun? In which case <br/>\nif Holly and the Pope were acquaintances, shouldn&#39;t Holly introduce the dog <br/>\nto the Pope? Maybe it&#39;s the idea of &quot;rank&quot; that also bothers me, in real life <br/>\nas opposed to play. <br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago when I still worked, I used to talk to both our company CEO and CIO <br/>\nall the time in a personable manner and even joked around with them on <br/>\noccasion. Once my immediate manager, upon hearing me tease the CIO about his running <br/>\nability in the company softball game, had a conniption fit as soon as he <br/>\nwalked out. Mind you, I was not offensive and he in fact laughed at my remarks and <br/>\nannounced to the department that a conversation with Rhonda Hill was always a <br/>\npleasure. You see, my twins were a year younger than his twins and we bonded <br/>\nover the whole multiple birth thing early in my career, during my pregnancy in <br/>\nfact. However this manager knew nothing of our friendship, but thought she <br/>\nshould reprimand my inability to see rank. She was a lovely lady, by the name of <br/>\nElaine, and when she told me I should never speak to our CIO in such a <br/>\nmanner, I couldn&#39;t help but give her a hug. She was shaking. I asked what on earth <br/>\nbothered her so much about our conversation and she said the fact that I teased <br/>\nhim and she never would have expected me to be rude to the likes of our CIO. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy response was something to the effect, &quot;Elaine, he (CIO) makes more $ than <br/>\nme, but he is no more human than I am or you are for that matter. I have known <br/>\nhim for years, but even if I met him last month, I&#39;d still speak my mind for <br/>\nif I get hit by a Mack truck, and he gets hit by a Mack truck, we&#39;re both <br/>\ngonna be squashed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLittle did any of us know that he had come back to ask her for some stats and <br/>\nheard the whole conversation. So when I ended with the word &quot;squashed&quot; he <br/>\nroared with laughter and said he wished more people in our company would think of <br/>\nhim as a real person. Elaine looked like she was gonna puke. When he left, I <br/>\nhugged her again and told her not to worry so much. A year later the CIO left <br/>\nthe company to be the CEO of one of our biggest competitors. Guess who he came <br/>\nto say goodbye to on his last day? In a department of 80 people, he came to <br/>\nsay goodbye to me. A person of no company rank, but a fellow human who treated <br/>\nhim as such. He also said if I should ever decide to leave, to make sure I <br/>\nlooked him up and he&#39;d make me a job if he had too. <br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so I went off on an &quot;all about me&quot; tangent again, sorry. But is this rank <br/>\nthing an everyday issue or more to do with SCA, where I would fully imagine <br/>\nit to be of importance?<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda - ranking &quot;all about me&quot; poster.
