I get the impression that she thinks her year of unschooling was just to <br/>\nget her away from the old and to go back with a new attitude.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell a current story of one of my sister&#39;s kids (from the article) who <br/>\nwas five or six when that was written and is fifteen now.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua, the youngest of my sister&#39;s three, wanted to go back to school to <br/>\nplay basketball.    Now he just goes to hang out with his friends.  He is <br/>\nTOTALLY using school as socialization, and not doing well gradewise.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut two weeks ago he was suspended for wearing a stocking cap he wasn&#39;t <br/>\nsupposed to be wearing.   So my brother-in-law had to go back in with him to <br/>\nget him reinstated.  But my brother-in-law, who was a gifted honors student <br/>\neagle scout kind of guy in the same school system years ago doesn&#39;t care <br/>\nabout that hat rule, and would rather his son be home anyway.  He didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto go to meet with the principal but Joshua really wanted to go back to <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy recommendation to Gene, the dad, was to go with him this time, but tell <br/>\nJoshua that the next time Gene&#39;s just going to let the suspension ride.  That <br/>\nif Josh really wants to go to school and his parents would rather he be home, <br/>\nthen it&#39;s HIS responsibility to do what the school wants him to do to stay <br/>\nthere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe same token the parents play saying &quot;I&#39;m not going to make you do <br/>\nhomework; I&#39;m not going to punish failure or reward honor roll stuff&quot; should <br/>\nextend to &quot;If you get in trouble, YOU got in trouble.  Next time you get in <br/>\ntrouble, why don&#39;t you just come back home and homeschool?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s my added piece of advice for such situations, then.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe oldest of that family, Gina, is 18 now.  She has an extensive website.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s linked (and a piece of art is there that she did) here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/games/page\">http://sandradodd.com/games/page</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/games/page&quot;\">http://sandradodd.com/games/page&quot;</a>&gt;Benefits of Video Games&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nand the mid-kid, Elijah, is almost 17 and lately dropped out of high school <br/>\nand is going to do some community college stuff in fall, he says.  I asked <br/>\nwhy he didn&#39;t just say &quot;homeschooling&quot; instead of &quot;dropping out&quot; and he said <br/>\nthe school said he would have to sign up for accredited courses at his age.  <br/>\nI said they were wrong, but he just kinda was enjoying the notoriety of being <br/>\n&quot;a drop-out.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister just lately has decided Elijah was always on the autistic end of <br/>\nlife, probably Asperger&#39;s.  I think she&#39;s right.  They tested him for <br/>\ndeafness when he was little, and he was always in the gifted class, but often <br/>\nhad irritated all the other kids by being socially reckless and clueless.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the kids I&#39;ve known who went back seemed to have a good time, and <br/>\nenjoyed all the notebook organizational stuff.  I think if they&#39;ve never been <br/>\nto school some explanation of school supplies would  help.  Maybe find a <br/>\nfriend who&#39;s going to school and find out what&#39;s standard and &quot;cool&quot; as to <br/>\nbackpack, binder, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117187741,"authorName":"unolist@aol.com","from":"unolist@...","profile":"unolist","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Preparing the unschooler for school","postDate":"1046983040","msgId":60257,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4NC4xODIyM2MxYi4yYjk5MGI4MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":60262,"prevInTime":60256,"nextInTime":60258,"topicId":60257,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 10yo daughter is insistent on going to 6th grade middle school next year.

Now <br/>\nI find it as nothing short of brilliant. I guess that shows how far I&#39;m <br/>\ncoming with unschooling. I am prepared not to engage with the school against <br/>\nmy daughter, if she conducts herself the way she did in K-4th. I am prepared <br/>\nnot to put any stock in grades and such. I need advice on how to prepare her. <br/>\nIn my heart I think honesty is the best policy. I want her to know that I <br/>\nthink grades are a scam, and test scores are not a true representation of her <br/>\nability to learn or how bright she is. I want her to know that I was wrong to <br/>\nbattle with her in previous school years, that I only knew what I learned by <br/>\nbeing part of the same school system that no one questioned. I want her to <br/>\nknow that there is a difference between wanting school and needing school. I <br/>\nwant her to know that I don&#39;t think she needs to go to school and needs to <br/>\nget good grades and needs to get teacher approval to have some kind of <br/>\neducational self-worth. I want her to know that my own experience as an honor <br/>\nroll student was such an illusion, who was I when I stopped getting good <br/>\ngrades and playing the game? I want her to know that I think it is a game, <br/>\nand not necessarily a beneficial one. Above all, I want her to know that I <br/>\ntrust her and she can trust herself in finding who she wants to be and how to <br/>\naccomplish it. Do I need to do anything to share this with her, or just let <br/>\ngo? I get the impression that she thinks her year of unschooling was just to <br/>\nget her away from the old and to go back with a new attitude. She wants to <br/>\ntry again, as if she failed and can prove she can do it. I know now she <br/>\nwasn&#39;t failing, the system was failing her. She says she knows how to defeat <br/>\nthe popularity contest and bully crap she used to put up with. She says I <br/>\ntaught her that-- I swear I didn&#39;t! I think she idealizes school by watching <br/>\ncertain tv programs. I used to idealize middle school too. At least she has a <br/>\nchoice, isn&#39;t that half the battle?  Is it my place to show her my negative <br/>\nbias against schools? I just want her to know that no matter what happens, <br/>\nschool is just school. Good or bad, right or wrong. It&#39;s not all it&#39;s cracked <br/>\nup to be, not all what they want you to think it is.  Where I am going with <br/>\nthis, I am uncertain. The uncertainties of letting my child go back to school <br/>\nafter coming to my senses and getting her out of there after 4.5 years is so <br/>\ndifficult. How do you cope? Has anyone actually gone through this? Is there <br/>\nanything I should or shouldn&#39;t be doing in all of this?
