Now she <br/>\nwants to begin breeding them and has been doing research for months now.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;We bought a 20gallon long tank because we have 3 cats, and we were <br/>\nconcerned they would be able to get a claw through a cage.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have two cat and both are afraid of the rats.  It&#39;s hysterical to watch, <br/>\none of the cats comes to investigate while on of our girls is out with us.  <br/>\nThe rats sees the cat and CHARGES it, mouth wide open showing her teeth and <br/>\nthe cat RUNS away.  Our ratties will even hiss and jump at the cats when they <br/>\ndare to come near their cage.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour cage is good but I recommend getting something bigger when you can, or <br/>\nmake an extension to the one you fave.  There are a LOT of web pages about <br/>\npet rats and many of the owners have a page dedicated to their cages.  You <br/>\ncan find a lot of examples of home made cages and some of them start with a <br/>\nlarge aquarium at the bottom.  We managed to snag a great deal on a ferret <br/>\ncage for half price but we want to make one of our own too.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Anyway, I did the unthinkable. (And, yes, I<br/>\nknow, I&#39;m an idiot.) While buying some supplies in the local shop in<br/>\npreparation for our future rat, I let the moronic sales guy show us the nice<br/>\nfeeder rat they had. I know, I know, just shoot me.

A LOT of the dedicated rat lovers <br/>\nrescue feeders like this.  Temperament is the main concern in these cases and <br/>\nit sounds like your guy is real sweet.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;His health is obviously questionable. He looks OK, no discharge, no lumps, <br/>\nnice body, but occasional sneezes. Doesn&#39;t sound wheezy.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRats and respiratory problems just seem to go hand in hand.  In fact, <br/>\nvirtually all pet rats are born with one particular rd, I can&#39;t recall the <br/>\nname right now but almost all the good web sites have a section on it.  Their <br/>\nenvironment and care make a big difference on how long it takes for the <br/>\nsymptoms to appear and worsen.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour rat may just be still dealing with the care he got in the store.  If he <br/>\nwas on pine bedding his respiratory tract may be irritated and he&#39;ll probably <br/>\nget better soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;So far he is really only eating the crappy kibble mixture that was <br/>\navailable in the pet store.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI recommend giving them a good lab block and providing the variety with fresh <br/>\nfood.  Our girls get a portion of what we have everyday (the stuff thats good <br/>\nfor them that is).  We buy mostly organic produce and when we eat we think of <br/>\nthem, we give them our apple cores, carrot greens, etc.  The kids also find <br/>\nbugs for them outside, they LOVE bugs, especially grasshoppers.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Another issue is<br/>\ngetting him a playmate. My plan was to buy two siblings.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe younger the better.  If they&#39;re both still babies they should do fine.  <br/>\nPerhaps you can find another &quot;rescue&quot;?  If you go to the pet store the best <br/>\nplan is to look for &quot;volunteers&quot;, little rats that will willingly come up to <br/>\nyour hand.  They grow fast so I would recommend finding a buddy for him right <br/>\naway.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Do I go back to the pet store and see if he had a &quot;nice&quot; sibling?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I would do in your situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;More importantly,<br/>\nsince he&#39;s been inside my shirt and bathrobe for two hours, does rat pee<br/>\nwash out?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yes!  The more your rattie loves you the more he&#39;ll &quot;mark&quot; you.  He&#39;s <br/>\nletting all the other ratties (he doesn&#39;t know there aren&#39;t any others) know <br/>\nthat you are HIS human.  Sometimes our little girls will leave tiny bits all <br/>\nover us, we are wet but honored.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I&#39;m sorry to be so &quot;needy&quot;, but I have had such a difficult time finding<br/>\nanyone else who has a pet rat.

My name is Lisa, I live in Brooklyn, my son<br/>\nis turning 8 this month (always unschooled), and I just joined the list<br/>\ntoday. The rat message is timely, because we just brought one home two days<br/>\nago. I need some advice, if you can spare the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started thinking about getting a rat last year. I was unable to find any<br/>\nbreeders in NYC, so we put the idea on the shelf until recently. My son<br/>\nsaved his money, and we started gathering supplies for a rat. We bought a 20<br/>\ngallon long tank because we have 3 cats, and we were concerned they would be<br/>\nable to get a claw through a cage. (I know it will need more frequent<br/>\ncleanings to keep down the ammonia.) We got recycled paper bedding, which I<br/>\nreally like, (very clean, no odor), a bowl, and water bottle. We found a man<br/>\nwho could &quot;special order&quot; a rat from a breeder. I had very mixed feelings<br/>\nabout this. I still didn&#39;t know who the breeder was, or how they shipped the<br/>\nanimal, etc. And I wasn&#39;t crazy about &quot;ordering&quot; an animal sight unseen. I<br/>\nposted to our local homeschool group to see if anyone else had any rats, or<br/>\nbreeder recommendations. Zip, zero. (It is even difficult to find rat food<br/>\nin NYC; how weird is that?) Anyway, I did the unthinkable. (And, yes, I<br/>\nknow, I&#39;m an idiot.) While buying some supplies in the local shop in<br/>\npreparation for our future rat, I let the moronic sales guy show us the nice<br/>\nfeeder rat they had. I know, I know, just shoot me. Well, obviously, after<br/>\nwe saw the poor little thing, terrified out of his mind, peeing everywhere,<br/>\nhow could we leave him? My son looked at me with those big, sappy brown eyes<br/>\nand said, &quot;Can we keep him? I&#39;ll name him Frodo.&quot; My mind was saying, &quot;You<br/>\nhave got to be kidding&quot;, but my heart was breaking. He had a name; how could<br/>\nI let him be eaten? Fool that I am, we brought poor Frodo home. My son is<br/>\nover-the-moon on love. He is a very sweet rat, very lovey. I&#39;m not sure how<br/>\nold he is, but a fairly educated guess is 4 to 6 months. His health is<br/>\nobviously questionable. He looks OK, no discharge, no lumps, nice body, but<br/>\noccasional sneezes. Doesn&#39;t sound wheezy. So far he is really only eating<br/>\nthe crappy kibble mixture that was available in the pet store. (We are going<br/>\ninto the city Friday to look for something of better quality.) He has had a<br/>\ntiny bit of apple (yesterday), and today a tiny bit of tangerine. Today he<br/>\nhad very soft poop, almost diarrhea. I&#39;m assuming from the tangerine. He has<br/>\nobviously never had treats, and we are being very cautious. I would like to<br/>\nimprove his diet, and I am concerned about his sneezing. Another issue is<br/>\ngetting him a playmate. My plan was to buy two siblings. Great plan, right.<br/>\nI had NO intention of buying a feeder. So now what do I do? Do I try to get<br/>\na companion animal from a breeder? Do I go back to the pet store and see if<br/>\nhe had a &quot;nice&quot; sibling? Do I wait and see how his health is? If I wait too<br/>\nlong, will it be more difficult to introduce a new pet? More importantly,<br/>\nsince he&#39;s been inside my shirt and bathrobe for two hours, does rat pee<br/>\nwash out? (I don&#39;t feel any wet yet, but he&#39;s certainly peed on me before.)<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry to be so &quot;needy&quot;, but I have had such a difficult time finding<br/>\nanyone else who has a pet rat.
