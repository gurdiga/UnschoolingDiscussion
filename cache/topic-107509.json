If the mom had said &quot;Ask if Holly can come over tomorrow to swim <br/>\nin the afternoon and we can pick her up,&quot; that would&#39;ve been fine.    But it <br/>\nwas &quot;Holly, do you want to come over tomorrow?&quot;   And that inviter had not a <br/>\nsingle answer to what time or how or how long or what are we going to do.   Two <br/>\ndifferent families.   The mom might&#39;ve thought she was &quot;teaching&quot; the child <br/>\nto use the phone or to make her own arrangements, but the result was that we <br/>\nwere frustrated and that child was not experiencing confidence or <br/>\naccomplishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe in such a family the child will go no further in planning than to say <br/>\n&quot;Do you want to go to the mall?&quot;    And then the rest of the trip to the mall <br/>\nmight unfold roughly (like they don&#39;t get there in time for a movie, or have to <br/>\nbe back before it would end, or whatever).   And maybe those parents know <br/>\ntheir child is incapable of planning something smoothly, but it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nbecause of age, it would more likely be because the child wasn&#39;t used to having <br/>\nsomeone more experienced ask the right questions for years before they were 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny of my kids have been able to for years plan an outing, with times and <br/>\ntravel times and how much money they&#39;ll need, but maybe it&#39;s partly modelling and <br/>\nmaybe it&#39;s partly coaching and SURELY it&#39;s partly genetics.   Keith and I <br/>\nwere first drawn to each other because of singing and organizational ability, and <br/>\nwe have singing, organizing kids.   <br/>\n<br/>\nKeith&#39;s first serious interest in me came from my having organized a bus trip <br/>\nfor 25 people to Houston.   Not a charter trip; that&#39;s easy.   A schoolbus, <br/>\nbought, repainted, equipped, and the route planned (there&#39;s not an easy route <br/>\nfrom Albuquerque to Houston) food on the way (some meals from coolers and one <br/>\nstop a day at an all-you-can eat place)...   He rode back with us, but had <br/>\nflown out. I was 24 years old.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI was 24, so does that mean 24 year olds can organize group outings?   <br/>\nHolly is 13 and can organize outings, but does that mean 13 year olds CAN <br/>\norganize outings?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about age.   Rules about ages will always miss.   I was not allowed <br/>\nto date until I was 15.   Some 15 year olds have already sneaked off and done <br/>\ntheir worst under unsanitary conditions.   Some are not ready to date at 15.   <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRules over principles are bad because they don&#39;t allow people to develop at <br/>\ntheir own rate and for things to be done for reasons of desire and readiness <br/>\nand maturity.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrinciples over rules, though, when the people in the situations don&#39;t have <br/>\nor understand principles, results in a mess of nothing useful.   And so while <br/>\nit&#39;s ideal for people to live by principles, maybe in some families the <br/>\nprinciple is that all that works for them are rules and ages because they don&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand any   other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis rolls back onto the question of whether anyone can unschool.   <br/>\nI don&#39;t suppose they can, if they don&#39;t have the ability to stop and wonder <br/>\nwhat it would be, and see several ways in which they might contribute <br/>\npositively to it right then, and to also see what the roadblocks are in their own lives <br/>\nand to have some idea how to disassemble those or avoid them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about being a certain age, it&#39;s something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107475,"nextTopicId":107398}}
