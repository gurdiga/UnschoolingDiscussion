The newer issue is out, so the old one&#39;s <br/>\nmine again.  That March article was called &quot;The School in my Head.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe School in my Head<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Nobody&#39;s perfect,&quot; they say, and I have been challenged to reveal my own <br/>\ndoubts and failings.  I don&#39;t mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have a school in my head.  Witness my total unwillingness to go to <br/>\nDisney World.  That is a definite &quot;nope&quot; for me, and the only thing that would <br/>\nhelp would be more deschooling.  That might happen, but I would rather settle <br/>\nfor the more comfortable Disneyland.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the true and embarrassing reason that I can love Disneyland and fear <br/>\nDisney World:  I can score a higher percentage at Disneyland.  I can do better <br/>\nthan 80%, maybe 90% if I stay three days.    I have heard from many people <br/>\nthat one would have to stay at Disney World a week to see it all.  So I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to go, because if I see any less than 70% that would not be a passing <br/>\ngrade. <br/>\n<br/>\nI see the world in terms of percentage grades.  I have a &quot;grading&quot; overlay <br/>\nbehind my eyes somehow that still hasn&#39;t totally faded out.  It&#39;s sad but true.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some people it&#39;s even worse, though.  Some people can&#39;t leave school <br/>\nbecause they&#39;re carrying it around like a snail and his shell.  They live there, <br/>\nstill.  School became an ingrown, hard part of them.   They still define <br/>\nthemselves by their school failures and successes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does a person who has gone to school for twelve years or thirteen or <br/>\nsixteen or twenty years get over all that programming and all those messages?  <br/>\nSlowly, and with effort, and sometimes school can still flood back in or ooze <br/>\naround the edges.  Can they find their school-less selves?<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year I forgot school was out, and offered to help a friend of mine in <br/>\none of her history classes.  It was July, though, and she said, &quot;Cool!  When <br/>\nschool starts.&quot;   She needed to borrow some chain mail, but not in summer.    <br/>\nThat seemed like progress, for me to have been unaware of &quot;school year&quot; for a <br/>\nwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery September, &quot;back to school&quot; kicks in.  I crave the smell of crayons and <br/>\nnew pencils.   I like to go down the school supply aisle at the store and <br/>\nadmire packages of paper, and new binders.  My kids still have the binders <br/>\nthey&#39;ve had for years and they don&#39;t need new ones.  I don&#39;t either, yet I&#39;m drawn <br/>\nthere like a migratory bird that has to pass over familiar ground at the same <br/>\ntime every year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the appearance of the letter &quot;A&quot; much better than I like to see a &quot;D&quot; <br/>\nor an &quot;F.&quot;  My maiden name started with &quot;A&quot;, and my married name starts with <br/>\n&quot;D.&quot;   &quot;D&quot; is not as good.  Those letters are branded into my brain with their <br/>\n&quot;values&quot; from school.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut little scars like that are only irritations or curiosities.  I regret <br/>\nscars and imperfections and little sorrows, but though they slow me down, they <br/>\ndon&#39;t cripple me.  I can see through and over them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is part of me, and I am part of the school memories of many people, <br/>\nwhether as a schoolmate or as their teacher.    But school is not a part of my <br/>\nchildren, nor they of school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people say to me, &quot;You&#39;re patient with your own children but pushy <br/>\nwith unschooling parents.&quot;   I don&#39;t go door to door asking people if they <br/>\nknow about unschooling, and whether they&#39;d like to know more.   If they come <br/>\nwhere I already am, though, I might press.  And when I do, it&#39;s because of the <br/>\npossibility that they will run out of time. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have their whole lives to memorize 7x8 if they want to.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mother of a twelve year old has VERY little time if she wants to help her <br/>\nchild recover from school and spend a few unschooling years with him before <br/>\nhe&#39;s grown and gone. She doesn&#39;t have time to ease into it gradually.  If she <br/>\nstalls, he&#39;ll be fifteen or sixteen and it just won&#39;t happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the mother of a five year old is trying to decide how much reading <br/>\ninstruction and math drill to continue with before she switches to unschooling, I <br/>\nwould rather press her to decide toward &quot;none,&quot; because &quot;some&quot; is damaging to the <br/>\nchild&#39;s potential to learn it joyfully and discover it on his own. And &quot;lots&quot; <br/>\nwill only hurt that much more. &quot;None&quot; can still be turned to &quot;some&quot; if the <br/>\nparent can&#39;t get unschooling.  But if she doesn&#39;t even try unschooling, she <br/>\nmisses forever the opportunity to see that child learn to read gradually and <br/>\nnaturally.  It will be gone forever. <br/>\nForever. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I don&#39;t say, &quot;Gosh, I&#39;m sure whatever you&#39;re <br/>\ndoing is fine, and if you want to unschool you can <br/>\ncome to it gradually at your own pace.  No hurry.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople say jokingly (though it&#39;s true) of their late-reading children, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nsure he&#39;ll be reading by the time he goes on a date.&quot;  The same cannot be said <br/>\nof unschooling, though, if the parent is attached to thinking she needs to <br/>\nteach things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUntil a person stops doing the things that keep unschooling from working, <br/>\nunschooling cannot begin to work. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems simple to me.  If you&#39;re trying to listen for a sound, you have to <br/>\nstop talking and be still. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people want to see unschooling while they&#39;re still teaching and putzing <br/>\nand assigning and requiring. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey have to stop that first. And then they have to be still. And then they <br/>\nhave to look at their children with new eyes. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they don&#39;t, it won&#39;t happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nI still see &quot;subject areas&quot; everywhere, but I haven&#39;t taught those categories <br/>\nand prejudices to my children.   Science has much more to do with history <br/>\nthan geology has to do with microbiology, but in school geology, biology, <br/>\nastronomy and physics are all &quot;the same thing,&quot; and history is different altogether.  <br/>\nYet the best parts of history involve the knowledge cultures had and how <br/>\nthey put it to use, whether in shipbuilding or iron tool use, medicine or <br/>\ncommunications.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly asked yesterday about when people discovered the world wasn&#39;t flat.  I <br/>\ntold her there was no one date or century because people discovered different <br/>\nthings at different times, and some were shushed up when they said the world <br/>\nwas round, or that the sun didn&#39;t orbit around the earth.   I also told her, <br/>\n&quot;Ask your dad, because he&#39;s really interested in the history of science.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed when I said it that I had &quot;named subject areas,&quot; but I didn&#39;t feel <br/>\ntoo bad.  She&#39;s twelve, and reading, and after all &quot;the history of science&quot; <br/>\nwas never part of my schooling.  A science teacher wasn&#39;t certified to teach me <br/>\nhistory, and vice versa.  Only outside of school did I figure out that <br/>\nscientific discoveries were history, and that music was science, and that art was <br/>\nhistory.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool served to prevent connections for me, but I overcame that, with <br/>\ndifficulty.  It is a problem my children never had.  If Animaniacs completed a <br/>\ncircuit for them between Magellan and WWII, well it&#39;s a circuit school would never <br/>\nhave completed for me under any circumstances.  If learning for fun creates <br/>\nmore connections than &quot;serious learning&quot; did, I can no longer look at &quot;serious <br/>\nlearning&quot; seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best function of the school in my head, as it turns out, is to remind me <br/>\nwhere not to dwell.  I did my time in and around school, and learned things <br/>\npainstakingly and grudgingly that my children later learned while laughing and <br/>\nplaying and singing.  I have guarded my children&#39;s freedom and given them happy <br/>\nchoices that I didn&#39;t have.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI know from school that the best way to end an essay is to tie it back to the <br/>\nbeginning, but these birds cannot nest where I started.  They are a <br/>\ngeneration removed and have flown freely out and about without a school to return to in <br/>\nSeptember.   But wait:  if I take 10% off the essay for a weak ending, I do <br/>\nindeed tie it back, and so might yet get an &quot;A.&quot;    <br/>\n<br/>\nQuite pathetic, but it makes me feel better.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd lives in Albuquerque and has three tall young people in her <br/>\nfamily who have never been to school.

I don&#39;t mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have a school in my head.  Witness my total unwillingness to go to <br/>\nDisney World.  That is a definite &quot;nope&quot; for me, and the only thing that would <br/>\nhelp would be more deschooling.  That might happen, but I would rather settle <br/>\nfor the more comfortable Disneyland.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the true and embarrassing reason that I can love Disneyland and fear <br/>\nDisney World:  I can score a higher percentage at Disneyland.  I can do better <br/>\nthan 80%, maybe 90% if I stay three days.    I have heard from many people <br/>\nthat one would have to stay at Disney World a week to see it all.  So I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to go, because if I see any less than 70% that would not be a passing <br/>\ngrade. <br/>\n<br/>\nI see the world in terms of percentage grades.  I have a &quot;grading&quot; overlay <br/>\nbehind my eyes somehow that still hasn&#39;t totally faded out.  It&#39;s sad but true.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some people it&#39;s even worse, though.  Some people can&#39;t leave school <br/>\nbecause they&#39;re carrying it around like a snail and his shell.  They live there, <br/>\nstill.  School became an ingrown, hard part of them.   They still define <br/>\nthemselves by their school failures and successes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does a person who has gone to school for twelve years or thirteen or <br/>\nsixteen or twenty years get over all that programming and all those messages?  <br/>\nSlowly, and with effort, and sometimes school can still flood back in or ooze <br/>\naround the edges.  Can they find their school-less selves?<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year I forgot school was out, and offered to help a friend of mine in <br/>\none of her history classes.  It was July, though, and she said, &quot;Cool!  When <br/>\nschool starts.&quot;   She needed to borrow some chain mail, but not in summer.    <br/>\nThat seemed like progress, for me to have been unaware of &quot;school year&quot; for a <br/>\nwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery September, &quot;back to school&quot; kicks in.  I crave the smell of crayons and <br/>\nnew pencils.   I like to go down the school supply aisle at the store and <br/>\nadmire packages of paper, and new binders.  My kids still have the binders <br/>\nthey&#39;ve had for years and they don&#39;t need new ones.  I don&#39;t either, yet I&#39;m drawn <br/>\nthere like a migratory bird that has to pass over familiar ground at the same <br/>\ntime every year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the appearance of the letter &quot;A&quot; much better than I like to see a &quot;D&quot; <br/>\nor an &quot;F.&quot;  My maiden name started with &quot;A&quot;, and my married name starts with <br/>\n&quot;D.&quot;   &quot;D&quot; is not as good.

I regret <br/>\nscars and imperfections and little sorrows, but though they slow me down, they <br/>\ndon&#39;t cripple me.  I can see through and over them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is part of me, and I am part of the school memories of many people, <br/>\nwhether as a schoolmate or as their teacher.    But school is not a part of my <br/>\nchildren, nor they of school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people say to me, &quot;You&#39;re patient with your own children but pushy <br/>\nwith unschooling parents.&quot;   I don&#39;t go door to door asking people if they <br/>\nknow about unschooling, and whether they&#39;d like to know more.   If they come <br/>\nwhere I already am, though, I might press.  And when I do, it&#39;s because of the <br/>\npossibility that they will run out of time. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have their whole lives to memorize 7x8 if they want to.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mother of a twelve year old has VERY little time if she wants to help her <br/>\nchild recover from school and spend a few unschooling years with him before <br/>\nhe&#39;s grown and gone. She doesn&#39;t have time to ease into it gradually.  If she <br/>\nstalls, he&#39;ll be fifteen or sixteen and it just won&#39;t happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the mother of a five year old is trying to decide how much reading <br/>\ninstruction and math drill to continue with before she switches to unschooling, I <br/>\nwould rather press her to decide toward &quot;none,&quot; because &quot;some&quot; is damaging to the <br/>\nchild&#39;s potential to learn it joyfully and discover it on his own. And &quot;lots&quot; <br/>\nwill only hurt that much more. &quot;None&quot; can still be turned to &quot;some&quot; if the <br/>\nparent can&#39;t get unschooling.  But if she doesn&#39;t even try unschooling, she <br/>\nmisses forever the opportunity to see that child learn to read gradually and <br/>\nnaturally.  It will be gone forever. <br/>\nForever. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I don&#39;t say, &quot;Gosh, I&#39;m sure whatever you&#39;re <br/>\ndoing is fine, and if you want to unschool you can <br/>\ncome to it gradually at your own pace.  No hurry.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople say jokingly (though it&#39;s true) of their late-reading children, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nsure he&#39;ll be reading by the time he goes on a date.&quot;  The same cannot be said <br/>\nof unschooling, though, if the parent is attached to thinking she needs to <br/>\nteach things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUntil a person stops doing the things that keep unschooling from working, <br/>\nunschooling cannot begin to work. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems simple to me.  If you&#39;re trying to listen for a sound, you have to <br/>\nstop talking and be still. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people want to see unschooling while they&#39;re still teaching and putzing <br/>\nand assigning and requiring. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey have to stop that first.

And then they <br/>\nhave to look at their children with new eyes. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they don&#39;t, it won&#39;t happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nI still see &quot;subject areas&quot; everywhere, but I haven&#39;t taught those categories <br/>\nand prejudices to my children.   Science has much more to do with history <br/>\nthan geology has to do with microbiology, but in school geology, biology, <br/>\nastronomy and physics are all &quot;the same thing,&quot; and history is different altogether.  <br/>\nYet the best parts of history involve the knowledge cultures had and how <br/>\nthey put it to use, whether in shipbuilding or iron tool use, medicine or <br/>\ncommunications.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly asked yesterday about when people discovered the world wasn&#39;t flat.  I <br/>\ntold her there was no one date or century because people discovered different <br/>\nthings at different times, and some were shushed up when they said the world <br/>\nwas round, or that the sun didn&#39;t orbit around the earth.   I also told her, <br/>\n&quot;Ask your dad, because he&#39;s really interested in the history of science.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed when I said it that I had &quot;named subject areas,&quot; but I didn&#39;t feel <br/>\ntoo bad.  She&#39;s twelve, and reading, and after all &quot;the history of science&quot; <br/>\nwas never part of my schooling.  A science teacher wasn&#39;t certified to teach me <br/>\nhistory, and vice versa.  Only outside of school did I figure out that <br/>\nscientific discoveries were history, and that music was science, and that art was <br/>\nhistory.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool served to prevent connections for me, but I overcame that, with <br/>\ndifficulty.  It is a problem my children never had.  If Animaniacs completed a <br/>\ncircuit for them between Magellan and WWII, well it&#39;s a circuit school would never <br/>\nhave completed for me under any circumstances.  If learning for fun creates <br/>\nmore connections than &quot;serious learning&quot; did, I can no longer look at &quot;serious <br/>\nlearning&quot; seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best function of the school in my head, as it turns out, is to remind me <br/>\nwhere not to dwell.  I did my time in and around school, and learned things <br/>\npainstakingly and grudgingly that my children later learned while laughing and <br/>\nplaying and singing.  I have guarded my children&#39;s freedom and given them happy <br/>\nchoices that I didn&#39;t have.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI know from school that the best way to end an essay is to tie it back to the <br/>\nbeginning, but these birds cannot nest where I started.  They are a <br/>\ngeneration removed and have flown freely out and about without a school to return to in <br/>\nSeptember.
