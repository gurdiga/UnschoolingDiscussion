It took my kids&#39; whole lives to get from birth to now.   So <br/>\nwhether it&#39;s &quot;okay&quot; to go to the movies with dishes in the sink is way too <br/>\nparticular a question to ask.  It&#39;s not about dishes, it&#39;s about belief and <br/>\nattitude and relationships between parents and children.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Or like today the kids made a sandwhich and hadn&#39;t put away any of the <br/>\n<br/>\ningredients.  I wanted them to come in and help put them away.  And waiting <br/>\n<br/>\nisn&#39;t a good idea because it was perishable foods.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my kids are making their own food, I&#39;m willing to clean up after it if I&#39;m <br/>\nthere, because it&#39;s easier than ME making them food (after which I&#39;d have to <br/>\nclean up after myself).<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  Like it&#39;s okay if you need to dump the clean clothes from the laundry <br/>\n<br/>\nhamper to find what you want but just put them all back in the hamper when <br/>\n<br/>\nyou are done.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDumped where?  If they&#39;re clean can&#39;t you just put them away?  If they were <br/>\nput away the kid wouldn&#39;t have to be digging for clean clothes.  If ours dump <br/>\nclean laundry to look,they dump it on the couch.  It can stay until it&#39;s <br/>\nfolded, or I put it into the laundry basket myself, because I don&#39;t want to sort and <br/>\nfold it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t want  to punish yet how do I get accross that bubble gum goes IN <br/>\nTHE <br/>\n<br/>\nTRASH CAN not on the floor??? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWould punishing help?<br/>\nWe&#39;ve always wrapped gum in paper before putting it in the trash so the gum <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t stick to the inside of the trashcan.  But my kids don&#39;t chew much gum <br/>\neither.  It&#39;s rare.  They&#39;ll throw it away in its own wrapper if they still <br/>\nhave that in their pocket, or in a piece of paper that&#39;s already in the trash, or <br/>\na piece of toilet paper.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Or they make a spill in the kitchen and rather than tell me about they <br/>\nleave it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they would just tell me I would come in and help them clean up.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I find stuff on the floor and I don&#39;t know who did it, I yell &quot;WHO SPILLED <br/>\nTHIS WATER?&quot; or something, and while I&#39;m getting stuff to clean it up, a kid <br/>\nor two will show up, and know or not know, and if it&#39;s the one who spilled it <br/>\n(or not), and I&#39;ll be saying it&#39;s dangerous, and if it&#39;s something like milk <br/>\nit&#39;s important for them to know it would STINK.  But honestly, it&#39;s been years <br/>\nand years since I found a sticky-spill.   We have a box of rags under the sink <br/>\nso it&#39;s easy for someone to get a rag.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we don&#39;t MAKE them clean up their own messes in a punitive way, <br/>\nthey&#39;re willing to help other people clean up messes they make.

She understands when she<br/>\ntakes her pull up off, it gets thrown in the garbage can. Last year she left<br/>\nthe papers all over the floor. When she was younger, she saw her brother and<br/>\nsisters throwing stuff away and although it wasn&#39;t important to her yet to<br/>\ndo so, she was watching. And she saw me pick up her stuff and throw it all<br/>\naway. Sometimes saying where it goes as I was doing it, sometimes not.

She saw the results of ants coming from food<br/>\nbeing left out. Every now and then she gets sidetracked but I always ask her<br/>\nwhat she did with her banana, cookie bar, etc. and she tells me she threw it<br/>\naway. She also, most of the time when she&#39;s done eating from a plate,<br/>\nremembers to put the plate on the counter so I can reach it from the kitchen<br/>\nto wash. They mostly eat in the playroom. Like now I found her almost eaten<br/>\nbowl of cereal on the counter. I didn&#39;t say anything to her. It&#39;s just<br/>\nsomething the kids do. And if anything is left around, I just go and put it<br/>\nwhere it needs to be.

And banana peels in the compost or trash? Mine are 5 <br/>\nand almost 8 and they are not consistant with this. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do ask my kids to do things and rarely do they want to.  Yet they will <br/>\nspontaneously do some things that do help around the house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen some of you are saying it is just plain rude for someone to drop a <br/>\nwraper on the floor and not clean it up what age child are you thinking of?  <br/>\nBecause I can see as a 5yo or 8yo thinking what is  the big deal that a <br/>\nwrapper is on the floor?  I am not troubled by it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want  to punish yet how do I get accross that bubble gum goes IN THE <br/>\nTRASH CAN not on the floor???    It has been suggested that we accept no as <br/>\nan answer.  Then it is up to us to pick up the wrapper or bubble gum on the <br/>\nfloor.  So when will they do this willingly?  So when the kids are young are <br/>\nthey being rude or are they just forgetful and unware?  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow much do we expect of our kids in relationship to housework /<br/>\nconsideration for others when they are young??<br/>\n<br/>\nI am really struggling with this right now.  Because I see so many things that <br/>\nget done that don&#39;t seem necessary to me that I would like the kids to see that <br/>\nas well.  Like it&#39;s okay if you need to dump the clean clothes from the laundry <br/>\nhamper to find what you want but just put them all back in the hamper when <br/>\nyou are done.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr last night my son just dropped his coat in the living room and the right after <br/>\nthat took out all of the yarn from the yarn/craft drawer and dropped it on the <br/>\nfloor.  I asked him to either hang up the coat or put it on his bed and put the <br/>\nyarn back in the drawer.  He refused at first but I persisted and he finally did it.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t belive I was particularly nagging...just persistent with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr like today the kids made a sandwhich and hadn&#39;t put away any of the <br/>\ningredients.  I wanted them to come in and help put them away.  And waiting <br/>\nisn&#39;t a good idea because it was perishable foods.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOr they make a spill in the kitchen and rather than tell me about they leave it.  <br/>\nIf they would just tell me I would come in and help them clean up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was another thread recently about popcorn being all over the floor with <br/>\nrubberbands and toys etc...so when you have just had enough of the mess we <br/>\nask for help and if they don&#39;t can we say yes I will help you after I am finished <br/>\nwith this?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess another question I am trying to understand is so its okay to go to the <br/>\nmovies before the kitchen is cleaned yet how do we finally say I really want to <br/>\nget this done before I do anything else?  Not the they have to help but if they <br/>\ndo help its more likely the mom will have the energy and time to do what the <br/>\nkids want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when the kids are young I find the other issue is not that they won&#39;t help <br/>\nyet they are fighting or bickering with each other then I can&#39;t even get done the <br/>\ncleaning I want to get done.  Which I have let slide so I can be available for <br/>\nthem and not focus on a clean house.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo is the answer both?? We go to the movies when the kitchen is dirty and <br/>\nsometimes we go to the movies the next day because Mom really wants to get <br/>\nthe house picked up?<br/>\n<br/>\nSamantha</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: responsibility, etc.","postDate":"1068640030","msgId":84558,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkMy4xNDQ2MmM0Mi4yY2UzODExZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":84557,"nextInTopic":84574,"prevInTime":84557,"nextInTime":84559,"topicId":84506,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/11/2003 9:54:50 PM Central Standard Time, sheran@ptd.net writes: I wouldn t ever just drop a candy wrapper on the ground and I don t ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-439417708\">In a message dated 11/11/2003 9:54:50 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheran@...\">sheran@...</a> writes:<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t ever just drop a candy wrapper on the ground and I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink my kids would either, but when you&#39;re sitting somewhere doing <br/>\nsomething--on the computer, playing a game, watching a show--it&#39;s <br/>\nVERY easy to just set it down and not  think about throwing it away <br/>\nwhen you get up.

I <br/>\ndon&#39;t see what the problem is.<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] responsibility, etc.","postDate":"1068582694","msgId":84506,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhMi4xY2E3NzgwMy4yY2UyYTEyNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":84508,"prevInTime":84505,"nextInTime":84507,"topicId":84506,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/11/2003 12:53:59 PM Eastern Standard Time, UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com writes: If you have any real suggestions, I d gladly","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2006219440\">In a message dated 11/11/2003 12:53:59 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\nIf you have any real suggestions, I&#39;d gladly listen.....but asking the kids<br/>\nto pick up after themselves once or twice a day so people can navigate the<br/>\nhouse and so I will have time to help them with activities and projects<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem like coersion to me....it seems like simple respect.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt ALL boils down to respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of a child----and ESPECIALLY an adult---that would walk by and toss <br/>\na candy wrapper on the den floor is absolutely incredible to me! <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a group of kids that comes here----who are pigs (OK, I don&#39;t need to <br/>\ncatch the same kind of crap I caught for my slug comment earlier this year!). I <br/>\nwalked up one day, and they had put tictacs in their mouths, sucked the color <br/>\noff, and then SPIT them on my floor! TWO canisters of them! I was OUTRAGED. <br/>\nSticky candy pieces all over the carpet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m certainly not the queen of clean, but there are limits. That went WAAAY <br/>\nover my comfort zone of just existing! Who would actually DARE to behave like <br/>\nthat in his own house, much less someone else&#39;s????<br/>\n<br/>\nrant, rant, rant, rant<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway. These kids are made to clean up at their own house---whether they <br/>\nwant to or not. So I figure that they see it as, since they have to clean, that <br/>\nthey can mess it up however they want----it doesn&#39;t matter. *Maybe* they&#39;ll <br/>\nluck out and mom will clean it. Maybe not, but at least *it doesn&#39;t matter*. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt matters to me. Duncan&#39;s room is not sparkling, by any means. I get in <br/>\nthere and clean it up every week or so. He helps. Sometimes he does it himself. <br/>\nBut the thing is: He OWNS It. It&#39;s not clean because I make him. It&#39;s not dirty <br/>\nbecause he doesn&#39;t care. We both care. That&#39;s a HUGE difference. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe own the messes. We own the clean. We help each other. There&#39;s no <br/>\nanimosity. There&#39;s no requirement. There&#39;s no shame. There&#39;s just respect---for <br/>\nourselves, for each other, for our home.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84732,"nextTopicId":84749}}
