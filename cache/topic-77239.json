When\nshe was","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1869665359\">Shellley,\r<br/>\n    I would like to address your concerns with having Jacob formally<br/>\nassessed for Autism Spectrum Disorder.  My daugher, Amanda is 12 1/2.  When<br/>\nshe was in third grade (began homeschooling in fourth grade) she was<br/>\nassessed for ADHD and Autism Spectrum.  She was officially diagnosed with<br/>\nADHD and Asperger&#39;s Syndrome.  At the time, being that she was in school,<br/>\nshe needed the assessment for special accommodations.  When it became<br/>\napparent that the school was not accomodating her, I brought her home. <br/>\n(homeschooling was always something I wanted to do for her but couldn&#39;t<br/>\nbeing a single mom with no support...at the end of third grade I became<br/>\ndisabled and was able to bring her home).  Now that she is being<br/>\nhomeschooled, the only benefit to an official diagnosis is that she receives<br/>\nSocial Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).  Yes, I believe unschooling is<br/>\nthe best approach for her.  She has blossomed in the freedom that she has at<br/>\nhome.  I did not work with an Early Intervention because I did my own<br/>\nreading up on both disorders.  I didn&#39;t feel like her idyoscyncracies were<br/>\ndetrimental to her.  Actually, by not addressing the Austitic stims since<br/>\nbringing her home, they have lessened.  I really don&#39;t know what to<br/>\nattribute that to.  If I was not in need of the SSDI, I would not have<br/>\nworried about the official dx in hindsight.  I use the SSDI to buy her<br/>\nlearning games/toys, books, etc.  Whatever she expresses a desire to study,<br/>\nwe find the materials and buy them with her monthly benefit.  Just by doing<br/>\nalot of reading (Tony Attwood&#39;s Asperger&#39;s Syndrome, The Out-of-Sync Child,<br/>\nand various books on Sensory Integration Disorder), I began to understand my<br/>\ndaughter and see her unique attributes as a huge part of who she is.  I<br/>\ncertainly don&#39;t need the label now that we are homeschooling.  I found,<br/>\nthrough trial and error, that unschooling is what works best for Amanda. <br/>\nShe is a very curious preteen and unschooling allows for the curiousity,<br/>\neven encourages it.  Bringing her home was the best thing I could have done<br/>\nfor her.  Both her teacher and the pyschologist supported me in bringing her<br/>\nhome.  We don&#39;t have issues with loud noises, bright lights, bullies. <br/>\nAmanda&#39;s stims are not made fun of.  She has not been on medication for the<br/>\nADHD since coming home four years ago.  Our family is happy with our<br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling life.  I think what I am trying to say Shelley, is<br/>\nthink carefully before you decide.  In some states, once you have a<br/>\ndiagnosis, you may be required to have your son in rehabilitation and have<br/>\nhome visits, etc.\r<br/>\nPeace,\r<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77248,"nextTopicId":77253}}
