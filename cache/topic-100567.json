If all we ever did was talk about all the reasons for <br/>\nnot doing drugs, then they&#39;re kind of left in the dark about why <br/>\nperfectly wonderful people they know do them. Leaving them in the dark <br/>\nlike that is leaving them with a sense that the world doesn&#39;t make <br/>\nsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing with churches and religions - if we disagree with some <br/>\nreligious teachings or actions, we still can help our kids understand <br/>\nwhy people DO agree with them. And, part of the reason is that a big <br/>\nchurch is fun - it is often filled with activity and people being <br/>\nreally nice and on their best behavior and everybody acting like your <br/>\nfriend and there can be awesome music and sometimes goodies like donuts <br/>\nand cocoa and religious services can be really emotionally touching and <br/>\npeople in churches do a lot of good works - helping kids in an <br/>\norphanage, running food banks, etc. (I know, there are churches that <br/>\nare definitely NOT fun - there are punitive scary places preaching <br/>\npunitive scary messages and that are strict and anti-kid - but I&#39;m not <br/>\ntalking about those.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy next-door neighbor was Mormon and I attended church activities with <br/>\nher for YEARS. My parents were definitely not fans of the Mormon church <br/>\nand, over the years, we talked about the teachings. But always in a way <br/>\nthat was reasonably respectful of my friends there. I was 16 when I <br/>\nsuddenly &quot;got it&quot; that there were actual racist teachings - (since <br/>\nchanged, but in those days there were prohibitions against blacks being <br/>\nfully integrated into the church). I quit going to the youth activities <br/>\nthen and there and had a tearful goodbye when I explained to some of my <br/>\nfriends why I would never come back. They even got me to go talk to the <br/>\nbishop so he could explain to me what the rationale was - but I didn&#39;t <br/>\nbuy it.

I do realize that children have differing personalities. We have 8 children between the two of us, and certainly they run the gamut of personality. I am curious, since I have stated repeatedly that I have several children of varying ages, why you would assume that they all have similiar personalities? I have not found that to normally be the case within families, especially large one, or ones with large age differences. <br/>\n <br/>\nAs I said before, a couple of my children are very strong willed, and would be more likely to refuse to do something if I pushed than they would to acquiese.<br/>\n <br/>\nOf course I can only know how my personal family has reacted to our personal parenting methods. However, I have a large family, with children of many different ages, so it is a slightly more respresentative sample, perhaps, than a family with one child. I also have a grown child, and two older teens, so it seemed that I could say with some credibility that our method seems to have worked, since I have seen the results in children who reached the age of being able to make their own decisions and act on them, emotionally, physically, and financially. I am not exactly assuming that they will eventually realize they have their own choices, and the right to their own beliefs, etc. I am seeing that they understand and embrace that.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe strive very much to parent respectfully, and treat our children with respect. It is the cornerstone of our parenting philosophy. My goal is to always treat every child as a person, not a &quot;child&quot; or &quot;my&quot; child, or as &quot;less than&quot; because of age or lack of independent ability. Childhood is not preparation for life, it is life. However, our living together encompasses respect for ourselves, and the modeling of respecting every individual&#39;s values, choices and beliefs. <br/>\n <br/>\nI believe it has worked with our family not because it is personality dependent, but because of the effort we have put into discussing ideals, modeling respect, and showing our children in countless ways that their opinions are valuable, as are our own. I am simply making the point that it is not always necessary to *only* consider the child&#39;s point of view in order to have children who still make their own decisions and choices independent of the parents. Nor is it neccesarily controlling a child to say that I personally am not comfortable with buying or doing something the child wants. I have much more respect for my children than to assume that they are incapable of understanding that others have values, desires, and beliefs that are equally important. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe feeling I get from some is that it is somehow not a good thing to have mutual respect, that it is better for the child if they are respected regardless of the impact that has on the values or opinions of others. I am saying that has not been my experience. Although I can see how some kids have the kind of personality that might make that neccessary, I think that with enough compassion, respect, and honesty from the parents that almost every child can enjoy and understand mutual respect. The most self effacing of our children holds their own with the most opinionated, even though they are outnumbered in our particular family. Perhaps the harder thing for us is the number of opinionated people who disagree with one another. However, it still works.<br/>\n <br/>\nMutual respect is also close to a neccessity when you have several children with varying beliefs, values and personalities, especially as they get older. As I have tried to be honest and upfront about our family, and tried to make it clear when things were my choice alone and when they became more individual choices, it has occurred to me that my children also do this among themselves. They each have strong opinions and beliefs, and have learned to share those with each other while not insisting that the others go along with them.<br/>\n <br/>\nI see that you have misunderstood my point, since you feel that I am offering an opinion on controlling children. I am sorry if I have not been clear enough. It would be a mistake to think that our &quot;method&quot; of mutual respect is control. It is just another possibility in living with children that enables the children to discover and honor their own beliefs and values while also living with other people who honor their own beliefs and values. <br/>\n <br/>\nAriella<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
