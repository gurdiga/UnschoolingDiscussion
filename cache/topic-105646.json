My dh, two ds and I regularly watch episodes of our favorite shows or movies in the evenings.  The problem is that this time together all too often results in an emotional scene where everyone ends up feeling bad.  My younger son Julian (9) usually has a lot of questions about what is going on in the show.  No problem so far.  But, when my dh or I try to answer his question (calmly, with no irritation or impatience) he usually doesn&#39;t understand imediately and then he begins to get upset (sometimes he is upset when he first asks the question).  He gets this tone of voice which sounds like he is about to cry and his facial expression screws up into something like anger or frustration. We (dh and I) do our best to stay calm and explain in different ways to help him understand.  Sometimes we do stay calm, manage to help Julian reach some kind of understanding and he calms down.  Other times one or both of us shows<br/>\n irritation and frustration and raise our voice(s) and of course that just makes things much worse.  It gets more complicated when our older son Charles (12) gets angry and upset because he is tired of spending more time waiting for his brother to understand than watching the show.<br/>\n <br/>\nI should add that this doesn&#39;t just come up during TV watching.  Julian frequently gets very emotional when he is trying to understand anything that comes up in our day to day lives.  Often, he seems to have formed an expected response in his mind.  When we don&#39;t answer him with his expected response he doesn&#39;t seem to &quot;hear&quot; what we say at all.  It&#39;s like he totally discounts anything that doesn&#39;t fit the mold he has prepared in his mind.  We try explaining a different way.  Still not what he wants to hear. He really starts to melt down.  Later, if we repeat the first answer (or one of the other explainations) it may finally &quot;click&quot;.  Then he invariably says something like &quot;Finally! An answer to my question. Why didn&#39;t you say that in the first place?!&quot;  (Excuse me a moment while I relive the incredible frustration this comment evokes)  If we point out that we DID say it in the first place he says he never heard us say that. Probably we should just keep our mouths shut once he<br/>\n understands.  Sometimes I am tempted to record these conversations just so I can make sure that I am not going crazy or remembering what I said completely wrong.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe thing I am really worried about here is the emotional aspect.  I don&#39;t mind taking time to explain over and over again until he understands. But he gets soooo upset and I feel so bad for him.  And so often I (or dh or Charles) end up getting upset.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have learned that he is a very visual person.  So I try to use visual aids whenever I can in these situations. Some help but not enough.<br/>\n <br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\nTIA<br/>\nCaprice<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64197,"nextTopicId":105738}}
