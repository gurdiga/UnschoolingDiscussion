Bus or car? Old house or new? Cloth diapers or<br/>\ndisposable? Some choices have a huge impact on the environment; others<br/>\nare of negligible importance. To those of us who care about our quality<br/>\nof life and what is happening to the earth, this is a vastly important<br/>\nissue. In these pages, the Union of Concerned Scientists help inform<br/>\nconsumers about everyday decisions that significantly affect the<br/>\nenvironment. For example, a few major decisions -- such as the choice of<br/>\na house or vehicle -- have such a disproportionately large affect on the<br/>\nenvironment that minor environmental infractions shrink by comparison. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis book identifies the 4 Most Significant Consumer-Related<br/>\nEnvironmental Problems, the 7 Most Damaging Spending Categories, 11<br/>\nPriority Actions, and 7 Rules for Responsible Consumption. Learn what you<br/>\ncan do to have a truly significant impact on our world from the people<br/>\nwho are at the forefront of scientific research.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcerpts:<br/>\n<br/>\nConsumers are often severely limited in their choices, and the economic<br/>\nmarket is frequently structured in such a way that makes environmentally<br/>\nsound options unattractive. In other cases, businesses and other<br/>\ninstitutions, rather than individual consumers, are the key<br/>\ndecision-makers. Government can, and should, help expand the choices,<br/>\nmake responsible behavior appealing, and influence the behavior of<br/>\ninstitutions. Good government policies are needed for action on the<br/>\npersonal lifestyle level to succeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nReviews:<br/>\n<br/>\nToo many people drive their Land Rovers to the grocery store and think<br/>\nthat &#39;paper or plastic&#39; is a meaningful choice. The Consumer&#39;s Guide To<br/>\nEffective Environmental Choices will help you distinguish the crucial<br/>\nfrom the trivial and make choices that are congruent with your values. <br/>\n<br/>\nDenis Hayes, Chair, Earth Day 2000 <br/>\nThis engaging book gives consumers the information they need to vote with<br/>\ntheir wallets for a better environmental future. <br/>\n<br/>\nGary Hirshberg, President, Stonyfield Farm Yogurt <br/>\nAbout The Author:<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Brower, Ph.D., is a physicist and expert on energy and<br/>\nenvironmental issues. <br/>\n<br/>\nWarren Leon, Ph.D., is a deputy director for programs at the Union of<br/>\nConcerned Scientists.
