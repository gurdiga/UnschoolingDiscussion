Make a sign and post it above the sink.  Maybe it will say, &quot;Watch the <br/>\nbubbles&quot; -- as in, look at the bubbles, look at how the light hits them.  Put <br/>\n&quot;too much&quot; liquid soap in so you can have lots of lather.  Look at your child&#39;s <br/>\nhands, in among those mountains of bubbles, tiny and yet capable.  Maybe your <br/>\nsign will say, &quot;Feel the warmth,&quot; -- meaning the warm water and the warm tone <br/>\nin your child&#39;s voice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe bubbles and the warm feel of the water are what I like about washing <br/>\ndishes.  I replace the water often because I like the fresh water with a mountain <br/>\nof bubbles on top. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point here is to find what you like about it, what your senses enjoy <br/>\nabout it, and write down a reminder.  Focus on getting your senses involved so <br/>\nthat the &quot;nagging&quot; part of your mind can relax and be quiet.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  If you&#39;re not in the mood to do that, get a a separate dish tub or let <br/>\nyour child use a different sink.  Lay a towel on the floor if it&#39;s going to get <br/>\nmessy.  Give her (him?  sorry, I don&#39;t remember) the unbreakable things, the <br/>\nnon-sharp silverware, and let your child go at it.  If the tub is on the floor <br/>\nnear you while you wash, you can talk while you both work.  Or put on some <br/>\nmusic that you can both work to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize these may not work for your situation, but if they do, great!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4324016,"authorName":"Kelly Lenhart","from":"&quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; &lt;mina@...&gt;","profile":"mommamina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Doing instead of wishing","postDate":"1076294122","msgId":90601,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxYjQwMWMzZWViNSQ4MjA5M2E4MCRmZDAwYThjMEBKZW5ueT4=","referencesHeader":"PDNlLjNhZDI1MmQyLjJkNTdmOGRjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":90560,"nextInTopic":90609,"prevInTime":90600,"nextInTime":90602,"topicId":90519,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... is ...

I have five children and have often felt <br/>\nthat it is too hard to have them directly around me all the time...especially <br/>\nwhen they were toddlers.  Sometimes I just wanted to get something done and <br/>\nthink my own thoughts uninterrupted while doing it.  I often thought I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nbe an unschooler because I had too many children, and I tend to be rather <br/>\nintroverted.

It also helps if I continuously <br/>\nchoose to trust them instead of control them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToday I took my 6yo, Lia, to the mall for her birthday.

They were having a great time taking <br/>\noff their shoes and tossing them away, and then running after them, giggling <br/>\ngleefully. She was telling them in a big voice about how &quot;angry&quot; she was that <br/>\nthey weren&#39;t &quot;listening&quot; and then complaining into her CELLPHONE about how <br/>\nharried she was, and snatching them back by their little arms (I almost went over <br/>\nat that) to shove them back in the row she was guarding.<br/>\n<br/>\n       Their party got louder and wilder until finally a sheriff came over <br/>\nand interested them in his uniform for a few minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n       I figured she was a paid daycare provider but my 14-year-old assumed <br/>\nthey were septuplets, or siblings with a couple of playmates -- anyway, that <br/>\nthe woman was Mom and not paid caregiver.  I was assuming that no Mom would ever <br/>\nhave decided to take them all to the library in a thunderstorm in the first <br/>\nplace on a Friday afternoon, in all those separate strollers, at least not <br/>\nwithout a carefully calibrated battalion of helpers! &lt;g&gt; And if she had, and <br/>\ngotten stuck there, she&#39;d have been reading to them to keep them entertained.<br/>\n<br/>\n       We never did find out what the real story was, but we wound up having <br/>\nan interesting discussion about it, so that was a good thing and relevant to <br/>\nOUR unschooling for that reason alone. We went on from there to get the <br/>\nLooneyTunes DVDs, in the rainstorm, because it was something else we chose to do <br/>\nbecause of a current interest. <br/>\n<br/>\n       My reason for telling the story here, now, is that both the library <br/>\nand the cartoons for TV were part of our fun together (we left dishes in the <br/>\nsink btw &lt;eg&gt;) because we were together doing what we wanted to do together. <br/>\nOTOH, there was no way those little ones were having a good experience even though <br/>\nthey were &quot;at the library&quot; and their probably-conscientious parents were doin<br/>\ng what society expected, paying some preschool caregiver to provide them with <br/>\nnot just care but stimulating educational experiences -- and it turned out to <br/>\nbe not only NOT enriching or educational, but borderline dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\n      So I am thinking that whether it&#39;s the library and books, or tv and <br/>\nvideogames -- it can&#39;t be wrong if you really enjoy it together and it can&#39;t be <br/>\nmade right if you just don&#39;t.
