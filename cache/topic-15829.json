They now have 3 teams<br/>\nwith four doctors and a community activist in each.  NONE of the<br/>\ninternational aid has reached the rural areas where they are, and they<br/>\ndon&#39;t expect it will (they expect the big relief organizations will<br/>\nconcentrate in Bhuj and Ahmedabad and then go home).  Biggest problem in<br/>\nthe rural areas is clean drinking water -- we are getting some aid from<br/>\nthe American Friends Service Committee for portable water purification<br/>\nequipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who wish, tax deductible donations should be made out to the<br/>\nGandhian Foundation, and sent to me --<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert<br/>\n1717 18th Court NE<br/>\nOlympia, WA 98506<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will consolidate the funds, and get them through to Gujarat daily.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\ndavid<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Should now be considered the definitive work on homeschooling....an<br/>\nintellectual tour de force.&quot; --Joseph Chilton Pearce.
