Well meaning, but mostly <br/>\nineffectual. My son was teased, kicked and spat on in public school (fourth <br/>\nand fifth grade). The perpetrators would be told to apologize and then would <br/>\nsmirk at him behind the teachers&#39; back. It never stopped, he just stopped <br/>\ngoing to them for help because he knew it was a waste of time. Probably to <br/>\nthe teachers, it looked like things were &quot;more peaceful.&quot; Next I put him in a <br/>\nvery academic (and expensive) private school. In the private school, it was <br/>\nten times worse. There, in 6th and half of 7th grade, the kids were bigger, <br/>\nstronger, more accomplished at being sneaky. My son was teased, kicked, spat <br/>\non, punched, bodyslammed, insulted all day, threatened, and shunned. The dean <br/>\nof students at the school was a really nice guy, who could not have been more <br/>\nuseless. Every time someone did something to my son, thay&#39;d all have a big <br/>\nheart to heart. The bullies would put on their sweetest and most contrite <br/>\nexpressions, say a &quot;heartfelt&quot; apology to my son, and then call him a &quot;fagot&quot; <br/>\nthe minute they&#39;d left the presence of the adult. On the few occasions that <br/>\nsome sort of punishment was meted out, they&#39;d get him back for it. The <br/>\npunishments were never as bad as the crimes, and they all knew it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, I realized (I can be incredibly thick sometimes) that he had only <br/>\ntwo choices in such situations. Response A, was to hide out with all the <br/>\nother nonconformists in the library or artroom and keep his mouth shut the <br/>\nrest of the time. This group accepts that they are somehow inferior. Response <br/>\nB, was to join the the nasty bullies and &quot;popular&quot; kids by being nasty just <br/>\nlike them. This group assumes that they are naturally superior, because <br/>\nanyone who disagrees is beaten emotionally or physically into submission or <br/>\noblivion. I started to see my son turning into a nasty.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe chose response C. We started homeschooling. We are still feeling our way <br/>\nalong, and not quite sure how to proceed. We don&#39;t quite know what approach <br/>\nwe&#39;ll end up with, but I am at least sure I&#39;ll never leave him in such a <br/>\nhopeless situation again, for even 5 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last point. I tried to get the school to implement an anti-bullying <br/>\nprogram that would be preventative by holding many supervised discussions <br/>\nabout acceptance of nonconformity, and many other issues that concern kids <br/>\nand human beings in general. But at the same time, I did expect them to <br/>\nimplement consequences (yes I know that&#39;s a fancy word for punishment) when <br/>\npeople are unkind or just plain cruel to others. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I tell my kids, is that not only is cruel behavior wrong, and totally <br/>\nunacceptable, but in this society, if you grow up and punch somebody you <br/>\ndon&#39;t like or agree with, you go to jail. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many unpleasant and pleasant natural consequences for our behavior. <br/>\nChildhood is the best time to learn this, with the help of our family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Teaching kids kindness and adult ADD","postDate":"1025263497","msgId":38685,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5NDFCRkM5LkEwRjMlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGU2LjJhMjMyZGY2LjJhNGQyNjlmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38680,"nextInTopic":38691,"prevInTime":38684,"nextInTime":38686,"topicId":38680,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

During the summer now I am subbing with little <br/>\nkiddos.  There is often a hit given; we stop, and yes, we talk, BUT the child <br/>\nknows they owe the other one an apology.  AND, the other child needs to <br/>\naccept the apology.  You can&#39;t imagine in one week, how much mellower these <br/>\nchildren have become.<br/>\nAnd yes, I do have one volatile boy.  His parents are split up. he&#39;s mad.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t blame him.  Daily, however, I remind him it is okay to be angry and mad <br/>\nBUT when he is yelling at all of us and then kicking other kids around him <br/>\nand calling names, that type of anger isn&#39;t acceptable.  However, I tell him <br/>\nand suggest he can go by himself to another part of the room or restroom to <br/>\nyell and kick.  And I ask him to let me know when he is calmer and when he is <br/>\nready for some &quot;hug&quot; time.  The hugging is really what calms him and what he <br/>\nlacks.  Yep. LOVE!  That has been my overall evaluation in the school <br/>\nsetting.<br/>\nIn our home, hitting just isn&#39;t allowed , period!  Controlling?  perhaps!  <br/>\nToo bad!  We are not into violence that is physical. We don&#39;t like verbal <br/>\nviolence either, but we are more tolerant in the home of this, but highly <br/>\nencourage our children to talk  respectfully as much as possible.<br/>\nJust a few thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow a question..<br/>\nDo any of you know anything about adult ADD?<br/>\nYou can email me privately about this.  Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBj<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38912,"nextTopicId":38824}}
