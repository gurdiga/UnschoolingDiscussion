For example, he tried to say the silent e&#39;s on the ends of words, so<br/>\n&gt; we talked about how e is quiet but manipulative, because he changes the<br/>\n&gt; sound of the other letters but doesn&#39;t say anything himself.

Of course.  But phonetic oriented exposure sounds very<br/>\n&gt; teachy, and you don&#39;t need to teach him to read.

I started with<br/>\nthe book Teach Your Child to Read in 100 easy lessons when he was about 5.<br/>\nHe caught on to the whole phonics thing, and seemed to have little trouble<br/>\nreading, started with easy readers and worked up to chapter books. He&#39;s not<br/>\na voracious reader, though, but has tackled a thick book if he has a real<br/>\ninterest.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger son (9) started reading instruction in much the same way and at<br/>\nthe same age (around 5). But things were so different with him. We also used<br/>\nthe same 100 easy lessons book, but only made it about 10-20 lessons in and<br/>\nwere having incredible difficulties and frustrations. He really wanted to<br/>\nlearn, especially because his older brother could read and learned from the<br/>\nsame book. But the book didn&#39;t &quot;click&quot; with him like it had with his<br/>\nbrother. He wasn&#39;t getting phonics AT ALL. Being the good homeschooling mom<br/>\nI was ;-), I bought a good, age appropriate phonics workbook to help him<br/>\nlearn the concepts of sounding out words. Oh, how he struggled to do each<br/>\nand every page of that book, and I just didn&#39;t understand why he wasn&#39;t<br/>\ngetting it. I devised other phonics word games, used index cards to label<br/>\nthings around the house, and had him read aloud to me. He and I both were so<br/>\nfrustrated, and I even thought he was purposely being<br/>\nstubborn and willfull by NOT &quot;getting&quot; phonics and reading. W even got the<br/>\nPhonics game (a gift from my mom) and as you can guess, it did NO good at<br/>\nall, in fact it was a big joke IMO, especially after seeing those<br/>\ncommercials again.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year in Sept. I started unschooling and stopped doing all reading<br/>\ninstruction, workbooks and the like. I left him completely alone and since<br/>\nthen, in this past year, he has made such progress in learning to read on<br/>\nhis own. Reading is coming to him, slowly but surely, and I think the thing<br/>\nthat helped most was me taking the pressure off of him and accepting him<br/>\njust as he is, and knowing that he is at the level that *he* is supposed to<br/>\nbe at right now.<br/>\nAll thanks to unschooling. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband says that he remembers being exactly the same way in school<br/>\n(having difficulty reading) when he was little. In fact, that difficulty<br/>\ncarried right on through all his school years, and even to this day. My dh<br/>\nsays he can&#39;t read a book for pleasure, like a fiction book. He says that if<br/>\nhe reads a chapter and puts the book down, the next time he picks it up he<br/>\nforgot the story so far and has to reread the chapter he already read. He<br/>\nonly reads computer technical manuals to help himself learn specific things,<br/>\nbut never reads for enjoyment. He attributes this reading handicap to being<br/>\nleft-handed, and says it&#39;s the same way with my younger son, who is also<br/>\nleft-handed. We know other kids who have reading/learning difficulties and<br/>\nmost if not all just happen to be left-handed and it goes along with his<br/>\ntheory - that left-handed people have a harder time learning things in<br/>\ngeneral, at least in &quot;normal&quot; ways. Well, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true or not<br/>\nand I tell him it&#39;s not fair to generalize and stereotype people that way.<br/>\nBut that&#39;s his opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92238,"nextTopicId":92245}}
