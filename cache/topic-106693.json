I suspect that you  don&#39;t want <br/>\nthem pointed out and just want it known that you don&#39;t agree with  what&#39;s being <br/>\nsaid because you have reasons that make sense to you.  <br/>\nBut, this is a discussion list and the purpose of the list is to hold ideas  <br/>\nup to examination and to help people make rational decisions. If anyone  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want their ideas examined, its best not to post them.  <br/>\nHere&#39;s what I see:  <br/>\nIf your kids are overweight then you&#39;re offering general advice based on a  <br/>\nnongeneral situation. (There *are* other options besides control even for  <br/>\nspecial circumstances.)  <br/>\nIf your kids are not overweight, then you are imposing a solution to a  <br/>\nproblem that you only fear may exist in the future.  <br/>\nIf by late onset diabetes you mean type 2, the connection isn&#39;t directly to  <br/>\nsugar but to being overweight. The problem is taking in too many calories and  <br/>\nnot expending enough and becoming overweight. Being overweight doesn&#39;t cause  <br/>\ntype 2 diabetes, e.g. all overweight people become diabetic, but being  <br/>\noverweight seems to be a factor.<br/>\nMy kids recognize that when  they do eat a ton of sugar (say after a birthday <br/>\nparty or what have you) they  feel physically ill and grumpy... My seven year <br/>\nold o naturally doesn&#39;t care for  refined sugar, he will choose an apple over <br/>\nbirthday cake every time. Our family  candy rule is three pieces per day <br/>\nafter a healthy meal... (and they are welcome  to throw away and try again if they <br/>\nhate something, so it&#39;s actually  three...).  <br/>\nIf they aren&#39;t drawn to sugar, then why limit  it?<br/>\nThey are nine and seven and they have no problem with  limits.on TV, movies, <br/>\ncomputer time, candy consumption, etc.  <br/>\nIf by &quot;no problem&quot; you mean they don&#39;t complain, depending on  personality <br/>\nand family atmosphere, some kids will learn that complaining isn&#39;t  worth the <br/>\neffort.  <br/>\nIf by &quot;no problem&quot; you mean that without limits they choose the way you  <br/>\nwould choose for them, then why have limits?  <br/>\n(I&#39;d be concerned, though, if my daughter were making the same decisions I  <br/>\nwould. It would suggest to me that she was memorizing rules rather than  <br/>\nlearning what&#39;s right for her by experimentation. We try to help people see  that <br/>\nchildren will choose what&#39;s right for *them*, though, not choose what  we&#39;d <br/>\nchoose for them. They *will* choose differently. But they won&#39;t eat  nothing but <br/>\nsugar and fat, and won&#39;t do nothing but watch TV and play video  games.)  <br/>\nSome people, such as those who are naturally drawn to rules, who live under  <br/>\nlimitations accept the rules and stick to them. They live in fear and the  <br/>\nrules are like talismans that will keep the boogeyman away. What happens when  <br/>\nthey are faced with new situations that they don&#39;t have rules in place for?  <br/>\nPeople often extrapolate from the nonsense and extend the rules. But rational  <br/>\nthought would reveal shoddy foundations for decision making.  <br/>\nIf the reasons behind rules make sense, then there isn&#39;t a reason to make a  <br/>\nrule. But people who follow rules, aren&#39;t learning how to make decisions. They <br/>\n are only learning to follow someone else&#39;s rules.  <br/>\nIf the reasons behind rules are nonsense, then people memorize nonsense and  <br/>\nuse that as a foundation for decision making.  <br/>\nIf your kids have memorized that too much sugar will cause diabetes so it&#39;s  <br/>\ngood to avoid sugar, they&#39;ve memorized nonsense and are basing decisions on  <br/>\nnonsense.  <br/>\nIf they recognize that sugar will make them feel yucky, then, without  rules, <br/>\nthey are free to decide each time if the future yucky feeling is worth  it or <br/>\nnot. They&#39;ll be listening to their bodies, not a rule they&#39;ve memorized.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThey are nine and seven and they have no problem with  limits on TV, movies, <br/>\ncomputer time, candy consumption, etc.  <br/>\nIf they are memorizing rules that say any time beyond x spent on  TV, movies, <br/>\ncomputer is damaging, then they&#39;re memorizing your responses to  your fears <br/>\nnot listening to their bodies or coming to rational decisions  through trial <br/>\nand error about what&#39;s right for their unique selves.  <br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________<br/>\n_What do you &quot;have to&quot;  do? _ (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschool/haveto)\">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/haveto)</a> *** <br/>\n_rules vs. principles _ (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/rules)\">http://sandradodd.com/rules)</a> ***_ how important is it? _ <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/chore/option)\">http://sandradodd.com/chore/option)</a> ***_ unschooling main page _ <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling)\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling)</a> *** _other parenting considerations _ <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/life)\">http://sandradodd.com/life)</a> .  <br/>\nAlso by Joyce Fetteroll: _Transcript of Joyce&#39;s presentation at  the 2002 <br/>\nLive & Learn Conference _ (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/joyce/talk)\">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/talk)</a> and _&quot;Always say y<br/>\nes.
