When she gets tired of hearing them she just turns down her hearing aide!  (wouldn&#39;t that be nice some times?)<br/>\nShe is the one who mentioned to my Mom that she is bored and never gets out.  I think she would really enjoy going outside and watching the kids.  She always worries about us doing to much for her.  She was always taking care<br/>\nof everyone else.  I keep telling her it is about time we return the favor.<br/>\nAnn<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuerst@...\">fuerst@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuerst@...\">fuerst@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ann,<br/>\n&gt; I think you will want to listen to your grandmother on what she wants to do in regard to &#39;getting out of the house&#39;.  What Lisa found with her grandmother is typical (i.e., short outings,  a few hours,  to familiar places).<br/>\n&gt; Grandparents may not want to be upfront about physical/medical limitations (they often don&#39;t want to worry or burden family).  Try to be respectful of her wishes.<br/>\n&gt; I am speaking from a decade of experience in geriatric social work.<br/>\n&gt; I imagine your children will benefit greatly from this trip!
