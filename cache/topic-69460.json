He is an engineer-type of<br/>\nkid and always designing and building things, but the minifigs have truly<br/>\nopened up his creative side as well. Most of his friends that are boys<br/>\nhowever do not do this, they stick with building space ships or whatever and<br/>\nthe minifigs are just props to fly around in the airplanes.

When something breaks, my 4yo and dh sit together and fix <br/>\nthem.  If it is really complicated dh does it and ds will count and <br/>\nfind pieces, etc.  If it is easy then we will guide him with the <br/>\ninstruction book.  Lately, he has begun to rebuild some as they break <br/>\nor change them himself.  However, most of the time he uses it the <br/>\nsame way he uses all his action figures.  I am giving him time and <br/>\nthink the more he interacts with the Legos, the more he will feel <br/>\nconfident in changing things and making more complex ideas.  Maybe <br/>\nthey do not feel confident enough to do it on their own yet?  My ds <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t.  He has a regular set that he does not use on his own too <br/>\noften, he needs interaction for these toys otherwise I think he just <br/>\ndoes not know where to begin.  Maybe you can try doing some of it <br/>\nwith them to get it started?  The Lego magazine is free and they will <br/>\nsend you a catalog for free!
