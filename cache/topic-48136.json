I don&#39;t  see much <br/>\ndifference, just age.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then, just now, my son recalled the one and only time his Father hit him <br/>\nwith a long stick. It almost ended my marriage, we split up not long after <br/>\nthat......<br/>\nBut, just recalling that moment made him cry. And reminded me of the awful <br/>\ndamage we did. I apologized for not stopping it, or leaving the house with <br/>\nthe kids that day and not coming back until he agreed to not hit his son.<br/>\nHow can anyone coming to this list not hear the pain in people&#39;s stories?<br/>\nHow can anyone trying to follow the example of Christ not see that he would <br/>\nNEVER have advocated hitting anyone, much less helpless children?<br/>\nAnd how can another person come on and defend someone like that? This list <br/>\nisn&#39;t about tolerance, it&#39;s about unschooling and that is also gentle <br/>\nparenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Trevor if being spanked helped him obey God, he said &quot;No, it made me <br/>\nhate my Dad&quot; <br/>\nSo good luck with producing anything but fear and hate in your family by  <br/>\nhitting innocent people.<br/>\nIt ain&#39;t gonna happen.<br/>\nViolence produces more violence, anger and fear.<br/>\nLove produces more love, peace and joy.<br/>\nLove is always the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48012,"nextTopicId":48147}}
