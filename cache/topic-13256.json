K Rowling can be used in the region&#39;s public school classrooms. The \ndecision was made by school board administrators yesterday. \n<p>About 150 people filled the board room, booing and cheering alternately \ndepending on the speakers&#39; views. Most in the crowd seemed to support the \nrestrictions. \n<p>Many left before the board actually voted to drop the restrictions. \n<p>Parents who object to the Potter books must file a written complaint with \ntheir local school under the board&#39;s existing learning materials selection \npolicy. \n<p>It will then be up to each school principal to decide if the books are to be \nused. \n<p>If a school decides to go ahead and use the Potter series in the classroom \nand parents still are unhappy, their children can be given ``alternative \nstudies,&#39;&#39; which in most cases will be another book, said program superintendent \nBev Freedman. \n<p>She had said earlier this month she was aware of about 20 telephone \ncomplaints and about 10 letters from parents objecting to the use of the books \nat various Durham Region schools. \n<p>Trustees last night heard emotional pleas from 16 parents on both sides of \nthe Harry Potter controversy. \n<p>But they later endorsed the action to remove the restrictions by a vote of \n7-4. \n<p>Dianne Kelly of Whitby said she couldn&#39;t understand how any school board \ncould even consider ``banning&#39;&#39; a book in the year 2000. \n<p>``In a time when there is so much competition for children&#39;s attention, these \nbooks are encouraging them to read in a way few other books have,&#39;&#39; she said in \nan interview. ``I&#39;ve read them all and they are a lot of fun.&#39;&#39; \n<p>But David Castell of Oshawa said his 12-year-old son Kyle stands a chance of \nbeing ostracized by the rest of his class if he chooses not to take part in a \ncoming study of a Harry Potter book with his Grade 7 classmates at Kedron public \nschool. \n<p>``My son decided of his own volition this book wasn&#39;t for him. \n<p>``I can&#39;t understand why in a democratic society a school board would allow \nthis sort of thing to happen.&#39;&#39; \n<p>The board directive was sent out last April after a dozen parents and one \nOshawa school trustee claimed the four books in the series glorified witchcraft. \n\n<p>The books describe the adventures of orphan Harry Potter who goes to the \nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. \n<p>Potter finds a new life and much respect by becoming a wizard. He uses his \nnew powers to help others and to fight evil. \n<p>Oshawa school trustee Jane Weist, who first raised the matter at a board \nmeeting last spring, still believes the book should be restricted in the \nregion&#39;s schools. \n<p>``As far as I am concerned the books teach witchcraft and putting it in such \na nice little story about a little boy simply puts a sugar coating on it.&#39;&#39; \n<p>She said with the restriction removed, parents who do not want their children \nexposed to Harry Potter will have to ask their children to stand out in the hall \nwhile it is being discussed. \n<p>Durham board Chair Doug Ross said it was never the intention of the board to \nban the books or place such a strong restriction on their use. \n<p>``If it was going to cause a war with parents and half of the kids wouldn&#39;t \nbe attending, then common sense would tell the teacher or principal to use \nanother book in class.&#39;&#39; </p></font></div>\n<br>\n<tt>\nWelcome to Idaho Witches, Wiccans, &amp; Pagans.
