KEEP THEM COMING!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are 5 (Evan) and 2.5 (Aidan) and BOTH are teaching themselves <br/>\nreading with software games. We eat, think, sleep computers in this <br/>\nhousehold. That&#39;s why the kids want to work with them now ---paper is <br/>\nnot of much consequence to them (although we read a lot).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is an Internet artist and software developer; I <br/>\ncollaborate with him in NetArt projects and am a webEditor so our <br/>\nkids have basically were born with computers around them. Mark even <br/>\ndeveloped on of his NetArt pieces with Evan&#39;s input when he was about <br/>\n1 year old.  Since they see mommy and daddy making fun, game like art <br/>\nwith computers at all times of day, they want to play-work with them <br/>\nas well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have used JUMPSTART SPANISH and I highly recommend it for <br/>\nintroducing Spanish to kids. I have seen other things and they pretty <br/>\nmuch suck (I taught Spanish & Portuguese in college for 8 years). I <br/>\nhave seriously considered producing one of my own for more in depth <br/>\nlearning of the language.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe love ARTHUR and there are 2 cd&#39;s that are out of print --ARTHURs <br/>\nTEACHER TROUBLE & ARTHURs READING RACE. They are excellent. The first <br/>\none is particularly good because kids can learn to read the story in <br/>\nboth English and Spanish. I wonder if there is a Canadian version <br/>\nwith French in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else have we used? Oh, GREEN EGGS & HAM is pretty good too. I <br/>\nalso got a BLUES CLUES cd and Aidan likes it a lot --it is a little <br/>\nto basic for Evan.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there are 2 websites we use all the time: NICKJR.com and <br/>\nPBSKIDS.org. They have a lot of interactive games, lesson plans, <br/>\nprintouts, music ... you name it. They are excellent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering about the phonics cd because our libraries do not <br/>\nhave it; so there is no way for us to try it out first. I SPY is so <br/>\ngood, with its riddles and such, that I am buying it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLiza</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38902,"nextTopicId":38978}}
