I don&#39;t limit computer<br/>\ngames, except that we only have one computer and they need to quit when<br/>\nit&#39;s my turn or time for dinner, etc.  Computer usage hasn&#39;t been a<br/>\nproblem (yet).  They sometimes will play for a long time, but they<br/>\nusually get tired of it or we need to go somewhere.  I&#39;m hoping to have<br/>\nanother computer in a year or two.  They are 8 and 5 now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do limit watching TV.  We don&#39;t have cable, which greatly limits TV<br/>\nappeal!  8 yr old rarely asks to watch a movie, but will watch if one is<br/>\ngoing.  I&#39;m not really sure why I have this limit, except that too much<br/>\nTV seems to &quot;dull&quot; them.  We did have a TV WEEK after Christmas.  5yr dd<br/>\nasked if she could check out her limit of movies at the library, so we<br/>\neach did and came home with 15 movies that we could keep for a week and I<br/>\nsaid they could watch whenever they wanted.  I&#39;m happy to say that we<br/>\nended up not seeing all of them.  In fact, she preferred to re-view one<br/>\nor two rather than see a new one.  But we did spend more time plopped on<br/>\nthe couch than normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Mother Dance (by same author as Dance of Anger, Lerner?), she writes<br/>\nof an experiment with her sons.  She designated a shelf in the pantry<br/>\nwhere they each had their own space.  They went to the store and they<br/>\neach got to buy their favorite candy.  Then mom made sure that the pantry<br/>\nwas always well stocked with their goodies and they had unlimited access.<br/>\n (Can you imagine?  Johnny, your M&Ms are running low.  Put it on the<br/>\ngrocery list!)  If I recall correctly, they at first overdid the sweets<br/>\nand then got tired of them.  In fact, she tells of her younger son<br/>\n&quot;sneaking&quot; grapes at a buffet party.  The parents were boycotting grapes<br/>\nbecause of worker issues, so they never had them in the house.  It&#39;s not<br/>\na homeschooling book, but I enjoyed reading her mothering insights.  Got<br/>\nsome good laughs too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nGain weight... Stay Active...
