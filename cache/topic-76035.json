I grew up in Back Bay in Boston, and in Newton.  We went to the North Shore a few times but never to your area.  I always wanted to go there.  Plus, we never want to spend the money to go back to MA but now we have a great excuse.  I think dh has also known that if we go back up, I won&#39;t want to leave.  It&#39;s prob. a good thing the conference isn&#39;t happening in the fall.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMadeline<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
