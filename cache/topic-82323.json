Are <br/>\nthey <br/>\nall plastic or are some wood? Do they come in different sizes? I hope someone <br/>\nknows. Sandra? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRecorders have two sizes very easy to come by, and four fairly easy, and two <br/>\nor three more obscure sizes in the teensy and gigantic range that the fanatics <br/>\nmight buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nEasy set:  <br/>\nSoprano (probably the one you got--the very bottom note is &quot;C&quot; so they call <br/>\nthem &quot;C&quot; recorders)<br/>\nAlto (called &quot;Treble&quot; in England) and is an &quot;F&quot; recorder (bottom note &quot;F&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she ends up playing by ear mostly, she can switch back and forth between <br/>\nthem without regard, just finding a key that&#39;s good (and easy for her) for the <br/>\npeople she&#39;s playing or singing with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she learns to play it reading  music, she&#39;ll need to pick one or the other <br/>\nand stick with it until she feels confident enough to learn a second set of <br/>\nnames for the same fingerings.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth instruments work the same way, but what&#39;s a C on the alto is a G on the <br/>\nsoprano (finger-wise).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re both &quot;C instruments&quot; in the larger scheme of life, meaning that when <br/>\nthere&#39;s a C on &quot;piano music&quot; that&#39;s the same C that&#39;s called C on a recorder.  <br/>\n(Sorry to touch on one of life&#39;s biggest mysteries here, but there are some <br/>\n&quot;band instruments&quot; which were pitched and labelled in ways that should have <br/>\nbeen prevented in the beginning, so that a clarinet&#39;s Bflat is a piano&#39;s C.  <br/>\nNever mind that!  Doesn&#39;t apply to recorders.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo If someone asks if a recorder is a C instrument, the answer is yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen within that truth, every other size is &quot;an F recorder&quot; which has nothing <br/>\nto do with the piano or &quot;real C.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey hands.  Some have a couple of keys to help with the reach.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time she&#39;s playing with groups (if that were to happen) they can tell <br/>\nher all about the other sizes; she&#39;ll see other people&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you get ready to buy another one, go to a music store in person if you <br/>\ncan, or e-mail me and I&#39;ll help you find a mailorder source. <br/>\n<br/>\nA cheap wooden one is not better than a good plastic one.<br/>\nAn expensive wooden one if out of most people&#39;s price range.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82290,"nextTopicId":82324}}
