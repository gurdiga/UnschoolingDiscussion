Just go with the flow is one of his favorite comments. He can have a very mean streak frequently. i try to give my children as much choice as I can, but we do have some boundaries. One is no namecalling or rude comments. If you disagree with someone or don&#39;t like what they are doing, express that. you have the right to say no or tell someone to stop when they violate your privacy or personal space. I have two children who seem to thrive on sarcastic, rude comments and putting other people down. One is my niece who only is with us for a little while. the other is the 14 yo.
