Even though they were not here they heard me say she was <br/>\ncoming and that is why I had to leave them somewhere else and the 3 <br/>\nyo did not want to come back home she was scared. Anyway they needed <br/>\nto set up a meeting for Monday the 17th for the new lady Tania to <br/>\nmeet them with out the first people there. I am trying to find <br/>\nsomeone to be with them when she questions them because I will not <br/>\nlet them do that again. It was amazing how many more lies came out at <br/>\nthat meeting they are now trying to say that I make even my 9 and 12 <br/>\nyear olds go for naps for 3-5hours every day and that I do not do <br/>\nanything that is a mothers reponsibly that I make my kids do it and <br/>\nso on. And my 5yo go a toy guitar and hit the 3yo in the eye and gave <br/>\nher a black eye I do not think it will be gone by Monday and I can <br/>\njust imagine what they will say about that. They still have not gave <br/>\nme anything in writing but say they will be doing several surprise <br/>\nand set-up meetings. I want to take them to court to stop this <br/>\nbecause everyone including us say this is unjustified.<br/>\nThanks for listening<br/>\nJackie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38300,"nextTopicId":38290}}
