So far, no response.  I would contact your<br/>\nlocal health department with concern about your pet rodents.  How is the<br/>\ndisease passed?  My initial feeling would be that if they  are kept<br/>\ninside and caged, pet rats or mice (and other rodents) should be OK.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Shelley<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  You might not want to mention &quot;pet rats&quot; specifically to the health<br/>\ndepartment.  Many people are so prejudiced against rats they will<br/>\nautomatically say  &quot;oooh, yuck&quot; with out giving any thought to the<br/>\nproblem.  Ironically, mice, gerbils, hamsters and guinea pigs are<br/>\nperfectly acceptable.  A shame, since they all of them, (with the<br/>\nexception of g.p.&#39;s), bite far more often then rats and are not nearly as<br/>\nsmart or lovable toward their human owners.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11917,"nextTopicId":11866}}
