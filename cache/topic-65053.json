Or how<br/>\nthe school system would completely discount any input from a parent about<br/>\ntheir child, even if the parent were an educated, reasonable person who was<br/>\narticulate and savvy.  It was really bizarre to me to watch school<br/>\npersonnel try to tell a parent about their child as if the parent didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow their child or understand that child&#39;s needs.
