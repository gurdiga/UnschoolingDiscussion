Please enlighten me.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t say why they&#39;re congratulating me, but to talk of mid-20th century <br/>\nGermans as though they were Americans from 2002 doesn&#39;t make sense.  It makes <br/>\nrhetorical sense (in the rhetoric-as-sneaky-tricks sense)  but not <br/>\nhistorical, geographical, sociological, anthropological or logical sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a little like saying the Catholic church in 1550 was violating the civil <br/>\nrights of heretics by not reading them their Miranda rights and that they <br/>\nshould have respected their freedom of religion in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo look at all the world through American eyes and judge them ignorant or <br/>\nbackward or mean or anything by our current standards and under our current <br/>\nlaws is to think and act as though we (current Americans, or in Ned&#39;s case <br/>\ncurrent American Libertarians) are the holders of pure truth and right, and <br/>\nthat others are slackers who should get with the (our) program.  That is <br/>\nethnocentrism.  It&#39;s a macro-political version of the descriptions of <br/>\ntoddlers&#39; awareness of themselves and the world.  If a toddler is a boy he <br/>\nmight think not being a boy is wrong.  If he has short hair he might think <br/>\nnot having short hair is wrong.  If he sleeps in his own bed, another toddler <br/>\nsleeping somewhere else is wrong.  They generalize from a small set of <br/>\nspecific knowledge.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want other descriptions and examples, here are some good ones I found <br/>\nwith google.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.iupui.edu/~anthkb/ethnocen.htm\">http://www.iupui.edu/~anthkb/ethnocen.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Speech/rccs/theory36.htm\">http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Speech/rccs/theory36.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.me-ontarget.com/Ethnocentrism.htm\">http://www.me-ontarget.com/Ethnocentrism.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40322,"nextTopicId":39870}}
