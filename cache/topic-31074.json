One that comes to mind is the value of modesty.  I feel that my daughters need to know that by wearing styles that are provocative, even if that is the in style, it sends a message that you want your body on display.  What traits do they value in a person?  If your friends won&#39;t like you if you don&#39;t where the same style clothes then maybe these are not the type of friendships you want to cultivate.  I make an effort to discuss many character traits with my kids because when I was a teenager, my mother did not talk to me about how mean I was being to one of my friends.  I regret to this day how I behaved.  Sure I&#39;ve come to realize that behavior was wrong but it would have been nice to have a talk about it then.  Maybe I would have been able to be proud of my character instead of ashamed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso values that we want our children to have an easier time adopting when they are older like eating right, exercising, the importance of personal hygiene.  For example, we talk about the value of exercise.  Sure I model these values by exercising regularly but I feel discussing why I exercise will help them become life long exercisers more easily.  I feel if this is done in a manner of pure discussion and not as a sermon, it will be well received.  I have decided that once my children are grown, the discussion of values must end.  They will have chosen their own,have no question of what ours are and therefore there could only be harm in further discussion.  I could go on and on but it would probably be more than anyone wants to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never been very clear as to what exactly a &quot;value&quot; is.  I just <br/>\nlooked it up in the dictionary - that didn&#39;t help much.  I guess, to me, <br/>\na value is something that is important to me.  I think it would be <br/>\npretty hard for me not to share these things with my boys as we just <br/>\nlive our lives every day.  Values are not something that I formally talk <br/>\nabout with my children.  I believe my actions and behaviors show them <br/>\nwhat my values are.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

If I thought life were &quot;value<br/>\nneutral&quot; I probably wouldn&#39;t be homeschooling.  My practice has been to work<br/>\nhard to &quot;brainwash&quot; (only partly kidding) my kids when they were young about<br/>\nmy values--knowing that as they get older and older they&#39;ll have many other<br/>\ninfluences, too.  I think if I give them a good base when I *do* have<br/>\ninfluence, they&#39;ll be better set to form their own set of values when<br/>\nthey&#39;re older....and hopefully they won&#39;t conflict with mine *too* much.<br/>\n(My older two--at 15 and 13 are now venturing off on their own values<br/>\npaths....not much conflict yet re: values, thankfully.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the key is to realize that as they *do* get older, you will<br/>\nnaturally have less influence and at that point trying to force your values<br/>\non your kids has a tendency to backfire.  I agree with the &quot;modeling&quot; points<br/>\nalready mentioned by Sarah and Mimi.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find my kids desperately want my opinions about value sorts of things.  My<br/>\nfavorite &quot;game&quot; is to listen to talk radio in the car and then pick some<br/>\npoint they&#39;re discussing and turn the radio off and discuss it ourselves.<br/>\n(We do this a *lot* with Dr. Laura and NPR talk shows!)  I *love* to play<br/>\ndevil&#39;s advocate with them.  I&#39;ll either ask them their opinion or present<br/>\none side and then ask them how they feel about the topic.....then play<br/>\ndevil&#39;s advocate and say &quot;but what about __&quot; (to give them the other side).<br/>\nIf it&#39;s an issue that I do have an opinion about, I&#39;ll eventually tell them<br/>\n(after I&#39;ve tried to elicit their opinion, usually).  If I don&#39;t have an<br/>\nopinion (if I am conflicted myself), I&#39;ll just give the reasons for my<br/>\nconflict--the points I feel are important on both sides of the issue.  I<br/>\nwant them to learn to think critically. I think if they can do this, they<br/>\n*will* make good judgments in their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter go--too nice a day here in Oklahoma to sit at the computer!<br/>\n<br/>\n--Leslie Moyer / Oklahoma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":89240901,"authorName":"Groundhoggirl","from":"Groundhoggirl &lt;groundhoggirl@...&gt;","profile":"groundhoggirl2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] A child&#39;s view","postDate":"1011193627","msgId":31076,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMTE2MTUwNS5nMEdGNWd1MzAwNDIxNkBzbTE0LnRleGFzLnJyLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwOGMwMWMxOWU5OSQ1OTYxMDU0MCQwMjAxYThjMEBvZmZpY2U+"},"prevInTopic":31075,"nextInTopic":31077,"prevInTime":31075,"nextInTime":31077,"topicId":31074,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ============================= Wow.
