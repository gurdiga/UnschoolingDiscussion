In fact, I don&#39;t think of what Rosie is doing online with<br/>\n&gt; this math course as &quot;doing math.&quot; It is less than that - it is fun<br/>\n&gt; for her, so that&#39;s fine, but if someone (not an unschooler) was<br/>\n&gt; looking for a math curriculum this would NOT be my recommendation. Or<br/>\n&gt; at least it would be the lowest, poorest part of a math program.<br/>\n&gt; Unschoolers get the best and richest math &quot;program&quot; by living their<br/>\n&gt; lives and letting the math bubble up just like everything else<br/>\n&gt; bubbles up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kids don&#39;t NEED this - they&#39;ll learn what they need to learn. Neither<br/>\n&gt; of my other kids needed or wanted anything like this and they&#39;re FINE.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If people are thinking they don&#39;t have enough math in their<br/>\n&gt; unschooling lives - the first thing I&#39;d suggest is that you probably<br/>\n&gt; do and just don&#39;t recognize it and, second, if you want to &quot;strew&quot;<br/>\n&gt; more stuff that encourages mathematical thinking and learning,<br/>\n&gt; perhaps look at Julie Brennan&#39;s website, &lt;LivingMath.net&gt; for ideas<br/>\n&gt; that are going to be far better than a mechanical, formal math program.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The ONLY reason I brought it up was because someone asked and, yes, I<br/>\n&gt; have a daughter who, at 15, is as interested in doing formal math as<br/>\n&gt; she is in going to Disneyland or learning to play guitar or playing<br/>\n&gt; soccer. It isn&#39;t any more special to her than those other things,<br/>\n&gt; which are ALL important to her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kids who love music will gravitate toward music and, at some point,<br/>\n&gt; might very likely want a more formal way to study - lessons,<br/>\n&gt; teachers, books, plans, whatever. Roxana &quot;just sang&quot; until she got<br/>\n&gt; really serious about musical theater and then she wanted to study<br/>\n&gt; with people who could really help her progress. Rosie could stand in<br/>\n&gt; the living room and copy karate moves while watching Bruce Lee<br/>\n&gt; movies, but she wanted systematic instruction by people who knew how<br/>\n&gt; to help her. She&#39;s played guitar for a long time, but just decided to<br/>\n&gt; take some lessons recently.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kids should pursue what they are interested in pursuing and sometimes<br/>\n&gt; that includes formal methods - but I always hate to talk about a kid<br/>\n&gt; who loves things that sound like formal schooling because people jump<br/>\n&gt; all over it, thinking THAT is good for their kid, too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do not consider this math program to be any more important (in<br/>\n&gt; fact, it is LESS important if I&#39;m honest) than Rosie getting on the<br/>\n&gt; phone and putting together a group of kids to go together to<br/>\n&gt; Disneyland today - calling people, making arrangements, talking to<br/>\n&gt; their parents and leaving messages and getting back to people with<br/>\n&gt; new information and all that. THAT is a real-life important skill.<br/>\n&gt; AND it involves important mathematical thinking, too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: &lt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

Or  <br/>\nat least it would be the lowest, poorest part of a math program.  <br/>\nUnschoolers get the best and richest math &quot;program&quot; by living their  <br/>\nlives and letting the math bubble up just like everything else  <br/>\nbubbles up.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids don&#39;t NEED this - they&#39;ll learn what they need to learn.

It isn&#39;t any more special to her than those other things,  <br/>\nwhich are ALL important to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who love music will gravitate toward music and, at some point,  <br/>\nmight very likely want a more formal way to study - lessons,  <br/>\nteachers, books, plans, whatever. Roxana &quot;just sang&quot; until she got  <br/>\nreally serious about musical theater and then she wanted to study  <br/>\nwith people who could really help her progress. Rosie could stand in  <br/>\nthe living room and copy karate moves while watching Bruce Lee  <br/>\nmovies, but she wanted systematic instruction by people who knew how  <br/>\nto help her. She&#39;s played guitar for a long time, but just decided to  <br/>\ntake some lessons recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids should pursue what they are interested in pursuing and sometimes  <br/>\nthat includes formal methods - but I always hate to talk about a kid  <br/>\nwho loves things that sound like formal schooling because people jump  <br/>\nall over it, thinking THAT is good for their kid, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not consider this math program to be any more important (in  <br/>\nfact, it is LESS important if I&#39;m honest) than Rosie getting on the  <br/>\nphone and putting together a group of kids to go together to  <br/>\nDisneyland today - calling people, making arrangements, talking to  <br/>\ntheir parents and leaving messages and getting back to people with  <br/>\nnew information and all that. THAT is a real-life important skill.  <br/>\nAND it involves important mathematical thinking, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] What do your kids do?","postDate":"1139242482","msgId":111780,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMjA2MTYxNDQyLjQ2MjA2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxMTA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFBNDMzNzNFLTMwQUMtNEJBMC05ODA1LTZFNjg4Nzk1NEE1QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":111779,"nextInTopic":111782,"prevInTime":111779,"nextInTime":111781,"topicId":111736,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***It does kind of miss the point, but on the other hand it IS the point!*** lol,  exactly.  :)    And I think that s why its so hard to explain too.

She sometimes<br/>\n&gt;&gt; watches French movies, in French, or in English with French<br/>\n&gt;&gt; subtitles. She has dabbled like this for years - picked up a lot. A<br/>\n&gt;&gt; few weeks ago she bought a Harry Potter book - in Latin - just for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the fun of working some of it out.  In college, she took a French<br/>\n&gt;&gt; class and did really well and loved it.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; My point in telling these things is that, yes, there are kids who<br/>\n&gt;&gt; will pursue these &quot;subjects&quot; for fun. But not all kids will do this -<br/>\n&gt;&gt; my other kids have no interest in foreign language, for example. Rox<br/>\n&gt;&gt; isn&#39;t really very interested in algebra or geometry (in a formal<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sense) but has chosen to study them because she has a greater goal<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that requires it.

There is no reason they <br/>\nhave to learn it before they are 17 (or 18 or 62...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was concerned that if they change <br/>\n&gt; their minds about college we will hedge them in, do you know what <br/>\n&gt;I <br/>\n&gt; mean? The 13 year old would like to learn programming, and that <br/>\n&gt; takes advanced math--but he doesn&#39;t have the motivation to bother <br/>\n&gt;to <br/>\n&gt; learn it on his own. He just figures &quot;I don&#39;t know that kind of <br/>\n&gt; math, so I can&#39;t learn programming&quot;, rather than the goal being <br/>\n&gt; enough for him to buckle down and learn it on his own. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>FYI as one who has worked in high tech software companies since <br/>\n1990, it does NOT take advanced mathematics to understand <br/>\nprogramming. It takes orderly thinking (this first, then this) and <br/>\ncreativity (both of which abound in video game players). It&#39;s like <br/>\ncreating a recipe almost. My DH learned to design websites (HTML <br/>\nprogramming) with just barely a high school diploma (that is, he got <br/>\nby enough to keep the school off his back but didn&#39;t really learn <br/>\nanything there - he learned by programming on an old TRS-80 era type <br/>\ncomputer). Again, your job is to facilitate. So, go out to Borders <br/>\nor B&N and find some Intro to programming books. Visual Basic is <br/>\npretty simple (and is one of the Intro classes one would take in <br/>\nhigh school or college anyhow). Java programming can get you a job <br/>\nwithout a college degree. Get a Lego Mindstorms set to play with. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are your kids motivated enough to teach themselves what they need <br/>\n&gt;to <br/>\n&gt; know to acheive their goals?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Were your kids motivated enough to handle repeated falls to finally <br/>\nwalk across the living room? Were your kids motivated enough to <br/>\nrepeat &#39;mik, mik, mik&#39; enough times until you &#39;got it&#39; and gave them <br/>\nmilk...and maybe said &#39;Here&#39;s your milk&#39; and next time it got a <br/>\nlittle closer to &#39;milk&#39; than &#39;mik&#39; because it got them to their goal <br/>\nsooner.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it really sounds like is that -you- are worried because you see <br/>\nlearning as something that ends at age 17 or 18 and then life <br/>\nhappens and you have to have everything you need packed in before 18 <br/>\nor you&#39;ll never be able to do anything. Try telling that to my DH <br/>\nwho went to college at 27 because he hated school so much he vowed <br/>\nnever to set foot in a classroom again when he graduated high <br/>\nschool. Then he found something HE wanted to do, applied, and took <br/>\nall the CLEP exams (college level exam for placement - they have <br/>\nthem in math, science, arts, history, etc - pretty much all areas) <br/>\nand tested out of 1 1/2 semesters of intro coursework - he said the <br/>\ntests were like playing Jeopardy! Very little was related to stuff <br/>\nhe learned in school, except insofar as there was reading and basic <br/>\nmath involved (and you already said your kids have that covered <br/>\nanyhow).<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] What do your kids do?","postDate":"1139241741","msgId":111777,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFBNDMzNzNFLTMwQUMtNEJBMC05ODA1LTZFNjg4Nzk1NEE1QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwMjA2MTUxNzI4Ljc3MTcucW1haWxAd2ViNTExMDkubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwMjA2MTUxNzI4Ljc3MTcucW1haWxAd2ViNTExMDkubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":111775,"nextInTopic":111778,"prevInTime":111776,"nextInTime":111778,"topicId":111736,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ====================== It does kind of miss the point, but on the other hand it IS the point!

I&#39;ve never used my algebra since leaving school.  I guess i&#39;ve figured out things I need when I need them,, kind of algebra, figuring out X.  But my kids do that all the time and they&#39;ve never been taught it.  I wouldn&#39;t worry about that.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  But as for foreign language, my daughter loves languages. She&#39;s wanted to learn different ones for years and she&#39;s only 11.  We&#39;ve drawn Chinese characters, Japanese, read Spanish, French, Norwegian, and elvish.  :D    Now, we aren&#39;t fluent in any of those,, yet.  But I know if she wants to, it will happen.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Her language interests also get nurtured within gaming, ah huh!   In our new game we&#39;re playing, WOW, (world of warcraft) there are different races with different languages. :D  So, she now is trying to decypher those different languages that she can&#39;t speak.  We are currently trying to find an ad-on so we can communicate with the different races and just last night she went through our alphabet to me (on another computer) in a different language to see how the whole thing corresponded with English. &lt;g&gt;   I never thought of doing that.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Kelli~<br/>\n   <br/>\n     <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

The point of understanding unschooling.  You have to see that a person will learn what that person needs to learn.  And as a parent to an unschooler we have to be ok with what our children want to do.  Once you can be ok with that a whole new world will open for you.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Back to my first comment, &quot;don&#39;t let them do it on their own&quot;  this is where the gaming can just go and go and go.  :D<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Help them to see more about what they like in the game.  One example of my son going on a tangent with gaming is his playing Final Fantasy XI.  Final Fantasy XI is a MMORP (massively multiplayer online role playing) game.  He played that game for months, and tons of challenges and fun in it. One of his tangents was learning about Samurais.  He had to level a character to a high level and then he could unlock Samurai.  He loved it.  I thought maybe he&#39;d like to learn more about samurais so we borrowed The Last Samurai,  he loved it.  Watched it 2 or 3 times, watched all the extras. <br/>\n   <br/>\n   We then got the mini series Shogun.  I thought he might like it.  He wasn&#39;t sure at first because he didn&#39;t like the way it looked.  It looked &quot;old&quot; to him.  It is dated, but we gave it a try.  After the first segment he was hooked as was I, trying to remember it from my childhood &lt;g&gt;.  We got them all from Netflix.  It was great.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  He also was online quite a bit looking up things about them--he especially likes armor and weaponry.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Now, zoom ahead to this past Christmas, 6 months later, and we&#39;re having a dinner with my in-laws and a neighbor(who is an English professor)  We&#39;re all talking and find out that our neighbor spent a few years in Japan researching their history.  Cool,,, my son starts asking him about samurai, we start talking about the movie and tv show.   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My neighbor can&#39;t believe how much he knows about Japan and these ancient warriors.   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  All from gaming,,,, well and all that it leads to...<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My kids are living such a happy life and the learning is sooo happening.  The math happens, the reading happens,  it really DOES happen.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Kelli Traaseth = gaming mom :D<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

I&#39;m ok with unschooling these years because I think you DO get <br/>\nenough practice in these areas just by living life.<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh school subjects were really useless to me,personally. I never <br/>\nused anything that I learned in school past the 6th grade. But...I <br/>\nchose to not go to college and stay home with my family. Aren&#39;t high <br/>\nschool subjects necessary for college? Aren&#39;t they necessary for <br/>\nsome jobs? One of my children wants to be a veterinarian--won&#39;t she <br/>\nhave to study some advanced math to acheive that goal? Right now, <br/>\nthe other two have no desire for college (they are 12 and 13), but <br/>\nwhat if they change their minds and find that they can&#39;t go to <br/>\ncollege because they never learned algebra or geometry?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried unschooling for several years, we just didn&#39;t do school. <br/>\nThey didn&#39;t get into anything but gaming. They didn&#39;t &quot;dabble in <br/>\nalot of things&quot;. or pursue any interests other than gaming related <br/>\nactivities. They seem to have learned everything they needed to know <br/>\nup to this point from this but I was concerned that if they change <br/>\ntheir minds about college we will hedge them in, do you know what I <br/>\nmean? The 13 year old would like to learn programming, and that <br/>\ntakes advanced math--but he doesn&#39;t have the motivation to bother to <br/>\nlearn it on his own. He just figures &quot;I don&#39;t know that kind of <br/>\nmath, so I can&#39;t learn programming&quot;, rather than the goal being <br/>\nenough for him to buckle down and learn it on his own. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre your kids motivated enough to teach themselves what they need to <br/>\nknow to acheive their goals?<br/>\n<br/>\nErin<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ren Allen&quot; <br/>\n&lt;starsuncloud@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I guess what I&#39;m trying to get at is does it take a certain KIND <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; kid to unschool successfully?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No, it takes a certain kind of parent to unschool successfully.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &quot;The type to find a topic and really<br/>\n&gt; get into it?
