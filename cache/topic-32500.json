I usually notice I&#39;m a<br/>\nmuch happier person and have much nicer children than<br/>\nthose who want to look down on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s often a challenge to find common ground, but<br/>\nthat&#39;s what I always try to do.  With homeschooling,<br/>\nthough -- which in my mind has and should and always<br/>\nwill be unschooling -- the only common ground is<br/>\nconcern for the child.  I&#39;ve explained myself so many<br/>\ntimes over the last 18 years that I&#39;m no longer upset<br/>\nin any way by the questions and criticisms.  Of course<br/>\nthere are things about myself I wouldn&#39;t share with<br/>\nhardly anyone, but keeping my kids out of school is<br/>\none of the defining characteristics of my lifestyle,<br/>\nso I do talk about it. No one who gets to know my<br/>\ndaughters can point to any lack, but of course some<br/>\npeople like to think their way would have been better.<br/>\n Sometimes I let those very people contribute.  For<br/>\nexample, one concerned individual introduced us to a<br/>\nzoo curator, who gave us a personal tour and lecture<br/>\nof his insectarium, including the back rooms.  That&#39;s<br/>\nwhen we held a tarantula and a &quot;walking leaf&quot; and<br/>\npetted a Hercules beetle. I will always remember that<br/>\nas MY best zoo trip.  <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
