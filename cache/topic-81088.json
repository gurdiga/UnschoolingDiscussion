She says, in a very disgusted tone of <br/>\nvoice, &quot;oh, now I must do my homework.&quot;  I don&#39;t say anything and she <br/>\ncontinues &quot;I have to read four chapters in this book, before I go to <br/>\nsleep, four whole chapters.&quot;  I kinda &quot;hmmm&quot; to her and she goes on with <br/>\nthis crabbing about her homework until I&#39;m about to crack up.  Finally I <br/>\ncan&#39;t take it any longer, and I fall for her trap.  &quot;Homework, Lexie, <br/>\nwho has given you homework?&quot;  She sighs heavily and says &quot;my teacher.&quot;  <br/>\nI laugh and say &quot;your teacher?  What do you mean your teacher.&quot;   She <br/>\ncracks up and says &quot;Yes, ME!  I&#39;m my teacher and I gave myself homework <br/>\nbut now I&#39;ve decided I don&#39;t have to do it anymore!
