A lot of our Homeopathic Materia Medica comes from the toxic effects of substances that have been abused<br/>\nbecause of the claims they advertise them with. Every woman is different, and so are her PMS symptoms. We don&#39;t all fit into this &quot;mold&quot; of lacking calcium.<br/>\nIt&#39;s again, just marketing to sell &quot;natural&quot; products.<br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m past the point of  PMS in my life, but I&#39;m up for living to one hundred<br/>\n&gt; years old!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; CORAL CALCIUM!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wow!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, we all know now about osteoporosis and bone<br/>\n&gt; support, blood vessels and circulation, teeth and<br/>\n&gt; how important good quality calcium is for dealing<br/>\n&gt; with the above and more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I did not know that research says it might help<br/>\n&gt; with such things as colon cancer and prolong your<br/>\n&gt; life in general! That just BLEW ME AWAY!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This whole Coral Calcium thing is IMPORTANT for<br/>\n&gt; every single woman on the planet. But, of course,<br/>\n&gt; you already know that without me, right? :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, please, read the following article and share<br/>\n&gt; it with everyone you care about or who you know has<br/>\n&gt; any of the mentioned conditions and could profit<br/>\n&gt; from the below information.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Enjoy! And let me know what you think, please.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With Love,<br/>\n&gt; Barda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S.: For those of you who are interested in getting<br/>\n&gt; some Coral Calcium of truly superior quality and at<br/>\n&gt; an incredibly low price (that was discovered during<br/>\n&gt; long and detailed search by your obedient servant :-),<br/>\n&gt; there is a link and a code for you at the end of this<br/>\n&gt; e-mail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Once again, Enjoy!

Life tables calculated from<br/>\n&gt; this database show one of the world&#39;s highest<br/>\n&gt; concentrations of centenarians and likely the<br/>\n&gt; world&#39;s longest life expectancy for any country or<br/>\n&gt; state.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After examining over six hundred Okinawan<br/>\n&gt; centenarians and numerous &#39;youngsters&#39; in their<br/>\n&gt; seventies, eighties, and nineties, the researchers<br/>\n&gt; saw certain patterns begin to emerge. It became<br/>\n&gt; clear that the Okinawan lifestyle was providing<br/>\n&gt; some real, scientifically verifiable reasons these<br/>\n&gt; people were so incredibly healthy so far into their<br/>\n&gt; senior years. And they were reasons that could<br/>\n&gt; have a profound impact on our health and well-<br/>\n&gt; being here in the West.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Among the reasons for their longevity of life and<br/>\n&gt; overall health cited by the study was &#39;the high<br/>\n&gt; calcium intake by Okinawans in both food and<br/>\n&gt; their natural drinking water.&#39; The coral calcium in<br/>\n&gt; their water has played a key role.<br/>\n&gt; _________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is right in line with numerous studies that are<br/>\n&gt; beginning to point to the significant benefits of<br/>\n&gt; calcium. In the October 13, 1998 issue of the New<br/>\n&gt; York Times wrote an article appeared entitled<br/>\n&gt; &#39;Calcium Takes Its Place As a Superstar of<br/>\n&gt; Nutrients&#39; in which it reports that a study<br/>\n&gt; published in the Journal of the American Medical<br/>\n&gt; Association reported that &#39;increasing calcium<br/>\n&gt; induced normal development of the epithelia cells<br/>\n&gt; and might also prevent cancer in such organs as the<br/>\n&gt; breast, prostate and pancreas&#39;. It also reported that<br/>\n&gt; the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition published<br/>\n&gt; &#39;virtually no major organ system escapes calcium&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; influence&#39; and that a research team from the<br/>\n&gt; University of Southern California found &#39;adding<br/>\n&gt; calcium to the diet lowered the blood pressure in<br/>\n&gt; 110 black teenagers.&#39;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The January 14, 1999 issue of the Phoenix Republic<br/>\n&gt; wrote an article about cancer entitled &#39;Calcium<br/>\n&gt; Reduces Tumors&#39; that the New England Journal of<br/>\n&gt; Medicine reported &#39;adding calcium to the diet can<br/>\n&gt; keep you from getting tumors in your large<br/>\n&gt; intestine&#39;. Then the February, 1999 issue of the<br/>\n&gt; Readers Digest wrote in an article entitled &#39;The<br/>\n&gt; &#39;Superstar Nutrient&#39; that the Journal of the<br/>\n&gt; American Medical published &#39;when the participants<br/>\n&gt; consumption reached 1500 milligrams of calcium a<br/>\n&gt; day, cell growth in the colon improved toward<br/>\n&gt; normal (this means that the cancer was reversed)&#39;.<br/>\n&gt; The Digest also reported that the Metabolic Bone<br/>\n&gt; Center at St. Lukes Hospital believes that &#39;a chronic<br/>\n&gt; deficiency of calcium is largely responsible for<br/>\n&gt; premenstrual syndrome (PMS)&#39; and that &#39;a lot of<br/>\n&gt; women are avoiding the sun and their vitamin-D<br/>\n&gt; levels may be very low.&#39;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For more, go here:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&#39;http://www.okinawaprogram.com&#39;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; http://www.okinawaprogram.com &lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; AS PROMISED:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here is the link for THE BEST ( in my and not only MY<br/>\n&gt; opinion) and most affordable Coral Calcium available:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; http://www.vitacorp.com/products/coralcalcium.asp<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; During the &#39;Check Out&#39; you&#39;ll be asked your sponsor&#39;s ID#<br/>\n&gt; Just enter 821261 and you are all set! :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And as always, I&#39;m anxious to hear about your thoughts,<br/>\n&gt; feelings and experiences.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All the best!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barda Allen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 315 State Street<br/>\n&gt; Helena, MT 59601<br/>\n&gt; 406-449-7513<br/>\n&gt; HeavensOnEarth@...<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Shipping&quot; is  My  Business -<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just got back home from my House Special at The General Mercantile.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Merc makes coffee the slow way, using a 1950&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;                                                            Italian LaPavoni<br/>\n&gt; Espresso Machine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My House Special is alot like &quot;Shipping&quot; .
