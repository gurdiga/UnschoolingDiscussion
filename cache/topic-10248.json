Correction usually has something to do with logical consequences or learnig from mistakes. Any fool can hit, it takes thought to teach right from wrong. I don&#39;t see how hitting can be applied with love. That&#39;s just an oxymoron. Especially bad on small children. How can you teach them that hitting is wrong when you&#39;re hitting them? Read, learn, keep trying, but no hitting.
