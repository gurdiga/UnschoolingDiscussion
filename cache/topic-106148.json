I&#39;m not saying there  <br/>\naren&#39;t any.  I&#39;m saying of the teens I&#39;ve seen grow up in the families I  knew when <br/>\nthey were little, when the parents were gentle attachment-parenting  types <br/>\n(with or without unschooling) or unschoolers who were doing more than just  <br/>\nsaying they were unschoolers, but whose family lives really changed, none said  &quot;I <br/>\nam out of here&quot; before they were 18, and none said it after, in that way and  <br/>\nthat tone.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOf regular-parenting, always schooled families, I know two in which the  <br/>\nparents (both times a parent and a step-parent, which may or may not be  <br/>\ncoincidental) went on and ON in advance of the kid being 18 that at 18 that kid  was on <br/>\nhis own.  One joined the air force.  One got a crummy job,  bought a crummy <br/>\ncar from a crummy relative and moved with a crummy girlfriend to  a crummy <br/>\napartment.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHere&#39;s the darndest thing about that:  the families aren&#39;t under less  <br/>\nstress, with that 18 year old boy gone.  Their rent is just as high.   Their water <br/>\nand electricity aren&#39;t cheaper.  Maybe the food&#39;s a little  cheaper.  Maybe the <br/>\nhouse is quieter.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIn another family (said &quot;homeschooling&quot; but did squat but pay for American  <br/>\nSchool and yell at the kids about it seasonally) had a girl who went to babysit <br/>\n for someone with a six year old, and basically didn&#39;t go home much from then <br/>\n on.  Her parents didn&#39;t get along, her brother was horrible, she had an  <br/>\nolder sister who got pregnant as a teen, married the boyfriend and  moved to <br/>\nEurope.  Being at the babysitting house was the best part of her  life.  She&#39;s 18 <br/>\nnow or 19, joined the national guard, and is in  Baghdad. <br/>\n <br/>\nAlthough I think any of my kids could function as adults if suddenly  <br/>\norphaned, and while I think they&#39;re already prepared to be good mates and  parents, <br/>\nI&#39;m in no hurry to shove them out and they&#39;re in no hurry to go.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen a family sets time limits and says &quot;When you&#39;re fifteen you can date&quot;  <br/>\nand &quot;When you&#39;re sixteen you can stay out after midnight&quot; and other such  <br/>\nlimitations and &quot;goals,&quot; it makes it easy (maybe inevitable) for the child to  <br/>\nthink &quot;Yeah, and when I&#39;m 18 I can bail and stop being treated as a powerless  and <br/>\nmindless child.&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nHolly&#39;s in Europe without having to wait until she was 16, or 18 (didn&#39;t  <br/>\neven have to wait for school to be out).  Kirby is across town on his own,  but <br/>\nthat&#39;s not a new privilege.  He&#39;s gone to this gaming shop 15 or 20  miles away <br/>\nwith increasingly regularity.  Marty&#39;s off camping with his dad,  but with <br/>\nhis dad and 1500 or so other people.  Keith might not see him  much, but I&#39;m not <br/>\nworried.  Marty has his own tent and will go to sleep  every single night, at <br/>\nsome point.  My big worry is sunscreen.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m rambling, but intending to try to remind new readers (and old readers  <br/>\nwith only young children &lt;g&gt;) that if choices and freedoms are common and  <br/>\nsafety and mutual friendship are common, turning  18 doesn&#39;t become a special <br/>\nthreshhold in an unschooling  household.  [For the social security administration, <br/>\nthat&#39;s quite a  different matter, and when someone&#39;s collecting <br/>\nmother-of-a-dependent-child  benefits, that and the child&#39;s check together are over $1000 a <br/>\nmonth (maybe a  fair amount more, it&#39;s been a while since I knew and I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow what all the  factors might be), and the sudden loss of that much money is <br/>\nBIGtime, and not an  arbitrary thing, and not an unexpected thing.]<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128695025,"authorName":"wifetovegman2002","from":"&quot;wifetovegman2002&quot; &lt;wifetovegman2002@...&gt;","profile":"wifetovegman2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: what is magic about 18?","postDate":"1117252332","msgId":106234,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ3OHB0YytkcTk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg2LjI4YmVlM2UxLjJmYzRjOWZkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":106152,"nextInTopic":106236,"prevInTime":106233,"nextInTime":106235,"topicId":106148,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... 18 is ... then ...
