But he&#39;s *really* good at advanced<br/>\nmath. He plays math games with his father (computer programmer) and they<br/>\nthink up math puzzles to challenge each other that make my teeth fall asleep<br/>\n(the last one involved the calculation of the diameter of a roll of toilet<br/>\npaper given some incredibly obscure variables that I can&#39;t even remember,<br/>\nmuch less calculate).

Sure, many people who are interested in<br/>\nhigher math *do* sit down with books (Wally, though it is incomprehensible<br/>\nto me &lt;g&gt;, wants to buy a bunch of math computer CDs and do the &quot;book<br/>\nlearning&quot; that he never did in school.
