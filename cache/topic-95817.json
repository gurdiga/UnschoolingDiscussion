But I <br/>\ndid get frustrated with the teachers, many of whom were likewise zombiefied and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t care.  They were going through the motions and rather than discuss math <br/>\nor history or whatever *I* thought should have been their passion, they would <br/>\nknock me out if the happy air with &quot;You don&#39;t need to know that this year&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;That won&#39;t be on the test.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were a few who WOULD talk about things.  Music teachers.

If you knew their hobby or personal passion, you might get them <br/>\ngoing for a little bit.  Mr. Clark, my New Mexico history teacher in 7th <br/>\ngrade, LOVED South America and could go on and on.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t care <br/>\nabout that.  Miss Gonzales, my 4th grade teacher, really liked  dinosaurs, and <br/>\nhistory, and she would talk &quot;off duty.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there was an undercurrent of what wasn&#39;t cool to do, and it wasn&#39;t cool <br/>\nto WANT to know more just for fun, and it wasn&#39;t cool for teachers to do more <br/>\nthan they were being paid to do.   Luckily for me, I knew how to nose out those <br/>\nwho were willing to be uncool. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Trujillo, my 6th grade teacher, had a spark in him about nature and local <br/>\ngeography.  He was a sportsman, and also just had a good memory for who was <br/>\nrelated to whom and where their grandparents lived.  Howard Gardner calls that <br/>\nkind of categorization and thinking &quot;nature intelligence.&quot;  Mr. Trujillo knew <br/>\nwhat and who things were and what they were related to and how.  That was fun <br/>\nfor me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Felix, my band teacher from 5th to 9th, was a trivia bank.  When he knew <br/>\nor cared about something he knew ALL about it.  Cuban drums.  John Phillip <br/>\nSousa.  When there was something he didn&#39;t know or care about that was fine, <br/>\nbecause when he did know he lit up.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe my memories of knowing where to find input and of knowing which <br/>\nteachers were how were because I wanted to be a teacher from the time I was six, and <br/>\nI was kind of out interviewing/apprenticing.  I noticed who was good with what <br/>\nkinds of kids.  I wish I&#39;d had the overlay of the Gardner intelligence <br/>\ntheories then.  I&#39;d&#39;ve been ahead of my time. &lt;g&gt;  And it would have helped me see <br/>\nWHY some of what I was seeing was happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching is an art.  Some are naturally good at it.  Some never click.  I <br/>\nwonder if it&#39;s the other side of the love-to-learn coin?  Or whether it&#39;s just a <br/>\nflexibility of stance that allows them to be upright when things change or <br/>\npeople are different around them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKirby&#39;s a good teacher, and he has lots of opportunity to practice, at the <br/>\nkarate dojo and the gaming shop and sometimes in the SCA, with younger kids.  He <br/>\norganized a &quot;boffer seige&quot; at Outlandish, and helped coach kids to be safe <br/>\nand efficient and work together.  Coaching, kind of, I suppose, but he designed <br/>\nthe scenario too, and persuaded adults to come and defend against his army of <br/>\n40 kids, at 9:00 in the morning. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think unschooling needs some of that in the mix.  Kids who are joyful, <br/>\nparents who are curious and hopeful and flexible.  The more the better, overall, <br/>\nand some of it creates a lot more of itself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool tells kids stuff is &quot;stupid.&quot;  Kids tell each other the subject matter <br/>\nis stupid, and the teachers are stupid.  Teachers tell kids their little <br/>\nfriends are troublemakers to say &quot;stupid,&quot; and that the kids&#39; interests are <br/>\nstupid.   And the kids can start to feel small and not trust their own judgment.

We are amazed at <br/>\nthem all, yet they don&#39;t fit even what our pictures of unschooling might look like. (So glad I <br/>\nlet go of those images - you know building science labs in the basement, publishing <br/>\nnovels at age ten and becoming musical prodigies...)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were discussing our son&#39;s love of Klingon. Noah told me he found Klingon because he <br/>\nhad clicked on the Google language preferences option. He tried out each of the <br/>\nlangauges to see how Google looked in that language. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he got to Klingon, he found it entirely fascinating and thus began what is now a six <br/>\nmonth study of the language. He&#39;s got a notebook where he translates stuff he reads and <br/>\nlast night he showed me the first printed page of his personal Klingon dictationary.  All <br/>\nfrom unlimited time on the computer...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 7 yo daughter yesterday shopped with me at Old Navy yesterday. She wanted to add up <br/>\nher purchases on the way home and said, &quot;Yippee! Homeschool math.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWe worked through the adding, then we counted backwards, then we skip counted. She <br/>\nhad the best time. And it covered in one fifteen minute conversation what she had spent <br/>\nsix months trying to learn before unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea how she learned any of the computations she does on her fingers, but she&#39;s <br/>\ndoing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 9 yo son told me about some very complicated Internet game playing for Warcraft <br/>\n(can&#39;t reproduce it here because I really have no clue about that game!)
