My daughter&#39;s room is her room. Her squiggles are her squiggles.

Any little pucker or ripple gives<br/>\nme this uncontrollable urge to grab and pull.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nWe took a similar approach with our son.  We kept the crayons, markers,<br/>\nscissors, glitter and glue up high in a closed plastic container.  He had a<br/>\nhigh chair with a large tray, that was the ONLY place he was allowed to use<br/>\nthose items.  It turned into a table and chair, so as he got older he was<br/>\nallowed to sit at the table with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly once did he ever use his crayons on the wall in his room.  He had<br/>\nscribbled on a huge wall behind his bed.  So, if we make a mess, we clean it<br/>\nup.  He and I spent the entire day in his room cleaning the wall.  He did<br/>\nmost of the work.  :)  He never made that mistake again either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who has crayon marks everywhere in his house, walls, doors,<br/>\ndressers, mirrors...literally everywhere.  He doesn&#39;t want to hinder his<br/>\nchildren&#39;s creativity.  Now that to me is unacceptable and could never be<br/>\ntolerated.  That child would learn the lesson of his life.

Not laughing at you, just at the idea <br/>\nbecause I love to peel wallpaper, and pick at other things too Sandra!<br/>\nMy parents bought a house about 10 years ago with pink flowered wallpaper in <br/>\nseveral different rooms downstairs.  My mom hates the wallpaper but had never <br/>\ndone anything about it.  She also hates the look of ripped off wallpaper, so <br/>\nlast year I started peeling the wallpaper off in tiny sections in the corner of <br/>\nrooms when I went to visit.  It started innocently enough, I swear, a corner <br/>\nwas coming off by itself and I just &quot;couldn&#39;t help myself&quot;, and peeled a <br/>\nlittle off.<br/>\nAnyways, now we&#39;ve started redoing all those rooms one at a time and it&#39;s so <br/>\nnice to be rid of the ugly wallpaper!  One room left to go, and it only has a <br/>\nborder on top with pink walls.<br/>\nBut I AM helping her to redo those rooms and she&#39;s wanted to for a long time- <br/>\nso please no one give me too hard a time about my wallpaper peeling.  Her <br/>\nhouse is looking much nicer now!<br/>\nMy kids have never peeled at it while we were there, but they are always busy <br/>\nplaying with grandma!<br/>\nAs for keeping them from coloring on the walls and what-not, my kids (4 and <br/>\n1) are welcome to use crayons and markers whenever they want, but they are not <br/>\nkept where they can get to them, so I don&#39;t have to worry too much about the <br/>\nyoungest coloring the wall when I&#39;&#39;m not around.
