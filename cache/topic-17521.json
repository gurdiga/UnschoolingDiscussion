YOu do make sense. I do not generally watch TV, but I am\nlearning to do since we pulled our son out of school a few months ago.\nIt is a way I can connect with him. He and my husband enjoy cooking as\na hobby. When he discovered the Food Channel a couple of months ago I was\nthe one who was in for an education even more than him. I have seen him\nlearn chemistry, cooking, social studies, fractions and all sorts of things\nfrom a couple of programs. Of course, we supplement this, but, it does&nbsp;\nspark his interest in lots of topics and leads to learning.\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We sure do limit TV content in this house. We have\ncertain programs that are not allowed. Those are ones that we deem too\nviolent or that contain inappropriate content. We talk about our reasons\nfor not allowing them. It leads to lots of value teaching.&nbsp; I respect\nhis right and need to watch some TV, but as a parent I have the ultimate\nresponsiblity to take charge of what he sees. We also have our share of\nacceptable videos he is allowed to watch at almost any time.\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also concerned about the advertising that occurs\nwith TV. We talk about it now that he is older. It was hard to do when\nhe was a lot younger. Our strategy was to buy videos, like Barney, Winnie\nthe Pooh and others.\n<br>I will get off my soap box.\n<br>Norma\n<br>&nbsp;\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote TYPE=\"CITE\">\n<pre>I am more concerned about limiting the &quot;content&quot;.&nbsp; TV is\nnot the same as it&nbsp;\nused to be. I am more concerned with all the advertising\nand the messages in&nbsp;\nthe shows themselves. Do any of you who do not limit &quot;TV\ntime&quot; limit &quot;TV&nbsp;\nContent&quot;?? I am babbling--hope this makes sense, I&#39;m\ntired:) Thanks so much!</pre>\n</blockquote>\n</span></blockquote></p></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17261,"nextTopicId":17486}}
