I realize this is hard to do in the case of television, unless you plain just don&#39;t own one, but with games and cd-roms, we do have more ability to offer a nice array of options, in a limited supply, so that outdoor play and face-to-face social interaction (more organic human activities), are the more available option, and I would strongly argue, the healthier option.  I do believe there is much value in the electronic world, and pleasure in the enjoyment of delicious treats, but is there a way to offer these, without the attractive packaging and addictive quality that they offer to both adults and children, the quality that marketers work hard to improve in order to persuade us to buy more!<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;m ducking my head waiting for the comments to fly! - Lynda (who thought she was &quot;unschooling&quot; until she stumbled on this group!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, February 13, 2003 2:30 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 3027<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

They are where they are and you need to be there to help them<br/>\n  get where they&#39;d like to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ask them if they want help in not destroying game controllers. How they<br/>\n  respond is going to depend on your motivations. If you are focused on<br/>\n  stopping them from destroying things, they&#39;re going to sense that your help<br/>\n  is about controlling them. If you are focused on helping them gain skills<br/>\n  that they&#39;d like to have, they&#39;ll be more open.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You could suggest that they not play unless you can be there with them.<br/>\n  (That won&#39;t work if they are sensing you want to control them.

Is that wrong????<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well I think that a good outcome to something &quot;bad&quot; doesn&#39;t justify doing<br/>\n  something bad. Lots of kids have terrible times in school and end up<br/>\n  &quot;successful&quot; and thankful that they were pushed. But it doesn&#39;t justify<br/>\n  pushing in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What does he want you to do? Ask him now while he isn&#39;t faced with going<br/>\n  somewhere he doesn&#39;t want to go. Does he want you to make him go? And ask<br/>\n  him again after you&#39;ve tried out his answer a couple of times. Ask him to<br/>\n  think about how he feels now that you pushing or not pushing. What does he<br/>\n  want you to do?

Point out the times he has really liked something after being made to<br/>\n  eat it and the times he hasn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And if he doesn&#39;t want to be urged, what difference does it make? If you had<br/>\n  very limited tastes and people kept urging you to eat stuff you didn&#39;t want<br/>\n  to, wouldn&#39;t it be annoying?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n  Message: 9<br/>\n     Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2003 08:02:39 -0500<br/>\n     From: Barb Eaton &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:homemama@...\">homemama@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  Subject: Welcome Back!<br/>\n<br/>\n    Welcome back Mary.

I have an 18 year old<br/>\n  who has been feeling very depressed. She is on med&#39;s and refuses<br/>\n  counseling. She is determined to get a highschool diploma. Nothing else<br/>\n  that has been offered suits her. I am supporting her wishes and watching<br/>\n  her struggle. I went in to her 504 meeting with her, that turned out to<br/>\n  not be a 504 meeting because the principle thought it wasn&#39;t one. This<br/>\n  principle told my daughter that there weren&#39;t any funds to help her -<br/>\n  that she (principle) has to go beg for money for the school. They always<br/>\n  say that by the way... We do have a strong ally who is assisting my<br/>\n  daughter. Without this person - who is constantly overstressed, having<br/>\n  migranes, running to the nurses office, and calling her support people -<br/>\n  my daughter would not be getting a diploma from public school. The<br/>\n  principle mentioned something like &quot;we can&#39;t have kids making up their<br/>\n  own schooling.&quot; My daughter had a suggestion on how she could best be<br/>\n  taught. I really &quot;couldn&#39;t hold it&quot; any longer and uttered &quot;heaven<br/>\n  forbid a child would have something to do with deciding how they are<br/>\n  educated.&quot; It didn&#39;t go over very well.<br/>\n  I feel very frustrated because this daughter has been feeling suicidal -<br/>\n  school knows and she is getting help - has been on a 504 for depression<br/>\n  for atleast 3 years, etc. School is about money, I know...<br/>\n  I wanted to come home and bathe in unschooling territory. For some<br/>\n  reason the older kids now 20 and 21 keep pestering me about &quot;teaching.&quot;<br/>\n  I feel obligated to explain to them once again what is happening as far<br/>\n  as unteaching their younger siblings goes. My 21 year old was very upset<br/>\n  about thinking the 12 year old should be writing essays to prepare for<br/>\n  college. I get so frustrated I don&#39;t know what to say. I told her that<br/>\n  if the 12 year old decides to go to a school/college he will be ready<br/>\n  because it will be his choice, he will be prepared, etc. She then<br/>\n  screamed at me. She said I don&#39;t know how to talk to people. I mentioned<br/>\n  the fact that he is 12 and has a while to decide about any form of<br/>\n  higher education he chooses. She said that is not enough structure. I<br/>\n  tried to explain that she is correct. There isn&#39;t a lot of structure in<br/>\n  the way I am unteaching. I write down everything they do - which is alot<br/>\n  - every day. I personally think they are learning more than ever<br/>\n  especially my now 15 year old who has been labeled dyslexic and bipolar.<br/>\n  They are right though, it doesn&#39;t look anything like public school and I<br/>\n  for one am very grateful for that.

I think<br/>\n  it is important to remember that often these kids are spending so much<br/>\n  energy protecting themselves from perceived threats (like &quot;I love you and<br/>\n  want you to be part of the family&quot;) that they don&#39;t have the energy left to<br/>\n  learn new behaviors.  I believe that stressing kids to &quot;improve&quot; before they<br/>\n  feel safe and have developed a bond is a recipe for disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Marsie came to us at 1 day of age.  Her bio mother is retarded and<br/>\n  psychotic.  Her bio father is &quot;slow&quot; and abusive.  2 siblings had lived in<br/>\n  our home previously, both were retarded with attachment problems and one was<br/>\n  psychotic.  At ages 2 and 3, these kids had to be placed in special<br/>\n  therapeutic residences because they were so destructive and out of control<br/>\n  (sleeping only a couple of hours per night, attacking other kids without any<br/>\n  known provocation, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\n  At 5 months of age, Marsie still couldn&#39;t turn over and just seemed somewhat<br/>\n  &quot;behind&quot;.  I took her to an &quot;occupational&quot; therapist who gave me the best<br/>\n  advice I&#39;ve ever been given.  She said &quot;Don&#39;t worry about dirt or germs with<br/>\n  this kid.  Let her do what she needs to do to learn.&quot;  So Marsie grew older<br/>\n  with ready access to anything she wanted, even the kitchen garbage (we just<br/>\n  washed her good when she was through), even fire ants (she can pick them up<br/>\n  and let them crawl all over her and never gets bit).  Marsie is now 6yo and<br/>\n  just smart as a whip.  She is learning to read off and on and has been<br/>\n  playing with multiplication stuff the last couple of days.  She does have a<br/>\n  temper but rarely completely loses it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She is so far past where her siblings were at her age.  I truly believe it<br/>\n  is because she felt safe and accepted.  So as a foster mom, adoptive mom,<br/>\n  unschooling mom and Master&#39;s level therapist, I would advise that you work<br/>\n  only on your relationship with your son.  Do nothing, absolutely nothing,<br/>\n  that will damage it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Julie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n  Message: 16<br/>\n     Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2003 18:45:24 -0000<br/>\n     From: &quot;AnneO &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ohman@...\">ohman@...</a>&gt;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ohman@...\">ohman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  Subject: Special needs article<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve had the most wonderful and overwhelming requests for my <br/>\n  article...It&#39;s amazing to me how many people can relate to <br/>\n  unschooling a unique, quirky, out-of-sync child.

My 21 year old was very upset<br/>\n  &gt; about thinking the 12 year old should be writing essays to prepare for<br/>\n  &gt; college. I get so frustrated I don&#39;t know what to say. I told her that<br/>\n  &gt; if the 12 year old decides to go to a school/college he will be ready<br/>\n  &gt; because it will be his choice, he will be prepared, etc. She then<br/>\n  &gt; screamed at me. She said I don&#39;t know how to talk to people. I mentioned<br/>\n  &gt; the fact that he is 12 and has a while to decide about any form of<br/>\n  &gt; higher education he chooses. She said that is not enough structure. I<br/>\n  &gt; tried to explain that she is correct. There isn&#39;t a lot of structure in<br/>\n  &gt; the way I am unteaching. I write down everything they do - which is alot<br/>\n  &gt; - every day. I personally think they are learning more than ever<br/>\n  &gt; especially my now 15 year old who has been labeled dyslexic and bipolar.<br/>\n  &gt; They are right though, it doesn&#39;t look anything like public school and I<br/>\n  &gt; for one am very grateful for that. Michele<br/>\n<br/>\n  Are these older kids half-siblings?  Did they go to school?  I&#39;m wondering<br/>\n  if they&#39;re really jealous without realizing it.  They could be covering up<br/>\n  their jealousy by focusing on their &quot;concerns&quot;.  You can tell them why<br/>\n  you&#39;re doing things the way you are with the younger ones, but you may just<br/>\n  have to pull the, &quot;I&#39;m the parent.  When you have kids you can raise them<br/>\n  the way you think is best.

Those things that make them SHINE.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  In Carol Stock Kranowitz&#39;s book *The Out of Sync Child,* she says <br/>\n  something like, &quot;Even the best-loved child in the world will feel <br/>\n  unloved.&quot;  I know what she&#39;s talking about.  It was my life.  It&#39;s my <br/>\n  son&#39;s life.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes, they feel like many things are against them.  How you handle <br/>\n  that is key.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is imperative that you don&#39;t just write it off.  It is important <br/>\n  to acknowledge how he feels.  How frustrated he is.  And, yes, how <br/>\n  difficult life can be for him at times.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But then it&#39;s important to move on.  Don&#39;t dwell on the negative.  Go <br/>\n  on to something where he can SHINE.<br/>\n<br/>\n  WHen my son is totally frustrated, I&#39;ll hug him and say, &quot;It&#39;s a <br/>\n  difficult job to be Jake, isn&#39;t it?&quot;  He&#39;ll collapse in my arms and <br/>\n  cry.  And then I&#39;ll let him know that I think he&#39;s wonderful, and I <br/>\n  think he&#39;s doing a great job at being Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And then we move on to those things that make him Jake.  We&#39;ll talk <br/>\n  about his comic strips that he draws, or his monsters.  We&#39;ll talk <br/>\n  about his video games, or the book he&#39;s reading.  Or we&#39;ll curl up <br/>\n  together and read a book or watch a movie.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There is a lot of stress and anxiety in these children&#39;s lives.  Do <br/>\n  what you can to move away from that and move towards the Joy and the <br/>\n  Love and the Strengths.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There is no need to push anything new.  Let him stay where he is <br/>\n  comfortable.  Go to his world, in his place of comfort.  Meet him <br/>\n  there and get to know him there.  Let him enlighten your world and <br/>\n  let him know that his unique perspective on life enlightens your own <br/>\n  life.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Time helps, also.  My son would try to draw a couple of years ago, <br/>\n  and get so frustrated and cry.  A friend of mine told me the same <br/>\n  story about her 5 year old son.  He would draw something and take it <br/>\n  to her and angrily say, &quot;Would you just throw this away because I <br/>\n  HATE IT!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s what I said:  their vision does not match their physical <br/>\n  capabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My son stopped drawing and began working with clay (Sculpey).  He was <br/>\n  AMAZING with it.  He made Pokemon after Pokemon with it, and they <br/>\n  were WONDERFUL.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This helped his confidence, and his motor skills.  After awhile, he <br/>\n  tried drawing again, and was better at it.  So he kept drawing.  Now <br/>\n  he&#39;s a wonderful artist and creates his own comic strips.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think most parents approach a frustrated child in the wrong <br/>\n  manner.  They always try to fix what went wrong.  That&#39;s not what the <br/>\n  child wants ~ especially these perfectionist children.  They want to <br/>\n  fix it themselves.  And right now, they just want to be frustrated <br/>\n  with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  They are learning.  They are learning about the world.  They are <br/>\n  learning about themselves.  They are learning how to handle having <br/>\n  video games in their home.  They are learning how to handle <br/>\n  frustration and challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\n  How YOU handle it and approach it will be their *teacher.*  <br/>\n<br/>\n  ~ Anne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n  Message: 21<br/>\n     Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2003 11:04:37 -0800<br/>\n     From: Pam Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  Subject: Re: helping with household stuff<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kathy - I like the way this kind of stuff is talked about in the &quot;How <br/>\n  to Talk so Kids will Listen and....&quot; books.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not much of a housekeeper (understatement of the year) and my kids <br/>\n  don&#39;t get asked to do much, since I&#39;m not doing much either. But - if <br/>\n  they are walking through the living room to get clean laundry off the <br/>\n  floor, wearing a wet towel from their shower, and if they drop the wet <br/>\n  towel on the couch and put on their clean clothes right there - I will <br/>\n  say: &quot;Wet towel?&quot; and they&#39;ll pick it up and hang it up.

OK, I guess the answer is that we have to be<br/>\n  &gt; willing to deal with a NO from them. And then they may<br/>\n  &gt; have to deal with certain consequences like their<br/>\n  &gt; laundry doesnt get done or whatever. Am I on the right<br/>\n  &gt; track?<br/>\n  &gt;  I dont really understand how a child in a family is<br/>\n  &gt; not already on the team just by virtue of the fact<br/>\n  &gt; that he/she is a part of the family. ( I believe that<br/>\n  &gt; we all choose very purposefully where to<br/>\n  &gt; incarnate--not that &quot;they did not ask to be born and<br/>\n  &gt; therfore they are not responsible&quot;--like they are<br/>\n  &gt; innocent bystanders or something). Are you saying that<br/>\n  &gt; if they want to eat in their room and dont want to<br/>\n  &gt; pick up the fallen food and then there is a big ant<br/>\n  &gt; infestation that they dont need to take responsibility<br/>\n  &gt; for that? I dont think thats what you mean. I did read<br/>\n  &gt; some of Sandras stuff in the archives related to this.<br/>\n  &gt; That it all depends on whats going on in the family<br/>\n  &gt; etc, who has the time and energy to help clean up the<br/>\n  &gt; mess. We dont want to trash our kids for the sake of<br/>\n  &gt; an ant infestation. I love that point she made. I&#39;m<br/>\n  &gt; just talking about teaching responsibility for ones<br/>\n  &gt; actions. I dont think its a given that the parents are<br/>\n  &gt; responsible for everything. Probably nature will take<br/>\n  &gt; its course in these instances, over time, as it does<br/>\n  &gt; everwhere and the kids will strive to be responsible<br/>\n  &gt; -&quot;because that is their nature&quot;.<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; Anyway, thanks.<br/>\n  &gt;   Kathy<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n  &gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n  &gt; Yahoo!

I think it&#39;s in June.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you e-mail me, I&#39;ll send you the info as soon as I have it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The important thing to remember about unschooling math is that it&#39;s <br/>\n  not doing nothing.  Sometimes it&#39;s thinking out loud, talking out <br/>\n  loud, figuring out answsers yourself out loud.  It&#39;s conversations <br/>\n  about patterns, numbers.  It&#39;s doing puzzles, computer games, <br/>\n  blocks.  It&#39;s weighing produce at the grocery store and calculating <br/>\n  the cost.  It&#39;s saving for something you love, figuring tax, also.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ll always remember when my son came to me and told me he had thirty-<br/>\n  some dollars and some cents.  I went into his room and looked at his <br/>\n  bed...he had piles of coins all over it.  I never sat down with him <br/>\n  and told him the value of the coins.  He learned from using them.  He <br/>\n  learned from gumball machines (well, they&#39;re not gumballs anymore, <br/>\n  and they&#39;re not a penny anymore either!)!  He learned from using.  <br/>\n  From living.  And he poured out his bank and counted all his coins <br/>\n  because he wanted to know if he had enough money for something he <br/>\n  wanted to buy. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Think of unschooling math in those terms, and compare that in your <br/>\n  mind to schooling math.  Which would REALLY inspire true learning in <br/>\n  your child?  Sitting down to a worksheet with numbers?  Or real life <br/>\n  situations where the child has a need and desire to find an <br/>\n  answer...usually associated with something joyful.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~ Anne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n  Message: 23<br/>\n     Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2003 14:21:01 EST<br/>\n     From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: re:Waldorf Toys<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 2/13/03 5:45:01 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jana@...\">jana@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; This is horrible!

They were brainwashed and it will take time to be unbrainwashed. We<br/>\nnow have a foster child who goes to a specialized school. I am not sure<br/>\nwhy because we haven&#39;t been told much yet. He has been here for a week.<br/>\nHe is on heavy med&#39;s though for ADHD and to sleep at night. He keeps<br/>\nbusy every moment with projects; painting, building with anything he can<br/>\nfind, playing nintendo, reading, etc. He has himself on his own<br/>\nschedule. I&#39;m here for backup:) He&#39;s 10. Our youngest is 12 going on 20.<br/>\nSo far so good. My kids really like the new Sims Park and learning about<br/>\neconomy, animals, etc. that way.They stay on for hours. I haven&#39;t been<br/>\non it yet. We also talk constantly about what ever interests us so they<br/>\nlearn a lot that way, too. We just finished a project on Two Towers that<br/>\nthey liked. We are very unstructured here. We eat when we feel like it.<br/>\nMy eldest daughter and her fiance who don&#39;t live with us are on Weight<br/>\nWatchers. Since my 12 year old goes there every week just about, he has<br/>\nbeen learning about that. He is going with the flow of not eating tons<br/>\nof candy. It has been his choice. My 14 year old has decided to quit<br/>\ntherapy after 4 years. It is a little scary yet, he seems much more<br/>\nbalanced lately. He has taken up cigerette smoking:( He got a ticket<br/>\nlast week and the police called me at 9:30 at night to tell me they had<br/>\ntalked to him. It is illegal to smoke in public under 18 here. I learned<br/>\nsomething. I was glad he wasn&#39;t calling to tell me my son was arrested<br/>\nor worse. I was still snippy with the officer which I do and then punish<br/>\nmyself for. I wish I wasn&#39;t such a b-word sometimes. At least it was one<br/>\nof the nicer officers. My son has bipolar and has done a great job<br/>\nlearning how to express himself in healthier ways. Alot of this happened<br/>\nafter he was out of public school. He has friends that smoke cigerettes<br/>\nand stay away from the stronger stuff. I admit I am not full of joy to<br/>\nbe going through the teen years again for the umteenth time. I am not<br/>\nsuper strict. I figure that they know a lot already and this is their<br/>\nexperience. We talk all the time about everything except what they don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to tell me:) My 14 year old tells me he feels guilty and telling me<br/>\nstuff relieves his anxiety. I usually let them know they aren&#39;t really<br/>\ndoing anything others haven&#39;t done and guide them to be safe. Anyone who<br/>\nhas kids knows kids do what they feel like doing, especially teens. I am<br/>\nhappy he feels he can talk to me or one of his siblings. We are a close<br/>\nfamily. I am proud of that. We are givers and not so good at receiving.<br/>\nWe are working on that now. I&#39;ve rambled on long enough:) Michele  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58615,"nextTopicId":58624}}
