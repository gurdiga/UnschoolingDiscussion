Shake and mix to<br/>\ndissolve and add 1-2 cups of this mixture to your wash load (white or<br/>\ncolors) and you will have soft water and lots of wonderful suds. I tried it<br/>\nyesterday with a load of whites and they really came out white. I was so<br/>\nimpressed.<br/>\nJust thought I&#39;d share my success. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68420,"nextTopicId":68433}}
