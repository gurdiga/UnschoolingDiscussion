If a sense of community <br/>\ndevelops, that&#39;s a bonus.  It can&#39;t be induced or forced.  It is possible to <br/>\npoint out when people are compromising the chance of a sense of community <br/>\n(and I might have this pointed out to me after this post, I know).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for me, the two are nowhere near to equal in importance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve known some unschooling families who never went to any homeschooling <br/>\ngroups, didn&#39;t join any organizations whatsoever, don&#39;t go to playgroups or <br/>\npark days and don&#39;t subscribe to magazines.   Having discovered what <br/>\nunschooling could be, they went out on their own without need for or desire <br/>\nfor a community of unschoolers, because they were in the community of the <br/>\nreal world, and had enough confidence to live there without &quot;support.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere must be a million--literally a thousand thousand--places to go for <br/>\nhomeschooling information, good or bad.  Local groups, newsletters, family <br/>\nwebsites, sermons posted on the web, scheduled presentations of curriculum <br/>\nsellers to local homeschooling groups, conferences, workshops, newspaper <br/>\narticles, library resource folders, and there are Christian homeschooling <br/>\nconference which can draw 5000 or more people at once.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe resources for unschoolers are very much slimmer and more limited, but <br/>\nthis list has been and can be a great source.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not my favorite, but it does have the potential to change lives for the <br/>\nbetter.  It has the potential to empower families to empower themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeekers don&#39;t need community as much as they need clarity and input.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen anyone is learning anything, there are better sources and worse ones.  <br/>\nNot every book on the Civil War is easy to understand and balanced.  Not <br/>\nevery report of the holocaust is written by someone who really knows what <br/>\nhe&#39;s talking about and has something new and thoughtful to say about it.  Not <br/>\nall sets of directions can be followed successfully.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless of all other factors, it would be good for newcomers to this or <br/>\nany list to remember that some of the people who are offering opinions are <br/>\nnot, themselves, taking their own advice.  Not all people who say &quot;I&#39;ve been <br/>\nunschooling for ten years&quot; would be considered to have been unschooling by <br/>\nother observers.  Or they might be counting from conception instead of from <br/>\nschool age (a debate we know well &lt;g&gt;).  Some who say &quot;unschooling has always <br/>\nworked perfectly for our family&quot; have had kids in and out of school (not a <br/>\ngreat sin, but a factor to be considered).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd above all, nobody needs to depend on one source for all information.--not <br/>\none person, list, company, government summary, policy, nothing.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe way adults can learn is the way children can learn--by exposure, thought, <br/>\npractice, more exposure, practice, new input, time to think, another pass at <br/>\nthe first exposure, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne bad way to learn is to come and get one set of directions, go away and <br/>\nfollow them, and declare it all learned and over with.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwork that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t learn to write a bicycle in the absence of a bicycle, and you can&#39;t <br/>\nlearn what unschooling is or how it works without actually trying it, doing <br/>\nit, getting feedback (from any and all involved), thinking, adjusting, and <br/>\nliving with it in your life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when you (anyone here or anywhere, newcomer, repeat-seeker, first or <br/>\nsecond year, convert from Calvert, longterm unschooler) read ideas and <br/>\nexperiences, let them settle.  Let them soak in.  Try some out.  Before you <br/>\ndecide with confidence that someone is your favorite writer, let some time <br/>\npass and see how the information looks in different lights.  See whether the <br/>\nwriter is consistent, and really seems concerned with helping others.  <br/>\nSynthesize your own body of knowledge from the best parts of what you gather <br/>\nby reading, observing, and experimentation. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe list can&#39;t be everything for anyone, but it can be something for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who uses it is responsible for his or her own use, and shouldn&#39;t <br/>\nattack the first day or week out.  (Thereafter you probably wouldn&#39;t want to, <br/>\nanyway.)
