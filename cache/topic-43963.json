My husband&#39;s not <br/>\ngoing to be able to go, but Liam (7) and I raring to anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough the price of the conference itself is extremely reasonable, the <br/>\nroom rates are a wee bit steep for us.  We are considering camping (which <br/>\nwould be a lot of fun, too), but it seems like there&#39;s going to be a lot of <br/>\nfun stuff going on into the night at the conference that we would like not <br/>\nto miss if we can.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith that in mind, we are wondering if anyone might be interested in <br/>\nsharing a room with us.  That would make this whole thing a lot more doable <br/>\nfor us.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, although we drive an &#39;92 Toyota Corolla (it&#39;s a great, <br/>\ncomfortable car, though), we would be delighted to offer a ride to someone <br/>\nwould like to go and needs a ride!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43952,"nextTopicId":43966}}
