That my kids never have days off<br/>\nbecause they&#39;re learning all the time. I remember reading in GWS once about<br/>\na mother who realized this when her daughter asked her an astronomy question<br/>\nat 9 pm on a July night. She thought to herself &quot;should I wait until 9 am on<br/>\na Tuesday in Oct. to answer this? Of course not&quot; I guess this was her<br/>\nlightbulb moment. I remember taking this to heart and think of it in my<br/>\ntimes of doubt.<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Natrlmama@...\">Natrlmama@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, April 15, 2000 3:22 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] What do you tell your children?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 04/12/2000 11:57:09 PM Pacific Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lturner@...\">lturner@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;  Anyway, I&#39;d love some feedback on this- what do you tell your children<br/>\n&gt;  about your homeschooling methods?   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I remember one time at the grocery store when the checker asked if my dd<br/>\n&gt; was in school and she said no we homeschool.  The checker said to dd &quot;oh<br/>\n&gt; your mom teaches you?&quot;  and dd said &quot;no my mom doesn&#39;t teach me anything&quot;<br/>\n&gt; LOL, talk about a cringing moment.  My children have never been to school,<br/>\n&gt; so they don&#39;t know that there  are different hsing methods.  What I<br/>\nexplained<br/>\n&gt; to my children how school was and what they actually did there and then<br/>\n&gt; explained to her that we learn from the world around us and from reading<br/>\n&gt; books and playiing and doing things, she really picked up on it right<br/>\naway.<br/>\n&gt; She was almost 5 at the time.  She will now tell you that you don&#39;t have<br/>\nto go<br/>\n&gt; to school to learn things, but by going places and doing things and<br/>\nexploring.<br/>\n&gt; Every evening my kids ask me if tomorrow is a day off (meaning are we<br/>\ngoing<br/>\n&gt; anywhere, be it fun/park/or just running errands).  Tonight they asked me<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; I said yes, tomorrow is but on Sunday we have a fun nature walk planned<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; some of our friends.  They were all excited and wished it were tomorrow.<br/>\n&gt; After<br/>\n&gt; a moment, my dd asks me&quot;mom, do kids who go to school get a day off on<br/>\ntheir<br/>\n&gt; birthdays?&quot;  I said &quot;no they don&#39;t&quot; and you should have seen and heard her<br/>\n&gt; expression!!  &quot;They don&#39;t ?!?!  I don&#39;t ever want to go to school!!&quot;  She<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; just incredulous!  She said do they get any days off?  I told her yes they<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; went on to explain that there are 7 days in a week and on Monday when our<br/>\n&gt; secretary is here, kids go to school every day for five days including<br/>\nFriday<br/>\n&gt; when we go to the Farmers Market, but that the next day, tomorrow ,<br/>\nSaturday,<br/>\n&gt; would be their day off and that they would have two days off together<br/>\nbefore<br/>\n&gt; they would go back to school. (I also threw in that they would have to do<br/>\n&gt; schoolwork on their days off too &lt;eg&gt;) Oh and when dad comes home from<br/>\n&gt; work and says what did you do today, they often say play, but if they<br/>\ncan&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; remember, he chimes in for them and says did you play today?!  I guess he<br/>\n&gt; sees the value in play and just being a kid too!!<br/>\n&gt; Kathy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Avoid the lines and visit avis.com for quick and easy online<br/>\n&gt; reservations.

The oldest and the youngest go to ps but the middle one is <br/>\nhomeschooled (this one is 9 yrs old).  Some days he wants me to introduce <br/>\nworksheets and school stuff to do and some days he&#39;s done in 5  minutes with <br/>\nwhatever I suggest.  I try to go with the flow (and it is hard work for me <br/>\nsometimes).  The other night we got into the discussion of the other two <br/>\nbeing in school and I don&#39;t remember exactly what was being said but he asked <br/>\nme, &quot;Is that how come you don&#39;t teach me anything?&quot;  It kind of floored me.  <br/>\nI said he is learning all the time and he just doesn&#39;t know it.  His question <br/>\nstayed with me over the days and I kept asking myself &quot;Is he learning?&quot; over <br/>\nand over.  Then I realized how much he does.  He is way more comfortable with <br/>\nreading than he ever was at school though I don&#39;t think he doesn&#39;t realizes <br/>\nit.  He goes to work with my boyfriend out on a route where he helps checks <br/>\nthings in, how to talk with customers and prices things.   He runs out with <br/>\nme on photography road trips (a hobby of mine) and I explain to him the <br/>\nbeauty I see in simple things and how contrast of colors can be so beautiful. <br/>\n He learns a lot about pet care from cleaning cages, water, feeding and trips <br/>\nto the vet.  He&#39;s my little calculator when we go grocery shopping and keep a <br/>\nrunning total to $250.    The other day he became obsessed with recycling <br/>\nwith a trip to the recycle center which also led to a great discussion on <br/>\n&quot;halfs&quot; since he got half of the money for helping me smash cans.  After I <br/>\nthought of just these few things I put my mind to rest.  So far when people <br/>\nask what he&#39;s doing home he says, &quot;I&#39;m homeschooled&quot;  but sometimes he seems <br/>\nto say it in an embarrassed way I noticed.  I guess I console myself by <br/>\nletting go and trusting (thanks my &#39;new age&#39; childhood upbringing) and by <br/>\nhoping that as an adult he&#39;ll see how much he&#39;s learned.  I wish I could give <br/>\nthis one of mine a good dose of self-confidence.  His self-esteem has risen <br/>\ngreatly since I took him out of ps last Sept but but I wish he believed <br/>\nhimself more.  I hope with more time here at home, he will.<br/>\nChelle the desert dweller</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8161,"nextTopicId":8163}}
