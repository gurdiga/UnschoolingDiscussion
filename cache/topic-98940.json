I do understand how difficult it was for the other kids.<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I feel so badly.  It was also the only idea that I had (a way to<br/>\nbreak the ice) to help my own children find someone to play with that they<br/>\nwould have a common interest with.  I can&#39;t imagine them not having<br/>\nsomething to do while I listened to all the speakers. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had read a lot of posts about Breyer horses coming to the conference with<br/>\ntheir owners, and certainly got the idea that these were slightly older<br/>\ngirls - in the 7/8/9 range - and that there were quite a lot of them with<br/>\nthis hobby. Nevertheless I suggested to Jayn (4.5) that she bring along her<br/>\nFisher Price horse and a couple of riders just in case she was able to hook<br/>\nup with some groups. That didn&#39;t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also brought along a collection of Barbies with clothes in the hope of<br/>\nfinding some girls to play with them - a maneuver that was largely<br/>\nsuccessful. At first she wanted to leave them in our room, and invite people<br/>\nto play there, (she and Ella had a great time on several occasions) but<br/>\nlater she was willing to bring the whole shebang downstairs and use them as<br/>\na lure for the like-minded. I suggested that she only bring down to the<br/>\nfoyer area those toys she was willing to share, and that worked well for<br/>\nher, and turned out to be all of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year at the conference Jayn was adopted by the lovely Heather, who I<br/>\nguess was 11 at the time. Jayn followed her around, with me in the distance,<br/>\nand Heather was very patient and kind. This year Jayn had the unfortunate<br/>\nexperience of going up to a number of different girls, older than she is but<br/>\nclearly younger than Heather had been, and asking if they wanted to play<br/>\nwith her, and being told &quot;No&quot; quite a lot, always pleasantly and sometimes<br/>\nwith a long reason why not. She was only in tears once, at the end of a long<br/>\nday, when someone had said &quot;Maybe later&quot; and Jayn decided that it was<br/>\n&quot;later&quot; and so where was the girl. She wanted to wait in the hallway all<br/>\nnight for her. Jayn will just go up to any girl and invite her to play.<br/>\nShe&#39;s like that at the park too.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn was in heaven a few times when a small group of girls, I&#39;m guessing<br/>\nabout 7 or 8 yo, I think Keira (sp?) and Hannah were in that group, kindly<br/>\ntook her around with them for a while. They kept her with them longer than I<br/>\nwould have expected. It is tough when you have a tenacious and oblivious 4yo<br/>\nthat you just can&#39;t easily ditch. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor some reason we had a hard time finding many other 4-5 yo&#39;s. Most folks<br/>\nseemed either older or younger. Luckily Jayn and Ella found each other, and<br/>\nbeing on the same floor made it even easier. Jayn is looking forward to<br/>\nsending some drawings to her. She also hooked up with Jessie from San<br/>\nFrancisco, and hopes to have an ongoing relationship with her also.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

It kind of goes hand","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2135415972\">Hi All,\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI like the whole idea Jessie shared about having an extra set of things to<br/>\nshare for - One set that is their own and one to share. It kind of goes hand<br/>\nin hand with my approach to toys and things that are important to my boys. I<br/>\ntry to as much as I can to buy things in 3&#39;s or when requesting that someone<br/>\nget Christmas presents etc. buy 3 of the same thing for all 3 of my boys.<br/>\nThat way none of them HAVE to share unless they want to. I admit this is<br/>\nharder for bigger ticket items like Nintendo etc. BUT by them having their<br/>\nown sets of things for the smaller priced items, it has made it so my boys<br/>\nfeel like they are valued and have their own special things and they have<br/>\nbeen much more willing to share with friends that way or amongst themselves<br/>\nfor the bigger ticket items as well as the smaller priced items too if they<br/>\nfeel that they are valued enough as a person to have their own things and<br/>\nnot forced to share if the do not choose to.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI do not believe in forcing my children to share either. I think that makes<br/>\nthem in the long run resentful and less willing to share as they grow and as<br/>\nthey journey into adulthood. For myself, as an adult, there are things that<br/>\nI share and there are things that I choose not to at times, and I feel that<br/>\nthis is ok and it is not meant in the context of taunting like I have<br/>\nsomething I am not gonna share ha ha kind of thing, but merely that I have<br/>\nthings that are personal just to me and that I should not be made to have to<br/>\nshare all of my things all of the time only when I wish to. Children should<br/>\nbe given the same freedom to choose whether to share or not, provided that<br/>\nit is not done in a taunting fashion. This should not be different just<br/>\nbecause they are children. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI do not feel that what you where trying to do with your kids Angie was at<br/>\nleast from what you wrote, I do not think you were or your children where<br/>\ndoing this, in a taunting manner. I can see where it may have been hard for<br/>\nthe other children who wished to also play with what your children were<br/>\nplaying with, so having a second set of the same toy if feasible is an<br/>\nexcellent option to ease this type of a situation and also to open the door<br/>\nto IF your children want to then share their set of toys, they can, or they<br/>\ncould just simply play with their set and the other children play together<br/>\nwith them with the second duplicate set.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI do feel that because of me not forcing them to share my children are much<br/>\nmore willing to share and do share. more often than not.  An example of this<br/>\njust recently was when my middle son, Matthew, who just turned 8 today, whom<br/>\neven though he had lost his new gameboy advanced sp at a homeschooling event<br/>\n still wished to give not just share but actually give as a gift of<br/>\nfriendship and love, his other older gameboy to a friend of his whom did not<br/>\nhave one, even though he knew that he would then have no gameboy.  His<br/>\ncomments to me were &quot;I want to give this to my friend because I know he does<br/>\nnot have one and even though I do not have one now, once my gameboy has been<br/>\nfound, maybe he and I will be able to play together gameboys because then we<br/>\nwill both have one!&quot;.He did this of his own volition and I was very proud of<br/>\nhim for being so loving, generous, and kind.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo, I want my kids to share because they want to, not because of me or<br/>\nsomeone else forcing them too. And this idea for an extra set of toys seems<br/>\nlike a great way to balance the idea of giving our children the choice to<br/>\nshare and also making it so that other children do not feel like they are<br/>\ntormented by not being able to play with something they wish to.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nPatti and the boys (Chris 13, Matthew 8, Anthony 6 1/2)\r<br/>\nLife Long Learning Academy\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.life-long-learning-4-all.com/index.html\">http://www.life-long-learning-4-all.com/index.html</a>\r<br/>\n&quot;For no matter where knowledge and learning come from - no matter what shape<br/>\n size, or dimension it assumes - it still is what it is,knowledge and<br/>\nlearning.

You&#39;re in Maine right? Have you heard of Pam\r<br/>\nLeo? She has a fabulous idea related to sharing at home... she has a\r<br/>\nbox of her own toys so when another child comes over, she shares the\r<br/>\ntoys in that box. It helps her granddaughter (who she&#39;s raising) to not\r<br/>\nhave to share her stuff but many times she does because she chooses to\r<br/>\nwhich I&#39;m sure feels a whole lot better than being forced!! I never\r<br/>\nfeel like a friend&#39;s child should HAVE to share with mine. I really try\r<br/>\nto bring them something of their won to play with in social\r<br/>\nsituations...\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you should worry about it!!!

I also think that kids are held to higher\r<br/>\n&gt; standards\r<br/>\n&gt;  than adults when it comes to sharing.  While an adult wouldn&#39;t\r<br/>\n&gt; generally\r<br/>\n&gt;  feel compelled to let anyone (let alone a two year old) play with\r<br/>\n&gt; their\r<br/>\n&gt;  expensive important X, children are expected to share their toys\r<br/>\n&gt; whether or\r<br/>\n&gt;  not they saved for a year to buy it or not and whether or not they\r<br/>\n&gt; know the\r<br/>\n&gt;  child or how responsible they are and whether or not they feel quite\r<br/>\n&gt; sure\r<br/>\n&gt;  that they will get back their item unharmed and whole.  I have never\r<br/>\n&gt; made my\r<br/>\n&gt;  kids share and I have always let them put away things that they don&#39;t\r<br/>\n&gt; want\r<br/>\n&gt;  to share before company arrived.  With their close friends, they share\r<br/>\n&gt;  generously and from the heart.  They know and trust these children and\r<br/>\n&gt;  sharing isn&#39;t an issue at all.\r<br/>\n&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;  Why am I writing?  Because it makes me feel bad under certain\r<br/>\n&gt; circumstances,\r<br/>\n&gt;  that&#39;s why.  At the conference my dd&#39;s brought their very special (it\r<br/>\n&gt;  usually takes them 3 months or more to save and buy one with their\r<br/>\n&gt; small\r<br/>\n&gt;  allowance, without spending it on anything else) Breyer horses.  It\r<br/>\n&gt; was my\r<br/>\n&gt;  idea.  I thought that other children who like horses might bring\r<br/>\n&gt; theirs and\r<br/>\n&gt;  they could all play together.  That worked very well with a couple of\r<br/>\n&gt;  children and they made a couple of friends that way.  They all had\r<br/>\n&gt; their\r<br/>\n&gt;  horses and they played together and shared.  They even shared with a\r<br/>\n&gt; little\r<br/>\n&gt;  girl who didn&#39;t have horses because she was respectful of them and\r<br/>\n&gt; their\r<br/>\n&gt;  stuff and they could feel that. \r<br/>\n&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;  Sadly, though, the horses were a draw to many smaller children who\r<br/>\n&gt;  continually asked to play with them.  Some children approached them\r<br/>\n&gt; and just\r<br/>\n&gt;  took their horses.  Another time a teenager who was watching a small\r<br/>\n&gt; child\r<br/>\n&gt;  told the child to go up and ask *which* horse he could play with,\r<br/>\n&gt; instead of\r<br/>\n&gt;  asking *if* he could play with one.  It was overwhelming to me and to\r<br/>\n&gt; my\r<br/>\n&gt;  kids.  My kids didn&#39;t feel safe sharing with the multitude of\r<br/>\n&gt; children who\r<br/>\n&gt;  all wanted to play with their horses.  They ended up putting them away\r<br/>\n&gt;  completely or playing with one horse at a time so they wouldn&#39;t have\r<br/>\n&gt; to deal\r<br/>\n&gt;  with the onslaught of children asking to play with their horses. I\r<br/>\n&gt; felt like\r<br/>\n&gt;  we were being stalked by one child who kept tracking us down, looking\r<br/>\n&gt; for\r<br/>\n&gt;  their bags of horses so he could take one.  I just felt awful.  I\r<br/>\n&gt; felt like\r<br/>\n&gt;  I was hoarding them and hiding them.  But I also felt like it isn&#39;t\r<br/>\n&gt; up to me\r<br/>\n&gt;  to allow other children to play with my children&#39;s things. (they\r<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t mine\r<br/>\n&gt;  to give permission to use.)   I wasn&#39;t going to dismiss my own\r<br/>\n&gt; children&#39;s\r<br/>\n&gt;  feelings on the issue and *make* them share or coerce them to share. \r<br/>\n&gt; I know\r<br/>\n&gt;  that many people just expect children to share regardless of the\r<br/>\n&gt;  circumstances and it makes me feel really bad.  It&#39;s still bugging\r<br/>\n&gt; me.  \r<br/>\n&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;  I explained to some children that the girls weren&#39;t comfortable\r<br/>\n&gt; sharing\r<br/>\n&gt;  right now.  If my girls were handling it fine, I let them deal with\r<br/>\n&gt; it.\r<br/>\n&gt;  Other than feeling frustrated, they did fine telling the other\r<br/>\n&gt; children\r<br/>\n&gt;  gently, that they didn&#39;t want to play right now or that they weren&#39;t\r<br/>\n&gt;  comfortable sharing right now.  My kids play best with one or two\r<br/>\n&gt; friends at\r<br/>\n&gt;  a time.  They just don&#39;t feel comfortable in large groups.  Just\r<br/>\n&gt; coming to\r<br/>\n&gt;  the conference was stressful to us all.\r<br/>\n&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;  I am confident that children should be allowed to choose who they\r<br/>\n&gt; share\r<br/>\n&gt;  their toys with.  I want to not feel so badly about my choice to let\r<br/>\n&gt; them\r<br/>\n&gt;  decide.  Do I just need to get a spine?  Feeling bad to some extent,\r<br/>\n&gt; must be\r<br/>\n&gt;  normal, but I shouldn&#39;t still be thinking about it days later.\r<br/>\n&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;  To add to my concern, we came home and dd&#39;s told dh what\r<br/>\n&gt; happened...that\r<br/>\n&gt;  everyone seemed to want their horses.  They said they put them away\r<br/>\n&gt; instead\r<br/>\n&gt;  of handing them out to all the kids and he said something to the\r<br/>\n&gt; effect that\r<br/>\n&gt;  they must have seemed really selfish to have done that.  I&#39;ve talked\r<br/>\n&gt; with\r<br/>\n&gt;  him about the whole sharing thing.  I mentioned that he wouldn&#39;t just\r<br/>\n&gt; give\r<br/>\n&gt;  over his laptop or palm pilot to any two year old who wanted to play\r<br/>\n&gt; with\r<br/>\n&gt;  it. \r<br/>\n&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;  I feel stingy just sending this out to the list.

I thought that other children who like horses might bring theirs <br/>\nand<br/>\nthey could all play together. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - mom suggested that they bring them in order to play with other <br/>\nkids. But, I&#39;m saying that is not a good choice for that purpose - if <br/>\nthe goal is to have some fun playing with other kids, don&#39;t bring <br/>\nsomething that you don&#39;t want to share, bring something specifically TO <br/>\nshare.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids would have left her kids alone - gazing longingly at the horses <br/>\nfrom a distance &lt;G&gt;.

(I talked with a friend about it this<br/>\nafternoon and that helped me gain some perspective.)   In the end, the girls<br/>\nkept out one horse at a time after we realized that it was causing a<br/>\nproblem.  That seemed to help. (But yeah, when they really get into playing,<br/>\nthey all have a bunch of horses to play with.) <br/>\n <br/>\nI understand what you are saying about buying some for a group to share, but<br/>\nthat isn&#39;t realistic for us because they cost so much.  The Traditional<br/>\nBreyers start at about $30 each and go up.  (not quite the same as match<br/>\nboxes or something.)   If it were a continual problem, I might invest in<br/>\nthem, but this situation comes up so rarely that it wouldn&#39;t be worth it to<br/>\nme.  Just going to the conference was stretching our budget, a lot.  We<br/>\ncould have gotten some cheap dollar store horses to share, but I think the<br/>\ndifference in the horses would be so glaringly obvious that the kids might<br/>\nstill have felt left out.  (I think I have issues with pleasing everyone all<br/>\nthe time.   I didn&#39;t want anyone to feel bad or left out but I wanted my<br/>\nkids to be happy and feel safe with their stuff too.)<br/>\n <br/>\nWe also could have brought things that weren&#39;t so personal, but the whole<br/>\nidea was to meet some other children who like the same things so they could<br/>\nhave a real connection.  My girls live to ride horses and play with their<br/>\nBreyer horses.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy girls have always been quite reserved around people they don&#39;t know, so<br/>\nit comes as a surprise to me (it probably shouldn&#39;t, I&#39;ve lived long enough<br/>\nto learn) when children approach us ready to join right in or just even just<br/>\ntake things.  Different personalities, I think, but having my little ones<br/>\ntake other kid&#39;s toys wasn&#39;t ever an issue, so I didn&#39;t really think of it<br/>\nahead of time.  We don&#39;t do group things very often because the girls just<br/>\naren&#39;t comfortable in group settings. <br/>\n <br/>\nThank you all for your responses.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAngela <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"Mary Gold","from":"&quot;Mary Gold&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Sharing Again","postDate":"1093984957","msgId":98952,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNoMm5ydCtiaWExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDMwNENFODRFLUZCNkUtMTFEOC1CN0M1LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":98949,"nextInTopic":98953,"prevInTime":98951,"nextInTime":98953,"topicId":98940,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... either (maybe only those with that particular love really can understand how MUCH they love those plastic forms ).

I have a big bag of sand toys, and I&#39;ve recently added a bag with a couple of soft ball & bat sets, some frisbees and a couple of big balls (soccer, etc).  I just toss them out on the ground, and as kids wander by we invite them to play with us.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe same could be done with inside toys.  I have boys, so with us it&#39;s HotWheels cars, duplo/lego blocks and the like.  There are some toys almost no kids can resist, and they&#39;re cheap enough to buy enough to share.  We find some of our best stuff at the dollar store or Target, end of season. <br/>\n <br/>\nI can understand why the kids wanted to bring their favorite toys.  Maybe you could have brought both the horses, and other less-precious toys to share publicly, saving the horses for smaller playdates with other kids who had horses or who understood the importance of the horses.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
