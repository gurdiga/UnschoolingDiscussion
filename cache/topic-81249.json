I did verify college degrees by <br/>\nphone, though.  Lots of folks stretch the truth a bit on masters <br/>\ndegrees, I&#39;ve learned.&lt;&gt;  <br/>\n <br/>\nElizabeth:<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it depends on the job.  I was hired to do test-scoring this <br/>\npast year (scoring state proficiency tests) and they had to see the <br/>\ndiploma or else I had to pay for full transcripts.  That was because <br/>\ntheir contracts with various states required degreed employees to <br/>\nscore those idiot tests.  Go figure.  But for many other jobs, of <br/>\ncourse, no one is going to bother to check.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter just applied for a job at the library, a very good job <br/>\nfor a 16-year-old with better than average pay and very flexible <br/>\nhours, (plus a great learning environment and a chance to meet cute <br/>\nguys who come to the library).  They required references and they <br/>\nactually phoned and checked with each one!  And they also require a <br/>\ndrug test.  Since she is home educated they did not require any <br/>\nschool references, however.  But the head librarian made an <br/>\ninteresting comment to my daughter about homeschoolers; something to <br/>\nthe effect that they usually do not do as well on the qualifying test <br/>\nas public schoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder how many homeschoolers have applied for jobs there?  The <br/>\nqualifying test, by the way, had to do with putting books in order as <br/>\nthey would be placed on the shelves under the Dewey Decimal System.  <br/>\nSo the student has to know how to read the numbers and letters coded <br/>\non the books from the Dewey Decimal System.  This is not rocket <br/>\nscience, but apparently quite a few home educators do not bother to <br/>\nteach their kids how the DDS works and how books are to be found on <br/>\nthe shelves.  Might be something to organize with a group of <br/>\nhomeschoolers at your local library. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor those teens who are college bound that diploma or GED really do <br/>\nnot matter anymore.  The colleges that are homeschool friendly just <br/>\nwant a good detailed transcript.  And they want details about the <br/>\nactivities in which the student has participated.  That is way <br/>\nimportant for homeschoolers.  They may require an essay and some will <br/>\nrequire test scores, but not all.  They may also want letters of <br/>\nrecommendation.  So it really pays to shop around.  And there are <br/>\nother ways to get college degrees these day that do not require ever <br/>\nstepping foot in a college classroom, but still yield a solid fully <br/>\naccredited 4-year college degree.  Check out Brad Voeller&#39;s book, <br/>\nAccelerated Distance Learning, and his Global Learning Strategies <br/>\nwebsite: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.globallearningstrategies.org/\">http://www.globallearningstrategies.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading his book I figured out that you could, theoretically at <br/>\nleast, get a fully accredited 4-year degree for under $700 by taking <br/>\nthree GRE tests at $130 a piece and earning credit for 5 other <br/>\ncourses through CLEP or portfolio presentation or military exams or <br/>\ncredit by examination.  The total for this could be as low as $700 <br/>\nfor the highly motivated self-directed learner.  Amazine!  And he has <br/>\nso many great idea for different ways to do this that truly anyone <br/>\nwho wants a college degree should be able to get one.  And these are <br/>\ngood degrees, not just papermills.<br/>\n<br/>\nNorma  <br/>\n&quot;We have found out...that we cannot trust some people who are <br/>\nnonconformists...We will make conformists out of them...The <br/>\norganization cannot trust the individual; the individual must trust <br/>\nthe organization.&quot; Â– Ray Kroc<br/>\n<br/>\nNorma </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Diploma or GED?","postDate":"1064349117","msgId":81326,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZhLjM1OTU2MGY1LjJjYTIwN2JkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":81321,"nextInTopic":81327,"prevInTime":81325,"nextInTime":81327,"topicId":81249,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/23/03 5:53:47 AM, fetteroll@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-455049624\">In a message dated 9/23/03 5:53:47 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; A unschooler cannot<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; get an actual high school diploma without actually going to school right? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not a diploma from an accredited school.<br/>\nBut there are non-accredited private schools and always have been, so if you <br/>\nmake up a diploma it won&#39;t be any worse than one from a private school which <br/>\nis not accredited.

Diplomas are just the school giving a student a stamp of<br/>\napproval.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccredited schools, of course, have their standards set and watched over by<br/>\nthe government or some official group, so someone can check to see what the<br/>\ndiploma of an accredited school is supposed to mean, eg, 4 years of math.<br/>\nBut what &quot;4 years of math&quot; means is harder to quantify which is why<br/>\nstandardized tests are so popular. (At least in MA they were originally set<br/>\nup to make sure the teachers were having the effect expected of them. *That*<br/>\ndidn&#39;t last long :-/)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut ultimately diplomas don&#39;t mean much at all.

If he decides to take a course at a community college, he can<br/>\ncheck off &quot;some college&quot; on applications. It&#39;s helpful to look at what a<br/>\ncompany would like to see in an employee. They don&#39;t really care that<br/>\nsomeone has a high school diploma so much as they care about someone having<br/>\nwhat a diploma represents. A college may expect a certain body of knowledge<br/>\nto build from. And a diploma represents that. But it isn&#39;t the only way to<br/>\nget it.
