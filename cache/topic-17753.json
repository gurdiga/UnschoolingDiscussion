But<br/>\nalot of homeopathic medicine is based on using a<br/>\nsubstance in very small precise amounts that would<br/>\nnormally CAUSE symptoms, in order to treat them. (I<br/>\nknow I worded that in the most confusing way possible,<br/>\nbut hey, what can you do? Hopefully someone else will<br/>\nget what I&#39;m saying and interpret.) One time I<br/>\naccidentally gave dd more when she was little little<br/>\n(accidentally meaning she was crying and crying from<br/>\nteething, tired and just all out crankiness in the car<br/>\nand we pulled over at a park and she got all mad and<br/>\nfussy and knocked my hand when I was trying to pour<br/>\nthree into the other hand. Well, it was dark and I<br/>\nthought I counted two of them (they&#39;re really small)<br/>\nand gave them to her, and then gave her another and<br/>\nshe spit it out, though I couldn&#39;t find it&#39;s<br/>\ngooey-ness just yet. So I gave her a new one, in my<br/>\nmind totalling 3. Well, the first &quot;two&quot; were actually<br/>\n3 (two of them were stuck together) and she actually<br/>\nlicked the spit out one back in when I gave her the<br/>\nnew one.)  Well, needless to say it was too many for<br/>\nher little baby self at that age and it just made her<br/>\ncrying worse, cuz she was panicky. So I definitely<br/>\nDON&#39;T recommend giving the little ones these while in<br/>\na dark van in a dark park with a screaming baby whose<br/>\narms and legs are flailing. :)In homeopathic medicine<br/>\nthe medicines aren&#39;t administered like herbals where<br/>\nyou take such and such mgs or tablets...it is very<br/>\nvery precise, because some of them-like belladonna are<br/>\notherwise dangerous...I don&#39;t think twice about giving<br/>\nmy kids humphreys, and I would choose it (and do) in a<br/>\nhearbeat over giving them all the chemicals and<br/>\nmanmade medicines that make the pharmacutical<br/>\ncompanies rich, and have actually been shown to be<br/>\nharmful in the long run thru studies due to overuse,<br/>\netc. I don&#39;t mean to sound defensive, but I have just<br/>\nheard an awful lot from M.D&#39;s and people choosing<br/>\n&quot;conventional&quot; routes of health care about<br/>\n&quot;endangering&quot; my children and herbs/homeopathics being<br/>\nbad for them, almost constituting neglect, etc, etc,<br/>\nso many times that it just automatically comes off as<br/>\ndefensive-ness when I explain myself. <br/>\nThankyou for posting this actually, though, cuz I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t specify in my post about it being precise and<br/>\njust buying the already bottled and made up<br/>\n&quot;humphreys&quot;, but I listed the ingredients, (but not<br/>\nthe dosages) and someone may have thought &quot;I&#39;ll just<br/>\nmake my own&quot; sort of thing and ended up with very bad<br/>\nresults.

He also seems to ...be more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;spirited&quot;... when he gets embarrassed about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something...like if someone notices, for example,<br/>\n&gt; how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;much energy he has!!!&quot; or if someone gets annoyed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with him for literally bouncing off the walls, he<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; does it even moreso. Not to spite, but out of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; embarrassment and he &quot;can&#39;t handle it&quot; (my words)<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just acts bonkers. He gets an insomniatic (my very<br/>\n&gt; own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; word) hair from me, and I give him &quot;sleepytime&quot;<br/>\n&gt; tea<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Celestial Seasonings makes it) with lots of<br/>\n&gt; honey,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and now he loves it and actually asks for it,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; especially when he&#39;s sick. Also I got one time at<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; health food store here a &quot;bar&quot; (like a candy<br/>\n&gt; bar..or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to him anyway) that is called &quot;Pedi-Active&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something like that, and there were little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Pedi-Active&quot; chewable pills too, that we tried.<br/>\n&gt; They<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seemed to help somewhat, but not as much as the<br/>\n&gt; bar.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Who knows why. Maybe the bar had more EFA&#39;s in it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also my most favorite thing in the whole world<br/>\n&gt; (aside<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from Rescue Remedy, of course, which we share) is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; called &quot;Humphrey&#39;s 3&quot;...and they are<br/>\n&gt; &quot;teething/colic&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; homeopathic tablets and I gave them to ds when he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; first started teething and to dd when she was a<br/>\n&gt; very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gas-filled cranky baby and now when they have<br/>\n&gt; tummy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; aches or are getting restless (oh, it&#39;s also for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;wakefulness&quot;), and sometimes 30 minutes before<br/>\n&gt; bed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ds takes 5 now (he&#39;s a very skinny almost 6yo),<br/>\n&gt; and dd<br/>\n&gt; &gt; still takes 3, she doesn&#39;t need more. I have taken<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them sometimes, for a stomach ache and I took<br/>\n&gt; 7...(I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weighed about 115 at the time, to give you some<br/>\n&gt; idea<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of dosage for you dd) and they worked immediately.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The ingredients are:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chamomila coffee belladonna and sugar.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they dissolve on the tongue and taste ...like<br/>\n&gt; sugar.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I get them at wal-mart or any pharmacy open...you<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to ask for them at the counter.

Not to spite, but out of<br/>\nembarrassment and he &quot;can&#39;t handle it&quot; (my words) and<br/>\njust acts bonkers. He gets an insomniatic (my very own<br/>\nword) hair from me, and I give him &quot;sleepytime&quot; tea<br/>\n(Celestial Seasonings makes it) with lots of honey,<br/>\nand now he loves it and actually asks for it,<br/>\nespecially when he&#39;s sick. Also I got one time at the<br/>\nhealth food store here a &quot;bar&quot; (like a candy bar..or<br/>\nto him anyway) that is called &quot;Pedi-Active&quot; or<br/>\nsomething like that, and there were little<br/>\n&quot;Pedi-Active&quot; chewable pills too, that we tried. They<br/>\nseemed to help somewhat, but not as much as the bar.<br/>\nWho knows why. Maybe the bar had more EFA&#39;s in it.<br/>\nAlso my most favorite thing in the whole world (aside<br/>\nfrom Rescue Remedy, of course, which we share) is<br/>\ncalled &quot;Humphrey&#39;s 3&quot;...and they are &quot;teething/colic&quot;<br/>\nhomeopathic tablets and I gave them to ds when he<br/>\nfirst started teething and to dd when she was a very<br/>\ngas-filled cranky baby and now when they have tummy<br/>\naches or are getting restless (oh, it&#39;s also for<br/>\n&quot;wakefulness&quot;), and sometimes 30 minutes before bed.<br/>\nds takes 5 now (he&#39;s a very skinny almost 6yo), and dd<br/>\nstill takes 3, she doesn&#39;t need more. I have taken<br/>\nthem sometimes, for a stomach ache and I took 7...(I<br/>\nweighed about 115 at the time, to give you some idea<br/>\nof dosage for you dd) and they worked immediately.<br/>\nThe ingredients are:<br/>\nchamomila coffee belladonna and sugar.<br/>\nthey dissolve on the tongue and taste ...like sugar.<br/>\nI get them at wal-mart or any pharmacy open...you have<br/>\nto ask for them at the counter. It&#39;s about 3-5 dollars<br/>\nfor a bottle of 135 pellets.<br/>\nHope that helps a little.<br/>\n-Bobbie<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RValvo7626@...\">RValvo7626@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; In a message dated 3/30/01 7:25:36 PM Mountain<br/>\n &gt; Daylight Time,<br/>\n &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; &lt;&lt;  Dh and I did try an herbal supplement for<br/>\n &gt; &quot;active&quot; children to help his<br/>\n &gt; neurotransmitters connect so stepson could think<br/>\n &gt; better and control himself.<br/>\n &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;     May I ask what this herbal supplement was?
