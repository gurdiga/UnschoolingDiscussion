But <br/>\nthis whole attitude extends into fashion, food, child rearing outside <br/>\nof school, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am defintely the odd ball.  I guess my college degree and medical <br/>\nlicense means nothing.  In fact they act as if I have shamed the <br/>\nfamily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, well.  We just stay away and only do Christmas.
