I think they should<br/>\n&gt; &gt; either count it all or never change how they do it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My understanding is that there were changes made in 1994. So comparisons<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; years before and after 1994 are suspect (excuse the pun &lt;G&gt;). The changes<br/>\nhad<br/>\n&gt; to do with how they get the crime rates for the US as a whole. Each local<br/>\n&gt; jurisdiction reports, based on the very detailed requirements of the<br/>\nuniform<br/>\n&gt; reporting law. About 95 percent of local jurisdictions report. So - to get<br/>\n&gt; the numbers for the country as a whole, they have to sort of fill in the<br/>\ngaps<br/>\n&gt; - estimate the rates for those counties, for example, that don&#39;t report.<br/>\nThey<br/>\n&gt; do this based on information from other similar local areas. The<br/>\nmethodology<br/>\n&gt; used for this estimation was changed in 1994.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think acts of terrorism are collected in a separate database by the<br/>\nJustice<br/>\n&gt; Department.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since the FBI crime statistics are really intended only to look at<br/>\nreported<br/>\n&gt; crimes, there is another database which complements it by looking at crime<br/>\n&gt; from the point of view of victims. I believe it is based on surveys which<br/>\n&gt; attempt to get a sense of how many unreported crimes there are. This is<br/>\n&gt; called something like the National Victims of Crime Survey?? (Sorry - it<br/>\nhas<br/>\n&gt; been a while since I studied these things.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --pamS<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
