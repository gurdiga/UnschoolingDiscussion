The child who is conceived is <br/>\nreceived as a child/baby when the mother who is looking forward <br/>\nto pregnancy sees the little + sign on her pregnancy test strip. <br/>\nThe woman who finds herself pregnant unexpectedly does not <br/>\nfeel she is a mother at that moment in quite the same way but <br/>\nalmost feels invaded by an alien being that is sent to ruin her life. <br/>\nAnd I can imagine that would be terrifying and lonely. <br/>\n<br/>\nStarting from these two places creates very different emotions <br/>\nabout the role of abortion in our families or for women in general. <br/>\nAbortion is legal (not as a right as in free speech but as in legal <br/>\nlike drinking alcohol is legal) because of those women who feel <br/>\nkeenly the need to protect women who bear children from feeling <br/>\nvictimized by the obligations of pregnancy and child rearing. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut for women who start with the premise that children are <br/>\nsacred from conception or that pregnancy begins the role of <br/>\nnurturing that life, then abortion stands in relief against that view. <br/>\nAnd as an unschooler, I can see how it is perfectly natural to <br/>\nwant to evaluate at what point we say we are mothers whose <br/>\nrole it is to protect and care for that little life (even if it means <br/>\ngiving it up for adoption or raising it as a single mother) rather <br/>\nthan ending it before it has emerged from the womb.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; And fodder for flaming debate so we don&#39;t need to discuss the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>rightness of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; where to draw the line or even whether it&#39;s right to draw it at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Makes sense to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading so much about abortion on the other side of the <br/>\ndebate (which for me meant reading pro-choice material since I <br/>\nhad always been pro-life) in the last year, I am much more <br/>\nsympathetic to the desire to protect women. I understand better <br/>\nnot wanting to criminalize abortion. I also understand better why <br/>\nwomen feel unfairly singled out by their reproductive <br/>\ncapabilities to bear the burden of child-bearing and rearing.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven after that, though, I find that motherhood for me began the <br/>\nfirst time that little strip turned red or showed the + sign. My <br/>\nodyssey of parenting began in that moment. And it continues <br/>\nwith the same level of concern and agitation and joy that it began <br/>\nwith that day six weeks after conception.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our home, abortion would be an incompatible choice with <br/>\nunschooling. As I raise a teenage daughter, I find that is how we <br/>\nsee it too. Motherhood is the direct result of sexual activity that<br/>\nis unprotected (and then even sometimes when it is, as we have <br/>\ndaily proof with our number five who defied the condom). I would <br/>\nhope that she would take that potential responsbility seriously <br/>\neven before she is married and would not choose abortion if <br/>\nfaced with pregnancy.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart &lt;julie@bravewriter.com&gt;","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart &lt;julie@...&gt;&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Sex and Dating (and drugs, etc.)","postDate":"1042468158","msgId":54711,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGF2dWlmdStiNWJwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBNDgwMzJCLjEyMEM4JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":54696,"nextInTopic":54716,"prevInTime":54710,"nextInTime":54712,"topicId":54583,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Joyce thanks for a very helpful post.

We, of course, hope<br/>\nthat our children will take on our values, but if they do not, they will<br/>\nstill always be our children and we will love them for who they are.
