Not every outing is<br/>\nentertaining&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is exactly where I was last year.  I used to argue about &quot;OK maybe you<br/>\ncan coddle an only child, but I have 5.  No way to please them all so I will<br/>\njust do it my way.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, then I continued hanging around this list  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThink Mary Poppins...A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down.  2<br/>\nexamples from today:  Had to take Adriane&#39;s goat to the vet.  Zach (8)<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to stop working on the &quot;scope&quot; he is making for his BB gun so he<br/>\nstayed home.  The little guys (4, 2, 2) had no option but to go.  Nobody<br/>\ncomplained, everybody pitched in but on the way home Marsie asked to go down<br/>\na certain hilly, curvy road.  I actually just wanted to go home and this<br/>\nroad takes us a little out of our way......but the little kids loved it and<br/>\nthey had really been part of the Stauffer team this am....so down the hills<br/>\nwe went, complete with hands in air and squealing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHadn&#39;t been home half an hour and I realized I was out of detergent.  It was<br/>\nmy fault (just went to the store a couple of days ago and didn&#39;t get any)<br/>\nand the inconvenience was to me (laundry would be delayed).  I talked to the<br/>\nkids about going to the store and Adriane (10) said she wanted to stay home.<br/>\nI said I had hoped to just send her in to the store so I didn&#39;t have to load<br/>\nand unload all the little guys.  She wrinkled her nose.  Well, I thought we<br/>\nwere going to the store and the kids had to have lunch anyway.  I suggested<br/>\nthat she might like to pick out something for lunch (like pizza).  Suddenly<br/>\nshe was all game, in fact everybody did the pizza dance out to the car.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of these examples really interfered with my day at all.  Working as<br/>\na team really helped me out and nobody had a fit....win-win.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you are correct, occassionally we all have to do stuff that sucks,<br/>\nnothing is going to make it more palatable.  But...I truly believe that a<br/>\nlittle creativity and thoughtfulness cuts down drastically on the number of<br/>\nthose occassions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you really did need your dh to go somewhere with you and what if he<br/>\nreally didn&#39;t want to go?  Maybe it is a dinner with your boss.  You really<br/>\nneed to be there and it would be so much nicer if hubby was along....and he<br/>\nhates your boss.  Finds him boring.  You might be willing to do something<br/>\nfor dh to make it worth his while to help you out.  (OK, what you would do<br/>\nfor dh is probably not what you would do for the kids LOL, but you get my<br/>\ndrift).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would we be nicer to dh than to the kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24782,"nextTopicId":24885}}
