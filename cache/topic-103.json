If you belong to a Butler County home school group<br/>\n&gt; please<br/>\n&gt; be sure to notify your friends as well.  At the end of this message I have<br/>\n&gt; provided a URL to a Notification Form which meets the state minimum<br/>\n&gt; requirements for annual notification.  As well, I have attached the text<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; this form for those on JUNO.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Butler County has requested the following not required by law.<br/>\n&gt; 1.  Name of school system you reside in.<br/>\n&gt; 2.  Home phone number (labeled optional)<br/>\n&gt; 3.  Have asked you to specify the home school parents level of education.<br/>\n&gt;         This is not required by law.  By law you only<br/>\n&gt;         have to agree that you meet one of the criteria,<br/>\n&gt;         you do not need to tell them which one you meet!<br/>\n&gt; 4.  Stated in their cover letter that they &quot;need to notify everyone&quot; about<br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt; home school activities.<br/>\n&gt;         I have not called to determine what this means,<br/>\n&gt;         however, State Law does not require or stipulate<br/>\n&gt;         that any other state agencies or educational<br/>\n&gt;         institutions should be notified about your intent<br/>\n&gt;         to home school your child.  I plan to call the<br/>\n&gt;         Superintendent tomorrow to determine the<br/>\n&gt;         extent of this comment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Andrew Bare - At-HomeDad, Home Schooler<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.infinet.com/~baugust/assess.html\">http://www.infinet.com/~baugust/assess.html</a>&gt;Notification and Assessment<br/>\n&gt; Forms<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Below is the text from the notification form provided at the<br/>\n&gt; above URL compliments of Belinda F.
