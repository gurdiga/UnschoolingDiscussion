All they would have had to do is provide <br/>\na nice, cozy home environment with no peanuts in it! <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a sad story I read a few months ago about a boy in a school <br/>\nwhere a mom brought chocolate cookies in for the class.  This was an <br/>\nolder boy, who knew to not eat peanuts.  He never imagined that there <br/>\nwould be peanut butter in what looked like plain chocolate cookies.  <br/>\nHe ate a cookie and died. :(  There was another story around the same <br/>\ntime where a young boy was on a field trip and a chaperone gave him a <br/>\npeanut butter cracker and he died.  :(<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Allison Crilly&quot; &lt;AllisonC@m...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When I worked at my son&#39;s school lunch program a few years ago, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>there was a boy with a severe peanut allergy.  Just touching a <br/>\nwrapper with a small amount of peanuts on it (and I&#39;m talking very <br/>\nsmall here, like peanut dust) could be absorbed through his skin and <br/>\ncause an anaphylactic response.  He has to sit at a seperate table, <br/>\nthe table had to be washed down with diluted bleach before and after <br/>\neach meal, every child who sat at that table had to have their <br/>\nlunches checked, and anything that might contain peanuts, or didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave a complete list of ingredients had to be put away till after <br/>\nlunch.  The first time he&#39;d reacted to peanuts was when he picked up <br/>\nan empty Reese&#39;s wrapper, didn&#39;t put it in his mouth or anything, <br/>\njust touched it.  The peanut residue was absorbed through his hand.  <br/>\nThis kind of severe allergy is very uncommon, but there is usually at <br/>\nleast one child per group (like in a daycare or school population) <br/>\nwho will have a food allergy similar to this, maybe not quite as bad, <br/>\nbut still very life threatening.  This child had an epi-pen in the <br/>\nlunchroom, in the office, in every classroom he might go to, in the <br/>\nteacher&#39;s lounge.  When we were trained on the Epi-pen, we were told <br/>\nit would give us 10-15 minutes to get him to the hospital before he <br/>\nstopped breathing altogether.  Without the epi-pen, about 2 minutes.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Allison<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Tami Labig-Duquette <br/>\n&gt;   To: Unschooling-dotcom@y... <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, November 17, 2001 10:57 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] peanut allergy/was digest #?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Even sitting at a park where someone else had eaten a PB&J could <br/>\n </span></blockquote>be a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   serious health hazard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   How?

At the most it can give maybe 20 minutes of time, usually more like 10 (depends on how much allergen was ingested or exposed.)  After it wears off, the reaction goes on as bad as before. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s quite easy to learn how to use an Epi-pen, most teachers don&#39;t want to be solely responsible for someone&#39;s life (and I can understand that.)  With nut allergies, the thinking is usually that  nuts are not a major part of anyone&#39;s diet, so for the non-allergic people, it&#39;s an inconvenience to have them banned, while for the allergic kids, it&#39;s potentially life-saving.  I didn&#39;t mind the peanut ban at daycare much, but then again, Owen doesn&#39;t like peanut butter, all it meant for me was cutting out the daily granola bar.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, some anaphylactic reactions are not as noticeable.  My neice has a severe allergy to bee and wasp stings.  She doesn&#39;t stop breathing, though.  Her blood pressure drops until her heart stops (very rare allergy, extremely dangerous.)  The first sign that she&#39;s reacting is that she gets tired and dopey.  Now that she&#39;s 11, she can tell us if she&#39;s been stung, but when she was younger, she couldn&#39;t always verbalize it.  If she had been at school when she had her first bad reaction, she might have just been sent to the office to call her parents, it doesn&#39;t look like a life threatening reaction at first.  Since peanut allergy reactions are so easily preventable, it makes sense to school boards just not to deal with them at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAllison<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Tia Leschke <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, November 17, 2001 11:39 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: peanut allergy/was digest #?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  At 05:05 PM 11/17/01 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;Somepeople with nut allergies can be so allergic that even breathing<br/>\n  &gt;in the scent of PB can send them to the hospital.

Just touching a wrapper with a small amount of peanuts on it (and I&#39;m talking very small here, like peanut dust) could be absorbed through his skin and cause an anaphylactic response.  He has to sit at a seperate table, the table had to be washed down with diluted bleach before and after each meal, every child who sat at that table had to have their lunches checked, and anything that might contain peanuts, or didn&#39;t have a complete list of ingredients had to be put away till after lunch.  The first time he&#39;d reacted to peanuts was when he picked up an empty Reese&#39;s wrapper, didn&#39;t put it in his mouth or anything, just touched it.  The peanut residue was absorbed through his hand.  This kind of severe allergy is very uncommon, but there is usually at least one child per group (like in a daycare or school population) who will have a food allergy similar to this, maybe not quite as bad, but still very life threatening.  This child had an epi-pen in the lunchroom, in the office, in every classroom he might go to, in the teacher&#39;s lounge.  When we were trained on the Epi-pen, we were told it would give us 10-15 minutes to get him to the hospital before he stopped breathing altogether.  Without the epi-pen, about 2 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAllison<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Tami Labig-Duquette <br/>\n  To: Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, November 17, 2001 10:57 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] peanut allergy/was digest #?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Even sitting at a park where someone else had eaten a PB&J could be a<br/>\n  serious health hazard.<br/>\n<br/>\n  How?
