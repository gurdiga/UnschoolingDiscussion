When I have a stressless week or <br/>\nso, they start to grow, but the moment the pace of life heats up again, they <br/>\ndisappear without my even noticing. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was just a little older than your son, I really wanted to stop biting <br/>\nmy nails, and actually managed it for a while.  I did it one nail at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\n I resolved that I would really try not to bite the nail on the little finger <br/>\nof one hand. (The hand I chewed less.) When that nail grew a bit, I tried not <br/>\nto bite the nail on the little finger of the other hand, either. Then added <br/>\nthe ring finger on the first hand. And so on.  Having a good selection of <br/>\nchewable nails helped me maintain the chew-free zone. <br/>\n<br/>\nPainting the tip of the designated digit with an anti-nailbiting solution <br/>\nhelps. But you have to keep slashing it on.  Then, once it is length <br/>\nenhanced, the nominated nail feels different in the mouth, which also acts as <br/>\na reminder, should it inadvertently enter forbidden territory.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always eschewed (ouch) chewing gum - nasty disgusting stuff. But I <br/>\nhave recently been doing experiments, to see whether chewing gum in the <br/>\nprivacy of my own home will give me the oral satisfaction gained from <br/>\ncalorie-laden snacking. Somewhat to my surprise, it seems to work!  So <br/>\nperhaps gum could also help with the nail-biting?  Then again, perhaps gum is <br/>\nghastlier........<br/>\n<br/>\n        Mattie (who apologies for any queasiness caused)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"JodyeB1@aol.com","from":"JodyeB1@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"YExoR8JbCYKwa_x6_fmeGCwvzphrDuVehCXHfSS7xBlPJD6vLK_CgS2vzn8xDdOSihnexJfM","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Nail biting","postDate":"956669773","msgId":8286,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuNTExMWZhNy4yNjM2Zjk0ZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8323,"prevInTime":8285,"nextInTime":8287,"topicId":8286,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My soon to be ten year old son bites his finger nails constantly.
