Some were given to us, some they picked <br/>\nout at Toys&#39;RUs or a bookstore, some I bought because they had some sort of <br/>\npuzzle the kids were liking.  They&#39;re treated like coloring books, maze <br/>\nbooks, word-search... they go in the pile of books to pick up and mess with <br/>\nif you feel like it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was one good Animaniacs math book that got a fair amount of use.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have never completel finished a coloring book or a workbook.  I would <br/>\nno more make them work in one than in the other.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I was wondering what many of you do in a <br/>\nnormal day to teach your kids.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI do little to nothing to teach them, but I am kind of having my radar out <br/>\nfor being there if they&#39;re trying to do, learn, or puzzle something out and <br/>\nthey might be stuck or frustrated, and I might boost or nudge.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t get into my van.  I can get up to the door into a good position.  But <br/>\nsomeone else has to boost me up far enough for me to get onto the seat.  This <br/>\nis recent and temporary.  When I have a walking cast instead of &quot;don&#39;t put <br/>\nweight on this,&quot; I&#39;ll be able to get in myself.  So it&#39;s kind of like that.  <br/>\nThey can get in position to complete an idea or a project, and if it looks <br/>\nlike they need a word spelled, or a suggestion for which kind of glue to use, <br/>\nor where to look for something, I&#39;ll nudge or boost.<br/>\n<br/>\nTomorrow night I have to get into the van again.  We&#39;re going to see Fiddler <br/>\non the Roof.  I get to sit in the wheelchair row.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=- how to make a &quot;schedule&quot; of what to do.Any <br/>\nhelp/advice would be appreciahas to be anywhere except Kirby goes to work <br/>\nfrom 3:00 to 7:30 or so.  Tuesday Kirby has karate:  teaches, then has a <br/>\nclass, then two hours of kobudo (weapons) with the adults.<br/>\nSo far the week sounds like Kirby&#39;s all organized!  But most of the week <br/>\nKirby is out and about with older friends, playing board games, playing card <br/>\ngames, playing video games, hanging around IHOP where one of them works.  <br/>\nWednesday Holly has a fiddle lesson.  Keith has &quot;fighter practice&quot; (armored <br/>\ncombat, SCA, or did until lately;  They quit when daylight savings time and <br/>\ncoldness arrive).  Etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than those kinds of appointments, we have some checklists and deadline <br/>\nconsiderations.  It&#39;s not a structure that looks like school.  It&#39;s a <br/>\nstructure that looks like my life has always looked.  Too much stuff, too <br/>\nmany commitments, lots of movies and music and jokes and people in and out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNew things come into the house, they&#39;re examined, discussed, named, played <br/>\nwith, shown around, and eventually put somewhere.  Maybe eaten, if <br/>\nappropriate.  Things to leave the house, we check whether others approve of <br/>\nit being given away or whatever, we discuss it, it&#39;s delivered or mailed or <br/>\ngiven to charity or whatever.  That&#39;s a lot of categorization, verbal and <br/>\nmental.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trick-or-treaters have returned.  It&#39;s 10:16.  There were several teens <br/>\nand two younger girls (10 and 12).  When they finished our neighborhood, they <br/>\ngot in two vehicles and drove to the neighborhood of the granny of one of <br/>\nthem, and did some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery year before this I have claimed some candy as a fee for walking around <br/>\nwith a trick-or-treater.  THIS year for the first time I shall have to simply <br/>\nbeg politely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI saved some milk from the dinner Keith brought me, to wash down the candy I <br/>\nhope I will receive.  Keith has gone to bed.  I will too, soon, on the couch, <br/>\nby the fire, under the influence of pain killers and muscle relaxers.  I will <br/>\nsleep the fitful twitchy sleep of the drugged.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne weird effect of the drugs when I was taking them more frequently, the <br/>\nfirst two weeks, was interesting.  I would kind of talk in my sleep, but not <br/>\ntalk at all.  It was moving my hands in my sleep, which I&#39;ve never done <br/>\nbefore.  I would be dreaming of doing something, and would move my hands in <br/>\nthe same way sometimes people talk in their sleep.  I know, because I would <br/>\nwake myself up with it.  One night I dreamed of sorting warm laundry, to fold <br/>\ntowels.  I was pulling on my shirt, and it wasn&#39;t lifting up, but I kept <br/>\ngrabbing the cloth and pulling it.  I dreamed I was eating, and I touched my <br/>\nhand to my mouth.  I dreamed someone was giving me a taste of something, and <br/>\nI opened my mouth and lifted my head up, and it woke me up.  I have reached <br/>\nout my arm to touch something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Holly if I could please have some of her candy.  She said, &quot;Sure, but <br/>\nfirst we&#39;re going to clean up the bathroom some because we made a mess.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mess, she had warned me about.  They got glitter in the bathroom I&#39;m <br/>\nusing.  It has a big mirror, and she and Jasmine did their face paints in <br/>\nthere.  Jasmine was a statue, so her makeup was all white, with a little <br/>\nglitter.  Holly was a peacock, so she had several colors and lots of glitter. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI recommended wet toilet paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s pretty cool that they thought of cleaning that mess up as soon as they <br/>\nwere done trick-or-treating.  It wasn&#39;t my idea or suggestion.  They wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave &quot;been in trouble&quot; if they didn&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo...<br/>\nHere we have a child who has always been allowed to eat all the candy she <br/>\nwants, and on the biggest candy-night, following four and a half hours of <br/>\nmostly trick or treating, she chooses to... clean a bathroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48980,"nextTopicId":48998}}
