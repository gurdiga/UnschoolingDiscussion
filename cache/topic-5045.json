Last night dh was just drifting off to sleep when 16yro <br/>\nwent in and showered in our shower, which woke dh up.  (They have their own <br/>\nbath.) Not to mention that each of the older boys came in the other night and <br/>\nopened the broken fridge door..thump. Even with signs on it. <br/>\n    I shouldn&#39;t&#39;be up but I am just able to get on the computer.17yro thought <br/>\nhe&#39;d change the background or something on my screen and the picture had been <br/>\nrolling since yesterday. We just fixed it.<br/>\n    This has been a really rough week so far and it&#39;s only Wed.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5042,"nextTopicId":5043}}
