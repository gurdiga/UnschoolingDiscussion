Now a leading Internet<br/>\n&gt; news site in both traffic and influence, WorldNetDaily.com has broken some of<br/>\n&gt; the biggest, most significant and most notable investigative and enterprising<br/>\n&gt; stories in recent years:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; WorldNetDaily.com&#39;s editorial policy reflects the old-fashioned notion that<br/>\n&gt; the principal role of the free press in a free society is to serve as a<br/>\n&gt; watchdog on government -- to expose corruption, fraud, waste and abuse<br/>\n&gt; wherever and whenever it is found.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which makes it sound pretty good.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you Google Joseph Farah and the Western Journalism Center, you&#39;ll<br/>\nfind the Western Journalism Center was founded by Joseph Farah and James H.<br/>\nSmith, the former publisher of the Sacramento Union.<br/>\n<br/>\nand under the WJC FAQs it says:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2.)

By compiling a computerized record of nearly all his<br/>\n&gt; contributions over four decades, The Washington Post found that Scaife and his<br/>\n&gt; family&#39;s charitable entities played a central role in the rise of the right,<br/>\n&gt; giving at least $340 million to conservative causes and institutions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah.

Is it a homeschooling <br/>\nnews? <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout HSLDA, I have been seeing their work around me more and more lately. <br/>\nHomeschooling here in Kansas is fairly straightforward. Anyone with half a <br/>\nbrain can figure it out. But twice in the past week I have heard some <br/>\ndisturbing things. One lady called me, (don&#39;t know how she got my number, but <br/>\nanyway...) asking about homeschooling in Kansas. I gave her some resources <br/>\nand she asked about the laws. She said someone had told her to join HSLDA <br/>\nthat it was the only way to homeschool legally. I just couldn&#39;t convince her <br/>\nthat that wasn&#39;t true.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, at Karate the other day, the instructors wife and I were talking. And <br/>\nshe was asking about our homeschooling. This has become a popular topic <br/>\nwhenever she and I are sitting with each other. She had been given this 80 <br/>\npage booklet by a woman she had contacted about homeschooling. She told me it <br/>\nwas all about how to follow the law of homeschooling in Kansas. I must have <br/>\nlooked shocked because she asked if I had a copy. (I don&#39;t, but want to see <br/>\nit!) I told her that the law in Kansas isn&#39;t so hard to warrant an 80 page <br/>\nbooklet. Then she said that some of it covered how to homeschool legally, how <br/>\nto keep records for the state and other things to keep on the right side of <br/>\nthe law. I tried to explain how very untrue this is, but she has already got <br/>\nthis idea in her head from this other woman and this book thing. And I am <br/>\nsure she is sitting there wondering how I can be homeschooling all this time <br/>\nand NOT have heard about this, and NOT have been following the rules like she <br/>\nis sure I should be. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I can&#39;t quote the statutes verbatim, but I do know what they say and <br/>\ncan&#39;t believe there is a booklet(s) floating around making homeschooling more <br/>\ndifficult than it is or should be. I also wonder about the whys. Why would <br/>\nthis type of thing be put out? Since it is, is this why there aren&#39;t as many <br/>\nunschoolers in the area? Unschooling already looks so different to most <br/>\npeople around here. I certainly didn&#39;t receive the welcome wagon when we <br/>\nfirst started and I had it in my head that I should join the local hsing <br/>\ngroup. I wonder how to combat this ignorance? I know it looks so good and <br/>\nlegal and answers all the questions about keeping hsing all wrapped up in a <br/>\nnice package that looks good to the officials. But it doesn&#39;t have to be that <br/>\nway. Not here anyway. I can stand my lone ground claiming *thats not right* <br/>\nall I want, but others with better looking pamphlets than me have been there <br/>\nfirst. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing I am most afraid of is, if this is the accepted thing to do in the <br/>\nhomeschooling circle, then how far away are we from someone saying *Hey, this <br/>\nshould be written into the law!*? <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1512150,"authorName":"Peggy","from":"Peggy &lt;peggy@...&gt;","profile":"waptia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Article: Homeschoolers get knock on door by police","postDate":"1037728452","msgId":10780,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEREE3QUM0LjI1QTkzQjkxQGxpbm1heC5zYW8uYXJpem9uYS5lZHU+"},"prevInTopic":10778,"nextInTopic":10791,"prevInTime":10779,"nextInTime":10781,"topicId":10774,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

A 1950 <br/>\nIllinois Supreme Court decision, People v. Levisen, established that <br/>\nhomeschooling falls under the requirements of a private school. <br/>\nPrivate schools are required only to teach the same branches of <br/>\ninstruction as public schools and to do it in the English language. <br/>\n<br/>\nHSLDA characterizes the situation in Illinois as one of many around <br/>\nthe nation in which school districts and government officials are <br/>\nseeking to wield greater control over home-based education. The U.S. <br/>\nnow has as many as 2 million homeschoolers, according to some <br/>\nestimates. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe state of California is warning parents that they cannot educate <br/>\ntheir children at home without acquiring a professional teaching <br/>\ncredential. Officials maintain this stance despite a statute that <br/>\nallows any parent to homeschool under a private school exemption. <br/>\nHomeschool defenders note that districts are motivated to keep as <br/>\nmany children in public school as possible because funds are <br/>\nallotted per student. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot much structure <br/>\n<br/>\nDennison told WorldNetDaily that it is the policy of his office to <br/>\nnot to comment on specific cases, but emphasized that in Illinois <br/>\nthere is no statute on homeschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So we are relying upon court cases as well as the compulsory <br/>\nattendance law,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that is extremely important in <br/>\nthe homeschooling process, because that does not give much <br/>\nstructure.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nDennison said that &quot;in some instances in which folks have chosen not <br/>\nto share information about their schooling with our office, we have <br/>\nasked that they attend a meeting prior to court action being taken, <br/>\nthat may be referenced as a pre-trial hearing.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s another opportunity to have a conversation about what in fact <br/>\nparents are doing about the homeschooling of their child,&quot; he said. <br/>\n<br/>\nKlicka maintains, however, that other superintendents in Illinois <br/>\naccept the procedure for homeschooling in the state that his group <br/>\nadvises, which is to prepare a &quot;statement of assurance.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a family is contacted, according to Klicka, they say, &quot;We&#39;ve <br/>\nestablished a private school in our home pursuant to the Levison <br/>\ncase. We&#39;re teaching the same branches of instruction as public <br/>\nschools.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nHome visit <br/>\n<br/>\nBut Christine Fortune told WND that two squad cars showed up at her <br/>\nhouse in Geneseo, Ill., in Henry County, in late October to deliver <br/>\na letter demanding that she appear at a &quot;pre-trial&quot; hearing. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne police cruiser pulled into her driveway, another parked on the <br/>\nstreet. One policeman then accompanied a truant officer and case <br/>\nworker to her door, while the other police officer waited in his <br/>\ncar. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I was very angry,&quot; said Fortune, who homeschools her 14-year-old <br/>\ndaughter Stephanie. &quot;[My children] were really perplexed why the <br/>\npolice were coming for me. It was way overkill for something that <br/>\nwas not even a certified, subpoena kind of letter. It was just <br/>\nsomething they could have popped in the mail.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nFortune, who served as a substitute public school teacher in the <br/>\ncountry for about 10 years, said she had homeschooled prior to this <br/>\nschool year without any interference. <br/>\n<br/>\nKlicka said that if a superintendent had evidence that a family is <br/>\nlying or is fraudulent, he should refer it to the prosecutor, <br/>\nbut &quot;this superintendent is thinking, &#39;I&#39;ve got to approve the <br/>\ncurriculum, I&#39;ve got to check up on the parents.&#39;&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschoolers are under no legal obligation to attend &quot;pre-trial <br/>\nhearings,&quot; which have no standards or guarantees, Klicka maintains. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They&#39;re not really &#39;pre-trial&#39; because there are no charges filed,&quot; <br/>\nhe said. &quot;It&#39;s just part of the intimidation tactics.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen questioned, the district attorney had no idea what standards <br/>\nwould be used to judge a homeschooler&#39;s curriculum, Klicka said. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn Oct. 18, just four or five days prior to the police-escorted <br/>\nvisit to Fortune&#39;s house, the homeschool mother allowed a case <br/>\nworker from the school district to come into her home. HSLDA <br/>\ncontends that mandatory home visits are violations of a family&#39;s <br/>\nright to privacy and the right to be free from unreasonable searches <br/>\nand seizures, as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution&#39;s Fourth <br/>\nAmendment. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;On the phone, [the case worker] said she wanted to review the <br/>\ncurriculum and see if I needed any help  is how she was phrasing <br/>\nit,&quot; Fortune said. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe case worker was escorted to a room to see the computer-based <br/>\ncurriculum Fortune&#39;s daughter uses. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The beauty of that program is it&#39;s perfect for any questions she <br/>\nwould have,&quot; Fortune said. &quot;It has a record of grades and the things <br/>\nthat have been done and lesson plans. I could have just produced <br/>\nthat for her very easily, but she never asked.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, said Fortune, the case worker &quot;was fixated on attendance <br/>\nrecords.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThat struck Fortune as being rather odd: &quot;I said, &#39;I don&#39;t do that  <br/>\nwe don&#39;t punch a time clock. I just write down what we do.&#39;&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I kept telling her,&quot; said Fortune, &quot;&#39;[My children] live here; they <br/>\nhaven&#39;t been absent once from the home.&#39;&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nDennison would not comment on Fortune&#39;s case, citing policy, but <br/>\nsaid police have been asked to accompany truant officers and case <br/>\nworkers in a &quot;very low profile, in a very courteous manner.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nDennison bases his approach on a memo issued by the Illinois State <br/>\nBoard of Education&#39;s legal department, which cites the 1974 federal <br/>\ncourt ruling Scoma vs. Chicago Board of Education. The memo <br/>\nsays &quot;the court emphasized that the burden of proof rests with the <br/>\nparents to establish that the plan of home instruction which they <br/>\nare providing to their children meets the state requirements.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe position paper says that &quot;if the regional superintendent is <br/>\ndissatisfied with the parents&#39; ability and/or willingness to <br/>\nestablish that home instruction in a specific instance satisfies the <br/>\nrequirements of state law, the regional superintendent may request <br/>\nthat regional or school district truant officer to investigate to <br/>\nsee that the child is in compliance with the compulsory attendance <br/>\nlaw.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a brief on Illinois state law, the HSLDA notes that Scoma v. <br/>\nChicago Board of Education &quot;found the Levisen decision to <br/>\nbe &#39;reasonable and constitutional.&#39;&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Levisen case, HSLDA says, &quot;the Illinois Supreme Court <br/>\nemphasized the right of parents to control their children&#39;s <br/>\neducation.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nLevisen held that: &quot;Compulsory education laws are enacted to enforce <br/>\nthe natural obligations of parents to provide an education for their <br/>\nyoung, an obligation which corresponds to the parents&#39; right of <br/>\ncontrol over the child. (Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 400.) The <br/>\nobject is that all shall be educated not that they shall be educated <br/>\nin any particular manner or place.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSince the police visit, Fortune has been referring all communication <br/>\nto HSLDA, which is helping three other families who are in a similar <br/>\nsituation. Membership with the Virginia-based group allows <br/>\nhomeschool families to take advantage of their legal resources. <br/>\n<br/>\nKlicka said he is advising his member families not to go to the <br/>\nhearings or allow home visits but to &quot;stand on a simple letter <br/>\ndeclaring they are legally homeschooling as a private school.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10740,"nextTopicId":10816}}
