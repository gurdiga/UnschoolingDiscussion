I think if you see it as no more important than the<br/>\n&quot;manipulatives&quot; I mentioned and are comfortable with your kids playing with<br/>\nthe program for 5 mintues and then never touching it again, and you have<br/>\nsome disposable cash, then you should get it ;-) If you think of Mortensen<br/>\nas a way to learn math you&#39;re going to be disappointed unless your kids<br/>\nthink it&#39;s the bees knees and do it the &quot;right&quot; way. If, on the other hand,<br/>\nyou know they will learn math from living life -- and you learn to recognize<br/>\nit in real life! :-) -- then it&#39;s just another thing to goof around with, as<br/>\nimportant in the great scheme of things as dice with more than 6 sides.<br/>\n(They&#39;re cool and nifty but no child&#39;s understanding of math depends on<br/>\nthem.) So, of course, why spend the money! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think *the* most important tool you can learn to use with your kids is how<br/>\nto do math in your head. Problem solve out loud when you&#39;re trying to figure<br/>\nout something. For instance to add 25+17 you can say it&#39;s 20+10 and 5+7. Or<br/>\ntake 3 from the 25 to get 17 up to 20 so it&#39;s 20+22. Avoid doing math on<br/>\npaper because it&#39;s way too abstract while kids are still figuring out how<br/>\nnumbers work and sets the numbers in concrete so they can&#39;t be changed about<br/>\nand manipulated.<br/>\n<br/>\non 1/26/02 12:14 PM, Sarah Carothers at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;d HIGHLY recommend the Miquan Math program with the cuisennaire rods.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I&#39;ve recommended it many times over the years.
