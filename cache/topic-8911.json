We spend our days just<br/>\ngoing through life lke a lot of people. Cooking, cleaning, running errands,<br/>\nect., but we do it with the twist of turning as much as we can into a<br/>\nlearning experience. I agree with Sue that it&#39;s hard for us to spend time<br/>\ntalking about what we&#39;re not doing. Even an a homeshooling (not unschooling)<br/>\nlist I don&#39;t think you&#39;d find people only talking about &quot;school&quot;. I&#39;m on 4<br/>\nlists, 3 of them unschooling and the topics are about things like extended<br/>\nnursing, vegetarianism, the family bed, food allergies, organic gardening,<br/>\nmusic lessons, and so on and so on.....Homeschooling is a way of life and it<br/>\nencompasses a lot of our days. I hope this is helpful.<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sue.m.e@...\">sue.m.e@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 04, 2000 11:28 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling lives [was... Need unschooling<br/>\ninput!]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello! This is my first day of being on this unschooling e-mail list.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not familiar with e-mail lists and I know I&#39;m behind on<br/>\n&gt; discussions, but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have received 14 e-mails today and none of them were related to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschooling. Is that a typical day? I can talk about other stuff<br/>\n&gt; with all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the people I see in person, but I can&#39;t talk about unschooling with<br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d love to hear what your children are doing and learning so I<br/>\n&gt; might not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feel all alone in this lifestyle and so that I might get some new<br/>\n&gt; ideas and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; perspectives--especially from those of you with young children.<br/>\n&gt; Mine are 5,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4, and 3. Thank you! --Becky<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Becky,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The problem with unschooling is that it is basically not doing<br/>\n&gt; something; i.e. not schooling, so it is very difficult to spend a lot of<br/>\n&gt; time talking about what we are not doing.   However to me<br/>\n&gt; unschooling is more of a lifestyle than a method of education, so<br/>\n&gt; this makes any topic at all relevant to an unschooling mailing list,<br/>\n&gt; and pertenant to unschooling itself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For example my children follow no curriculum & have no<br/>\n&gt; worksheets, they do nothing purely for the purpose of learning, but<br/>\n&gt; after saying that I must add that nearly all of what they do<br/>\n&gt; encourages and fosters learning.   Home is a 175 acre farm, with a<br/>\n&gt; 600&#39; hill, a valley with two trout stream, ponds, animals etc.  They<br/>\n&gt; have a microscope, many books, pencils, paper, computers with<br/>\n&gt; all kinds of programes and they have responsibilities.   Right now<br/>\n&gt; my 11 year old daughter has gone to Chicago with a family who<br/>\n&gt; visited the farm two weekends ago, their daughter ended up staying<br/>\n&gt; here last week and when her Mother came back to get her Rhianon<br/>\n&gt; went with them.  This is amazing to me considering that I only met<br/>\n&gt; these people 11 days ago, but we meet some really great people<br/>\n&gt; and strong friendships are sometimes formed.    Anyway where I<br/>\n&gt; was heading was to say that with Rhianon away, Madeleine [6] has<br/>\n&gt; to take the responsibility of milking the goat, Stephanie [4] is<br/>\n&gt; helping her and they collect the eggs from the chicken coop<br/>\n&gt; without being remended.  Milking the goat was Rhianon&#39;s descision<br/>\n&gt; as she wanted to bottle feed some kids, so I told ehr that to bottle<br/>\n&gt; feed kids she would have to milk a goat so they could be reared on<br/>\n&gt; fresh goat milk, she took this responsibility on the first day of<br/>\n&gt; February and until she went away yesterday has only missed one<br/>\n&gt; milking when she was sick one day.  Nathan [15] bottle rears three<br/>\n&gt; dairy calves at a time and takes care of most of the feeding of the<br/>\n&gt; animals, he can drive a truck, tractor, van and is just getting the<br/>\n&gt; hang of a 4 wheel drive pick-up that we bought from auction a few<br/>\n&gt; weeks ago.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some days are too long for all of us and the children all help out<br/>\n&gt; with whatever tasks they are capable of, mostly for the girls that<br/>\n&gt; involves care of the chickens and chicks, assisting with candling<br/>\n&gt; eggs and checking the incubators [I&#39;m guessing that we have at<br/>\n&gt; least 1000 chicks that we have hatched this year].  We have 4<br/>\n&gt; cows, 5 heifers, 3 bulls, 12 steers, a boar, 2 sows, a ram, 24<br/>\n&gt; ewes, 26 lambs, a buck, 8 does, 8 kids, 6 turkeys, 6 domestic<br/>\n&gt; geese, 5 Canada geese and their 9 goslings, 4 ducks and 23<br/>\n&gt; ducklings that we have incubated with 10 more due to hatch today<br/>\n&gt; [along with about 230 chicks] and of course about 200 chickens &<br/>\n&gt; at least 1000 chicks with around 200 more every six days.  So for<br/>\n&gt; my children between the wild creatures living here and the farm<br/>\n&gt; animals biology lessons take care of themselves(-;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When the daily tasks are done the kids have the freedom to do<br/>\n&gt; what they want with their time, Nathan spends a fair bit of time at<br/>\n&gt; the computer on web design or designing cars for GTA, the girls<br/>\n&gt; watch about 1 hour of television but prefer to spend time writing,<br/>\n&gt; drawing playing legos, playing in the sandbox or out exploring.  I<br/>\n&gt; am not actively teaching Maddi [6] and Steph [4] how to read, the<br/>\n&gt; only reading lessons they get is having people read to them and<br/>\n&gt; giving answers when asked what a word says or how to spell<br/>\n&gt; something.  I am not activelty teaching math, day to day life and<br/>\n&gt; expenses does that, for more advanced math if the need for it<br/>\n&gt; arises such as for Nathan with work on the computer answers are<br/>\n&gt; found by asking or researching.   My children who were in school<br/>\n&gt; [Rhianon for 1 1/2 years and Nathan 6 years] have regained their<br/>\n&gt; love of learning that school all but destroyed with it&#39;s mind<br/>\n&gt; numbingly boring games, Madeleine and Stephanie will never have<br/>\n&gt; to endure the hours of sitting at a desk being force fed<br/>\n&gt; unnecessary information [which is mostly forgotten anyway] just to<br/>\n&gt; pass some stupid test, they are free to learn at their own pace, if<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t read fluently &#39;til they are 12 it won&#39;t matter in fact it may<br/>\n&gt; be good for them as once we become literate the world changes,<br/>\n&gt; yes it can be for the better as we are then able to find all the<br/>\n&gt; information we need in books or on the &#39;net, but by having the<br/>\n&gt; ability to find what we need from books it partly kills off the<br/>\n&gt; scientist [who has to find his/her own answers] that is inate in all<br/>\n&gt; new-born babies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe if a few others on the list describe their lives it may help out<br/>\n&gt; any newbies who are looking for answers, we were all there once.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Sue<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Winona Farm in Minnesota Welcomes Unschoolers All Year Round<br/>\n&gt; My website:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e\">http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e</a><br/>\n&gt; Farm website:    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/\">http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/</a><br/>\n&gt; Farm newsletter: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;To believe in something, and not to live it,<br/>\n&gt;  is to be dishonest.&quot;   -Mahatma Gandhi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; CLICK HERE***SPECIAL OFFER***$60 in FREE calls<br/>\n&gt; ***SPECIAL OFFER***CLICK HERE<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4127/7/_/448294/_/960208754/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4127/7/_/448294/_/960208754/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To Unsubscribe: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8904,"nextTopicId":8871}}
