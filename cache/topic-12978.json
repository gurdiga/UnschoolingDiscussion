How on earth do you ~DO~ that???&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, if my best friend hadn&#39;t been a medical student, I might have been<br/>\nto the third trimester before I noticed.  I thought I had the flu. .<br/>\n.kept getting nauseated, was never hungry, had no energy.  When I<br/>\nmentioned it to her, she said, &quot;Go check your blood pressure at the drug<br/>\nstore.  If it&#39;s low, you better get a pregnancy test.&quot;  Et, voila!  I<br/>\nfound out I was about 2 months along.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had REALLY bad lower-back pains for a couple of (non-consecutive) days<br/>\nin the early days of my third trimester and some pain at the bottom of<br/>\nmy rib cage when he was at the &quot;stretching&quot; stage, but other than that<br/>\nand a need to pee frequently I didn&#39;t have any detectable symptoms until<br/>\nthe baby came out (I couldn&#39;t even feel my contractions--just an<br/>\nirresistable urge to bear down).  I didn&#39;t start to look pregnant (as<br/>\nopposed to just slightly chunckier than before I concieved) until about<br/>\n39 weeks.  Of course I could feel him wiggling around at the appropriate<br/>\nstage, and I HOPE that would&#39;ve tipped me off, but even the first couple<br/>\nof months of that just felt like gas in a funny location.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a good thing she figured it out.  It took me all the time I had to<br/>\nadjust to the idea.  Some days I think I still haven&#39;t figured out it&#39;s<br/>\nfor real, and he&#39;s 3!<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty Blagg</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12973,"nextTopicId":12622}}
