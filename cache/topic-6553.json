However, I feel I must<br/>\npoint out that my life was very diverse and I knew people and had friends<br/>\nfrom all walks of life where I grew up, in San Francisco.  While most folks<br/>\ndo not get the chance to live with such diversity daily, and it was one of<br/>\nthe up sides of growing up in the city, to say that NONE of us have ever<br/>\ngotten that opportunity is not correct.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had friends of every possible sexual orientation, family make-up, and<br/>\nbelief systems.  I had gay friends, srtaight friends with gay parents, and<br/>\nevery possible variation of that scenario.  I had friends who were homeless<br/>\nand lived in youth shelters or in the park or on the beach.  I had friends<br/>\nwith all sorts of substance abuse problems, friends from borken homes or in<br/>\nabusive situations, friends with single or divorced parents, friends who<br/>\nlived on their own and took care of themselves guite well at 14 and 15.  I<br/>\nhad friends who were Buddhist, Toaist, Protestant, Baptist, Catholic,<br/>\nLutheran, Athiest, Wiccan, Pagan, Eclectic, or just plain confused.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat was one of the things I loved the most about living there.  There was<br/>\nso very much rich diversity in cultural and personal beliefs.  It was easy<br/>\nto learn to be tolerant and accepting and open minded, and to learn to that<br/>\neveryone is a human being with the potential to be good and kind and<br/>\nwonderful or full of hate and rage.  I was weaned on these things.  It was<br/>\nall normal for me to see all these folks around me, to be the only English<br/>\nspeaker on the bus, the only white kid on the playground, the only person<br/>\nwith a two birth parent family, etc.  It was a wonderful element in growing<br/>\nup there, and I had the opportunity to open the minds of some folks who<br/>\nwere less fortunate in their environment by introducing them to some of my<br/>\nwonderful friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6549,"nextTopicId":6517}}
