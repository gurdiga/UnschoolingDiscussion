Today Charlotte (oldest) pulled out some <br/>\njigsaw puzzles and a game, and all kinds of activities and played with our 11 and <br/>\n12 yo foster sons (home from school for a week), and 10 yo adopted son.  She&#39;s <br/>\nable, again, to just be a &quot;little&quot; kid and enjoy it.  My 13 yo daughter is a <br/>\nhappy, bubbly kid again, not a tired, sullen grouch.  Once in a while she gets <br/>\nlonely for her friends at school, so I am very easy about her spending the <br/>\nnight with friends, (especially homeschool friends) and I am happy to take her <br/>\njust about anyplace.  I&#39;m so happy I have my kids back again too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85223,"nextTopicId":85344}}
