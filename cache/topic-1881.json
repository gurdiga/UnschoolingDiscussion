My 7yod does not<br/>\n&gt; yet read (much...she can read a few words).  I&#39;ve read many articles saying<br/>\n&gt; things like: a) just keep reading to the child and s/he will learn to read.<br/>\n&gt; b) When s/he&#39;s ready,  she will read,  whether it&#39;s at age 4 or even as late<br/>\n&gt; as nine or ten.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Read those articles again.  They&#39;re right!  Actually,  both of my <br/>\nchildren learned to read when they were still in ps,  but I have one <br/>\nearly reader and one late.  My late reader was sent to a special <br/>\nreading teacher, etc. etc. etc.  All this caused was a lot of <br/>\nfrustration and she still learned to read when she was ready.  <br/>\nFinally after homeschooling,  she does love to read even more than my <br/>\nearly reader.  I&#39;ve had unschooling friends whose kids began to read <br/>\nproficiently as late as their early teens.  Relax and enjoy reading <br/>\nto her.  I wish I still had a child that enjoyed being read to.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane from KS<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1845,"nextTopicId":1882}}
