It&#39;s just hard to stay cool and collected when I&#39;m attacked.<br/>\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\nYa know, I had to ponder long and hard before responding to this person... <br/>\nThe funny thing is his first e-mail asked if *everyone* in our group unschooled. <br/>\n I laughed and laughed then told him he only got that impression because I am <br/>\nso vocal on the list, that in truth *I* am the minority in the group.  I did <br/>\nask his purpose in publishing the names and e-mail addresses of the people who <br/>\nteach as he does (who wrote to him off-list).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut this tirade did force me to look at myself and MY attitudes toward others <br/>\nin the group.  *I* certainly have not been supportive of those who dwell on <br/>\n*breaking the will* of their children and forcing them to do their *school <br/>\nwork.*  I did feel smugly superior and it showed :&#39;(  I now know that I *teach <br/>\nbest what I need to learn most* (thank you Richard Bach) and have apologized to <br/>\nthe parents I feel I&#39;ve alienated by my lack of support.  Now when I hear &quot;I <br/>\ncan&#39;t unschool, his dad would take him from me&quot; I must have empathy, not <br/>\ncriticism ... tough leap to make, but I appreciate the opportunity to better myself <br/>\nand better support our group.
