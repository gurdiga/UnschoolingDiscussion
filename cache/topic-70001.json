Gail did <br/>\nsomething that disappointed Beth. Nothing horrible, but something Beth <br/>\nbelieved Gail was better than. (Gail, in retrospect, probably felt the same <br/>\nway.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth and discussed the fact that ultimately, ministers are people, and <br/>\nsometimes they miss the mark. Beth agreed, but also said, &quot;But I guess I <br/>\nexpect ministers to be better than that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll ideas of religion aside, I think Sandra serves more as a minister than <br/>\nand &quot;expert.&quot; As a result, probably we all expect more from her. Is this <br/>\nentirely fair? Well, maybe not, but there it is, and I&#39;m sure that Sandra <br/>\nknows that part of her reputation as someone people can turn to when they are <br/>\nstruggling with unschooling depends on her being able to maintain some of <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen...lo and behold! Sandra is not perfect! Sometimes she gets cranky, or <br/>\ntired, or pissed off, or just reaches the end of her rope with someone who <br/>\nseems committed to not getting it. Sometimes she has trouble getting what <br/>\nsomeone else is saying. Sometimes her patience just runs out. This e-mail <br/>\nthing is hard, and Sandra, it turns out, is human. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point here is not to excuse anyone -- minister, Sandra, Mother Theresa -- <br/>\nwhen they miss the mark, but to understand that we also have to take <br/>\nresponsibility for our own expectations of others. My experience of Sandra is <br/>\nthat  Sandra takes full responsibility for when she turns out to be human. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere ya go, Sandra...ya went from being Expert to a minister.... scary, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69939,"nextTopicId":69814}}
