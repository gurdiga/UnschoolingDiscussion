So it&#39;s not the fact that <br/>\nit&#39;s sugar, it&#39;s the cane itself.<br/>\nAll sugars/starches are converted to glucose in the body, that much <br/>\nis true. But how quickly they convert to glucose hugely affects the <br/>\nbiological response and how healthy it is. That&#39;s why the glycaemic <br/>\nindex (gi) was invented, to try and rate how quickly foods break <br/>\ndown to glucose.<br/>\nAlso, you&#39;ve got to remember that some sugars have trace minerals <br/>\nand other healthful side benefits. Honey has minerals, same with <br/>\nmaple syrup, but corn syrup has none of those benefits and a high gi <br/>\nto boot. The more processed a sugar is, the more healthful compounds <br/>\nare taken out.<br/>\nSo there&#39;s a lot more to it than just what it ends up being at the <br/>\nend of the process. How hard your body has to work to make it become <br/>\nglucose affects more than you think. If your body has to dump a ton <br/>\nof insulin to get the desired result, it&#39;s a lot harder on your body.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":146409249,"authorName":"glad2bmadly","from":"glad2bmadly &lt;glad2bmadly@...&gt;","profile":"glad2bmadly","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Sugar allergy questions...showing my ignorance??","postDate":"1056761819","msgId":75648,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwNjI4MDA1NjU5Ljc2NDE4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQyMDAxLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJkaW4zMCtxbnRzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":75647,"nextInTopic":75652,"prevInTime":75647,"nextInTime":75649,"topicId":75647,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I hope you get a reply from a more scientific mind with a better memory for facts than mine but I do know that yes there are a lot of chemicals in processed","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1667019254\">I hope you get a reply from a more scientific mind with a better memory for facts than mine but I do know that yes there are a lot of chemicals in processed white sugar that cause a lot of reactions in children especially (not that mine don&#39;t eat it) and that sugar in it&#39;s processed form is chemically much different than the sugar that results from other foods naturally breaking down in your body.  <br/>\n<br/>\nmomo3kaj &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott-wecht@...\">scott-wecht@...</a>&gt; wrote:I thought that all our food was processed to sugar in the C6H12O6 form<br/>\nfor cellular energy/function.
