The basic plan is to eliminate all artifical colors, flavors and <br/>\npreservatives and, for the first four weeks, all natural salycalites  (apples, grapes, <br/>\noranges, etc.).  It&#39;s hard at first and feels just so restrictive that it <br/>\ndrives you crazy.  But knowing that diet can help my son to feel better is worth <br/>\nit.  He used to have major meltdowns daily that lasted for an hour or two.  Now, <br/>\nhe still gets upset - what 4 year old doesn&#39;t - but he can work through it <br/>\nand get over it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday he had some Wendy&#39;s chicken nuggets and french fries after a <br/>\nbrownie and frozen waffle.  He felt like he was crawling out of his skin all day.  <br/>\n&quot;Too many chemicals, Mommy.&quot;  I think of the past month as a detox and now we <br/>\nwill be more careful what he eats.  He&#39;s been very involved in the whole <br/>\nprocess and likes being the way he is now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be way off the mark for your situation, but I thought I&#39;d share.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8226888,"authorName":"Robin Clevenger","from":"&quot;Robin Clevenger&quot; &lt;diamondair@...&gt;","profile":"the_clevengers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: Need suggestions for dealing with distressed child","postDate":"1053841576","msgId":70656,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTMtREFWMTU0MVRiZGtTbUwwMDAwMDAzZEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwNTM4MjkzNzcuMTk3OC4xMDQ2OS5tOEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70644,"nextInTopic":71046,"prevInTime":70655,"nextInTime":70657,"topicId":70602,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: Robyn Coburn  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-332321103\">From: &quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dezigna@...\">dezigna@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I thought that he might be having a reaction to some things he had<br/>\neaten (he&#39;s really sensitive to certain chemicals) and tried to get Alex<br/>\nto take some anti-histamine&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe behavior you describe sounds *exactly* like my son if he gets any dairy<br/>\nin his system. He will get so manic, he&#39;ll throw himself against walls, run<br/>\naround in circles, break down weeping and screaming, etc. It&#39;s really<br/>\nfrightening, both to watch as a parent and feel helpless, and for him being<br/>\ninside of it and not knowing how to handle it. When it happens now, I just<br/>\ntake a deep breath, say to myself &quot;There&#39;s nothing he can do about this,<br/>\nhe&#39;s as scared and upset about this as I am&quot;, and just try and do as best as<br/>\nI can to keep him from hurting himself or others. I hold him if he wants<br/>\nholding, or try to give him options to help equalize the feelings he&#39;s<br/>\nhaving (safe things to bash on, like a big plastic baseball bat he can slam<br/>\nagainst a tree, or something similar), give him deep pressure squeezes if he<br/>\nwants that (sometimes it helps him feel more organized inside). I tell<br/>\nmyself that this will pass, and it always does. Fortunately, now that we&#39;ve<br/>\nidentified the triggers, eliminated most of the allergies that cause it via<br/>\nNAET (www.naet.com) and avoid the one that we haven&#39;t been able to eliminate<br/>\n(dairy), this happens very infrequently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my best suggestions are to do your best to identify and either avoid<br/>\nor fix the allergic reactions that are happening for him. Once you do that,<br/>\nthis kind of day should be very rare and you can recognize it for what it<br/>\nis. When it happens, cancel all plans, remind yourself of the things that<br/>\nare important, and buckle in for the ride. Just try and help him through it.<br/>\nAfterwards, you can talk to him about it and help him understand what is<br/>\nhappening inside him. I know my son really hates the way it feels and he<br/>\nhates being out of control, so it really helps him if I just remind him that<br/>\nit is not his &quot;fault&quot; and that it will pass, it *will* be over. He knows<br/>\nthat I&#39;m on his side and not blaming him or trying to make him feel bad for<br/>\nanything. Mostly, like I said, I just have to make sure he doesn&#39;t hurt<br/>\nhimself or others (once, he almost managed to break through a window with<br/>\nhis body, he slammed into it so hard &lt;shudder&gt; ).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re concerned about how to approach this respectfully, just think<br/>\nabout how you&#39;d want to be treated if you had some kind of fit and a friend<br/>\nwas present. How could they best help you? It *is* hard to go through this.<br/>\nMake sure you are not around unsupportive people in this kind of time,<br/>\nbecause you sure don&#39;t need the extra stress of dealing with that, and<br/>\nneither does the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":147376218,"authorName":"liza sabater","from":"liza sabater &lt;listdiva@...&gt;","profile":"lm_sabater","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Need suggestions for dealing with distressed child","postDate":"1053826189","msgId":70644,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYwOEQxMURBLThFNTAtMTFENy1BMTNFLTAwMDM5M0I4NEZCNkBjdWx0dXJla2l0Y2hlbi5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGJhbzNoaCtoMzBnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70627,"nextInTopic":70656,"prevInTime":70643,"nextInTime":70645,"topicId":70602,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All, Time to jump in.

That used to happen to <br/>\nmy Evan, who was consistently colicky until 6-8 months and <br/>\nintermittently until he was about 2 years old. Even these days (he <br/>\nturns 6 in August), when he is in a crabby mood and throwing tantrums <br/>\nfor no reason, I know it has to do more with a physical reaction than <br/>\nan emotional need.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow have I handled outbursts? He is not a hitter but he will throw <br/>\nhimself on the floor and in the process he has hurt himself. When he <br/>\nwas 3, I would just sit on the floor and hold him. By then, though, we <br/>\nwere on the right track, identifying all his allergies (17 markers) and <br/>\nmaking changes to our health care options. We use homeopathy and <br/>\nchiropractic medicine to deal with his allergies, eczema, asthma and <br/>\nirritable bowel syndrome. We use conventional allopathic drugs when the <br/>\nallergens (especially environmental ones like pollen or dust) are so <br/>\nbad that nothing works.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was that little, after the episode, we would &#39;review&#39; it. We <br/>\nwould talk about what he went through and try to find the words to <br/>\ndescribe it. I remember being surprised by Evan&#39;s first own description <br/>\nof a throat infection --he described it as having a sandshrew stuck in <br/>\nhis throat (for all you Pokemon fans, guess which episode that <br/>\nreference comes from). Given the colic hell we lived through his first <br/>\n2 years of life, I have to say that his explanation was like winning <br/>\nthe lottery. There is nothing more depressing than to have your baby <br/>\nscreaming to the top of his lungs and not knowing how to help them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo see if you can talk about the incident with him. It actually has <br/>\nbeen one of the most empowering things for Evan --to be able to explain <br/>\nwhat he is going through so that we can figure out what caused the <br/>\ndistress. Because once he knows the cause, then he can control the <br/>\npotential reaction. He is not anymore at the mercy of unknowns <br/>\nattacking his body.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nl i z a<br/>\n==============================<br/>\nwww.culturekitchen.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":105774918,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Need suggestions for dealing with distressed child","postDate":"1053804403","msgId":70627,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMzMjIyYSQ2YzBlMTk2MCQzNDAwYThjMEByb2J5bm1hY2hpbmU+","inReplyToHeader":"PGJhbzNoaCtoMzBnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70617,"nextInTopic":70644,"prevInTime":70626,"nextInTime":70628,"topicId":70602,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-539396998\">&lt;&lt;I thought that he might be having a reaction to some things he had<br/>\neaten (he&#39;s really sensitive to certain chemicals) and tried to get Alex<br/>\nto take some anti-histamine&gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nYou may have hit the nail on the head for the cause if it was a sudden<br/>\nchange in behavior.

I don&#39;t know what we would do<br/>\nif it were some serious issue that needed the medicine. Probably end up<br/>\nhaving to insist, as you did. Sometimes with ointments Jayn refuses, but<br/>\nif I sit quietly and wait, without comments or cajoling, after a few<br/>\nminutes she says, &quot;I&#39;m ready now&quot;. Again, I&#39;m not sure this would have<br/>\napplied in your situation with the wildness. It seems like he may have<br/>\nforgotten and forgiven.

I&#39;d be<br/>\ninterested to know if you are able to track it down. BTW did the<br/>\nantihistamine help or have no effect? That would be a clue.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if it occurs again and were possible, take him somewhere where he<br/>\ncould really run, a large park or field; perhaps he needed the physical<br/>\nresponse to help get the &quot;contaminant&quot; out of his system.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Need suggestions for dealing with distressed child","postDate":"1053795243","msgId":70617,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI2LjM5ZGMyNGUwLjJjMDBmZGFiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70602,"nextInTopic":70627,"prevInTime":70616,"nextInTime":70618,"topicId":70602,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My thoughts on the diaper situation: Why make him put it on right then?
