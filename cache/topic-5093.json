We&#39;ve told and<br/>\nretold it in my household since the kids were small, and we&#39;ve also<br/>\nturned it into a puppet theatre production.  So we&#39;ll tell it again<br/>\ntomorrow night. Here goes:<br/>\n                          ANOTHER CHANUKAH STORY<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce upon a time and space -- for a time without a space is like a nose<br/>\nwithout a face -- at the far northern edge of the town, which was at the<br/>\nfar northern edge of the county, which was at the far northern end of<br/>\nthe country, at the far northern edge of the continent, at the far<br/>\nnorthern end of the northernmost world, there lived a very poor family<br/>\nconsisting of a mother, a father, eight children (4 boys and 4 girls),<br/>\nand an old cow.  In the cold, northern winters they didn&#39;t have much to<br/>\neat, or enough fuel for the fire to keep warm, and they couldn&#39;t afford<br/>\nelectricity.  Still, they were happy enough, and kept themselves happy<br/>\nby singing together every evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne cold and windy day in darkest December, the youngest daughter met an<br/>\nold, shrivelled woman at the northern end of the town square.   The old<br/>\nwoman was wearing a tattered dark brown cloak that covered her whole<br/>\nbody and which she drew up over her head.  The old woman complained that<br/>\nshe had no place to stay and nothing to eat.  &quot;Come home with me,&quot; said<br/>\nthe girl, &quot;we don&#39;t have much, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll share what we have.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so they went home together.  The family welcomed the old woman, even<br/>\nthough there wasn&#39;t much in the pantry to eat.  (In fact, they were so<br/>\npoor, they didn&#39;t even have a pantry.)  They had a bunch of potatoes<br/>\nwhich had lots of black spots in them, so they cut out the black spots<br/>\nand made potato pancakes.  They had a bag of wormy apples, so they cut<br/>\nout the worms and made applesauce.  The old cow gave nothing but sour<br/>\nmilk, so with their potato pancakes and applesauce they had sour cream.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt gets dark early in deep December and the house had no electricity, so<br/>\nthe father went to the candle box, but found only one small candle<br/>\nleft.  The father lit the last candle, and the family gathered around<br/>\nthe table to sing songs for the old woman, and also for themselves.<br/>\nThey music was beautiful, and somehow the light of the candle seemed<br/>\nbrighter as the family sang.  Soon, one by one, first the children, and<br/>\nthen the mother and father drifted off to sleep in the old family bed,<br/>\nwhere they huddled together with the old cow to keep warm.  The old<br/>\nwoman slept in the old armchair by the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day when they got up, they were all surprised to see that the<br/>\ncandle was still lit.  In the evening, they gathered together again to<br/>\neat their dinner of potato pancakes and applesauce and sour cream, and<br/>\nto sing songs around the table.  And as the singing seemed to get more<br/>\nand more beautiful, the old woman seemed less shrivelled.  And people<br/>\nbegan to gather outside to hear the singing, their noses pressed against<br/>\nthe one small window.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so it went.  Every evening, the family ate their poor dinner of<br/>\npotato pancakes and applesauce and sour cream, and sang around the<br/>\ntable, their faces and the one small candle still shining brightly.  And<br/>\nthe crowds around the window grew larger and larger.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the eighth day, there was a knock on the door.  It was Mayor Mayer<br/>\n(the mayor of the town) who, having heard and liked the singing so much,<br/>\noffered the family a job singing at city hall.  But at that, the old<br/>\nwoman stood up and took off her tattered cloak.  Underneath she was<br/>\nwearing a robe made of gold.  She reached into her pocket and took out a<br/>\nsmall crown of rich red rubies and placed it on the little girl&#39;s head,<br/>\nand out of her cloak she brought a bale of fresh green grass for the old<br/>\ncow.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I was hungry and tired and you took me in,&quot; she said, &quot;and it gave you<br/>\nsuch joy to do it.  I have a castle where any tired travellers, rich or<br/>\npoor, can stop and have a meal and spend the night.  And since you have<br/>\nbeen able to make the poorest fare seem like a feast, I want you to come<br/>\nto my castle and take charge of the food, and the singing, and the<br/>\nhospitality.  And bring the cow!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they did.  And to this day we celebrate the family which made a<br/>\nfeast out of the poorest fare of potato pancakes and applesauce, and the<br/>\ncow who could only give sour milk, and the one small candle which stayed<br/>\nlit for eight days by the light of their singing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        -- David H.
