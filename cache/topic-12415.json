Her<br/>\nweb site is www.awareparenting.com.<br/>\nPersonally I cringe every time someone talks about how they think there is a<br/>\nplace for spanking.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing are some samples of Aletha&#39;s work. I am sorry, if this is too long<br/>\nfor some of you, but I feel so passionate about this. I just can&#39;t help<br/>\nmyself; I have to get this information out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t hit children! I may be overstepping some boundaries here, but I<br/>\nhappen to believe that all children are all adults&#39; responsibility, not just<br/>\nthe parents&#39;; now more so than ever, because since the decline of villages<br/>\nand the extended family, couples are pretty much raising children in<br/>\nisolation, even if they have some sort of &quot;village&quot; around them. I believe<br/>\none of the purposes for having a village for raising a child is to prevent<br/>\nabuse, such as spanking, by giving parents the option for taking a break<br/>\nwhen things get too intense and overwhelming.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just me and my personal opinion. Take it or leave it.<br/>\nNicoletta<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTWENTY ALTERNATIVES TO PUNISHMENT<br/>\n<br/>\n1. LOOK FOR UNDERLYING NEEDS. ex: Give your child something to play with<br/>\nwhile waiting in line.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. GIVE INFORMATION & REASONS. ex: If your child colours on the wall,<br/>\nexplain why we colour on paper only.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. LOOK FOR UNDERLYING FEELINGS. Acknowledge, accept & listen to feelings.<br/>\nex: If your child hits his baby sister, encourage him to express his anger<br/>\nand jealousy in harmless ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT. This is sometimes easier than trying to change<br/>\nthe child. ex: If your child repeatedly takes things out of the kitchen<br/>\ncupboards, put a childproof lock on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. FIND ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVES, and redirect your child&#39;s behaviour. ex: If<br/>\nyou do not want your child to build a fort in the dining room, don&#39;t just<br/>\nsay no. Tell her where she can build one.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. DEMONSTRATE HOW YOU WANT YOUR CHILD TO BEHAVE. ex. If your child pulls a<br/>\ncat&#39;s tail, show her how to pet a cat. Do not rely on words alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. GIVE CHOICES RATHER THAN COMMANDS. Decision-making empowers children;<br/>\ncommands invite a power struggle. ex: &#39;Would you like to brush your teeth<br/>\nbefore or after putting your pyjamas on?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n8. MAKE SMALL CONCESSIONS. ex: &quot;I&#39;ll let you skip brushing your teeth<br/>\ntonight because you are so tired.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n9. PROVIDE FOR A PERIOD OF PREPARATION. ex: If you are counting on company<br/>\nfor dinner, tell your child how you expect him to behave. Be specific.<br/>\nRole-playing can help prepare children for potentially difficult situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. LET NATURAL CONSEQUENCES OCCUR (when appropriate). Don&#39;t rescue too<br/>\nmuch. ex: A child who does not hang up her bathing suit and towel may find<br/>\nthem still wet the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\n11. USE ACTIONS WHEN NECESSARY. If your child insists on running across<br/>\nstreets on your walks together, hold his hand tightly (while explaining the<br/>\ndangers).<br/>\n<br/>\n12. GIVE &#39;I-MESSAGES&#39;. ex: &quot;I get so tired of cleaning up crumbs in the<br/>\nliving room.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n13. HOLD YOUR CHILD. This expression of love enables children who are acting<br/>\naggressively or obnoxiously to channel their pent-up feelings into healing<br/>\ntears.<br/>\n<br/>\n14. REMOVE YOUR CHILD FROM THE SITUATION, AND STAY WITH HER until she is<br/>\nready to act appropriately. Use the time for listening, sharing feelings,<br/>\nand moving toward conflict- resolution.<br/>\n<br/>\n15. BE PLAYFUL. Turn the situation into a game. ex: &#39;Let&#39;s pretend we&#39;re the<br/>\nseven dwarfs while we clean up.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n16. DO IT TOGETHER. ex: If your child refuses to take a bath, offer to take<br/>\none with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n17. MAKE A DEAL, NEGOTIATE. ex: If you&#39;re ready to leave the playground and<br/>\nyour child is having fun, reach an agreement on the number of times she may<br/>\ngo down the slide before leaving.<br/>\n<br/>\n18. DEFUSE THE SITUATION WITH LAUGHTER. ex: If your child is mad at you,<br/>\ninvite him to express his anger in a playful pillow fight with you. Play<br/>\nyour part by surrendering dramatically. Laughter helps resolve anger and<br/>\nfeelings of powerlessness.<br/>\n<br/>\n19. REVISE YOUR EXPECTATIONS. Young children are naturally loud, curious,<br/>\nmessy, wilful, impatient, demanding, forgetful, fearful, self-centred, and<br/>\nfull of energy. Try to accept them as they are.<br/>\n<br/>\n20. TAKE A PARENTAL TIME-OUT. Leave the room, and do whatever is needed to<br/>\nregain your sense of composure and good judgement (ex: cry, call a friend,<br/>\nmeditate, take a shower, ad a poem).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1992 by Aletha Solter.

No part of this article may be<br/>\nreproduced, electronically or mechanically, without written permission from<br/>\nthe author. This article was originally published in Mothering magazine in<br/>\nthe Fall issue of 1992. It was revised and updated in 2000.<br/>\nAs concerned parents and educators have become aware of the dangers of<br/>\nphysical punishment, time-out has emerged as a popular disciplinary tool.<br/>\nMisbehaving children are told to sit quietly on a chair or go to their rooms<br/>\nto calm down and think about what they did. After a period of time, they are<br/>\nallowed to come back to the group or join the family, provided that they act<br/>\n&quot;appropriately.&quot; The designated period of time is usually one minute per<br/>\nyear of age, and children who leave the chair or room before their time is<br/>\nup are told to return for the full allotment once again. Some books<br/>\nrecommend an added rule of silence, and suggest that the timing be repeated<br/>\nif the silence is broken. In either case, parents who use this method are<br/>\npromised quick and easy results.<br/>\nTime-out stems from the behaviorist movement based on the work of<br/>\npsychologist B.F. Skinner. His theory of operant conditioning asserts that<br/>\nchildren will behave in certain ways if they receive rewards for doing so<br/>\n(&quot;positive reinforcement&quot;), and that undesirable behavior can be diminished<br/>\nby withholding the rewards or by invoking pain (both of which are termed<br/>\n&quot;punishment&quot;). Skinner himself believed that all forms of punishment were<br/>\nunsuitable means of controlling children&#39;s behavior [1]. Even so, while<br/>\nspanking is on the wane in the United States, the withholding of love and<br/>\nattention has persisted as an acceptable means of control.<br/>\nBeneath the Surface<br/>\nUsing time-out appears less injurious than hitting, spanking, or yelling,<br/>\nbecause it does not involve physical or verbal abuse. It is therefore<br/>\nthought to represent some degree of progress in our continual striving to<br/>\nmake this world a better place for children. According to many educators and<br/>\npsychologists, however, time-out is not as innocent as it seems and is,<br/>\nmoreover, an emotionally harmful way to discipline children. In fact, the<br/>\nNational Association for the Education of Young Children includes the use of<br/>\ntime-out in a list of harmful disciplinary measures, along with physical<br/>\npunishment, criticizing, blaming, and shaming [2].<br/>\nBeneath the surface, time-out is an authoritarian approach and, as such, can<br/>\nwork only among children trained to comply with the power and authority of<br/>\nadults. Children trained to conform to such measures know that the<br/>\nconsequences of disobeying are worse than adhering to the injunctions.<br/>\nChildren who have not been brought up in an authoritarian environment will<br/>\nmost likely refuse to go to another room or sit in a chair.<br/>\nHow does a child learn about the consequences of disobedience? Proponents of<br/>\ntime-out advise parents to remove all privileges such as TV, toys, music,<br/>\nand so forth until compliance has been achieved. Always there is the threat<br/>\nof deprivation or further penalty. In some families there may even be an<br/>\nunspoken threat of violence. Although the method seems innocent enough, it<br/>\nrequires a past history of punitive authoritarianism to produce children<br/>\ndocile enough to obey.<br/>\nProponents claim that time-out is not a form of punishment. They use terms<br/>\nsuch as &quot;consequence,&quot; &quot;renewal time,&quot; or &quot;down time&quot; to make the approach<br/>\nsound benign. The term &quot;time-out&quot; itself has pleasant connotations of a<br/>\nsports team taking a well-deserved break. Regrettably, this non-threatening<br/>\nterminology has deluded parents into thinking that the approach is harmless.<br/>\nFrom a child&#39;s point of view, time-out is definitely experienced as<br/>\npunishment. Who wants to be isolated from the group and totally ignored? It<br/>\nis quite likely that children view this form of isolation as abandonment and<br/>\nloss of love. And while parents are often careful to provide reassurances of<br/>\ntheir love and to distinguish between the child and the unruly behavior (&quot;I<br/>\nlove you, but you need to go to your room for five minutes because what you<br/>\ndid is not acceptable&quot;), their actions speak much louder than their words.<br/>\nChildren under the age of seven simply do not have the capability to process<br/>\nwords in the same way that adults do [3]. Concrete experience and<br/>\nperceptions of reality impact more strongly than language. Being isolated<br/>\nand ignored is interpreted as &quot;Nobody wants to be with me right now.<br/>\nTherefore I must be bad and unlovable,&quot; and no loving words, however well<br/>\nintended, can override this feeling of rejection.<br/>\nNothing is more frightening for a child than the withdrawal of love. Along<br/>\nwith the fear come insecurity, anxiety, confusion, anger, resentment, and<br/>\nlow self-esteem. Time-out can also cause embarrassment and humiliation,<br/>\nespecially when used in the presence of other children. In the child&#39;s realm<br/>\nof experience, time-out is nothing short of punitive.<br/>\nPainful feelings are one consideration; the information conveyed about human<br/>\nrelationships is another. What message are we giving our children in<br/>\ndemonstrating that love and attention are commodities to be doled out or<br/>\nwithheld for purposes of controlling others? Is this a conflict-resolution<br/>\nskill that will be useful to them? How will it influence their ability to<br/>\ninteract with friends, and some day with a spouse and coworkers? Wouldn&#39;t it<br/>\nbe better to teach children useful conflict-resolution skills right from the<br/>\nstart, rather than convey the message that the only way to solve conflicts<br/>\nis to cut off communication?<br/>\nAlthough the trouble with time-out is in large part invisible, one aspect is<br/>\nglaringly obvious: at some point it stops working. Proponents of the<br/>\napproach admit that it is effective only up until the age of about nine. Can<br/>\nyou imagine telling your teenager, who may be taller than you, to sit in a<br/>\nchair while you ignore him? Teens who have any sense of their own self-worth<br/>\nwill laugh at such a command. The adolescent version of time-out is the<br/>\npractice of &quot;grounding&quot; teenagers by not allowing them to go out on the<br/>\nweekends or in the evenings. But this method only leads to resentment,<br/>\nresistance, and sometimes even lying.<br/>\nIndeed, any method based on power and authoritarianism must eventually be<br/>\nabandoned, simply because parents run out of power [4]. Parents of teens<br/>\nface an entirely new set of difficulties when their tried-and-true methods<br/>\nof control prove utterly ineffective. Parents who adopt non-authoritarian<br/>\nmethods right from the start, on the other hand, are able to prevent the<br/>\npower struggles, as well as the discipline problems, that so often come with<br/>\nadolescence.<br/>\nHidden Consequences<br/>\nThe use of time-out leads to a host of hidden problems. For one, when we<br/>\nenforce a time-out for children who are crying or raging, they get the<br/>\nmessage that we do not want to be around them when they are upset. Certain<br/>\nthat we will not listen, they may soon stop bringing their problems to us.<br/>\nFurthermore, such children may learn to suppress their feelings, especially<br/>\nif we insist on time-out in silence. Have we forgotten that crying and<br/>\nraging are healthy tension-release mechanisms that help relieve sadness and<br/>\nfrustration? [5,6,7] Have we ignored the research showing that stress<br/>\nhormones are excreted through tears, thereby possibly reducing the effects<br/>\nof stress and restoring the body&#39;s chemical balance? [8]. In teaching our<br/>\nchildren to suppress their tears, we may actually be increasing their<br/>\nsusceptibility to a variety of emotional and physical imbalances. Swiss<br/>\npsychotherapist Dr. Alice Miller states that one of the most devastating<br/>\nthings we do to children is deny them the freedom to express their anger and<br/>\nsuffering [9].<br/>\nAn additional problem is that the use of time-out does not address the<br/>\nunderlying cause of the &quot;inappropriate behavior.&quot; Children act in specific<br/>\nways for good reasons, even though the youngsters themselves may not be<br/>\naware of them. Most undesirable behavior can be explained by one of three<br/>\nfactors: the child is attempting to fulfill a legitimate need, the child<br/>\nlacks information or is too young to understand, or the child is feeling<br/>\nupset (frustrated, sad, scared, confused, jealous, or insecure) [10]. When<br/>\nwe try to change a behavior without addressing these feelings and needs, we<br/>\ndo not help our children very much at all. Why? Because the underlying<br/>\nproblem will still be there. Teaching children to conform to our wishes does<br/>\nnot resolve the deeper issues.<br/>\nFor example, siblings who are repeatedly separated and sent to their rooms<br/>\nwhen they fight may eventually learn to stop fighting in front of their<br/>\nparents. Their unresolved feelings of jealousy and hatred, however, may come<br/>\nto expression in more devious ways, or they may carry their resentments into<br/>\nadulthood. Curtailing the symptoms of a problem does not solve the problem.<br/>\nParents have been led to believe that children will use time-out to think<br/>\nabout what they did and regain some modicum of self-control. In reality,<br/>\nwhen children act in inappropriate, aggressive, or obnoxious ways, they are<br/>\noften harboring such strong pent-up feelings that they are unable to think<br/>\nclearly about their actions. Far more helpful than isolation is an attentive<br/>\nlistener who can encourage the expression of honest feelings. The healthy<br/>\nrelease provided by talking, crying, or raging may even prevent the<br/>\nrecurrence of unwanted behavior.<br/>\nHolding children who hit or bite is much more effective than isolating them.<br/>\nFirm but loving holding creates safety and warmth while protecting other<br/>\nchildren from getting hurt. It also invites the expression of genuine<br/>\nfeelings (through crying and raging) while reassuring the child of the<br/>\nindestructible parent-child bond. [10]. It is paradoxical, yet true:<br/>\nchildren are most in need of loving attention when they act least deserving<br/>\nof it. Telling a violent child to sit quietly rarely accomplishes anything<br/>\nconstructive and only further contributes to the child&#39;s pent-up anger and<br/>\nfeelings of alienation.<br/>\nIt is not necessary to isolate children and withdraw our love to teach them<br/>\nhow to &quot;behave&quot;. In fact, it is entirely possible to help children learn to<br/>\nbe cooperative and decent members of society without ever issuing<br/>\npunishments, rewards, or artificial consequences of any kind. No quick and<br/>\neasy method will solve every conflict. Instead, we need to treat each<br/>\nsituation as the unique challenge that it is, and try to be flexible and<br/>\ncreative, all the while giving our children the love and respect they<br/>\ndeserve.<br/>\nNotes<br/>\n1.

Aware parents fill their children&#39;s needs for physical contact (holding,<br/>\ncuddling, etc.). They do not worry about &quot;spoiling&#39; their children.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Aware parents accept the entire range of emotions and listen<br/>\nnon-judgmentally to children&#39;s expressions of feelings. They realize that<br/>\nthey cannot prevent all sadness, anger, or frustration, and they do not<br/>\nattempt to stop children from releasing painful feelings through crying or<br/>\nraging.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Aware parents offer age-appropriate stimulation, and trust children to<br/>\nlearn at their own rate and in their own way. They do not try to hurry<br/>\nchildren on to new stages of development.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Aware parents offer encouragement for learning new skills, but do not<br/>\njudge children&#39;s performance with either criticism or evaluative praise.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Aware parents spend time each day giving full attention to their<br/>\nchildren. During this special, quality time, they observe, listen, respond,<br/>\nand join in their children&#39;s play (if invited to do so), but they do not<br/>\ndirect the children&#39;s activities.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Aware parents protect children from danger, but they do not attempt to<br/>\nprevent all of their children&#39;s mistakes, problems, or conflicts.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Aware parents encourage children to be autonomous problem-solvers and<br/>\nhelp only when needed. They do not solve their children&#39;s problems for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Aware parents set reasonable boundaries and limits, gently guide children<br/>\ntowards acceptable behavior, and consider everyone&#39;s needs when solving<br/>\nconflicts. They do not control children with bribes, rewards, threats, or<br/>\npunishments of any kind.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Aware parents take care of themselves and are honest about their own<br/>\nneeds and feelings. They do not sacrifice themselves to the point of<br/>\nbecoming resentful.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Aware parents strive to be aware of the ways in which their own<br/>\nchildhood pain interferes with their ability to be good parents, and they<br/>\nmake conscious efforts to avoid passing on their own hurts to their<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis philosophy is further developed in Aletha Solter&#39;s books, The Aware<br/>\nBaby, Helping Young Children Flourish, and Tears and Tantrums (available<br/>\nfrom Shining Star Press, P.O.
