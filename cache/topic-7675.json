I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2090889160\">Melanie,<br/>\nI make soap using vegetable shortening and lye.  It&#39;s the easiest recipe<br/>\nI&#39;ve found and I&#39;ve never had a problem with saponification or<br/>\nseperation.  I don&#39;t use essential oils or fragrance mainly because I<br/>\ncan&#39;t find them anywhere.  They&#39;re too expensive for me to order<br/>\nonline.  They might have instructions on the oils for usuage.  The<br/>\nfollowing is the best web site I&#39;ve come across when it comes to soap<br/>\nmaking.  Very helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.silverlink.net/~timer/soapinfo.html\">http://www.silverlink.net/~timer/soapinfo.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJoy<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vouget@...\">vouget@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, we&#39;re kinda settled in.  I&#39;m just reading messages on the website<br/>\n&gt; - I don&#39;t have time to get everything yet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; NEwayz, my son and I are going to try to make soap.  But, I do not<br/>\n&gt; have access to any books on soap making (I can&#39;t read Japanese very<br/>\n&gt; well - and they don&#39;t have any soap making books in English at the<br/>\n&gt; library), and we can&#39;t order anything on the web without paying $50+-<br/>\n&gt; for shipping - which takes about a month anywayz.  SO, I know the<br/>\n&gt; basics - like add lye to heated vegetable oil (I think I&#39;ll use<br/>\n&gt; grapeseed) and when it starts to thicken, add fragrance (I&#39;m going to<br/>\n&gt; use a few essential oils), but I don&#39;t know how much to add, and hear<br/>\n&gt; that could be dangerous.  So, if anyone knows the details - have<br/>\n&gt; experience with adding essential oils, etc. please e-mail me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Melanie in Japan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; LOW RATE, NO WAIT!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
