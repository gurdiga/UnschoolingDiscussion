Then just ask them to show you where in <br/>\nthe settlement it says that such-and-such purchases do not qualify <br/>\nfor the 30% discount, which is to be in addition to any other <br/>\nadvertised discounts, by the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the K-B web site with the full details on this suit and <br/>\nsettlement:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/qawc\">http://tinyurl.com/qawc</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here is the K-B Toys store locator site:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www3.kbkids.com/STATES/storfind8.htm\">http://www3.kbkids.com/STATES/storfind8.htm</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, kids, how do we figure percent?
