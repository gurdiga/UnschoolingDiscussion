I&#39;m coming back because I am looking for<br/>\nwriters. I would like to have homeschoolers opinion pieces about<br/>\npolitical issues affection homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy site is being tracked by the Washington Post as a political blog to<br/>\nread throughout the elections. I am opening my blog to other writers,<br/>\nespecially homeschoolers because, as far as I know, NOT ONE POLITICAL<br/>\nBLOG is covering anything about homeschooling issues. This is your<br/>\nopportunity people. Sieze it! <br/>\n<br/>\nFYI : I am an unapologetic progressive, some say to the left of<br/>\nliberal. I am also an atheist. At my site I once in a while use<br/>\nlanguage that some would find offensive. If you have a problem with<br/>\nthis, this is not the forum for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I am open to post both liberal and conservative homeschooling<br/>\npolitical POVs because, at the moment, there are NONE whatsoever in<br/>\nthe national political discussion; even less so in reference to the<br/>\nelections. <br/>\n<br/>\nSubjects I am looking for : <br/>\n<br/>\nNCLBA; especially Bush&#39;s opinion that it is a &quot;jobs program&quot;<br/>\nCompulsory education laws<br/>\nAccountability<br/>\nIndependent learning movement vs. Homeschooling<br/>\nSchooling vs. Learning<br/>\nCyberschools / Cybercharters / Homeschooling<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is anything else you feel needs to be addressed that I have<br/>\nomitted from this paltry list, please feel free to send it in. Hotly<br/>\ncontested states like PA, OH, FL, please speak up! <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have only 3 weeks to have your voice heard before the elections.<br/>\nIf you write for an e-list such as this one, you can write for a blog.<br/>\nWord count does not matter either, as long as you can make your point<br/>\nclearly. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease remember that many people coming to the site might not know<br/>\nmuch about homeschooling. Your opinions have to be educational and<br/>\ninformative as well. Links to sources over the net or books about the<br/>\nsubjects you are writing about are an absolute must. Also include a<br/>\nsmall bio about yourself and links to any websites, blogs or<br/>\nYahoo!Groups where readers can find you. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respect do not respond to this list (this is a list about<br/>\ndiscussion Unschooling after all). Send all your submissions to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:liza@...\">liza@...</a>. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\nLiza Sabater<br/>\nwww.culturekitchen.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100639,"nextTopicId":100668}}
