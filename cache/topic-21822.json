If it is reasonable to say that you can<br/>\ntransmit basic literacy and math skills within about 50 hours, why are there<br/>\nso<br/>\nmany illiterate adults out there? Do they just not want to learn?  I am in<br/>\ntotal<br/>\nagreement with everything everyone has stated about late reading, but this<br/>\njust<br/>\npopped into my mind. This is not a condemning question.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\nIn my opinion, there are so many illiterate adults because schools try to<br/>\nforce a one-sized-fits-all curriculum on children. I think that is the<br/>\nentire reason that there are adults we all know who hate reading, are afraid<br/>\nof math, do not comprehend basic scientific principles, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Book of Learning and Forgetting by Frank Smith he writes about how<br/>\ntrue learning happens, and that it isn&#39;t always positive. Many, many<br/>\nchildren learn, very well, that reading or math or science or pull-ups are<br/>\nimpossible and incomprehensible to them. They don&#39;t forget it, even when<br/>\nthey&#39;re all grown up, even if people around them are assuring them it&#39;s not<br/>\ntrue.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21824,"nextTopicId":22013}}
