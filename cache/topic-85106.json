We spent six weeks living with my SIL in Georgia until housing was available in FL. During that time Sarah slept in a bed with me. So when we got our household goods, she no longer wanted to sleep in her crib. All we had for her to sleep on for about a year was a large queen sized air mattress. She loved it! She had all the room she needed to roll around in her sleep (she&#39;s a rough sleeper like me). It was comfortable to her. It was the only period in her life until she was 6 that she would just take herself to go to sleep when she was tired and lay down on her bed. That&#39;s not including a period when she was 3 in which she preferred to sleep on the living room couch for about 3 months.<br/>\n <br/>\nOur two year old, Megan, has slept on the couch since this past summer when she was seriously ill. We have no intention of forcing her back into her bed. She&#39;s comfy where she is.<br/>\n <br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\nsonyacurti &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcurtielectric@...\">jcurtielectric@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nHi Tia,<br/>\nI just want you to know that you are not alone.<br/>\nI have a 7 year old son who sleeps on an air mattress at the foot of <br/>\nour bed in our (mine and my husbands)room.
