One thing I have done (not sure if it&#39;s <br/>\navailable in your area) is shop online. There is a grocery store about 35 <br/>\nminutes from me that will do your shopping and bring the bags out to your <br/>\ncar. You just make your order online and drive up to the store and give <br/>\nthem your credit card. This even helps *me* to resist temptation that is <br/>\nall over the mainstream stores. We get our meat from a delivery service and <br/>\ngo to a whole food store, then other items we get with the online shopping.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Do or do not. There is no try.&quot;<br/>\n-- Yoda<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon Entin, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:entinfamily@...\">entinfamily@...</a><br/>\nLow Carb Living, Scrapbooking & Homeschooling at www.ShannonEntin.com<br/>\nFamily updates at www.TheEntins.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102576,"nextTopicId":102553}}
