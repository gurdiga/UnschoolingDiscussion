I wanted to share. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe need to pull up our kitchen floor, and as I was folding laundry <br/>\nshe wanted me to play with her.  I told her as soon as I finished <br/>\nworking I would, and that if she wanted she could help me pull up <br/>\nthe floor.  &quot;Only if I want to?&quot; she asked.  I said yes, that if she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to she could play instead, and she said, &quot;Oh, good.  I <br/>\nonly wanted to help if I didn&#39;t have to unless I wanted to.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nLater she came into the room where I was working and said, &quot;I have <br/>\nthree special stickers Mommy.  I&#39;m going to tell you about them.  On <br/>\nthis hand is a heart, because you should always love your children.  <br/>\nOn this hand is a flower, because you should always smell flowers <br/>\nbefore you pick them. (Nobody&#39;s ever said this to her as far as I <br/>\nknow.)  And on my forehead is a smiley face, because you should <br/>\nalways smile at your children, even when you&#39;re angry.&quot;  Afully good <br/>\nparenting advice, I thought!<br/>\n<br/>\nKristi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35860,"nextTopicId":95704}}
