Mr. Berry feels<br/>\n&gt;&gt;homeschooling should not be legal - and his view of homeschoolers is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;unfortunately as limited and uninformed as that of many of our<br/>\n&gt;&gt;legislators.  We need better - and more accurate publicity!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok Linda, somebody HAD to do it.  I realize that I am preaching to the<br/>\nchoir here, but I just HAD to say something about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am incensed!  What is actually funny is how really far off Mr. Berry is<br/>\nfrom the truth.  I realize that editorials are opinion papers, and as such<br/>\nhe is entitled to his opinion about homeschooling in general.  But I find<br/>\nit laughable for him to present his opinion in such a manner as to suggest<br/>\nthat this is well educated, and well thought out, fact!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...it has become rather fashionable among the conservative kook set...&quot;<br/>\nHmmm....well I guess I should be thankful for Mr. Berry&#39;s enlightenment.<br/>\nHere I thought I would be having trouble finding supportive friends in this<br/>\ncommunity due to it&#39;s conservative nature, but I guess, according to him I<br/>\nmust fit right in!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...their youngsters, who are insulated in a loving home far away from<br/>\ngangs, violence and people of other races.&quot;<br/>\nAgain, I must say I find this laughable.  Particularly since the little<br/>\ngirl we are adopting is AA.  Growing up in the heart of San Francisco, as I<br/>\ndid, it is almost impossible to not love and partake of a multitude of<br/>\ncultural influences, let alone harbor racial prejudice and hatred.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Mom occasionally refers the kids to some printed material written by a TV<br/>\nevangelist...&quot;<br/>\nWell I guess I better learn who these evangelists are and where to find<br/>\ntheir printed word, as I should be utilizing it in my homeschooling.   <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...far from the corrupting influences of teachers with college &quot;degrees&quot;<br/>\nand people whose religion, race or political ideology may be different from<br/>\ntheir own.&quot;<br/>\nWell, I must say they would have to run away from home to get away from<br/>\npeople with college in their backround.  I am one of the few people in my<br/>\nimmediate family who does NOT hold one or more degrees (including my<br/>\nhusband) and I did attend college for 5 years, with a focus the last two on<br/>\nelementary education.  That is, until I realized that the kids I really<br/>\nwanted to teach were my own future children, and that I was far more<br/>\npassionate about that than about teaching in the ps system.  As for the<br/>\nother reference to people that are different, all I can say is, there were<br/>\nnot ENOUGH of them, nor enough education about other lifestyles and<br/>\ncultures, in ps to suit my taste and that is also a factor in my<br/>\nhomeschooling decesion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Removing a child from school is to reject the very basis of human<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;intelligence in an enlightened society. It prevents children from<br/>\n&gt;acquiring passable social skills, it deprives them of the opportunity to<br/>\n&gt;forge lasting personal relationships, and it causes ignorance and<br/>\n&gt;outright stupidity on a grand scale. Home schooling creates an atmosphere<br/>\n&gt;of insular paranoia that breeds intolerance and suspicion of people who<br/>\n&gt;are different.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That certainly is a violently strong negative opinion he has there.  I<br/>\nwonder what happened to him to make him so hateful, paranoid, intolerant<br/>\nand suspicious of people who choose to be different?  Well perhaps her<br/>\nnever acquired those important social skills in Public School or learned to<br/>\nbe open minded and think for himself.
