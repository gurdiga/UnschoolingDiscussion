I was on this list a while ago, but had to unsub<br/>\n&gt; because of all the email. I couldn&#39;t take it anymore and missed the<br/>\nsupport<br/>\n&gt; and info!  :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son (9yo) and daughter (4 1/2 yo) also have &#39;different&#39; hours  :-) At<br/>\n&gt; about 9:30 or 10:00 a certain energy comes over our house. Nicholas and<br/>\n&gt; Emily sometimes get a project out and start working on it, or maybe a<br/>\ngame,<br/>\n&gt; or sometimes we all read or talk, maybe doing dishes and a late batch of<br/>\n&gt; cookies, who knows! Some of our best discussions happen in the evening.<br/>\n&gt; Saturday nights are usually late ones, last night the kids got to sleep<br/>\n&gt; about 12:30, but Nicholas woke up at about 9:15 and Emily rose at 10:00.<br/>\n&gt; They are well rested and having a blast right now. Nicholas seems to need<br/>\n&gt; less sleep than me at times. There are some nights that they end up in bed<br/>\n&gt; at 9:30 or 10:00. I think it&#39;s all following their natural schedule.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes they know that it&#39;s a get-to-bed early night as they may be a<br/>\n&gt; little more tired than usual.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Emily, probably because of her age, gets to sleep shortly after we&#39;re done<br/>\n&gt; reading to her at night. Nicholas, on the other hand, listens to some of<br/>\n&gt; Emily&#39;s stories ( I think he like the American Girls books just as much as<br/>\n&gt; we do!) then starts reading his book. He&#39;s been hooked on the Redwall<br/>\nbooks<br/>\n&gt; lately, and stays up for an hour or two after Emily, reading. Reading<br/>\n&gt; reading reading. DH and myself comment at times at what the heck would we<br/>\n&gt; have done if we had the opportunity to read like that. How wonderful that<br/>\n&gt; would be. I remember getting so &#39;into&#39; a Stephen King book when I was in<br/>\n&gt; high school that I stayed home from school for three days to finish it.<br/>\nNow<br/>\n&gt; the schools make kids read for homework-a chore???? Nicholas and Emily get<br/>\n&gt; absolutely baffled when they hear a child say they have to read a certain<br/>\n&gt; book for homework. Yesterday Nicholas crawled back into bed after<br/>\nbreakfast<br/>\n&gt; ( this was at about 11:00) and read until almost 2:00. The weather was too<br/>\n&gt; nice to stay inside any longer....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree that when there is something that someone needs to get up early<br/>\nfor,<br/>\n&gt; the will do it. We are ever changing and evolving. Schedules, plans,<br/>\n&gt; interests.......I say relax and enjoy it. A lot of people don&#39;t understand<br/>\n&gt; it. I know that I couldn&#39;t possibly make my kids go to bed at 9:00, it<br/>\nwould<br/>\n&gt; be torture. ESPECIALLY with the days getting longer, we are out in the<br/>\n&gt; garden usually until 9:30 or later! The kids are happy, and I figure that<br/>\n&gt; something must be going right  :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Take care,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Brynn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
