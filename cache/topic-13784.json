I am a hands on learner so <br/>\nI want to teach that way.  At least until I see my chilren wanting to learn <br/>\nin another way.  He just doesnt see why try something that has &quot;failed.&quot;  I <br/>\ncan see how to make it succeed because it is basicly the way I learn. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I agree with the people who suggest that you sit down with your <br/>\nhusband, and eventually your child to determine your goals and decide what <br/>\nyou consider success.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my 10yo daughter is a success story as are the children of many <br/>\nothers on this list. Try David&#39;s book And the Skylark Sings with Me. In it he <br/>\ntells the story of homeschooling his daughters using the community as their <br/>\ngreatest resource. It&#39;s a very interesting story with lots of good <br/>\nsuggestions for resources in many different areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s our story. When my daughter was starting 2nd grade, we carefully <br/>\nresearched all the schools in the area to which we were moving and purchased <br/>\na house based on the school we thought would be best for her. There were lots <br/>\nof positive aspects to the school and she enjoyed herself and was a <br/>\n&quot;successful&quot; student.<br/>\n<br/>\nI began to have doubts about the school as I volunteered in her classroom of <br/>\nsecond and third graders each week. It seemed that the teachers spent a lot <br/>\nof time on regaining order and trying to convince some of the children to <br/>\nlearn. I could also see clear favoritism and an inability on the teachers&#39; <br/>\nparts to get to everyone&#39;s questions. Often Melina would come home with <br/>\nquestions which she said the teacher wouldn&#39;t answer because she would learn <br/>\nit next year as a third grader.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe final straw came for me when her teacher corrected her homework stating <br/>\nthat her classification of peppers and cucumbers as fruits may have been <br/>\ntechnically true, but was not the way they were learning it in class. The <br/>\nmessage I got from that was &quot;The teacher is the final authority in all <br/>\nthings.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that point I started researching private schools, but was unimpressed with <br/>\nwhat I saw. We had friends in a far away state who homeschooled their <br/>\ndaughters, so I decided to consider the option. I set about doing lots of <br/>\nresearch on the Internet, and at libraries and bookstores. After discussing <br/>\nit with my husband, who had reservations but trusted my judgment I decided to <br/>\ndo it. Melina was thrilled with the idea of being home with her baby sister <br/>\nand me each day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started out with a couple of hours of school at home every day and she did <br/>\nvery well. She was perfectly happy with this method and my husband and I both <br/>\nliked the results we saw. Then the holidays came and we took a Christmas <br/>\nbreak. We were amazed at what we saw. She spent the whole time reading, <br/>\nwriting, making and creating things, and just laying around coming up with <br/>\ngreat ideas. She was learning without any incentive from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that point I did more research about unschooling and decided to give it a <br/>\nshot. Melina has gone from reading on a 4th or 5th grade level to reading <br/>\nadult books, including many classics. She has dabbled in geometry and <br/>\ninformal studies of physics. She has taught me things that I should have <br/>\nknown about U.S. history. She is fast becoming an expert on African-American <br/>\nhistory. She has learned to read Spanish, which she already knew how to <br/>\nspeak. She is looking for an opportunity to volunteer with Spanish-speaking <br/>\nchildren when she returns from her visit back East. She is learning to read <br/>\nmusic and play the recorder. She knows much more than I about local plant and <br/>\nanimal life. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on and on about the things she has learned but that&#39;s not the <br/>\npoint. the point is that she has learned them because she wanted to and has <br/>\nenjoyed most of the journey. She is absolutely passionate about learning and <br/>\nknows how to go about finding answers to questions. Sounds like a success to <br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\ncandice</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13783,"nextTopicId":13786}}
