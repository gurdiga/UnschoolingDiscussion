While I haven&#39;t driven that far, we recently drove from western PA to New England (2 days of driving each way) with kids DD(5) and DS (11 mos) and it was fine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlay in the cold or snow! Just keep the cold weather clothes handy in the car, not packed away in teh bottom of the suitcase.  Or  stop at places (like McDonalds) with indoor playspaces.  But any rest area usually has enough space for the kids to do some inside running around.  But even in the cold, kids can run around outside for a <br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some car activities that we do on long trips. My advice is mostly pitched at the 5yo, I don&#39;t remember tips for a 2 yo.   We try to stop about every 3 hours (that is the &quot;itchy&quot; point for our kids, YMMV).   For our 2 day drive I planned 2-3 &quot;things&quot; to have for each 1/2 day of driving and kept them in a separate bag until their time arrived, so to speak, so that I could introduce new things as we went and not have everything be played with for 2 seconds in the first hour of the trip.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also took a lot of snacks and juice boxes and pop-top small bottles of water.  If I lost one bottle in the care somewhere, I just got another one, rather than having to search. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome things we do:  <br/>\n<br/>\nA laptop computer (if you have one/can borrow one) My 5  year old and I watch DVDs and play computer games in the car.  Or I guess a car version of a VCR. <br/>\n<br/>\nBooks on tape.<br/>\n<br/>\nBooks to look at if you kids aren&#39;t prone to car sickness. <br/>\n<br/>\nGeoboards and rubber bands (we keep one of these in the car, actually, it is good for short trips, also!). <br/>\n<br/>\nMagnets sets (you can make them out of any characters you wish by using self-stick magnetic sheets from Micheal&#39;s to back cut-outs from whatever source). Play them on a baking sheet. <br/>\n<br/>\nFelt sets -- you can also make these out of any characters that you like.  Trace the character onto freezer paper, iron the freezer paper onto the felt, and you have an easy way to cut out the characters.  Or just use shapes, but my 5 yo lkes charecters from books she is currently enjoying.  If you take a piece of felt the size of the baking sheet and put magnets in the corners, you can play it on the same baking sheet as used for the magnet board.  If you just want to use paper-cut outs on a feltboard, glue small squares of sandpaper to the back of the paper-cut out. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlaydough -- use the same baking sheet for a playing space.  Assume that you will throw the playdough away at the end of the trip and vacuum out the car.  Add-ins for the playdough - feathers, googly-eyes, popsicle sticks, large sequins, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nSticker sets (you can also make these yourself of whatever characters you can print on the computer by buying sticker paper from the office supply store).  Or you can buy sticker books pretty cheaply.  DD loves the dress-up dolls ones and the ones for Strawberry Shortcake. <br/>\n<br/>\nPipecleaners and/or twist ties for making sculptures, flowers, people, houses, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nAluminum foil for making scuptures. <br/>\n<br/>\nMake scotch tape designs on the bake side windows.  My 5yo invented this and it is currently her favorite.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBuy a bag of odd cheap toys from a local thrift and pull them out from time to time during the trip. Novelty helps. <br/>\n<br/>\nColorform sets.  I think you can play these on the back side window as well as the board, but I haven&#39;t tried it yet. <br/>\n<br/>\nTravel versions of games (we love the Travel Version of &quot;Guess Who?&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nArt supplies in general (we always have colored pencils, markers, scissors, glue stick, paper, etc. in one of those back-of-the-seat organizers in our car).  When DD was younger, we also kept a magnadoodle in the car.  No worry about loosing the pen, running out of paper, etc.  A write-on/wipe-off board with a low-fume pen attached by a string is another similar option.  I sometimes tell stories and draw them as I go along (a la Harold and the Purple Crayon). <br/>\n<br/>\nOne I just read about, but haven&#39;t done yet.  Make pictures with different lengths of colored yarn on a square of sandpaper.  I&#39;ll cut the sandpaper square to fit our ever-present baking sheet.  You can also put felt on sandpaper and it sticks better than to a felt-board.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I was hoping that someone might have some ideas on how to entertain a 2 year old and a 5 year old on a trip across country.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Rebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100027905,"authorName":"TreeGoddess","from":"TreeGoddess &lt;treegoddess@...&gt;","profile":"odrade7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] long car trips with kids","postDate":"1065100002","msgId":81898,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNGN0MyMkUyLjgwOTA3MDRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMjgwMWMzODg5ZSQ3OTNjMjE2MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGMzLjM4NmY3ZGRkLjJjYWNjYzU0QGFvbC5jb20+IDwwMDI4MDFjMzg4OWUkNzkzYzIxNjAkNjQwMWE4YzBAb2VtY29tcHV0ZXI+"},"prevInTopic":81897,"nextInTopic":81900,"prevInTime":81897,"nextInTime":81899,"topicId":81835,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We take many long car trips with our <br/>\nchildren.  Our first really long one was five weeks of travel from our home in <br/>\nKY out to SF CA and back going the northerly route.  At that time my kids were <br/>\n15mos. 4,5,6, 8, and 10 years old and we took the 14yo daughter of a friend <br/>\nwith us.  We travel in a large 15 passenger van and pull a converted W.W.II army <br/>\nJeep trailer behind us with all of our camping gear in it.  We tent camp as <br/>\nwe go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese trips took a lot of research on my part, I found the AAA to be a great <br/>\nresource for starting the process with their tour books and campbooks and <br/>\nmaps.  I then explored further afield from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe would drive pretty intensely for a day, as in get in 12-18 hours of <br/>\ndriving and then set up camp and stay for anywhere from 2-5 days depending on our <br/>\ninterest in the area.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids did just fine, even the ones who get car sick and the ones who are <br/>\nmore energetic than not.  We had lots of car games, lots of tapes from songs to <br/>\nsoothing to story, and lots of snacks.  We stopped every couple of hours and <br/>\nspent at least 20 mins running around, sometimes we spent longer at the rest <br/>\nstops depending on how interesting they were.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur last big road trip was over 9,000 miles and took 7 weeks.  My kids at <br/>\nthat time were 7, 10,11,12,14 and 16 respectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of my kids like to travel, others tolerate the time in the car in order <br/>\nto enjoy where we are going, but all of them have learned over the years how <br/>\nto cope with long stretches of sitting in one place.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I love these trips as it is a chance to truly just be family <br/>\nwithout any of the distractions of jobs, activities, etc.  It was through these <br/>\ntrips that I actually got the courage to see homeschooling as a viable <br/>\nalternative.  How we lived on the road felt so right and it was obvious the kids <br/>\nwere involved in exploring what they were interested in.  Sometimes it was very <br/>\nhumbling to me to realize that noone else had any interest in a stop that I had <br/>\nflagged as fascinating.<br/>\n  Some of the things we did for in car entertainment were hand held games, <br/>\npaper and all sorts of marking instruments, individual CD players so each person <br/>\ncan listen to their own music when they needed to.  We had group games, the <br/>\nstandard, licensee plate games, counting cows, etc.  Each child got to purchase <br/>\nsomething new to play with for the car before the trip.  Each child had their <br/>\nown bag of stuff and was expected to keep track of their own stuff.  We had <br/>\nlots of snacks available although we limited the drinks a little after stopping <br/>\nfive times in one hour for various people&#39;s bladders &lt;VBG&gt;.  Audio books on <br/>\ntape are great for all ages, we used the Harry Potter books on tape as the main <br/>\nway to use up time on a long two day push from the Badlands of South Dakota <br/>\nback to Kentucky and everyone was absorbed in the stories for hours.  As a <br/>\nmatter of fact we got flack about stopping for rest areas because they didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto interrupt their listening!<br/>\n   We gave out maps and compasses, binoculars, guide books, etc.  Everyone <br/>\nhad a say in where to stop or whether to stop for an attraction.  It can be lots <br/>\nof fun.  My kids are starting to agitate for when are we going to travel <br/>\nagain.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would encourage you to give it a shot.  We have always had fun on the road.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160511152,"authorName":"storyteller","from":"storyteller &lt;seanachai048@...&gt;","profile":"celticrose56","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] long car trips with kids","postDate":"1065096459","msgId":81896,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA0RDlDNEIyLUY0RDEtMTFENy1BNzkxLTAwMzA2NUZCODJCOEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDMxMDAxMjA1NTU2Ljg4MTU1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjgwNDA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":81894,"nextInTopic":81897,"prevInTime":81895,"nextInTime":81897,"topicId":81835,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, Last summer we drove to Texas and back from Maryland - kids age 12, 8, 3.

I make up little goodie bags - <br/>\ntoys, treats, etc. with stuff they each like - matchbox cars, polly <br/>\npockets, little wild animals, card games - whatever little stuff they <br/>\nlike. And I pack up all this goodie bags, and give them a few each day. <br/>\nWe use the map --- ex. when they see the &quot;welcome to tennessee&quot; or <br/>\nsomething like that, and they get a goodie bag. I figure it out so that <br/>\nthey get one every few hours. It really helped a lot, and I had some for <br/>\nthe way back also. I use the kind of little bags that kids get at <br/>\nbirthday parties. I use three different themes, so I don&#39;t get the bags <br/>\nmixed up. (the kind of stuff a 12 yo girl likes is not the same as a 3 <br/>\nyo boy. :-)<br/>\n* we keep coolers w/ drinks and snacks in the car, accessible to the kids<br/>\n* we have a small tv in the car - one of those little ones that&#39;s a <br/>\ntv/vcr and plugs into the cig. lighter (designed for camping) and it <br/>\nwill take two headphone sets. This was great too.<br/>\n* we plan places to stop on the way there, and we took one route down <br/>\nand another back. We also get going early, so the kids sleep the first <br/>\ncouple of hours, and then when they wake up, they have breakfast in the <br/>\ncar -- that alone takes up three hours or so.<br/>\n* portable cd players and books on tape are good too. lots of kids like <br/>\nvideo games.<br/>\n<br/>\nhth,<br/>\nsusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wednesday, October 1, 2003, at 04:55  PM, Rebecca DeLong wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was hoping that someone could help with this.

We improved on that idea and <br/>\nuse two backpacks. Inside there is a bottle of water or juice, zip lock <br/>\nbaggies of cookies/graham crackers, grapes, apples, trail mix (you get the picture). <br/>\nBooks, travel games, etch-a-sketch, personal tape or CD players with tapes <br/>\nand CD&#39;s. Paper and crayons, and erasable markers, and a wash cloth. We put <br/>\nerasable markers in so the kids can draw on the windows. My kids use the markers <br/>\nto play hangman, keep score on the alphabet game, license tag game, and other <br/>\ncar games. They draw pictures and write messages for other drivers too! ;o) <br/>\nEach kid gets a window and the markers can be erased. Both kids have a pillow, we <br/>\nstop every two to three hours. We also, for long trips, put a small cooler in <br/>\nthe back, and fill it with whatever the kids choose, usually sandwiches, <br/>\ncheese and such that they can eat whenever. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past year or so I have included a map of where ever we are going, and <br/>\na list of any things that might interest the kids along the way so they can <br/>\nkeep their eyes out for it. I map our trips out carefully and use Google to look <br/>\nfor things to see and do along the way. We also keep our eyes out for <br/>\ninteresting signs along the highway. We stop for things like, worlds largest ball of <br/>\nstring, drive through zoos, the garden of eden (some guy had himself buried in <br/>\na see through coffin in the middle of his garden), craft shows, town days (we <br/>\nhave gone to parades in towns we have never been to, we see signs that say <br/>\n*Smithville Harvest Festival Weekend* and turn off and go!) only once was it a <br/>\nwaste of time to stop. Some towns have a unique heritage and when they are <br/>\nhaving an all town festival there is usually ethnic costumes, music, food, and <br/>\ncrafts. So if you have the time and see a sign advertising a towns Polish, <br/>\nSwedish, German/days, and it is going on right then, then stop and go!

We are planning to spend x-mas with them this year. I talked to my dad a few days ago and he asked if we&#39;d be interested in driving out. We live in San Diego and they are outside of Detroit. They would pay for the whole trip. We are totally excited. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom however, keeps bring up all the bad points to the road trip idea.
