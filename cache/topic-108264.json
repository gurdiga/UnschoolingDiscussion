I had the hardest time realizing that the rest of the world is in a huge rush to out do each other that they push their kids into anything and everything just so they can say &quot;My ____ learned his ABC&#39;s by age ___&quot; and the poor kids don&#39;t have time to PLAY and be a child. I just read recently that if kids are not allowed to be kids now they will do it later. It is so hard not to get pulled into the world and jump on the band wagon. I decided that I want my child to have his childhood now and so I am letting him be a child before anything else so he can be an adult when he is suppose to be an adult. I remember my MIL telling me of a friend of hers grandkids that knew their ABC&#39;s by age two and I worried about this. I would stress and even take it out on my poor two- year-old at the time. Then I look at the big picture and realize that it will not say on his resume: &quot;Potty trained by age 6 months and learned the ABC&#39;s by age 2&quot;. You will not hear the<br/>\n person interviewing saying:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I see it says here in your resume that you went to _______ daycare as a two -year-old  and we&#39;re named &#39;first to potty train&#39; could you tell me something about that?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n I believe all the pressure does is for the parents and grandparents to brag about the kid and nothing more. It is so hard to not fall into this though.<br/>\n<br/>\n No, my son did not know all his ABC&#39;s by age two but last winter he made a volcano in the snow at age 4!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 5 YO son Jonah is FINALLY getting somewhere. I just spent weeks doing the &quot;letter of the week&quot; thing and last week found out he did not &quot;get&quot; any of them I did! Yes he understood while we did it and so I thought he was learning but after a letter review I was surprised to find he did not pick up the ones I did it on. Yet suddenly he knew letters I have never told him anything about. So I know he is learning more without the hallabaloo. So I just read now. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, months ago I got these little stickers A-Z and put them on his toy cars and trucks. I intended on making games of playing with his toys. Then we moved to Texas and I had forgot about it. Then yesterday he found some of them and I brought them to me demanding I remove the stickers from his trucks as he does not like them.

She rejected it whole.   <br/>\n<br/>\nA week and a half ago Holly (who&#39;ll be 14 in a couple of months) asked me to <br/>\ndownload a song for her, she thought it might be Raffi, Bananaphone.    I told <br/>\nher I thought there was a cassette tape upstairs, told her where, I was <br/>\nright, she found it.   We were going out anyway so she took it in the car.   I had <br/>\nbought that used but about the time Holly said &quot;no Raffi,&quot; so it had just been <br/>\nset on that shelf not knowing it was waiting for Holly to request it <br/>\nspecially.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer interest in this song came from a flash cartoon in which a character <br/>\nhears it but his roommate doesn&#39;t and it drives him crazy.   There&#39;s insanity and <br/>\ndeath in the cartoon (cartoon death).   But Holly just liked the song, and we <br/>\ndiscussed the puns, the humor of &quot;gramma-phone&quot;/Gramophone&quot; and whether that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat caused him to write the song in the first place, about Raffi himself, <br/>\nabout Canadian songwriting, Francophones, American references in songs by a <br/>\nCanadian songwriter, about the children&#39;s music market, long distance telephone <br/>\nhistory and realities...    <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t plan it.

Just living and being and breathing and <br/>\nloving your young children will be getting it right. Pat Farenga (I&#39;m <br/>\nassuming that&#39;s the newer guy you referred to) isn&#39;t, as I understand <br/>\nit, unschooling as many on this list would define it, and the first <br/>\nthing that will be helpful is learning how to breathe through the desire <br/>\nto compare your children with anyone. It&#39;s no more helpful or meaningful <br/>\nnow than it was when they were learning to roll over for the first time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpending a lot of time just reading here at this list, at Sandra&#39;s site, <br/>\nat Joyce&#39;s new website will help you think through and sort out all the <br/>\nnuances between teaching and facilitating. There&#39;s also the <br/>\nAlwaysUnschooled list where there are many parents discussing how to <br/>\nunschool little ones--under age 8 or so--which you might find really <br/>\nhelpful, and you can check out my website linked below and my blog <br/>\nlinked off there to see what unschooling looks like in our home (mine <br/>\nare 8, 6 and 5).<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember about 4.5 years ago I thought it was so great that my <br/>\nyoungest daughter, then about 2.5, could sing the abc song. We were just <br/>\nmoving back East from Albuquerque, NM and hadn&#39;t seen family for a <br/>\nwhile, and they made such a big deal when they came to visit that she <br/>\ncould sing the abc song. That was back when I was really beginning to <br/>\nseriously read and *talk* about homeschooling, so it was like a huge <br/>\njustification as I saw it. Well, as my older child got less interested <br/>\nin singing the song, Julia gradually forgot it. She&#39;s been slower, too, <br/>\nto learn the letters and their sounds than my oldest, who&#39;s just <br/>\ndeciphering how to read now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Julia learned the song, it had little to nothing to do with the <br/>\nactual alphabet and certainly nothing to do with reading, pre-reading or <br/>\nreading readiness--whatever schools want to call it. She will make the <br/>\nconnections between the word &quot;Aaa&quot; and the letter &quot;A&quot; or &quot;a&quot; and the <br/>\nsounds &quot;ah,&quot; &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;aa&quot; and the word apple or all or place when her <br/>\nbrain is ready to make those connections and not before, and when she <br/>\ndoes, she will own it. She comes a little bit closer to this week by <br/>\nweek, month by month and year by year. She asks for help when she needs <br/>\nit, enjoys being read to, likes practicing every once in a while.  Each <br/>\nlittle bit, if my oldest daughter is any indication, creates connections <br/>\nthat will finally make reading itself relatively easy once it all <br/>\nclicks. The process itself can be long but it doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>\ndifficult if outside sources don&#39;t make it so.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren naturally encounter the alphabet, language and the written <br/>\nword. They will naturally begin to make those connections and ask <br/>\nquestions when they&#39;re curious. Numbers are no different. Facilitating <br/>\nmeans getting them out in the world, bringing the world to them, <br/>\nanswering their questions and following their lead. We have alphabet <br/>\nchildren&#39;s books around the house that we&#39;ve picked up over the years, <br/>\none of which is one of Julia&#39;s favorite books. She loves to hear it, has <br/>\nit mostly memorized--all of this is part of the process. We periodically <br/>\npick up alphabet books from the library and read them--part of the <br/>\nprocess. What we don&#39;t do is sit down daily, weekly or monthly to do <br/>\nsome &quot;letter work&quot; because Jules is six and needs to learn to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust last night, Emily wanted to direct a short film, and she enlisted <br/>\nall of us for particular parts. She wanted Jules to play the monster&#39;s <br/>\nvictim, but Jules didn&#39;t want to be a victim. Em said she&#39;d be right <br/>\nback with Julia&#39;s lines for her &quot;scream time&quot;--a really great double <br/>\nentendre though she was really meaning &quot;screen time.&quot; Jules called after <br/>\nher, &quot;But I can&#39;t read!&quot; Em came back in with Julia&#39;s <br/>\nline--&quot;Aaaaa!&quot;--and showed her how to &quot;read&quot; it. Another connecting moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just sharing over at AlwaysUnschooled that I have a saying for dh <br/>\nor other doubters--&quot;Curriculum happens.&quot; I just shrug off comments about <br/>\nhow my kids will learn with &quot;Curriculum happens,&quot; and I share about all <br/>\nthe learning connections kids make over time. It doesn&#39;t happen in a <br/>\nsingle week or a single month, but over time curriculum does happen, <br/>\nwhich is why boxed curriculum and schools are so unnecessary and <br/>\nartificial. Kids, over time, will likely encounter all those ridiculous <br/>\nthings that E.D. Hirsch outlines in his _What Your x Grader Needs to <br/>\nKnow_ books, minus a few poems or songs or stories here and there. When <br/>\nEm was describing her movie to me last night she said it was going to be <br/>\n&quot;like that story about the boy and the girl who loved each other but <br/>\ntheir families fought all the time--you know...&quot; Romeo and Juliet was <br/>\nwhat she meant. Shakespeare. Life creates learning moments and <br/>\nconnections and cultural literacy--we don&#39;t need the Hirsch&#39;s or Bennets <br/>\nto do it for us.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (8), Julia (6), Sam (5)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;With our thoughts, we make the world.&quot; ~~Buddha</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"soggyboysmom","from":"&quot;soggyboysmom&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Preschool ages...what should I provide them with?","postDate":"1126789693","msgId":108273,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRnYnJudCtwZzRwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNlLjcwNGFkZTJiLjMwNWFjMzllQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":108272,"nextInTopic":108274,"prevInTime":108272,"nextInTime":108274,"topicId":108264,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Here are some snippets of how things","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1407860421\">Joyce pretty much summed it all up but I&#39;m going to chime in <br/>\nanyhow ;-) My DS has never been schooled at all (he&#39;s 7 now). Here <br/>\nare some snippets of how things happened at our house:<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;skip&#39; counting AND alphabet both happened as games we&#39;d play in the <br/>\ncar or while he was sitting on the toilet (pretty boring place to be <br/>\nwhen you can&#39;t read) - we&#39;d say the letters or numbers back and <br/>\nforth so he&#39;d say 1 then I&#39;d do 2 he&#39;d do 3...or he&#39;d do a, I&#39;d have <br/>\nb, he&#39;d do c and so on. As he got older, he might decide we&#39;d do the <br/>\nalphabet -backwards- (which is a challenge even for us grown ups <br/>\nsometimes) or we&#39;d do random things like he&#39;d say a,b,c then I&#39;d say <br/>\nd,e, and he&#39;d say f and I&#39;d say g,h, and so on - both of us had to <br/>\nkeep track of where we were because it wasn&#39;t necessarily going to <br/>\nbe just the next letter. We&#39;d play games and (us adults would) total <br/>\nscores by counting in 2s, or 3s, or 5s, or 10s - we&#39;d verbalize it <br/>\ninstead of counting silently. He&#39;d amuse himself in the car by just <br/>\nsitting there counting (lately it&#39;s been hundreds and thousands). <br/>\nOne day (within the last year or so) I realized he was counting the <br/>\nmoney he had in Shrek Monopoly Jr by 2s and then when he got to the <br/>\n$3 bills he paused added $3 to whatever he was at then went by 3s <br/>\nfrom there. He loved the alphabet song as a tot - we had a poster <br/>\nwith animals as each letter and we&#39;d sit and look at that and sing <br/>\nthe song, eventually it even &#39;worked&#39; as a lullaby when he was <br/>\nfeeling fussy.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading: as Joyce mentioned, DS knew Stop and McDonald&#39;s and Burger <br/>\nKing and Friendly&#39;s and Sears and Exit, all the common stuff, early <br/>\non (3 or 4 yrs old) by pattern recognition. And, we read a lot <br/>\ntogether. Sometimes we&#39;d buddy read - he&#39;d be responsible for one <br/>\nword (eg. Dog) and I&#39;d read the rest (this was later 3 and into 4 <br/>\nyrs old and only when he wantd to do it). Over time it expanded to a <br/>\ncouple words and sometimes he&#39;d read &#39;his&#39; word and keep going a <br/>\nbit. Just before he was 5 he asked for a popular commercialized <br/>\nproduct so he could learn to read. Instead (he wanted it NOW and the <br/>\nproduct wouldn&#39;t arrive that fast so he said OK to something else), <br/>\nwe used the Bob books for about 3 evenings (before bed story time) - <br/>\nit was just enough for him to realize that what he was doing was, in <br/>\nfact, reading. Oh, a fun game we played about that time: I got <br/>\nrather tired one evening of reading the Berenstain Bears Ride the <br/>\nThunderbolt for the gazillionth time. So, I started at the end and <br/>\nread the whole thing backwards, siht ekil. DS thought it was <br/>\nhysterical! And it made it more interesting for me because I had to <br/>\nthink and pay attention. In &#39;academic terms&#39;, DS could see me <br/>\ntackling &#39;new&#39; words and figuring them out - modeling the process in <br/>\na real way (sounding things out usually sounds fairly fake when <br/>\nadults who already know the words do it). In hindsight what I think <br/>\nwas going on was that DS was seeing familiar words, breaking them <br/>\ndown, then applying what he recognized to new words. No memorizing <br/>\nrules and exceptions. More of an organic blend of phonics and whole <br/>\nlanguage.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t even bother to tell people you&#39;re homeschooling right now - at <br/>\n3, she is not required to be schooled at all. If anyone asks, just a <br/>\nsimple &#39;we chose not to send her to preschool this year&#39; - leaves <br/>\neverything else open ended. If someone really pushes you might <br/>\neven &#39;name drop&#39; something like &quot;We agree with DOCTOR Raymond Moore <br/>\nwhose research indicated that delaying academic instruction is <br/>\nbeneficial&quot; (make it sound really good). <br/>\n<br/>\nLet her make up stories to match the pictures in her books. Odds are <br/>\nat some point she&#39;ll be saying her story but running her fingers <br/>\nacross the page -as if- she was reading them. That&#39;s the beginning <br/>\nof recognizing that the letters on the page tell a story, correspond <br/>\nto words spoken. That&#39;s a great thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nCount lots of stuff - sort socks (there&#39;s counting by twos for you, <br/>\nunless you&#39;ve got someone in the house with more than two feet lol!) <br/>\nShe may not ask how many somethings there are. Here&#39;s a story from <br/>\nwhen DS was about 3 and a bit: we were in the car, travelling a few <br/>\nhours so we had snacks on hand. I handed him 3 cookies. A minute <br/>\nlater he asked for 4 more. I knew he couldn&#39;t have eaten 3 cookies <br/>\nthat fast so I asked why he needed 4 more when he already had 3 <br/>\nsitting there. He said he wanted 7 and he had 3 so he needed 4 more. <br/>\nWhat could I say? I gave him 4 more. Little everyday things &#39;add <br/>\nup&#39; - setting the table for company for instance. A tip would be to <br/>\nverbalize your thought processes - &quot;we usually need 3 forks but <br/>\nGrandma and Grandpa are coming for dinner so we need 2 more. That&#39;s <br/>\n5 forks we need from the drawer.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t/don&#39;t &#39;work&#39; with DS at all - we live with him. We try to <br/>\nfind stuff that is of interest or might be of interest to bring into <br/>\nhis orbit. Yeah, we had counting bears - they most often ended up on <br/>\nthe receiving end of a game of &#39;bowling&#39; or got crashed into by <br/>\nmatchbox cars or got tossed into a pot of pretend soup - counting <br/>\nthem? not so much.

Learning to read is made up of lots of different  <br/>\nparts. Kids will pick up bits and pieces of the parts as they live  <br/>\nlife. They&#39;ll pick up letters and pieces of words and sounds. For  <br/>\ninstance a child may recongize STOP and McDonald&#39;s signs before  <br/>\nrecognizing all the letters. That&#39;s part of learning to read. It&#39;s  <br/>\nnot like one day she&#39;ll be reading. My daughter, for instance, loved  <br/>\nto write but it took her ages to read. Which seems totally backward  <br/>\nand yet there it was :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nRead to her. (*If* she enjoys it!) Listen to stories and books on  <br/>\ntape. Ask if she&#39;d like to add a caption to the bottom of drawings  <br/>\nand write it for her. Label things around the house and after a while  <br/>\nmix up the labels as a fun game.

The ones who can and the ones who feel it&#39;s a  <br/>\ngreat accomplishment won&#39;t hesitate to show you. Those who can&#39;t or  <br/>\nhave no interest just aren&#39;t making it known. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were in a group of 10 women and someone asked if anyone knew  <br/>\nhow to make a pie crust and 3 women spoke up it might seem like  <br/>\neveryone but you (and the original questioner) knew how but it&#39;s more  <br/>\nlikely that the other 7 don&#39;t. (And they, too, are sitting there  <br/>\nthinking everyone else knows how to make pie crust. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll mothers are just as worried as you are. Maybe more because  <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be sending their kids off to school where the parents are  <br/>\nworried they&#39;ll &quot;fall behind&quot;. If they&#39;re showing off what little  <br/>\nSasquatch can do, it&#39;s a way of voicing their relief that it&#39;s one  <br/>\nless thing they have to worry about.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what does a 3 yo need with the alphabet? How does the alphabet  <br/>\nhelp a 3 yo do better 3 yo things.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo often we look at children as imperfect adults. Better to look at  <br/>\nthem as being perfect for whoever they are today.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did you do to help your child at 2 prepare to be 3? It sounds  <br/>\nlike a ridiculous question. They just lived day by day, learning what  <br/>\nthey needed for the moment and, day by day, became more 3 like until  <br/>\none day, tada, they&#39;re 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with kids becoming adults.

Count real things with her --  <br/>\nthings that are hers -- just because it&#39;s cool to know how many.  <br/>\nThink of it perhaps less as memorizing what order the numbers come in  <br/>\nand more as comparison. When you&#39;re folding you can say &quot;Look you  <br/>\nhave 3 red shirts and 2 blue ones.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMost kids love to sort. Sort real things like rocks and leaves and  <br/>\nacorns and toy collections. Anything she&#39;s fascinated with. (And  <br/>\ndon&#39;t worry if she&#39;s not fascinated now. There&#39;s no rush. She *will*  <br/>\ncount before she&#39;s 18!) Talk about her toys. Have conversations as  <br/>\nyou might with a friend. Ask her questions. How many red cars do you  <br/>\nhave? Where did you get this one? Which cars are boys and which are  <br/>\ngirls? ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do I correct her<br/>\n&gt; when she miscounts as toddlers will (by just repeating the order<br/>\n&gt; correctly, not meanly or implying she&#39;s wrong)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depends but generally I&#39;d say no. It will self correct without  <br/>\nintervention because she&#39;s going to naturally hear the right way a  <br/>\nlot more than the wrong way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or do I correct her<br/>\n&gt; when she makes up the words on a page and point to the right word and<br/>\n&gt; tell her what it is?

You  <br/>\ncan put them in stacks of five and then count. Count nickels. There  <br/>\nare naturally occurring in life opportunities to skip count. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So how does one so young learn to want to<br/>\n&gt; learn specific things like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>By encountering it and thinking it&#39;s interesting. Often they&#39;ll run  <br/>\nacross things quite a few times before it registers. But if their  <br/>\nexperiences are always pleasant -- eg, no pressure to learn, no worry  <br/>\nthat they won&#39;t pay attention -- there&#39;s no reason for kids to avoid  <br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The only thing I can think of is the intro to the cartoon,<br/>\n&gt; Franklin...&quot;Franklin could count by 2&#39;s and tie his shoes....&quot; ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some kids will ask &quot;What&#39;s count by 2&#39;s.&quot; Some won&#39;t. (Probably most  <br/>\nwon&#39;t.) You *can* but you don&#39;t need to ask &quot;Have you ever counted by  <br/>\n2&#39;s like Franklin can? 2, 4, 6, 8 ...&quot; If she&#39;s interested you can  <br/>\nsay &quot;People can count by 3&#39;s too: 3, 6, 9, 12 ...&quot; (Though she&#39;s  <br/>\nprobably too young. Skip counting increases the numbers pretty  <br/>\nquickly and if she hasn&#39;t yet had enough experience with larger  <br/>\nnumbers, it&#39;s not going to mean much.

I know she could recognize the letters if I did, but <br/>\nI was waiting to see if, like in Holt&#39;s books, she just goes straight <br/>\nto reading someday. But that might be awhile and I feel like an idiot <br/>\ntelling people I&#39;m homeschooling (they haven&#39;t ever heard the term <br/>\nUNschooling) and then my 3 year old can&#39;t say the alphabet, and <br/>\neveryone else&#39;s can...<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I get certain counting bars so she can play with them, or just <br/>\nwait until she asks how many of something there is? Do I correct her <br/>\nwhen she miscounts as toddlers will (by just repeating the order <br/>\ncorrectly, not meanly or implying she&#39;s wrong) or do I correct her <br/>\nwhen she makes up the words on a page and point to the right word and <br/>\ntell her what it is? Or is this too much teaching?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I probabaly sound over-anxious, I tend to be. But if you can <br/>\ntell me how you all work with you littlest ones...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that really intimidated me was in the book Teach Your Own, <br/>\nthe author (not Holt, the newer guy) mentioned that their youngest <br/>\ncould count by 2&#39;s forever and by 5&#39;s to 100 by the time she went to <br/>\nkindergarten (by her insistence until she got bored.) I <br/>\nthought, &quot;Man, should I be doing something different?&quot; I just don&#39;t <br/>\nsee how my kid will one day ask, &quot;How do you count by 2&#39;s?&quot; when they <br/>\ndon&#39;t even know what it is? So how does one so young learn to want to <br/>\nlearn specific things like that? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I can think of is the intro to the cartoon, <br/>\nFranklin...&quot;Franklin could count by 2&#39;s and tie his shoes....&quot; ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all your help.
