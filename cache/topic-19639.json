For those who don&#39;t know me, my name is Lara Kimber and I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the Founder and Leader of the L.L.G. -Lifetime Learners of Georgia<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Homeschooling Support Group. One thing my group does is put out a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Print Newsletter that is free to members and available to the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>public<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;for subscription. We are a non-profit group so all proceeds from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;subscriptions go back to the group and to help keep the newsletter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;going. All positions are filled on a volunteer basis. We are an<br/>\n&gt; &gt;inclusive group that does not make any religious or political<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Philosophy a part of the group&#39;s identity. Our newsletter reflects<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this foundation. I only mention all of this so you know the way the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;newsletter is handled. :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am writing today to ask if any of you have any articles you would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;like to submit, and if so I would love to review them for possible<br/>\n&gt; &gt;inclusion in our newsletter. You would of course receive full <br/>\n </span></blockquote>credit<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;for the article and if you have a website, business, or <br/>\n </span></blockquote>organization,<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;this can be a great way to help promote it.

It is also a great resource for *any* parent who is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;interested in the education of their children. So many who do not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;know about homeschooling often put it down due to a fear of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;unknown. Our newsletter currently goes out to many businesses that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;are not officially homeschool related (isn&#39;t everything homeschool<br/>\n&gt; &gt;related though?), such as some Chiropractic Clinics, Veterinary<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Clinics, School Supply Stores, etc. Clinics are putting our<br/>\n&gt; &gt;newsletter out for their patients to read while in the waiting <br/>\n </span></blockquote>rooms.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;We feel this is a great way to reach many people who might not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;otherwise know anything about homeschooling.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The types of articles I am looking for do not *have* to be directly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;related to homeschooling.
