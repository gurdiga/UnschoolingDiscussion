This guy isn&#39;t at all aggressive or vicious - that would be<br/>\na different story - he&#39;s just gets triggered and bites out of fear, and a<br/>\nsecond later he remembers where he is and feels quite bad and slinks<br/>\noutside. I used to teach kids with emotional disabilities, and this dog<br/>\nreminds me of a lot of those kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nCacie has always been pretty good at relating to kids like this, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nPutting him in another room when we come over would be kind of hard,<br/>\nsince we&#39;re living in their guest house. He has become a floor dog<br/>\ninstead of a couch dog for now, though. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t know how &quot;evolved&quot; Cacie is, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s what it&#39;s<br/>\nabout. She said she still likes him but not as much as she did before,<br/>\nwhich is understandable.  She is still angry at him for doing this, even<br/>\nthough I think she understands why he did it. It has tied in really well<br/>\nwith our recent discussions on people doing what they think is right and<br/>\ngood, but what is really wrong and bad. She puts both Judas and the WTC<br/>\nterrorists in that same category...<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
