This boy sneered at Shawn and then stuck out his tongue and gave him a rasberry. I told the boy that that wasn&#39;t nice and how would he feel if someone did that to him. Well, this child obviously has not been taught to show respect to adults and looked me straight in the eye and said with a truly superior tone that no one has ever done it to him. I told him he must have some really nice friends. I then asked Shawn to come away and told him that I did not like the behavior that little boy was showing and that if Shawn was uncomfortable to leave him alone. When I was telling my husband about it this evening (the mom is a firm believer of Ferber and thinks that I may be causing developmental problems with Shawn and Shannon since they sleep with their parents (Shawn with dh and Shannon with me) thereby explaining, in my mind, the yucky behavior of the son) Shawn whispered to me that the boy also called him a &quot;loser&quot;. This is probably the first time Shawn had been called a name, so I asked him how that made him feel and he said bad and then when on to say &quot;I don&#39;t like that boy. I don&#39;t like his behavior. He wasn&#39;t nice at all.&quot; I told him he was right and that if he ever heard someone being mean to someone else it was his job to to tell that person not to be mean to others.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sucks that we can&#39;t protect our children from ALL the mean and thoughtless people in the world...but homeschooling and unschooling certainly helps!!<br/>\nBeth Ali--temporarily out of lurk mode<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":36888606,"authorName":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare","from":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare &lt;nedvare@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: 2163, for Leslie","postDate":"1027308113","msgId":39324,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5NjBGMjI2LkZDNiVuZWR2YXJlQG50cGx4Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjcxNDMwMTIuNTk3LjQ0MDg3Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39291,"nextInTopic":39325,"prevInTime":39323,"nextInTime":39325,"topicId":39287,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
