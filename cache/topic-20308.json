My 15 yo DD has tried to go to bed early and get up, but it is just not in her cards to be a morning person!  She is a night owl like me!  My 11 yo DD tries to stay up with her sometimes, but she is definitely a morning person!  So I tried to explain that to her.  The only problem I have is changing that bedtime too often.  If the circadian rhythm gets messed up by changing bed times, you really feel rotten the next day and beyond for about two weeks.  If I explain this to them, it empowers them to make the decision on how they feel by their actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read an interesting study about teens and their sleep patterns.  It stated that because of the constant hormonal changes in teenagers, that their circadian rhythms were constantly in an uproar, so most teenagers could not get up early, or go to bed early.  And they did much better if allowed an extra hour to sleep.  One school district even changed the morning arrival time to an hour later based on that study!<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Sent: Thursday, May 03, 2001 2:06 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: This week...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;No bedtime was one of the joys of unschooling.
