Those groups want us all to feel that we need to pay them for the<br/>\n&quot;job.&quot;  We know better.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn response to CA&#39;s recent attempts to eliminate homeschooling, Michelle<br/>\nMalkin, a consistently fine syndicated writer, responds with the following<br/>\nrecent column. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.townhall.com/columnists/michellemalkin/mm20020823.shtml\">http://www.townhall.com/columnists/michellemalkin/mm20020823.shtml</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>Michelle Malkin<br/>\nAugust 23, 2002<br/>\n<br/>\nCrusading to keep kids clueless<br/>\nThe public education monopoly can&#39;t stand the thought of &quot;unqualified&quot;<br/>\nparents teaching their own children. That is why they are cracking down on<br/>\nhome schooling, even as a new study shows that thousands of public school<br/>\nteachers themselves are shamefully unqualified to educate the nation&#39;s<br/>\nstudents.<br/>\n<br/>\n(snip of CA specific reports)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;ve said many times before, there&#39;s nothing like stiff competition to<br/>\nbring out the worst in government.<br/>\n<br/>\nNowhere does this prove more true than in the battle between home-schooling<br/>\nparents and public school bureaucrats. More than 1.2 million children now<br/>\ncall mom and dad their controlling educational authorities.<br/>\n <br/>\nTheir overwhelming success -- in academic competition, on national tests,<br/>\nand in college -- poses a mounting threat to the government-run education<br/>\nmonopoly and to the public school teachers&#39; unions.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite abominably low test scores, enormous waste, unsafe classrooms and<br/>\nadministrative incompetence, the public schools have remained a hallowed and<br/>\nuntouchable fixture.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow dare &quot;uncredentialed&quot; parents rise up in revolt? How dare they demand<br/>\nexcellence, discipline, and a curriculum that reflects their values and love<br/>\nof country? Mocking home schoolers as fringe radicals and religious<br/>\nextremists, meddling with their teaching materials, and forcing them to beg<br/>\npublic school officials for permission to educate their own children wasn&#39;t<br/>\nenough to defeat the growing movement.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now California&#39;s educracy has adopted a new motto: If you can&#39;t beat &#39;em,<br/>\ncriminalize &#39;em. These bully tactics are bound to backfire in California and<br/>\nthe rest of the country as the public school system&#39;s incompetence continues<br/>\nto be laid bare. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs California wages its war on &quot;unqualified&quot; parents, a new report by the<br/>\nWashington, D.C.-based Education Trust reported this week that one-fourth of<br/>\nall secondary school classes are taught by public school teachers untrained<br/>\nin the class subject. It&#39;s a problem that hasn&#39;t improved for nearly a<br/>\ndecade. The researchers examined whether classes in four core subjects --<br/>\nEnglish, math, science and social studies -- were assigned to a teacher who<br/>\nlacked a college major or minor in that field or a related field.<br/>\n<br/>\nNationally, 24.2 percent of classes were taught by such unqualified<br/>\nteachers. <br/>\nIn California, 27 percent of classes were taught by the untrained.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwelve states had more than 30 percent of classes fitting that category.<br/>\nFive states -- Arizona, Delaware, Louisiana, New Mexico and Tennessee --<br/>\naveraged more than one-third. Among those hurt the most by this trend: poor<br/>\nand minority students. In schools that serve mostly poor students, the study<br/>\nfound, nearly twice as many courses are taught by out-of-field teachers as<br/>\nin schools with few poor students. In schools that mostly serve minority<br/>\nstudents, 29 percent of classes were taught by unqualified teachers,<br/>\ncompared with 21 percent for schools that have low minority enrollments.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur public schools are filled with substandard math teachers who never took<br/>\nmath in college, French teachers lecturing about biology, art teachers<br/>\nmasquerading as history teachers, and other instructors who have absolutely<br/>\nno expert knowledge or intellectual curiosity about the subjects they&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen assigned to teach.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a system whose first priority is self-preservation of its<br/>\ntax-subsidized employees, not academic enlightenment of its captive charges.<br/>\nAnd they dare to accuse home-schooling parents of educational malpractice?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;A <br/>\nHREF=&quot;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:malkin@...\">malkin@...</a>%3Fsubject=TownHall.com%20Reader%20Comment&quot;&gt;C<br/>\nontact Michelle Malkin&lt;/A&gt; | &lt;A<br/>\nHREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.townhall.com/columnists/BIOS/cbmalkin.html&quot;\">http://www.townhall.com/columnists/BIOS/cbmalkin.html&quot;</a>&gt;Read her<br/>\nbiography&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n©2002 Creators Syndicate, Inc.&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom NHENSpeakOut digest 1374<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sending this column in order to encourage anyone who ever doubts his/her<br/>\ncompetence to provide (direct) a good and proper education for a child.
