I picked up 7 snack size candy bars at the store ( they are 7 <br/>\nfor $1.00)  I bought 3 kit kats, 3 Reeses and one Almond Joy( for me *g).   <br/>\nJP was handing them out.  Anna said, how many do we get?  I said, well, I <br/>\nbought 7.. JP said.. so, we each get two, and Moma, you just get one ( <br/>\napologetic look from him.. lol)  I said, yeah, thats right, I already ate my <br/>\ncandy bar.  JP said. we can each have one kit kat and one reeses, right?  I <br/>\nsaid, well, thats what I bought, but you guys can trade if you want.  <br/>\nEverybody wanted one of each.. JP handed out the Kit kats. .. but. OH NO.. <br/>\nthere were only 2 reeses left!.. He said. MOMMA, you only bought 6!.. you <br/>\nbought one almond joy, 3 kit kats, and 2 reeses, thats 6, not 7.   I said.. <br/>\nhmm, no, Im sure  I bought 7, they are 7 for $1, and thats why I got 7.  <br/>\nEthan said.. OH. I already ate one Reeses.. ( sheepish grin,lol)  OH, so <br/>\nEthan, you only get 1 more candy bar, the kit kat, JP said, and he gave him <br/>\nhis kit kat.   Then Anna says.. So, 7 for $1..thats more than $.10 each, <br/>\ncause that would be  $ .70.  I said, yeah, thats right.. And then she says, <br/>\nthats $.30 less than $1.00, .. and $.30 divided by 7 is a little bit more <br/>\nthan 4, becasue 7 X 4 is 28.. cause 4 weeks is 28 days ( she knows her sevens <br/>\nbecasue of calculating her period)  Yeah, thats right I said.. So, she says, <br/>\nthey are about $.14 each.. plus $.02.. Yeah, thats right.. about $.14 each.. <br/>\nThen Ethan asks , &quot;how much are the big candy bars&quot;  I say.. uhhmmm, I think  <br/>\n $.55.  OH, he says, so its really cheaper to buy these little ones, because <br/>\nthere are 2 little ones in one big one.. Yeah, thats right.. 2 little ones <br/>\nwould be.. (pause  for a response).. $.28!  Anna say.. JP says.. $.28 is a <br/>\nquarter and 3 pennies ( hes a quarter freak.. loves em. hey, what kid <br/>\ndoesnt?)  Yeah, thats right, Jon.  Its a quarter and a 3 pennies  Ethan <br/>\nsays.. a big one is two quarters and a nickel.  so its cost a quarter more to <br/>\nbuy the big one.than two little ones.   This was all just &quot;natural&quot; <br/>\nconversation because they were caluclating how much the candy costs and how <br/>\nmuch they would need to buy some.  I am sure the next time JP has a quarter <br/>\nand 3 pennies.. he will want to go get two kit kat bars or two reeses or a <br/>\nkit kat and a reeses.. LOL.. Heck, he will probably also figure out that if <br/>\nhe as a dime and a nickel he can go get one little candy bar.  Its funnny how <br/>\neven  $.14 candy bar can teach so much<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54780,"nextTopicId":54788}}
