In his last work of prescience <br/>\n(The Coming Boom, 1982), Kahn foresaw our current predicament. &quot;The question <br/>\nremains,&quot; he wrote then, &quot;whether President Reagan -- and ultimately his successors -- <br/>\ncan maintain and build on the opportunities of the present.&quot; To do so, he predicted, it <br/>\nwould be &quot;important to the coming boom to reestablish an ideology of progress&quot; which <br/>\nwould &quot;do as much to hasten the coming boom and give it staying power as any single <br/>\npolicy maneuver can.&quot; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pff.org/publications/ecommerce/\">http://www.pff.org/publications/ecommerce/</a><br/>\nfi2.3futureofprogress.html)<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of his viewpoint is that many people look at &quot;change&quot; as bad, while &quot;progress&quot; implies <br/>\nchange that is good or productive. Even reframing the discussion to how we can <br/>\n&quot;progress&quot; creates energy and optimism which then fuels the kind of change we need.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also espoused the idea that technology is responsible for solving the problems it <br/>\ncreates and often inspires solutions that contribute to boom. He doesn&#39;t shrink from the <br/>\nproblems technology creates, but he stands in warm relief against the &quot;limits to growth&quot; <br/>\nmodel that is oriented toward predictions of doom and offers conservation as the only <br/>\noption for preservation of our way of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"sky is falling/end of world","postDate":"1092057724","msgId":97523,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI4LjVmMmIzYzMwLjJlNDhkNDdjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":97526,"prevInTime":97522,"nextInTime":97524,"topicId":97523,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1731519641\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think the<br/>\nfactory farming, the pollutants from the food industry<br/>\nand other industries, the destruction of the<br/>\nrainforest for beef production to name a few things<br/>\nare an exaggeration.
