He pointed out to me that most of<br/>\nthe information used to make arguments against tv was based on a completely<br/>\noutdated notion of how the human brain works (with the old reptilian brain,<br/>\nand then newer brains added on over time.)  Anyway, this old notion just<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t stand up to what the current research today shows us about the<br/>\nbrain.  Our brains are completely adaptive, and if we have technology as a<br/>\npart of our lives then our brains adapt to that and use it to gather new<br/>\ninformation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really want details, I can try to drag them out of the cob webs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbara<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"Deb Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] TV & The Brain","postDate":"1108769341","msgId":103653,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMjE4LjE2MjkwMi4yNTM2LjAuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103644,"nextInTopic":103657,"prevInTime":103652,"nextInTime":103654,"topicId":103632,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Whiney rant over.*** I m sorry, what was that?

Parents to say &quot;too much radiation&quot; might not be  all <br/>\nwrong but nobody sits as close to a TV as we&#39;re all sitting to near-same  <br/>\ncathode ray tubes (not counting the all-fancy laptop screens and who knows what  <br/>\nbrain-numbing effect THEY must be having, when the picture disappears if you  <br/>\nlook from the edge).<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd BRAIN SLOWING!?<br/>\n <br/>\nMy brain can whip those brains&#39; butts who believe the first &quot;study&quot; they  <br/>\nthink they kinda read on the INTERNET that will justify their treating their  <br/>\nchildren like brain-fragile little proto-people.<br/>\n <br/>\n[I&#39;m cranky because the theater changed its schedule overnight.   Theaters <br/>\nshould change schedules on Tuesday or Wednesday, not Thursday.  So  Kirby and <br/>\nHolly agreed to go to see Meet the Fokkers with me and I was really  giddy about <br/>\nfinally getting to see it, and when we got there they said it&#39;s not  showing <br/>\nuntil 9:30; they changed the schedule last night.  HOlly has to go  to the <br/>\northodontist later and Kirby works at 4:30 and I have something going  tonight, <br/>\nand Kirby works at noon tomorrow, so the fact that it&#39;s showing all  afternoon <br/>\nhalf an hour away doesn&#39;t save me.  Whiney rant over.  NO,  wait--if I could go<br/>\n to the movies by myself I&#39;d have less to whine about.   I can go shopping <br/>\nalone.  I went to the graveyard alone to collect old wax  out of luminarias in <br/>\nthe DARK, but I cannot go to a movie alone, so I&#39;m mad at  me.]<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":87286598,"authorName":"carelia","from":"carelia &lt;carelia@...&gt;","profile":"nortoncr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] TV & The Brain","postDate":"1108758530","msgId":103644,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyMTY1MDAyLjUwMDAzMDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhiLjIxNjZhMzY4LjJmNDdhOTRkQGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDhiLjIxNjZhMzY4LjJmNDdhOTRkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103639,"nextInTopic":103653,"prevInTime":103643,"nextInTime":103645,"topicId":103632,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
