In the 8 <br/>\nmonths that have passed since I joined here, something very <br/>\ninteresting has happened with him.  Back in September, the only part <br/>\nof his day that was structured, was the part at my mother&#39;s house.  He <br/>\nhad to go there when she was available.  Since then, he has pretty <br/>\nmuch structured the entire rest of his time on his own.  We had <br/>\ndiscussions about  his TV viewing and why he felt the need to watch <br/>\nall day and he has since picked out which shows he really wants to see <br/>\nand which not.  Now he goes back to grandma&#39;s for those shows.  His <br/>\nwhole day is kind of mapped out timewise now.  <br/>\nWe have done away with the Nintendo64 too.  That was not his idea but <br/>\nwas done with his understanding and approval.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd an odd thing has happened, some of his OCD behaviours <br/>\nhave lessened.  His overall health is improving and he is much calmer <br/>\nand less likely to have a tantrum now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure which of the factors above played a part in his <br/>\nimprovement and he still has lots of problems, but I am absolutely <br/>\ncertain he is doing exactly what he wants to be doing right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget <br/>\n<br/>\nps - Oh and by the way, please do not refer to my son as having a <br/>\nsignificant mental disorder.

We HAVE come full circle haven&#39;t we Bridget?  When you<br/>\nare using Wyndham as an example as to why rules and structure and, to use<br/>\nyour term, &quot;school&quot; is important, it would be helpful if you pointed out to<br/>\nnew people on the list that you have described Wyndham as having a quite<br/>\nsignificant mental disorder.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the thing about unschooling and rules gets bogged down in the<br/>\nlanguage.  For many people, the idea of rules means something like &quot;We eat<br/>\ndinner at 6:00.  If you are not in your place at 6:00 sharp you will not<br/>\neat.  It doesn&#39;t matter if the kittens are being born, the scrabble game<br/>\nisn&#39;t finished, etc. 6:00 means 6:00 mister&quot;.  In other words, something<br/>\nrigid and arbitrary.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor others, rules means something like &quot;We normally eat at 6:00 but last<br/>\nnight it was more like 7:00.  The cat was having kittens and it was such an<br/>\namazing experience for the entire family.  The kids had made a warm bed for<br/>\nthe cat and after she gave birth they oohed and aaahed and we talked about<br/>\nwhen they were born.  After awhile, Pete said he was hungry and we all<br/>\nagreed.&quot;  In other words, guidelines that are flexible and pliable.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have things they are responsible for but I rarely REQUIRE anything<br/>\nspecific of them.  We all, as a family, talk about our needs to each other.<br/>\nI need to be able to find all the dirty clothes for laundry.  Zach hates to<br/>\nclean his room and likes to live amid his.......belongings.  It made me<br/>\ncrazy to have to dig through all his stuff to find clothes.  Zach and I<br/>\nTALKED about it.  He suggested doing his own laundry.  It is working out<br/>\ngreat.  If we are going somewhere that he needs something particular to<br/>\nwear, I ask him the day before if it is clean.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll families have rules even if they are unspoken ones.  In our home, it is<br/>\nto treat others like you would like to be treated, to act humanely and<br/>\nrespectfully to each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nTV--<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be a big TV limiter.  It was turned off daily from 9 to 5 no<br/>\nmatter what.  Then at 5 the kids would be glued to the thing and I could get<br/>\ndinner cooked without interruption.  One year ago, we did away with all the<br/>\nlimits.  The kids went nuts, spending literally hours and hours watching<br/>\ntelevision.  They watched somethings that I had cautioned them against and<br/>\ngot scared.  They watched some stuff that I cautioned against and got bored.<br/>\nNow they watch television less, by choice, than they did when I limited it<br/>\n(when I limited it we had 10 channels, we now have over 900).  You can only<br/>\nwatch so many Spongebob Squarepants reruns before going outside seems more<br/>\ninteresting.  They also monitor their own content.  The kids will say they<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to watch something because it seems scary.  They even have<br/>\npotential access to erotica due to pay per view and have never watched it<br/>\n(it would show up on the bill).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is easy to not give kids credit to make their own decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32355,"nextTopicId":32359}}
