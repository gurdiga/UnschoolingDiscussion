I love history and am hoping my <br/>\nchildren will too as they grow older.  There is so much about American <br/>\nHistory that I know nothing about.  Having been raising in England I think we <br/>\nconcentrated on everything but America.  Probably because there is so much <br/>\nhistory in Europe and not as much here in the States.  I&#39;m always fascinated <br/>\nby the things I read about the beginnings of this country with the &quot;white <br/>\npeople&quot; (please no one take that as a slur), because my understanding is that <br/>\nAmerica didn&#39;t need to be &quot;founded&quot;.  It was already here and belonged to the <br/>\nIndians.  The &quot;white people&quot; just came in and decided they would like to have <br/>\nit.  So they took it by force.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;ll go and read some more about the beginnings of this country.  <br/>\nDoes anyone have any suggestions about good books to read on that?<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nDawn Falbe  <br/>\nPersonal Development Coach<br/>\nRelocational Astrologer<br/>\n(520) 579-2646<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nThe Path of Least Resistance is Inside of You<br/>\nwww.astrologerdawn.com<br/>\nEnlightening women on how to live their Soul Purpose<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The people who get on in this world<br/>\n are people who get up and look for the<br/>\n circumstances they want, and, <br/>\nif they can&#39;t find them, make them.&quot; - George Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school.&quot;-George <br/>\nBernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25759,"nextTopicId":25795}}
