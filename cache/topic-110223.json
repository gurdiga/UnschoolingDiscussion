(Meaning might there might not have been so stark a problem?)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, because I did know of everything else first.  I had my children in a magnet school from k-3 that professed the theory of multiple intelligences. So I read, at that time (and prior to that, in college) all I could find on the theory, though none of the teachers apparently did ;)  I felt, from the time my daughter was two, that she processed the world differently than most children(I had been an early childhood teacher for 10 years prior to her birth, and I KNEW all kids were different)-- that she was truly &quot;misunderstanding&quot; the world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe school considered her typical because she stayed on grade level (though I could see her struggling and hating the environment and becoming seriously depressed by the age of 8 due to social and organizational issues, mostly.)  They refused to listen to my concerns.  Her pediatrician never felt there was any real &quot;problem,&quot;either.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe began relaxed homeschooling then, with a continual move toward unschooling.  By age 11, things were getting rough again, emotionally, for my daughter, (I have discovered her difficulties become more intense at each developmental milestone.) As I became more interested in unschooling, I began emailing lists and private persons, asking advise on unschooling and psychological testing, etc. because I just didn&#39;t think labeling was a good thing and I couldn&#39;t come to terms with what to do. I didn&#39;t get much response at the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I decided to just listen to my daughter.  And, at age 12, she definitely articulated her need for an explanation for how she could try SO hard, but just not &quot;get&quot; how to fit in, and why things that came so easily to most other children were so difficult or impossible for her. She also developed some facial ticks, for which we could find no medical explanation. We chose, together, to get her tested, because we were looking for relief from the stress and because she trusted me enough to ask for something as bizarre to our lives as a test.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve me, there is nothing worse than sitting in a doctor&#39;s office, hearing a person who knows nothing of your daughter&#39;s unique specialness, list what is &quot;wrong&quot; with her.  But, my daughter, as I said before seemed relieved--like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders--when we reviewed the findings, together.  And, though I hated the doctor&#39;s arrogance at the time, he was very supportive of not attending school, and did give me some decent advise about handling my daughter&#39;s complexities.  He didn&#39;t push medications, as I had feared. But instead, only offered us the option to consider them under certain circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents who really KNOW their children, really KNOW when something is amiss.  That is how I felt--like there was an elephant in the room that no one but my daughter and the 3 other people in her immediate family would acknowledge.  Parents who really KNOW their children also listen and act when their children ask for help.  Since the diagnosis, I feel as if I know my daughter even better than before--like she and I and her sister and her father have more pieces of the puzzle that is her.  Understanding how her mind works has helped us understand our own minds better, too.  It has made us all more empathetic, compassionate, and self-evaluative. And at 14, she knows too, that she has parents who, when she opens herself up to them, will help her through her pain, by taking her out of school, or taking her in for testing, or taking her wherever she needs to be taken.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for unschooling, the diagnosis has helped make that work better,too-- simply because understanding your child to a greater degree can only enrich your relationship with him/her. And I believe that is what unschooling is really about.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: about homeschooling to unschooling","postDate":"1133238606","msgId":110303,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI0OS4yNWYxZGFjLjMwYmQzMzRlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":110301,"nextInTopic":110305,"prevInTime":110302,"nextInTime":110304,"topicId":110223,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I was raised in poverty <br/>\nboth economically and emotionally. I thought I was doing what was best for her by <br/>\nexposing her to the social atmosphere found in public schools. Letting her go were I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t. It was wrong. All she really wanted was to be with me, but please understand, I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t think I could possibly be enough for her. <br/>\n<br/>\nConfronting what I consider now how I&#39;ve ignored her true needs, has been a painful, <br/>\nembarrasing and shameful realization. When she was in my womb, I wanted her so very <br/>\nmuch to love and cherish. And we did, for many years our learning, reading, exploring <br/>\nmusic and cultures different than our own; that was our mainstay. My fears about not <br/>\nbeing able to provide more for her and in truth, my husbands expectations, led me to <br/>\nconclude that I needed to be in the job market. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast year, I finally decided to stop the insanity and do something drastic no matter what <br/>\nthe cost - take both of our children out of public schools. I was terrified, but convinced we <br/>\ndid not and should not have to lose our family to education. Fortunately, my husband was <br/>\nvery supportive and feels healing our family is of far more importance than our financial <br/>\nincome. No small thing for him either since his childhood home was similar to mine. (By <br/>\nthe way, our school district is considered one of the best in our area and the high school <br/>\ntouts its &#39;Blue Ribbon&#39; status far and wide. Needless to say we are surrounding by athletes, <br/>\nand intense parental involvement in all things school related.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing a psychologist who works with families like ours and understands so many of the <br/>\ndynamics that enter into our decisions and not having to ever return to her high school, <br/>\nour daughter&#39;s attitude and spirit seems to have helped her recapture something of her <br/>\nyounger years, a thoughtful, curious, creative and incredible human being. I&#39;m incredibly <br/>\ngrateful that she hasn&#39;t turned away from me, and that our relationship is showing signs <br/>\nof healing, growth and forgiveness. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@e...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; And the Parent-Teen Breakthrough: A Relationship Approach by Myra  <br/>\n&gt; Kirshenbaum<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Nov 26, 2005, at 4:40 PM, averyschmidt wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I believe you said she was 17yo- which means there isn&#39;t a whole lot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of time left to repair your relationship, and if I were you that would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be my top priority...

The parental confusion is a real problem.  Trying to differentiate where the behavior comes from is difficult with some children, and if you guess wrong, you might end up making bad parenting choices in the sense that you are trying to address the behavior without knowing what the need is.  And kids can&#39;t always articulate their need.  Behaviors can look like they are discipline problems, and if you are already unschooling, it can really be deflating.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes a diagnosis is what tells you what the needs are.  And it can really affirm you as a parent so that you know its not necessarily your parenting that is the problem.  Then you can find better information on how to address the needs that are unique to the diagnosis.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":199059050,"authorName":"Linda Knauff","from":"&quot;Linda Knauff&quot; &lt;linda@...&gt;","profile":"lindamknauff","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: about homeschooling to unschooling","postDate":"1133216218","msgId":110294,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGUwMWM1ZjQ2OSQ3MzU5NDFlMCQ2NTAwYThjMEBQQ0hQMT4=","referencesHeader":"PDE1YS41ZDdkMWJlNC4zMGJjYWEwM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":110293,"nextInTopic":110296,"prevInTime":110293,"nextInTime":110295,"topicId":110223,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I am not sure how to answer--as there are many ways I treat her differently than before.  Mostly, it&#39;s more acceptance of how she relates to the world, and a specific understanding of her confusion in the world. It&#39;s also knowing where to step in and assist and where to step back and let her figure things out on her own.  Before, I was in a constant state of parental confusion because I wasn&#39;t sure where the behaviors were coming from and why they were &quot;better&quot; on some days and &quot;worse&quot; on others. It can seem, to others, that people on the spectrum are being inconsiderate on purpose, when it is really just social or communication or sensory or anxiety issues.  I blamed myself for bad parenting when things were bad, and that, in turn, caused bad parenting. Now I can see the patterns to the behaviors much more clearly and react more appropriately. <br/>\n  Because we went through the testing and the results together, we have a common framework to start our discussions when things aren&#39;t going well.  We can be proactive with issues, now that we know them specifically, by, say, talking about characters in books we read or movies we&#39;ve seen that have the same struggles, and how they worked through them or simply adapted and lived with them.  I also understand how difficult certain things really are for her, and I am much more likely to be there cheering her on when she decides to stretch herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess all in all, I am more understanding and more positive, less confrontational and impatient with her than before the diagnosis.  Maybe I could have come to the same place another way, eventually.  But, for us, the testing was a step in the right direction.  My daughter doesn&#39;t see the results as a label, but instead, as an explanation for behaviors that were strange and uncontrollable.  Now that she knows where they stem from, she can choose, throughout her life, whether to address them or not.  The results don&#39;t make us try to &quot;fix&quot; her, just understand and accept and dwell more on her unique abilities.  Because as she well knows, those of us with the greatest struggles also can have the greatest gifts.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Linda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":225870037,"authorName":"six_morebooks","from":"&quot;six_morebooks&quot; &lt;formacies@...&gt;","profile":"six_morebooks","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: about homeschooling to unschooling","postDate":"1133216146","msgId":110293,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRtZnZpaSs0NWkwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIyOS4yOGQzNTFiLjMwYmE3OGYxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":110292,"nextInTopic":110294,"prevInTime":110292,"nextInTime":110294,"topicId":110223,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you for your response. ...

At age 12, she asked if there were any tests out there she could take to find out what was making her feel so different and possibly, depressed.  The dx has helped the whole family understand and support her to an even greater degree than before, but most of all it has helped her understand her own gifts and struggles and to accept herself.
