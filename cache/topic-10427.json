I know this is true in my case, <br/>\nhaving been raised and schooled with the tradititional <br/>\npunishment/reward system.  I am trying to rediscover the single-<br/>\nminded-ness of purpose and inner strength I am told I possessed <br/>\nas a young child, before the interference of school with it&#39;s 10-out-of-<br/>\n10&#39;s and &#39;poor&#39; with it&#39;s peer-pressure and condescendence.  And <br/>\nso I&#39;m unschooling, hopefully to not inflict those things on my own <br/>\nchildren.  I said I&#39;d stay off the &#39;smacking&#39; theme, but there&#39;s one <br/>\nquote I&#39;d like to add, from Adele Faber and Eileen Mazlish and I <br/>\nforget which book of theirs it&#39;s from, or even the exact wording, but <br/>\nit&#39;s something along the lines of how sad it is that even parents <br/>\nwith college-level education, supposedly intelligent people cannot <br/>\nfind a way to deal effectively with their children without using <br/>\nviolence.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t use time-out or any other such form of punishment.  I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t remove &#39;privileges&#39; (what do people regard as privileges, <br/>\nanyhow?  This is a serious question, btw, I&#39;ve never quite <br/>\nunderstood this term) unless they were directly involved in <br/>\nwhatever, so that the &#39;removal&#39; was a direct consecquence of the <br/>\naction, like when the kids wouldn&#39;t tidy up their stuff, so they put it <br/>\nin bin-bags and I said it had gone to the dustbin-dragon.  That&#39;s a <br/>\ndirect consequence. and they chose to put their stuff in the <br/>\nrubbish.  And I don&#39;t use star-charts or anything like that either.  If <br/>\nanyone&#39;s interested in a good book on the subject of training, I <br/>\nparticularly like Don&#39;t Shoot the Dog, by Karen Pryor (I think)  I got <br/>\nit from my local LLL group library.<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10425,"nextTopicId":10441}}
