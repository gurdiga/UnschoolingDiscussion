Rex is working on filling out applications and making a resume. <br/>\nWent down to the state building and got a food handlers card and a form<br/>\nfor employers to send to the state so he is legal to work.  Coloring a<br/>\ncoloring book about the human anatomy-he loves art.  Studying body<br/>\nbuilding and wants to join the local gym when he gets a job.  Studying<br/>\nthe drivers book for his permit next summer.  Wrestling season and club<br/>\nare over for now.  Wants to go to wrestling camp in the summer.  Has a<br/>\nmath book that he is studying.  Still designing how he wants his room and<br/>\nthe dog house he is planning to build.  Sort of took a break for spring<br/>\nbreak since all his friends were out of school.  Every night stays up<br/>\nuntil about one oclock reading books.  Right now reading Sherlock Holmes<br/>\nstories.  Discovered a talent for window painting/art.  Wants to do that<br/>\nwhen he gets a fast-food job for the restaurant he works at.  Wants a job<br/>\nso he can save ahead of time for college.  Wants to be an architectural<br/>\nengineer.  Sometimes does drywall with his dad, but wants a steady wage.<br/>\nWe plan to do a lot of hiking this spring.  Spring is finally here and it<br/>\nis gorgeous.  No more Oregon drizzle.  My kids put together kites from<br/>\nkits.  They&#39;ve been flying them every day.  11y.o. Caleb is very<br/>\ninterested in comedy and is always coming up with new ways to express<br/>\nhimself humorously.  Is an observer of human nature.  Saving up for a<br/>\nvideo camera.  Wants to be a movie producer.  9y.o. Seth is making<br/>\nslushies and selling them to the landscapers who&#39;ve been working in our<br/>\nneighborhood.  Was disappointed that they took his jobs away from<br/>\nhim-they outbid him.  So making a profit off of them.  Follows them<br/>\naround the trailer park asking questions about why they do it this or<br/>\nthat way and how he thinks it might be done.  Still wants to make a lot<br/>\nof money and give to the poor.  His 7y.o. sister, Phoebe, assists him in<br/>\nhis business venture.  She is a little book-writer/illustrator.  I am<br/>\nthinking of scoring more paper at the labs and doctors offices I used to<br/>\nwork at.  Maybe if I make my rounds I will save some money.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\nbabysitting to make money to spend on their interests.  We will divide<br/>\nthat money evenly between the five of us, but I will be the treasurer,<br/>\nfor now.  My daughter sticks like glue when the baby is around.  She<br/>\nloves helping me take care of him.  She wants to be either an animal or a<br/>\npeople doctor some day, so she says.  Lately, I&#39;ve noticed that my<br/>\nyounger kids like to read what I read.  I read a lot of psychology type<br/>\nbooks.  They ask me questions about them all the time.  <br/>\nHusband Kevin is coming around to all the unschooling business.  He<br/>\nacknowledges that the only things he remembers from school were art and<br/>\nsports and shop, because those were what he was interested in.<br/>\nMy best friend&#39;s daughter may unschool with us next summer.  But her dad<br/>\nmay require some sort of written proof of what she is learning.  She<br/>\nwants to be a doctor.  I asked her what school she wanted to study to be<br/>\na doctor in.  She didn&#39;t even know (parents didn&#39;t tell her) there is one<br/>\nonly two hours away.  I told her how she could ask them to send her a<br/>\nlist of entry requirements.

She&#39;s now into The Toothepaste Millionaire.  And we&#39;re reading Nancy<br/>\nDrew,   Mystery at Lilac Inn together.   Last week something (I can&#39;t<br/>\nremember what - I think she found a partially melted crayon) prompted her to<br/>\nask what crayons are made of - I&#39;ve &lt;shamefully&gt; been slow in helping her<br/>\nfind resources for this,  though she&#39;s coming up with some of her own<br/>\n&#39;hypotheses&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll four have been exploring the world of balance as they have been trying<br/>\nout some roller skating - even the 16 month old wanted to do this.  Abby,<br/>\n7yo dd,  wanted to move up to a in-line scooter. She has been saving her<br/>\nspending money from her paper route and I noticed some Schwinn scooters at<br/>\nBig Lots.  (Of course,  they sold out before we got there.....but since<br/>\nshe&#39;d worked so hard for this,  we drove aound to about four or five<br/>\ntoy/department stores and dound one on sale - though not as good as Big<br/>\nLots!  Anyhow,  I chpped in the difference for her.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s amazing to me is that the 16 month old wanted to ride that,  too.  SO<br/>\nI pushed him around while he held one finger of mina anf held the steering<br/>\ncolumn with his other hand.   None of my dd&#39;s have been this interested in<br/>\nthings with wheels at such an early age!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of us have finally switched gears from playing computer games.  Our<br/>\nmajor collaborative effort has been Commander Keen:  Episode four. (If<br/>\nanyone can tell me where to get other episodes,  we&#39;d love to see something<br/>\nelse.)  We think we&#39;ve explored most everything there - except we can&#39;t find<br/>\nthe secret entrance to the Pyramid of the Forbidden.  We know it&#39;s under the<br/>\nPyramid of the Moons.....just can&#39;t seem to get there.)   It&#39;s amazing that<br/>\neven our three yr old has managed to find several secret passages and new<br/>\nmoves to get past some of the creatures!<br/>\nThe 3 yo and 7yo have asked about the proper way to shut down the computer,<br/>\nand I have complete confidence they can do it.   Unfortunately,  Simon,  the<br/>\ntoddler,  has discovered the CD-rom open close button.....he has tried<br/>\nputting in a diskette,  and some kleenex so far,  my to my chagrin :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids are exploring lots of music.  Monster Mash is a favorite these<br/>\ndays.  And Katy likes some of the Moulin Rouge music.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34081,"nextTopicId":34069}}
