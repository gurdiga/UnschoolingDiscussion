They&#39;re cute... not fair, but sometimes they do.  However, if someone really gets a bug they can make an issue of potential food-borne illnesses, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck with your local Health Department for food service rules, codes, and safe food-handling regulations.  Additionally, most in-home bakeries are regulated/licensed by the Department of Agriculture and do require some type of inspecting, etc.  Some things may vary by state.  The only time they are not regulated is if you are offering the items for donation only without any &quot;suggested&quot; price - just strict donation.  I would suggest getting the info on safe food-handling from your local health departmetn though - it can be interesting and helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as buisness licenses go, that also varies by state and locality.  Again, kids usually skate on this issue too, but if you want you can check into it.  You can check with the state on different types of buisness organizations and associated filing fees, check your local city/township/municipalities for additional licensing and zoning regulations.  Usually you need some type of vendor&#39;s license too.  I believe they don&#39;t charge sales tax on prepared foods in Ohio, but that may vary by state - I don&#39;t know.  Your local SBA (Small Business Association) is great for all that info too - and you can find them online.  Many times the SBA even has pre-made packets of all the different forms and information related to the type of business you want to start.

And the kids stuff <br/>\nis in layaway instead of just being bought outright.<br/>\nWe can&#39;t afford to buy a lot of extra stuff for the next few months. <br/>\nWe have some monthly bills that will be payed off in about 3-5 <br/>\nmonths, things will be much easier financially then. But until then, <br/>\nit&#39;s reality. I&#39;m not going to buy stuff we don&#39;t actually need, if <br/>\nwe are having trouble covering actual needs. Wants will have to wait. <br/>\nThat isn&#39;t just the kids, that&#39;s me and my husband too. I don&#39;t like <br/>\nit, but right now, it&#39;s part of our life. I&#39;ve tried to offer the <br/>\nkids real choices. You *CAN* spend X amount of money this month on <br/>\nstuff you want. That&#39;s all that is available for that kind of thing <br/>\nthis month. What would you like to spend your money on? (usually a <br/>\ntoy or a book but not always)and where do you want to spend it? (they <br/>\nreally like thrift stores. The money goes a lot farther. LOL) WE have <br/>\nalso brainstormed together for ways to save money so that we could <br/>\nafford to do something the kids really wanted to do. Some of their <br/>\nsuggestions have been pretty funny. But at least it let them feel a <br/>\npart of things.And a couple of their suggestions have really been <br/>\ngood ones.<br/>\n I remember at one point,when I was about 9 or so, my parents had <br/>\nsome pretty severe money problems that lasted for a few years. I <br/>\nremember that when they finally were honest with me about what the <br/>\nproblems were, I was okay with it. I knew there was something wrong, <br/>\nand what I imagined was much worse than what the reality was. <br/>\nI get really tired of having to say, we don&#39;t have the money right <br/>\nnow, too. But no matter how much I don&#39;t like it, it&#39;s the reality. <br/>\nAnd for right now, I can&#39;t change that a whole lot. All I can do is <br/>\nlet them know that their needs are being taken care of, they are <br/>\nloved, and that isn&#39;t going to change. <br/>\nnisha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Andy Holly Clarke&quot; <br/>\n&lt;ahclarke@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; money has been tighter than usual lately and there have been more <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and more times that i have had to tell my children that we can&#39;t buy <br/>\nsomething that they want that we normally would be able to buy.   i <br/>\nam tired of telling them that we can&#39;t afford it, we don&#39;t have the <br/>\nmoney, we can&#39;t buy it.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162315742,"authorName":"Joni Zander","from":"Joni Zander &lt;fotoceo@...&gt;","profile":"cmjoni","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: money issues","postDate":"1097003482","msgId":100312,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU4NkRCREQ2LTE3MDItMTFEOS1BMzVELTAwMEE5NUYwQjZDMEBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwOTY5ODMwODguMTAxMC45NjY3MC5tMTlAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwOTY5ODMwODguMTAxMC45NjY3MC5tMTlAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":100256,"nextInTopic":100317,"prevInTime":100311,"nextInTime":100313,"topicId":100256,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Holly, I don t know if this book would have the wording you re looking for, but it could be a fun way to get the whole family involved in being frugal.
