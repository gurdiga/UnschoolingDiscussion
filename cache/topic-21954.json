Apparently, Diana Krall has included this song in her repertoire - the only cd I have of hers is not the one where it is included(of course).<br/>\n<br/>\nHow funny that my 5yo loves a &quot;torch song&quot;.  I think it is because when I was pregnant with her, I could only tolerate jazz or classical.  Pop, country or news radio made me quite nervous.  In fact, when she was a baby and would get fussy, all I had to do was put on some jazz and she would calm right down.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite jazz program is &quot;The Ed Love Program&quot; on NPR - maybe it is only a Detroit thing, but he is super, and plays the greatest stuff.  Not the new age, regurgitated for the demographics, but the hard nose, true jazz.  He did a simulcast of Ken Burns PBS Jazz program, and about a week later played Duke Ellington at the Newport Jazz Fest(1954?) that was out of this world.  I have it on my wish list.  Jazz gets in my soul, there is something about it I cannot describe.  Thankfully, my daughter shares my eclectic taste in music - I can&#39;t wait til she can hit some of the blues and jazz clubs here in Detroit - she would love it - but I think 5yo is a bit young&lt;g&gt;.  On Weds nights at the zoo, they have jazz programs, and in our little suburb they have free shows on weeknights in the summer that she and I adore.
