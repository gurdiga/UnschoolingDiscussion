Whereas if they<br/>\n  have complaints, then they have a powerful need to vent to whoever will<br/>\n  listen ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Peter Kowalke is one grown unschooler. He has a webpage at<br/>\n  http://www.peterkowalke.com/<br/>\n<br/>\n  Grace Llewellyn runs the Not Back to School Camp (http://www.nbtsc.org) and<br/>\n  they have a message board. I&#39;d bet many of the kids keep in touch after<br/>\n  they&#39;ve moved on.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; You see I still have this FEAR that my child is missing something from this<br/>\n  &gt; that I will regret years down the road.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It helps if you can try to identify what exactly you&#39;re afraid he&#39;ll miss.<br/>\n  Too often we end up choosing the path laid out by &quot;experts&quot; because we&#39;re<br/>\n  certain there are things we&#39;d never think to ask about but that the experts<br/>\n  have already asked all possible questions and found answers to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  School-type learning (eg, making sure they cover &quot;the essentials&quot;) is *one*<br/>\n  solution. But it&#39;s a solution with it&#39;s own flaws. Learning &quot;because it&#39;s<br/>\n  important to your future&quot; is hard and time consuming and is designed more to<br/>\n  provide feedback that the things were taught not that they were learned.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So what is it you&#39;re afraid he&#39;ll miss? If you can pinpoint your worries,<br/>\n  they can be dealt with.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Unschooling sounds good and seems to<br/>\n  &gt; work as far as keeping my son happy with learning.  But I&#39;m having serious<br/>\n  &gt; doubts that HE is learning all he will need later.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If we assume there&#39;s a body of learning that is unconnected to what it would<br/>\n  be used for, then that&#39;s a legitimate worry.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unfortunately school gives us the impression that there&#39;s a *huge* body of<br/>\n  knowledge that&#39;s unconnected to its use. Mainly because schools teach it<br/>\n  that way: isolated and out of context. The only way to learn math seems to<br/>\n  be to do a gazillion math problems. The only way to learn science seems to<br/>\n  be to memorize all the answers scientists have discovered. The only way to<br/>\n  learn history is to start at the beginning and go through all the<br/>\n  &quot;important&quot; events to present day.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But when we learn by living life, all that stuff becomes tools that we pick<br/>\n  up and use for the purpose intended. There&#39;s no reason not to use (and learn<br/>\n  as a side effect) math when there are games and stuff to spend allowance on<br/>\n  and things to figure out. There&#39;s no reason not to use science when the<br/>\n  world is full of wonderous things and a child is filled with curiosity. (It<br/>\n  won&#39;t look like school science. It will look like -- and *be* -- real<br/>\n  science: observing and asking questions and theorizing what could be the<br/>\n  cause.) There&#39;s no reason to not use history when the past is full of<br/>\n  stories of interesting people and places and events.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I also have to disagree with the TV watching.  NO CHILD, unschooled,<br/>\n  &gt; homeschooled, public schooled, or anything else can benefit from watching ALL<br/>\n  &gt; the TV they want!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  What if you said &quot;NO CHILD can benefit from reading ALL the books they<br/>\n  want!!&quot; or &quot;NO CHILD can benefit from playing ALL the games they want!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s assuming (or extrapolating from some different situation) that when<br/>\n  children are allowed all the TV they want, they&#39;ll do little else, that<br/>\n  they&#39;ll spend years watching indescriminately.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Why would they?<br/>\n<br/>\n  *If* TV is controlled and doled out like a prize, then they&#39;ll watch garbage<br/>\n  just because TV is so precious. *If* they are in school, they&#39;ll often watch<br/>\n  TV as a way of depressurizing after school.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooled kids, given free access to TV have neither of those reasons for<br/>\n  watching TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Sorry folks, but that&#39;s just my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But are you basing what you say on your opinion of what will happen or on<br/>\n  personal knowledge of allowing your kids for many months to watch as much TV<br/>\n  as they want?<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; There&#39;s far too much GARBAGE on TV to have a positive influence.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Why do you think children would choose deliberately to watch garbage? Do our<br/>\n  tastes need to be molded by experts in what is good in order to choose what<br/>\n  is good? Or can our kids develop their own sense of what is good and bad by<br/>\n  experiencing good and bad and deciding from their experience what is useful<br/>\n  to them and what is not?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Or are children such slaves to a need to be entertained that they&#39;d choose<br/>\n  garbge over going somewhere or doing something they enjoy with mom?<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; THere is no requirement of<br/>\n  &gt; thinking for a child when they watch hours of TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe if children feel overloaded and are choosing TV as a way to turn off<br/>\n  the pressures they have no control over. (As schooled kids might.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  But since my daughter absorbes tons of stuff -- things that relate to her<br/>\n  world as well as the adult world -- then I&#39;d say she&#39;s doing a great deal of<br/>\n  thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I don&#39;t care how *Good* the<br/>\n  &gt; programs are.  Children develop mentally by THINKING, using their imagination,<br/>\n  &gt; creativity!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  And many children find TV a great fodder for thinking, imagination and<br/>\n  creativity. Pokemon has branched off into a huge number of things that<br/>\n  relate to adult knowledge and adult skills.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But I think we also need to recognize the value of their needs as the people<br/>\n  they are right now. Memorizing all 251 Pokemon isn&#39;t something she&#39;ll use<br/>\n  much as an adult -- though it exercises skills she&#39;ll use as an adult -- but<br/>\n  it&#39;s something that&#39;s important to the person she is right now. And feeding<br/>\n  what&#39;s important to her right now is what will help her become the person<br/>\n  she will be.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; How can people think  that PS is a bad influence but then can let the child<br/>\n  &gt; sit in front of the TV hours on end???<br/>\n<br/>\n  Because there&#39;s more than passively watching involved in PS. There&#39;s being<br/>\n  there by force, listening to and doing something they don&#39;t care to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A child watching TV is choosing what appeals to him, what *he* finds useful.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; And I don&#39;t believe they are watching<br/>\n  &gt; *EDUCATIONAL* programs all this time.  Children learn from TV good and bad.<br/>\n  &gt; Are these parents who allow unlimited TV being selective about what they<br/>\n  &gt; watch?<br/>\n<br/>\n  There isn&#39;t a need to. Children are self-selective. My daughter may choose<br/>\n  things that I wouldn&#39;t choose for her, but she has needs that are different<br/>\n  than mine. I&#39;m not sure what she&#39;s getting out of Squarebob Spongepants, but<br/>\n  the enthusiasm with which she watches it and then replays verbally for me<br/>\n  all the episodes, means there&#39;s something important to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She won&#39;t watch anything that&#39;s scary or sexual any more than she&#39;d watch a<br/>\n  political talk show. Her world is divided into useful to her and not useful<br/>\n  to her rather than good and forbidden.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am selective about what *I* watch. There are R movies that we choose to<br/>\n  watch when she isn&#39;t there or has other things to occupy her. We don&#39;t force<br/>\n  her to choose between watching an adult movie with us vs being alone. But<br/>\n  given full freedom to choose anything she wants, she doesn&#39;t choose the<br/>\n  things I would protect her from anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

We told you that the first market edition would be released on<br/>\nJanuary 31, 2001.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of you asked what an Authors Special Pre-publication Edition was and<br/>\nhow it would differ from a first market edition. We explained that John<br/>\nhad actually published the book himself in the full format he wanted to see<br/>\nreleased. He was concerned that most publishers would argue against a 3<br/>\npound, 412 page book and would want to edit it down to a smaller size. By<br/>\npublishing it himself (the Authors special edition)and demonstrating that<br/>\nthere was a good market for the book as is, he hoped to be in a stronger<br/>\nnegotiating position when he made a deal with a bigger publishing company.<br/>\nHis original intent was to have a deal with a publisher by the end of the<br/>\nyear and to have them release the first edition for the general market by<br/>\nthe end of January.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been some changes and a special offer for purchasers of the book.<br/>\nA documentary based on Johns book is now in the works. Because of the film,<br/>\nJohn wants to stay flexible and keep all of his options open, so he has<br/>\ndecided not to make a deal with any publishers for the rights to his book<br/>\nthis year. There will be no first market edition in January. John will<br/>\ncontinue to publish the current edition until late next spring. At that<br/>\ntime, he may consider making a deal with a publisher, but he has decided<br/>\nthat he will not allow a reduction in the size of the book. Subsequent<br/>\nprintings will correct a few typos, and the cover art may be changed to<br/>\nsomething that will reproduce better in catalogs, but the book will remain<br/>\nthe same.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow heres another great reason to purchase this book. Everyone who<br/>\npurchases a copy before September, 2001 is eligible for what John is calling<br/>\na Writers Vacation. A drawing will be held during the first week of<br/>\nSeptember, 2001 and the winner will get airfare and up to a month in an<br/>\nocean view apartment with three bedrooms in Alicante, Spain for use between<br/>\nNovember 30 and March 30 when the weather in Alicante is spring-like. If<br/>\nenough books are sold, John might even throw in airfare for an additional<br/>\nperson and a free rental car for two weeks!<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone who has purchased The Underground History of American Education<br/>\nfrom FUN Books is eligible for this drawing and can participate by sending<br/>\nin a post card. With every purchase, we will include directions on what to<br/>\nput on your postcard and where to send it. If you purchased a copy from us<br/>\nbefore this offer was made, you are still eligible to participate.
