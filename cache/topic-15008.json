My husband identifies her as socially gifted. She gets along <br/>\nincredibly well with people of many different backgrounds and ages. We have <br/>\nmoved numerous times and she has always found a best friend within days. The <br/>\ngift I most appreciate in her is her capacity for empathy and compassion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat she&#39;s up to.....She has decided she wants to create an original recipe <br/>\nfor a dessert. Last night she made a list of ingredients and we went to the <br/>\nstore so she could shop for them. Today she&#39;ll start experimenting. She is <br/>\nvery excited about all this, and really enjoys cooking. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s taking swimming lessons, looking to get back into karate and waiting <br/>\nfor the next session of Junior Rangers to start. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39; reviewing fractions, percentages, and decimals, and working on improving <br/>\nher Spanish vocabulary and reading skills. In English, she is reading A <br/>\nWrinkle In Time again, as well as this month&#39;s mother/daughter book club <br/>\nselection. She also likes going to cafes with me to do some fiction writing, <br/>\nbut only in small doses. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe continues to be a great help to me around the house and with the younger <br/>\nkids, and I can see her level of responsibilty growing considerably.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has expressed an interest in sewing, so we&#39;re going to get her some <br/>\nsupplies this weekend. She&#39;s on her own, because I am domestically challenged.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe hasn&#39;t designed any rockets or won any chess tournaments (though she does <br/>\nlike to play with Daddy), but we&#39;re having a great time. <br/>\n<br/>\ncandice<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nHold fast to dreams<br/>\nFor if dreams die<br/>\nLife is a broken-winged bird<br/>\nThat cannot fly.<br/>\n-Langston Hughes</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15001,"nextTopicId":14976}}
