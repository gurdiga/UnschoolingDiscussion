For all we know, it could be the forced system that<br/>\nled to their situation, in fact, I know of several people where this is the<br/>\ncase, my own brother being a prime example. Since he is an adult and is able<br/>\nto pursue what his interests are, he has learned many things beyond my<br/>\ncapabilities (probably because I am not interested in them). But he had a<br/>\nhorrible time with &quot;school&quot; related material, and his self-esteem was<br/>\nterrible. He is one of the happiest people I know now. . . he has really<br/>\nsoared since he got out of any educational system. I know my daughter would<br/>\nhave been labeled dyslexia, and I suspect my son would too, if we ever got<br/>\nthem tested. I know the signs, but I choose to allow them to develop<br/>\nnaturally, without intervention, or any of the ways in which they &quot;teach&quot;<br/>\npeople with dyslexia/ld to read. My daughter reads just fine now. She<br/>\noccasionally still writes things backwards, but since most of her writing is<br/>\ntyped, it doesn&#39;t seem to hamper her at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28801,"nextTopicId":29021}}
