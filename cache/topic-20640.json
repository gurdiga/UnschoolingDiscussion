They are not of<br/>\nher sweet face, but of her bare behind.

They are not of her sweet face, but of<br/>\nher bare behind. There are 12 in all, taken, her mother says, day by day as<br/>\nthe doughnut- shaped bruises on each cheek faded from a mottled purple to a<br/>\ndirty gray.<br/>\n<br/>\nMegan&#39;s father, Robert Cahanin, recalls that when he first saw the bruises,<br/>\nhours after she was paddled by her school principal for elbowing a friend in<br/>\nthe cafeteria, he collapsed on the floor, crying. Then he picked up the<br/>\nphone and called the police, the school board, the governor, his lawyer.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It hurt me more than it hurt Megan,&quot; Mr. Cahanin said in a twist on the old<br/>\nparental prespanking saw. &quot;You don&#39;t hit on my baby.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMegan, a fourth grader whose name appears more often on the honor roll than<br/>\non a referral slip to the principal&#39;s office, is one of millions of public<br/>\nschool students still subject to corporal punishment, and in March her<br/>\nfamily joined a small but apparently growing number who are suing to stop<br/>\nit. Megan&#39;s classmate DeWayne Ebarb, a hyperactive child who has been<br/>\npaddled regularly throughout his time at Zwolle Elementary — on 17 occasions<br/>\nin 8 weeks last fall alone — filed a second suit in late April, leaving this<br/>\nclose- knit logging town of 2,000 pondering a practice as old as time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough it gets little attention, corporal punishment in schools remains<br/>\nlegal in 23 states, and the United States Education Department&#39;s most recent<br/>\ndata show that 365,000 children were paddled in the 1997-98 school year,<br/>\nmost in a swath of Southern states that could be called the Belt Belt.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet recent debate over corporal punishment focuses largely on parents, with<br/>\neven many pro-spanking psychologists and pediatricians loath to support the<br/>\nprincipal&#39;s paddle. At the same time, though, some school districts and<br/>\nstates say they must increasingly rely on physical discipline as the public<br/>\npushes for a crackdown on student misbehavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd legislation pending in Congress as part of President Bush&#39;s education<br/>\npackage could expand the practice by giving teachers and principals broad<br/>\nprotection from liability for disciplinary actions.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Almost every democracy in the world has bans on corporal punishment — we&#39;re<br/>\ngoing in the opposite direction,&quot; said Robert Fathman of Dublin, Ohio,<br/>\npresident of the National Coalition to Abolish Corporal Punishment in<br/>\nSchools. &quot;You can&#39;t whack a prisoner, but you can whack a kindergarten<br/>\nchild.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in many communities like Zwolle (pronounced zeh-WAH-lee), a hamlet about<br/>\n80 miles south of Shreveport best known for its annual tamale festival,<br/>\nparents and educators base their support for corporal punishment on two<br/>\npowerful sources: the Bible, and their own experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;That&#39;s the way that I grew up, that&#39;s the way it&#39;s always been in this<br/>\nsociety here,&quot; said Dan Leslie, superintendent in Sabine Parish, whose 12<br/>\nschools include Zwolle Elementary. &quot;You act ugly, you do something bad, you<br/>\nget a whipping.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the 27 states that have banned corporal punishment in school, the first<br/>\nwas New Jersey, in 1867. Massachusetts came next, a century later, in 1971.<br/>\nWhen Mr. Fathman started his crusade in 1984, after his own daughter landed<br/>\non the painful end of a paddle, five states had adopted bans. The 27th, West<br/>\nVirginia, acted in 1994, following states that also include New York and<br/>\nConnecticut.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe number of paddlings around the country, the Education Department figures<br/>\nshow, dropped from 1.4 million in the 1979-80 school year to 613,000 in<br/>\n1989-90 to 470,000 in 1993-94. In many states that allow corporal<br/>\npunishment, individual districts ban it, and in most schools that allow it<br/>\nparents can sign a form exempting their children. Black students are 2.5<br/>\ntimes as likely to be struck as white students, a reflection of what<br/>\nresearchers have long found to be more frequent and harsher discipline for<br/>\nmembers of minorities.<br/>\n<br/>\nCourt challenges have been largely unsuccessful, given a 1977 decision by<br/>\nthe Supreme Court rejecting the notion that paddling is cruel and unusual<br/>\npunishment. A decade later, a federal appeals court ruled that a New Mexico<br/>\ngirl held upside down and beaten had been denied due process, signaling that<br/>\nschool officials could be held liable for severe beatings. But similar<br/>\nfindings have been rare.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The vast preponderance of the lawsuits challenging the use of corporal<br/>\npunishment in individual instances are unsuccessful,&quot; said Charles Vergon, a<br/>\nprofessor at Youngstown State University in Ohio who has studied the issue<br/>\nfor 15 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nFamilies tend to win such cases, Professor Vergon said, only when educators<br/>\nhave &quot;abused in a fairly significant way the public&#39;s trust.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe federal liability-protection legislation mimicks statutes in nine states<br/>\nwhere paddling is popular, including Louisiana. Scott McLellan, a White<br/>\nHouse spokesman, said the measure would head off frivolous lawsuits against<br/>\neducators and cited a survey showing that 31 percent of high school<br/>\nprincipals were involved in litigation last year, up from 9 percent a decade<br/>\nearlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany education and medical groups oppose corporal punishment, saying it<br/>\naggravates aggression and can cause depression.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Robert Surgenor, a detective in Berea, Ohio, who wrote a recent book on<br/>\ncorporal punishment, said &quot;pain is probably the most effective form of<br/>\ndiscipline.&quot; Over 14 years, Detective Surgenor said, he investigated more<br/>\nthan 150 cases of children who had assaulted their parents and found that<br/>\nfewer than 2 percent had been subjected to corporal punishment, a much<br/>\nsmaller proportion than in the community as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily Williams, a kindergarten teacher in rural Mississippi, said that when<br/>\nshe arrived from Williams College last year, she was horrified to hear<br/>\nteachers striking students in the hallways, the classroom and the cafeteria.<br/>\nBut by March, frustrated by her own inability to control her class, she had<br/>\npicked up the paddle herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s so easy to say that&#39;s crazy or that&#39;s brutal or unnecessary or savage,<br/>\nbut it&#39;s part of the whole system,&quot; Ms. Williams said. &quot;A lot of things are<br/>\ndifferent down here.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert Cahanin and his wife, Chenette, never complained when their older<br/>\nchild, Matthew, got a few swats for leaving his seat or ignoring directions.<br/>\nBut it was different when Mrs. Cahanin picked up Megan, who weighed 68<br/>\npounds, from school that day last December. Megan started to cry. Then she<br/>\nshowed the bruises.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;She had to give me a reason why she hit Megan that hard,&quot; Mrs. Cahanin said<br/>\nof the principal, Judy Rials, who had administered the customary three<br/>\nlicks. &quot;If I had done that to Megan, I would be consulting an attorney to<br/>\nget me out of jail.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she heard of the Cahanins&#39; complaints, Joy Ebarb, DeWayne&#39;s mother,<br/>\nbegan to question the repeated paddling of her son, who takes Ritalin for<br/>\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder. DeWayne says the paddling does not<br/>\nhurt. But his mother says he has started to flinch when she reaches to hug<br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt school, Mrs. Rials keeps the Ten Commandments posted behind her desk,<br/>\nalong with the aphorisms &quot;When we tolerate everything . . . we stand for<br/>\nnothing,&quot; and &quot;That which doesn&#39;t kill you will make you stronger.&quot; The<br/>\nteachers have 3-by-9- inch paddles, most made by students in wood shop; Mrs.<br/>\nRials&#39;s, about six inches longer, was taken by the district attorney&#39;s<br/>\noffice, which cleared her after an investigation into the paddling of Megan.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s not our favorite part of the day,&quot; Mrs. Rials said of paddling, which<br/>\nshe has done hundreds of times in four years as principal. But it is better<br/>\nthan suspension, she said, particularly for fourth graders, who must pass a<br/>\nstate test to be promoted. &quot;You can&#39;t educate a child if they&#39;re not in the<br/>\nclassroom,&quot; she said. &quot;Keeping children from the classroom could be<br/>\ndevastating. It could change their lives.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSince her paddling, Megan Cahanin has started biting her nails and, most<br/>\nmornings, tries to avoid going to school, her parents say.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Cahanin and Ebarb lawsuits, against the school district and Mrs. Rials,<br/>\nargue that corporal punishment violates the guarantee of equal protection,<br/>\nsince it is illegal for those in authority to hit prisoners, nursing home<br/>\nresidents or children in foster care.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question has generated scores of messages on a community forum on the<br/>\nInternet, and gossip around town. Some accuse Megan&#39;s parents of beating her<br/>\nthemselves, or blame them for showing the snapshots around. Others suggest<br/>\nthat the whole school district, the entire town hierarchy, is corrupt.<br/>\nPeople quote religious maxims, and talk about when they were coming up.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Lord said, Spare the rod, spoil the child, and I think he knows a lot<br/>\nmore than those bleeding-heart liberals,&quot; Pat Ebarb (no relation to<br/>\nDeWayne), the police chief in nearby Noble, said over coffee and cigarettes<br/>\nat Bill & Sissy&#39;s Cafe. &quot;A child needs discipline. I don&#39;t believe they<br/>\nought to be abused or mistreated, but if they need their behind dusted, let<br/>\nthem get it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTears come whenever Mrs. Cahanin takes out those pictures of her daughter&#39;s<br/>\nbruised buttocks. With sorrow, she recalls a moment months before when Megan<br/>\nwas playing school in her room, swinging a fly-swatter at her dolls&#39;<br/>\nbacksides, and wishes she had signed a paper that would have prohibited<br/>\npaddling her daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nMegan, sitting on her parents&#39; back porch watching a downpour hit Toledo<br/>\nBend Lake, said, &quot;You try to forget about it, but sometimes you just can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s so painful seeing that lady every day,&quot; she said. &quot;Whenever I see a<br/>\npaddle, I just move away.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe New York Times<br/>\n<br/>\n Blessings,<br/>\nSusan<br/>\nwife to Jerry<br/>\nmom to Zach, Jessica, Nathan, Hannah, Rachel and Benjamin<br/>\n<br/>\nDahlem&#39;s Handcrafted Soaps<br/>\nwww.dahlemshandcraftedsoap.com<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You&#39;ll learn things in this house that they&#39;ll never teach you in school&quot;<br/>\nAunt Frances ~ Practical Magic</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20625,"nextTopicId":20643}}
