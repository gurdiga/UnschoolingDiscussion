He said we shouldn&#39;t drink milk with fish,<br/>\nso we had lemonade or soda or water with those meals.  Sure didn&#39;t bother us<br/>\nkids!  I never thought to ask him why.  He did eat clam chowder made with<br/>\nmilk though - that is milk and shellfish.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ate a lot of fish and shellfish when I was a kid, living in the Puget<br/>\nSound area.  As an adult, I lived in Alaska for 9 years and ate lots of King<br/>\ncrab, Dungeoness crab, salmon, and scallops, besides shrimp and halibut.<br/>\nThe kids there used to say, &quot;do we have to have halibut for dinner again?&quot;<br/>\nEveryone in Kodiak fished or had friends that fished, so most people had<br/>\nfreezers full of fish (and venison too).  I also worked briefly in salmon,<br/>\ncrab, and shrimp canneries.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mil used to make salmon patties.  Leftover or canned salmon mixed with<br/>\nmashed potatoes, then so much salt and pepper that it was all you could<br/>\ntaste.  Dh loves it when I make them, except that I tone down the salt and<br/>\npepper so you can still taste the fish.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nFish lover for as long as I can remember...</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62590,"nextTopicId":62606}}
