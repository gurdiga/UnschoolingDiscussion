At those times<br/>\n&gt; my mother would encourage me (but not insist) to go, even if I would rather<br/>\n&gt; stay home; she didn&#39;t know there were other options in the 60&#39;s.  Grades<br/>\n&gt; were unimportant to them.  I watched as much tv as I wanted, in fact, I was<br/>\n&gt; one of the only kids I knew who had unlimited access to television,<br/>\n&gt; including a television in my room -- and I watched a lot of tv!  I went to<br/>\n&gt; bed when I wanted, I ate what I wanted, etc...  My parents trusted my<br/>\n&gt; judgments, and let me make my own decisions.
