Congratulations to your daughter.  Sometimes if you are<br/>\njust willing to ask, people are willing to work with you.  My girls and I<br/>\nwork together at the barn where we board our horse in exchange for boarding<br/>\ncosts.  It is so worth it and we just love the work.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8 yo dd who had had a riding accident (badly sprained hand and loss of<br/>\nconfidence) about a year and a half ago, is once again confident in her<br/>\nriding.  It is so great to see her come back and exceed where she was before<br/>\nher fall.  She is now beginning to canter on our horse and you can see her<br/>\nrenewed confidence in her whole posture and seat.  It is so rewarding.  Now<br/>\nthat the girls can ride so much more frequently than they used to, they are<br/>\nprogressing quickly in their abilities and it is so much fun to watch them.<br/>\nIt&#39;s almost like you can see the differences from day to day.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":203597060,"authorName":"janethamlin@sbcglobal.net","from":"&lt;janethamlin@...&gt;","profile":"jefhdvm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"She got a job!","postDate":"1110206600","msgId":104222,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzMzkwMWM1MjMyNCQwMmRlZDU0MCQwYjAxYThjMEBKQU5FVEhBTUxJTj4=","referencesHeader":"PDExMTAxOTY1NTUuNTEyLjQxMjc4Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":104228,"prevInTime":104221,"nextInTime":104223,"topicId":104222,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just a little brag.

She&#39;s head-over-heels in love with horses (like many girls her age) and has been begging for more riding time.  Well, finances are tight just to pay for the lessons she&#39;s getting.  So...<br/>\n<br/>\nShe asked at the barn if she could volunteer to work so that she could ride more, and they said yes!  So she spent 6 hours there on Saturday, working a lot and then riding, and yesterday after her lesson she spent 3 hours working, mucking stalls, washing food bowls, and sweeping.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re going to see if she can go on a weekday as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nJanet<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104209,"nextTopicId":104229}}
