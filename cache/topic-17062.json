A king size \n  waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 sq foot <br>house 4 inches \n  deep.<br><br>2. If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with \n  <br>roller blades, they can ignite.<br><br>3. A 3 year olds voice is louder \n  than 200 adults in a crowded <br>restaurant.<br><br>4. If you hook a dog leash \n  over a ceiling fan, the motor is not <br>strong enough to rotate a 42 pound \n  boy wearing Batman underwear and a <br>Superman cape. It is strong enough, \n  however, .if tied to a paint can, <br>to spread paint over all four wal1s of a \n  20 by 20 foot room.<br><br>5. You should not throw baseballs up when the \n  ceiling fan is on. When <br>using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw \n  the ball. up a few <br>times before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a \n  baseball .a long <br>way.<br><br>6. The glass in windows (even double pane) \n  doesn&#39;t stop a baseball <br>hit by a ceiling fan.<br><br>7. When you hear the \n  toilet flush and the words &quot;&#39;Oh--oh, &quot; it&#39;s <br>already too late.<br><br>8. \n  Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it.<br><br>9. A six \n  year old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a 36 <br>year old man \n  says they can only do it in the movies. A magnifying <br>glass can start a \n  fire even on an overcast day.<br><br>10. Certain LEGOs will pass through the \n  digestive tract of a four <br>year old.<br><br>11. Play Dough and Microwave \n  should never be used in the same <br>sentence.<br><br>12. Super glue is \n  forever.<br><br>13. No matter how much Jello you put in a. swimming pool, you \n  still <br>can&#39;t walk on water.<br><br>14. Pool filters do not like \n  Jello<br><br>15. VCR&#39;s do not eject PB&amp;J sandwiches even though TV \n  commercials <br>show they do.<br><br>16. Garbage bags do not make good \n  parachutes.<br><br>17. Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when \n  driving<br><br>18. You probably do not want to know what that odor \n  is.<br><br>19. Always look in the oven before you turn it on. Plastic toys do \n  <br>not like ovens.<br><br>20. The fire department in Austin, TX has a 5 \n  minute response time.<br><br>21. The spin cycle on the washing machine does \n  not make earth worms <br>dizzy.<br><br>22. It will however make cats \n  dizzy.<br><br>23.
