It really made me think.  Your <br/>\ndescription of your childhood, your insight into your parents&#39; reasons for <br/>\nbeing the way they were, your empathy for yourself and your siblings and even <br/>\nyour parents...you have really developed a wisdom about all this.  Your <br/>\nanswer for finding a better way...that is, accepting yourself fully and being <br/>\nkind to yourself...makes so much sense.  Thanks again for sharing this and <br/>\nI&#39;m glad you&#39;ve joined the group here.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Lucy in Calif.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bonknit@xxx.xxx","from":"Bonknit@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"uxFlbsAgK6i7y0fNVDXfSjamYz2ZkojCEBNERHxRal5p84IJQ4DkEecXmGHHSTwBcCv1WYg1","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: witnessing/childhood trauma (children charged...thre...","postDate":"943473575","msgId":4806,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMTIuNDgwNi45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4808,"prevInTime":4805,"nextInTime":4807,"topicId":4806,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/24/99 11:34:48 AM Eastern Standard Time, tmartin@realtime.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-852220371\">In a message dated 11/24/99 11:34:48 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tmartin@...\">tmartin@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; most<br/>\n people want to believe that this kind of thing is perpetrated due to cold<br/>\n heartedness, the need for control or disdain for the kids.  my experience is<br/>\n that it&#39;s actually not that personal (but it&#39;s extremely difficult not to <br/>\ntake<br/>\n it that way),  that it&#39;s the parents&#39; inability to handle the stresses of <br/>\ntheir<br/>\n own choices.  it&#39;s not that they don&#39;t love you or that you are not lovable,<br/>\n it&#39;s just that their own needs are so big and out of control they can&#39;t even<br/>\n begin to realize you have any.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I think we lived the same life.
