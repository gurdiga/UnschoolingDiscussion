No dressing up; no begging for candy; no handing out <br/>\ncandy (or anything else) If it isn&#39;t, then why make up some <br/>\nbig &quot;baptized&quot; version of it? sheesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree; if Christians are going to define Halloween as evil, they shouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave anything to do with it at all.  Doing so &quot;compromises&quot; your belief <br/>\nsystem, in my opinion.  However, so many Christians believe so many different <br/>\nthings, such as total immersion baptism or sprinkling of water - what about babies <br/>\nbeing baptized?  There&#39;s a hot topic with Christians.  Oh, here&#39; s a really hot <br/>\ntopic-once saved always saved???  I think God looks at our hearts and the <br/>\nintent we have when we commit an act.  The Bible is too conflicting in its&#39; <br/>\nstatements.  You can support each idea by searching through Scriptures and taking <br/>\nthem out of context-sometimes even in context.  I personally don&#39;t look at <br/>\nHalloween as evil.  To my family, it is just a fun time to dress up and go <br/>\ntrick-or-treating.  And I even let my kids be whatever they want to be, whether it is <br/>\na witch, a demon, a ghost-whatever.  For this reason, we don&#39;t go to church <br/>\nfall festivals.  If you want to welcome people I don&#39;t believe you can put <br/>\nstipulations on the welcome mat.  At least not at church.  In my own home, I&#39;ll <br/>\ndecide what parameters I want.  As I write that it sounds like a double <br/>\nstandard, but I reason it with &quot;but I&#39;m not God.  I&#39;m not all forgiving and all loving <br/>\nand all accepting.  I&#39;m not willing to die on the cross for the entire <br/>\nworld.&quot;  Does that make sense, or am I making excuses?<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108663,"nextTopicId":108741}}
