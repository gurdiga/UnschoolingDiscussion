I know people who have homeschooled for years that rarely visit the library and NEVER purchase a book.  They&#39;ve never even read any homeschooling books!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my house, there is a library/study with one whole wall full of books.  In the basement/kids room there are 6 large freestanding bookshelves FULL.  Each child has bookshelves in their room full of books.  The family room hearth has 2 large boxes we try to keep the library books in (so we don&#39;t loose them &lt;g&gt;).  And that&#39;s not even thinking of the books in the car, on the couch, lying about on every horizontal surface in the house!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nFolks who still don&#39;t use books will probably never understand how wonderful the internet is.  In my mind it&#39;s just another VERY large library at my fingertips!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96795689,"authorName":"tuckervill@aol.com","from":"tuckervill@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] about the internet, and unschooling, and","postDate":"1037588806","msgId":50036,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE0LjJmOTBjY2QzLjJiMDliMzQ2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":50035,"nextInTopic":50065,"prevInTime":50035,"nextInTime":50037,"topicId":50025,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/17/2002 8:37:17 PM Central Standard Time, ...
