If you stress\nthe importance of some &#39;subjects&#39; by insisting on the child learning them,\nthen then you can&#39;t &#39;unschool&#39; another &#39;subject&#39; without saying, in effect,\nthat this subject is less important than the ones you teach - that you\ndon&#39;t trust the child to know what s/he wants / needs to learn.\n<p>And yet I too struggle with maths. Because I don&#39;t understand it, because\nI don&#39;t like it, and because I have found the need for it in my own life.\nYet I have to wonder: is my inability as an old dog to learn the new maths\ntricks I need, not directly related to the misery of those enforced math\nlessons of my childhood? Is it not precisely because I was made to try\nand learn stuff that was at that time totally irrelevant and uninteresting,\nthat I became math phobic? So is it not better to leave math as an interesting\npossibility for future learning, than to try and force it on the unwilling?\n<p>And yet..... I worry..... The theory of unschooling is a lot easier\nthan the living of it, for those of us who are school damaged &lt;sigh&gt;.\n<p>Carol\n<br>in New Zealand\n \n</p></span></blockquote></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7706,"nextTopicId":7726}}
