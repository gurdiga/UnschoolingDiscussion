No they bug to hit the library several times a week, but like <br/>\nBarnes and Noble, they don&#39;t go for the books. They love the little store in the <br/>\nlibrary that sells books way cheap and they have all kinds of pencils, pens, <br/>\nstickers and well...stuff. That&#39;s where they head first. Then they hit the DVD&#39;s <br/>\nand VHS section, lastly they hit the CD section. Every once in  awhile, <br/>\nthey&#39;ll ask me to grab them some cartooning books while they look for movies. Once <br/>\nI asked on a day that I did not want to be at the library for long, &quot;Why don&#39;t <br/>\nyou go find your cartooning books and I&#39;ll look at some movies?&quot; In twin <br/>\nspeak, they responded, &quot; Why mom?... It would waste so much time for us to look up <br/>\nthe decimals for the cartooning books... and you almost know the whole place <br/>\nby heart...so if you just go get them,... it will be so much faster,... then <br/>\nyou will have time to look for movies too.&quot; They weren&#39;t being obnoxious, they <br/>\nreally thought in the essence of saving time we should do it their way. I <br/>\nagreed that my knowing where those particular books are would be faster and maybe <br/>\nthey should go with me to see where they are and then they will know too. So <br/>\nwe did and now they too know where to go to find those books in particular.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda - ready to hit the library herself<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Mother of two,have questions regarding reading","postDate":"1056396637","msgId":75238,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxNmEwMWMzMzliZSRjNzUwM2RjMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGEzLjQzZjkyZGY5LjJjMjg4MzhiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":75244,"prevInTime":75237,"nextInTime":75239,"topicId":75238,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... me ... to ... just ... for ... books ... responded with, ... they ... knows ...
