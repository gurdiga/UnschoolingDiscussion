Oh, my heart goes out to you because I have *SO* been there! I remember once I drove past my own house several times, I was in such a state of confusion. ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1887701197\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;    From: Amy Spang &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aspang1@...\">aspang1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since the subject of nursing has come up, I wonder if anyone else is<br/>\n&gt; having a problem with very frequent night time nursing?  My 16 mo. old<br/>\n&gt; wakes up to nurse every 2-3 hours every night like clockwork , and I am<br/>\n&gt; getting so tired I&#39;m afraid to get behind the wheel to drive anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, my heart goes out to you because I have *SO* been there! I remember once<br/>\nI drove past my own house several times, I was in such a state of confusion.<br/>\nThere were times I felt out of my mind because of lack of sleep. My son woke<br/>\nup about every 45 minutes to an hour for the first couple of years. All I<br/>\ncan tell you is that this *will* pass. This age - 12 months to about 18<br/>\nmonths - seems to be one of the hardest for night nursings. A lot of growth,<br/>\n2 year molars, a ton of cognitive development, I think these things all<br/>\ncombine to make babies of this age more wakeful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t keep him in our bed because we get even less sleep (our bed is<br/>\n&gt; small) and I have talked to people who say, &quot;Let him nurse as much as he<br/>\n&gt; wants at night,&quot; and others (like the pediatrician) who say, &quot; Cut him<br/>\n&gt; off right now or he will never learn to get to sleep on his own&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I have to say that I disagree with the latter. I think especially as<br/>\nunschoolers, we probably all are struggling to realize that we really don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to &quot;teach&quot; our kids much at all, they *will* learn it or do it when<br/>\nthey are ready, no matter what society or the &quot;experts&quot; say. My son sleeps a<br/>\nsolid 9 hours straight now and he was the worst nighttime waker of all time!<br/>\nI remember well the day he asked for his own bed in his own room. I was<br/>\namazed, proud, sad, happy. Of course, he still comes in at about 6:30 am to<br/>\nsnuggle in our family bed. As others have suggested, you might consider<br/>\ngoing to the mattress-on-the-floor model of sleeping. That&#39;s what we did,<br/>\nthat way you can add and subtract other mattresses as needed to accomodate<br/>\nother bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this advice *never* sounds right at the time, but it really is true<br/>\nthat &quot;this too shall pass&quot;. Some things I found helpful to me were to<br/>\npractice breathing or meditation during night-time nursings and that helped<br/>\nkeep me in a relaxed state so that I could more easily go back to sleep. I<br/>\nalso found that taking all clocks out of the bedroom had a very beneficial<br/>\neffect. When I knew exactly how long it had been since the last nursing, I<br/>\njust got more and more frustrated. Without the clock, I found it easier to<br/>\nbe relaxed about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck to you!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n  -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;What if there was no gravity, but we all held on<br/>\nto something really tight??&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) who says &quot;Odwalla!&quot; (her favorite treat at the store)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14638,"nextTopicId":14651}}
