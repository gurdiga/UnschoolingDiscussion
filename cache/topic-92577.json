My thought is that if they want these toys they<br/>\ncan fashion them from sticks, bats, green rocks, or whatever.  It is one<br/>\nway I have of sharing nonviolent values w/my kids. <br/>\n <br/>\nDo any of you have similar values?  How did you address it with family<br/>\nand friends?  It hasn’t been an issue w/my girl but I expect, based on<br/>\ngiving of vague aunts and uncles to other boys in the family, that with<br/>\nthis birthday (#2) or next it will be an issue.  I’ve spread the word as<br/>\nbest I can, but if such a gift is given, how might I approach it w/out<br/>\ncoming off as rude and irrational?<br/>\n <br/>\nOn a broader note, does it much matter if one has a lot of “learning”<br/>\ntoys around the house vs. toys like electronic VTech toys?  (My family’s<br/>\nfavorite gifts.)  I’m wondering if I should start constructing a<br/>\ndifferent environment or just wait until they ask for these “learning”<br/>\ntoys (tinkertoys, etc.)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI used to be all gung ho about only buying &quot;educational&quot; toys or toys deemed<br/>\nmore worthy by virtue of being &quot;old fashioned&quot; and of high quality - like<br/>\nonly wooden block sets or those personality neutral dolls that are sold for<br/>\nbig $ in some beautifully printed catalogues. I have so totally relaxed. <br/>\nNow the only criteria I use for whether I will buy a toy are: 1/ Jayn (4.5)<br/>\nhas actually asked for it; 2/ We can afford it; 3/ We have the room for it<br/>\nin our apartment. (She can hardly wait for a new room so she can have a<br/>\ndolls&#39; house). *All* her toys are learning tools, and the issue of quality<br/>\nhas been one that I have also let go of. For example, I was only interested<br/>\nin getting her nice paints and real bristle paintbrushes. She asked for the<br/>\nreally cheap little watercolor trays that come with coloring books, and<br/>\nlikes using those awful cheap brushes they come with to scrape on the paper,<br/>\nalong with her good brushes. She has often gotten just as much out of the<br/>\ndolls that come with her Happy Meal, as she has out of her collectible<br/>\nBarbies - and boy do I feel better about her pulling those ones apart to<br/>\nturn them into puppets, or repainting their clothes different colors.<br/>\nActually I let go of my anxiety about her destroying any of her own things,<br/>\nas long as she is doing it deliberately and mindfully - transformation not<br/>\ndestruction. I mean, if she is throwing something in a fury, I try to<br/>\nprevent the damage since I know she will be sorry later, but if she is<br/>\ncutting their hair knowing it won&#39;t grow back - well they are her things,<br/>\nnot mine. She also has a bunch of porcelain dolls, of which she is very<br/>\ncareful.<br/>\nHow does Jayn discover the toys she wants? TV, internet, catalogues,<br/>\nbrowsing at stores, visiting friends, seeing some toy/tool Daddy has bought<br/>\nfor himself. Least successful: adults buying her some unseen or unasked for<br/>\ntoy and giving it to her as a surprise. Sometimes she gets downright angry<br/>\nand insists we take it back to the store.<br/>\nI have always disliked those electronic toys along the lines of Lets Pretend<br/>\nElmo (is that the right name?) that direct the child&#39;s play. I think<br/>\ndisliking them allowed me to feel superior somehow. Jayn solves that problem<br/>\nwith pretty much all the dolls she has that talk, by choosing to switch them<br/>\noff. What a concept: she is in charge of her own playing and there is no<br/>\n&quot;right&quot; way to use any of it! I can trust her to use all her stuff in ways<br/>\nfar beyond the instructions. And her enormously expensive plain wood blocks<br/>\n(a gift from grandparents) have a bunch of drawing and coloring on them.<br/>\nDo &quot;violent&quot; toys create violent nasty children? Does seemingly violent role<br/>\nplaying in games, electronic or physical, create violent people without a<br/>\ngrasp of limits in other real situations (ie psychopaths)? All of my<br/>\nexperience observing gently parented and unschooled children says &quot;no&quot;<br/>\nresoundingly. <br/>\nHowever, nor does the absence of these violent toys guarantee having a child<br/>\nwho is universally non-violent in her regular behavior either. The &quot;worst&quot;<br/>\nwe have are some plastic &quot;Medieval&quot; swords and shields from Ikea that we<br/>\nplay with together, and I like them better than sticks because the swords<br/>\nare blunted, and the shields guard ones hands from whacks. They sit on the<br/>\nshelf for many months at a time. She has a couple of toy armored vehicles -<br/>\nbut it is about them being battery operated and they could just as well be<br/>\npainted with pink polka dots as army camouflage colors. She has self limited<br/>\nthe violent type toys, by not wanting any of them. Her preferred<br/>\nvideo/computer games are Barbie and Princesses. She asks me to fast forward<br/>\nthrough scary violent moments on her DVD&#39;s. She has never been hit or<br/>\npunished, although I have shouted at her sometimes, and am working on that.<br/>\nShe will hit me across the head when frustrated, and sometimes laughs while<br/>\ndoing it - exploring her own power? Testing my limits? She has turned those<br/>\ninnocuous &quot;educational&quot; toys into dangerous projectiles, but it is all<br/>\ndirected at me, or her father - safe targets I guess. It has been a long<br/>\ntime since she has kicked or hit another child while playing - and it was<br/>\nsometimes provoked at the time. She sometimes still gets excited with sand<br/>\ntossing, throwing it up into the air, and this escalates into throwing at<br/>\npeople - but I step in (as I have mentioned in other posts).<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

And for me unschooling has never meant shutting things out but rather learning all I can about them so there&#39;s balance. You may not have that balance right now in regards to swords and guns. Maybe some reading on the art of swordmaking. How about the physics involved? And why the variety?If swords are just gloryfied sharp sticks why would one person or culture require a wide curved blade, another a long, slim one, another a huge thing that you need both hands and strong shoulders for?  What about the roles that guns have played in history. Gun barrels grew to ridiculous amounts here in NA when natives would trade a stack of beaver pelts that had to match the length of a rifle...a good reflection of the lack of respect shown to a native trading partners in the last century. Are guns and sword really just about violence or is that just how you see them. My interest in swords and bows has brought me to history, Shakespeare, science, politics, etc. Not much violence as a result though.<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7143857,"authorName":"jrossedd@aol.com","from":"jrossedd@...","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] transcripts","postDate":"1081990311","msgId":92611,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhYS4yMjk1MjAxNS4yZGFmMzZhN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":92610,"nextInTopic":92613,"prevInTime":92610,"nextInTime":92612,"topicId":92577,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He told me<br/>\n&gt; that if an unschooled kid made up a transcript that made it look like<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;d taken classes and gotten grades, and if he found out later that<br/>\n&gt; it was all made up, that they&#39;d consider the kid had gotten in<br/>\n&gt; fraudulently and they&#39;d evict him from the school. He said he wanted<br/>\n&gt; the truth about what the kid had been busy doing during those years,<br/>\n&gt; not something made up. He said that courses listed and graded by a<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling parent didn&#39;t mean much to him anyway because ALL<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling parents pretty much give their kids all &quot;A&#39;s.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; AND he said he&#39;d be FAR more likely to take a close look at a kid<br/>\n&gt; without a traditional transcript, too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When we chose to unschool, we chose to NOT school and that meant we<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t get the trappings of school. So - to later make up something that<br/>\n&gt; implies that we DID school, that is clearly dishonest. I&#39;d far rather<br/>\n&gt; have my kid never go to college then to go based on a complete<br/>\n&gt; fabrication like that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But it really is not a choice of &quot;lie or miss out&quot; - to create a<br/>\n&gt; transcript that describes what the child REALLY did, that is honest and<br/>\n&gt; can be pretty wonderful, is very possible. It doesn&#39;t have to list<br/>\n&gt; courses he didn&#39;t take with grades he didn&#39;t earn and it doesn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; to be done under the pretense that he &quot;did school.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you ask them, colleges will say, &quot;Yes, he must have a transcript.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; But the transcript can very often be a narrative, not a course/grade<br/>\n&gt; listing. Even when they want it in a more traditional format, it can be<br/>\n&gt; without grades, just a list of subjects that the kid has spent time<br/>\n&gt; learning something about during the previous few years. It certainly<br/>\n&gt; does not have to be a course list divided into semesters with credits<br/>\n&gt; and grades EVEN if the college says that is what they want, when they<br/>\n&gt; actually get the application, they&#39;ll review it. IF the student has<br/>\n&gt; high SAT or ACT scores, they will barely look at it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There ARE universities that will not take homeschoolers based on<br/>\n&gt; coursework at all - unschoolers or otherwise. University of California<br/>\n&gt; is one of those. They have coursework that is required and it has to be<br/>\n&gt; pre-certified that it meets their requirements. This means they have to<br/>\n&gt; have, in advance, approved the textbooks and subject matter for the<br/>\n&gt; courses. Most public schools have had their courses approved and some<br/>\n&gt; private schools. But there is no way an unschooler is going to qualify<br/>\n&gt; based on &quot;coursework&quot;. Still, unschoolers get into UCLA and Berkeley<br/>\n&gt; and other UC&#39;s all the time.
