My dd is the one who has struggled with this the most.  She would talk about going back (we took them out of ps three years ago) after a long busy day - or when older brother didn&#39;t spend as much time with her.  We tried the local hs group but it was not a good fit...very religion based.  It has taken some time for her to find herself -- I know this is different from your situation as your kids have never been in school....I can only say that by the time morning came for us her outlook was always much better.  A new day - getting involved in something alone, with older brother, or me......feeling comfortable and relaxed and in her own environment again seemed to help the most.  Listening and not getting the &quot;deer in the headlights&quot; look when she needed to talk about it allowed her to open up and express her loneliness.  If you asked her today about going back ---- you would get a big resounding NO!  Getting comfortable in her own skin (not what other school friends &quot;thought&quot; she should be) has shown her she truly doesn&#39;t want to be like them.  She enjoys playing with a lot of other kids but has no need to fit in.  Recently some other kids moved in nearby.  This very shy girl marched outside and introduced herself.....they&#39;ve spent every weekend together since.  The greatest gift for me has been watching her confidence in herself grow - she is very happy with who she is and what she wants.<br/>\nJinger<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patti.schmidt2@...\">patti.schmidt2@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, May 14, 2003 12:05 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] unschooling as not &quot;normal&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Last night, after a long tiring day trip and a few tense family <br/>\n  moments, I was laying in bed with my 8 and 10 yo sons.

It helps them when they start comparing themselves to <br/>\ntheir peers.
