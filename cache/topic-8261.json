An organization with good <br/>\nvolunteer management practices (volunteers are equal to paid staff in value, <br/>\nare regularly appreciated both publicly and privately, are expected to act <br/>\nprofessionally, and are given performance reviews, etc) is an especially good <br/>\nplace to start, if that&#39;s available to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he would be ready and confident and have references for when he wants to <br/>\nstrike out into activities he chooses for himself.  I have found that with <br/>\nmost people, if the child acts sure of him/herself, that people will respond <br/>\nin a positive manner.  Assuming, of course, that sureness is not simply <br/>\narrogance, but brings with it respect for others :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hjshaltz@...\">hjshaltz@...</a><br/>\nHJS Studio and Shaltz Farm Shetlands and Angora Rabbits<br/>\nList Mom, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FiberFlock@onelist.com\">FiberFlock@onelist.com</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FiberProfessionals@onelist.com\">FiberProfessionals@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8265,"nextTopicId":8268}}
