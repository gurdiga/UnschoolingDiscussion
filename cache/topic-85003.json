We did one when we were broken down in a teeny town in South Dakota once.  <br/>\nTwo teams looked for things like a piece of a car, a dead animal, a gum <br/>\nwrapper (three days by a freeway exit with one book and some crayons and paper--it <br/>\nwas bad &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis Halloween Kirby and Marty were at a Halloween party in a rural area and <br/>\nthere was a scavenger hunt.  The hostess had made three teams and assigned <br/>\npeople to them so that each team had someone old enough to drive others around, <br/>\nand at least one kid local to that area, and one kid very brave.  Some of the <br/>\nthings on the list were two rolls of toilet paper, four McDonald&#39;s french fri<br/>\nes, a sock (extra points if it&#39;s orange), a carrot, a raw egg (Marty <br/>\ntrick-or-treated for those--asked the guy if they could please have a carrot and an egg <br/>\ninstead of candy), and  a rubbing of a tombstone (they had been given paper and <br/>\ncrayon--one team went to the pet cemetary and got a German Shepherd&#39;s that <br/>\ndied in the 70&#39;s, and one team found the grave of a woman who had lived to be <br/>\n102 or so).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s another thing I first encountered in Girl Scouts but we do it in the <br/>\nSCA too sometimes, and in the SCA they call the quests.  (They might have in <br/>\nscouts too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are stations, with someone at each station having a question or puzzle <br/>\nfor the questers.   They might have to answer a riddle, or know something <br/>\nhistorical.  I remember in girl scouts we had to set up a campfire with stuff that <br/>\nwas nearby, and one of the tricks was to put the bucket near enough and say <br/>\n&quot;bucket of water or dirt&quot; or whatever.   We had to put lay scout pins and <br/>\npatches out in the right order on a sash.   In the SCA, there have been chess <br/>\npuzzles (one move to checkmate) and tell a period joke or sing a period song, name <br/>\nfive kings of France before 1600; stuff like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I have 3 small children (6g, 4g and 3b), and I wanted to make up a <br/>\nscavenger hunt for some trips that we&#39;re taking to Boston and Williamsburg <br/>\nnext month.

Maybe you could look through <br/>\ntour guides and make a list of things you think you will easily come by (and if <br/>\nyou&#39;re getting tired it could inspire you to keep going.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKids that young are not going to care about lots of things.  Maybe you could <br/>\nlist things like three bells, a church older than 1800, an old boat, a new <br/>\nboat, a ferry (if you&#39;re going to see one), a mile marker, a horse...

There is something <br/>\ncalled &quot;geocaching&quot; where you use your GPS to find locations and <br/>\nhidden &#39;treasures&#39; (boxes).   They are located in countries all over <br/>\nthe world.<br/>\n   Check out the website: www.geocaching.com   Look up some local <br/>\nsites in your city/state and get an idea for what this about.  <br/>\nYou&#39;ll be able to look up Boston and Williamsburg as well.   They&#39;ll <br/>\nhave clues and coded hints that you can print out (for example, once <br/>\nyou get to the location, the coded clue might tell you to look under <br/>\nsome old railroad ties).<br/>\n   We took a weekend trip to Idaho (from Washington) and I printed <br/>\nout a bunch of &#39;caches&#39; (my kids call them &#39;treasure hunts&#39;) that <br/>\nwere on our way.  We stopped at rest stops and funny locations, <br/>\nfound the box, signed our names in the notebook, left a little <br/>\ntrinket, took a trinket (kids love this part) and we were back on <br/>\nour way.<br/>\n  That was our first time doing it on a trip.  Usually we just do it <br/>\nhere locally and on day trips to Seattle.  There are so many local <br/>\ncaches, it is going to take us a while to find them all.  Plus, new <br/>\nones are added (by anyone who takes the initiative) all the time.  <br/>\n    It is very simple.  Kids automatically learned about longitude <br/>\nand latitude.  Good for tracking, street smarts, adventure and FUN!!<br/>\n <br/>\nDoes anyone else do this?
