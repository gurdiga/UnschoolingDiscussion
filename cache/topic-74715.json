I don&#39;t do ww, (I can&#39;t afford it) but I&#39;m trying to combine the principle with what I read here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot buy junk and then just eat it whenever I want it without being *aware* of what I&#39;m eating and how much or I gain weight every time I do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, it is about portions and increasing exercise.  I&#39;ve just started monitoring my food intake about a month ago just to see what I&#39;m eating, and how much.  I&#39;ve increased my exercise quite a bit over the last week.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that I can comfortably eat at the 1800 cal range.  That means I am careful, but not depriving myself at all.  I&#39;m aware that I have to make choices.  Sometimes I might want chips...but not *that* bad.  so I pick something else instead.  If I REALLY want chips, I eat some...but try to be aware of portions.  And if I really binge on them, I make sure I compensate later.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll see if it works or not in a few months!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74714,"nextTopicId":74722}}
