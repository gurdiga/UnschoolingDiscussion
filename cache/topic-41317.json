I went to the first <br/>\nmeeting of the neighborhood homeschool group, &quot;Southeast Area Family <br/>\nEducators&quot;---sounds &quot;SAFE&quot; enough, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this &quot;meeting of the moms&quot;, we discussed field trips, curricula, and other <br/>\nyawners. Then we had a &quot;test&quot;. Hmmmmm. We were asked how long we had <br/>\nhomeschooled, how many children we had, their ages, our favorite color, etc. <br/>\nThen we were asked to name our favorite Christian author and our favorite <br/>\nChristian artist.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, if the light were dim earlier, it was shining brightly now!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I feebly wrote in CS Lewis for my Favorite Christian author (as he is the <br/>\nONLY one I knew!). I had to leave the favorite Christian artist blank because <br/>\nI couldn&#39;t even think of a ONE---Picasso? Michelangelo? Van Gogh? Chagall? <br/>\nWarhol? Peter Max??? I left it blank. Little did I know they meant MUSICAL <br/>\nartist!!! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHad to draw the line at the request to sign a statement of faith.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41316,"nextTopicId":41288}}
