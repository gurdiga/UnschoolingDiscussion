I wanted to comment and share an idea: video journaling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep a journal for ME and I like to brag about what my children are<br/>\nlearning or doing, when I recognize learning, or WHEN they are learning or<br/>\ndoing something.    I guess it&#39;s a defensive journal... LOL  I also write<br/>\nabout my &quot;paradigm shift&quot; from traditional schooling to unschooling, because<br/>\nI am still in the SHIFT, you know?  I&#39;m teetering in and out of both mind<br/>\nsets?  (I have a degree in elementary ed. so I am tipping the swing-set)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did something yesterday that I have to share.  We were transferring<br/>\nfamily video footage onto VHS tapes when I realized that we could<br/>\nmake ------ VIDEO JOURNALS!<br/>\n<br/>\nI taped my daughter reading a book to the baby.  While she read another<br/>\nbook, the baby pretended to read.  Then my daughter started showing off her<br/>\nartwork.  We now have all this cool stuff on video.  My son came in and<br/>\nstarted to &quot;show off&quot; too.  He went from talking about books he had read to<br/>\ndoing handstands and tricks on his scooter.  Then I filmed all the kids<br/>\nriding their scooters or big wheels in our driveway.  They actually shared<br/>\nduring the footage, which I made a note of.  hee hee<br/>\n<br/>\nI think every few weeks we will do this and have an ongoing VIDEO JOURNAL of<br/>\nwhat we are learning and making. I have one tape with about 15 minutes of<br/>\nfootage so far and I hope to add every few months or when something exciting<br/>\nis going on...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s so much fun to watch the kids showing off to the camera.<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n<br/>\nShifting to unschooling mom of Matthan 11, Kelsey 7, and Christian 2.5<br/>\n(still nursing)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91863,"nextTopicId":91830}}
