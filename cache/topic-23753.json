I think I would laugh at my husband if he asked me to <br/>\nprove anything, after all I&#39;m a grown up not his daughter and don&#39;t have to <br/>\nprove anything to him.  My husband trusts me when it comes to our kids that I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do anything to harm them, that&#39;s one of the reasons we chose each <br/>\nother and decided to have a family together because of our common belief that <br/>\nour children would be well taken care of by either of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for family members that make comments...

I&#39;ve had some women say &quot;my husband doesn&#39;t believe in astrology&quot;.  When <br/>\nI ask them &quot;how long has he been studying it?&quot; (knowing full well the answer <br/>\nis he hasn&#39;t).... They just laugh and then I say &quot;so how can you make a <br/>\njudgment about a subject that you have no knowledge of&quot;....  Perhaps if these <br/>\n&quot;husbands&quot; and &quot;family members&quot; who have to be &quot;proven&quot; to spent as much time <br/>\ninvestigating homeschooling rather than criticising it, they would see it <br/>\nworks.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to go and read my new John Grisham novel while DH reads the kids a <br/>\ngoodnight book, baths them and puts them to bed.
