This conversation about your husbands work is a biggie.  When<br/>\nthis level of stuff comes up -- I&#39;m with you -- that all the sensitivity<br/>\nand thought can make it a real learning and healing point.    Two things<br/>\ncome to mind.  !st -- how great that he has come out with his concern and<br/>\nis praying for help and safety for his father.  I might try to transform<br/>\nthis into a blessing for his health and safety (instead of the &quot;not get<br/>\nshot&quot;  -- on the other hand this sounds like something he may need to be<br/>\nable to say!).  I might offer &quot;Please bless Daddy and all the folks he<br/>\nmeets tonight.  Keep them safe and help them find good ways to work out all<br/>\ntheir problems.&quot;  The 2nd thing I thought of was that many people have<br/>\nconcerns for the safety of loved ones when they are working, for all sorts<br/>\nof reasons.  Not that your son needs to be made aware of other dangers and<br/>\nconcerns, but it might be another refernece point that helps you expand the<br/>\nsense that others are with him praying for peace in the world.  Good luck<br/>\nwith this.<br/>\nAnd thanks for including us in this thoughtful and important discussion!<br/>\nBlessed Be Amy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Corallyn Berger","from":"Corallyn Berger &lt;hape2day@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"4NCP7RY8FCkog4BOKs1kZxgaF0GNDdCaJkq_vwtAc3gqXZuwTv7O9TnTgVu_wY4CT53pQzWwTa6NkrExBeATYmLYvA_F9w9drmGw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Son&#39;s praying for daddy","postDate":"963294116","msgId":10972,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNzExMDU0MTU2LjIwODczLnFtYWlsQHdlYjkwNi5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":10976,"prevInTime":10971,"nextInTime":10973,"topicId":10972,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a situation in my home and I doubt any of you can relate to it but maybe someone has a suggestion as to how to handle this situation.

My DH is a police<br/>\nofficer. And my 5yo son is very aware of what daddy<br/>\ndoes. We have been very open with him about it. It is<br/>\nhard not to be when 5 days a week he sees daddy put on<br/>\nhis uniform with full gear and head out the door for<br/>\nwork. Well, the other night when DS was saying his<br/>\nbedtime prayers one of the things he said was to bless<br/>\ndaddy not to get shot. He has never said this in his<br/>\nprayers before and it really took me by surprize. I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know what to say to him. Bed time is often<br/>\ndifficult because he misses daddy. So I asked him if<br/>\nthat was the reason that he misses daddy so much at<br/>\nbedtime and he said it was. He&#39;s afraid that DH will<br/>\nget shot at work. DS has also said in the past that he<br/>\nthinks that DH sits and shoots bad people all night<br/>\nlong. We have tried to explain to him that this is not<br/>\nthe case. I don&#39;t think he gets  it though. The other<br/>\nnight I didn&#39;t want to say that DH wouldn&#39;t get shot<br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t know that won&#39;t happen. That is<br/>\npossible however small that likelyhood is. I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to say this will never happen and then it does.<br/>\nThen DS will think I lied to him and he will be right.<br/>\nI asked him if I could have some time to think about<br/>\nit and then give him and answer. He said that was<br/>\nfine. When I talked to DH about it he didn&#39;t want to<br/>\nmake an issue of it with DS. He was afraid that if we<br/>\nsaid anything more to him or made a big deal about it<br/>\nthen it would further dramatize the idea in DS&#39;s head.<br/>\nI feel differently. I told him I would think on it and<br/>\nthen give him and answer and that is what I feel I<br/>\nmust do. Any suggestions as to what to tell DS about<br/>\ndaddy gettin shot at work?<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
