What about what we need?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore you let her go back or make the decision to not let her, find out <br/>\nexactly why, if you can, she wants to go to school. If it&#39;s just because of <br/>\nthe friend situation, then I would go the extra mile and find some people <br/>\nfor her to hang with. It might not be easy and it might take awhile to find <br/>\nsomeone she clicks with, but if she sees you make the effort and joins in, <br/>\nit might be enough for her right now until she finds friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s not just the friend situation and it&#39;s school itself, then what <br/>\nwould it really hurt for her to find out about going back? If it&#39;s anything <br/>\nlike last time, you may have a week of inconvenience. If that&#39;s all it takes <br/>\nfor her to find her way, I don&#39;t think it would be too much to handle. And <br/>\nif she finds she likes it and wants to stay, well your schedule would <br/>\nchange, but if it&#39;s what she desires, isn&#39;t that really what you want her to <br/>\ndo anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.

It has a nice chapter <br/>\non the subject---pointing out that the &quot;socialization&quot; of the <br/>\nclassroom is not what the social mythology claims(there are other <br/>\nbooks and sources out ther---just don&#39;t have them on the top of my <br/>\nhead right now).  How was your classroom experience?  If it was not <br/>\npleasnt share those experiences with her--alot and with true feelings <br/>\nor share experiences you observed of others who were not having a <br/>\ngood experience.It it help balance the social mythology that our kids <br/>\nare bombarded with everywhere(movies, T V, books, and pressure by <br/>\nwell meaning but misguided relatives, etc.).  One point that hit home <br/>\nfor my kids was if the classroom experience is so great why is there <br/>\nso many venues trying to pump kids up---if it was so wonderful the <br/>\nabundance of propoganda would not exist.   Many folks are very, very  <br/>\nlonely in the midst of plenty in the classroom setting---it is not <br/>\nreally set up to support friendships.  While it important to support <br/>\nour children in their decisions, all such important and life altering <br/>\ndecisions should be made with full information.  In this case the <br/>\ninfo readily available is very one sided in support of the classroom; <br/>\none needs to search out and do some careful introspection to bring <br/>\nbalance to the subject.  The classroom works for some, for some it is <br/>\ntruly wonderful---for some it truly misable---for some just not the <br/>\nbest possible option of the way to invest their time and emotional <br/>\nenergy.  It most certainly can be a life altering experience, not <br/>\nonly for the &quot;student&quot; but for the entire family and should be <br/>\napproached with careful consideration.  In our family we consider all <br/>\nmembers to be of equal importance and base our decisions not only how <br/>\nit will effect one but how it will effect others and the group as a <br/>\nwhole. And so I believe you are right to be concerned as to how it <br/>\nwill effect the family; I also believe you have equal right to make a <br/>\nchoice as to what you are willing to involve yourself with as your <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\nI could say much more but have probably said enough already to get <br/>\nmyself in trouble with some.  This is an issue we talked about at <br/>\ngreat length in our family and have seen come up in the homeschool <br/>\ncommunity.  For what it is worth my son went through the same <br/>\nstruggle but after careful research and much soul searching decided <br/>\nto remain home (with a new appreciation for it).  As for loneliness, <br/>\nhe stopped looking for a homeschooler is own age and started to focus <br/>\nhis attention on his areas of interest and has found that friendship <br/>\nis more than folks banding together to try to survive a miserable <br/>\nexperience and that real friends come in a variety of ages.  Really <br/>\nhow many friends do you have that are within nine months of your <br/>\nage?  The  aged/grade level based classroom is an artifically <br/>\ncontrived environment that does not reflect &quot;real life&quot; or &quot;adult&quot; <br/>\nlife.  His life is becoming fuller and richer each day and he is <br/>\ntruly preparing himslf for his future now instead of having to <br/>\nfiguire all this out after &quot;graduation&quot; when there are so many other <br/>\nbig issues on one&#39;s mind that also need attention.  You here and see <br/>\nrepeated the loneliness and confusion that occurs in recent grads <br/>\nwhen they discover that the real world not work the way school did.  <br/>\nHope this gives you food for thought.  And I hope your family finds <br/>\nthe circumstances that work the best for you all, whatever that may <br/>\nbe.  All the best to you and yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbara<br/>\n<br/>\n      --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robyn Carter&quot; <br/>\n&lt;rcarter@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hey ya&#39;ll;<br/>\n&gt; I thought I&#39;d have a million responses to my question about <br/>\n </span></blockquote>J &quot;trying&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; middle school again this year!
