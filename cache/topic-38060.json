With my younger<br/>\nsons personality  I think it would have been fine   he<br/>\nis very laid back and takes things as they come <br/>\nwhereas my first is a everything has to be perfect for<br/>\nhim  personality.

I <br/>\nthink many parents cheer/fool themselves by thinking that these &quot;wars&quot; will <br/>\nresult in close adult relationships, but it doesn&#39;t always work out that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings got &quot;better&quot; when we were in high school---different ones---and had <br/>\ncompletely separate lives.

OTOH, the <br/>\nkids know they have to give me a general idea of where they are going to be, <br/>\njust in case I need to find them. (nine times out of ten, they do) Should <br/>\nthey just hop on their bikes, ride three blocks over to a friends house, go <br/>\ninside to play and I have no idea where they are, then they would get into <br/>\ntrouble. (this would result in no bikes for a week, they would have to walk <br/>\nif they wanted to go somewhere) Darin and one of my friends from down the <br/>\nstreet say that *IF* I kept the kids restricted to our block then I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave that problem.

Everything else came second - from putting on their <br/>\nclothes, to going grocery shopping, to hiking in the woods, to building a <br/>\nfort, to sitting on the couch, to reading. Whatever they were doing, <br/>\nwherever they were going, my friend&#39;s number one thought was &quot;we&#39;re going to <br/>\ndo this co-operatively&quot; and the moment an incident began to brew, she would <br/>\ncurtail whatever the activity was, and focus on the behavior and correct it <br/>\nbefore it got out of hand. If she stuck with her plan I suspect it took a <br/>\nlot less than a year for it to work, but unfortunately, we moved away, and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how it all worked out. But I thought it was a great idea to focus <br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids went through a battling each other stage, long enough for me to <br/>\nrecall thinking life would never change. After far too long a time of me <br/>\nlistening to them yelling and fighting and explanations of he hit me first, <br/>\nshe threw that, he did this, she did that and driving me up the wall, and me <br/>\ntrying many of the suggestions mentioned here on the list already, I tried <br/>\nsomething different. I told them that whenever I heard what I thought was a <br/>\nfight brewing, I would intervene and they would have to stop whatever it is <br/>\nthey were doing and would have to come and sit down with me and either 1) <br/>\nre-enact the preceding scene frame by frame for me so I could get a clear <br/>\npicture of what the problem was and how to resolve it, or 2) each in turn <br/>\nwould tell me his/her side of the story and I would sit as judge after <br/>\nlistening to both sides. I described to them that this was similar to what <br/>\nhappens when adults have fights they can&#39;t or won&#39;t fix on their own - they <br/>\ngo to court and someone sits in judgement; the judge might get it right, but <br/>\nhe might get it wrong. In both scenarios I would get the kids to pinpoint <br/>\nexactly when things started to go wrong, what they could have done to make <br/>\nit head in a better direction, what we could do to ensure it wouldn&#39;t go <br/>\nwrong another time under the same circumstances, and I set it up for them to <br/>\nwatch for key triggers in the future, asking them that when either of them <br/>\nnoticed one of these triggers in the future, to come tell me. As time went <br/>\non, my daughter was better able to see the triggers as they were happening, <br/>\nwhile my son generally didn&#39;t twig to them until after the fact with me <br/>\nhaving to draw it out of him - but the point was, allowing them to take on <br/>\nthe responsibility for their personal well-being was a great experience for <br/>\nall of us - taking this tack eliminated the me against them/them against <br/>\neach other scenario. And one of the best things I thought, was that the <br/>\nconsequence of their actions was no longer anger, but talk, and I always <br/>\nleft it to them to settle the dispute and figure out how justice could best <br/>\nbe served. It dawns on me now that if it was attention from me they were <br/>\nseeking, then they got their reward, because they got oodles of attention <br/>\nfrom me as I listened to their stories of the battle just fought and I can <br/>\nouttalk anyone any day of the week - something they learned from those <br/>\nexperiences.
