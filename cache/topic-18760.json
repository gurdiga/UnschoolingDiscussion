We have six children, 16,14,10,9,3 and 2. We homeschooled for \ntwo years before moving from Massachusetts to Tennessee in the fall of &#39;99. Last \nyear thw kids went to public school, because of moving twice. Once to a rental \nhouse then finally to our home.&nbsp; The 9 year old had never gone to public \nschool and although he did well academically, he had some problems with \ncontrolling teachers threatening him when there was no need. All they had to do \nwas ask him. We are homeschooling again this year except for the 14 year old by \nhis choice. Most of my behavior problems come from this child, and I don&#39;t think \nit is age related. He brings home many cruel jokes and behaviors. How supportive \nis your local school district towards homeschoolers? Are you involved with a \nlocal home schooling group? Maybe you could ask someone there about it? If the \nchildren are asking to come home, it may be best to take them out now.&nbsp;I \ndon&#39;t understand how you could take them out gradually, or do you mean plan it \nout then take them out? What specifically do&nbsp;you fear happening if you take \nthem out now and are they realistic fears? Are you planning on unschooling when \nyou do take them out? Are your concerns curicculum or recordkeeping? Are you \nclear on your states laws? I know lots of questions when you want answers, but \nclarification of your particular concerns will help you to address them. \nPersonally I would take them out as soon as you can.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Johanna</div>\n<div></div></font>Life is the ultimate learning experience!</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#008080 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:walton@...\"\n title=\"walton@...\">walton@...</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Monday, April 16, 2001 12:36 \n  PM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [Unschooling-dotcom] new to \n  this</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>Hi everyone.
