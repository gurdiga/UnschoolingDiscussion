I read stuff often for short time periods <br/>\nthat I consider purely escapist. I also take pleasure in some very stupid TV <br/>\nand other escapist pastimes. Those things are fun and a great way to unwind.  <br/>\nBut, I try hard to be selective about how I spend large amounts of time. If <br/>\nI&#39;m going to spend a lot of time on something, I want it to be memorable, <br/>\nenlightening or productive. One chapter of Tom Sawyer or an E.L. Doktorow <br/>\nbook are worth ten R.L Stine books or true romance novels. One half hour of <br/>\nNPR news is worth more than 10 episodes of a soap opera. There really is a <br/>\nreason why Mark Twain is constantly quoted and R.L. Stine is not.  One way to <br/>\nthink of it is food for thought. Are you on a steady diet of real nourishing <br/>\nfood (for the mind and spirit)with a delicious desert or candy treat <br/>\noccasionally?&quot;, or &quot;Does your entire diet every day consist of candy <br/>\n(anesthesia for the mind and spirit)? I see the obsession today with video <br/>\ngames as just another drug. I like a glass of wine, but wouldn&#39;t drink 5 <br/>\nbottles in the name of fun.  All things in moderation....<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry<br/>\nLife is too short.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: keyboarding","postDate":"1025280081","msgId":38706,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDYyODA4NTc0OC4wMjhhNDU3MEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PGFmaHFtMSsybHUxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDYyLjIxYzQ1MGVkLjJhNGRhNzkxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38700,"nextInTopic":38743,"prevInTime":38705,"nextInTime":38707,"topicId":38653,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
