Everyone is welcome to present a funshop and I will plan low/no cost tourist activities for people to choose from.<br/>\nThe hotel will be right on the beach, so we&#39;ll have miles of sugar white sand and warm water for swimming. Hopefully the dolphins will be present for all of you...they make appearances now and then.<br/>\nI hope some of you will be here, we have quite a few unschooling families living down this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.&quot;<br/>\nAlbert Einstein</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89087,"nextTopicId":89075}}
