I have really considered asking him to <br/>\nread through some messages.   As far as him posting here.. I kind of have to <br/>\nchuckle.. Oh, I KNOW he would do it.. But, if you guys think I am tough to <br/>\ndeal with... he woud be 10 times worse.   He would be VERY aggressive, <br/>\nprobably downright disprectful, argumentative, and plain stubborn.  Heck, <br/>\nhe&#39;s like this with ME, his own mother, Lord knows he aint gonna give <br/>\n&quot;strangers&quot; the benefit of a doubt.  He thinks you guys have brainwashed me <br/>\nand he resents the hell out of it.   I am afraid getting into confrontations <br/>\nhere might even alientate him further from my efforts.   I daresay, if he <br/>\ncame on this group, you would be very surprised to know is just turned 16.. <br/>\nPrecocious does not even begin to describe him.    Now, let me offer a <br/>\n&quot;disclaimer&quot; .. Landon is a GREAT kid..   Gosh, for most parents of teens, <br/>\nthey would be thrilled to have a kid like him.  He does not drink, do drugs, <br/>\nsmoke, .. hes open and honest and  has a job.    Our relationship is ideal <br/>\nand I am so proud of him and I trust him completely.   Our recent conflicts <br/>\nare directly because of the homeschooling/unschooling changes we have made in <br/>\nour lifestyle.   This is another situation ( like the bed time with Dh)  that <br/>\nI cant wait out for months to resolve itself.  It affects all of us day to <br/>\nday.   He and I DO have private conversations.. but he still cops his <br/>\nattitude and lets his opinions be known when he sees something going on that <br/>\nhe feels should be handled differently.  What he says REALLY affects Anna <br/>\nbecause she idolizes him as a big brother and he has a lot of influence over <br/>\nher.  The boys, they just resent him and avoid him because he hurts thier <br/>\nfeelings.    Again, another tough quandry<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57123,"nextTopicId":57118}}
