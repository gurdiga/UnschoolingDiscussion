They couldn&#39;t have done it if<br/>\nthe kids didn&#39;t help in some way.  So depending on how<br/>\nold your kids are (mine are still quite young) find<br/>\nout what they would like to do to help.  Some things<br/>\nthat come to mind for me is:  read about<br/>\npermaculture/natural gardening as a family, ask the<br/>\nkids for help, make a list of the things to do in a<br/>\ngarden then everyone helps do what they would most<br/>\nenjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook for permaculture groups  in your area or start<br/>\none and let them come over to your place and get lots<br/>\nof hands on experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps,<br/>\nSamantha<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

We are also aiming<br/>\ntowards a permaculture type of environment for our small block of land.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, because it was raining,  I spent some time trying to work out what and<br/>\nhow many activities we could manage, money- and time-wise this year (our school<br/>\nyear goes from February to December, and so, of course, do many of the kids&#39;<br/>\nactivities such as music lessons, gym etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rain stopped, so I raced out to the garden to do some weeding,  plant out<br/>\nsome more seedlings, and sow some more seeds. Then, having ignored me all day,<br/>\nsuddenly people needed me :-(  This is not the first time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if unschooling is about allowing kids to learn what, when and how they want,<br/>\nand our job is that of a facilitator, how do you all cope with the needs of the<br/>\ngarden to be dealt with at the right time - I can&#39;t control the weather - and<br/>\nthe kids needs? At the moment I feel like sending them to the great baby sitting<br/>\nservice next year so I can get on with developing our land. I am feeling very<br/>\nfrustrated. I have tried to get them involved, and 2 out of 3 showed a little<br/>\ninterest, which has since waned.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have other interests - book making and writing - that I can fit around the<br/>\nkids, but it seems this growing business is less amenable to &#39;fitting&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how do you all deal with this? Help!!!! Any suggestions? Or sympathy even<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14758,"nextTopicId":14763}}
