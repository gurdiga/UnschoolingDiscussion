We&#39;ve been wanting to go for years, but now we&#39;re much more inspired and focused!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI happen to be a huge history and culture buff and food is the way I tend to explore these things. As I was preparing the Chinese food tonight (to celebrate the Chinese New Year that begins tomorrow) Sierra  asked &quot;is this medieval food again?&quot;:) <br/>\nWe have paper lanterns hanging around the dining area that the kids made today, wrappers laying around from all that durn rice candy they ate and aching bellies full of fried rice, rice noodles and tofu (except for Trevor who decided it all tasted icky and ate scrambled eggs instead!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe in waiting until a child gets older or becomes an adult to fully explore their interests, believe me! But sometimes there is nothing like the real life experience of actually BEING somewhere totally different than the U.S.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.&quot;<br/>\nAlbert Einstein</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Joel Hawthorne","from":"Joel Hawthorne &lt;jhawthorne@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"6SReHbItuJXhV8aaBGknsInUHHqyGgCRBFcfqMP1QkTwX-se-toN6b35bW1rZ5k-b_FFEG_j_43ThZ3YI1_Jszr7XEg5mldIk_R5","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: unit studies","postDate":"942317660","msgId":4425,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yOTEuNDQyNS45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4311,"nextInTopic":89769,"prevInTime":4424,"nextInTime":4426,"topicId":4311,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes.
