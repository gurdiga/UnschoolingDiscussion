BUT...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would probably help you with the therapist and maybe your<br/>\nhusband if you call it &quot;looking for win-win solutions&quot; and &quot;creative<br/>\nproblem solving&quot;.  (Popular American buzzwords.  You may have to<br/>\ntranslate them into your local lingo, but I hope you can get my drift. <br/>\nUse really nice-sounding psychologist speech if you can.  It takes away<br/>\none of the psychologist&#39;s most effective weapons. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s over-simplified and maybe a bit misleading but you could describe<br/>\nTCS as looking for a solution that meets everyone&#39;s needs.  [1]  Then,<br/>\nif such a solution can&#39;t be found, a **compromise** would be reached. <br/>\n(Flatter the therapist a little by sounding like you are incorporating<br/>\nher ideas.)  I would downplay the idea that compromise would almost<br/>\nnever be required.  I don&#39;t think she&#39;s likely to believe that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nfootnote [1]  I think this idea, finding a solution that meets all<br/>\nneeds, can be philosophically connected back to what the therapist was<br/>\ntrying to change/fix about your problem solving process with your<br/>\nhusband.  I&#39;m guessing, since you said that things are messed up, the<br/>\ntwo of you **don&#39;t** work together constructively to find mutually<br/>\nsatisfactory solutions to stuff -- right?  Does he not &quot;take you<br/>\nseriously&quot;?  Or do you not take him seriously?  Does he start right off<br/>\nthe bat yelling, or does he aggravate you so that you end up yelling in<br/>\none minute flat?  (Don&#39;t answer my questions, I know that&#39;s personal.) <br/>\nBut you WISH you could successfully work stuff out with him -- right? <br/>\nOr do you just think it would be tons easier to be single?  (Don&#39;t<br/>\nanswer that either!)  I think the therapist, at least somewhat, supports<br/>\nyour desire to have interpersonal differences solved in a respectful<br/>\nway.  I think, like Sandra pointed out, that process may be what the<br/>\ntherapist wants to focus on.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":123062302,"authorName":"Mica","from":"&quot;Mica&quot; &lt;ghal9720@...&gt;","profile":"micaherself","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Non-coercive parenting resources?","postDate":"1033528453","msgId":45039,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTUwMWMyNjljMSRjODhlOWZiMCQzZTg2MzNjYkBoYWxsYW0+","inReplyToHeader":"PGQ1LjFlM2MyNWUyLjJhY2FiN2JhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":44921,"nextInTopic":45061,"prevInTime":45038,"nextInTime":45040,"topicId":44921,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve picked up on non-coercive parenting from TCS list years ago, unschooling discussion lists and gleanings from a multitude of other topic books.

At the end of that session she intended to &quot;consult&quot;<br/>\n&gt; with her colleagues and now I&#39;m wondering what all she wants to consult<br/>\n&gt; on, and I hate the paranoia of wondering if she is checking out whether<br/>\n&gt; and how to interfere with our (boys & I) educational choice!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m feeling vulnerable and uncertain<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>First, I hate to hear you are feeling that way, but I really understand. <br/>\nSecond, I wonder how a therapist can ask you to keep the kids out of the <br/>\nissue of homeschooling, when the kids are the issue!? It sounds like the <br/>\ntherapist is already judging you (although, we don&#39;t have the other two sides <br/>\nof the story) and that isn&#39;t her job. Her job is to help you and your husband <br/>\nlearn to communicate with each other, so you can learn to work through your <br/>\nproblems.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would gather a good list of books and web sites that deal with unschooling <br/>\nand non-coercive parenting and give this to the therapist and your husband at <br/>\nyour next session. I would tell them both that you would be more than willing <br/>\nto discuss their concerns after they have read a few selections from your <br/>\nlist. Because you feel that the discussion would be more productive after <br/>\neveryone is more informed and on the same page with these issues. You should <br/>\nprobably go over the list as well and be able to present your *arguement* in <br/>\na clear, concise manner, without being defensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also try looking into finding a therapist who is open and supportive <br/>\nof attachment, non-corecive parenting and alternative education philosophies. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you guys see her together only, or do you each meet with her seperately <br/>\nand then together? Years ago, when Darin and I were having problems, we saw a <br/>\ntherapist who would meet with us for about 5 minutes or so each, at the <br/>\nbeginning of the session and then we would all go in together. As we learned <br/>\nto air our differences without all the *he said she said* crap, we didn&#39;t <br/>\nmeet separate as much. It was a huge help to be able to articulate what was <br/>\nbothering us without the other sitting there making the typical *noises* <br/>\n(sighs, snorts and groans) and the angry body language (crossed arms, raised <br/>\neyebrows, tapping feet, rolling eyes) And the therapist didn&#39;t comment then, <br/>\nshe would wait till we were together and present the problem in better words, <br/>\nto the other person, than we knew how to use at the time. <br/>\nHope this helps, FWIW.<br/>\nGood Luck! :o)<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44899,"nextTopicId":45153}}
