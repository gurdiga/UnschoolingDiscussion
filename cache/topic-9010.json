You seem to be a sweet-heart.   We all <br/>\nhave our hang-ups.  But it&#39;s unfortunate when people feel they have to <br/>\nimpose their hang-ups on others.  (I&#39;ve been one of those kinds of people, <br/>\ntoo.)   :(  :)   If you could be a light of kindness, gentleness and <br/>\ngraciousness in your neighborhood, I think you&#39;ll make a greater impact.  <br/>\nSometimes speaking our minds isn&#39;t wise.  Understanding where others are <br/>\ncoming from and trying to live peaceably (without making your chest a <br/>\nwelcome mat for everyone to wipe their feet on) is wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour neighbor was probably raised in harshness.  The fruit doesn&#39;t fall far <br/>\nfrom the tree.  So, it&#39;d be nice if she could see an example (like you).  <br/>\nMaybe she&#39;ll wanna break the cycle of violence in her own life one day.  Or, <br/>\nmaybe her kids will learn from your behavior that there is another way to <br/>\nlive.  Who can know?   Meanwhile, your kids are blessed with a Mom who&#39;s <br/>\njust a sweetie.  :)   They have a great advantage growing up with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of smiles............Marcy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Nanci and Thomas Kuykendall&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tn-k4of5@...\">tn-k4of5@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Neighbor Blues<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 8 Jun 2000 18:13:35 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sounds like your neighbor is one twisted sister.

Her &quot;issue&quot; with your<br/>\n&gt;babies tells more about HER than anything. That is tough when you don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;the privacy fence there. I, personally, think she is ill in thought because<br/>\n&gt;2&3 years old and she&#39;s got a problem with it? Like I said, it states a lot<br/>\n&gt;about her. We have a privacy fence on one side and the back of our yard, <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;open side faces nothing but a greenbelt and my Emily, 5yo, STILL loves to<br/>\n&gt;get into her little pool nakie, but really likes to run around in her<br/>\n&gt;panties. I told her only in the back yard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would like to say that I would have told her she was sick and perverted<br/>\n&gt;for thinking anything was wrong with your boys being outside at that age<br/>\n&gt;nudie, but we live in a society full of shame and shaming. Especially for<br/>\n&gt;the naked body, one of the most natural things on our Mother earth However<br/>\n&gt;in this time you have to really think before you say something like that<br/>\n&gt;because you never know how far someone may take something and it&#39;s too bad<br/>\n&gt;to feel that way but one must take care with people like that.

Had a rather unpleasant experience yesterday.  My two toddlers (2<br/>\n&gt;and 3) were splashing around naked in a wading pool in our backyard.  Our<br/>\n&gt;neighbor, who has two girls (7 and 13) came over and complained, saying <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;she did not want her girls to see my boys naked.  We do not yet have <br/>\n&gt;privacy<br/>\n&gt;fencing up in back, just chain fencing. I thought it was particularly <br/>\n&gt;silly,<br/>\n&gt;given that my babes are not even toilet trained yet, and are still in<br/>\n&gt;diapers.  In the interests of neighborhood peace, I aquiesced to putting<br/>\n&gt;shorts on them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;However, this is the same neighbor who screams/shouts obscenities at her<br/>\n&gt;daughters in the yard (front and back) at the top of her lungs all the <br/>\n&gt;time.<br/>\n&gt;She also pulls their hair and strikes them, that I have seen, as well as<br/>\n&gt;calling them stupid, fat, etc.  Not the type of things I really want my<br/>\n&gt;toddlers to see or hear.  Especially since the 7 year old (and often her 8<br/>\n&gt;yr old cousin) comes over frequently to play in our house and yard and my 3<br/>\n&gt;year old is quite fond of her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Her demand for swim trunks on my babies gave me the urge to march over <br/>\n&gt;there<br/>\n&gt;and ask her to please refrain from screaming obscenities and abusing her<br/>\n&gt;children where mine could hear and see it.  Of course I didn&#39;t, as that<br/>\n&gt;would be petty and childish.  But I just felt the need to vent and share <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;event with all of you.  It upset me a bit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Nanci K.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Show off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\n&gt;Sign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;************************************************************************<br/>\n&gt;You&#39;re just seconds away from playing the web&#39;s FREE Million Dollar slot<br/>\n&gt;machine.

The whole while not meeting my gaze and clearly nervous.  So I took her chin gently and I looked into her eyes and said, &quot;In this house, we don&#39;t hit.&quot;  Then I smiled and gave her a bit of a hug and left the kids to play.

Her &quot;issue&quot; with your<br/>\n&gt; babies tells more about HER than anything. That is tough when you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; the privacy fence there. I, personally, think she is ill in thought<br/>\nbecause<br/>\n&gt; 2&3 years old and she&#39;s got a problem with it? Like I said, it states a<br/>\nlot<br/>\n&gt; about her. We have a privacy fence on one side and the back of our yard,<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; open side faces nothing but a greenbelt and my Emily, 5yo, STILL loves to<br/>\n&gt; get into her little pool nakie, but really likes to run around in her<br/>\n&gt; panties.

Had a rather unpleasant experience yesterday.  My two toddlers (2<br/>\n&gt; and 3) were splashing around naked in a wading pool in our backyard.  Our<br/>\n&gt; neighbor, who has two girls (7 and 13) came over and complained, saying<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; she did not want her girls to see my boys naked.  We do not yet have<br/>\nprivacy<br/>\n&gt; fencing up in back, just chain fencing. I thought it was particularly<br/>\nsilly,<br/>\n&gt; given that my babes are not even toilet trained yet, and are still in<br/>\n&gt; diapers.  In the interests of neighborhood peace, I aquiesced to putting<br/>\n&gt; shorts on them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, this is the same neighbor who screams/shouts obscenities at her<br/>\n&gt; daughters in the yard (front and back) at the top of her lungs all the<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n&gt; She also pulls their hair and strikes them, that I have seen, as well as<br/>\n&gt; calling them stupid, fat, etc.  Not the type of things I really want my<br/>\n&gt; toddlers to see or hear.  Especially since the 7 year old (and often her 8<br/>\n&gt; yr old cousin) comes over frequently to play in our house and yard and my<br/>\n3<br/>\n&gt; year old is quite fond of her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Her demand for swim trunks on my babies gave me the urge to march over<br/>\nthere<br/>\n&gt; and ask her to please refrain from screaming obscenities and abusing her<br/>\n&gt; children where mine could hear and see it.  Of course I didn&#39;t, as that<br/>\n&gt; would be petty and childish.  But I just felt the need to vent and share<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; event with all of you.
