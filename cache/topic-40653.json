It&#39;s been kind of baffling to me that<br/>\npeople would want to discuss something without being able to discuss the<br/>\nfacts and talk with the people involved. It just seems to me if people<br/>\nreally were interested in the case they&#39;d *want* to go to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MAhomeschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MAhomeschoolers/</a> to find out what Kim Bryant<br/>\nherself had to say. And what the arguments for and against their position<br/>\nwere. (That list started late in April 2001. For discussion before that<br/>\nyou&#39;ll need to go to: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/masshomelearningassoc/)\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/masshomelearningassoc/)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDoing it here we can&#39;t do more than guess and speculate. All we could do is<br/>\ncreate something that *we want* the case to have been about and *want* the<br/>\nBryants to have been fighting for and *want* the Bryants themselves to have<br/>\nbeen. Heroes. We want heroes to rally behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I can see how it&#39;s equally baffling to others that the homeschoolers of<br/>\nMA have seemingly rejected a hero right here in our very midst.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to have been there. Every time I tuned into the list Kim was trying<br/>\nto explain her interpretation of the state constitution and why she was<br/>\nright and the state was wrong. There was no hint of &quot;I know you guys don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand or agree with our tactics, but we think fighting this particular<br/>\nbattle will help all homeschoolers.&quot; Nope. Just her interpretation of the<br/>\nconstitution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bryants weren&#39;t Minute Men. The Minute Men were organized groups in a<br/>\ntown who got together to fight the enemy they all agreed was the enemy. The<br/>\nBryants were off on their own firing their muskets at targets of their own<br/>\nchoosing. The difference is neither good nor bad, better nor worse. It&#39;s<br/>\njust different.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bryants appeared to be engaged in a *personal* battle with the state. As<br/>\na *side effect* it could have benefited other homeschoolers. But the battle<br/>\nappeared to be *personal*. Which *suggested* that whether it benefited other<br/>\nhomeschoolers was not was not their primary goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it was a false appearance. Maybe the Bryants were so deeply into the<br/>\ncourt battle that they couldn&#39;t see the forest for the trees. But we can&#39;t<br/>\njudge by other than what we&#39;re given to see. And all we were given was a<br/>\ntiny view of the trees the Bryants were most concerned about and no hint<br/>\nthat they cared about the forest at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want it to appear I&#39;m demonizing the Bryants. I don&#39;t think they<br/>\nshould have fought a different battle than they did or in a different way<br/>\nthan they did it. They fought a battle they believed in. That&#39;s what they<br/>\nshould have done! I won&#39;t judge them for what they did because I don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand what or why they did it. But I won&#39;t participate in pretending<br/>\nthey were fighting some battle other than what it appeared they were<br/>\nfighting just because people want heroes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to help the Bryants you can go to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.educationalfreedom.com/pages/bryant.html\">http://www.educationalfreedom.com/pages/bryant.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also Justice for Families (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.justiceforfamilies.com/)\">http://www.justiceforfamilies.com/)</a> who<br/>\nare fighting abuse by DSS. They were involved with the Bryants during the<br/>\ncourt battles. It started in MA so the above links to the MA site. But<br/>\nothers are opening up chapters across the US and those are listed at the<br/>\nbottom of: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.justiceforfamilies.com/Chapters.htm\">http://www.justiceforfamilies.com/Chapters.htm</a> (There&#39;s a Florida<br/>\nchapter too!)

Go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org\">http://www.nhen.org</a> for a list<br/>\nof state homeschooling groups. You may have to dig some. It may be your<br/>\nstate group isn&#39;t interested in some advocacy going on so is ignoring it.<br/>\nYou&#39;ll need to ask.

I think you<br/>\nspeak for many people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Declaration of Independence tells me that when our government creates<br/>\nunnecessary burdens for us, it is not just our right, but our &quot;Duty&quot; to<br/>\nchange it.  Americans are born with rights. Our rights are not bestowed by<br/>\ngovernments, they are ours by birth. And governments, in this country, are<br/>\ncreated for the purpose of protecting those rights, not to trample them, as<br/>\nMA does to all homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Declaration says: &quot;...whenever any form of government becomes<br/>\ndestructive of these Ends [our unalienable rights to life, liberty and the<br/>\npursuit of happiness], it is the Right of the people to alter or to abolish<br/>\nit, and to institute new government...&quot; Later on, it says...it is their<br/>\nright, their Duty, to throw off such governments that reduce our rights<br/>\nunder despotism. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bryants, as I see it, are trying to answer that call, to begin to change<br/>\nthings for the better, even though they know how simple (but dishonest) it<br/>\nwould be to comply with the bad law. Americans put up with bad government<br/>\nfor a long time, but finally, they had had enough. What say we..? When will<br/>\nwe have had enough of bad laws, of being treated like naughty unruly<br/>\nignorant children by people who usually don&#39;t know their butt from a<br/>\nbicycle, but have bad law behind them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeWes does what most people do, but at the risk/cost of violating his/her<br/>\nown convictions of right and wrong, honesty and dishonesty. Is it OK for<br/>\nhomeschoolers to be expected to lie to the state in order to be &quot;approved&quot;<br/>\nby a clerk? We can&#39;t blame DeWes or anyone else, but more importantly, we<br/>\nshould be ashamed of talking about the Bryants as though they are fools for<br/>\nnot following simple, but stupid and coercive and despotic rules. They are<br/>\nbeing punished for honestly making their convictions, and their<br/>\nhomeschooling practice known -- even up for ridicule -- by the courts. But<br/>\nthat shows the court&#39;s lack of enlightenment, not theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bryants are heroes. We need thousands of Bryant families. Unfortunately<br/>\nthere are few such people, but they are the minutemen of homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do we have, if not a few principles? If we stand for nothing, we fall<br/>\nfor anything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that we all owe the Bryants a huge debt of gratitude (and<br/>\nfinancial help with legal fees if we can afford to share) for being willing<br/>\nand courageous enough to try to make things better for us all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, there&#39;s a candidate for Governor of Massachusetts, Carla Howell. Like<br/>\nme, she&#39;s a libertarian and, as you know, the Libertarian Party is 100% in<br/>\nfavor of Homeschooling. I consider myself a friend of hers (I was the LP<br/>\ncandidate for Gov of CT in &#39;98) and I know that she will work to eliminate<br/>\nany and all restrictions to homeschooling freedoms.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\n&quot;If tolerance is your main virtue, you have no others.&quot;  -- Chesterton</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40704,"nextTopicId":40710}}
