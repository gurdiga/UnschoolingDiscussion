That was an old thread which, if I recall, Cindy just ask us not to re-surface again. But to respond to it since you did, you are referring to Bridget and her son. She has stated that he has a medical condition which warrants a strict outline of his day. She has never said she is unschooling him... she&#39;s indicated that to the list repeatedly.  It *was* pointed out to Bridget (by me) that posting her experiences with Wyndham leads one to believe she&#39;s citing unschooling examples and that is incorrect imo.  She has since posted less about her experiences with him and when she does, she makes it *very* clear that he is an exception to the norm and he is *not* unschooled!<br/>\nGive it a rest, please.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSarah Carothers, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a> on 1/27/2002<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1771","postDate":"1012154122","msgId":31615,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDQwMWMxYTc1YiRkOGZiNjBhMCQ0OWE2YjFkOEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMTIwNjk4ODYuMTI1NS41ODY3NS5tMTBAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31636,"prevInTime":31614,"nextInTime":31616,"topicId":31615,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Unschooling means trusting children to make choices, to learn.
