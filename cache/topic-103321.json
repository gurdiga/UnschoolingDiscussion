I <br/>\nchecked out a book from the library two years or so ago, the title of <br/>\nwhich i don&#39;t remember, but it explained dyslexic brains as being <br/>\nextraordinary, not flawed. The ability to see things in all their <br/>\nthree dimensions is a trait that should be envied. When I explained <br/>\ndyslexia to katie, she was completely accepting of it, and even a <br/>\nlittle bit relieved &quot;Oh! THAT&#39;S why I&#39;m not reading yet.&quot; I consider <br/>\nit sort of like a person maybe with a port wine birthmark, <br/>\nthinking &quot;What is WRONG with me!?&quot; and someone telling her it&#39;s a <br/>\nskin mark that she was born with, nothing dangerous. That&#39;s not the <br/>\nbest analogy, but I can&#39;t think of a better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as for her accepting it...well, if she was in school, and <br/>\nofficially diagnosed with dyslexia, she would have been made to know <br/>\nfor sure that she was flawed because of it, and more likely NEVER to <br/>\naccept it. Better to accept it and learn everything you can about <br/>\nboth the strengths and the weaknesses inherent with a spatially <br/>\noriented brain, than to be told &quot;because you can&#39;t decipher two <br/>\ndimensional figures with your three dimension-prone brain, you lose.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever else we&#39;ve done, we haven&#39;t placed a negative connotation <br/>\nupon the term dyslexic.

We are <br/>\nwithin walking distance of the local community non-profit theatre, <br/>\nwhere my 17 year old daughter spends pretty much every evening. She <br/>\nlanded the part of Narissa in their upcoming production of Merchant <br/>\nof Venice. Narissa is the lady-in-waiting for Portia: the main female <br/>\ncharacter. She&#39;s also assistant stage manager for the current <br/>\nproduction of Forever Plaid, and will be the assistant director for <br/>\nthe upcoming musical The King and I. She&#39;s been babysitting for my <br/>\nsister since we got here, but is now putting in applications for a <br/>\npart time job, in order to afford her acting and voice lessons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe younger kids are absorbed in TV, gameboy, a computer game called <br/>\nRune Quest, Star Wars, big cats, some Playstation, snow play, dog <br/>\ncare, ( for which my youngest hires herself out in the neighborhood <br/>\nand makes a buck here and there) <br/>\n<br/>\nMiddle child just turned 12 and is Mr. Mellow, concerned mostly with <br/>\nmastering the latest computer game and making sure to be in front of <br/>\nthe TV when Teen Titans comes on. And running. <br/>\n<br/>\nYoungest child turned 10 last summer, and is still not reading, good <br/>\nLORD. But she approached a woman in the neighborhood who specializes <br/>\nin dyslexia at the local school, and we&#39;re going to get set up with <br/>\nan assessment. This is something my youngest has taken on herself, <br/>\ncompletely. I don&#39;t necessarily want to get involved w/the public <br/>\nsystem, but if it&#39;s what she thinks will help her get a handle on <br/>\nreading, then we&#39;re going to do it. Reading aside, she&#39;s having no <br/>\ntrouble with expressing herself and has a fantastic vocabulary, and <br/>\nis superb at spatial things. She&#39;s also got a way with numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am taking piano lessons at the advanced level, pushing towards the <br/>\nspring Flying Fingers Festival and loving every minute of it, even <br/>\nthe scales in minor and minor natural keys. *shudder* The piano <br/>\nstudio is also within walking distance. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne big reason I dropped in was to give a jolt to our unschooling. To <br/>\nremind myself that it&#39;s a GOOD thing. and it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nNice &quot;seeing&quot; youse.
