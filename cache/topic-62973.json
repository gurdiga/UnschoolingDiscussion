The two boys had the<br/>\nopen, joyous, friendly confidence of kittens who do not expect to get hurt,<br/>\nthey had an innocently natural, non-boastful sense of their own value and as<br/>\ninnocent a trust in any stranger&#39;s ability to recognize it, they had the<br/>\neager curiousity that would venture anywhere with the certainty that life<br/>\nheld nothing unworthy of or closed to discovery, and they looked as if,<br/>\nshould they encounter malevolence, they would reject it contemptuously, not<br/>\nas dangerous, but as stupid, they would not accept it in bruised resignation<br/>\nas the law of existence.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for posting this. I remember seeing Ayn Rand on the Donohue show when<br/>\nI was a young teenager and she made a huge impression on me  - not<br/>\nnecessarily positive or negative, but I remember thinking that she was<br/>\nutterly unlike any human that I knew. So I read this book sometime right<br/>\nafter that, and I also have a vague recollection of this section of the<br/>\nbook.  I didn&#39;t feel the book was terribly depressing either, I think it<br/>\ngave voice to some things I was mulling over at that moment in my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for sharing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) My underwater swimming dolphin<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99)   The girl who makes everyone laugh<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.exmsft.com/~robinc/\">http://www.exmsft.com/~robinc/</a>  Flying Clevenger Family Webpage</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62970,"nextTopicId":62910}}
