I have one daughter, 15 1/5, who has been learning at home since I pulled her out of PS after second grade.   At that point she hated school and was sure she was  a failure  (at the ripe old age of 8).   She is still, to this day, somewhat math-phobic, but otherwise has a great attitude about her education as long as I don&#39;t put a textbook in front of her.   *smile*<br/>\n<br/>\nMarianne<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Deb <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, July 06, 2002 4:39 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2146<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ahh, thank you Marianne.
