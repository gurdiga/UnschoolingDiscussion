This hasn&#39;t <br/>\nbeen a problem, as our kids have had chickens and a treehouse, and <br/>\nI&#39;ve always had plenty of books, craft books and supplies; we have <br/>\nbikes, good places to walk (one of my passions is Amateur Naturalist-<br/>\ning...LOL)...so our outside activities have centered around stuff we <br/>\ncan do as a family right here in our valley...and then my oldest <br/>\nbecame a teenager, and has been more involved in the nearest city for <br/>\nthree years, as a library volunteer. This has meant at times, twice a <br/>\nweek drives to the city... hour long drives that put 100 mi round <br/>\ntrip on our vehicles. When she signed up for a drama workshop at <br/>\nIdaho State, it was an EVERY DAY drive, for five days in a row. She <br/>\nis also in the drama class at a high school that is 30 minutes <br/>\ndistant...every day, mon-fri, 60 miles on the van! ack...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so, partly because of the activity level that she is choosing, <br/>\nand partly because our two younger ones are beginning to come into <br/>\nthat age (at 9 and nearly 11...) but mostly because we need to be <br/>\nnear an economic center for the jobs available...we are moving closer <br/>\nto a large city, just so that we do have activities closer by.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that never did catch our attention, but is lots of fun for <br/>\nmany families (and has POTENTIAL!!!) is 4-H...are you in an area <br/>\nwhere you can get involved in 4-H? I have a friend whose boy has been <br/>\nall over the nation, including to DC more than once, due to his 4-H <br/>\ninvolvement, and is now attending college in Pharmacology on a full <br/>\nride academic scholarship...homeschooled his whole life, with 4-H <br/>\nbeing the one consistent factor in his and his sisters&#39; educations...<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway, if you are in the middle of nowhere, sounds like the country, <br/>\nor small town...4-H would be my biggest recommendation, if it&#39;s <br/>\nsomething your family likes. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe drove many miles getting our older girl to her activities, and now <br/>\nwe are moving closer to those activities...but 4-H IS activities. We <br/>\njust never did get into it. And we have to move anyway, but we might <br/>\nhave moved for the sake of closer activities...I&#39;m looking forward to <br/>\nit big time.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, heidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Gary & Lisa Williams <br/>\n&lt;glmnw@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi Joyce~<br/>\n&gt; Yes, I see you point.
