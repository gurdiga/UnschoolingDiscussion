It&#39;s all in how it gets phrased <br/>\nI guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n I agree with Lynda&#39;s assesment. . . .if someone is hitting or spanking a <br/>\nchild outside of the home, there are some serious issues there. I was <br/>\nthinking, how might it empower a young person to see another adult stand up <br/>\nto that parent and tell them it is not okay to hit another living being . . . <br/>\nhow might that young person&#39;s life be changed by a simple statement like that <br/>\n. . . how might that life turn out very differently if their feelings were <br/>\naffirmed by someone. I can say the risk in getting involved would be well <br/>\nworth it if it gave some hope to a child.  I know that each has chosen their <br/>\nown particular path and when I come upon a situation like this, I have a <br/>\nchoice as well. My choice is to speak aloud as the spirit moves me to. It&#39;s <br/>\nlike throwing a pebble into a pond . . .the ripple effect, touching people&#39;s <br/>\nlives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as judgment goes, we all judge others. We judge other parents <br/>\ncontinually by the choices we make regarding them. We judge ourselves as well <br/>\n(yes, I do see the irony in this statement considering my sig line) on a <br/>\nmyriad of issues. When I say something to another person about their spanking <br/>\na child, I am not  saying I judge that person to be bad or immoral or <br/>\nwhatever. I do believe I am saying that the action of striking another being <br/>\nis hurtful, painful emotionally and physically, and extremely damaging to a <br/>\nyoung person. To me it is no different than a husband stirking his wife when <br/>\nshe is doing something he thinks is wrong. . . can you imagine getting your <br/>\nbutt or hand slapped in public by your husband because you were too noisy, or <br/>\nneeded to pee AGAIN, or spilled something, or etc. etc etc. There is no <br/>\njustification for doing it . . . of course, people make mistakes, but if you <br/>\nare seeing it in public, it is a mistake that is common, and someone needs to <br/>\nsay so and affirm for that young person. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to how it relates to unschooling, it a young person is spanked/hit and <br/>\nfears their parents, it follows (to me) that there is very little free choice <br/>\nin that young person&#39;s life. Their choices are motivated by fear and doing <br/>\nthe &quot;right&quot; thing, not by intrinsic motivation, hence unschooling would not <br/>\nbe able to trule occur.<br/>\n<br/>\nliving in abundance<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot judge my own path and SELF, having the knowledge that I have chosen <br/>\nto come here to experience these specific issues and grow, learn, and <br/>\nRemember Who I Am.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86201113,"authorName":"Donna B","from":"&quot;Donna B&quot; &lt;Donnabzy@...&gt;","profile":"donnabzy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: good and bad children","postDate":"1009138543","msgId":30182,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWMwMWMxOGJlZSQ5YTNkYzAyMCRmNWFhMWMzZkBkb25uYWJpcm9jemt5Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGEwNGxrYittcW52QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDA3NzAxYzE4YmU5JDYyZDJhZjYwJDljNWRkMWQxQGppZGEzNT4="},"prevInTopic":30181,"nextInTopic":30183,"prevInTime":30181,"nextInTime":30183,"topicId":30119,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think some women lose it in public more easily because at home, they don t have to worry so much about what their kids are doing -- as opposed to in public,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-422394126\">I think some women lose it in public more easily because at home, they don&#39;t have to worry so much about what their kids are doing -- as opposed to in public, where they have to maintain their children at usually much more of a restricted level. Just a thought, but I think part of the reason is that the mother (or father) gets nervous about her child crying, making a mess, being too noisy, whatever, and they lose it while trying to restrain the child to prevent the negative reactions of others. Maybe if more people kept their unwanted comments to themselves, parents would worry less about having to keep their kids in line to the point of losing it  ;)  <br/>\n<br/>\nDonna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Lynda <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, December 23, 2001 10:01 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: good and bad children<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m always a little concerned with moms who &quot;loose it&quot; in public places.

The great-grandmother watched the child for a few minutes while his mother got something from the store next door. She SCREAMED at this kid, in this little salon, &quot;SIT DOWN, STAY THERE, NOW, NOW, ....etc&quot; with this dog-like growl in her voice. I turned to look, while trying to get my own baby to stay calm (he doesn&#39;t like yelling, sometimes he cries) and a lady at the cashier counter turned and started to comment. But, the great-grandmother was yelling so loud, she heard nothing. Then, mom came in, the kid was fine, and no one acted like anything had happened. The gg finally said &quot;he&#39;s a handful!&quot; or something like that (it wasn&#39;t as nice as saying &#39;handful&#39; and the mom says oh yes, he is, which amazed me in itself..he was a typical 2 yo, imho) and then walked away to get her haircut. She came up to me about 15 mins later telling me how well-behaved my 6 yod was and how pretty, etc. She was so sweet, it was hard to remember she&#39;d been screeching not long before. Sort of sad, because she was obviously of the old school temperament of &#39;children should be still and quiet,&#39; which my dd was -- she was getting her haircut, but she should see her other times LOL  <br/>\n<br/>\nD<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Lynda <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, December 20, 2001 9:33 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] good and bad children<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have and the kidlets head for the hills &lt;g&gt;  They know sh*ts gonna hit the<br/>\n  fan!

That&#39;s <br/>\nwhy I don&#39;t hit my children. I moved quickly to stop my daughter from <br/>\neating something that was on the floor. Perhaps I could&#39;ve made a different <br/>\nchoice. Thank you for caring so much about children.&quot; I&#39;m really paranoid <br/>\nabout e-coli (what my son Kadin died from), so I would have also added, &quot;My <br/>\nson died from e-coli, so I am really concerned about things on floors in <br/>\npublic places.&quot; (That shuts a lot of people up!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have to ask though - because hitting children is legal, we shouldn&#39;t <br/>\nspeak up about someone hitting their child? I have to say I have never <br/>\nspoken directly to anyone who is hitting their child in public. Every time <br/>\nit happens though (often, unfortunately), I turn to Alexandria and say, &quot;I <br/>\nam so sorry you had to see that child get hit. Children are *not* for <br/>\n*hitting* - they are for nurturing, loving, cherishing, protecting, and <br/>\nlearning patience from.&quot; Now, I am not talking about getting *hit* (aka <br/>\nspanked - whatever), not getting a hand away from the mouth quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI speak up about all sorts of things that are *legal* - SIN feeding, <br/>\ncutting penises, c/sections (non-medical medical births for that matter)...<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder *when* hitting children will become illegal. Geez - it&#39;s illegal <br/>\nfor one legal adult to hit another legal adult. I have never been able to <br/>\nfigure out why it&#39;s legal to hit a child. And I do *not* advocate for CPS <br/>\nin any manner what-so-ever; I hate that gov&#39;t. entity that steals children.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Paula</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"One Six Year Old&#39;s Reading List","postDate":"1008958419","msgId":30160,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAxMTIyMTEwMTI1MS4wMDllYTg0MEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDExMjIwLjIyMDcxOC4tMzYxMzIxLjAuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":30152,"nextInTopic":30166,"prevInTime":30159,"nextInTime":30161,"topicId":30119,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Requests for interesting books for kids to read or have read to them often come up on list.

When I refused to go over <br/>\nthere for years after, I was being called unreasonable for not letting <br/>\nthe incident go. <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel me and my son were owned an apolgy.
