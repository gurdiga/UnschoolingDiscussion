I think was is even more frustrating for me is <br/>\nthat he seems to &quot;get&quot; so many things, that I wonder why he struggles with <br/>\nwriting sometimes.  I am almost convinced that there is a different picture <br/>\nin his head than what comes out on the paper.  He writes backwards almost <br/>\nalways and I thought maybe it had something to do with being left handed.  <br/>\nSome of my relatives are suggesting that maybe he is dyslexic, but I thought <br/>\nit was too early to tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said in my earlier post, it is not as if his meltdowns occur very <br/>\noften, but once in a while it gets to both of us.  Having some feedback on <br/>\nthe topic has been helpful.

First, I just wanted to say that <br/>\nevery year<br/>\ngets better! He&#39;s now nine and his meltdowns are much less intense or very <br/>\nfleeting.<br/>\nLast night I asked him if he could explain what was going on for him. He said<br/>\nbasically exactly what you suspected, that what he pictured in his mind was <br/>\nnot <br/>\nat all what he ended up with. Sometimes when we, or his teacher tried to help<br/>\nit would upset him even more because he said it wasn&#39;t his work or his idea <br/>\nand didn&#39;t count. My son was slow to learn to read, reversed letters and <br/>\nnumbers<br/>\n(still does - but better), and had trouble remembering where to place letters.<br/>\nFor him, I wonder if this had something to do with why what was in his head<br/>\nwasn&#39;t what came out on paper even in his drawings. I really don&#39;t know how <br/>\nmuch<br/>\nis his temperment and how much is visual caused  frustration. Anyways, I <br/>\nreally just wanted to say, have hope because it gets easier. Also, he&#39;s too <br/>\nyoung <br/>\nto even know if he shows any dyslexic/dysgraphic tendencies but if he does in <br/>\nthe future , there is a writing program I just started. It&#39;s called <br/>\nHandwriting Without Tears and you could use it as a reference when he&#39;s ready <br/>\n(www.hwtears.com).<br/>\nHope it helps,<br/>\nDana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Broadcolea@aol.com","from":"Broadcolea@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"JOlXGi2L_Y9qbOcvt83FFtwn9bhc8KgHOxVQmEn1oABlO7OrqHGlDlBmVqyV8LYqmYc5VEqcbClz","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Fwd: frustrated child","postDate":"972160780","msgId":13724,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhmLjIxZTM3YzMuMjcyMzU5MGNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13771,"prevInTime":13723,"nextInTime":13725,"topicId":13724,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just started unschooling my five year old son a couple of months ago.
