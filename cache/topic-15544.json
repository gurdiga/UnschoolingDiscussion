Or rollerskates/blades?<br/>\nScooters? These are things that are good activities families can enjoy<br/>\ntogether. They can also be great alternatives to energy-consumptive<br/>\ntransportation. I&#39;m not a huge fan of organized sports, especially for<br/>\nyoung kids. We try to provide an active lifestyle in our family instead,<br/>\nand engage in activities that are fun and physically challenging.<br/>\nBoth my DH and I do amateur athletics (DH ran a marathon a couple years<br/>\nback, I do triathlons and Master&#39;s swimming, we both skydive) I think it&#39;s<br/>\ngreat for kids to see their parents engaging in active pursuits, whether<br/>\ncompetitively or non-competitively. My son and I had a great discussion one<br/>\nday on the theme of &quot;Why do you do races mom if you&#39;re not going to win?&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhysically active things we do:<br/>\n<br/>\nBicycling: We do every day as our transportation. I&#39;m about to bump my son<br/>\nout of the trailer and onto a kid&#39;s tandem attachment to my bicycle. He&#39;s<br/>\nexcited about becoming &quot;the stoker&quot;. We also take the kids small bikes down<br/>\nto the bike path or have them ride around the garage/driveway<br/>\nRollerskating: Our local rink has a homeschool hour once a week - you might<br/>\ncall your rink and ask if they have something similar, or try to start one.<br/>\nIn the summer, rollerblading on bike paths or sidewalks can be fun<br/>\nSwimming: Many pools now have waterslides or wavepools that can be really<br/>\nfun for all ages<br/>\nPlaying at the park/playground, especially with other kids where they make<br/>\nup games and run around<br/>\nOutdoor games like hopskotch, games with big rubber balls, basketball,<br/>\ncroquet<br/>\nWalking - as exercise or transportation. If we have an errand that&#39;s 1/2<br/>\nmile or less, we usually try to walk<br/>\nHiking on local trails<br/>\nInnertubing/sledding on snow in the winter<br/>\nSkiing/snowboarding/cross-country skiing<br/>\nGo to the river/lake/pond and build a dam out of rocks or just<br/>\nskip/collect/throw rocks<br/>\nBackpacking - even if you only hike in a mile or so, it&#39;s great fun for kids<br/>\nto camp in the outdoors!<br/>\nGardening - this can be great exercise, especially the big stuff like<br/>\nweeding, raking leaves, hoeing, shoveling<br/>\nHorseback riding<br/>\nDancing/folk dancing<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some ideas!!<br/>\n<br/>\n Blue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;I want to grow up to be a nun, because I love to<br/>\nsing&quot; (can you tell we just watched the &quot;Sound of Music&quot;??)<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) &quot;More get doggies happy be!&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bonnie Painter","from":"&quot;Bonnie Painter&quot; &lt;bonniepainter@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"lM1hUAioP1NS9bz6IW7i-SntH2J15xABfonVIEqPnklRpajpD9Ags-79gG21pslL-dGRL-KUTMFYYGP7-5hBjz__dAtg9DeEIdlhZqY7kagYE2g","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom]makin $$","postDate":"980987974","msgId":15645,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY4NWtvcFViOTVLSmJHQlNOZkcwMDAwMTVmM0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":15643,"nextInTopic":15656,"prevInTime":15644,"nextInTime":15646,"topicId":15544,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Another suggestion, which is what I have been doing since the summer, is to work at night.

We live in snowy South<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dakota (just got 20 inches today).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.  What ties us all together as unschoolers?  What is the notivation<br/>\n&gt;behind<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it all for everyone?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My motivation for unschooling is simply that it continues to respect<br/>\n&gt;Accalia<br/>\n&gt; &gt; individuality as she grows. That&#39;s why I practice attachment parenting <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s what drew me to unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.  What does everyone do for discipline when it&#39;s needed?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Truthfully we haven&#39;t had to do much &quot;discipline&quot; around here. Accalia&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; getting past the point where distraction always works, but so far I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;found<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that she responds quite well to me explaining my reasoning and helping <br/>\n&gt;her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to express her feelings of frustration, anger, sadness, etc. I know this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t be as easy as she gets older, but we&#39;ll take it one day at a time<br/>\n&gt;:).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I guess you could say we use gentle and positive discipline. I take a <br/>\n&gt;lot<br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my ideas from The Discipline Book by Sears. I do not use violence in any<br/>\n&gt;way<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - no spanking, no yelling.

Bus or car? Old house or new? Cloth diapers or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disposable? Some choices have a huge impact on the environment; others<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are of negligible importance. To those of us who care about our quality<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of life and what is happening to the earth, this is a vastly important<br/>\n&gt; &gt; issue. In these pages, the Union of Concerned Scientists help inform<br/>\n&gt; &gt; consumers about everyday decisions that significantly affect the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; environment. For example, a few major decisions -- such as the choice of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a house or vehicle -- have such a disproportionately large affect on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; environment that minor environmental infractions shrink by comparison.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This book identifies the 4 Most Significant Consumer-Related<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Environmental Problems, the 7 Most Damaging Spending Categories, 11<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Priority Actions, and 7 Rules for Responsible Consumption. Learn what <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can do to have a truly significant impact on our world from the people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; who are at the forefront of scientific research.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Excerpts:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Consumers are often severely limited in their choices, and the economic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; market is frequently structured in such a way that makes environmentally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sound options unattractive. In other cases, businesses and other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; institutions, rather than individual consumers, are the key<br/>\n&gt; &gt; decision-makers. Government can, and should, help expand the choices,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make responsible behavior appealing, and influence the behavior of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; institutions. Good government policies are needed for action on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; personal lifestyle level to succeed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reviews:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Too many people drive their Land Rovers to the grocery store and think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that &#39;paper or plastic&#39; is a meaningful choice. The Consumer&#39;s Guide To<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Effective Environmental Choices will help you distinguish the crucial<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from the trivial and make choices that are congruent with your values.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Denis Hayes, Chair, Earth Day 2000<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This engaging book gives consumers the information they need to vote <br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their wallets for a better environmental future.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Gary Hirshberg, President, Stonyfield Farm Yogurt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; About The Author:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Michael Brower, Ph.D., is a physicist and expert on energy and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; environmental issues.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Warren Leon, Ph.D., is a deputy director for programs at the Union of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Concerned Scientists.

Unfortunately, no matter what cause is being taken<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up by the people, there are some radicals.  This is true with women&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rights, minority&#39;s rights, government protestors, as well as people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on both sides of abortion.  What constitutes violence is obviously an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; opinion here since photos of tiny feet or movies depicting the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reality of what abortion is have to come from somewhere.  In my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; opinion, a violent act had to take place in order for there to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mutilated body parts.  Do people really want to see these images?  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; personally don&#39;t, but that doesn&#39;t hide the fact that these acts are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; taking place and we call it &quot;abortion&quot; and it&#39;s supposed to be o.k.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since I was responding to a comment made, &quot;...that they can have an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; entirely horrible life of abuse and deprivation is pooh-poohed by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; right-wing Christians in comfortable homes who don&#39;t let their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children associate with the very people whose reproductive rights<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they want to control.&quot;, I&#39;m wondering why it is alright to voice this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; strong and not necessarily accurate view, yet it seems so offensive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to some that my view is pro-life.  Did I place judgement or call &quot;pro-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; choicers&quot; anything but that?  Am I responding to left-wing Atheists?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Did I tell anyone that their opinion is &quot;the lamest bunch of nonsense<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen in a long time.&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    &gt;&gt;Do you think that you have some &quot;God Given&quot; right to shove your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beliefs down our throats, while we have no rights since we don&#39;t all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; prescribe to the rules of your god.  This seems totally unfair and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hypocrital of you.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And rights?  Someone felt that they had the &quot;right&quot; to label and make<br/>\n&gt; &gt; clear their &quot;pro-choice&quot; beliefs, whether I wanted to read it or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not.  But that&#39;s not shoving something down some of our throats?  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do believe that we all have the &quot;right&quot; to our opinion and free-will,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whether you &quot;prescribe to the rules of my God&quot; or not.  Opinion and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; free-will were expressed in the original post regarding abortion, yet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this is not unfair or hypocritical of that person.  I do not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; understand how that can be.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d also like to say that my original intention was not to offend the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; author or the other users on this site.  I see that some of you have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; no problem responding to this with the intention to offend.  I also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know that your beliefs certainly won&#39;t be changed by my posts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, if my husband and I want to have several children, it&#39;s supposed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to be o.k. for everyone to share with us their opinions regarding<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sterilization, birth control and abortion, yet we are not supposed to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; share our belief in procreation?  Again, I do not understand how that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can be.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It does sadden me to see how compassionate people can be toward the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; animals killed daily in our country, but that same compassion does<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not seem to spill over to the humans killed daily in our country.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mommy to Jason (8), Angela (6-1/2), Daniel (3-1/2) and baby due in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; March!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Debbie & K.C.

I agree with<br/>\n&gt;that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; BUT, to ignore the unschooling posts because everyone is in fight mode..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have time for that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m on digest form, to save time.  This digest was nothing but one long<br/>\n&gt; &gt; argument.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t simply delete the &quot;hot&quot; threads, as the message titles don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;reflect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; inside, and they come all together with the good ones.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The ol&#39; Delete button doesn&#39;t work so great under these circumstances, I<br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scroll past all of this....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So I think I will unsub... and that is kind of sad.  I am Christian, but <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; open minded to all beliefs IF that belief calls you to a higher ground.  <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; respect anyone that has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a belief system that changes their behavior for the better.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I just am not seeing that here, I&#39;m seeing people trying to drag each<br/>\n&gt;others<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beliefs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thru the mud.... it&#39;s very sad and against every &quot;religion&quot; or belief<br/>\n&gt;system<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of which I am aware.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We have a LOT in common.  We love our kids and give up a lot to stay <br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and make them the best people they can be.  We share a controversial<br/>\n&gt;method<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we KNOW works... people think we&#39;re nuts..  ;o)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I had hoped that this would be enough to sustain a group.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t mean to preach and run.. I just needed to get it off my chest<br/>\n&gt;instead<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just disappearing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; All the best to everyone!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Laura<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 11<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Tue, 30 Jan 2001 22:07:04 -0500<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Tami Labig-Duquette&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:labigduquette@...\">labigduquette@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Re: Tetris<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I used to hun and whistle the Dr. Mario songs :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I thought they were a cute little didy at the time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tami<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Tetris<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 29 Jan 2001 22:43:15 EST<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;In a message dated 01/29/01 7:54:25 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:diamondair@...\">diamondair@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; There has been a lot of money expended in research to find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;more games that seem to reach the same place in women&#39;s minds as Tetris<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;does.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I like Dr. Mario and Kirby&#39;s Avalanche better because of the color<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;component.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 12<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Tue, 30 Jan 2001 22:10:52 -0800<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Susan &quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seaf@...\">seaf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Re: raising dogs & pro-life<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I just have to respond, and I will probably regret<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it.  I am a practicing Catholic and many of my closet friends, both<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spiritually and neighborly are baptists.  Do I support the radical<br/>\n&gt;pro-life<br/>\n&gt; &gt; movement that burns clinics and kills people?  Of course not, and I&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hard pressed to name one person in my parish of well over a thousand<br/>\n&gt;families<br/>\n&gt; &gt; who would support that kind of violence.  In fact, I&#39;d be hard pressed <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; find a single person in my parish who would consider any other person of<br/>\n&gt;any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; religion &quot;evil.&quot;  In fact, our priests regularly use protestant <br/>\n&gt;Christians<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and members of other faiths as examples of holy life.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; While I certainly know from personal experience that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some people of faith aren&#39;t tolerant, I am quite reluctant to group<br/>\n&gt;everyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; together.   If anyone wants a generalization of Catholicism that works<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for me, it is that we believe that Christ came to redeem the world--and <br/>\n&gt;at<br/>\n&gt;some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; point everyone will be redeemed.  Do I understand how that will work?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Of course not, and I really don&#39;t want to know.  But do I believe that <br/>\n&gt;if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Christ would die to redeem the world-- every single person with every<br/>\n&gt;single<br/>\n&gt; &gt; idiosyncrasy, can I condemn anyone?  I think not.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sometimes people who are part of the radical fringe are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just that--radically unbalanced.  Probably whatever group gave them some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; acceptance would be the beneficiary of their unbalanced sense of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; allegiance.  I love life, and that will cause me to get involved and <br/>\n&gt;help<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyone I can to live a full life--old person, sick person, lonely <br/>\n&gt;person,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; condemned person, unborn person.  Yet, I could never take it upon myself<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; judge and condemn another&#39;s actions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But please, don&#39;t take the old shibboleths and give<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them new life.  I don&#39;t hate anyone, am not a &quot;fundamentalist&quot;, unless <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mean I fundamentally believe God loves us all and we should strive to do<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; same.....Susan---wife of one, mother of three, caretaker of multiple <br/>\n&gt;four<br/>\n&gt;legged<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friends, friend to many...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: 01/30/2001 6:03:08 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; raising dogs   pro-life<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Not right.

Very exciting for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everyone, especially their two daughters.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I just had to comment on the above.  The Pro-Life advocates ARE<br/>\n&gt; &gt; VERY vocal and insistent about their beliefs and surely DO shove them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; down the throats of others.  By your use of &quot;we&quot; I must assume you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are talking about your own family and your personal beliefs, because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the Pro-life movement is absolutely merciless.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pro-Life supporters picket clinics and shout obsceneties at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pregnant women, without knowing anything about their personal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; circumstances or what brought them to the excruciating decision to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; termiante a pregnancy.  The wave signs and banners with slurs and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; condemnations on them, they block entrance to clinics.  The lunatic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fringe of this movement has shot and killed people over<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their &quot;Defense of Life.&quot;  I am baffled as to why you would feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; indignant that others would find some of the behavior of the Pro-Life<br/>\n&gt; &gt; movement and their campaigns to be intrusive and abusive.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am sorry that you have had to endure the shameful behavior of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; others who try to judge your lifestyle.

The wave signs and banners with slurs and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; condemnations on them, they block entrance to clinics.

I am a practicing Catholic and many of my closet friends, both<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritually and neighborly are baptists.

If anyone wants a generalization of Catholicism that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; works<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for me, it is that we believe that Christ came to redeem the world--<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and at some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; point everyone will be redeemed.

But do I believe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Christ would die to redeem the world-- every single person with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; every single<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; idiosyncrasy, can I condemn anyone?  I think not.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes people who are part of the radical fringe are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just that--radically unbalanced.  Probably whatever group gave them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; acceptance would be the beneficiary of their unbalanced sense of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; allegiance.  I love life, and that will cause me to get involved<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and help<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone I can to live a full life--old person, sick person, lonely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; person,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; condemned person, unborn person.  Yet, I could never take it upon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; judge and condemn another&#39;s actions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But please, don&#39;t take the old shibboleths and give<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them new life.  I don&#39;t hate anyone, am not a &quot;fundamentalist&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unless you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mean I fundamentally believe God loves us all and we should strive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to do the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; same.....Susan---wife of one, mother of three, caretaker of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; multiple four legged<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; friends, friend to many...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: Unschooling-dotcom@y...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: 01/30/2001 6:03:08 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; raising dogs   pro-life<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Not right.

All you have to lose is one <br/>\n&gt;or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; two things out of a game and it becomes a lot less fun, if not <br/>\n&gt;impossible,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to play. The pieces get scattered around then the games are no good. <br/>\n&gt;This<br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the downside of a messy house as far as I&#39;m concerned. (We also lose<br/>\n&gt;bigger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things like books, reading glasses, remote controls and toys, but at <br/>\n&gt;least<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they seem to show up eventually.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps other people are better than I am at getting their kids to put<br/>\n&gt;away<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their games when they decide to do something else (&quot;when they are <br/>\n&gt;finished<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with them&quot; would be misleading, since they&#39;re always quitting halfway<br/>\n&gt; &gt; through and running off without a glance backward). You would think that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after having puzzles, games, models and other items with small pieces<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rendered unusable because parts had been lost, that they&#39;d be more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; conscientious, but nooooo. They don&#39;t waste much time regretting that<br/>\n&gt;their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; games and puzzles are ruined, but I&#39;m sorry about it because I think <br/>\n&gt;those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things offer valuable learning experiences (plus they cost money, after<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My boys are 8 and 4.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; By the way, I have been on this list for a long time, and reading<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything, but lurking a lot lately.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Annette<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 22<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Tue, 30 Jan 2001 23:31:19 EST<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:louisaem@...\">louisaem@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Re: raising dogs & pro-life<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In a message dated 1/30/01 6:01:47 PM Pacific Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; I was also serious when I expressed amusement that in the very same<br/>\n&gt;week<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  birth control clinics are condemned but dog breeding is condemned too.<br/>\n&gt;NO<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  more dogs; LOTS more people.

Not all pro-life views include a ban on <br/>\n&gt;birth<br/>\n&gt; &gt; control.  The belief is that the unborn is already fully human and thus <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not a promotion of more humans but the same right to life as those <br/>\n&gt;already<br/>\n&gt; &gt; born.  Many people who embrace a pro-life view are in favor of and<br/>\n&gt;practice<br/>\n&gt; &gt; birth control, usually those methods which prevent fertilization rather<br/>\n&gt;than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; implantation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kris<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 23<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Tue, 30 Jan 2001 23:14:52 -0600<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Cindy L.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:clappin@...\">clappin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Re: raising dogs &  pro-life<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, if my husband and I want to have several children, it&#39;s supposed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be o.k. for everyone to share with us their opinions regarding<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sterilization, birth control and abortion, yet we are not supposed to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; share our belief in procreation?

I don&#39;t think the people<br/>\n&gt;who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; question your family size are really coming from a pro-choice stance, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think they&#39;re just obnoxious people who probably think everyone should <br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just like them.  I face the same criticism, but in reverse, we have one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; child, and we have no plans for more.  I am always amazed by the nerve <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people who tell us how unfair we are, how selfish we are not to provide<br/>\n&gt;our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; son with his own little sibling playmate.  I refuse to explain to any of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them why we have an only child, there is no way to win this <br/>\n&gt;conversation,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just as there is no way to win an argument on abortion.  These are <br/>\n&gt;issues<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that people have already made up their minds on, and too often there is <br/>\n&gt;no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tolerance nor understanding of  anyone who may have a different opinion<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (usually due to having a different life experience).  So congratulations<br/>\n&gt;on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the new baby, and  I wish you & your family continued joy & happiness.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cindy L.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; BTW-  I am non-religious, with deeply held spiritual beliefs.  I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; adamantly pro-choice.  I use natural family planning.  My pregnancy was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unplanned, and seemingly inconvenient- I took it as a profound gift, and <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; never once considered any other option than giving birth, I never had an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ultrasound even though I was in my late 30&#39;s at the time- I have never <br/>\n&gt;had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; such a sense of &#39;faith&#39; as I did with my pregnancy.  I go by my <br/>\n&gt;intuition.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I understand that other people are guided (or not) by their own <br/>\n&gt;intuition,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or beliefs.  I try my best not to judge the choices that other people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make...... Just to explain where I&#39;m coming from.  (I also understand <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; many people think I&#39;m just flaky, that&#39;s ok, too.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 24<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Tue, 30 Jan 2001 23:21:21 -0600<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Vicki A.

My boys have<br/>\n&gt;been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; busy  reading about a certain subject and when they need a break they <br/>\n&gt;then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; draw the subjects. (I would rather not say what it is as I may start<br/>\n&gt;another<br/>\n&gt; &gt; argument! ) It is neat how when an interest is fired kids will really go<br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it. The girls have been playing their horns (sax and clarinet) and <br/>\n&gt;working<br/>\n&gt;on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their various interests. One is learning Japanese ( karate triggered) <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other has been working with the microscope. (science geek) Funny how <br/>\n&gt;being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; housebound changes things. Last week, when we were enjoying warm <br/>\n&gt;weather,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they were outside working on projects there. (My oldest is determined on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; raising the finest blackberries on earth and she has been working and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; studying on that. The other three have been working with the you know<br/>\n&gt;whats.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  It was a nice break this evening to get out of the house and take the<br/>\n&gt;girls<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to karate. It is a 35 mile drive and it was snowing pretty hard, yet we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plowed through mud to get to the highway. Weirdest weather.

We live in snowy South<br/>\n&gt; Dakota (just got 20 inches today).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1.  What ties us all together as unschoolers?  What is the notivation<br/>\nbehind<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it all for everyone?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My motivation for unschooling is simply that it continues to respect<br/>\nAccalia<br/>\n&gt; individuality as she grows. That&#39;s why I practice attachment parenting and<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s what drew me to unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2.  What does everyone do for discipline when it&#39;s needed?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Truthfully we haven&#39;t had to do much &quot;discipline&quot; around here. Accalia&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; getting past the point where distraction always works, but so far I&#39;ve<br/>\nfound<br/>\n&gt; that she responds quite well to me explaining my reasoning and helping her<br/>\n&gt; to express her feelings of frustration, anger, sadness, etc. I know this<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t be as easy as she gets older, but we&#39;ll take it one day at a time<br/>\n:).<br/>\n&gt; I guess you could say we use gentle and positive discipline. I take a lot<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; my ideas from The Discipline Book by Sears. I do not use violence in any<br/>\nway<br/>\n&gt; - no spanking, no yelling. And I&#39;m not too excited about timeouts as so<br/>\nmany<br/>\n&gt; people seem to use them to punish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4.  If there are no uns/hs families around your area, what types of<br/>\npeople do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you like to hang out with/seek out?  The types of people that you find<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most rewarding for your family.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since Accalia is still so young, I&#39;m not actively seeking out uns/hs<br/>\n&gt; families. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be very successful in this area either.  I do<br/>\n&gt; have friends with children close in age to Accalia who follow the same<br/>\n&gt; parenting principles I do. Those parents are who I spend most of my social<br/>\n&gt; time with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What really are the most important goals for us all?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My goals for Accalia is that she will be happy with who she is, never<br/>\nafraid<br/>\n&gt; to learn more or search for the answers and for her to know that she can<br/>\n&gt; always rely on her family.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Amy<br/>\n&gt; Mama to Accalia (6/14/99)<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The hardest to learn was the least complicated&quot; -Indigo Girls<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 5<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 30 Jan 2001 18:09:02 -0800<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:megates@...\">megates@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: borax and the environment<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I found this link on the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://simpleliving.net\">http://simpleliving.net</a><br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if this book is in the library, but it sounded helpful in<br/>\n&gt; making choices.<br/>\n&gt; Mary Ellen<br/>\n&gt; Gain weight...

Bus or car? Old house or new? Cloth diapers or<br/>\n&gt; disposable? Some choices have a huge impact on the environment; others<br/>\n&gt; are of negligible importance. To those of us who care about our quality<br/>\n&gt; of life and what is happening to the earth, this is a vastly important<br/>\n&gt; issue. In these pages, the Union of Concerned Scientists help inform<br/>\n&gt; consumers about everyday decisions that significantly affect the<br/>\n&gt; environment. For example, a few major decisions -- such as the choice of<br/>\n&gt; a house or vehicle -- have such a disproportionately large affect on the<br/>\n&gt; environment that minor environmental infractions shrink by comparison.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This book identifies the 4 Most Significant Consumer-Related<br/>\n&gt; Environmental Problems, the 7 Most Damaging Spending Categories, 11<br/>\n&gt; Priority Actions, and 7 Rules for Responsible Consumption. Learn what you<br/>\n&gt; can do to have a truly significant impact on our world from the people<br/>\n&gt; who are at the forefront of scientific research.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Excerpts:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Consumers are often severely limited in their choices, and the economic<br/>\n&gt; market is frequently structured in such a way that makes environmentally<br/>\n&gt; sound options unattractive. In other cases, businesses and other<br/>\n&gt; institutions, rather than individual consumers, are the key<br/>\n&gt; decision-makers. Government can, and should, help expand the choices,<br/>\n&gt; make responsible behavior appealing, and influence the behavior of<br/>\n&gt; institutions. Good government policies are needed for action on the<br/>\n&gt; personal lifestyle level to succeed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Reviews:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Too many people drive their Land Rovers to the grocery store and think<br/>\n&gt; that &#39;paper or plastic&#39; is a meaningful choice. The Consumer&#39;s Guide To<br/>\n&gt; Effective Environmental Choices will help you distinguish the crucial<br/>\n&gt; from the trivial and make choices that are congruent with your values.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Denis Hayes, Chair, Earth Day 2000<br/>\n&gt; This engaging book gives consumers the information they need to vote with<br/>\n&gt; their wallets for a better environmental future.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gary Hirshberg, President, Stonyfield Farm Yogurt<br/>\n&gt; About The Author:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Michael Brower, Ph.D., is a physicist and expert on energy and<br/>\n&gt; environmental issues.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Warren Leon, Ph.D., is a deputy director for programs at the Union of<br/>\n&gt; Concerned Scientists.

Unfortunately, no matter what cause is being taken<br/>\n&gt; up by the people, there are some radicals.  This is true with women&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; rights, minority&#39;s rights, government protestors, as well as people<br/>\n&gt; on both sides of abortion.  What constitutes violence is obviously an<br/>\n&gt; opinion here since photos of tiny feet or movies depicting the<br/>\n&gt; reality of what abortion is have to come from somewhere.  In my<br/>\n&gt; opinion, a violent act had to take place in order for there to be<br/>\n&gt; mutilated body parts.  Do people really want to see these images?  I<br/>\n&gt; personally don&#39;t, but that doesn&#39;t hide the fact that these acts are<br/>\n&gt; taking place and we call it &quot;abortion&quot; and it&#39;s supposed to be o.k.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since I was responding to a comment made, &quot;...that they can have an<br/>\n&gt; entirely horrible life of abuse and deprivation is pooh-poohed by<br/>\n&gt; right-wing Christians in comfortable homes who don&#39;t let their<br/>\n&gt; children associate with the very people whose reproductive rights<br/>\n&gt; they want to control.&quot;, I&#39;m wondering why it is alright to voice this<br/>\n&gt; strong and not necessarily accurate view, yet it seems so offensive<br/>\n&gt; to some that my view is pro-life.  Did I place judgement or call &quot;pro-<br/>\n&gt; choicers&quot; anything but that?  Am I responding to left-wing Atheists?<br/>\n&gt; Did I tell anyone that their opinion is &quot;the lamest bunch of nonsense<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen in a long time.&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    &gt;&gt;Do you think that you have some &quot;God Given&quot; right to shove your<br/>\n&gt; beliefs down our throats, while we have no rights since we don&#39;t all<br/>\n&gt; prescribe to the rules of your god.  This seems totally unfair and<br/>\n&gt; hypocrital of you.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And rights?  Someone felt that they had the &quot;right&quot; to label and make<br/>\n&gt; clear their &quot;pro-choice&quot; beliefs, whether I wanted to read it or<br/>\n&gt; not.  But that&#39;s not shoving something down some of our throats?  I<br/>\n&gt; do believe that we all have the &quot;right&quot; to our opinion and free-will,<br/>\n&gt; whether you &quot;prescribe to the rules of my God&quot; or not.  Opinion and<br/>\n&gt; free-will were expressed in the original post regarding abortion, yet<br/>\n&gt; this is not unfair or hypocritical of that person.  I do not<br/>\n&gt; understand how that can be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d also like to say that my original intention was not to offend the<br/>\n&gt; author or the other users on this site.  I see that some of you have<br/>\n&gt; no problem responding to this with the intention to offend.  I also<br/>\n&gt; know that your beliefs certainly won&#39;t be changed by my posts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, if my husband and I want to have several children, it&#39;s supposed<br/>\n&gt; to be o.k. for everyone to share with us their opinions regarding<br/>\n&gt; sterilization, birth control and abortion, yet we are not supposed to<br/>\n&gt; share our belief in procreation?  Again, I do not understand how that<br/>\n&gt; can be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It does sadden me to see how compassionate people can be toward the<br/>\n&gt; animals killed daily in our country, but that same compassion does<br/>\n&gt; not seem to spill over to the humans killed daily in our country.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt; Mommy to Jason (8), Angela (6-1/2), Daniel (3-1/2) and baby due in<br/>\n&gt; March!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Debbie & K.C.

I am a practicing Catholic and many of my closet friends, both<br/>\n&gt; spiritually and neighborly are baptists.  Do I support the radical<br/>\npro-life<br/>\n&gt; movement that burns clinics and kills people?  Of course not, and I&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt; hard pressed to name one person in my parish of well over a thousand<br/>\nfamilies<br/>\n&gt; who would support that kind of violence.  In fact, I&#39;d be hard pressed to<br/>\n&gt; find a single person in my parish who would consider any other person of<br/>\nany<br/>\n&gt; religion &quot;evil.&quot;  In fact, our priests regularly use protestant Christians<br/>\n&gt; and members of other faiths as examples of holy life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While I certainly know from personal experience that<br/>\n&gt; some people of faith aren&#39;t tolerant, I am quite reluctant to group<br/>\neveryone<br/>\n&gt; together.   If anyone wants a generalization of Catholicism that works<br/>\n&gt; for me, it is that we believe that Christ came to redeem the world--and at<br/>\nsome<br/>\n&gt; point everyone will be redeemed.  Do I understand how that will work?<br/>\n&gt; Of course not, and I really don&#39;t want to know.  But do I believe that if<br/>\n&gt; Christ would die to redeem the world-- every single person with every<br/>\nsingle<br/>\n&gt; idiosyncrasy, can I condemn anyone?  I think not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes people who are part of the radical fringe are<br/>\n&gt; just that--radically unbalanced.  Probably whatever group gave them some<br/>\n&gt; acceptance would be the beneficiary of their unbalanced sense of<br/>\n&gt; allegiance.  I love life, and that will cause me to get involved and help<br/>\n&gt; anyone I can to live a full life--old person, sick person, lonely person,<br/>\n&gt; condemned person, unborn person.  Yet, I could never take it upon myself<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; judge and condemn another&#39;s actions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But please, don&#39;t take the old shibboleths and give<br/>\n&gt; them new life.

Do I support the radical<br/>\n&gt; pro-life<br/>\n&gt; &gt; movement that burns clinics and kills people?  Of course not, and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hard pressed to name one person in my parish of well over a<br/>\n&gt; thousand families<br/>\n&gt; &gt; who would support that kind of violence.  In fact, I&#39;d be hard<br/>\n&gt; pressed to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; find a single person in my parish who would consider any other<br/>\n&gt; person of any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; religion &quot;evil.&quot;  In fact, our priests regularly use protestant<br/>\n&gt; Christians<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and members of other faiths as examples of holy life.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; While I certainly know from personal experience that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some people of faith aren&#39;t tolerant, I am quite reluctant to group<br/>\n&gt; everyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; together.

Do I understand how that will<br/>\n&gt; work?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Of course not, and I really don&#39;t want to know.  But do I believe<br/>\n&gt; that if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Christ would die to redeem the world-- every single person with<br/>\n&gt; every single<br/>\n&gt; &gt; idiosyncrasy, can I condemn anyone?  I think not.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sometimes people who are part of the radical fringe are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just that--radically unbalanced.  Probably whatever group gave them<br/>\n&gt; some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; acceptance would be the beneficiary of their unbalanced sense of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; allegiance.

All you have to lose is one or<br/>\n&gt; two things out of a game and it becomes a lot less fun, if not impossible,<br/>\n&gt; to play. The pieces get scattered around then the games are no good. This<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; the downside of a messy house as far as I&#39;m concerned. (We also lose<br/>\nbigger<br/>\n&gt; things like books, reading glasses, remote controls and toys, but at least<br/>\n&gt; they seem to show up eventually.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps other people are better than I am at getting their kids to put<br/>\naway<br/>\n&gt; their games when they decide to do something else (&quot;when they are finished<br/>\n&gt; with them&quot; would be misleading, since they&#39;re always quitting halfway<br/>\n&gt; through and running off without a glance backward). You would think that<br/>\n&gt; after having puzzles, games, models and other items with small pieces<br/>\n&gt; rendered unusable because parts had been lost, that they&#39;d be more<br/>\n&gt; conscientious, but nooooo. They don&#39;t waste much time regretting that<br/>\ntheir<br/>\n&gt; games and puzzles are ruined, but I&#39;m sorry about it because I think those<br/>\n&gt; things offer valuable learning experiences (plus they cost money, after<br/>\n&gt; all).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My boys are 8 and 4.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By the way, I have been on this list for a long time, and reading<br/>\n&gt; everything, but lurking a lot lately.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Annette<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 22<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 30 Jan 2001 23:31:19 EST<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:louisaem@...\">louisaem@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re: raising dogs & pro-life<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 1/30/01 6:01:47 PM Pacific Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; I was also serious when I expressed amusement that in the very same<br/>\nweek<br/>\n&gt;  birth control clinics are condemned but dog breeding is condemned too.<br/>\nNO<br/>\n&gt;  more dogs; LOTS more people.

I don&#39;t think the people<br/>\nwho<br/>\n&gt; question your family size are really coming from a pro-choice stance, I<br/>\n&gt; think they&#39;re just obnoxious people who probably think everyone should be<br/>\n&gt; just like them.  I face the same criticism, but in reverse, we have one<br/>\n&gt; child, and we have no plans for more.  I am always amazed by the nerve of<br/>\n&gt; people who tell us how unfair we are, how selfish we are not to provide<br/>\nour<br/>\n&gt; son with his own little sibling playmate.  I refuse to explain to any of<br/>\n&gt; them why we have an only child, there is no way to win this conversation,<br/>\n&gt; just as there is no way to win an argument on abortion.  These are issues<br/>\n&gt; that people have already made up their minds on, and too often there is no<br/>\n&gt; tolerance nor understanding of  anyone who may have a different opinion<br/>\n&gt; (usually due to having a different life experience).  So congratulations<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; the new baby, and  I wish you & your family continued joy & happiness.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cindy L.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW-  I am non-religious, with deeply held spiritual beliefs.  I am<br/>\n&gt; adamantly pro-choice.  I use natural family planning.  My pregnancy was<br/>\n&gt; unplanned, and seemingly inconvenient- I took it as a profound gift, and I<br/>\n&gt; never once considered any other option than giving birth, I never had an<br/>\n&gt; ultrasound even though I was in my late 30&#39;s at the time- I have never had<br/>\n&gt; such a sense of &#39;faith&#39; as I did with my pregnancy.  I go by my intuition.<br/>\n&gt; I understand that other people are guided (or not) by their own intuition,<br/>\n&gt; or beliefs.  I try my best not to judge the choices that other people<br/>\n&gt; make...... Just to explain where I&#39;m coming from.  (I also understand that<br/>\n&gt; many people think I&#39;m just flaky, that&#39;s ok, too.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 24<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 30 Jan 2001 23:21:21 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Vicki A.

My boys have<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt; busy  reading about a certain subject and when they need a break they then<br/>\n&gt; draw the subjects. (I would rather not say what it is as I may start<br/>\nanother<br/>\n&gt; argument! ) It is neat how when an interest is fired kids will really go<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; it. The girls have been playing their horns (sax and clarinet) and working<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; their various interests. One is learning Japanese ( karate triggered) and<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; other has been working with the microscope. (science geek) Funny how being<br/>\n&gt; housebound changes things. Last week, when we were enjoying warm weather,<br/>\n&gt; they were outside working on projects there. (My oldest is determined on<br/>\n&gt; raising the finest blackberries on earth and she has been working and<br/>\n&gt; studying on that. The other three have been working with the you know<br/>\nwhats.)<br/>\n&gt;  It was a nice break this evening to get out of the house and take the<br/>\ngirls<br/>\n&gt; to karate. It is a 35 mile drive and it was snowing pretty hard, yet we<br/>\n&gt; plowed through mud to get to the highway. Weirdest weather. The boys<br/>\nprowled<br/>\n&gt; through the adult section at the library, they love non-fiction, while the<br/>\n&gt; girls were in class. Now we are home again and I see my email I wonder<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; has happened. And it is all because my kids bought puppies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hope everyone had a fun day too.<br/>\n&gt; Oh and I forgot, we also played several rousting games of eye-popping<br/>\nbubbu.<br/>\n&gt; I wish we had a big house like Sandra though, then it would have been much<br/>\n&gt; more fun!<br/>\n&gt; :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShop online without a credit card<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rocketcash.com\">http://www.rocketcash.com</a><br/>\nRocketCash, a NetZero subsidiary </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Kerry Kibort","from":"Kerry Kibort &lt;kkibort@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"QUgCYqDuUJVK9Lox2Bj53QyXjQuP8zJDe6_0Si2utZMzzkyIm40p9VYUx3dOtROpQ2GdtEZERm_Eb6HfHGhvWLUZMubUaYU","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Sports/ Boys vs. girls","postDate":"980954721","msgId":15594,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwMTMxMTUyNTIxLjI0NzU3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjkwMDYubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGE4LjEwN2RmZmE2LjI3YTk3MjcwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":15591,"nextInTopic":15597,"prevInTime":15593,"nextInTime":15595,"topicId":15544,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"- - but truly daughter and I are just not that interested -- although we do deliberately cheer for the local football team which Dad hates -- just to bug him!)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1836674786\">-&quot;- but truly daughter and I are just not that <br/>\ninterested -- although we do deliberately cheer for<br/>\nthe local football team <br/>\nwhich Dad hates -- just to bug him!) &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you agree that boys have something inside them<br/>\nthat makes them agressive and rowdy that most girls<br/>\njust dont have.

I know this topic has been discussed before, but I need help.  A good friend is telling me to look into FMS, as she thinks I am a prime candidate for such a diagnosis.  I really am starting to feel like some kind of hypochondriac because I always seem to be sick.  So educate me about FMS, what are key symptoms, and would my family doc even know what it is?  I am really finding that my life is profoundly affected by my consistently poor health, even more so that it always was as a child, since I have kids of my own to care for now and just cannot be sick this much.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, my son has multiple allergy issues, as many of you may know, since we have discussed allergies before too.  He just turned four in December and I have been avoiding intrusive allergy tests because I did not want to put a young child through a lot of torture over them.  Now I am thinking, for his own safety, I need to get in to see an allergist and have some comprehensive testing done on him, as well as myself.  Any advice from parents of allergic and special medical needs children?<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K., <br/>\nSick and Tired of being Sick and Tired<br/>\nCurrently recovering from a Bronchial infection, latest illness<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"discovery6@aol.com","from":"discovery6@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"zmdJihcOvI5LLLAfC9IpJ8uhxOt8JjxgX3mDZNfoVHlPpwKHxfdKDkLNlEBt_WuOdD0xpkw3DaEw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Say...

My boys have been <br/>\nbusy  reading about a certain subject and when they need a break they then <br/>\ndraw the subjects. (I would rather not say what it is as I may start another <br/>\nargument! ) It is neat how when an interest is fired kids will really go with <br/>\nit. The girls have been playing their horns (sax and clarinet) and working on <br/>\ntheir various interests. One is learning Japanese ( karate triggered) and the <br/>\nother has been working with the microscope. (science geek) Funny how being <br/>\nhousebound changes things. Last week, when we were enjoying warm weather, <br/>\nthey were outside working on projects there. (My oldest is determined on <br/>\nraising the finest blackberries on earth and she has been working and <br/>\nstudying on that. The other three have been working with the you know whats.) <br/>\n It was a nice break this evening to get out of the house and take the girls <br/>\nto karate. It is a 35 mile drive and it was snowing pretty hard, yet we <br/>\nplowed through mud to get to the highway. Weirdest weather. The boys prowled <br/>\nthrough the adult section at the library, they love non-fiction, while the <br/>\ngirls were in class. Now we are home again and I see my email I wonder what <br/>\nhas happened. And it is all because my kids bought puppies. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope everyone had a fun day too. <br/>\nOh and I forgot, we also played several rousting games of eye-popping bubbu. <br/>\nI wish we had a big house like Sandra though, then it would have been much <br/>\nmore fun!<br/>\n:)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"unschoolr2@aol.com","from":"unschoolr2@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"iXxTvwVOPGUBR7dzvg4NDikBa2qLgpTcKMi7xEXR6sI0lrz-5Bvn8Bd7mkioyV9MdDmGm_8QOERZ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Say...
