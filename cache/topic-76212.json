This is one I&#39;ve struggled with.  My kid is not a &quot;poster child&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for unschooling in the sense that he isn&#39;t at all interested in academics.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I tended for a long time to feel defensive about that, like it was going <br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make unschoolers look bad or something.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If anything, my son is probably a decent poster child for unschooling; he<br/>\n&gt; likes academic stuff and forever has his nose in a thick book.  (Imagine a<br/>\n&gt; child that looks like a young Ron Weasley but acts like Hermione and wears<br/>\n&gt; Harry Potter glasses for reading.  That&#39;s my son.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But people still tell me how horrible homeschooling is and how reading all<br/>\n&gt; the time is so terrible for him.  You&#39;d think I kept him chained to a chair<br/>\n&gt; and never let him do anything else.  Having a more-academically oriented<br/>\n&gt; child just means that you hear different criticisms.  I&#39;ve been working on<br/>\n&gt; not being so defensive about the socialization one lately, but it&#39;s hard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was ragged on tonight at church by someone who can&#39;t understand why I<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t put Tim in German school, since he&#39;s obviously &quot;so bright&quot; and should<br/>\n&gt; get out of the &quot;American bubble&quot; more often (I live in the American housing<br/>\n&gt; area by the post here in Germany).  I told him that Tim isn&#39;t in German<br/>\n&gt; school because he doesn&#39;t want to be.  The look on his face was priceless;<br/>\n&gt; he couldn&#39;t see why what my kid wanted would be relevant to the discussion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think we&#39;ve been lucky. Mostly, the only people who are negative about <br/>\nJulian&#39;s homeschooling (unschooling is just SUCH a foreign concept!) are his <br/>\npaternal grandmother, who would no doubt disapprove of something, anyway, since she <br/>\nstill thinks I am Satan, and she&#39;s just like that, and Julian&#39;s dad&#39;s now <br/>\nex-wife, whom we also don&#39;t have to deal with much anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people talk to Juls they often gush about how smart, etc. he is. And <br/>\ntalking to him, they really don&#39;t get just how anti-social my darling boy is!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76211,"nextTopicId":76213}}
