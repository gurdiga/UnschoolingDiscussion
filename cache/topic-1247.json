I took my GED without studying in 1985 a few months<br/>\nafter dropping out of Highschool and turning 16. I dropped out because<br/>\nmy gpa dropped below a 3.75. I saw no point in continuing in that<br/>\nnegative social environment that had totally eroded my sense of self<br/>\nworth despite my good grades. You can&#39;t spend 11 years in a situation<br/>\nwhere you are told on a daily basis that you are not acceptable, no<br/>\nmatter what you do, because of how you look (I was poor and fat) without<br/>\nit having some negative effect on you. I can&#39;t even begin to list all<br/>\nthe awful, horrible things I have endured in my life since I left school<br/>\nbecause of what happened to me in school. I have now, finally, almost 15<br/>\nyrs later, begun to realize that I have some worth. I couldn&#39;t ever<br/>\nimagine sending my children into that kind of a situation. Looking back<br/>\nI see that my parents would have been great unschooling parents if only<br/>\nthey had known it was an option. My home life was full of learning<br/>\nopportunities. I remember my parents taking us with them almost<br/>\neverywhere, even places most people wouldn&#39;t take their children. I<br/>\nalways thought we were different because all three of us could socialize<br/>\nwell with adults from a very early age, we just had trouble with our<br/>\npeers. It turns out that this is a more desirable situation. My children<br/>\ncan also socialize well with people of all ages. It makes no sense to me<br/>\nthat the system expects children to learn in a peer segregated<br/>\nsituation. I was so peer dependant it wasn&#39;t funny, but take me away<br/>\nfrom that situation and I fit in pretty well. Anyway, I am sure I am<br/>\npreaching to the choir.  I just wanted to add my .02 to the fray.  I<br/>\nthank God for giving me the opportunity to learn that there is life not<br/>\nonly beyond school but without school completely.  btw, when i got my<br/>\nGED I went to community college for a few quarters and the social<br/>\nsituation there was so different than High School. I believe more so<br/>\nthan a University would be since many of the people at the community<br/>\ncollege were older, going back for further education, as opposed to a<br/>\nuniversity where the majority are fresh out of highschool. I highly<br/>\nrecommend it as a transitional place for teens who want to go to<br/>\ncollege.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWho mentioned Star Trek a while back? I missed the beginning of that<br/>\none.
