It makes perfect sense when I see <br/>\n&gt; it already done, but how do you decide which smaller numbers to separate <br/>\n&gt; the big number into?  If I look at it, I can easily see that 4600 and 230 <br/>\n&gt; are evenly divisible by 23, but I&#39;m not sure I would ever have thought to <br/>\n&gt; use those two specific numbers.  And I *never* have guessed that 161 would <br/>\n&gt; be evenly divisible by 23.  So I guess my question is how to decide which <br/>\n&gt; numbers to split the big one into.

Long division is a clever <br/>\n&gt; process that breaks the guessing down into smaller steps.  You make one <br/>\n&gt; guess for each digit.  When you multiply and then subtract, you find what&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; left over and you start guessing again.  Guessing once for each digit of <br/>\n&gt; the number you&#39;re dividing is far easier than trying to guess the whole <br/>\n&gt; answer at once, and less time-consuming if you don&#39;t have a calculator <br/>\n&gt; (assuming you remember the process).<br/>\n&gt;     The distributive property was a guiding principle for whoever invented <br/>\n&gt; long division, but you can see how it applies only after the whole problem <br/>\n&gt; is done.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Loren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":54577558,"authorName":"bubhouse@aol.com","from":"bubhouse@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: THANKS, LOREN----4th grade long division revisited","postDate":"1026853292","msgId":39230,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI2LjJhYWVkMDg1LjJhNjVlM2FjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39174,"nextInTopic":39231,"prevInTime":39229,"nextInTime":39231,"topicId":39141,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

For those <br/>\nof you who are math-averse, you might have to read this several times to <br/>\nunderstand it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you do the multiplicaton problem 3 x 9, you can make it more interesting <br/>\nby writing the 9 as 4+5:<br/>\n<br/>\n       3 x (4 + 5)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt turns out that you can multiply the 3 by the 4 and 5 separately, and add <br/>\nthem together to get the answer:<br/>\n<br/>\n       3 x (4 + 5) = (3 x 4) + (3 x 5) = 12 + 15 = 27<br/>\n<br/>\nCool, eh?  You get the same answer as when you just multiply 3 x 9 = 27.  If <br/>\nthis seems mysterious, draw a 3 x 9 rectangle and draw the 27 squares inside <br/>\nit.  Now draw a bold line to separate it into two rectangles: a 3x4 and a 3x5 <br/>\nrectangle.  One rectangle represents the problem 3x4 = 12, and the other <br/>\nrepresents 3x5 = 15, and together these equal 27.<br/>\n       So the distributive property says you can split one of the numbers <br/>\nbeing multiplied and do two separate multiplication problems.  (You can split <br/>\nit into three or more numbers too)<br/>\n       Long division is the reverse of this.  When you divide a large number <br/>\nby a smaller number, the large number splits up into several pieces and you <br/>\ndo several separate division problems.  For example divide 4991 by 23 (do it <br/>\nnow if you want to understand what follows).  The answer is 217.  The series <br/>\nof guessed multiplication problems and subtraction shows you that 4991 can be <br/>\nsplit into three numbers: 4600 + 230 + 161.  Each of these divides evenly by <br/>\n23:<br/>\n<br/>\n       4600 / 23 = 200       230 / 23 = 10           161 / 23 = 7<br/>\n<br/>\nand 200 + 10 + 7 = 217.  In other words, the whole process is the opposite of <br/>\nthe multiplication problem<br/>\n<br/>\n       23 x 217 = 23 x (200 + 10 + 7) = 4600 + 230 + 161 = 4991<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there you go.  Perhaps you didn&#39;t learn this in 4th grade.  It&#39;s not <br/>\nlikely you learned it in high school either.<br/>\n       People who think that drilling kids with paper and pencil arithmetic <br/>\nis all-important justify it by saying that it teaches basic concepts used <br/>\nlater.  But this seems backwards.  It makes sense to learn a practical skill <br/>\nwithout understanding it if you are going to use it a lot.  But if you say <br/>\nyou are teaching for understanding, you should focus on the concept before <br/>\nteaching the skill that is based on it, or at least be sure that the concept <br/>\nfollows shortly.  In the case of long division, practically no one uses it <br/>\nlater - they use calculators - and no one understands the basic concepts it <br/>\nis supposed to illuminate.<br/>\n       I&#39;m not going to teach my kids long division, unless they ask me to <br/>\nshow them.  I&#39;ll teach them multiplication and division by drawing rectangles <br/>\nand using lots of manipulatives before they do the written versions.  In my <br/>\nmind, it is much more important to thoroughly know that division is the <br/>\nopposite of multiplication and that it involves guessing the answer.  Long <br/>\ndivision is just a refined and efficient way to guess the answer.<br/>\n       I have actually asked high-school students, after they have completed <br/>\na division problem, &quot;How would figure out whether that&#39;s the right answer?&quot;  <br/>\nSome of them, after a long pause and a few prompts, will say something like <br/>\n&quot;work backwards and do the multiplication problem to see if you get the first <br/>\nnumber,&quot; but most will just draw a blank.  Or they&#39;ll say to do it over to <br/>\nsee if you get the same answer again, which takes longer.  Teaching long <br/>\ndivision doesn&#39;t generally teach kids the underlying concepts.<br/>\n       But you never know.  Maybe an asteroid heading toward earth some day <br/>\nwill break into several thousand little asteroids and destroy all the <br/>\ncalculator factories in the world.  In that case, it will be a good thing we <br/>\nall know how to do long division, if we happen to actually remember it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEgads, I think there&#39;s a whole book chapter in this.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\n<br/>\nLoren Kelley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39191,"nextTopicId":39248}}
