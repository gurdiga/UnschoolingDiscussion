Oh, ..&lt;whatever&gt;&quot;.)  His <br/>\nrevised comment was that he should not have done this.  Well, every day my <br/>\ndaughter makes mistakes like this, which, when you think about it, are quite <br/>\nlogical (by what logical explanation is &quot;took&quot; is the past tense of <br/>\n&quot;take&quot;?), but incorrect.  I&#39;ve been resisting the impulse to directly <br/>\ncorrect her, but she doesn&#39;t seem to be picking up on the correct past tense <br/>\nof words, even though we use them correctly.  What do most of you do?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my mom being a school teacher, (ex now) I remember growing up always <br/>\nbeing corrected in my grammer. I absolutely hated it. I guess maybe that&#39;s <br/>\nwhy I don&#39;t do it to my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just let them go, if they ask, I answer. Something cute was when Joseph <br/>\nwas little, he made up a word, amn&#39;t. As in &quot;I am not dong that.&quot; It made <br/>\nsense to me that he used it and Sierra being 13 months right behind him, <br/>\npicked it up too. I thought it was rather cute and it didn&#39;t really bother <br/>\nme that it wasn&#39;t a real word. It was to them. Sadly, I hardly ever hear <br/>\nthat word anymore. (sigh)<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce in awhile, Joseph (7) or Sierra (6) will say something and look at me <br/>\nafter they use a word, almost knowing it doesn&#39;t sound right. That&#39;s when <br/>\nI&#39;ll give them the right one. Only one I can think of right now is saying <br/>\nheared instead of heard. Other than that, I let it go and as of now, see no <br/>\nproblem in them using words that don&#39;t always go. Once in a while one will <br/>\ncome up, but&#39;s what the big deal?

With my second son, though, I finally had to start correcting him so I, and other people, could figure out what he was saying. A typical sentence from him would be &quot;me wanted that was gone, purple thing now, he said no, it were over there&quot;. Now how many people could translate that into &quot;I wanted it, but it&#39;s gone, so I want the purple thing now, but Brett said no because it wasn&#39;t over there&quot;??? LOL So my opinion would be that it depends on the child!<br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just something I&#39;ve been thinking about lately, and would like some <br/>\n  opinions/experiences of others.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I &quot;How Children Learn&quot;, the revised edition where John added further <br/>\n  comment, and at one point, he details how he would try little tricks to <br/>\n  try to subtly correct children&#39;s speech (i.e. if the child said &quot;I breaked <br/>\n  it&quot;, he would repeat back at them &quot;You broke it?  Oh, ..&lt;whatever&gt;&quot;.)  His <br/>\n  revised comment was that he should not have done this.  Well, every day my <br/>\n  daughter makes mistakes like this, which, when you think about it, are <br/>\n  quite logical (by what logical explanation is &quot;took&quot; is the past tense of <br/>\n  &quot;take&quot;?), but incorrect.  I&#39;ve been resisting the impulse to directly <br/>\n  correct her, but she doesn&#39;t seem to be picking up on the correct past <br/>\n  tense of words, even though we use them correctly.  What do most of you <br/>\n  do?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for the input!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
