For us unschooling is more than &quot;schooling&quot;.  By that I mean <br/>\n&gt; it is <br/>\n&gt; more than your approach to education.  It is the way we live.  How <br/>\n&gt; we treat <br/>\n&gt; our children.  For us it means that our children are people already <br/>\n&gt; living <br/>\n&gt; and being. ( I hate that question:  &quot;what are you going to be when <br/>\n&gt; you grow <br/>\n&gt; up?&quot;) We treat our children with respect and I believe that they are <br/>\n&gt; doing <br/>\n&gt; the best they can all the time.  I let them decide how they want to <br/>\n&gt; spend <br/>\n&gt; their time each and every day.  They are intelligent people and <br/>\n&gt; learn what <br/>\n&gt; they need to learn to do what they want to do.  I am just a <br/>\n&gt; facilitator.  I <br/>\n&gt; have more life experience and may have more ideas about where the <br/>\n&gt; information <br/>\n&gt; they need is located, someone that can help, books, museums, <br/>\n&gt; classes, etc <br/>\n&gt; etc.  I may be able to help them locate what it is they are <br/>\n&gt; searching for.  <br/>\n&gt; And we learn together.  <br/>\n&gt; Just some of the thoughts rambling around in my head.<br/>\n&gt; LOL<br/>\n&gt; Pam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Pam.
