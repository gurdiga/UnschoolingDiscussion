Say.....&lt;whatever&gt;.<br/>\n&gt; It seems legalistic. Just as unschooling looks different in every<br/>\n&gt; home but<br/>\n&gt; follows the same basic guidelines of trust and acceptance, gentle<br/>\n&gt; parenting<br/>\n&gt; looks different as well but follows the same basic guidelines of love<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; respect being a 2 way street.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is the hardest thing for me about unschooling.  Knowing when or<br/>\n&gt; if ever I can say no.  Knowing where the line is between my personal<br/>\n&gt; boundaries and making sure my kids are emotionally whole and feel<br/>\n&gt; loved.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And still wondering if I&#39;ll ever grasp how to master finding time for<br/>\n&gt; my own interests and work.  Just a few weeks ago someone (Julie?)<br/>\n&gt; said she has five kids and still does all this amazing (to me) amount<br/>\n&gt; of work with them around.  I&#39;m in awe, because I don&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; An example...<br/>\n&gt; Today one of Alisha&#39;s friends was having a yard sale, so we went and<br/>\n&gt; visited their sale.  Then we went to a few other yard sales and found<br/>\n&gt; some neat stuff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Luke had to go to the bathroom on the way home, so we stopped at a<br/>\n&gt; grocery store (closest bathroom).  When we walked past the salad bar,<br/>\n&gt; he wanted some things off of it, so I let him fill up a container.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The boys hadn&#39;t wanted to go to yard sales, so I convinced them by<br/>\n&gt; telling them we could stop and get milkshakes afterwards, so we<br/>\n&gt; stopped for milkshakes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At one of the sales Alisha and I found some new yugioh cards, so<br/>\n&gt; Alisha asked me to play yugioh with her when we got home.  She set<br/>\n&gt; the cards up while I hung a load of laundry outside.  I took a break<br/>\n&gt; at one point to make english muffins, pour drinks, and go see<br/>\n&gt; something that the boys had made outside.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After playing several games, Alisha and I looked up some stuff about<br/>\n&gt; yugioh online.  Then I started making supper, but dh had to finish<br/>\n&gt; that because Matt shut the door on his toe and needed my attention.<br/>\n&gt; I bandaided him up and it still hurt and he needed me to sit and hold<br/>\n&gt; him for awhile.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After supper I looked something up online for Matt.  He really liked<br/>\n&gt; something that he bought at the yardsale and wanted to know if he<br/>\n&gt; could buy something similar somewhere.  Then Alisha asked me to play<br/>\n&gt; yugioh some more.  I asked if she could clear the table while I got<br/>\n&gt; the laundry in off the line, and she did.  We played 2 more games and<br/>\n&gt; then spent awhile looking through all the cards not in our decks and<br/>\n&gt; deciding what we could part with.  She wants to have a yard sale now<br/>\n&gt; too, and wants to sell her extra yugioh cards there.  As we were<br/>\n&gt; looking through the cards, something sparked a question she&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; wondered about from seeing it on her video game.  She asked what<br/>\n&gt; pyro, hydro, aero, and geo meant.  I knew what they meant and told<br/>\n&gt; her, but looked up geo in the dictionary to make sure I was right.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I made a 5 minute phone call to discuss with a friend plans for some<br/>\n&gt; clubs Alisha wants to get involved in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I took a shower and then lay, read, and sang with Alisha and then<br/>\n&gt; Matt on their beds before they went to sleep.  (Luke went to bed with<br/>\n&gt; dh).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I came down, ran the dishwasher, did a load of dishes by hand.  Now<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m up too late finding time for myself online.  I&#39;ll probably throw<br/>\n&gt; in a load of laundry before bed so it&#39;s ready to get hung up in the<br/>\n&gt; morning, and I&#39;d like to read some of my book but will probably fall<br/>\n&gt; asleep after 1 or 2 pages.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m NOT complaining about being home with and spending lots of time<br/>\n&gt; with my kids.  Really!  I just wonder if there&#39;s something I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not &quot;getting&quot;.  I&#39;ve been reading about moms getting lots of work<br/>\n&gt; done even with 5 kids in the house and how moms should pursue<br/>\n&gt; interests on their own.  When I do really need to get work done or<br/>\n&gt; pursue an interest for myself it usually involves telling a kid no.<br/>\n&gt; I might have time in a few hours, or maybe tomorrow, but not now.<br/>\n&gt; Then they&#39;re sad and I feel bad. Last week I went out for lunch with<br/>\n&gt; a friend and Alisha, who&#39;s almost 11, begged me not to go.  She would<br/>\n&gt; miss me too much.  Her dad was home with her, and they get along<br/>\n&gt; great. Yet some of you go to work...don&#39;t your kids ask you not to<br/>\n&gt; ever leave them?   The only work I got done today was 2 loads of<br/>\n&gt; laundry and food prep.  I did the dishes after everyone else was<br/>\n&gt; asleep.  Is that bad?  Should I be able to get more done when my kids<br/>\n&gt; are around?  They ask me to do stuff with them constantly.  Not that<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t ever do stuff on their own, but usually what happens is<br/>\n&gt; that while one child is off doing something on his own, a different<br/>\n&gt; child wants my attention.  Usually I&#39;m doing something with someone.<br/>\n&gt; Is there something wrong that my kids want so much of me?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m very concerned about doing it all &quot;right&quot;.  I want my kids to be<br/>\n&gt; emotionally whole and healthy and feeling very loved by their mom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Back to the &quot;I&#39;m not a short order cook&quot; theme...  IS there ever a<br/>\n&gt; time when you can say, &quot;No, I&#39;m tired, I can&#39;t get that right now?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Example...All day long I got Luke everything he wanted to eat and<br/>\n&gt; drink.  No problem. For supper, I made hamburgers which I knew he<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t want, so I made hot dogs too.  Dh cut the hot dog up for<br/>\n&gt; him, I got him ketchup on his plate, got him a fork.  Poured him a<br/>\n&gt; drink.  He wanted to take his plate to the couch (a few feet from the<br/>\n&gt; table to watch tv), so he did.  Dh and I sat down to eat, kind of<br/>\n&gt; tired, and as soon as I did, Luke said, &quot;Bring me my drink, Mommy&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; He had carried his plate in, sat down and got comfortable, and<br/>\n&gt; realized he had forgotten his drink.  I was tired.  I said, &quot;Honey,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m really tired.  Why don&#39;t you come get your drink.&quot;  He said no.<br/>\n&gt; Dh said, &quot;Well, it&#39;s right here whenever you want it.&quot;  He asked in a<br/>\n&gt; whiny voice several more times and I was about to get up and get it<br/>\n&gt; for him but then he finally did come out and get it himself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In situations like that it&#39;s hard for me to know if I should just<br/>\n&gt; always breathe and put a smile on my face and get up and serve, no<br/>\n&gt; matter how tired I am, or can I sometimes say, &quot;I&#39;m tired honey, why<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t you get it&quot;.  And if he still says no, you get it, do I then do<br/>\n&gt; it no matter what?  I can&#39;t imagine getting lots of work or pursuing<br/>\n&gt; interesting things on my own without sometimes saying, &quot;No, I&#39;m tired<br/>\n&gt; or busy, you&#39;ll have to get it this time&quot;.  or &quot;No, we just played<br/>\n&gt; for 3 hours and now I need an hour to myself&quot;.  But does doing that<br/>\n&gt; make them feel unloved?  Shouldn&#39;t I always meet their needs first<br/>\n&gt; and THEN meet my needs if there&#39;s ever any time left over?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sheila<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

That&#39;s not a &quot;bad habit&quot; - that&#39;s just being a <br/>\nhuman. ANY of us could do the same thing. I&#39;ve I&#39;d settled into a comfy <br/>\nposition with my food and then realized I&#39;d forgotten to bring my <br/>\ndrink, I&#39;d look up to see if anybody was in a good position to hand it <br/>\nto me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a situation at our house that is new - in the late evenings <br/>\nthere are usually several of us sitting together in the living room, <br/>\nwith our laptops, playing a game, or watching something on tv.  <br/>\nRecently, our dog has been wanting to go in and out the back door way <br/>\nmore often than she ever has before - I don&#39;t know what the problem is, <br/>\nshe goes out and wanders around and then wants back in and then out and <br/>\nthen in.... Anyway - we don&#39;t have a doggy door because we&#39;ve never <br/>\nneeded one, but now we&#39;re having to get up and down all the time. We <br/>\nare all getting a little tired of it and I hope she&#39;ll just stop doing <br/>\nit, soon. But I noticed something nice. We seem to just kind of <br/>\nnaturally share the chore of getting up - kind of taking turns in an <br/>\nunspoken rotation. If the kids are busy and I&#39;m just reading email, I <br/>\nusually do it - so I probably do it more than they do.  But it is WAY <br/>\nharder for me to get up and down off the floor if we&#39;re sitting down <br/>\nthere playing a game and they don&#39;t even expect me to do it at all, in <br/>\nthat case. Nice of them. Thoughtful without even probably giving it <br/>\nmore than a moment&#39;s thought. These are 13, 16, and 19 year old kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little while ago, my husband settled down in his chair to watch a <br/>\nsoccer game on tv that he is very excited by (his favorite English <br/>\nteam, Arsenal, will break a 100+ year record if they win this game). As <br/>\nsoon as he settled in and got the game on and it started, he said, &quot;Oh <br/>\ndarn, I forgot to make my tea.&quot; (He&#39;d boiled the water but forgot to <br/>\nmake it and bring it with him to sit down.) Roxana, 16, was sitting on <br/>\nthe couch nearby, with her laptop. She jumped up and said, &quot;I&#39;ll get <br/>\nit.&quot; She did that. Now 20 minutes later, he just wanted another cup of <br/>\ntea. He looked around and saw Roxana and I both typing away on our <br/>\nlaptops and he didn&#39;t even ask, he just jumped up and went and got it <br/>\nhimself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard work and tiring to have young children. You DO have to watch <br/>\nout for them and help them a lot. A parent could have kept an eye on <br/>\nhim getting his food and reminded him that he&#39;d forgotten his drink or <br/>\nnoticed when he settled down without it and gotten it for him before <br/>\nthey settled down with their own food. It takes effort and attention to <br/>\nparent.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, we don&#39;t have to be perfect and I don&#39;t want this to <br/>\nsound like I have been perfect. I have many times not done something <br/>\nfor my kids that I could have done, just because I was a little tired <br/>\nor doing something myself and didn&#39;t feel like it. I wish I could start <br/>\nfresh - and do better. But it hasn&#39;t ruined my relationship with my <br/>\nchildren or ruined their lives or anything like that. So the trick <br/>\nseems to be to keep striving to do better and better and to give myself <br/>\na break when I am, inevitably, not perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":135006028,"authorName":"Betsy and Chris","from":"&quot;Betsy and Chris&quot; &lt;canderson51@...&gt;","profile":"betsyadair2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: &quot;a taste of his own medicine&quot; andother cruel ideas","postDate":"1084648746","msgId":94113,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjYwMWM0M2FiMSQ3ZGJhNGJjMCQzMDU2NjQ0NEBkYy5kYy5jb3gubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDFlNS4yMDY1NDZkNS4yZGQ3OGZmNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":94105,"nextInTopic":94122,"prevInTime":94112,"nextInTime":94114,"topicId":94037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... negativity that came from parents refusing to do him a little favor.

Why don&#39;t you come get your drink.&quot;  He said no.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDh said, &quot;Well, it&#39;s right here whenever you want it.&quot;  He asked in a <br/>\n<br/>\nwhiny voice several more times and I was about to get up and get it <br/>\n<br/>\nfor him but then he finally did come out and get it himself.  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI would&#39;ve gotten him the drink.  The reason I would have is that if he&#39;s not <br/>\nold enough to cut up his own hot dog (or he needs it cut up) he&#39;s probably <br/>\nnot old enough to carry the hot dog AND a drink, so someone should&#39;ve helped him <br/>\nget situated where he was going to eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nA hot dog needs a drink.

I find Jayn&#39;s whining<br/>\nand misery more exhausting than the effort of heading off the whining by<br/>\naccepting &quot;no, you get it&quot; or &quot;I need you to come with me&quot; (when I have to<br/>\nget out of bed to turn on the bathroom light even though she can turn it on<br/>\nherself and often does) and just staggering up and doing it as quickly as I<br/>\ncan. I&#39;m getting better at staying neutral if not cheerful about being<br/>\nforced out of bed. What happens at the dinner table a lot, is that Jayn asks<br/>\nme for her drink, and dh will get it for her - usually this is OK, sometimes<br/>\nit just has to be me. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;But does doing that <br/>\nmake them feel unloved?  Shouldn&#39;t I always meet their needs first <br/>\nand THEN meet my needs if there&#39;s ever any time left over?&gt;&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking forward to hearing from people with more experience on this one<br/>\ntoo! Is it a matter of understanding the differences between &quot;needs&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;wants&quot;? I don&#39;t know. So much of unschooling is acceptance and trust, even<br/>\nwhen it seems counterintuitive or at least counter to what is accepted<br/>\nconventional wisdom (like the idea that you have to make a child be<br/>\nindependent or they will always be clingy; we do the opposite allow a child<br/>\nto cling as long as they need to and they will become truly independent and<br/>\nconfident). I have to trust that Jayn will become a pleasant, generous and<br/>\nthoughtful person by being kinder to her than many parents who would simply<br/>\ninsist that their child get their own drink, or even be a little servant for<br/>\ntheir parents. My dh remembers constantly being ordered to fetch stuff<br/>\n(including cocktails) for his parents, regardless of his current activity. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it would have occurred to me to ask my mother to fetch me my<br/>\ndrink - since I would have been at the table with no choice in the matter,<br/>\nunless I was actually sick. Actually Jayn is already eager to be helpful and<br/>\nkind - like running to get the phone for me, and helping to clean, or<br/>\noffering to get things for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Say.....&lt;whatever&gt;.<br/>\nIt seems legalistic. Just as unschooling looks different in every <br/>\nhome but<br/>\nfollows the same basic guidelines of trust and acceptance, gentle <br/>\nparenting<br/>\nlooks different as well but follows the same basic guidelines of love <br/>\nand<br/>\nrespect being a 2 way street.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the hardest thing for me about unschooling.  Knowing when or <br/>\nif ever I can say no.  Knowing where the line is between my personal <br/>\nboundaries and making sure my kids are emotionally whole and feel <br/>\nloved.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd still wondering if I&#39;ll ever grasp how to master finding time for <br/>\nmy own interests and work.  Just a few weeks ago someone (Julie?) <br/>\nsaid she has five kids and still does all this amazing (to me) amount <br/>\nof work with them around.  I&#39;m in awe, because I don&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAn example...<br/>\nToday one of Alisha&#39;s friends was having a yard sale, so we went and <br/>\nvisited their sale.  Then we went to a few other yard sales and found <br/>\nsome neat stuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLuke had to go to the bathroom on the way home, so we stopped at a <br/>\ngrocery store (closest bathroom).  When we walked past the salad bar, <br/>\nhe wanted some things off of it, so I let him fill up a container.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe boys hadn&#39;t wanted to go to yard sales, so I convinced them by <br/>\ntelling them we could stop and get milkshakes afterwards, so we <br/>\nstopped for milkshakes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt one of the sales Alisha and I found some new yugioh cards, so <br/>\nAlisha asked me to play yugioh with her when we got home.  She set <br/>\nthe cards up while I hung a load of laundry outside.  I took a break <br/>\nat one point to make english muffins, pour drinks, and go see <br/>\nsomething that the boys had made outside.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter playing several games, Alisha and I looked up some stuff about <br/>\nyugioh online.  Then I started making supper, but dh had to finish <br/>\nthat because Matt shut the door on his toe and needed my attention.  <br/>\nI bandaided him up and it still hurt and he needed me to sit and hold <br/>\nhim for awhile.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter supper I looked something up online for Matt.  He really liked <br/>\nsomething that he bought at the yardsale and wanted to know if he <br/>\ncould buy something similar somewhere.  Then Alisha asked me to play <br/>\nyugioh some more.  I asked if she could clear the table while I got <br/>\nthe laundry in off the line, and she did.  We played 2 more games and <br/>\nthen spent awhile looking through all the cards not in our decks and <br/>\ndeciding what we could part with.  She wants to have a yard sale now <br/>\ntoo, and wants to sell her extra yugioh cards there.  As we were <br/>\nlooking through the cards, something sparked a question she&#39;d <br/>\nwondered about from seeing it on her video game.  She asked what <br/>\npyro, hydro, aero, and geo meant.  I knew what they meant and told <br/>\nher, but looked up geo in the dictionary to make sure I was right.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI made a 5 minute phone call to discuss with a friend plans for some <br/>\nclubs Alisha wants to get involved in. <br/>\n<br/>\nI took a shower and then lay, read, and sang with Alisha and then <br/>\nMatt on their beds before they went to sleep.  (Luke went to bed with <br/>\ndh).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI came down, ran the dishwasher, did a load of dishes by hand.  Now <br/>\nI&#39;m up too late finding time for myself online.  I&#39;ll probably throw <br/>\nin a load of laundry before bed so it&#39;s ready to get hung up in the <br/>\nmorning, and I&#39;d like to read some of my book but will probably fall <br/>\nasleep after 1 or 2 pages. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m NOT complaining about being home with and spending lots of time <br/>\nwith my kids.  Really!  I just wonder if there&#39;s something I&#39;m <br/>\nnot &quot;getting&quot;.  I&#39;ve been reading about moms getting lots of work <br/>\ndone even with 5 kids in the house and how moms should pursue <br/>\ninterests on their own.  When I do really need to get work done or <br/>\npursue an interest for myself it usually involves telling a kid no.  <br/>\nI might have time in a few hours, or maybe tomorrow, but not now.  <br/>\nThen they&#39;re sad and I feel bad. Last week I went out for lunch with <br/>\na friend and Alisha, who&#39;s almost 11, begged me not to go.  She would <br/>\nmiss me too much.  Her dad was home with her, and they get along <br/>\ngreat. Yet some of you go to work...don&#39;t your kids ask you not to <br/>\never leave them?   The only work I got done today was 2 loads of <br/>\nlaundry and food prep.  I did the dishes after everyone else was <br/>\nasleep.  Is that bad?  Should I be able to get more done when my kids <br/>\nare around?  They ask me to do stuff with them constantly.  Not that <br/>\nthey don&#39;t ever do stuff on their own, but usually what happens is <br/>\nthat while one child is off doing something on his own, a different <br/>\nchild wants my attention.  Usually I&#39;m doing something with someone.  <br/>\nIs there something wrong that my kids want so much of me?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m very concerned about doing it all &quot;right&quot;.  I want my kids to be <br/>\nemotionally whole and healthy and feeling very loved by their mom.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the &quot;I&#39;m not a short order cook&quot; theme...  IS there ever a <br/>\ntime when you can say, &quot;No, I&#39;m tired, I can&#39;t get that right now?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nExample...All day long I got Luke everything he wanted to eat and <br/>\ndrink.  No problem. For supper, I made hamburgers which I knew he <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want, so I made hot dogs too.  Dh cut the hot dog up for <br/>\nhim, I got him ketchup on his plate, got him a fork.  Poured him a <br/>\ndrink.  He wanted to take his plate to the couch (a few feet from the <br/>\ntable to watch tv), so he did.  Dh and I sat down to eat, kind of <br/>\ntired, and as soon as I did, Luke said, &quot;Bring me my drink, Mommy&quot;.  <br/>\nHe had carried his plate in, sat down and got comfortable, and <br/>\nrealized he had forgotten his drink.  I was tired.  I said, &quot;Honey, <br/>\nI&#39;m really tired.  Why don&#39;t you come get your drink.&quot;  He said no.  <br/>\nDh said, &quot;Well, it&#39;s right here whenever you want it.&quot;  He asked in a <br/>\nwhiny voice several more times and I was about to get up and get it <br/>\nfor him but then he finally did come out and get it himself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn situations like that it&#39;s hard for me to know if I should just <br/>\nalways breathe and put a smile on my face and get up and serve, no <br/>\nmatter how tired I am, or can I sometimes say, &quot;I&#39;m tired honey, why <br/>\ndon&#39;t you get it&quot;.  And if he still says no, you get it, do I then do <br/>\nit no matter what?  I can&#39;t imagine getting lots of work or pursuing <br/>\ninteresting things on my own without sometimes saying, &quot;No, I&#39;m tired <br/>\nor busy, you&#39;ll have to get it this time&quot;.  or &quot;No, we just played <br/>\nfor 3 hours and now I need an hour to myself&quot;.  But does doing that <br/>\nmake them feel unloved?  Shouldn&#39;t I always meet their needs first <br/>\nand THEN meet my needs if there&#39;s ever any time left over?   <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.

So when I leave him speechless where all he can do is laugh and<br/>\nsay &quot;f**k you&quot;, it is considered high praise, even if it is a cliche that<br/>\nmany consider a put down.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is all I&#39;m saying.

But I&#39;m SO tired of hearing that we have nothing to eat because so often we have PLENTY to eat!<br/>\n<br/>\nI just said &quot;I&#39;m not going to listen to this right now&quot; and went into the house.  It is horribly hot out, we have no air conditioning, the dew point is probably 70.   I&#39;m miserable, she&#39;s miserable, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we went our separate ways for the day.  She did some water fun stuff outside, I cleaned and took a nap.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust this afternoon, as I was driving her up to her friend&#39;s house, I joked that she couldn&#39;t go swimming unless I could get in the pool too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe laughed, and said &quot;you&#39;re good mom&quot; (not sarcastically, she meant it).  I said, &quot;yeah, I&#39;m good, but I don&#39;t know how to get groceries&quot; and winked to acknowledge her earlier frustration.  I was just taking a stressful moment from earlier in the day and making it a non-stressful memory.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I said &quot;you&#39;re a brat&quot;, with the term meant to be endearing.

I smiled and <br/>\nshook my head and said &quot;What if you had said &#39;If you don&#39;t stop doing that I&#39;ll <br/>\nkill you?&#39;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe got it right away. <br/>\n<br/>\nI told him it&#39;s better to change your mind and say &quot;I don&#39;t know why I said <br/>\nthat, sorry,&quot; and just find something better for the kid to do than to stick <br/>\nwith a bad plan.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the nursery lady didn&#39;t really pinch their heads off, but she gave them <br/>\nthe image of the threat of head removal, and that&#39;s not as sweet as she could&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we settle for better-than-parents, we won&#39;t get to best-we-could-be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.

The issue is how do we<br/>\nalways know ahead of time how others are going to hear things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard moms say the sweetest things to their child with the ugliest<br/>\nintent and I have heard moms say the roughest things to their child with the<br/>\nsweetest intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if your relationship is a solid, good, loving one, most people hear<br/>\nthe intent rather than the specific language.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were little, they went to a nursery at church.  The woman<br/>\nworking there was anything but gentle with the kids.  She would say things<br/>\nlike &quot;I&#39;m going to pinch your head off if you do that again.&quot; etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nI was somewhat flabbergasted.  The kids absolutely loved her.
