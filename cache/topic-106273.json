They were about 8 and <br/>\n6, I guess, and just loved to put their hands in my big bin of white flour <br/>\nthat I keep in the basement. It used to bug the crud out of me, and I tried <br/>\nmany things, including not only the standard shouting, but also politely <br/>\nasking, and explaining &quot;why&quot; I didn&#39;t want them sticking their hands in the <br/>\nflour bin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen one day, I set them down on the floor, opened up the bin, and said <br/>\n&quot;Play&quot; Which they did. Hands, arms, legs, faces. Hair. All white with flour. <br/>\nThey played until they were done, when we dusted them off, stuck them in a <br/>\nshower, and I swept up the floor. That cool, soft feeling on their hands <br/>\nmust have been so nice. I figure, it couldn&#39;t have cost me more than five <br/>\nbucks to replace that flour, and they had a terrific time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then, they haven&#39;t stuck their hands in the flour. If they wanted to, <br/>\nwe&#39;d do it again. amazing, what saying &quot;yes&quot; will do.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, Heidic<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;For instance, today he really wanted to play with the raw eggs --<br/>\n&gt;he didn&#39;t understand the difference between the hardboiled ones I<br/>\n&gt;usually give him and the raw ones in the fridge -- so I brought one<br/>\n&gt;raw egg up to the bathtub, stripped him to his diaper, and let him<br/>\n&gt;play with it there.  Boy, was he surprised when it broke!  It was fun<br/>\n&gt;to watch. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106246,"nextTopicId":106274}}
