Almost infintessimal in geological time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am likewise amused by the hole in the ozone.  The sky is falling off!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHOW long have people even thought there WAS an ozone, and they consider <br/>\nthemselves experts in the geological history of the ozone?   It would be like <br/>\nsomeone studying sea level &quot;in great depth&quot; one morning at 11:00 and then freaking <br/>\nout TOTALLY at the tide coming in or going out, and predicting the end of the <br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd global warming...<br/>\nIsn&#39;t it the same scientists who KNOW for certain there have been ice ages <br/>\nlarge and small on earth, that that is a natural state of the earth, to cool and <br/>\nwarm, and that it&#39;s been going on since before there were humans, and yet (as <br/>\nwith the probably origins of some religions and superstitions and practices) <br/>\nsome seem positive that humans have sinned and that&#39;s causing the earth to <br/>\nheat up?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat sins did the dinosaurs commit to cause the world to get colder? <br/>\nWhat wonderful service to God did prehistoric man perform to cause the ice to <br/>\nrecede?  <br/>\nThere was a &quot;mini ice age&quot; within the past thousand years.  No doubt the <br/>\nCatholics could explain that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been theorized that the whole sun-worshipping set of religions came <br/>\nabout from people thinking they had helped the earth warm up again.   When God&#39;s <br/>\nin the sky and darkness is equated with punishment and evil, there is some sun <br/>\nworship going on (anthropologically speaking).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...<br/>\nA first in the solar system.<br/>\nYou heard it on the internet in 2005.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103164,"nextTopicId":103172}}
