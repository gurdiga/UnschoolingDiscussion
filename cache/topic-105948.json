(Describing <br/>\n&quot;practices&quot; is less abstract and more clear, usually.)  When I write or <br/>\nread the word &quot;bedtime&quot;, I&#39;m thinking about a pleasant attachment <br/>\nparenting family in which the scenario is &quot;Let&#39;s all brush our teeth and <br/>\nhave a story and go to bed.&quot;  I don&#39;t naturally picture toddlers in <br/>\ndistress being sent back to their rooms over and over.

(OK, <br/>\nyeah, some people never had the habit.)  If a parent is non-responsive <br/>\nto a child&#39;s cries at an early age, how sensitive can they possibly be <br/>\nat later ages to a child&#39;s needs, wishes, dreams and fears?

I can&#39;t<br/>\nremember what it was in reference to, maybe somebody worrying about<br/>\nMcDonalds and not allowing her/his child(ren) to support a<br/>\nmulti-national conglomerate being more important than supporting<br/>\nher/his families ability to make choices.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that with all of these things it is about priorities.  If your<br/>\npriority is no or little television than allowing freedom of access to<br/>\ntelevision isn&#39;t going to result in no or little television.  My son<br/>\nSimon (8), who has had freedom of access to television since he was 5<br/>\nand for whom we controlled it very little before that can and does<br/>\nwatch television for hours.  However, of late, he has been turning it<br/>\noff and walking away from it far more than ever before.  If someone<br/>\nwere to walk into our home who believed that television was a<br/>\ncorrupting influence we are clearly corrupted. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is free access to food in our house.  There are two bowlfuls of<br/>\nstarburst fruit chews on the kitchen table and carrots and celery cut<br/>\nup and floating in water in the fridge as per my Grandmother; there<br/>\nare packets of crisps in the cupboard with weetabix cereal and muesli<br/>\ncereal and whatever other kind of cereal; there is dried squid and<br/>\nsheets of nori and crackers and peanut butter and chocolate chip<br/>\noatmeal cookies and ice cream and, and, and  All things get eaten. <br/>\nAt the moment Linnaea (5) and Simon are sitting in front of the<br/>\ntelevision watching a video of The Flintstones eating spaghetti<br/>\nnoodles and raw carrots and drinking kool-aid (imported) and talking<br/>\nto me about what &quot;balance&quot; means, based I would guess on the balance<br/>\nof a sword in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;.  If your priority is not<br/>\nletting your children have certain &quot;e numbers&quot; in food or to be<br/>\nvegetarian or vegan or to eat only things without additives, than<br/>\nallowing food choice isn&#39;t necessarily going to end up with a family<br/>\nthat eats the way you want them to eat.  It might, but it probably<br/>\nwon&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you choose to follow the unschooling lifestyle, as opposed to just<br/>\nbeing an unschooling homeschooler, than you have to accept that these<br/>\npeople who are your children will enjoy things in ways you may not<br/>\nlike.  Yesterday Simon ate 3 doughnuts.  He had a couple of bites of<br/>\negg fried rice and a couple of bites of bagel with cream cheese, but<br/>\nreally, he only ate 3 doughnuts.  It drove me mad.  But David<br/>\n(husband) said sometimes you only want three doughnuts.  Tomorrow<br/>\nhe&#39;ll eat other things.  Do you think he is going to starve himself? <br/>\nAnd he was right.  Today he is eating other things and yesterday he<br/>\nonly wanted 3 doughnuts.  And the coercion I attempted was<br/>\nshort-sighted and mean.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your priority is perfectly behaved children who read at an early<br/>\nage and who impress your friends and family with their knowledge and<br/>\ndeportment, you may find unschooling a hard path to follow (not that<br/>\nany other method will necessarily get you these things).  If your<br/>\npriority is to respect your children as people and to help them to<br/>\nexplore the world in an engaging way than it is also important to<br/>\nunderstand that as romantic as these things sound it is hard and on<br/>\nbad days it is easy to note that they only ate 3 doughnuts or that<br/>\nevery time you go to the store they have to buy something or that they<br/>\nare watching loads of television.  It all depends on your priorities.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; Since de-ruling, [older of two, a boy] has had periods of<br/>\nliterally 8, 10 <br/>\n&gt; hours a day of<br/>\n&gt; watching tv, animated cartoons almost exclusively. &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7090222,"authorName":"spcparents@aol.com","from":"spcparents@...","profile":"spcparents","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: more input on TV question, please","postDate":"1116391009","msgId":105970,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5MC40MDI3YmE1ZC4yZmJjMjA2MUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":105962,"nextInTopic":105971,"prevInTime":105969,"nextInTime":105971,"topicId":105948,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/17/2005 5:44:02 AM Central Daylight Time, UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com writes: Do you  have a good VCR or TIVO or a way to record","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1361820248\">In a message dated 5/17/2005 5:44:02 AM Central Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you  have a good VCR or TIVO or a way to record their favorite shows so <br/>\nthey  won&#39;t mind being gone?

(I <br/>\nhave 3 kids under 5, so I&#39;m seeing lots of joy in the theoretical idea <br/>\nof having a little time to oneself. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest not looking at how many months they may deschool for, <br/>\nor any other measure of how &quot;well&quot; they are unschooling. If you need to <br/>\nlook for progress--and that&#39;s a big if--look for it in yourself. With <br/>\ntv, you&#39;ve stopped turning it off, but still are wanting to control it. <br/>\nI did the same with food: said yes always to candy and they just kept <br/>\neating. Wondered if I really could have candy in the house without it <br/>\nall getting sucked down in a day. Finally I realized I&#39;d skipped a step-<br/>\n-despite having read about it 1000 times. I wasn&#39;t leaving the candy <br/>\nwhere they could reach it. I was getting it for them, but that involved <br/>\nsighing, offering them other foods or making them wait a minute til I <br/>\nfinished whatever I was doing, blah blah blah. Then they figured out <br/>\nthey could drag a chair over and get it themselves and within a week <br/>\nthey were eating less candy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s even better if you don&#39;t look anywhere for &quot;progress&quot; but try to <br/>\nlive in the moment and enjoy yourself.

When&#39;s the last time you went to <br/>\nthe children&#39;s museum, the zoo, miniature golf, a hike with a picnic?   Don&#39;t do <br/>\nthose things just to get the TV turned off, though.  Do them because they <br/>\nmake life richer and happier.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have a good VCR or TIVO or a way to record their favorite shows so <br/>\nthey won&#39;t mind being gone?    Maybe they have a genetically-gained need to <br/>\ncontrol, and the ability to record up some good stuff would keep them from wanting <br/>\nto watch as much as they could, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to take this to UnschoolingDiscussion (I won&#39;t use your names) and <br/>\nask for more comments.  They  might think I&#39;ve already covered it, or there <br/>\nmight be more discussion.
