They carry children, they carry<br/>\nhardships, they carry burdens, but they hold happiness, love, and joy. They<br/>\nsmile when they want to scream. They sing when they want to cry. They cry<br/>\nwhen they are happy and laugh when they are nervous. Women wait by the<br/>\nphone for a &quot;safe at home call&quot; from a friend after a snowy drive home.<br/>\nWomen have special qualities about them. They volunteer for good causes.<br/>\nThey are pink ladies in hospitals, they bring food to shut-ins. They are<br/>\nchild care workers, executives, attorneys, stay-at-home moms, biker babes,<br/>\nand your neighbors. They wear suits, jeans, and they wear uniforms. They<br/>\nfight for what they believe in. They stand up for injustice. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are in the front row at PTA meetings.  They vote for the person that<br/>\nwill do the best job for family issues. They<br/>\nwalk and talk the extra mile to get their children in the right schools and<br/>\nfor getting their family the right health care. They write to the editor,<br/>\ntheir congressmen and to the &quot;powers that be&quot; for things that make for a<br/>\nbetter life. They don&#39;t take &quot;no&quot; for an answer when they believe there is<br/>\na better solution.<br/>\n  <br/>\nThey stick a love note in the lover&#39;s lunch box. They do without new shoes<br/>\nso their children can have them. They go to the doctor with a frightened<br/>\nfriend.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey love unconditionally. Women are honest, loyal, and forgiving. They<br/>\nare smart, knowing that knowledge is power. But they still know how to use<br/>\ntheir softer side to make a point. Women want to be the best for their<br/>\nfamily, their friends, and themselves. They cry when their children excel<br/>\nand cheer when their friends get awards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are happy when they hear about a birth or a new marriage. Their hearts<br/>\nbreak when a friend dies. They have sorrow at the loss of a family member,<br/>\nyet are strong when they think there is no strength left. A women&#39;s touch<br/>\ncan cure any ailment. They know that a hug and a kiss can heal a broken<br/>\nheart. A woman can make a romantic evening unforgettable. Women come in all<br/>\nsizes, in all colors and shapes. They live in homes, apartments, and<br/>\ncabins. They drive, fly, walk, run, or e-mail you to show you how much they<br/>\ncare about you. The heart of a woman is what makes the world spin!<br/>\nWomen do more than just give birth. They bring joy and hope. They give<br/>\ncompassion and ideals. They give moral support to their family and friends.<br/>\nAnd all they want back is a hug, a smile, and for you to do the same to<br/>\npeople you come in contact with.<br/>\n<br/>\nMEN<br/>\n<br/>\nMen are good at lifting heavy stuff and killing bugs.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11101,"nextTopicId":11103}}
