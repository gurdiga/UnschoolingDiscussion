So here are some of my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-624896805\">I haven&#39;t responded to any of the posts about cleaning and clutter and all<br/>\nthat....but I have been reading and enjoying and thinking.<br/>\nSo here are some of my thoughts I&#39;ll share....<br/>\nI&#39;m not a great housekeeper...never have been. And I was raised doing all<br/>\nkinds of chores...I was raised by a single mom so my sister and I were<br/>\nexpected to help out, I learned to cook and clean...I love to cook, I hate<br/>\nto clean.  After we had kids, I tried things like assigned chores and chore<br/>\ncharts and schedules....and it never worked because I could never follow<br/>\nthem. I couldn&#39;t justify asking my kids to do what I couldn&#39;t do. So we have<br/>\nevolved into helping out as needed. When my kids were little, the oldest was<br/>\nalways messy and cluttered, the younger girl was neat and organized...by<br/>\nnature, not my doing!....Now as 18 and 15 year olds...there rooms are mostly<br/>\nspotless, organized and they do their own laundry.  I never &#39;made&#39; them<br/>\nclean their rooms, I only helped when they asked, they haven&#39;t had<br/>\nconsistent structure with chores and certainly not a very good example, and<br/>\nyet their rooms look just the way they want them (and usually cleaner than<br/>\nmy room!).  My boys share a room and it&#39;s less neat than the girls, but is<br/>\nthe way they like it for now. They clean it when they feel it needs it.  My<br/>\n15 year old hates a messy kitchen, so she is often the one that cleans it. I<br/>\ntry to keep it under control out of respect for her needs....but it doesn&#39;t<br/>\ntake much for it to get out of hand....my oldest usually keeps the bathroom<br/>\nclean, the boys help out as asked, they rarely mind and they can almost<br/>\nalways say no.....my house isn&#39;t spotless and I have been blessed (or<br/>\ncursed, depending on who you ask) with the ability to not see a lot of<br/>\nclutter and mess most of the time.  My poor dh was raised by a neat-nic,<br/>\nwhite couch, no toys in the living room kind of mom....he&#39;s adjusted pretty<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here are some of my thoughts on all this...I lost a parent and<br/>\ngrandparent to cancer as a young child. I have lived with knowing how short<br/>\nlife is....and how sudden things can change....I had other losses I won&#39;t go<br/>\ninto here....but I decided a long time ago that life is short and who cares<br/>\nwhat my house is like now.....when the kids were little, we had toys in the<br/>\nliving room. A lot of toys, most of their toys, because I wanted to be with<br/>\nmy kids, not send them to their rooms to play. A very strange concept to my<br/>\ndh. He liked the idea...mostly....but would sometimes complain after<br/>\ntripping over something or seeing yet again, piles of legos and blocks....I<br/>\nassured him that one day, the kids would be older and we wouldn&#39;t have toys<br/>\nin the living room....and you know what? That day is here. Not a single toy<br/>\nis in our living room.  Now we have kids here all the time...and they will<br/>\nalways be welcome because this time will pass as well. We drive the kids and<br/>\ntheir friends a lot.....and sometimes it&#39;s a pain and inconvenient, but this<br/>\ntime will pass. My husband is an artist in his spare time and uses found<br/>\nobjects for his art...he is always bringing home &#39;treasures&#39; and they often<br/>\nsit in the living room until there is time to put them in his studio....and<br/>\nI rarely complain, because...someday he could be gone....stuff is so trivial<br/>\ncompared to that.  I guess perspective and priorities.....mine are usually<br/>\ndifferent than most of the worlds....and I used to think I was the one that<br/>\nwas wrong.  And none of this means that there aren&#39;t days when I wish the<br/>\nhouse was clean, really clean or that we had nicer things (less kid<br/>\nfriendly) or whatever. But when the kids were little, I used to have days<br/>\nwhere I wished for a bit more personal space, or a full night&#39;s sleep or<br/>\nwhatever and the day has come, as I knew it would.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the lighter side, my husband does occasionally comment that the day will<br/>\ncome when we are empty nesters (which we are not in a hurry for, but it will<br/>\ncome) and then the house will be clean and picked up on a consistent<br/>\nbasis....Poor man is in for such a shock...I just don&#39;t think I have that in<br/>\nme....kids or no kids! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-18, Lisa-15, Karl-13, & Ben-9. <br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Group, an inclusive group meeting throughout Oakland<br/>\nCounty.. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingonashoestring.com/REACH_home.html\">http://www.homeschoolingonashoestring.com/REACH_home.html</a><br/>\n*Michigan Youth Theater...Acting On Our Dreams...<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.michiganyouththeater.org/\">http://www.michiganyouththeater.org/</a>&gt;<br/>\n&quot;Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it.&quot; ~~ Dennis P.<br/>\nKimbro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99490,"nextTopicId":99621}}
