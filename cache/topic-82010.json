In one situation, the family travels<br/>\ntogether in their own rig.  They love it primarily because they are at a<br/>\nstage that they can be a bit more picky about where and when they haul.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another situation, the mom stayed home most of the time and the kids took<br/>\nturns taking off on adventures with dad.  The boys are now grown and own<br/>\ntheir own trucking company and are all quite close.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh travels a lot and it varies as to how the kids handle it.  The main<br/>\nvariable tends to be how I&#39;m handling it.  We have 5 kids with lots of<br/>\ninterests and sometimes I just get plain worn out when dh is gone.  I find<br/>\nthat my sleep is a major factor in how the kids handle Dad being away.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81990,"nextTopicId":82013}}
