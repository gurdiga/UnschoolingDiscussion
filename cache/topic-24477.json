But it is so not what the Bible teaches.  In fact, men<br/>\nare told to honor and submit to their wives in scripture.  And men are<br/>\nsupposed to love their wives and treat them with the same care as they<br/>\ntreat their own bodies.  A lot of the references to women relate to the<br/>\nculture they were in more than to universal commands.  Scripture clearly<br/>\nteaches that Christian wives are fellow heirs with their husbands.  Men<br/>\nwho require obedience to the point of abuse are not full of the Holy<br/>\nSpirit, but of a demonic spirit.  Jesus said whoever wishes to lead must<br/>\nserve everyone.  Authority&#39;s purpose is to protect, not control. <br/>\nScripture teaches to respect the law of the land in the sense of being<br/>\nsubmitted to authority, yet in many places just being a believer is<br/>\nbreaking the law.  So submission is more an attitude of listening and<br/>\nhonoring and considering another&#39;s opinion than slave-like obedience out<br/>\nof fear.   And the Bible teaches we are a house for God to live in, and<br/>\nwe must treat that house with honor.  Unfortunately, many scriptures have<br/>\nfor centuries been taken out of their cultural and written context to<br/>\nwield as a club to keep women under a male&#39;s control.<br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Dawn","from":"&quot;Dawn&quot; &lt;NumoAstro@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"fPV6z7DkFGOcnoh7nsWQkjfoF-trzq_nBA0zJVGGI3LReVS7-FZvS-79gsPO4ielr26YzAQIRBCINxbn-ZcCgkA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Opinions and PC","postDate":"999961049","msgId":24573,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDluZGJrcCtuN2x1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTA4LjA5NTQ1Mi4tNzYwNTEzLjcucnVtcGxldGVhc2VybW9tQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24570,"nextInTopic":24601,"prevInTime":24572,"nextInTime":24574,"topicId":24477,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... do the ...
