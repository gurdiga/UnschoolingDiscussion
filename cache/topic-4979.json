Some people hate Wal-Mart - some  <br/>\n&gt; think the super center would bring business to town.  The problem is <br/>\n&gt; that when you live in a town this size,  options are limited.

I don&#39;t care for Wal-Mart either.  In fact,  right now <br/>\nthey&#39;re suing our town because their proposal for a super-center was <br/>\nturned down.  Wal-Mart says that the city commision&#39;s interpretation <br/>\nof zoning was incorrect and so the denial was illegal.  This issue <br/>\nhas really divided our town.  Some people hate Wal-Mart - some  <br/>\nthink the super center would bring business to town.  The problem is <br/>\nthat when you live in a town this size,  options are limited.  We <br/>\nhave a Wal-Mart,  a K-Mart and a mall with downsized versions of <br/>\nPenney&#39;s, Sears,  and Dillard - no Gap or Old Navy.   I don&#39;t have to think too hard to <br/>\nremember controversies with Sears over bait and switch and Dillards <br/>\nover their treatment of African Americans.  So.......where do we <br/>\nshop?  Our last locally owned dept. store closed years ago and our <br/>\nlocally owned grocery store was recently bought out by Kroger.<br/>\nThe few Mom and Pop stores in town are gift shops and the like.<br/>\nOur family actually does a lot of mail order,  but I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nthat&#39;s any better.  I notice that many of the clothes are made in <br/>\ncountries known to encourage sweatshops.  We&#39;ve simplified a lot and <br/>\ndon&#39;t enjoy shopping,  but there are still times when we have to.  <br/>\nSo.........where do you all shop?<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane in KS</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5036,"nextTopicId":5029}}
