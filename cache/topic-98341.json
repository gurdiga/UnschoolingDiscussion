In fact, as I read your initial post I was thinking that you seemed relaxed about the financial side of this issue in that it didn&#39;t seem to come up for you.  I can easily imagine my own children taking advantage of your generosity.  They are always curious to know what food other people eat and are quick to accept most anything offered, especially if it&#39;s a treat to them.  The difference though, is that I wouldn&#39;t restrict them from accepting (though I would expect them to exhibit good manners and not forage through your refrigerator uninvited!).<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve been wondering whether you might consider sitting down with Renee and Jonah&#39;s mother (without the kids present) and telling her that you no longer feel comfortable enforcing her restrictions when the kids are in your home without her.  You could just tell her honestly but gently that you don&#39;t believe in restricting kids in this way and how it makes you feel to have to do so.  I wonder how Jayn perceives all of this?  You could let the mother know that you want to set an example for Jayn that follows your own values and beliefs.  I don&#39;t see where you have much to lose.  At worst, she may no longer allow the kids in your home and that doesn&#39;t sound like such a horrible outcome.<br/>\n <br/>\nGlad you posted this.

(We each pick out a flavor at the grocery store.)<br/>\nDd2 and I eat ice-cream *every* night.  It&#39;s my favorite food.  When dh is<br/>\nhome, he eats it every night too.  Dd1 eats it once in a while.  She just<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like sweets as much as the rest of us.  (But although we eat it<br/>\nevery day, we only eat a small cone&#39;s worth, most of the time and no one<br/>\nwants more.)<br/>\n <br/>\nI absolutely never worry about what foods dd1 eats.  (Today she had<br/>\nblueberries and a cookie and milk for breakfast.) She eats way more<br/>\nnutritious foods than sweets overall.  That&#39;s just her preference.<br/>\nOccasionally I do worry about dd2.  Sometimes it seems like she could<br/>\nhappily live on sweets.  More often than not her choices do balance out<br/>\npretty well, but when she is on a kick of eating mostly sweets, which she&#39;ll<br/>\ndo sometimes for a couple or three days in a row, I do worry.  I always<br/>\noffer healthy stuff that she likes but she just likes sweets a lot.  <br/>\n <br/>\nDespite the fact that dd2 has had more sweets available to her in her life<br/>\nand has not had restrictions placed on them, she still eats more sweets than<br/>\nI am comfortable with at times.  I still would never control what she eats.<br/>\nI do sometimes remind her that she hasn&#39;t had anything nutritious for a<br/>\nwhile and she will often (not always) ask me to make her something<br/>\nnutritious before she eats more sweets.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy point was that different people have different preference and even if<br/>\nsweets are not restricted it won&#39;t always turn out that a person doesn&#39;t<br/>\neach much of that food.  I have one who is like Holly and I have to throw<br/>\nout her Halloween candy after many months and another who eats all her<br/>\nHalloween candy in a week or so and wished she had more.<br/>\n <br/>\nI grew up in a house where home-made sweets were always available.

It&#39;s a neediness that&#39;s not natural or normal at our house.<br/>\nMostly it makes me mad. I&#39;m mad at the parents (for putting *me* through<br/>\nthis, not to mention their kids), at the kids (for being so whiney and<br/>\nneedy), and at myself (for even getting angry). :-P~~~~* &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have nailed it! This resentment is exactly what I am feeling and why.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I have to say that dh and I also just don&#39;t take to Renee, although<br/>\nwe both like Jonah. I have to work hard at just being neutral and pleasant<br/>\nto her, and actively seek out pleasant thoughts to have about her when she<br/>\nis here. For example she always courteously takes her wrapper or empty<br/>\ncontainer to the trash can. I don&#39;t like disliking a child so thoroughly - I<br/>\nfeel a bit guilty about it. <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;My take on this is maybe so &quot;out there&quot;---but *I* think it&#39;s due the<br/>\nforced  &quot;sharing&quot; that goes on with close-in-age siblings or with unrelated<br/>\nsame-age children (like in day cares). Forcing a small child (and even a<br/>\nbigger one when  he&#39;s not ready) to share seems to ensure that the child<br/>\nWILL have trouble sharing.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have read this before, but have no personal experience of it. Only<br/>\npersonal experience of witnessing the misery of children being made to give<br/>\nup their special toy and threatened with Time-Out when they protested. (Not<br/>\na prevalent attitude amongst my local home schoolers - just ordinary parents<br/>\nat the park.) What I do know from our experience is that if children are not<br/>\nrequired to share unwillingly, they eventually share perfectly willingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never forced Jayn to share, and we also put up any special toys or<br/>\nDVD&#39;s she is unwilling to have other kids use. <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;My guess is that she&#39;s been told this over and over and over and MADE to  <br/>\nshare even when she doesn&#39;t want to.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you are correct. Renee&#39;s definition of sharing here is &quot;You give<br/>\nthat to me&quot;. <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;My recent solution is to just put everything up while they&#39;re here. No<br/>\nM&M&#39;s in the bowl, no just-baked brownies, no sodas in the &#39;frig&quot;----NOTHING<br/>\ncool. I still offer Monkey Platters in the afternoon, which they eat<br/>\nhappily, but I&#39;m just not comfortable with the &quot;eating me out of house and<br/>\nsugar&quot; that goes on when I keep the &quot;sweets&quot; out.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRenee and Jonah&#39;s arrivals are often spontaneous. Also my kitchen is tiny,<br/>\nand I have no pantry to stash stuff in. But I like the concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Some of you may just be such better Samaritans &lt;g&gt; , but I HATE the<br/>\nwhining and begging and snooping for stuff here.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSnooping - yes, yes. I have been trying to rationalize away my discomfort at<br/>\nJonah just going to my fridge to help himself to food, and ask what things<br/>\nare in there. I don&#39;t know if he does this at home - I mean the self serving<br/>\npart. Is it wrong to ask him to ask first, or to let me get it for him? I<br/>\nhave been telling myself that it is because he is relaxed here, but kept<br/>\nwishing he weren&#39;t so. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been engaging in a campaign to keep visiting kids out of our (only)<br/>\nbedroom - I really want some private space. To be honest I usually feel<br/>\nuncomfortable when visiting other people&#39;s homes when they treat their own<br/>\nadult&#39;s bedroom as if it were public space for playing/conversing in. It<br/>\nmakes me feel weirdly like a snooper, even though I am not.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I was better/calmer/more generous with Cameron&#39;s friends----but they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t (couldn&#39;t, with school) spend as much time here as all these<br/>\nhomeschoolers---sometimes days on end.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to have breaks between days, and often so does Jayn, and I try to<br/>\nkeep the visits shorter - like a couple of hours. I actually get pretty worn<br/>\nand stressed with almost all the play-dates Jayn has had recently - but it<br/>\nis sometimes the parents rather than the child. It seems like the kid/parent<br/>\ncombinations which increase my serenity and who I would like to see more of<br/>\nare less available for play-dates than the ones that leave me feeling like a<br/>\nlimp rag who are always wanting to come over.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Well, the wise Mama bought a<br/>\nCostco-like huge,triple supply of ketchup and served nothing but ketchup<br/>\nover several meals for a couple of days.  Ketchup soup, Toast with ketchup,<br/>\nketchup sundaes, etc...  At first the children were thrilled, but of course,<br/>\nthey eventually wanted to eat something else and had had their fill of<br/>\nketchup for a while.  My kids thought this was pretty funny and liked the<br/>\nway it was all handled, especially since they love ketchup too.

I was thinking as I was<br/>\nreading the posts on this thread that I worry about the restrictions placed<br/>\non my kids because of our financial situation more than I do about giving<br/>\nanyone too much.  My kids have plenty to eat but we really have to carefully<br/>\nbalance their wants with everyone&#39;s needs.   I do buy ice cream every week,<br/>\nbut the amount depends on how good the sales are and it often doesn&#39;t last<br/>\nbeyond a few days. I also can&#39;t be as generous with their friends as I would<br/>\nlike.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFamily budget is a *real life* reason for certain restrictions, plus the<br/>\nwhole family gets to share in the &quot;deprivation&quot; (g). It is not something<br/>\nonly the children necessarily have to live with, because the parents are<br/>\nbeing controlling for whatever untrusting or &quot;teaching a life-lesson&quot;<br/>\nreason. <br/>\n<br/>\nI did not intend to imply that I had a problem with the amount of food my<br/>\nvisitors were consuming from a financial aspect. As it happens they don&#39;t<br/>\ncome here that often for many reasons, some of which I have talked about in<br/>\nthe past, so it is not like a constant drain on my resources. Nor is it<br/>\nmeals, but snacks. If we have run out of something that they would like, oh<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn may have whatever she wants to eat (from the food in the house or the<br/>\nmenu at the restaurant) at any time that she wants it. I want to give the<br/>\nchildren who visit here the benefit of being treated like rational people. I<br/>\nusually ask visiting kids if they are allowed some food, and then I take<br/>\ntheir word for it. I still tend to speak to the kids if the parents are in<br/>\nthe house too, and let the kids go do the asking for permission if they need<br/>\nto. Most of the time when it is little folk Jayn&#39;s age, the Moms bring their<br/>\nown snacks along as well, but there is nothing like someone else&#39;s snack<br/>\nahead of your own. (g)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of Renee, there seems to be a history of less than truthfulness<br/>\nand other motivations for wanting foods than peckishness. I&#39;m envisioning<br/>\n(negatively predictive) a scenario where her mother discovers she has been<br/>\neating something that I have given her, and that Mom won&#39;t *blame* me, but<br/>\n*will* punish and/or be unkind to Renee. My first strategy is to offer foods<br/>\nthat are surely unremarkable, like apples or sandwiches. It&#39;s better when<br/>\njust one of them is here, and we try to keep it that way more often than<br/>\nnot.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

We don&#39;t.  We try and make sure that ds eats a balance of healthy foods but don&#39;t try and pressure him.  Just suggest &quot;if you eat candy without protein or other good foods, you might now feel as well, how about this or that first&quot;.  We are candy crazy, all of us and we have lots of it at our house.  Most of our visitors eat only organic and almost never let their kids eat candy or even potato chips.  Same with the media issue.  I&#39;ve had them drop them off for me to baby sit (for FREE) and tell me &quot;please don&#39;t let them watch tv, they watch their 30 minutes already. And, no sweets, she had her sweets for the week.&quot;  Ugh!  It drives me crazy.  And these kids are starting to constantly beg, sneak and lie about things.  Then, they say, &quot;does ds lie or sneak stuff?&quot;  no.  We have lots of candy out.  He asks first, and if we aren&#39;t about to eat dinner, then it&#39;s usually fine.  They think we eat way too much candy and watch way too much tv.  I&#39;m glad to find a group that backs up our theory.  <br/>\nLaura J<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164542605,"authorName":"Danielle Conger","from":"Danielle Conger &lt;danielle.conger@...&gt;","profile":"danielleconger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Visitor&#39;s food restrictions (long)","postDate":"1092857064","msgId":98357,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxMjNBQ0U4LjMwMDAwMDBAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGNlLjU1MmU5YmFmLjJlNTRlNWI5QGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGNlLjU1MmU5YmFmLjJlNTRlNWI5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":98355,"nextInTopic":98362,"prevInTime":98356,"nextInTime":98358,"topicId":98341,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kelly wrote: My take on this is maybe so out there ---but *I* think it s due the forced sharing that goes on with close-in-age siblings or with unrelated ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2025937971\">&lt;&gt;Kelly wrote: My take on this is maybe so &quot;out there&quot;---but *I* think <br/>\nit&#39;s due the forced<br/>\n&quot;sharing&quot; that goes on with close-in-age siblings or with unrelated <br/>\nsame-age<br/>\nchildren (like in day cares). Forcing a small child (and even a bigger one<br/>\nwhen he&#39;s not ready) to share seems to ensure that the child WILL have <br/>\ntrouble<br/>\nsharing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy wrote: And I think forced sharing at an early age would have made <br/>\nhim less likely to share.<br/>\n=========<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that folks are saying the above is an absolute--merely to throw in <br/>\nmy experience with this and point out that a household with several <br/>\nyoung children needs to have some sharing strategies in place. <br/>\nNegotiating sharing with multiple, close-in-age siblings is not easy! <br/>\nMine all seem to have different capacities to share based on their own <br/>\ntemperament and birth order more than anything, I think. My oldest, <br/>\nEmily (7), is extremely generous and empathetic, always trying to give <br/>\nher money or special toys to friends and family, though she&#39;s also quick <br/>\nto snag the last cookie for herself. My middle child, Julia (5), is <br/>\ngenerous to a fault, always giving away anything to keep the peace and <br/>\nmake her siblings happy, and a bigtime caretaker, always running to grab <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s special and an icepack or a bandaid if they&#39;re hurt. My <br/>\nyoungest, Sam (4), is becoming much more generous as he gets older and <br/>\nis becoming quite adept at sharing and asking for turns--not so quick to <br/>\npitch in and help, but that&#39;ll come in time, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are all close in age--fewer than 17 months apart. We&#39;ve always <br/>\nhad lots of group toys given as group gifts for holidays, which <br/>\neliminates much of the &quot;ownership&quot; issues, and we also have several <br/>\n&quot;specials,&quot; which are things they don&#39;t have to share like blankets and <br/>\nfavorite birthday/ new toys. Each birthday they each choose one <br/>\n&quot;special&quot; gift that they don&#39;t have to share, and then share the rest. <br/>\nWe also live by the principle &quot;If there&#39;s more than one, then it&#39;s your <br/>\nresponsibility to share&quot;--meaning one person can&#39;t hog all the cookies, <br/>\nall the blocks, all the whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s very difficult to negotiate life with several small children <br/>\nwithout some kind of set-up for sharing or rotating, and it&#39;s also <br/>\ndifficult to strike a balance between respect for the person&#39;s turn and <br/>\nrespect for the person&#39;s age-ability to wait. To small children 5 <br/>\nminutes can seem like a lifetime! In our house, we&#39;ve used the above <br/>\nguidelines and principles; we also tend to have duplicates of lots of <br/>\nthings, especially the really popular items. We&#39;re lucky enough to have <br/>\n4 computers for 5 people--2 adult laptops, which we&#39;ll occasionally <br/>\nshare ;), and two kid computers. I know Sandra&#39;s talked about having <br/>\n&quot;days&quot; at her house where they rotate turns to call front seat, etc. <br/>\nThere are probably as many strategies as their are families! My point is <br/>\nthat I think larger families need some strategies in place, somewhere in <br/>\nbetween &quot;share now!&quot; and &quot;you can keep that as long as you want.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Visitor&#39;s food restrictions (long)","postDate":"1092854802","msgId":98355,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxMjNBNDEyLjIwMTA2MDdAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGNlLjU1MmU5YmFmLjJlNTRlNWI5QGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGNlLjU1MmU5YmFmLjJlNTRlNWI5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":98352,"nextInTopic":98357,"prevInTime":98354,"nextInTime":98356,"topicId":98341,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** Our German neighbor (17 at the time) would inSIST that Cameron share.

My sister has a <br/>\nlovely house with a beautiful back yard - sand box, playscape, well <br/>\ngroomed lawn, vinyl-type deck (not wood). Lovely. That&#39;s where most <br/>\nfamily gatherings occur - space for grown ups to chat, kids to play, <br/>\ncool.

Forcing a small child (and even a bigger one <br/>\nwhen  he&#39;s not ready) to share seems to ensure that the child WILL have trouble  <br/>\nsharing.<br/>\n <br/>\nOur German neighbor (17 at the time) would inSIST that Cameron share. He  was <br/>\nTWO! I&#39;d insist that he didn&#39;t have to share if he didn&#39;t want to. She  <br/>\nannounced that, with no siblings, he would surely be a selfish child if I didn&#39;t  <br/>\nstart making him share *now*. This was pre-unschooling----by about  10-11 <br/>\nyears. I responded that he would be ready to share when he was  ready to share; two <br/>\nyear olds aren&#39;t *meant* to share. She just shook her head. <br/>\n <br/>\nCameron is incredibly generous with his time and money and things. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;ll be interesting to hear how she handles things with her new baby in  <br/>\nOctober. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Renee had the effrontery to tell my dh that he “could  share” his <br/>\nspecial<br/>\nItalian sodas, even when there was a multitude of other  cold juice and pop<br/>\nchoices available and offered. Jayn and I don’t even  snake his special sodas<br/>\nfrom him – not *very* often. She kept saying “why”  after being told “no,<br/>\nthose are James’ sodas” probably four or five times.  REALLY tiresome.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nMy guess is that she&#39;s been told this over and over and over and MADE to  <br/>\nshare even when she doesn&#39;t want to. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy recent solution is to just put everything up while they&#39;re here.
