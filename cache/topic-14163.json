Boob-Lift = The unconscious lifting of ones<br/>\n&gt; breasts to check which<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt;  fuller. May be done at any time  regardless of<br/>\n&gt; where you are or whom<br/>\n&gt;  you&#39;re talking to, grocery sackers and priests not<br/>\n&gt; withstanding.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  2. Nursing Flip = The action of adjusting you and<br/>\n&gt; your baby to make<br/>\n&gt;  ready for nursing. This means moving your tee-shirt<br/>\n&gt; off your butt,<br/>\n&gt; doing<br/>\n&gt;  the &quot;boob-lift&quot;, putting the baby in the crook of<br/>\n&gt; your arm and<br/>\n&gt;  unlatching your bra, all in about 15 seconds with<br/>\n&gt; no attention taken<br/>\n&gt;  away from your previous task.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  3. Wet-Nurse Syndrome = The unconscious urge to<br/>\n&gt; nurse any fussy baby<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt;  happen to be holding: You may be engaged in casual<br/>\n&gt; conversation while<br/>\n&gt;  holding your neighbor&#39;s baby, she fusses and you do<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;nursing flip&quot;,<br/>\n&gt;  your neighbor looks at you shocked &quot;oh my, she must<br/>\n&gt; be hungry&quot; you<br/>\n&gt;  mumble as you pass her infant back.   *A<br/>\n&gt; side-effect of this is the<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;breastmilk fixes everything&quot; philosophy. You may<br/>\n&gt; find yourself using<br/>\n&gt;  breastmilk for your family&#39;s various wounds: &quot;got a<br/>\n&gt; sore, earache or<br/>\n&gt;  zit? Put some breastmilk on it, that&#39;ll fix it&quot;<br/>\n&gt; (least that&#39;s what they<br/>\n&gt;  say, can&#39;t hurt)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  4. Tittie Wrangling = The acrobatics your toddler<br/>\n&gt; does while nursing,<br/>\n&gt;  including but not limited to flips, headstands, &<br/>\n&gt; taffy-pulls, all<br/>\n&gt; while<br/>\n&gt;  surrounded by relatives who believe that baby<br/>\n&gt; should have been weaned<br/>\n&gt;  months ago. The benefit of this exercise is that<br/>\n&gt; you can now nurse your<br/>\n&gt;  kid while each of you lie on you backs,<br/>\n&gt; side-by-side.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  5. Twiddling = What happens if everyone fails to<br/>\n&gt; mention that your baby<br/>\n&gt;  caressing your other breast while nursing is NOT<br/>\n&gt; sweet. Never, never<br/>\n&gt; let<br/>\n&gt;  your baby know that you can possibly have two<br/>\n&gt; breasts at the same time.<br/>\n&gt;  Always keep the unused breast covered lest you want<br/>\n&gt; your little<br/>\n&gt; nursling<br/>\n&gt;  to use it as her favorite toy. This becomes a habit<br/>\n&gt; quick, heed our<br/>\n&gt;  warning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  6. The Steal = The act of removing your nipple from<br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt;  already-sleeping baby&#39;s mouth so that you may roll<br/>\n&gt; over or sneak out of<br/>\n&gt;  bed for some midnight internet use. Typically takes<br/>\n&gt; 2 or 3 tries to<br/>\n&gt;  succeeded.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  7. Just a Sip = When your now-walking baby comes to<br/>\n&gt; you, lifts your<br/>\n&gt;  shirt and grabs a drink to refuel him/her for 10<br/>\n&gt; more minutes of play.<br/>\n&gt;  This helping themselves is a show of independence<br/>\n&gt; for them and a show<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt;  breast for everyone else in the room.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  8. Car Surfing = what you are doing when you<br/>\n&gt; strategically hover your<br/>\n&gt;  breast over the baby&#39;s car seat while daddy drives<br/>\n&gt; down the interstate<br/>\n&gt;  ignoring your butt in the rearview mirror.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  9. *Ecstasy Eyes* = Picture this, baby is screaming<br/>\n&gt; at your feet while<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt;  are talking on the phone, cooking dinner and<br/>\n&gt; getting a band-aid for<br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt;  toddler. You finally sit and pick up the baby to<br/>\n&gt; nurse and she goes<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt;  screaming to rolling her eyes to the back of her<br/>\n&gt; head in ecstasy in<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt;  a few seconds.  (Don&#39;t you just love it?)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  10. Kneading = the act of damn near maiming your<br/>\n&gt; breast tissue while<br/>\n&gt;  your adorable (and sharp nailed) little one nurses.<br/>\n&gt; This can result in<br/>\n&gt;  your breast looking like you&#39;ve just nursed a baby<br/>\n&gt; kitten.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
