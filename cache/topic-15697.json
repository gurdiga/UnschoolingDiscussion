I heard once that a Native American tribe had 6 words for<br/>\ngender, compared to our 2 (male & female).  However, we will probably<br/>\nnever determine how much of male vs female is nature vs nurture, because<br/>\nstudies have shown that it is common for people to treat boys and girls<br/>\ndifferently from birth, and even in the womb.  So any study of children<br/>\nthat proves inherent differences will be flawed, because those children<br/>\nwill have already been affected by nurture.  Even if you treat your boy<br/>\nand girl identically, others whom they interact with will not.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nGain weight... Stay Active...
