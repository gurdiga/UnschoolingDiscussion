I always hesitate to \ntell it, thinking that it may come across as bragging. Yes, I am very proud of \nher and how she&#39;s doing (and I *do* brag%-/ ).&nbsp; What spurs me on to risk \nthe bragging&nbsp;label is that I do believe there&#39;s a place for tv. If a parent \nleaves it up to the kids to decide what to watch, as I did, THEN SITS WITH THE \nKIDS TO WATCH IT (very important), the kids seem to govern themselves over \nwhat&#39;s right and wrong. And, if they choose a &quot;wrong&quot; show to watch, it&#39;s a \ngreat time to nit-pick the show to death, pointing out all it&#39;s flaws.( &quot; gosh, \ndid you all see how&nbsp;that actress was dressed and how that, alone, affected \nhow those officials treated her?!&nbsp; Is that&nbsp;right/just? And whether or \nnot it is, why&nbsp;would she choose to dress like that? What could she do to \ngive a different impression?&quot;..&nbsp; that kind of stuff) After approaching the \ntv monster in this manner, I have had no problems with the girls choosing &#39;bad&#39; \nstuff to watch. They see through it and it&#39;s not something mystical and \nwonderful anymore.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Abadi MT Condensed Light\">..off my little soapbox.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Abadi MT Condensed Light\">Sarah :-)</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div></font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcauley@...\" title=\"kbcauley@...\">Kathryn B \n  Cauley</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\"\n title=\"Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Thursday, November 02, 2000 11:48 \n  PM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] The \n  Parent&#39;s Essential Active Role in Unschooling</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>Sarah-the story of your daughter T.V./edu. was very \n  insightful and<br>helpful.<br>Thanks- it was a good \nread!<br>Kathy<br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Kathryn B Cauley","from":"Kathryn B Cauley &lt;kbcauley@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"8svSKqjOGYa-ITFViWvxlylVVhKIKMuQhYzcjxSIzGyt59aD6DgRUzv80pVmNzFvZbu2U2FN_Oc2RqVnHirmGG2KQ-e2Nl7IzlXv","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] The Parent&#39;s Essential Active Role in Unschooling","postDate":"973226920","msgId":13946,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAxMDI5LjExNDA1OS40NTU5LjMua2JjYXVsZXlAanVuby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PEY4MVByUHJ2Q1dPNmhtOFVhOGQwMDAwNGY2M0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDAwMzcwMWMwNDI4YSRmMGRjZGJlMCQ0YmJjMGUwY0ByYWxleT4gPDAwNDQwMWMwNDI5NiRlZThiMmQ0MCQ5MDA2YTMxOEB0cmlhZC5yci5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":13914,"nextInTopic":13953,"prevInTime":13945,"nextInTime":13947,"topicId":13821,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sarah-the story of your daughter T.V./edu. was very insightful and helpful.

Let me just say that I took my daughter out of school last December, we started","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-947725125\">Hi Everyone,<br/>\nI have been reading all the posts on active rolls on unschooling. Let me just <br/>\nsay that I took my daughter out of school last December, we started off with <br/>\nschool at home. That was a nightmare!! My daughter goes in two directions <br/>\neither she catches on real fast and then gets bored  to death or she has a <br/>\nhard time and gets really frustrated and starts with the poor me , Im so <br/>\ndumb, or Im stupid. The latter part of it really bothers me. So began the <br/>\nunschooling journey, I have read and reread all the books I can get my hands <br/>\non (lucky for me I love to read.) Any way it was very hard for me to see the <br/>\nbig picture and still is , we started officially unschooling in April of last <br/>\nyear and all seemed well in the beginning ..After reading the books again and <br/>\nreading the posts on the list , I felt confident to go with it. I have spent <br/>\nthe last 6 months watching my daughter sit in front of the t.v. or play <br/>\ngameboy(Im with the mother who said she would like to throw gameboy out the <br/>\nwindow)some days she does nothing but eat all day. Let me just say I think at <br/>\nthis point I have very little tongue left as I have bitten right off trying <br/>\nto keep my nagging mouth shut. Everyone says this is the de-schooling stage <br/>\nand I should let her be. So I have. I have spent many sleepless nights <br/>\nwondering if what I feel in my heart could truely be what is right in my <br/>\nhead. I love the idea of unschooling but the schoolish part of me needs to <br/>\nsee results. We are required by law in NH to test once a year. We did that in <br/>\nJuly with the PASS Test from Hewitt Resources. I JUST recieved the results <br/>\nFriday. She did really good. 90th% on the nationals  ( with no help from me <br/>\nother than organizing the pages) <br/>\nI am so sorry to go on but this week has been very difficult for me. Before <br/>\nwe started unschooling my daughter loved to read , draw, make concoctions in <br/>\nthe kitchen. (which I hated) Now when she says shes bored and I suggest she <br/>\nread one of the million books I have bought for her, she replies with &quot;Mom , <br/>\nI dont want to do school work.&quot;  when the &quot;school&quot; year started this sept. I <br/>\nthought I would be prepared for ALL the great things that would happen so I <br/>\nordered all kinds of books  like Cartooning for beginners and Easy drawing <br/>\nlessons  and How to draw animals. She has not touched them. I bought  The Big <br/>\nBook of How. and other reference materials , nothing specific , just stuff <br/>\nthat she could use if she had a motivation. I DID NOT push them on her , just <br/>\nlet her know they were there if she wanted them. I have mentioned music <br/>\nlessons and theater(shes a Drama Qween)  She takes Riding lessons  and loves <br/>\nthat but shows no interest in the two horses that we own. She is an only <br/>\nchild and is lonely sometimes but when I bring up a support group (we even <br/>\nwent to one) she shrugs it off. When I suggested 4-H  she had no interest. Or <br/>\nshe replies with &quot;Mom , that is so queer&quot; Truthfully at this point I am at a <br/>\ncomplete loss .Now I am having a problem with family members. I had mentioned <br/>\nto my sister that Kearstins test results came in and she did really good on <br/>\nthem. She said that was great. But while we are on the subject I wanted to <br/>\ntalk to you about this homeschooling thing. (None of my family members <br/>\nsupports me on this , except my wonderful husband.) So of course I was a <br/>\nlittle on gaurd. She said that my family had a &quot; Family Discussion&quot; about me <br/>\nand that they felt that homeschooling was not in &quot;The Best Interest of <br/>\nKearstin&quot; as there is no  structure and every kid needs stucture!!! I was <br/>\nlivid at first . My reaction was who the hell are you to discuss my family <br/>\nand who do you think you are telling me that I might unknowingly hurt my <br/>\nchild . My poor sister was elected by the family to have this talk with me <br/>\nbecause she is the most likely to be open and compassionate.??? She said that <br/>\nis was discussed that maybe someone should make a phone call to child <br/>\nservices so that I would comply with my familys wishes and send my daughter <br/>\nback to school where she will recieve stucture!!!  You will be happy to know <br/>\nthat I did not lose control.,...... or my temper I did not even raise my <br/>\nvoice. I talked it out with my sister I put myself in there shoes and thought <br/>\nhow I could explain my views and hopes. She felt aweful and asked me if I was <br/>\nmad at her. I said no Im not mad. I am hurt and disappointed that nobody <br/>\ncalled me to ask me in the first place . That if they were so concerned they <br/>\nwould have gone to the bookstore and read up on homeschooling and unschooling <br/>\nand tryed to see where I was coming from. That really it was none of their <br/>\nbusiness how I bring up my daughter, but because they said they were <br/>\nconcerned I would try to help them understand.  I asked my sister that if I <br/>\nbrought her some books , would she read them and try to at least get an idea <br/>\nof unschooling. Then at least even if she dosnt agree she will know why she <br/>\ndosnt agree. I told her I wouldnt change my mind about unschooling because I <br/>\nbelieve in my heart that its the right thing to do. But that I would keep the <br/>\nfamily updated on her progress. (as soon as I figure that one out.) <br/>\nSo I left there feeling very unsure of myself and found myself questioning <br/>\nyet again if I really knew what I was  doing. I talked with my husband ( who <br/>\njust about went through the roof when I told him of the family discussion) <br/>\nBut he assured me that we were doing fine and we should keep waiting for <br/>\nKearstin to show signs of Motivation. If any kind soul would like to send out <br/>\nsome advice or reassurences. I would be most grateful as I turn to the lists <br/>\nfor my support.  Thank you all for reading this very long post.<br/>\n<br/>\nTamie<br/>\nUnsure of herself at the moment.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"John O. Andersen","from":"&quot;John O.

He doesn&#39;t homeschool with us. He <br/>\nis a public school student and he is accustomed to having his entire day <br/>\nplanned for him. He is used to people telling him what to learn and how to <br/>\nlearn it. When he has free time he gravitates to the television and video <br/>\ngames. While I have seen a lot of good programming, I have seen that he does <br/>\n*not* get tired of television and turn it off. He will watch day in and day <br/>\nout, all day if no one tells him to turn it off. Sounds like your son still <br/>\nhas that institutional mentality and needs a chance to deschool some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that helped me discover some of Trenton&#39;s interests was to watch TV <br/>\nwith him. I found that he almost always watched certain kinds of shows. Wild <br/>\nanimals, extreme sports, the world&#39;s strangest people - shows about those <br/>\nthings appealed to him. I&#39;ve tried to get him books about those subjects and <br/>\nsend him websites that deal with those things. I also take him to lectures <br/>\nabout local wildlife and on hikes to try to spot some of the creatures he <br/>\nsees on tv. I do restrict the tv and videos because he is really not an <br/>\nindependent enough thinker right now to make that decision for himself. <br/>\nBesides, the constant babbling from the set really irritates me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d suggest continuing to be patient and doing what you think is best in <br/>\nterms of the electronics. You know your son best. Just don&#39;t expect him to <br/>\nchange from a school mentality to an unschooling mentality overnight. Isn&#39;t <br/>\nthe rule of thumb for deschooling something like a month for every year <br/>\nthey&#39;ve spent in school? (That doesn&#39;t include summer vacation.)

I&#39;ve been \nfollowing this thread and although I&#39;ve been lurking only a short while, I&#39;ve \nbeen&nbsp; homeschooling two daughters a long time. My experience has been quite \ndifferent from some of those mentioned and I feel compelled to expose a \ndifferent perspective.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Abadi MT Condensed Light\">We spent six months de-schooling our \noldest&nbsp;daughter, Katie who was only in public school for a few short \nmonths.&nbsp; We did *not* have to teach her to obey or eliminate television or \nNintendo. The &#39;obeying&#39; part, imo,&nbsp; naturally occurred because she was \nalways respected and an intregal part in the decision making process of our \nfamily. Even at the tender age of 5, she had a voice.&nbsp; </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Abadi MT Condensed Light\">Television or game machines \n(including the computer) were never treated as a &quot;hands off&quot; item. Yes, both \ndd&#39;s have done their share of zoning out at the TV but they THEN decide enough \nis enough and they choose to turn it off and find many other activities to \ndo.&nbsp; Yes, we are always exposing them  to new experiences as was mentioned \nin the Anderson post and that has been a big part in broadening their horizons. \nBut TV has also been an important part. </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Abadi MT Condensed Light\">The most recent example occurred \nduring this past year. Katie, now 14.5, likes to stay up late watching TV&nbsp; \nor studying and she sleeps late in the a.m.&nbsp; She&#39;s on her own body clock \nschedule and after attempts of trying to change it, I decided it was something \nnot worth changing.&nbsp; Anyway, on channel 48 (here in the east), Katie \nwatched a show called Trauma in the E.R.&nbsp; I caught a glimpse of it once and \nwith all the blood and guts, I quickly exited the room for it was *not* my cup \nof tea. Frankly, I was surprised that Katie was even watching it because she had \n*never* before had the stomach to watch even a splinter being removed.&nbsp; \n</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Abadi MT Condensed Light\">As months passed,&nbsp;Katie came to \nme and wanted to know what she needed to study to become a doctor. I quickly \nresearched all I could get my hands on about becoming a doctor and reported back \nthat a well-rounded education was important and it wouldn&#39;t hurt to have some \nscience courses covered ahead of time as well as Latin. (there were \nothers&nbsp;subjects but I won&#39;t go into that here).&nbsp; She asked that I take \nher to Borders, which I did, and she picked out Anatomy &amp; Physiology (<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://occ.awlonline.com/bookbind/pubbooks/marieb-essentials/index.html\">http://occ.awlonline.com/bookbind/pubbooks/marieb-essentials/index.html</a>&gt;. \nShe has been reading/teaching herself anatomy&nbsp;using a  book that a lot of \ncurriculum coordinators would&#39;ve declared too hard for her age.&nbsp; Now, this \nwasn&#39;t an inexpensive book and I realized that&nbsp; if we were going down the \n&quot;doctor&quot; road, it would be prudent to make *sure* she enjoyed that field based \non more than a TV show. Luckily, I have a&nbsp;acquaintance friend who is an \nanesthesiologist and she was willing to allow Katie to shadow her around on her \ndaily routine. </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Abadi MT Condensed Light\">The day arrived and Katie was \nsupposed to be in front of the O.R at 6:30 (yeah, sure... I&#39;m thinking to \nmyself. This, in itself, is a true test!).&nbsp; I was surprised when Katie woke \nup at 4:45 (willingly ..... and *cheerfully*!) and was at the O.R. by 6:15. She \nwas met by our friend, dressed in scrubs and with&nbsp;second set in hand \nfor&nbsp;Katie to wear.&nbsp; This is it, I&#39;m thinking to myself.&nbsp; If the \ndress code doesn&#39;t get to her, we are making progress. (anyone with a teenage \ndaughter will probably understand what I mean by that&lt;g&gt;).</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Abadi MT Condensed Light\">I left the hospital making sure the \ncell phone was turned on because I was worried that someone would call and say, \n&quot;Katie fainted when she saw blood. Come get her&quot;.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Abadi MT Condensed Light\">Time drug by that morning for me and \nI was eager to pick her up at the appointed noon time.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t know what \nto expect........</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Abadi MT Condensed Light\">......and then I saw&nbsp;Katie come \naround the corner&nbsp;of the O.R. and her gait said it all. My eyes moved up to \nher face and&nbsp;Katie was all smiles and there was this glow that I can&#39;t \nbegin to describe. We&nbsp; did our &quot;thank you&#39;s&quot; to everyone and then left. \nBefore we were out of the hospital, Katie declared,&nbsp; &quot;now THAT&#39;s what I \nwant to be... a DOCTOR. Actually, I want to be a neurosurgeon or an Emergency \nRoom Doctor.&quot; </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Abadi MT Condensed Light\">Katie&#39;s morning had consisted of \nwatching (from four feet away) a tumor removal from a woman&#39;s side. After that \nprocedure, they went to peek in on some brain surgery&nbsp;where Doctor invited \nKatie to pull up a step stool so she could get a better view. Then, the Doctor \nproceeded to tell her what the layers of body parts were, what that black hole \nin this person&#39;s brain was ( cancerous area removed from a previous surgery, \nwhich had returned).&nbsp; Katie said he used words the size of a suburban and \nshe hadn&#39;t heard of most of them.&nbsp; But, since that time, she&#39;s come across \nthem in her anatomy book and remembers them.&nbsp; Her dedication to her chosen \ngoal is phenomenal and I can honestly say it comes from within her own soul. As \nher parents, her father and I had little to do with it, other than providing the \ntransportation and the money for the books.&nbsp; Had our situation been \ndifferent and I were directing her toward her future goals, I can assure you, I \nwould not have chosen such a difficult path and the natural desire to learn \ncould&#39;ve been crushed. </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Abadi MT Condensed Light\">So, in closing, I think it&#39;s of the \nutmost importance that we let our children find their own paths and yes, even \ntv, computer games and videos can lead to a successful ending.&nbsp; Trust that \nyour children will stop when they&#39;ve had enough (of the &#39;bad&#39; stuff, such as tv) \nand will move on to bigger and better things. </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Abadi MT Condensed Light\">Sarah Carothers</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Abadi MT Condensed Light\"><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a></font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:raley@...\" title=\"raley@...\">Raley \n  Family</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\"\n title=\"Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Monday, October 30, 2000 11:03 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] The \n  Parent&#39;s Essential Active Role in Unschooling</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>&gt; son.&nbsp; This is his first year homeschooling.&nbsp; \n  We&#39;ve been having a hard time<br>&gt; pinpointing his interests.&nbsp; It is \n  like pulling teeth.&nbsp; He is bascially not<br>&gt; interested in \n  anything.&nbsp; He&#39;d rather sit around doing workbook pages and<br>&gt; \n  playing his gameboy when he is done.

But I will<br/>\nanswer your post as an &quot;older and wiser&quot; mother of 24 years and homeschooler<br/>\nof 11 years, whose been there, done that, and made all the mistakes.<br/>\nWhen we started to homeschool, I took a 6th grade girl out of a Christian<br/>\nschool.  The first year was spent teaching her to obey, and teaching her<br/>\ndiligence, something we had lost during those school years.  First I want to<br/>\nsuggest, if you don&#39;t have the courage to throw that gameboy out, at least<br/>\nrestrict his use of it to an hour or two a day, after he has done something<br/>\nworthwhile with his time.  Now, you need to give him something<br/>\n to take it&#39;s place.  When we threw out the TV and video games, I found out<br/>\nmy children had all kinds of interests.   My oldest son (age 15) out to be<br/>\nan<br/>\nincredible artist.  Our church is going to use his work on their calender<br/>\nthis year.  My second son (age 13) has learned an interest in knife making.<br/>\nTell him you will buy him something, or take him somewhere to take up the<br/>\ngameboy time.  It just has to be worthwhile.  Then don&#39;t allow anything else<br/>\nlike that in your home.  Please, don&#39;t be afraid to lead him.  You don&#39;t<br/>\nhave all those years of experience for nothing!!  God gave you to him and<br/>\nhim to you, for you to teach and train him in the way he should go.  Don&#39;t<br/>\nlose these valueable years, because when they are gone, they are gone.  And<br/>\nbelieve me, they pass a lot faster than you think.  My first two are grown<br/>\nand have their own families now.<br/>\nCarla Raley<br/>\nJacksboro, Texas<br/>\nAs for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.
