My three were in foster care when we adopted them and food was <br/>\na big issue with them. Some of the things we did was:<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I did: *I posted this on unschoolinginfo and copied it <br/>\nhere*<br/>\n<br/>\n**I started by asking if they were ready for breakfast, lunch or <br/>\nsnack instead of just making it and giving it to them. To my <br/>\nsurprise, my daughters are having breakfast about an hour later than <br/>\nI would have been giving it to them. <br/>\n<br/>\n**I&#39;ve also started asking them what they want for breakfast, lunch <br/>\nor snack instead of just making one of the things I know they like <br/>\nand just giving it to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n**I&#39;ve also stopped limited cookies and cakes. When they want <br/>\ncookies for a snack, I very casually hand them the bag and ask them <br/>\nto put it away when they&#39;re finished....intead of taking out 3-4 <br/>\ncookies and telling them that&#39;s all they can have if they ask for <br/>\nmore. I&#39;ve found that they eat less cookies now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of this helps and maybe gives you some ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (7), Shawna (10) & Cimion (13)<br/>\nAdopted into our hearts October 30, 2003<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.foreverparents.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;momspeapods&quot; <br/>\n&lt;jagreensboro@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am new to the list and new to unschooling.

We have<br/>\n&gt; been deschooling <br/>\n&gt; ourselves for about a month now. For the most part I<br/>\n&gt; feel it is going <br/>\n&gt; well. We have good days and not so good days. The<br/>\n&gt; biggest struggle we <br/>\n&gt; are having is with the eating habits of our two<br/>\n&gt; sons. They are young <br/>\n&gt; just 7&5 and have always been rather picky eaters. I<br/>\n&gt; was hoping that <br/>\n&gt; allowing them the freedom to make their own<br/>\n&gt; decisions over what they <br/>\n&gt; eat, that they would decide to make some better food<br/>\n&gt; choices. Instead <br/>\n&gt; they have become worse than ever wanting to eat<br/>\n&gt; candy,chips,cookies <br/>\n&gt; and whatever other junk they can find. I know its<br/>\n&gt; only been a month <br/>\n&gt; since they have been allowed this freedom but, after<br/>\n&gt; a trip to the <br/>\n&gt; dentist with our first cavity I am a bit concerned.<br/>\n&gt; I would appreciate <br/>\n&gt; any advise or encouragement anyone has to offer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I joined this list a little over a month ago and<br/>\n&gt; have been encouraged <br/>\n&gt; through other posts. I would like to thank all of<br/>\n&gt; you for helping us <br/>\n&gt; to make the decision to change from a burntout<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling family <br/>\n&gt; into a loving unschooling family. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks you,<br/>\n&gt; Jenn<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

About a year or so ago,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1627649461\">I&#39;ve got a 7 1/2 yr old DS who has never been regulated in his <br/>\neating (that is, beyond the real world constraints of budget and <br/>\nsuch). About a year or so ago, he &#39;discovered&#39; swiss cake rolls <br/>\n(chocolate cake rolled up with cream and coated with chocolate <br/>\nsimilar to a mini-jelly roll). Boy did he want them - first thing in <br/>\nthe morning, before bed, and in between. We&#39;d pick up a box at the <br/>\nmarket each week and he kept eating them up and waiting until the <br/>\nnext box. One week, I noted they were on special 5 boxes for $5. So, <br/>\nwhen we got to that spot in the market I told DS to get 5 boxes. <br/>\nYou&#39;d&#39;ve thought I handed him $1000! His eyes lit up, his face was <br/>\nglowing, as he piled in the 5 boxes. When we got home, he ate some. <br/>\nNext day he ate more. Third day not as many. By the time we got to <br/>\nthe 3rd box, they were mostly sitting there and I was taking one <br/>\npacket (they are packaged in pairs within the larger box) to work <br/>\neach day in my lunch and he hasn&#39;t looked at them since. He&#39;s done <br/>\nthe same with Jello puddings (the premade kind) and other things. <br/>\nThrough it all, we still have other foods available for him and he <br/>\neats them as well. And he is now developing his own sense of balance <br/>\nabout food - he&#39;ll -choose- to eat some cheese and crackers or <br/>\nsomething in and around sweets at a party for instance. He knows he <br/>\njust feels better that way and has more energy, less frustration. <br/>\nWe&#39;ve talked about the roles of protein, vitamins, carbs, sugary <br/>\nfoods, etc. Not in &#39;better or worse&#39; terms but just basic what they <br/>\ndo in your body stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne reason, aside from simply finally being free, that what is <br/>\ngenerally classed as &#39;junk food&#39; might be a current target is that <br/>\nit is easy access - single serving perhaps or already bite sized or <br/>\nno cooking/prep needed, easy to eat while watching a movie or <br/>\nplaying a game. That&#39;s a big move toward independence plus it&#39;s <br/>\navailable immediately when they feel like eating. In amongst it all, <br/>\nhow about bringing them some cut up fruit and veggies (whatever they <br/>\nusually like) with some fun dips - peanut butter, or yogurt dip, or <br/>\ncream cheese and honey (this is nice with apple slices - add a <br/>\nspritz of cinnamon), or ranch dip, or whatever; cubes of cheese or <br/>\nstrng cheese or cheese shapes (get slices of favorite cheese - <br/>\nprovolone, american, cheddar, etc and use mini-cookie cutters to <br/>\nmake shapes) with some crackers. Include chips or pretzels or <br/>\nwhatever alongside as well. Basically, make all things easy access. <br/>\nSnacks about every 2 to 3 hrs are about what works with my DS - if <br/>\nhe goes too long, he heads for whatever he can grab quickly (which <br/>\nmay be an apple, may be a pudding cup). But then again I do the same <br/>\nthing if I get really hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler Waynforth","from":"&quot;Schuyler Waynforth&quot; &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyler_waynforth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: need advise on eating habits","postDate":"1134671331","msgId":110728,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRuc2NsNCtzYnRxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDOUVFRkRCLUJBMTItNDQwMC1BQ0JGLUU5NTlGNTkyRkMwOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":110726,"nextInTopic":110729,"prevInTime":110727,"nextInTime":110729,"topicId":110725,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

One of the first things their daughter ever said to me was<br/>\nthat she didn&#39;t eat sweets &#39;cause they were bad for her.  I made some<br/>\nnoncommital noise.  Or maybe repeated what she said or something. <br/>\nAnyhow, when she came to ours I found her in the kitchen on more than<br/>\none occasion very quietly putting her hand in our very public and full<br/>\ncandy bowl.  It&#39;s right next to the fruit.  It&#39;s often full of things<br/>\nthat I have to throw away because they&#39;ve melted as neither Simon nor<br/>\nLinnaea want to eat them.  We had gum in the bowl.  Sugar-free gum<br/>\nbecause the dentist suggested that Linnaea&#39;s weak teeth might do well<br/>\nwith frequent gum chewing and that her cavities had little to do with<br/>\nwhat she ate.  This little girl had never had gum before and Linnaea<br/>\nshowed her how to chew it, but she kept eating it.  Slowly and with<br/>\ncareful little bites chewing it and swallowing it.  She made sure that<br/>\nher mother and stepfather never saw.  Eventually she was found out. <br/>\nThe scene was so painful.  They leapt on her and screeched about how<br/>\ngum is a petroleum product so she was swallowing a lump of petroleum.<br/>\n David and I intervened a little, but probably not enough.  I always<br/>\nfeel so awkward in those situations.  We tried to make light of the<br/>\nsituation and are now weighing whether we want to ever have them over<br/>\nagain.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe little girl was completely screwed from the beginning.  Because<br/>\nshe has limited access to sweets, pretty much completely, it is the<br/>\nholy grail of foods.  Whenever she comes over she will gorge because<br/>\nshe will never not know scarcity.  She will never trust that the sweet<br/>\nflavor will be something that she can experience with any kind of<br/>\nregularity.  And her parents can point at that response and use it to<br/>\njustify their reticence to let her have sweets.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please read lots of this:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/\">http://sandradodd.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; and all of this:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/t/economics\">http://sandradodd.com/t/economics</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s by Pam Sorooshian, and is &quot;Economics of Restricting TV Watching  <br/>\n&gt; of Children.&quot;  It will apply to food too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pam&#39;s piece on marginal value/utility is such a wonderful must be read<br/>\narticle.
