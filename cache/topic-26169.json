Perhaps a potholder size loom, a ball of<br/>\nyarn,(and a plastic &quot;child&#39;s&quot; needle...they are good<br/>\nfor weaving). Baggies (to hold little projects<br/>\nseparate and to hold stuff she gives away or snacks).<br/>\nSmall notebooks keep paper together and have less<br/>\n&quot;wasted&quot; or unused space so they aren&#39;t as heavy as<br/>\nloose paper, tape. Those new gel pens are great. A<br/>\npack of watercolors is fun. And a good, long, book or<br/>\ntwo is often helpful.

I&#39;ve found<br/>\nthat if is start a hand clap game or song that it<br/>\nisn&#39;t long before there is a CROWD of kids.....those<br/>\nare things that fit in a back pack easily. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd crackers for the kids....often they are grumpy<br/>\ncause they are hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\nGranola (homemade style)goes a loooooong way for food.<br/>\nBottled water is very helpful.  Easier than a canteen<br/>\n(what I used to carry). Clean healthy food is<br/>\nsometimes unavailable via bus. <br/>\n<br/>\nI found that the process of making something with<br/>\nchildren or letting them talk while they watch, helps<br/>\nthem be happy longer. However lots of Mamas are leary<br/>\nof strangers giving their children things.  Even<br/>\nstickers. Then again, I&#39;ve had strangers LEAVE their<br/>\nchildren with me for hours, days, and once for weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a sweet girl to think of the children even before<br/>\nshe goes! How brave you are to let her go......<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and flashlight, cell phone, matches, antibiotic<br/>\nointment, hydrgen pyroxide, bandaides, bunch of clean<br/>\nbandanas(usefull for eveything from dressings to<br/>\nwrappiing spains, to noses, and for acessories).Light<br/>\nweiht poncho and light wieght jacket tied to the<br/>\noutside of the pack(changeable weather), sweater,<br/>\ngood, several pairs of warm socks, some polyprops or<br/>\nother long johns rolled up in a corner (changeable<br/>\nweather) and a warm vest (to turn the light jacket<br/>\ninto a warm one with the sweater.
