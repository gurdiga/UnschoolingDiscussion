It says<br/>\ntoday&#39;s Oprah is &quot;Letters to Oprah Live&quot; so hsing&#39;s moment of glory may<br/>\nbe at hand!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe site, however, did not mention hsing specifically.  Thought it<br/>\nbetter to be safe than sorry - PLEASE share the word with your other<br/>\nlists...I&#39;ll be doing my best from this end!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been shared with several people that this coverage is in response<br/>\nto a deluge of letters the show received, as well as recommendations<br/>\nfrom Oprah&#39;s studio audience.  Some at NHEN have discussed that no<br/>\nmatter what type of job Oprah does with the topic - good, bad, or<br/>\nindifferent - it would behoove us to send another deluge of letters!<br/>\nRumor has it that Oprah didn&#39;t know anything about homeschooling prior<br/>\nto letters and recommendations -- maybe if she sees us rally again it<br/>\ncould lead to further coverage as she seems to have a soft spot for<br/>\neducation in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe website address is www.oprah.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8004,"nextTopicId":8003}}
