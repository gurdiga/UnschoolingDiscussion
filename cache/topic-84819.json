Been lurking last month.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould like to hear any thoughts re: pets death and grieving times.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just lost our 8yr. male cat to an illness.  Kids grieved about 4 <br/>\nhours and then wanted to look for a new kitten.  We got an 8 wk. old <br/>\nkitten next day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am trusting that this is the right decision but am a little <br/>\nworried that they may have grief start to fester with the quick turn <br/>\naround.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84781,"nextTopicId":84912}}
