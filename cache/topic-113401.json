Though both Marple and Poirot  <br/>\nrevolve around the psychological motivations for murder, the Miss  <br/>\nMarple ones are mostly &quot;country estate&quot; mysteries and Hercule Poirot&#39;s  <br/>\ntake place in more exotic places.

My aunt bought both for me,  <br/>\nincluding Poe when I was young and they became something to aspire  <br/>\nto ;-) I even worked through several Poe stories with a dictionary  <br/>\nnext to me.
