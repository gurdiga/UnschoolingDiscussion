Both<br/>\nwomen are anthropologists. I give the Small book to every pregnant woman I<br/>\nknow. It&#39;s not a dictatorial &quot;you must parent this way&quot; kind of work, but it<br/>\nis highly informative, especially about things like the importance of touch<br/>\nand frequency and duration of breastfeeding.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\nLaura Simeon<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thisbe@...\">thisbe@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kjsl.com/~thisbe/\">http://www.kjsl.com/~thisbe/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Cory and Amy Nelson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:amynelson3@...\">amynelson3@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, December 09, 2000 5:23 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: advice please<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just hope Accalia is still nursing at 3 because it will drive sooo many<br/>\n&gt; people I know crazy &lt;wicked little grin&gt;.
