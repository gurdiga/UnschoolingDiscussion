They&#39;ve had a blast finding the frozen creature/ toy just like in <br/>\nthe movies, but they&#39;ve also discovered all kinds of really cool things <br/>\nfrom the way water expands when it freezes and breaks the cup, to the <br/>\nway it freezes in different places first. They&#39;ve had fun taking it out <br/>\nin all different stages, from just the membrane on top to an ice cup <br/>\nbecause the sides and bottom are frozen but not the center, on and on. <br/>\nIt&#39;s also amazing how much fun a plain ice popsicle is when they&#39;ve made <br/>\nit themselves. *g* I&#39;m casually looking for those rubbermaid popsicle <br/>\nmakers; I&#39;ll step up the search after the move. Those&#39;ll be hours of fun <br/>\nthis summer for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I want to get at here is that while I can totally <br/>\nunderstand the desire for a list of cool things to do and I can see how <br/>\ngreat such lists are to help break out of a rut, the best, most fun, <br/>\nmost interesting learning that goes on in my home is the spontaneous <br/>\nkind rather than the list following kind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most glorious part about finding a way to say &quot;yes&quot; is that it <br/>\nnurtures and encourages *each* child&#39;s spontaneous learning rather than <br/>\noverlaying them with other children&#39;s (or adult&#39;s) learning activities, <br/>\nhowever cool, however well-intentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe danger I see with generating such lists and putting them somewhere <br/>\neasily accessible, rather than following the natural flow of ideas that <br/>\ncome across email discussion, is that these lists can be twisted into <br/>\nanother form of curriculum, an unschooling list of &quot;what your child <br/>\nneeds to know,&quot; that could prevent parents from really stretching and <br/>\ngrowing into seeing and following the ideas that spring up naturally in <br/>\ntheir own homes. Encouraging a parent to say &quot;yes,&quot; to participate in, <br/>\nnurture and follow her child&#39;s journeys will, in my opinion, get that <br/>\nfamily more quickly to an Unschooling place than any posted activity <br/>\nlist ever could.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (7), Julia (6), Sam (5)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;With our thoughts, we make the world.&quot; ~~Buddha</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Four topics","postDate":"1117509825","msgId":106291,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5MS40MDVjMGI5MS4yZmNkMzJjMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":106290,"nextInTopic":106293,"prevInTime":106290,"nextInTime":106292,"topicId":106248,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/30/2005 9:14:18 PM Mountain Daylight Time, mamaaj2000@yahoo.com writes: I like  the discussions about strewing here, but I d also like to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-617855702\">In a message dated 5/30/2005 9:14:18 PM Mountain Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamaaj2000@...\">mamaaj2000@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nI like  the discussions about strewing here, but I&#39;d also like to see <br/>\nsome of the  more practical lists of things to strew on the <br/>\nUnschooling Basics  list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------<br/>\n <br/>\nThese have ideas, one way or another:<br/>\n <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/checklists_\">http://sandradodd.com/checklists_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/checklists)\">http://sandradodd.com/checklists)</a> <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/typical_\">http://sandradodd.com/typical_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/typical)\">http://sandradodd.com/typical)</a> <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strewing_\">http://sandradodd.com/strewing_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strewing)\">http://sandradodd.com/strewing)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: When &quot;saying yes&quot; is offensive","postDate":"1117509409","msgId":106290,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDliLjYwOGQ5YjAzLjJmY2QzMTIxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":106289,"nextInTopic":106291,"prevInTime":106289,"nextInTime":106291,"topicId":106248,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/30/2005 8:59:52 PM Mountain Daylight Time, mamaaj2000@yahoo.com writes: I ll  report back about what happens with eggs...and I bet it will","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1033518500\">In a message dated 5/30/2005 8:59:52 PM Mountain Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamaaj2000@...\">mamaaj2000@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll  report back about what happens with eggs...and I bet it will be <br/>\nin less  than 3 months!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it doesn&#39;t need to have anything to do with eggs.

I can&#39;t just run upstairs to the tub to let one of them explore <br/>\nright at the moment they want to!

I can try to say yes more, <br/>\nthat&#39;s the point. If the baby is asleep, the kids could stand on <br/>\nchairs and play with eggs in the sink. Dh might be horrified by the <br/>\nidea, so I&#39;ll do it while he&#39;s at work and clean up and go get more <br/>\neggs before he comes home so that he sees happy kids, not a mess and <br/>\nan eggless house!

Baby steps. Sometimes I think what happens for new list<br/>\nmembers is that they are overwhelmed with the scope of the unschooling<br/>\nvision. It takes time to digest all the ways that unschooling<br/>\ninfluences your parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for instance, I had a child who definitely needed to have control<br/>\nover his education. That drew me to unschooling. But I hadn&#39;t thought<br/>\nabout the fact that maybe he needed control over lots of other things<br/>\ntoo. Then that discovery set up a crisis - would my husband be on<br/>\nboard for letting go of chores, control over movie viewing and music?<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I had to rethink how we parented and how we thought about<br/>\nparenting, not just how to educate him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a moment where you think you can get away with doing it<br/>\ndifferently (than list members) because you are a unique family, or<br/>\nyou have a theology/philosophy that is different than what is<br/>\npostulated on the list and therefore you get a &quot;free pass&quot; to unschool<br/>\nin a unique way... <br/>\n<br/>\nBut then that way doesn&#39;t produce the results advertized on the list<br/>\nso you come back with questions hoping someone will hear that you are<br/>\nstruggling and what you really want is permission to struggle, not<br/>\nreminders to change. &lt;g&gt; So then frustration sets in as the cognitive<br/>\ndissonance grows. Confidence wanes and going back to familiar<br/>\nterritory is easier than wading further into the deep water of<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes a long, long time to get it (I am still in that process, even<br/>\nthough I&#39;ve been reading this list for two and half years and started<br/>\nunschooling (or so I thought) right then). I keep seeing ways I<br/>\nretreat from unschooling with a few of my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe layers of (excuse my French) educational sh** I have to weed<br/>\nthrough that I didn&#39;t even know were there.... Ugh!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be hard for those of you who have unschooled all your lives to<br/>\ngrasp what a worldview crasher unschooling is. And then those of us<br/>\nlike me trying to &quot;get it&quot; live in communities that reinforce the<br/>\nbelief that unschooling is crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample: I called college admissions for one of my kids last week<br/>\n(she&#39;s interested in Boston College). When the admissions counselor<br/>\nstarted ticking off what my dd needed to do as a homeschooler to get<br/>\nin, I felt that familiar sick feeling of panic. What if she wants to<br/>\ngo there but I&#39;ve prevented her by not having her follow a curriculum<br/>\n(which they stated over and over again she had to do)?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what am I to do? And can that be discussed here? Those are the<br/>\nkinds of thoughts that run through my head.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I am over feeling attacked by challenging feedback. I<br/>\nwelcome the direct approach. Sometimes that is the only way to &quot;get<br/>\nit.&quot; But I can see that those who feel fragile find it difficult to<br/>\nhonestly share where they are stuck because they are terrified of<br/>\nfailing their kids or being correctd and don&#39;t have the confidence to<br/>\ntrust unschooling all the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] When &quot;saying yes&quot; is offensive","postDate":"1117415501","msgId":106253,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkxMDE4MzdiNjMxYTdiYTc0MDVjYTRlYmQzMTBmNWMyQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDQyOUE0RjVCLjEwMjAzQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PGMxLjU5NjA4ZDE0LjJmY2I3NWYzQGFvbC5jb20+IDw0MjlBNEY1Qi4xMDIwM0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":106252,"nextInTopic":106254,"prevInTime":106252,"nextInTime":106254,"topicId":106248,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And conversely I&#39;m confident they DO  think <br/>\nparents should say &quot;no,&quot; early and often, and back it up with a stick or a  <br/>\nbelt (or other &quot;consequences&quot;).  In their cases, because their  priority is to <br/>\nplease religious authorities who say they are pleasing God, they  should (within <br/>\ntheir philosophy) say no.<br/>\n <br/>\nI should, within my philosophy, say yes.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeople who don&#39;t have  a philosophy don&#39;t know when to say yes or  no.

Well... unless <br/>\nit&#39;s encouragement about wanting specific materials to  use.  So there the <br/>\nproblem comes.  Some people don&#39;t think &quot;everything  in the whole wide world&quot; is <br/>\nspecific enough, and that &quot;everything that comes  into your path today&quot; is <br/>\nnot much better.  I disagree with them, but that&#39;s  because I&#39;ve used those <br/>\nthings to good effect for years and I see other  unschoolers use them <br/>\nfantastically.  Like magic, there the world is,  seeping right into your house every day, <br/>\nshining through the windows, oozing  under the door, open for exploration all <br/>\nthe time.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=- I was put off by the argumentative, overly philosophical,  <br/>\nit-has-to-be-all-unschooling-all-the-time viewpoint.-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen people are put off they are.  That&#39;s fine.  <br/>\nBut &quot;overly philosophical&quot;?  <br/>\nThe alternative is &quot;underly philosophical,&quot; and that won&#39;t help unschoolers  <br/>\nmuch at all.<br/>\nAs to whether it has to be all unschooling all the time, it only needs to  be <br/>\nthat for those who want unschooling.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs with other philosophies, it either is a priority or it isn&#39;t; it&#39;s  either <br/>\nan integral thing or it isn&#39;t.<br/>\nIf I want to be honest, I need to be all honest all the time.  I can&#39;t  say <br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m honest, late afternoons and weekends.&quot;   Or &quot;I believe  natural learning <br/>\ncan work, after I&#39;m through with their lessons.&quot;  Or &quot;I  think all things are <br/>\nrelated, after school hours, but we don&#39;t talk about  history during science <br/>\nlessons and we don&#39;t bring literature up during  history.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n-=-Perhaps in the end, Idon&#39;t argree with radical unschooling, and it seems  <br/>\nthat that is what this list is about.-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n&#39;Seems&#39; madam?

Probably lots of unschooled kids know that quote, even if they  &quot;aren&#39;t <br/>\nold enough&quot; or &quot;haven&#39;t studied that.&quot;  And if they don&#39;t, it  doesn&#39;t matter <br/>\na single bit, if they know how to use google.
