My family has<br/>\nmade my comments about his lack of emotional stability - that I am<br/>\nconstantly uprooting him. I feel so guilty about all of this. Every time I<br/>\nmake a change he is more and more devastated. Things are FINALLY stable in<br/>\nmy life. But I am *so* cautious about making any changes in his life. I<br/>\n*could* have homeschooled him last year and avoided all this mess but I lost<br/>\nmy job just a few weeks before school started and he already knew he was to<br/>\nstart and I had NO confidence that my unemployment status would be anything<br/>\nbut temporary. I still have days when I am in total fear that something will<br/>\nhappen that will require me to have to put my kids back in school/daycare<br/>\nand those days are what make the jump to homeschooling so scary for me. But<br/>\nthe thoughts that I am consciously choosing an action that I KNOW will<br/>\nabsolutely devastate my child, emotionally, is a really HARD thing to do. I<br/>\nam keeping to my convictions that homeschooling is for the greater good and<br/>\nthat my life IS stable and will continue to be stable but I am treading very<br/>\nlightly because of the implications of uprooting this child from a place he<br/>\nloves and feels safe yet again in his short six years of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nNicki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jon and Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"svLWHw3_rlWaWO6TMJGcTw5l-GOjJPtQRyH0jxXdi6D-q32WTkpl7VCbwQusuUdYzHqM-JC1eis78GEsCte-w0UbGXIJNBWnM7WV2CyCIeXK","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] He won&#39;t miss his friends","postDate":"991142263","msgId":22145,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjEwMWMwZTg0MSRjMDQ0NjU0MCQwMTAwYThjMEBtc2hvbWUubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFFRU1JTUFDSUxPTUlMTERHTklORUVHTkNQQUEubmlja2lAZGV0cm9pdG1hbWEuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22142,"nextInTopic":22149,"prevInTime":22144,"nextInTime":22146,"topicId":22116,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter went to kindergarten and has kept up her friendship with her best friend.

It can be done with some effort from the parents.  Are you<br/>\nkeeping him in school through the end of the year because he wants to stay<br/>\nthere?  I would be very concerned about the fact that he feels this adult<br/>\nhas the right to tell him what he&#39;s allowed to do and capable of doing.<br/>\nMaybe the best message you could give him to show that she does not have<br/>\nthat power is to take him out now?   Every day he spends there is another<br/>\nday to undo later, and if you&#39;re feeling that she has more power in your<br/>\nhome than you do, I&#39;d consider that a serious negative affect of being in<br/>\nschool. I&#39;m not trying to second guess you - obviously you know the<br/>\nsituation best.  My gut reaction is just get him out of there :). ~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Nicki Clark [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nicki@...\">nicki@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 29, 2001 9:01 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] He won&#39;t miss his friends<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;When he realizes he can<br/>\ncomplete school work in a couple of hours that will take his friends<br/>\nseven hours, he will see it differently.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I have tried to logic him out of it and it&#39;s just something he&#39;s going<br/>\nto have to go through before he can fully feel that it&#39;ll be alright.
