It can also be a huge<br/>\n  waste of time.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  All absolutely true.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What I&#39;m understanding the attitude to be about college, when it seems like <br/>\n  &quot;whatever&quot; from some homeschoolers, is that they hope their children are <br/>\n  growing up to see value in people and professions and jobs and hobbies <br/>\n  WITHOUT first asking &quot;Do they have a college degree?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Too many people have NO idea what they like or want when they graduate from <br/>\n  high school.  All they&#39;ve been encouraged to want or need is to get into <br/>\n  college, and some get out of college STILL without a clue or direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I enjoyed school, personally.  Enjoyed college, and am glad I didn&#39;t drop <br/>\n  out.  Finished at 20.  Paid off my own loans.  Still have friends from those <br/>\n  times.  Still in touch with a couple of professors.  Went to the funeral of <br/>\n  one a few years back.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My kids know there are specialties that need training.  They know some need <br/>\n  college, some need other training.  They are not &quot;preparing for college&quot; in <br/>\n  that focussed, memorizing, cramming way most people think of it.  They are <br/>\n  preparing for life.  College is a part of life.  It doesn&#39;t have to begin at <br/>\n  17 or 18.  It doesn&#39;t have to happen in four years.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I majored in English.  I went to school with people who had never ever <br/>\n  written a single word that wasn&#39;t assigned by a teacher.  There were people <br/>\n  there who ONLY knew how to read assigned books.   Instead of having read for <br/>\n  fun, things they just came across, they always chose their reading off lists <br/>\n  of books that were supposed to be read.  &quot;Classics.&quot;  WHY!?  Because they <br/>\n  were school-trained up to their ears in the idea that at each decision point <br/>\n  there was a &quot;right&quot; decision (traditional, conservative, leading toward &quot;a <br/>\n  goal,&quot;) and the wrong (time wasting, creative, personal, frivolous).<br/>\n<br/>\n  They weren&#39;t thinking, they were reacting the right way.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Some of them were in their 20&#39;s and still waiting for permission to be <br/>\n  individual humans.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think probably THAT is what people are trying to avoid when they say they <br/>\n  don&#39;t care whether their kids go to college.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

My husband is just now finishing his degree in a field<br/>\nthat interests him.  Our children have college funds set up for them by<br/>\ntheir papa (my father).  I think it&#39;s all great - if that&#39;s what you<br/>\nwant and where you want to be.  If not, then college isn&#39;t for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband, my father and I don&#39;t care if the kids use the college fund<br/>\nfor college, or traveling, or house payments, or books, whatever they<br/>\nchoose - it&#39;s theirs.  They will not be pressured into going.  As a<br/>\nmatter of fact our youngest is saying she will never go to school, ever,<br/>\neven college (she decided to try kindergarten this year and went one<br/>\nday.  She walked out of the classroom saying she got hit by another<br/>\nstudent three times, they only got to read one book, they spent most of<br/>\ntheir time waiting for other people and she&#39;s bored and doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\ngo back - so she didn&#39;t.  I&#39;m so proud of her.).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m trying to say, is that whether you go or not should be a<br/>\npersonal choice, and just because you decide to go does not mean you<br/>\nneed to finish it with a degree in your hand.  One of the smartest men I<br/>\nknow took classes that interested him over a ten year period and then -<br/>\n1 class away from his degree - he quit because he was done.  That&#39;s the<br/>\nway to do it in my book - just go after what interests you.<br/>\n<br/>\n2 cents from CA<br/>\nKate</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117801964,"authorName":"MO Milligans","from":"MO Milligans &lt;Ozarkren@...&gt;","profile":"trozark","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] careers and college","postDate":"1033237957","msgId":44778,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4xLjYuMi4yMDAyMDkyODEzMjkzOC4wMDlmOTcyMEBlZGlzb24ucmlwaW50ZXJuZXQuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFJRVBJUE9LTkRIQktCQ0RQRUNFQUVER0RPQUEubGl6YW5kZXJyb2xAY294Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDIwOTI4MTA1NzIzLjIwNTE3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44776,"nextInTopic":44792,"prevInTime":44777,"nextInTime":44779,"topicId":44706,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... == Oh, I don t know about that.

Our 15yod<br/>\nhas thought for a long time it was a waste to go to college and spend<br/>\ntons of money...most likely come out with debt and end up doing what she<br/>\nwants in the first place ~ be a mom!<br/>\n  She would be pressed to use her &quot;skills&quot; later on when she would rather<br/>\nbe at home with her children anyway. She is very much a people person and<br/>\nwould love to be working in the public even around minimum wage and happy<br/>\nthan having to settle on a career to pay a college debt.<br/>\n  I have wondered though whether many of the &quot;big&quot; advocates of college<br/>\nare from those that either never went or did not finish and feel they<br/>\nmissed out on higher paying jobs. Kind of unfulfilled I guess!<br/>\n  Our daughter is working p/t in a consignment shop and has helped<br/>\ncustomers put together outfits. The owner is thrilled (more sales) my <br/>\ndaughter loves it and a N.Y. City designer came in and heard her talking<br/>\nto a customer. He listened awhile and then later told my daughter she has<br/>\na natural talent and should go into designing or interior decorating.<br/>\nNeither of which appeals to her...she just loves people and putting<br/>\nthings together to make an outfit, decorate her room etc.<br/>\n  Our desire for her and the other children is to find what they want to<br/>\ndo and then go for it. Is that too simplistic?<br/>\nsharon<br/>\n  <br/>\n\r<br/>\n________________________________________________________________\r<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!\r<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!\r<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
