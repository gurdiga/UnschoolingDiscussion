It&#39;s so easy to be a dog owner. You feed it, train<br/>\n&gt; it, boss it around. It puts it&#39;s head on your knee and gazes at you as<br/>\n&gt; if you were a Rembrandt painting. It bounds indoors with enthusiasm when<br/>\n&gt; you call it. <br/>\n&gt; Then around age 13, your adoring little puppy turns into a big old cat.<br/>\n&gt; When you tell it to come inside, it looks amazed, as if wondering who<br/>\n&gt; died and made you emperor. Instead of dogging your doorsteps, it<br/>\n&gt; disappears. You won&#39;t see it again until it gets hungry -- then it<br/>\n&gt; pauses on its sprint through the kitchen long enough to turn its nose up<br/>\n&gt; at whatever you&#39;re serving. <br/>\n&gt; When you reach out to ruffle its head, in that old affectionate gesture,<br/>\n&gt; it twists away from you, then gives you a blank stare, as if trying to<br/>\n&gt; remember where it has seen you before. You, not realizing that the dog<br/>\n&gt; is now a cat, think something must be desperately wrong with it. It<br/>\n&gt; seems so antisocial, so distant, sort of depressed. It won&#39;t go on<br/>\n&gt; family outings. <br/>\n&gt; Since you&#39;re the one who raised it, taught it to fetch and stay and sit<br/>\n&gt; on command, you assume that you did something wrong. Flooded with guilt<br/>\n&gt; and fear, you redouble your efforts to make your pet behave. Only now<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re dealing with a cat, so everything that worked before now produces<br/>\n&gt; the opposite of the desired result. Call it, and it runs away. Tell it<br/>\n&gt; to sit, and it jumps on the counter. The more you go toward it, wringing<br/>\n&gt; your hands, the more it moves away. <br/>\n&gt; Instead of continuing to act like a dog owner, you can learn to behave<br/>\n&gt; like a cat owner. Put a dish of food near the door, and let it come to<br/>\n&gt; you. But remember that a cat needs your help and your affection too. Sit<br/>\n&gt; still, and it will come, seeking that warm, comforting lap it has not<br/>\n&gt; entirely forgotten. Be there to open the door for it. <br/>\n&gt; One day your grown-up child will walk into the kitchen, give you a big<br/>\n&gt; kiss and say, &quot;You&#39;ve been on your feet all day. Let me get those dishes<br/>\n&gt; for you.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; Then you will realize your cat is a dog again!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6831,"nextTopicId":6834}}
