There&#39;s a boy in our homeschool group who <br/>\nplays both.  Once you get one instrument down, others come more easily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGrowing up one of my best friends played Cello, Saxophone, and Piano.  All 3 <br/>\nof her brothers each played 2 or 3 instruments.  I was always so envious.  I <br/>\nremember plain as day, when the music teacher came into our classroom (4th <br/>\ngrade) and I answered the questions he asked the class easily.  He said I have <br/>\n&quot;violin hands.&quot;  I was so excited and went home and asked my parents if I could <br/>\ntake violin at school.  They said no, because I was already taking piano <br/>\nlessons.  I had always wanted to and finally took the plunge and started learning <br/>\nabout 3 years ago.  It has always been a sore spot with me.  I understood my <br/>\nparents probably couldn&#39;t afford it, but I think they were thinking more that one <br/>\ninstrument was enough.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo at least let her try it!!

I really appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The question that really made me think is <br/>\n&quot;Why can&#39;t she take violin now?&quot;.   <br/>\nI needed to hear that. If she&#39;s passionate about it...then she SHOULD take <br/>\nit. ( her brother 7 takes piano AND guitar).<br/>\nBut I think other reasons are that she already takes piano.... and she is <br/>\nonly 5. <br/>\nA  few questions I need to ponder:<br/>\nShould it be in addition to piano?<br/>\nShould she stop piano?...(even though we encourage our kids to finish out the <br/>\nyear and then re-evaluate). <br/>\nShe does like piano, she only started this past summer.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think I will take a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach for just a few months. Life <br/>\nIS a bit busy now (we are also building a house... ourselves&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;).<br/>\n  <br/>\n  I just got a real violin on ebay for her . And even if we get a better <br/>\nviolin  (or rent one) when she starts lessons, it was worth the price not to get a <br/>\n&quot;toy&quot; one.<br/>\n   <br/>\nThanks again for your words of wisdom!<br/>\n~Marcia...who thinks SHE may also take up violin in the near future <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85649,"nextTopicId":85658}}
