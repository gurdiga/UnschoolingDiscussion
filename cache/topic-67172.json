Holly, at nine, took the photo. She took lots of me, with a<br/>\n&gt; disposable camera, in a little wooded place of her  choosing.  She picked<br/>\nher<br/>\n&gt; favorites, and we sent<br/>\n&gt; them in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I took the just-arrived issue to her and showed her the cover, and<br/>\n&gt; then page 56, and said &quot;Look!

Or maybe I&#39;m more easily thrilled.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I think Holly takes the world for granted.<br/>\n&gt; And why not? The world is hers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The world wasn&#39;t mine when I was little. It<br/>\n&gt; belonged to grownups, and I was told how to sit,<br/>\n&gt; what to say, what to eat and how to hold the<br/>\n&gt; spoon. I was told where to play, who with, and<br/>\n&gt; how long. If I got dirty or tore my clothes I was<br/>\n&gt; in trouble. I was told what was good and what was<br/>\n&gt; bad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Holly takes the world for granted, and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; thrilled about that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One of my online friends, Anne Ohman, wrote this and gave me permission to<br/>\n&gt; quote it:  &quot;I know that when I sat in a Catholic church and the priest<br/>\nasked<br/>\n&gt; me to repeat, &quot;Lord, I am not Worthy to Receive You...&quot; I knew it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nMy<br/>\n&gt; Truth. I HAD to believe I was worthy...even though this was the message I<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; receiving everywhere...home, school, church...I just HAD to hold onto the<br/>\n&gt; tiniest glimmer of Hope that I WAS worthy of the beautiful gifts of Life.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I remember once I was a teenager, walking with several friends of mine,<br/>\ngoing<br/>\n&gt; north on Lower San Pedro Road, which parallels the Rio Grande in Espanola.<br/>\n&gt; We were walking slowly, playing with sticks and rocks.  I don&#39;t remember<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; the subject matter was, but I said &quot;I wonder how they do it in the REAL<br/>\n&gt; world.&quot;  One of them said &quot;This IS the real world.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t quite believe it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There I was with Jon Tsosie, from Santa Clara Pueblo, across the river;<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; DiAna Trujillo, whose dad was in the Bataan death march (yet living up the<br/>\n&gt; road);  and I think John DePaula was there that day, whose dad was from<br/>\n&gt; Queens, NY, and whose mom was from Trinidad, Colorado.  Maybe another kid<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; two.  I thought the real world was far from us.  That we were spectators<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; marginal not-even characters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe I thought that if you were good in school, you could grow up and<br/>\nbecome<br/>\n&gt; a real adult with job.  And if you were good in New Mexico, you could grow<br/>\nup<br/>\n&gt; and move to a more real place.  But somehow I had the idea that &quot;real&quot; was<br/>\n&gt; elsewhere.  And &quot;important&quot; was not me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the years since then I&#39;ve slowly grown to have a much different point<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; view.  But in Holly, when I showed her that picture, I saw that she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; worship &quot;elsewhere&quot; and she doesn&#39;t envy &quot;other.&quot;  She feels as real and<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; right as rain.  &quot;As right as rain.&quot;   A natural, worthwhile, real part of<br/>\n&gt; everything around her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My friend Mark grew up in North Dakota, and his relatives were of German<br/>\n&gt; farming families.  They were Lutheran.  There was no nonsense.  The way<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; Mark was put in his small place was that he was told &quot;You are full of<br/>\n&gt; yourself.&quot;  It wasn&#39;t said in a positive or a good way.  It was intended<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; be a deflating insult.  Mark doesn&#39;t have children, but we&#39;ve talked a lot<br/>\n&gt; about being and having children.  He likes that my children are full of<br/>\n&gt; themselves, and full of the whole world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes I&#39;m jealous.  Sometimes I think that it&#39;s a bad thing that Holly<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t thrilled about being published.  Then I think that maybe the main<br/>\n&gt; reason I am giddy at the idea of having my words in print is that it is<br/>\n&gt; evidence of reality.  It means I am up and out of school, and I am no<br/>\nlonger<br/>\n&gt; just in New Mexico.  And then that awareness brings me full circle.  Holly<br/>\n&gt; will not have to overcome the fear that she is unworthy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I remember one of the icons of hippiedom, the Desiderata.  It said &quot;You<br/>\nare a<br/>\n&gt; child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars.&quot;  That was a<br/>\n&gt; radical thought in the 1960&#39;s, for some people.  Belonging naturally to<br/>\nall<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s around you.  Being as solid and as real as a tree.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is what unschooling, though, has done for Holly.  She is not a<br/>\nstudent.<br/>\n&gt; She is Holly.  She is not a fourth grader.  She is Holly Dodd.  She has<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt; since birth, and she will be until or unless she decides to go by another<br/>\n&gt; name, but that will be her decision.  The world is hers in a way that the<br/>\n&gt; world has never been mine, not even now as an adult.  Sometimes I see<br/>\nmyself<br/>\n&gt; as a messy amalgamation of experiences, certificates, test scores and<br/>\nlabels,<br/>\n&gt; just come lately into the real world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I see my children living full, real lives today, right now.  I don&#39;t see<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; as students in preparation for life, who after a number of years and<br/>\nlessons<br/>\n&gt; might be considered &quot;completed&quot; or &quot;graduated.&quot;  It was a long way to<br/>\ncome,<br/>\n&gt; and I never even had to move.  I just had to look at what I considered to<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; real.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Desiderata was written by Max Erhmann, and for those who missed it<br/>\nthen<br/>\n&gt; or had it then and have missed it since, here it is:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Desiderata<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all<br/>\n&gt; persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly and listen to others, even<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; dull and ignorant; they too have their story.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexations to the spirit. If<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter, for always<br/>\n&gt; there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your<br/>\n&gt; achievements as well as your plans.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real<br/>\npossession<br/>\n&gt; in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business<br/>\naffairs,<br/>\n&gt; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what<br/>\nvirtue<br/>\n&gt; there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; heroism.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about<br/>\n&gt; love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is perennial as<br/>\n&gt; the grass.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and<br/>\n&gt; loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars. You<br/>\n&gt; have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; universe is unfolding as it should.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive God to be; and<br/>\nwhatever<br/>\n&gt; your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; your soul.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful<br/>\n&gt; world. Be cheerful.

I HAD to believe I was worthy...even though this was the message I was <br/>\nreceiving everywhere...home, school, church...I just HAD to hold onto the <br/>\ntiniest glimmer of Hope that I WAS worthy of the beautiful gifts of Life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember once I was a teenager, walking with several friends of mine, going <br/>\nnorth on Lower San Pedro Road, which parallels the Rio Grande in Espanola.  <br/>\nWe were walking slowly, playing with sticks and rocks.  I don&#39;t remember what <br/>\nthe subject matter was, but I said &quot;I wonder how they do it in the REAL <br/>\nworld.&quot;  One of them said &quot;This IS the real world.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t quite believe it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere I was with Jon Tsosie, from Santa Clara Pueblo, across the river;  and <br/>\nDiAna Trujillo, whose dad was in the Bataan death march (yet living up the <br/>\nroad);  and I think John DePaula was there that day, whose dad was from <br/>\nQueens, NY, and whose mom was from Trinidad, Colorado.  Maybe another kid or <br/>\ntwo.  I thought the real world was far from us.  That we were spectators and <br/>\nmarginal not-even characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I thought that if you were good in school, you could grow up and become <br/>\na real adult with job.  And if you were good in New Mexico, you could grow up <br/>\nand move to a more real place.  But somehow I had the idea that &quot;real&quot; was <br/>\nelsewhere.  And &quot;important&quot; was not me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the years since then I&#39;ve slowly grown to have a much different point of <br/>\nview.  But in Holly, when I showed her that picture, I saw that she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nworship &quot;elsewhere&quot; and she doesn&#39;t envy &quot;other.&quot;  She feels as real and as <br/>\nright as rain.  &quot;As right as rain.&quot;   A natural, worthwhile, real part of <br/>\neverything around her.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend Mark grew up in North Dakota, and his relatives were of German <br/>\nfarming families.  They were Lutheran.  There was no nonsense.  The way that <br/>\nMark was put in his small place was that he was told &quot;You are full of <br/>\nyourself.&quot;  It wasn&#39;t said in a positive or a good way.  It was intended to <br/>\nbe a deflating insult.  Mark doesn&#39;t have children, but we&#39;ve talked a lot <br/>\nabout being and having children.  He likes that my children are full of <br/>\nthemselves, and full of the whole world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I&#39;m jealous.  Sometimes I think that it&#39;s a bad thing that Holly <br/>\nwasn&#39;t thrilled about being published.  Then I think that maybe the main <br/>\nreason I am giddy at the idea of having my words in print is that it is <br/>\nevidence of reality.  It means I am up and out of school, and I am no longer <br/>\njust in New Mexico.  And then that awareness brings me full circle.  Holly <br/>\nwill not have to overcome the fear that she is unworthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember one of the icons of hippiedom, the Desiderata.  It said &quot;You are a <br/>\nchild of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars.&quot;  That was a <br/>\nradical thought in the 1960&#39;s, for some people.  Belonging naturally to all <br/>\nthat&#39;s around you.  Being as solid and as real as a tree.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what unschooling, though, has done for Holly.  She is not a student.  <br/>\nShe is Holly.  She is not a fourth grader.  She is Holly Dodd.  She has been <br/>\nsince birth, and she will be until or unless she decides to go by another <br/>\nname, but that will be her decision.  The world is hers in a way that the <br/>\nworld has never been mine, not even now as an adult.  Sometimes I see myself <br/>\nas a messy amalgamation of experiences, certificates, test scores and labels, <br/>\njust come lately into the real world. <br/>\n<br/>\nI see my children living full, real lives today, right now.  I don&#39;t see them <br/>\nas students in preparation for life, who after a number of years and lessons <br/>\nmight be considered &quot;completed&quot; or &quot;graduated.&quot;  It was a long way to come, <br/>\nand I never even had to move.  I just had to look at what I considered to be <br/>\nreal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Desiderata was written by Max Erhmann, and for those who missed it then <br/>\nor had it then and have missed it since, here it is:<br/>\n<br/>\nDesiderata<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGo placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in <br/>\nsilence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all <br/>\npersons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly and listen to others, even the <br/>\ndull and ignorant; they too have their story. <br/>\n<br/>\nAvoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexations to the spirit. If you <br/>\ncompare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter, for always <br/>\nthere will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your <br/>\nachievements as well as your plans. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession <br/>\nin the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs, <br/>\nfor the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue <br/>\nthere is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of <br/>\nheroism. <br/>\n<br/>\nBe yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about <br/>\nlove; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is perennial as <br/>\nthe grass. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of <br/>\nyouth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do <br/>\nnot distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and <br/>\nloneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars. You <br/>\nhave a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the <br/>\nuniverse is unfolding as it should. <br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive God to be; and whatever <br/>\nyour labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with <br/>\nyour soul. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful <br/>\nworld. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy. <br/>\n<br/>\nby Max Erhmann, 1927</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67204,"nextTopicId":66878}}
