Today is a home day unti1 1pm, then go, go, go <br/>\nuntil night fall. Mary Griffith is speaking in town and I&#39;m going no matter <br/>\nwhat!!. A few weeks ago Peggy O&#39;Mara was here and illness kept us all home. <br/>\nSo my kids woke up late wanting to use the TV to watch a library video. They <br/>\nlooked at the PBS schedule and saw Caillou was on after the video finished. <br/>\nWe&#39;ve all had laryngitis and my 5 year old has it pretty bad today. They got <br/>\nto see Caillou decide what he wanted to eat and my little guy  asked to have <br/>\nthe same for breakfast. I&#39;m here next to the TV waiting for them to have <br/>\nneeds. I&#39;ve read all my emails which fills my cup. I&#39;m glad I have worked on <br/>\nmy issue to allow for more freedom for them. We are in a community with lots <br/>\nof people who believe TV is damaging to little spirits. We have a local <br/>\nWaldorf school where lots of my kids friends attend. The school has very <br/>\nstrict TV limits for families and I&#39;ve gotten caught in their web. I&#39;m <br/>\nfreeing myself, thank you again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hubby and I got to work out the problems from the night before. Really <br/>\nstupid stuff. He has a temper and does loudly loss it when he&#39;s tired. I&#39;m a <br/>\ntotal baby when yelled at... so. enough said, we will survive...<br/>\n<br/>\nFriday am we will head to the Redwood forest to help plant with the rangers. <br/>\nI&#39;m ready to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk to you all soon,<br/>\nMary H.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35208,"nextTopicId":35116}}
