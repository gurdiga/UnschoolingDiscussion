Also if it is shorter it<br/>\n&gt; tends to loosen up more than if it is longer.  You just need to keep twisting<br/>\n&gt; it each day for a few days to keep it dreaded.  Also don&#39;t wash it for a<br/>\n&gt; while.  The washing it will make it looser as well.

I&#39;ll re-twist them tomorrow and use dread-wax again. Hopefully in a week or so they&#39;ll start to &#39;lock&#39;.<br/>\nThe neighbours now think we are even more disreputable than before :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Dreadlocks","postDate":"1043974718","msgId":57287,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjMS40NDRlZjNiLjJiNmIyNDNlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":57264,"nextInTopic":57325,"prevInTime":57286,"nextInTime":57288,"topicId":57264,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/30/03 5:55:59 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
