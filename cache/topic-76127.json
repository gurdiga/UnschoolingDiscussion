Because children<br/>\nnormally start kindergarten (like pre-school in America) at 3, so many<br/>\nparents just don&#39;t see that their children could learn without an organized<br/>\nprogram.  It&#39;s not just a different mindset, it&#39;s a totally different way of<br/>\nlife!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1. Do you think unschooling/homeschooling also works for learning about<br/>\n&gt; the division of polynomials?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmmm, I went to school for 13 years, then college and I have a master&#39;s<br/>\ndegree as well.  Remind me again what polynomials are and why I&#39;d possibly<br/>\ncare!  School guarantees that you&#39;ll learn what someone else thinks you<br/>\nshould know and then forget it because you&#39;re not using it.  Unschooling<br/>\nguarantees that you may never learn anything about polynomials unless you<br/>\nneed it or care to know it, and because of that, you&#39;ll probably remember<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. Do you think unschooling is restricted to a certain age or does it<br/>\n&gt; also work with 14-year-olds?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have you told them about deschooling?  I haven&#39;t been to your website yet.<br/>\nOf course it works with 14 year olds.  But it isn&#39;t going to work instantly,<br/>\nas they&#39;ve been schooled all their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. What about the children not getting to know learning together with<br/>\n&gt; their peers? (the typical socialization question)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Socialization happens everywhere.  School, church, playgrounds, scouts,<br/>\nsports clubs, shopping, etc.  Learning to work together isn&#39;t the priority<br/>\nof schools, where children compete against each other for grades and the<br/>\nteacher&#39;s attention.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; What would you as experienced unschoolers tell a bunch of people who<br/>\n&gt; have never heard of homeschooling and live in a country where<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling is illegal?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Try using some of the ideas of unschooling and attachment parenting in your<br/>\nhome.  Do you have Sandra&#39;s article about school on your own terms<br/>\ntranslated and up on the web site?  That&#39;s an interesting take on not<br/>\nplaying the school game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I know that you (or somebody I was talking to) had once said that it<br/>\nappeared that someone in Germany was challenging the ban on homeschooling<br/>\npolitically.  Germany has worked a great deal on getting rid of many things<br/>\nthat still linger from WWII, working for cutbacks in American forces here<br/>\nand all that.

I<br/>\njust see people using the unschooling term to apply to kids of &quot;schooling&quot;<br/>\nage. But the concept can go way past being 18.

So YES, it works for all ages. Those in-between ages (6-18/22/26) are <br/>\ndoing SIMULATED learning in schools.

I&#39;m gonna answer a question with a question.<br/>\nDo people in Germany USE this math a lot?  In what occupations?  I know<br/>\nengineers & mathematicans here in Canada that never ever use all the math<br/>\npeople THINK they use.  And if they need to use it, they get a book and look<br/>\nup HOW to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what would happen if that cirriculum was not taught?  Who would notice?<br/>\nEconomic collapse?

Martial arts being a great example. Zen-based arts do not pursue<br/>\nthe learner.  If you want to learn, practice.  If you don&#39;t, leave.  I  know<br/>\nyou have Aikido in Germany.  Mastery of that particular art would be a fine<br/>\nexample of this cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we allow it in adults, but impose a different cycle on kids in desks.<br/>\n1) boredom or neutrality to ward most topics at best, 2) attend to someone<br/>\nelse&#39;s knowledge dispersal, if you can, 3) write it on a piece of paper, 4)<br/>\nre-read it later for the test (studying) 5) re-write it later on the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn &quot;Coloring Outside The Lines: Raising a Smarter Kid by Breaking All the<br/>\nRules&quot; (Publisher: Harper Collins),  Roger Schank lays out how to break the<br/>\nsitting-in-desk cycle of learning WITHIN the school.
