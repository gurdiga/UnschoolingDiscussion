God is omniscient and He <br/>\ndoes already know all that we need.  Too often people treat prayer as <br/>\nif it&#39;s some kind of magic potion.  If they just pray hard enough, <br/>\nthen maybe they will be able to change God&#39;s mind to do what they <br/>\nthink He should do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of prayer is to allign our will with God&#39;s and to deepen <br/>\nour relationship with Him.  So when something happens, we go to God, <br/>\ntalk to Him about it, tell Him how we feel.  Then we should tell Him <br/>\nthat we know He has it under control and that we trust Him to do what <br/>\nis best.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople sometimes pray for good  weather.  What they should do is talk <br/>\nto God about their plans and then ask Him to plan our day--weather <br/>\nincluded--according to His will.  We might think that an event is <br/>\nGod&#39;s will and that it could only be His will for the weather to be <br/>\nbright and sunny, but He might have better plans that can be best <br/>\naccomplished through rain. <br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Prayer is not begging.

Yes, he already knows what my needs are - but by praying, I find that I can quiet my mind - and get back to what really matters. I think it is much like meditation.  Have you ever tried praying about the neighbor who sends his kids to public school - becuase homeschooling looks too &quot;wierd&quot; to them? Or praying that somehow others that have power and control over our governement will see things in a different  light?   - It might be an interesting excercise....<br/>\n<br/>\nRespectfully,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Luz Shosie and Ned Vare <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, August 17, 2002 1:41 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: 2252 - Prayer 101<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  on 8/15/02 10:31 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Whether it&#39;s true or not is another thing altogether.  : )<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Bob <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ned announces: <br/>\n<br/>\n  Prayer is not begging.
