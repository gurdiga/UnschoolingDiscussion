So he waits and <br/>\nas they go over each part, he begins to forget how it goes all together.  In <br/>\nthe end, he is still 1st to recite it but I could see the wheels slowing down <br/>\nduring the process of waiting.

But I don&#39;t really see any &quot;bad&quot; stuff that he <br/>\n&gt; may keep to himself.  We talk about everything.  Being nearly 6 1/2, he can <br/>\n&gt; communicate wonderfully.  His K is still only a 3 hour program unlike many of <br/>\n&gt; our local schools which have switched to full day.  I don&#39;t see a whole lot <br/>\n&gt; of any negative stuff coming home because they flat out don&#39;t have any time <br/>\n&gt; for anything.  We get there at 11:30 and it takes &#39;till nearly 12:00 to get <br/>\n&gt; the 18 K&#39;s ready for the day and then they cram all the day&#39;s activities into <br/>\n&gt; the next 2 hours and then start getting packed up at 2:00 and then they are <br/>\n&gt; out the door by 2:15.  So we do have  wonderful mornings and then the rest of <br/>\n&gt; the day.  The most negative stuff is that they have no time to really do <br/>\n&gt; anything, they are rushed.  He tells me all the time that he can never say much <br/>\n&gt; cuz there&#39;s no time to listen.  He likes his teachers and so do I, we have made <br/>\n&gt; it a point to &quot;know&quot; them.  When it comes to him knowing less now than <br/>\n&gt; before, I feel that he still knows it all but hesitates to express himself because <br/>\n&gt; he knows there&#39;s no time there for individual focus.  If this had been a <br/>\n&gt; full-day program, he would never have gone.  We tried this out because I lost my <br/>\n&gt; nerve, but he is still the little guy we&#39;ve always known, he&#39;s never cried <br/>\n&gt; there or been hurt and we are there all the time.  If my 2 year old and I are <br/>\n&gt; done doing our stuff, we go over to the school early and play.  We chose this <br/>\n&gt; school because it is a Fundamental school and gives us, as parents, more say <br/>\n&gt; in his day and more parent, teacher, staff interaction.  I can&#39;t say too <br/>\n&gt; much negative stuff about it because there&#39;s not enough time for anything in a <br/>\n&gt; 3-hour day but our family never wanted to do school and we just know that we <br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t do it again, if we are lucky enough to continue living as we do, with me <br/>\n&gt; at home.  If he ever said he didn&#39;t want to go, he wouldn&#39;t.  If the school <br/>\n&gt; was killing his spirit, he was unhappy, or if it was full day, we would never <br/>\n&gt; even think about it, he just wouldn&#39;t go.  I guess we all look at like a <br/>\n&gt; 3-hour playtime, which for now, he&#39;s OK with.  I think our family life has <br/>\n&gt; suffered far more than he.  We learned a lot this year, it gave us an appreciation <br/>\n&gt; for what we had prior to school.  It gave me the strength I needed to say I <br/>\n&gt; am going to homeschool.  There are a lot of things I don&#39;t like that helped <br/>\n&gt; put me back on track, none of them I think are detrimental to him or he <br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be there at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pamela <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59925222,"authorName":"queenjane555","from":"&quot;queenjane555&quot; &lt;queenjane555@...&gt;","profile":"queenjane555","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: &quot;can&#39;t wait until Kindergarten is over!!!&quot;","postDate":"1082263370","msgId":92806,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM1dDEwYSs4cGtoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGExLjQ2YTUxYWQyLjJkYjMyNTU1QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":92804,"nextInTopic":92812,"prevInTime":92805,"nextInTime":92807,"topicId":92790,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... much ...

And in my mind, I thought, <br/>\n&quot;Maybe he will enjoy being home this whole week and won&#39;t want to go back.&quot;  <br/>\nWe&#39;ve had a wonderful week, where we did what we wanted, when we wanted, PJ&#39;s all <br/>\nday, T-Ball, Busch Gardens, games, building, art, movies, etc., etc., etc.  <br/>\nBut as the week ended, he started asking when does he &quot;have&quot; to go back and I <br/>\nsaid you don&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to.  But he keeps saying that he wants to.  If he told me <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t want to go back, he wouldn&#39;t.  But I feel like I &quot;put&quot; him there as <br/>\nI lost my nerve when K approached and now that he has formed a likeness or a <br/>\nfondness for it, it would be unfair to make yet another decision without him.  <br/>\nWe have discussed over and over about next year and he is adamant about not <br/>\ngoing again.  There&#39;s a lot he doesn&#39;t like and that&#39;s enough for his decision <br/>\nbut on top of those things, he knows he would be there all day as opposed to 3 <br/>\nhours and that he will have different teachers and most likely if we were <br/>\ngoing to continue school, he would have to go to a different one because we don&#39;t <br/>\nlike the commute to the one he is in and he was moved up on the waiting list <br/>\nfor the Fundamental school closer to us.  He doesn&#39;t go to our zoned school.  <br/>\nSo, I am certain that he will not miss it once it has been over for the Summer <br/>\nand he already knows it would be a different school and all day.  He tells me <br/>\nthat he likes to play at school and go outside but he doesn&#39;t like having to <br/>\nwait all the time, wait for recess, wait for art, wait for library day, and all <br/>\nthat.  He says he already knows everything they teach him, and that&#39;s true.  <br/>\nHe actually seems to know less now that he&#39;s been there, he knew so much <br/>\nbefore K.  Anyway, as much of a struggle as it is, I know that he is helping to <br/>\nmake this choice and I am happy for that.  When I started the homeschooling <br/>\njourney and discovered unschooling along the way, I found my path, it feels <br/>\nnatural, like a calling, I think we&#39;ve always done it actually, until K, we&#39;ve just <br/>\nnever called it by a name.  It was like an anxious child with an answer saying, <br/>\n&quot;Pick me, pick me, pick me.&quot;  And as hubby learned more and felt good about <br/>\nit and our families too, I knew that we found what we had been looking for.  <br/>\nBut in doing so, I feel like he has a right to a choice in this.  So we are here <br/>\nand soon we will be where we want to be and that&#39;s OK for now.  I just really <br/>\nhope he doesn&#39;t ask to go next year, cuz I&#39;d just fall apart.
