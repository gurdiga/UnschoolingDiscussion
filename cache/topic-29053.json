Grandma brought over a gingerbread <br/>\nhouse kit she got at Target.  It had all the pieces inside the box <br/>\nready to be put together and the frosting mix with coloring dyes as <br/>\nwell as candy.  The kids had a BLAST. They set all the pieces to make <br/>\nthe house and put frosting all over the darn thing. Then of course <br/>\nthey added way more candy then what was contained in the box! I think <br/>\nit turned out great and the kids were so pleased with their creation <br/>\nthey all wanted their picture taken next to it.  It was easy and so <br/>\nmuch fun.    Older children may prefer doing the whole baking of the <br/>\ngingerbread but my kids aged 9 and under were well pleased. <br/>\n     By the way, it tasted pretty good as well.  ;)<br/>\n <br/>\n                          Tara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29049,"nextTopicId":29059}}
