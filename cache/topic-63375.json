They&#39;re <br/>\nSURROUNDED by math! They CAN&#39;T escape it! Unschooling math does NOT look like <br/>\n&quot;schooled&quot; math---there won&#39;t necessarily be workbooks and &quot;paper math&quot;. <br/>\nUnschooling mathematics is patterns and logic and problem-solving. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo UNschool math, you need to think out loud when YOU do math. When you&#39;re <br/>\nfiguring the 15% tip, YOU should say, aloud, &quot;OK, 10% of $44 is $4.40 plus <br/>\nanother 5%---$2.20 is $6.60. OK, she was a good waitress, let&#39;s leave $7.50.&quot; <br/>\nOr if you&#39;re a 20% tipper---$4.40 and $4.40 is $8.80. Do math OUT LOUD---let <br/>\nthem SEE your gears working. Soon, YOU&#39;LL be able to see theirs! DON&#39;T make <br/>\nit a &quot;lesson&quot;, just problem-solve out loud.<br/>\n<br/>\nGas is $1.59/gallon right now. You have ten dollars. DON&#39;T ask them, just say <br/>\noutloud that you can get one, two, three, four, five---about six gallons with <br/>\nyour ten dollars. Estimation is a great tool. Who cares about &quot;remainders&quot;??? <br/>\nAfter filling ten dollars worth, then LOOK at how much you actually got! And <br/>\nremember, it&#39;s NOT a lesson!!!! It&#39;s just a interesting tidbit---to YOU!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you start &quot;sneaking&quot; things, hell! They see right through THAT! They&#39;re <br/>\nSMART! And what they&#39;re LEARNING is that YOU don&#39;t think they&#39;re smart ENOUGH <br/>\nto learn math. YOU&#39;RE handicapping them yourSELF!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ONLY way they&#39;re going to be less anxious about math is if YOU are! <br/>\n<br/>\nBuy them Zoombini&#39;s Logical Journey computer game. Zoombini&#39;s is a math game <br/>\nfor pre-readers. (Don&#39;t tell them THAT!) There are no + or - or x or &gt; signs. <br/>\nIt&#39;s about THINKING and SOLVING and PATTERNS and very HIGH levels of <br/>\nmathematics. It&#39;s alegbra and calculus for 5 year olds! And it&#39;s FUN! <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren can&#39;t help but learn arithmatic in their daily lives. It&#39;s <br/>\neverywhere. It may not LOOK like long division, but the point is NOT that it <br/>\nDOES. The point is that they GET IT. Kids will eventually come up with their <br/>\nOWN ways of subtracting large numbers quickly (which is what division <br/>\nIS!)---and if they figure it out ON THEIR OWN, they&#39;ll NEVER forget it---and <br/>\nthey&#39;ll OWN it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning multiplication tables TRULY isn&#39;t important. What&#39;s important is <br/>\nthat they can figure out how to do math &quot;their way&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt five, Duncan looked up at me one day and said, &quot;Mom, two fives is ten. <br/>\nThree fives is fifteen. Four fives is twenty.&quot; He was looking at his <br/>\ndigits---five fingers or toes on each appendage. I asked what five fives <br/>\nmight be. He struggled a minute and said, &quot; twenty-five.&quot; He was doing <br/>\nmultiplication at five years old---because he wanted to. I did NOT rush out <br/>\nand get paper and pencil to show him what it looked like on paper. I just <br/>\ntook joy in the fact that HE found joy in it!<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian is a colllege statistics and economics professor who will be <br/>\naddressing math questions at the conference this August. If you&#39;re struggling <br/>\nwith &quot;unschooling everything but math&quot;, DON&#39;T miss her!<br/>\n<br/>\nBACK OFF on teaching math. Let them DEschool what they learned in school (and <br/>\nat home) about math---that it&#39;s hard or that they&#39;re stupid---because THAT is <br/>\nwhat they&#39;ve learned! Back off. Ban the word &quot;math&quot; from your household. Let <br/>\nthem---on their own---find the joy and beauty of patterns and logic and <br/>\nproblem-solving. They can&#39;t escape it---they&#39;re surrounded by it. I promise!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd GET OVER the LD label! We ALL learn differently, but we all LEARN. At our <br/>\nown pace and in our own way. Each child is unique. Don&#39;t put yours in a box. <br/>\nStep AWAY from the box!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63415,"nextTopicId":63419}}
