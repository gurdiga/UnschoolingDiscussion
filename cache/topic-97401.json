(Or paste it in <br/>\na reply email and don&#39;t sent it until the discussion has unfolded and <br/>\nsome confusion has cleared up.)  The original poster can clarify her <br/>\nintent if the relevant parts of her posts are quoted.  It&#39;s really <br/>\ntime-consuming to go back and find the relevant part after it&#39;s been <br/>\nsent.  (Most likely, no one will do that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is just not possible to back up and understand how a reader reached <br/>\ncertain conclusions about the impression that the list makes on her <br/>\nunless the reader/replier is specific about what parts of what posts she <br/>\nwants to discuss.  Without pointing out specific passages, there is no <br/>\nway for people see specifically what someone is disagreeing with.  I can <br/>\nsay to you &quot;I interpret what was posted here last week differently than <br/>\nyou do&quot;, but I can&#39;t really go any further in discussing this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone can give a meaningful response to your concerns <br/>\nabout always letting kids make decisions unsupported (my paraphrase), <br/>\nunless you are more specific.  (I can say that it is a common <br/>\nmisperception.  People sometimes are very polarized in their thinking <br/>\nand think that if a parent resists being very controlling that then that <br/>\nparent just throws her hands up in the air and doesn&#39;t parent at all.  <br/>\nAs if &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; were the only choices.  As if you a parent who <br/>\nisn&#39;t at the hovering and controlling end of the spectrum is ignoring <br/>\nher children totally.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think Sandra said &quot;all women who are concerned about food <br/>\nquality are shrill and aggravating and need to chill&quot;  (my colorful <br/>\nparaphrase).   I think she gave an example trying to show that SOME <br/>\nparents who are focused on food issues and political causes sometimes <br/>\nput ideology first when making decisions and put their children <br/>\nsecond.   I think she is implying that the child should be more <br/>\nimportant than the ideology.  Having rules that are inflexible, for <br/>\nideological reasons, can make parenting harder and can be harder on kids <br/>\nthan we have to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n(But, if I was responding in real time, at the time it was said, I could <br/>\nrefer back to Sandra&#39;s real words and not be shoving my own <br/>\ninterpretation into her mouth.  That&#39;s gotta be annoying.)  (Although <br/>\nperhaps less annoying if I get pretty close to her intention.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nPS   One part of being specific that can be helpful is being specific <br/>\nabout ages of kids.  Advice that rings true to parents of 13 year olds <br/>\n(e.g. let them stay up and play quietly), often sounds inappropriate to <br/>\nthe parents of 3 year olds.   But one poster can write &quot;my kid likes to <br/>\ndo _____&quot; and some people reading will visualize a little kid, and some <br/>\na much bigger one.  It can be easy for us to talk past each other that <br/>\nway.  And I wish I had a specific example to give, as I think it would <br/>\nmake my point clearer.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162967824,"authorName":"Dawn Adams","from":"&quot;Dawn Adams&quot; &lt;Wishbone@...&gt;","profile":"bluenosegoddess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: peace and love (","postDate":"1091960326","msgId":97449,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDEwMWM0N2QzMSQxN2JhYmNjMCQ3NTRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQwODA3MjM0NzAxLjEyNDI5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjIwMTA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":97442,"nextInTopic":97458,"prevInTime":97447,"nextInTime":97450,"topicId":97401,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

In fact, I&#39;ll post the list policies here, because it might <br/>\nbe useful for others to be reminded:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolingDiscussion Posting Policies<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease read carefully BEFORE posting on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is our sincere wish to provide a forum for those seeking to deepen <br/>\ntheir<br/>\nunderstanding of the unschooling philosophy. The primary purpose of this<br/>\nlist is to encourage the critical examination of ideas, beliefs and<br/>\nviewpoints.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestioning of deeply-held ideas and beliefs can be very uncomfortable <br/>\nand<br/>\nsometimes responses to that process can stand in the way of people <br/>\ngetting<br/>\nwhat they need out of the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, we offer the following to help our members get the<br/>\nmost from the list:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. We suggest that you read for at least a couple of weeks before <br/>\nposting. Spend that<br/>\ntime getting a &quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members. This will help you <br/>\ndecide if this list is worth<br/>\n  your time or whether some other list might be more useful to you in <br/>\nmeeting your needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n2 Expect your beliefs to be challenged. Welcome this as an opportunity <br/>\nto<br/>\ncritically examine your own ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. When differences of opinion arise, stick to discussing ideas, not the<br/>\nperson with whom you are disagreeing.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. If you have a belief or practice that you don&#39;t want held up to <br/>\npublic<br/>\nexamination, don&#39;t post it to the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Before you hit &quot;send,&quot; consider whether your post will contribute<br/>\npositively to the unschooling discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Avoid using loaded terminology. For instance, &quot;If you have no TV<br/>\nrestrictions why don&#39;t your kids just watch TV all day?&quot; will get you <br/>\nmore<br/>\nuseful responses than, &quot;I don&#39;t see how your kids learn anything if all <br/>\nthey<br/>\never do is sit around like zombies watching unlimited TV.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n7. It is not useful to inform the list that you believe someone else is<br/>\nbeing rude or discourteous; please trust the rest of the list to <br/>\nrecognize<br/>\nrudeness for themselves. Saying, &quot;Jane was rude to me,&quot; just bogs down <br/>\nthe<br/>\nlist. It is also a waste of everyone&#39;s time when participants attempt to<br/>\ncorrect or improve other list members&#39; manners. It never works and <br/>\nalways<br/>\ndisrupts the list. Avoid<br/>\nstatements such as: &quot;Jane, here is my suggestion of how you could write <br/>\nmore<br/>\nnicely so people wouldn&#39;t think you are being rude.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Our brains automatically supply a &quot;tone&quot; to posts as we read. It can <br/>\nbe<br/>\nhelpful to imagine your best friend speaking the words you are reading, <br/>\nin<br/>\nthe gentlest, most well-meaning tone you can imagine. It is <br/>\nunacceptable to<br/>\nattack the &quot;tone&quot; of the list or to make generalizations about it. &quot;I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen on many other lists and this one is the rudest I&#39;ve seen,&quot; would be<br/>\nunacceptable. Instead, attempt to create a positive, helpful tone with <br/>\nyour<br/>\nown posts by setting the example you hope others will follow.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Envision every post and response as a dish at a potluck dinner. You <br/>\nwon&#39;t<br/>\nlove every dish at a potluck any more than you will love every poster&#39;s<br/>\nstyle of help. But a dish/post may be exactly what someone else needs. <br/>\nIf<br/>\nyou don&#39;t like a certain list member&#39;s offerings, skip them and<br/>\nleave them for others.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Read and write as clearly as you can. In casual conversation we <br/>\noften<br/>\ndon&#39;t realize how much we rely on others to fill in the gist of our<br/>\nconversation based on what they expect us to say. But here, without body<br/>\nlanguage or inflection, all we have to go on are your words and they <br/>\nshould<br/>\nsay what you mean. If you say, for example, you &quot;never&quot; do something, it<br/>\nshould not mean &quot;almost never.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOur goal is to make the list as useful as possible for those seeking to<br/>\ndeepen their understanding of the unschooling philosophy. To do that, <br/>\nall<br/>\nnew list members are initially moderated to prevent spamming and catch <br/>\nposts<br/>\nthat could disrupt the list. People will also be moderated if they <br/>\ndisrupt<br/>\nthe usefulness of the list. Potentially disruptive posts will be <br/>\nreturned<br/>\nfor revision.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have questions, please write to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingdiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingdiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: peace and love (","postDate":"1091940291","msgId":97434,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFGQTYwNUVBLUU4RjUtMTFEOC1BOTVDLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyNy40NzkyZmIyYS4yZTQ2MjZmMEBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEyNy40NzkyZmIyYS4yZTQ2MjZmMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":97401,"nextInTopic":97442,"prevInTime":97433,"nextInTime":97435,"topicId":97401,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
