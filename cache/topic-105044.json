And she sounds like a sensible kid who objects and <br/>\nresists being coerced into using her time and energy to do things in <br/>\nwhich she is completely uninterested. This is a POSITIVE trait - I hope <br/>\nyou can see it that way. She&#39;s way more mentally healthy than those <br/>\nkids who just do what they&#39;re told, go along, make the minimal effort <br/>\nto placate those in authority over them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour description of her day today sounds great - I LOVE it that you see <br/>\nthe value of your conversations. You sound like a natural-born <br/>\nunschooling family EXCEPT you have some learning to do about real <br/>\nlearning (not schooling).<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of giving you specific suggestions, I just want to encourage <br/>\nyou to browse around on Sandra&#39;s website &lt;sandradodd.com&gt; and read <br/>\nwhatever catches your fancy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, I wish you&#39;d take a break from trying to make her <br/>\n&quot;keep up&quot; or learn what she&#39;d learn in school, etc. How about just <br/>\ntaking the rest of the year off and enjoying yourselves, instead, while <br/>\nYOU learn about learning?<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;ll still learn. I guarantee it. In fact, just try to stop her! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe won&#39;t necessarily learn what is taught in school (remember, <br/>\n&quot;taught&quot; does not mean &quot;learned&quot;) but what she learns will be <br/>\nimportant, deep, lasting, and will ALSO lead eventually to all kinds of <br/>\nwonderful things like her being self-motivated, independent, <br/>\nresponsible for herself, with self-understanding far beyond those kids <br/>\nwho have been directed and micro-managed for most of their lives.  <br/>\nThere are many hidden lessons that kids learn very very well when they <br/>\nare &quot;schooled.&quot; These are lessons you probably don&#39;t want her to learn <br/>\nand don&#39;t mean to teach - &quot;learning is hard,&quot; &quot;other people know better <br/>\nthan you do what you should learn,&quot; &quot;your interests don&#39;t really <br/>\nmatter,&quot; &quot;don&#39;t trust your own inner voice,&quot; &quot;go along to get along,&quot; <br/>\n&quot;other people&#39;s judgment of you is what really counts,&quot; and on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the one thing you could do would be to find a way that you could <br/>\nwork out your schedules so that she does have the chance to be up late <br/>\nand sleep late. At LEAST let her stay up late and then nap during the <br/>\nday. Lots of our kids do that and she has a particularly good reason <br/>\nfor it - honor her needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mar 31, 2005, at 9:46 AM, greencow32766 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  Today is Thursday and<br/>\n&gt; all we&#39;ve done is those classes - along with lots of conversations<br/>\n&gt; about things in the car like religion, Terri Shiavo & brain<br/>\n&gt; functions, bird care etc.....

No problem with school really, she had very <br/>\ncaring teachers and a wonderful vision teacher that kept a close eye <br/>\non her - We pulled her out due to her self-esteem.  She was so <br/>\nunhappy, she really couldn&#39;t keep up etc, she felt like everyday she <br/>\nwas already starting off behind.  Her vision makes it hard to find <br/>\nher friends in a crowd etc... well, I could type forever about <br/>\nthat..........She is so much happier now, I feel 100% comfortable <br/>\nwith our decision to pull her out.  As I&#39;m sure most new <br/>\nhomeschoolers to, we&#39;ve tried various things trying to find out what <br/>\nwill work best for us.  We first only used internet to try to <br/>\ncontinue on what she had started in school - that didn&#39;t work, then <br/>\nwe bought several books/workbooks for each subject, that didn&#39;t work, <br/>\nwe dabbled with unschooling and she ran with her love of Japan, <br/>\nanime, manga etc... which was thrilling - it proved to me that she&#39;ll <br/>\ngive 150% with something she likes.  I&#39;m trying to as a <br/>\nparent/teacher just make things available to her that should would <br/>\nhave been learning this year in school - library books on geography, <br/>\nhistory videos, recording shows on cable about the human body etc.... <br/>\nThe thing is she won&#39;t just on her own grab a video or a library <br/>\nbook, I have to say &quot;Okay, lets watch this video&quot;  she of course <br/>\nfights me the whole time - Am I trying too much?  It&#39;s scary to think <br/>\nthis whole school year could go by and all she&#39;s really done and been <br/>\ninterested in was Japan.  With her main problem with her vision being <br/>\nlight sensitive, she&#39;s a night owl.  She&#39;s a different person at <br/>\nnight, happier, giggly, energetic, chatty etc... I can only stay up <br/>\nwith her for so long because I&#39;m lucky enough to be able to do most <br/>\nof my job from home BUT I have to be up & ready for phone calls by <br/>\n8am.  Night time would be prime time for her where she&#39;d be so open <br/>\nto things.  During the day, I fight with her to get her up, then <br/>\nshe&#39;s just grumpy all day until the sun goes down!!!!  When I have to <br/>\ngo to the office (which is at my mom & dad&#39;s house) I pack her <br/>\nbackback with stuff to do - not workbooks or anything &quot;school-like&quot; <br/>\nbut she&#39;ll manage to doze off on the couch.  She loves the computer <br/>\nand our rule is she can&#39;t get on until 5pm when all her friends get <br/>\non after they&#39;ve gotten out of school.  Sometimes I think I should <br/>\nonly let her on the computer a few times a week but I have to admit <br/>\nthat she&#39;s done more reading online than in her whole life which has <br/>\nnever come easy for her with her vision but she can read anime storys <br/>\nonline, read show spoilers online etc... and she&#39;s reading YEAH!!!!! <br/>\nso she&#39;s doing other things on the computer that are &quot;educational&quot;.  <br/>\nI just worry that we aren&#39;t doing enough.....I do take her to school <br/>\nfor chorus everyday, she&#39;s doing an art class every other week <br/>\nthrough our homeschool group and a classical composers/shakespeare <br/>\nclass through our homeschool group each week.  Today is Thursday and <br/>\nall we&#39;ve done is those classes - along with lots of conversations <br/>\nabout things in the car like religion, Terri Shiavo & brain <br/>\nfunctions, bird care etc..... Our conversations are great.  But what <br/>\nabout math, spelling, grammar, etc..... It&#39;s just scary!!!!!!!
