But that&#39;s what dogs do for their young&#39;uns...<br/>\n<br/>\nWeird story..don&#39;t know if I should share...but when my dog was a pup, almost ten years ago, he was playing with my son and jumped on his back...unfortunately he banged my son&#39;s head smack into the corner of the woodwork and we had to go have his head stitched...blood on the floor and I didn&#39;t have time to clean it up, but fully expected the dog to while we were gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, get home and the floor is still a mess, but once the dog saw our son, he cleaned it up!  I really got the feeling that he was waiting to know that my child was okay!  <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay,  I know that is anthropomorphism, but heck, it seems to fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nbe well,<br/>\nRachel Ann<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Fetteroll <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, September 29, 2002 6:21 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] help with 2 yr old, what dogs eat, what we believe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  on 9/29/02 5:52 PM, Deborah Lewis at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ddzimlew@...\">ddzimlew@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; My dog ate cat barf once but that&#39;s probably not the same thing, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our dog loves that.
