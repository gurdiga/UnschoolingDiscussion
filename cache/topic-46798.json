Health *for me* is not just about how long I&#39;ll <br/>\nlive, but about the quality of life I have right now. If I can do <br/>\nanything I set my mind to doing, and am not restricted by my body, I <br/>\nfeel great.

Whether you ever want to get it <br/>\nmeasured or not, your body (as is everyone&#39;s) is bound by whatever <br/>\nlevel you can process oxygen at, process glycogen from your cells to <br/>\nfeed your muscles, etc. We *are* biological, physical machines at the <br/>\nmost basic level. As someone who has an interest in this sort of <br/>\nthing, and as a sort of engineering geek type person, it&#39;s <br/>\ninteresting to me that there are measurable things (like Vo2Max) that <br/>\nI can improve on, that actually make a difference in how I feel, or <br/>\nhow my body will perform. As with everything else in unschooling, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t expect my interests to be your interests, or anyone else&#39;s.

Unschooling is, and always has been, the way we want to live <br/>\nour lives. It gives our kids the time to just exist, be happy, play, <br/>\nrun around. I&#39;m sure it helps their mental, emotional, and physical <br/>\nhealth as well, on many levels. Which, of course, is only one reason <br/>\nwe&#39;ve walked this path of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere we are right now is &quot;optimum&quot;.

My husband&#39;s father died at age 42 of a heart attack <br/>\n(when my DH was 7), and his brother had a heart attack at 31, so he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have the best genetics going for him.

Even if he has some congenital heart problem and <br/>\nhis diet and lifestyle choices prolong his life 10 years, or 20, <br/>\nmyself and his children will get that many more years to be with him. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe I hang around amazing people who are rarely sick, who have <br/>\n </span></blockquote>remarkable <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; lives (many of you met them this weekend).

I choose <br/>\nto hang around with other vibrant, alive, funny, happy, energetic <br/>\npeople. My assertion about &quot;most&quot; people being unhealthy had nothing <br/>\nto do with the people I hang with on a daily basis. Indeed, I <br/>\nprobably live in one of the healthiest sections of one of the <br/>\nhealthiest cities in America. I&#39;ve got 5 organic groceries within <br/>\nbiking distance of my house, and miles of biking and running and <br/>\nhiking trails surrounding us. But that doesn&#39;t mean that all the rest <br/>\nof America is healthy. I still stand by my assertion that *most* <br/>\npeople in our country are unhealthy. Like I said, if you walk into a <br/>\nshopping mall or some other random place in the middle of the U.S. <br/>\nsomewhere, what you don&#39;t see is a whole bunch of healthy, fulfilled, <br/>\nhappy people bouncing around. What you see is stressed, pallid, <br/>\nunhealthy people. Living in such a health-filled place, perhaps it&#39;s <br/>\neven more of a contrast when I go somewhere else, who knows. And <br/>\nreally, it doesn&#39;t matter to me if anyone else cares what my <br/>\ndefinition of healthy is. Like I&#39;ve said, it&#39;s what I think of when <br/>\nour family makes food choices, or activity choices. We like to be <br/>\nhealthy, we like our bodies to work in healthy ways, so we make <br/>\nhealthy choices.
