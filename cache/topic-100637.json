She too is not reading yet (just turned 9). Since my other two came out of school, after they had learned to read, she if my first real test.  Before the conference, I reminded her that some of the other older unschoolers were not reading yet either.  I knew about Holly, of course, and introduced them.  (To Sandra:  My husband, Jess and I had fun playing freeze tag with Holly and another friend. Mattie? in the pool).  I will make sure to include Roxy&#39;s name in our support system.  I think there was a good article on reading in one of the Life is Learning magazine that we received at the conference.  I am going to copy it and give it to family. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nBeth in MD  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100636,"nextTopicId":100640}}
