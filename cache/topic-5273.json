I went to the community college to take a class recently, and though I did get involved in what the teacher was asking of us, I studied my own learning style and rythms more so than following their guide so that I can be a more aware and awake Mom.<br/>\n  <br/>\nNoticing areas of disinterest in my kids, I&#39;ve questioned whether I am letting *prime learning seasons* pass us by, and with this question in mind, I payed close attention to everything.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve decided, after using myself as an example is No, I&#39;m not.<br/>\nMy spelling is not great, my grammar is annoying to some, and my on-the-spot math calculations are slow in comparison with many others...but I understand and grasp concepts concerning math and science and communication that many of my more technically gifted friends (and dh falls in there too) struggle with. I found out that I can find relevance and meaning in almost anything, and that I really LOVE people. <br/>\n <br/>\nOver the years, I have often been told that I&#39;m too &quot;abstract,&quot; and have made efforts to change some of that in order to be able to communicate with people better. It&#39;s been rewarding up to a point. I will never be a technically detailed writer, nor a concrete thinking mathematician. Never. <br/>\nMy joy is not in that, although I greatly admire people gifted in these ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, though the little stumbles are not convenient and are sometimes a little embarrassing, I wouldn&#39;t trade my &quot;gifts&quot; for someone else&#39;s. That being so, I can&#39;t exactly encourage my children to do so can I? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd Lisa, you&#39;re very right about spelling skills. Practice is the only thing that makes sense. Learning the rules and tips are useful once the desire to create a full and complete &quot;work&quot; are in place, but on their own they can be just drudgery. My oldest dd is a wonderful speller for her age, and that is only because she is interested in writing stories about sea-life and reading about whales. She hasn&#39;t learned spelling for spelling&#39;s sake.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m hoping that in coming days she&#39;ll apply this same principle to gaining her &quot;math&quot; skills... somehow gaining the more concrete and measurable skills in order to do or describe or display something that she&#39;s already interested in. Seeing that for 5 years, her interest in nature and science hasn&#39;t slowed down, I&#39;m pretty confident that we&#39;ll begin running into definable math principles at a faster and faster rate...but we&#39;ll see. :)<br/>\n <br/>\nSteph</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"McBryan Alignan","from":"McBryan Alignan &lt;clairefree@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"XhFeiPpwRrA45fvJ4DKwixKq568FwM60U1M5rj7GSfK8Ax9ZbEgr6sK8lw7bvuSTVYsBTWmISt8MYozelQJkRm2WcroZ8e7Th6qyZDaAnQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Spelling?","postDate":"945260926","msgId":5281,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNDEuNTI4MS45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5280,"nextInTopic":5282,"prevInTime":5280,"nextInTime":5282,"topicId":5273,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, My name is Diane (36) - I live in France with Jean Luc (46) and Claire (3.5).
