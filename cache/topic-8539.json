My name is Lorrie.  I am new to the list and to unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; I have three kids.  17 yo girl, 7 yo boy and a 10 month old boy.  My<br/>\n&gt; daughter is unfortunately a victim of the system.  After one year of<br/>\n&gt; ps for my 7 yo I finally had enough.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So this is my first year of homeschooling.  I gathered all kinds of<br/>\n&gt; information and read and read.  I got the scope and sequence for<br/>\n&gt; first grade and set out to meet those goals.  Well it did not take<br/>\n&gt; long to see that my son hates learning from a book and doing<br/>\n&gt; worksheets.  After many days of fighting I almost gave up.  Then I<br/>\n&gt; remembered reading about unschooling.  So here I am.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now I don&#39;t know what I am suppose to do.  My son likes not having a<br/>\n&gt; structued lesson every day but I don&#39;t feel like he&#39;s learning<br/>\n&gt; anything.  I know I can teach him through everyday life but I am now<br/>\n&gt; very confused as to what I should be teaching him at this age or how<br/>\n&gt; to go about it.  I always felt that reading was the most important<br/>\n&gt; thing.  He knows how to read but not very well.  I can&#39;t seem to find<br/>\n&gt; an approach to further his skills.  One way I can get him to read is<br/>\n&gt; having a treasure hunt however, I can not supply him with a new toy<br/>\n&gt; every day so he will read.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any suggestions as to where to start or how to proceed would be<br/>\n&gt; appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 4<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 17 May 2000 20:09:37 +0100<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Tracy@...\">Tracy@...</a>-online.co.uk&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: I like this one :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; this was sent to another list...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aleitamento.org.br/ingles/postal.htm\">http://www.aleitamento.org.br/ingles/postal.htm</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; if you like breastfeeding images, enjoy!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tracy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 5<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 17 May 2000 15:09:55 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marbleface@...\">marbleface@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Intro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 05/17/2000 5:43:00 PM !!!First Boot!!!, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Momandmore@...\">Momandmore@...</a><br/>\n&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;  Now I don&#39;t know what I am suppose to do.

Let<br/>\n&gt; him pick out whatever he likes.  Don&#39;t insist that he finish everything (do<br/>\n&gt; you finish everything you check out?  I don&#39;t.).  Talk about what he reads.<br/>\n&gt; If he wants to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I went on line and got the standards for what the ps is suppose to teach the<br/>\n&gt; kids in each grade here (not impressive but it gave me a mental health check<br/>\n&gt; and guide).  I have these vaguely in the back of my mind as a rough overall<br/>\n&gt; guide.  But day to day -- we do a lot of things on the computer -- from<br/>\n&gt; grammar to math to games.  It all counts and it all adds to his store of<br/>\n&gt; knowledge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, my 7 yo is learning (still with a lot of help) how to look things up --<br/>\n&gt; in the disctionary and computer encyclopedia and on line (his favorites so<br/>\n&gt; far -- Ask Jeeves).  That way he can investigate when he has a question.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And there are outside lessons for things he has an interest in -- it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; all have to come from me -- and thank goodness.  For example, he takes Tae<br/>\n&gt; Kwon Do and piano lessons.  If you saw me (typical Mom -- no athlete) you<br/>\n&gt; would realize I&#39;m not going to be teaching any martial arts any time soon.<br/>\n&gt; And he passed me by on the piano end of things a long time ago!  So he needs<br/>\n&gt; people who know more than I do in certain areas.

We<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have any native mammals in NZ at all, but we do have deer, pigs and so<br/>\n&gt; on in the wild, they are usually seen as pests and/or are hunted/farmed.<br/>\n&gt; Possums are a major pest here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rats and mice aren&#39;t a particular problem usually. We do have two cats which<br/>\n&gt; deal with any wild ones that might be around the house. We also keep two pet<br/>\n&gt; rats which have been a lot of fun. I wasn&#39;t keen at all but they&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; very responsive and interesting and interactive with our girls. We have had<br/>\n&gt; guineapigs in the past but they are much more timid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I had in mind when I posted about the lack of wildlife was the bigger<br/>\n&gt; animals such as wolves, bears, lions etc as we had been watching so many<br/>\n&gt; videos about these animals both in the wild and as &quot;pets&quot; or semi-tame (like<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Born Free&quot;). And I have long liked the idea of keeping turtles but here you<br/>\n&gt; buy teeny ones from the pet shop and they are *so* expensive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; New Zealand is a beautiful place and I certainly appreciate the lack of<br/>\n&gt; *dangerous* creatures here!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; Karen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Susan Friesen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nfriesen@...\">nfriesen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Karen@...\">Karen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cc: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, May 18, 2000 2:48 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Hi Karen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi Karen, I read your comments about the &quot;lack&quot; of wildlife in N.Z.

I find they<br/>\n&gt; can handle books way beyond their &quot;reading age&quot; or own reading ability but<br/>\n&gt; to stop it getting too heavy I intersperse with lighter stuff. Sometimes we<br/>\n&gt; read two or three chapter books at the same time, it keeps me from flagging<br/>\n&gt; and keeps up the interest better (we have five kids aged 3 to 10). If they<br/>\n&gt; are around when I read the newspaper and start asking questions about photos<br/>\n&gt; or headlines I read bits aloud to them. I want them to know by experience<br/>\n&gt; that reading is both fun and a way to find out things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As much as possible I let them choose what we read and because there are<br/>\n&gt; five of them we cover a lot of different ground. We also have quite a lot of<br/>\n&gt; books and stories on tape which are great in the car or for quiet times or<br/>\n&gt; for when I&#39;m not available to read to them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My 10 year old daughter is an avid reader but still enjoys being read to,<br/>\n&gt; also she is starting to share the reading aloud job. My eight year old<br/>\n&gt; daughter has the phonics basics and can sound out words but it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &quot;flow&quot; for her yet. She is starting to bring things to me more now to show<br/>\n&gt; me that she can read the title or whatever. Our attitude is that it will<br/>\n&gt; happen for her and not to stress about it. I am noticing differences between<br/>\n&gt; the two girls in that the first is very interested in stories, the second is<br/>\n&gt; more interested in finding out information that she needs for a particular<br/>\n&gt; reason.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am looking forward to hearing what others on this list will have to say in<br/>\n&gt; answer to your questions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All the best,<br/>\n&gt; Karen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;(Lorrie Pimentel)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Momandmore@...\">Momandmore@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, May 18, 2000 5:40 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Intro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello.  My name is Lorrie.  I am new to the list and to unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have three kids.  17 yo girl, 7 yo boy and a 10 month old boy.  My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; daughter is unfortunately a victim of the system.  After one year of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ps for my 7 yo I finally had enough.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So this is my first year of homeschooling.  I gathered all kinds of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; information and read and read.  I got the scope and sequence for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; first grade and set out to meet those goals.  Well it did not take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; long to see that my son hates learning from a book and doing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worksheets.  After many days of fighting I almost gave up.  Then I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; remembered reading about unschooling.  So here I am.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now I don&#39;t know what I am suppose to do.  My son likes not having a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; structued lesson every day but I don&#39;t feel like he&#39;s learning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything.  I know I can teach him through everyday life but I am now<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very confused as to what I should be teaching him at this age or how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to go about it.  I always felt that reading was the most important<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thing.  He knows how to read but not very well.  I can&#39;t seem to find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an approach to further his skills.  One way I can get him to read is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; having a treasure hunt however, I can not supply him with a new toy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; every day so he will read.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Any suggestions as to where to start or how to proceed would be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 9<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 17 May 2000 21:50:08 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: Anita Bower &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:homequaker@...\">homequaker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Intro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Welcome to unschooling, Lorrie!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You will find your way as you go along.  Trial and error is a great teacher.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son didn&#39;t do much reading until age 9. But, we read to him constantly!<br/>\n&gt; MOrning, noon and night, and in between.  Fiction, non-fiction, science<br/>\n&gt; fiction, fantasy, etc.  He is now 11, and we still read to him, morning and<br/>\n&gt; night.  We all love it! Usually my husband reads him one book, and I read<br/>\n&gt; him another, and, now that he reads regularly, he reads another.  Sometimes<br/>\n&gt; we even have a  fourth book going for family reading aloud time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We always read books on topics my son was interested in.  We use the<br/>\n&gt; library heavily.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As a result of listening to all this reading aloud, his vocabulary is<br/>\n&gt; fabulous and he has a great sense of proper grammar.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son started reading for pleasure by reading &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Garfield&quot; collections.  We have them all.  (I never anticipated spending<br/>\n&gt; money on comic collections!)  He still likes to re-read them repeatedly at<br/>\n&gt; bedtime.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How does you son learn?  Observe him and find out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son absorbs info from PBS specials like NOVA.  Tonight he watched a<br/>\n&gt; special on the Hindenbergh disaster, then came in and explained the whole<br/>\n&gt; thing to us in detail.  I was impressed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At age 7 my son loved to build with Legos, loved to pretend and tell me<br/>\n&gt; stories about his pretend characters.  I think developing the imagination<br/>\n&gt; is most important.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is a start.  Feel free to ask questions.

I just subbed to this list yesterday.  I am very<br/>\n&gt; new to homeschooling, and don&#39;t really feel like I have a &quot;niche&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; I probably have come to this in a different way from a lot of<br/>\n&gt; people.  We have a son, almost 7, with a unique combination of<br/>\n&gt; challenges and gifts.  We have tried to find the right placement for<br/>\n&gt; him in school.  There isn&#39;t one.  He learns best on his own, in his own<br/>\n&gt; time and way--which often involves climbing all over the place while<br/>\n&gt; he is learning.  Whenever he is under stress he acts out behaviorally,<br/>\n&gt; and at school he does that a lot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We were having so many problems that we met with the school and had<br/>\n&gt; him officially switched to half days.  Things seemed to be better for<br/>\n&gt; a while, and then he couldn&#39;t make the transition back to school<br/>\n&gt; after spring break.  So actually we are not even officially homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; yet, we are on &quot;home instruction&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My head is spinning!  I went from thinking about maybe homeschooling him<br/>\n&gt; next year, to having him home full time *now* without having time to<br/>\n&gt; get my bearings, develop a support network, etc.  I have found out<br/>\n&gt; where the groups are and have attended a couple of meetings.  The<br/>\n&gt; thing is, when my son was starting school, it was somebody&#39;s *job*<br/>\n&gt; to help me out, show me the ropes, etc.  Homeschooling by nature is<br/>\n&gt; a lot of people doing their own thing for their own reasons, and they<br/>\n&gt; get together and form friendships, plan activities, etc.  But there<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to be a &quot;welcoming committee&quot;   I am not saying that people<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t been nice, it is just a rough transition into uncharted territories,<br/>\n&gt; and I am really feeling &quot;on my own&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So anyway, there are lots of issues.  I was not *planning* to do this,<br/>\n&gt; but it became apparent to me that it was the only choice.  I need to<br/>\n&gt; find a way to do this and still get my own needs for solitude and self-<br/>\n&gt; determination met.  And I need a peer group.  Or something.  I also<br/>\n&gt; feel like an &quot;outsider&quot; among homeschoolers because I *do* hope that<br/>\n&gt; my other child can go to school, as I hoped that my son would.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; just that I knew when it was time to take him out for the benefit<br/>\n&gt; of everyone involved.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rambling, I guess, but also hoping that someone can relate...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Renee<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 12<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 17 May 2000 22:01:34 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Pris&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:x_t_sipr@...\">x_t_sipr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Intro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a SAHM from TX and I&#39;ve h-s&#39;d my dss (11/9) for 3 yrs ... we&#39;ve had a<br/>\n&gt; *wonderful* experience, that is, until recently, the natives are getting<br/>\n&gt; R~E~S~T~L~E~S~S ...

My name is Liz, and I just<br/>\n&gt; started this myself as well.  I haven&#39;t even started teaching my kids yet,<br/>\n&gt; that will take place next beginning in the fall.  However, I can fully<br/>\n&gt; relate to you.  When a person decides to take that step to homeschool, they<br/>\n&gt; ARE stepping into uncharted territory (at least for themselves).  I also<br/>\n&gt; thought the same thing, that there was no &quot;welcoming&quot; committee....it would<br/>\n&gt; have helped to have someone take me by the hand and &quot;show&quot; me what to do.<br/>\n&gt; But, of course, there&#39;s no such thing.  However, I have found this email<br/>\n&gt; list to be very beneficial, and things seem to be falling into place.  I get<br/>\n&gt; bits and pieces of information to put together, but basically it&#39;s a &quot;figure<br/>\n&gt; it out for yourself&quot; thing, because only you know what is best for your<br/>\n&gt; individual child.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have 4 children ages 4,5,10 and 12 that I will begin homeschooling next<br/>\n&gt; year.  I have just decided that I&#39;ve had enough of school violence.  Also my<br/>\n&gt; oldest son is ahead of his grade.  In the second grade, he could do algebra<br/>\n&gt; in his head.  He is now in the sixth grade, and after 4 years of talking to<br/>\n&gt; teachers (and others), I can&#39;t get anyone to advance and challenge him.  My<br/>\n&gt; 5 year old is NOT ready for socialization with other kids.  She thinks<br/>\n&gt; EVERYTHING should be her way.  So these are my reasons for deciding to<br/>\n&gt; homeschool, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the right choice for myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Try not to let it over-whelm you.  I&#39;ve been doing the same thing myself,<br/>\n&gt; and I find it difficult to concentrate and put things together myself when I<br/>\n&gt; stress out....I lose all focus, and make things worse.  And it&#39;s not that<br/>\n&gt; bad at all.  If you need someone to talk to, feel free to contact me.  I<br/>\n&gt; wish you all the best!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Liz<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Renee Lester &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rlester@...\">rlester@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 17, 2000 9:38 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] New Member<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi everyone.

We have a son, almost 7, with a unique combination of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; challenges and gifts.  We have tried to find the right placement for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him in school.  There isn&#39;t one.  He learns best on his own, in his own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time and way--which often involves climbing all over the place while<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he is learning.

I went from thinking about maybe homeschooling him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; next year, to having him home full time *now* without having time to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get my bearings, develop a support network, etc.  I have found out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where the groups are and have attended a couple of meetings.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thing is, when my son was starting school, it was somebody&#39;s *job*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to help me out, show me the ropes, etc.  Homeschooling by nature is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a lot of people doing their own thing for their own reasons, and they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get together and form friendships, plan activities, etc.  But there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t seem to be a &quot;welcoming committee&quot;   I am not saying that people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t been nice, it is just a rough transition into uncharted<br/>\n&gt; territories,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I am really feeling &quot;on my own&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So anyway, there are lots of issues.

I just got done reading<br/>\n&gt; the book the Relaxed Homeschool by Mary Hood.  It is excellent and<br/>\n&gt; will help you not to panic.  Since it is so close to the end of the year, I<br/>\n&gt; would jsut take the rest of the time to relax, read, play, read, and have<br/>\n&gt; fun.  The part I like best about hs my girls is having gotten to know<br/>\n&gt; them so much better than when they were in school.  Just spend time<br/>\n&gt; together.  You might want to check out eh libraries and playgrounds<br/>\n&gt; during the day to casually meet others who might be hsing.  You might<br/>\n&gt; start seeing school age kids more than you realized.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just my two cents,<br/>\n&gt; Tarla<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi everyone.

When it was time for him to enter<br/>\nkindergarten, I looked at our public school and at a private school, but I<br/>\ncould not imagine him fitting in well.  I feared he would be labelled and<br/>\nget into trouble.  Plus, he didn&#39;t want to go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike you, I was fortunate in that I had known a homeschooling family and<br/>\nhad been impressed with their approach.  Hence, the idea of homeschooling<br/>\nwas not foreign to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not opposed to his going to school.  My goal is to give enable him to<br/>\nlearn in the way that works best for him, which also seems to be your goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So actually we are not even officially homeschooling<br/>\n&gt;yet, we are on &quot;home instruction&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe this &quot;home instruction&quot; can be a transition period for you.

And, you are on your own!  It&#39;s  lot of<br/>\nresponsibility, and at first it can feel overwhelming.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s great that you have found some support groups.  Even if you feel<br/>\ndifferent, Ihope the groups can help you with homeschooling--support,<br/>\nideas, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the first years of homeschooling I found a support group that was<br/>\nmostly &quot;school at home&quot; and very Christian.  I am an agnostic and and<br/>\nunschooler, so I felt rather out of place.  But, the women were wonderful<br/>\nto me--they supported me, accepted me, gave me ideas, helped me feel part<br/>\nof the group.  I always felt different, but, I valued the support and love<br/>\nI received.<br/>\nIt took several years to find a support group that more closely met my<br/>\nneeds.  And then, after a few years it dissolved.  But, each group served<br/>\nan important purpose for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nE-mail lists have also served as a support group.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can find one other mom with whom you click, that would be a<br/>\nwonderful support for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>.  I need to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;find a way to do this and still get my own needs for solitude and self-<br/>\n&gt;determination met. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a real challenge!  I hope others on the list respond to this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hardest part about being a parent and a homeschool mom is the<br/>\ndiminution of alone time.  The main way I have dealt with  this is through<br/>\nmy wonderful husband.  He teaches at the college level and has a degree of<br/>\nflexibility in his hours.  Since our son was born 11 years ago, he has<br/>\ngiven me one day a week free to do as I please.  This is a gift I could not<br/>\nlive without.  I try to use that time to do my own activities.  At the<br/>\nmoment--gardening. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also take a nap every day and have since my son was 6 years old.  It<br/>\ngives me energy in the evenings when my son is going full steam ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep us posted on how things go with you.

I am very<br/>\n&gt; new to homeschooling, and don&#39;t really feel like I have a &quot;niche&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; I probably have come to this in a different way from a lot of<br/>\n&gt; people.  We have a son, almost 7, with a unique combination of <br/>\n&gt; challenges and gifts.  We have tried to find the right placement for<br/>\n&gt; him in school.  There isn&#39;t one.  He learns best on his own, in his own<br/>\n&gt; time and way--which often involves climbing all over the place while<br/>\n&gt; he is learning.  Whenever he is under stress he acts out behaviorally,<br/>\n&gt; and at school he does that a lot.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We were having so many problems that we met with the school and had<br/>\n&gt; him officially switched to half days.  Things seemed to be better for<br/>\n&gt; a while, and then he couldn&#39;t make the transition back to school<br/>\n&gt; after spring break.  So actually we are not even officially homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; yet, we are on &quot;home instruction&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My head is spinning!  I went from thinking about maybe homeschooling him<br/>\n&gt; next year, to having him home full time *now* without having time to<br/>\n&gt; get my bearings, develop a support network, etc.  I have found out<br/>\n&gt; where the groups are and have attended a couple of meetings.  The <br/>\n&gt; thing is, when my son was starting school, it was somebody&#39;s *job*<br/>\n&gt; to help me out, show me the ropes, etc.  Homeschooling by nature is<br/>\n&gt; a lot of people doing their own thing for their own reasons, and they<br/>\n&gt; get together and form friendships, plan activities, etc.  But there<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to be a &quot;welcoming committee&quot;   I am not saying that people<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t been nice, it is just a rough transition into uncharted territories,<br/>\n&gt; and I am really feeling &quot;on my own&quot;.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So anyway, there are lots of issues.

My name is Lorrie.  I am new to the list and to unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; I have three kids.  17 yo girl, 7 yo boy and a 10 month old boy.  My<br/>\n&gt; daughter is unfortunately a victim of the system.  After one year of<br/>\n&gt; ps for my 7 yo I finally had enough.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So this is my first year of homeschooling.  I gathered all kinds of<br/>\n&gt; information and read and read.  I got the scope and sequence for<br/>\n&gt; first grade and set out to meet those goals.  Well it did not take<br/>\n&gt; long to see that my son hates learning from a book and doing<br/>\n&gt; worksheets.  After many days of fighting I almost gave up.

Let <br/>\nhim pick out whatever he likes.  Don&#39;t insist that he finish everything (do <br/>\nyou finish everything you check out?  I don&#39;t.).  Talk about what he reads.  <br/>\nIf he wants to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI went on line and got the standards for what the ps is suppose to teach the <br/>\nkids in each grade here (not impressive but it gave me a mental health check <br/>\nand guide).  I have these vaguely in the back of my mind as a rough overall <br/>\nguide.  But day to day -- we do a lot of things on the computer -- from <br/>\ngrammar to math to games.  It all counts and it all adds to his store of <br/>\nknowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, my 7 yo is learning (still with a lot of help) how to look things up -- <br/>\nin the disctionary and computer encyclopedia and on line (his favorites so <br/>\nfar -- Ask Jeeves).  That way he can investigate when he has a question.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there are outside lessons for things he has an interest in -- it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nall have to come from me -- and thank goodness.  For example, he takes Tae <br/>\nKwon Do and piano lessons.  If you saw me (typical Mom -- no athlete) you <br/>\nwould realize I&#39;m not going to be teaching any martial arts any time soon.  <br/>\nAnd he passed me by on the piano end of things a long time ago!  So he needs <br/>\npeople who know more than I do in certain areas.  And my daughter takes dance <br/>\n-- she&#39;s younger so it&#39;s sort of a social thing too because I don&#39;t know how <br/>\nmuch she&#39;s really getting out of it but she enjoys it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you and yours will discover things you like and include what you like <br/>\nand think you&#39;d like to learn about and (it&#39;s OK) what you think he should <br/>\nlearn about.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t in any way mean, at least to me, that there is any sort <br/>\nof anti-academic atmosphere that is supposed to be happening.  Just that you <br/>\nget to choose what the content should be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut day to day structure -- what little we had -- is about to go out the <br/>\nwindow anyway as summer quickly approaches.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.  I&#39;m sure you will get it all sorted out.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111167,"nextTopicId":111112}}
