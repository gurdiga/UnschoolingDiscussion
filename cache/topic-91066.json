I was really<br/>\nhappy to read that he was speaking in this state though, because far too<br/>\nmany people do school -at -home and just don&#39;t trust that their children<br/>\nwill learn anyways.

I had Jayn<br/>\nwith me who was 3 at the time. She spent her time with me at some talks, in<br/>\nthe little kids playroom adjoining the main room (set up with crafts and<br/>\ntoys), with me hovering near the door and listening, with James (we switched<br/>\nout a bit), playing with Heather (Shyrley�s daughter) to whom she was<br/>\ninstantly attached, playing in the funshop room with either us or someone<br/>\nelse she liked, or swimming with all of us. This year she will probably swim<br/>\neven more � since she really can now. Personally I was glad to have James<br/>\nwith me to switch out (just like at home), but there were lots of parents<br/>\nthere singly with one or more kids, lots of full families, and lots of Moms<br/>\ntaking a break without their young kids. I�m sure every experience was<br/>\ndifferent, but no-one has come forward to say it wasn�t worth every penny<br/>\nand every moment. There was a real sense of community with people keeping a<br/>\ngentle eye out for any little one wandering about � but lots more freedom of<br/>\nmovement for the kids than the hotel was probably used to. I was so happy to<br/>\nbe there even if I did miss some talks and funshops due to being with Jayn.<br/>\nFor me the core of the experience is just being around the others, and<br/>\nseeing the older children (my future in a way). The chatting groups in the<br/>\nhallways, rooms and restaurants are just as valuable as the talks, IMO.<br/>\nExpect really late nights ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I&#39;m enjoying my stay.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nMy question:  There is an unschooling seminar, put on by Pat Farenga coming<br/>\nto my state. Has anyone been to one of these before?  It cost $60 and that<br/>\nis quite a bit to me.   I am very confident in unschooling so I am not<br/>\nlooking for someone to validate what I am doing.  I see learning in<br/>\neverything the kids do.  But this opportunity doesn&#39;t come to Maine very<br/>\noften.  If any of you have been to one of these, do you feel that you got a<br/>\nlot out of it besides validation for unschooling?  Any other comments anyone<br/>\nhas to offer on the seminar?  <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling@...\">unschooling@...</a><br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91126,"nextTopicId":91128}}
