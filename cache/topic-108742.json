I did find the following remark to be rather incensing<br/>\nand <br/>\nridiculously hilarious at the same time: <br/>\n<br/>\nGail Paquette, a home-schooling mother of two and the founder of the<br/>\nWeb <br/>\nsite Hometaught.com(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hometaught.com/)\">http://www.hometaught.com/)</a>, is one of<br/>\nunschooling&#39;s <br/>\nmost vocal critics. &quot;A child-led approach may develop the child&#39;s <br/>\nstrengths but does nothing to develop his weaknesses and broaden his <br/>\nhorizons,&quot; she writes. &quot;I [mostly] disagree with the premise that <br/>\nchildren can teach themselves what they want to learn, when (and if) <br/>\nthey want to learn it. Certainly children do learn some things on their<br/>\n<br/>\nown, but their often roundabout way of going at learning is not <br/>\nnecessarily the best way.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe phrase &quot;develop his weaknesses&quot; really stuck out.  Why would anyone<br/>\n<br/>\nwant to do that?  Sounds like this metaphor has children being log <br/>\nhouses that lack chinking for the gaps in their development.

It would also seem to me that it&#39;s schooled children <br/>\nwhose horizons are narrow, not the other way around.  School, as most<br/>\nof <br/>\nus know who&#39;ve experienced it, is nothing but an endless round of rote <br/>\nassignments from highly censored textbooks.  It wasn&#39;t until we <br/>\ngraduated or left school that we had more opportunity as adults to fill<br/>\n<br/>\nin the gaps that were curious blank at school.  If I drummed up the <br/>\ncourage to ask questions, I knew the ones I asked had to be properly <br/>\nphrased and filtered if I were to expect approval or to be taken <br/>\nseriously.  In other words, I knew better than to ask too many real <br/>\nquestions, ie., ones I wanted the answers to.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!

It certainly is NOT leaving kids on their own!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Indeed, given the temptations and distractions of everyday life, is it unreasonable to wonder how much kids can really learn when just left up to their own devices? Conventional wisdom tells us that when not compelled to study the basics of reading and writing and arithmetic, the average kid will fritter away the day playing video games and flipping TV stations. And while unschoolers argue that that is an unfairly pessimistic take on children&#39;s curiosity and innate abilities, it would be hard for them to deny that their approach can lead to the acquisition of idiosyncratic skills.
