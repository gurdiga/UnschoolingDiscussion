I didn&#39;t realise you didn&#39;t know about unschoolers <br/>\nin Germany, as it was a link from your page that led me to a German <br/>\nunschooling site (www.unschooling.de).

Stefanie <br/>\nMohsennia, who runs the site to which I referred, has written the <br/>\nfirst book in German about unschooling, which is also on that page. <br/>\nThere is also an organisation, called the Bundesverband Natürlich <br/>\nLernen (www.bvnl.de)and the Initiative für Selbstbestimmtes Lernen <br/>\n(Initiative for self-driven learning is the closest translation I <br/>\ncan think of). Together the BVNL and the Initiative organise <br/>\nregional and national meetings and an annual summer camp, with the <br/>\nattendance growing apace.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose that because of the HSLDA, the German-Russian Baptists <br/>\nwere well publicised, but there are a horde of other homeschoolers <br/>\nacross the whole continuum. So far the unofficial figures that I <br/>\nhave heard of range up to about 1000 homeschooled children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last two years, the BVNL has organised a meeting for <br/>\nhomeschooling experts (which includes parents, lawyers, philosophers <br/>\nand anyone interested in the issue of freedom in education). As you <br/>\ncan imagine, with such a wide range, from those homeschooling mainly <br/>\nfor religious reasons to children&#39;s rights activists who are <br/>\nskeptical about homeschooling and rather want to make all schools <br/>\ndemocratic, a la Summerhill, there were many heated discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschoolers of all ilks continue to be persecuted (and prosecuted) <br/>\nby the authorities, although many are able to slide under the radar, <br/>\nlike us at present. I expect that to change soon, as there is a new <br/>\nlaw that all immigrant children who are due to start school in the <br/>\nfollowing year must have their level of German tested and sent to <br/>\nGerman classes. This means that our five year old will soon be <br/>\ncoming to the notice of the local school, who gave us problems 2 <br/>\nyears ago about our daughter (which stopped when we said we were <br/>\nmoving away, but we didn&#39;t tell them when dh&#39;s contract was <br/>\nexteended). I was at the court case of a fellow unschooling mother a <br/>\nfew weeks back and the judge was quite sympathetic but had now <br/>\nchoice but to impose a fine, given the current state of the law.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and the Teenage Liberation Handbook is going to be published in <br/>\nGerman, hopefully by winter.

My &quot;ethics&quot; take a back seat to my desire for my  <br/>\nchildren to be safe and happy.  So far, I haven&#39;t had to make a  <br/>\nchoice between those things, but I wouldn&#39;t think long if one of my  <br/>\nchildren was about to be taken away from me.  I would compromise the  <br/>\nHECK out of life to keep that child with me.  If I had to have my  <br/>\nkids in public school to keep them, they&#39;d be in school today.   <br/>\nBecause I DO have a choice, then I make the choice that goes toward  <br/>\nkeeping them with me, which is that they don&#39;t go to school.

The standard of portfolio assessment is usually &quot;Showing Progress&quot;<br/>\nrather than an absolute stage of competence. Some states are tougher than<br/>\nothers in terms of how hard ass the assessor (if any) might be about a child<br/>\nnot *yet* reading fluently.<br/>\n <br/>\nMany people Unschooling in US states that have assessments and testing go<br/>\nthrough a kind of split personality double think process around the time of<br/>\nassessments.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of the time &quot;they&quot; just don&#39;t want to take someone to court over an<br/>\nissue that so many of the public schools are demonstrably failing at also,<br/>\nsuch as reading levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in the end, if someone is being pressured by a State official, they can<br/>\nmove to another State and comply with the Attendance Laws there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I wonder if there are statistics available for the French schools about<br/>\nthe ages of reading fluency and comprehension. I just can&#39;t believe that<br/>\nevery French schooled child would be reading fluently and fully by 9 if<br/>\nevery American, Australian, English and Canadian child is not.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Here it&#39;s not at all. Children can show lot of things they know to the<br/>\ninspectors, they can have interests in everything, they can be happy,<br/>\njoyfull, everything, if they don&#39;t know how to read at 7 or 8, it&#39;s simply<br/>\nnot possible. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the US, one of ways laws are changed is through the Judicial process -<br/>\nthe Judges&#39; interpretation become the precedents for the law. Sometimes<br/>\nlegislation passed by the representative governing bodies is challenged in<br/>\nthe courts, and gets overturned because of a higher responsibility to<br/>\ninterpret the Constitution.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the worst outcome? Would they have to institute a reading program in<br/>\ntheir homeschool? Would they be forced to engage in remedial reading lessons<br/>\nthrough a tutor? Would they be forced to send their child to school until he<br/>\nwas able to demonstrate reading ability? Or would their child be removed<br/>\nfrom their custody?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it is worth saying to your child, especially an older one, &quot;We can<br/>\nkeep these folk of our backs and comply with the law if you do a few of<br/>\nthese worksheets.

So does  <br/>\nthe learning of any individual child in school, but it doesn&#39;t show  <br/>\nbecause the report cards come on a schedule, and the semesters and  <br/>\nschool years go by the calendar.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe confidence of unschooling parents needs to come from their own  <br/>\ndeep understanding of what they want to accomplish and why.  It&#39;s  <br/>\nharder than buying a curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164790569,"authorName":"Sylvie Martin","from":"&quot;Sylvie Martin&quot; &lt;eliott2@...&gt;","profile":"sylviemartin12000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Sorry, Jeanine!

I don&#39;t see it that way at all.  If I  <br/>\nknow what kinds of things my children could use being exposed to to  <br/>\nbe more well rounded, or to &quot;fill in gaps&quot; in what they know, or to  <br/>\ntake them to another level of understanding, bringing those things up  <br/>\nin physical or conversational ways is no more &quot;manipulative&quot; than  <br/>\nbringing more fruit into the house if there hasn&#39;t been much fruit  <br/>\nconsumption lately, or bringing them bottles of water on hot summer  <br/>\ndays.  I don&#39;t need to force them to eat oranges or drink water, but  <br/>\nI can notice it might be good for them and make it appealing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people say &quot;We&#39;re not homeschooling, we&#39;re unschooling,&quot; but if  <br/>\nlegally one&#39;s choices are school enrollment or homeschooling, at that  <br/>\npoint, in that light, they are either homeschooling or truant.   <br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t *just* a method of homeschooling when people change  <br/>\ntheir entire parenting philosophies to make it work so deeply, but it  <br/>\nis a method of homeschooling when they understand it as an  <br/>\nalternative to school.    They need to be actively involved in things  <br/>\nthat bring their children into the world, and the world into their  <br/>\nchildren.  The best unschoolers are doing more with and for their  <br/>\nchildren than school-at-home families are.

Catherine has a blog for non violent education.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere, in France, yesterday, there was an unschooling family, who was at the court, because of the unschooling. They didn&#39;t hide, one of their children doesn&#39;t read at nine.. There is a trial (I&#39;m not sure about the good words)... <br/>\n<br/>\npfff.. I wish I could leave in an other country... <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to everyone on the unschooling lists, because reading all of you changed our lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish to contribute more but I just can learn everyday from your posts.. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvie (eliott le Magicien 97 - Tom le Héros 99 - Lilou la fée 02)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.webzinemaker.com/louves-online/\">http://www.webzinemaker.com/louves-online/</a><br/>\nwww.yourtes-tipis.com  <br/>\nwww.sculpture-rod.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":113099,"nextTopicId":113077}}
