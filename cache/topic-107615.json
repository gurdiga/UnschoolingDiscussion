(But I&#39;d always fess up to being   a generic nun.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone came in and said &quot;Are you Whoopi Goldberg?&quot; and I said &quot;Yes I am.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne girl was dressed as Princess Lea in the gold bikini at Jabba&#39;s place, and <br/>\nHolly pointed at her and at me and said &quot;Two Carrie Fishers!&quot; (they were <br/>\nlooking for pairs and sets, and Carrie Fisher played a nun in Jay and Silent Bob <br/>\nStrike Back).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was agreeable to anyone&#39;s good theory. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were lots of people; 40 maybe overall.   Everyone was in costume but <br/>\nthree adults (Keith got back from work really late and was our shopper/gofer for <br/>\noutings, and hid out elsetime, and another couple came by after work for a <br/>\nwhile).   The one person who had truly resisted wearing   a costume came as the <br/>\nJohn Belushi character from Animal House, in toga and laurel.   GOOD costume, <br/>\nand he wore it all night without self-consciousness.   One set of twins I <br/>\nhadn&#39;t met before, tall and 18 or so, were Darth Maul (excellent make-up--looked <br/>\nlike he had shaved his head and glued on spikes, but it was a bald wig/spike <br/>\nhead put on really well) and Obi-Wan (the middle-aged Obi-Wan, not the young or <br/>\nold one &lt;g&gt;).   Good way to be a set without looking at ALL alike.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome photos are linked from the Kirby page and there will be more later.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/kirby\">http://sandradodd.com/kirby</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI got tired of messing with them, but there will be more.
