They can REALLY let the language <br/>\nfly. LOL.  But,  I have not lost any friends over it.  Mostly because my kids <br/>\nonly use  foul language around thier immediate family.  I think they curb <br/>\nthier language in public because of going to school and getting conditioned that <br/>\nbad language is not acceptable.   Anybody who is that offended by a kids <br/>\nlanguage is pretty shallow, if you ask me.   I know it must be difficult to have to <br/>\ndeal with, I wish folks WOULD be more understanding and realize . HEY, they <br/>\nare just kids! <br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71362,"nextTopicId":71386}}
