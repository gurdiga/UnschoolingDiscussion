Adding up prices as she <br/>\nwent, so she&#39;d know how much she&#39;ll have to save to afford it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor one thing, she seems to be absorbing math by osmosis :) &quot;28+40 <br/>\nequals 68&quot; didn&#39;t even ask me if that was right. She knew it was. <br/>\nThen she said &quot;Mom, does 16 plus 16 equal 22?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was on the right track, but something was telling her it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nquite right. So I said &quot;no, it&#39;s 32. See, 6 plus 6 is 12, and 12 is <br/>\none ten and two ones&quot; and she said &quot;Oh! yeah!&quot; and went back to her <br/>\nmental math. wow. Amazing. 1) that she knew when she was right, and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to ask me 2) that she sensed when something wasn&#39;t quite <br/>\nmaking it, but didn&#39;t know why and 3) that she GRASPED IT <br/>\nimmediately! man...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother evidence of her quite superior brilliance :)...her dad is <br/>\ndoing some stretching exercises with a rope and pulley over the <br/>\nbathroom door. (Broke his arm, and is stretching the muscles near the <br/>\nshoulder as part of physical therapy)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the pulley and chord were sitting on the table. She picked it <br/>\nup and looked at it for a sec. &quot;This would be really good in the <br/>\ntreehouse&quot; LOL Sort of like the time when she was about three and <br/>\nwanted someone to get up and come see something. Her language was <br/>\nsuch that she was hard to understand, and we were kind of ignoring <br/>\nher. She went and got a ruler, placed it under my bum, and tried to <br/>\nlever me out of my seat!
