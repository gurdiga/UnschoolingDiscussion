There&#39;s something called &quot;the&quot;<br/>\ncontroversy? <br/>\n<br/>\nI must be really out of touch.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is the startling quote from that very brief article, which left<br/>\nout the in-the-world aspect of unschooling, concentrating on the domestic:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;There is nothing like the texture of kids having contact with each<br/>\nother, making friends and relating to different adults in a school<br/>\nsetting,&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing like it - that&#39;s part of the problem. School is almost nothing like<br/>\nreal life outside of school.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to be compared to the many adults and other kids they &quot;relate to&quot; while<br/>\npursuing their interests in the world....<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;texture&quot; of school - would that be sandpaper or maybe a cheesegrater or<br/>\nthe annoying itchy tag inside your collar ...  or perhaps a file to smooth<br/>\noff the bumpy individualism?<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
