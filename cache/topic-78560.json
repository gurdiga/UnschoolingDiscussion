Or is it impossible?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t been following this well so I may repeat something someone else<br/>\nsaid. There is a balance that needs to be found in my house. My kids and my<br/>\nhusband don&#39;t have the same concerns about the house as I do. I&#39;m anal about<br/>\nit. It&#39;s important for me to have my house look a certain. It makes me<br/>\nhappy. And when I&#39;m happy, I&#39;m a much better mom and wife. So it&#39;s worth it<br/>\nto me, and to all of us really, to find that balance. But it is my<br/>\nresponsibility because I&#39;m the one that it matters to. It&#39;s not fair to make<br/>\nwhat&#39;s important for me weigh down what also makes my family happy. So they<br/>\ndon&#39;t *have* anything they need to do as far as the house goes. I will ask<br/>\nthem to do something for me, and they do. I don&#39;t nag or ask meaning I only<br/>\nexpect a yes or make it so that they have no choice. I also don&#39;t ask for<br/>\ntoo much. Their rooms are their rooms and when it may seem to get<br/>\noverwhelming, my husband and I offer to help. They accept the help and the<br/>\nroom is cleaned up. They are happy and we are happy. This doesn&#39;t happen<br/>\noften, maybe a couple times a year. The rest of the house is mine to take<br/>\ncare of. I never ask for help cleaning anything, just straightening up. And<br/>\nthe help from the kids comes only for their rooms and the playroom and the<br/>\ndining room if they have been painting or creating all over the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that taking a few minutes to straighten up or clean when the kids are<br/>\nbusy is life saving for me. I don&#39;t have a cleaning schedule. I don&#39;t have<br/>\ncertain days when certain things get done. I do try and put at least one<br/>\nload of launfry in a day. That way I don&#39;t get overwhelmed with it. While<br/>\nthe kids are having breakfast and lunch is a great time for me to get things<br/>\ndone. That&#39;s usually a good half hour to vacuum and mop. Everything else can<br/>\nget done in between play and kid time. I do things right as I see them if I<br/>\ncan, make sure I put everything away right after I use it. Grabbing short<br/>\nperiods of time to clean while the kids are busy doing something on their<br/>\nown is what works for me. That way if I do get side tracked, it&#39;s not a big<br/>\ndeal or a major project I&#39;m in the middle of. About the only thing that I do<br/>\nfrom start to finish and not asked for interruptions is when I clean the<br/>\ncarpets.

If the kids are doing things that need a lot of your input, then cleaning <br/>\nall day instead of being around for them wouldn&#39;t work. Plus, they would just <br/>\ninterrupt you constantly, hehehe, right?  You wouldn&#39;t get much done anyway.  <br/>\n But if it&#39;s a day where they are really involved with stuff and don&#39;t need <br/>\nyou as much, which happens more and more as my son gets older, then it would be <br/>\na good day to polish the silver, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n Of course, sometimes I do start a project and then he wants to do something <br/>\nwith me, and because I like to finish what I start, I do ask him to wait until <br/>\nI am done.  Usually, by the time I am done, he&#39;s busy with something else.  <br/>\nOr we agree on a time, in half an hour we&#39;ll play cards, for example.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And it&#39;s hard to get motivated to keep your<br/>\nhouse clean once you get involved with what you&#39;re kids are doing. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of times, I&#39;m around, straightening up around him, so I&#39;m there, but <br/>\nnot there.  He can ask me questions, interrupt me, I am just cleaning after all, <br/>\nand, it helps him stay organized, and he can keep going with whatever he&#39;s <br/>\ninvolved in.  I really don&#39;t often get deeply involved in his projects, anyway. <br/>\nRight now we&#39;re both learning html, so there&#39;s a lot of back and forth, and <br/>\nsharing what we just learned, and it&#39;s lovely.  But most of the time we&#39;re both <br/>\npretty independent.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have routines, daily tasks to get done, and none of those things take more <br/>\nthan a few minutes at a pop.  I can straighten the whole house in 15 minutes <br/>\nbecause I do it every day( or sometimes twice a day).  Alex is really good at <br/>\ncleaning up after himself, or at least keeping the mess to one area, and that <br/>\nworks for me, I just ignore it until he&#39;s done and puts stuff away.  Sometimes <br/>\nthat takes days, ehehe, but I&#39;ve learned to let it go.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;especially when Mark gets home to it. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the hubby makes remarks about tornados, lol.  We usually just look <br/>\nat him and tell him what we were busy with all day, and then he either helps <br/>\nus clean up, or goes and &quot;hides&quot; in our room until dinner.  Our bedroom is <br/>\nbasically off limits to Alex, that&#39;s our personal space, just like his room is <br/>\nhis.  That space is always clean,  I can&#39;t stand a messy bedroom!, and he does <br/>\nspend time with us there, snuggling or whatever, but not often.  That works for <br/>\nus. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids are young, I know it can be hard to find balance, and I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink a spotless house should be a priority at that point, but as they get <br/>\nolder, things get more manageable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\n~Aimee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":144628419,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"&quot;Kelli Traaseth&quot; &lt;tktraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] how to find balance","postDate":"1060625083","msgId":78586,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWMzNjAzMyQxYTMwMDhhMCRhMjMzMTlhY0B5b3VyZ2c4N3Zxem96cT4=","referencesHeader":"PDE2Mi4yNDM5YWVlOC4yYzY3YmRlYUBhb2wuY29tPiA8M0YzNjY5QzYuNzA4MDcwNkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8MDAwNzAxYzM1ZmQxJDJlNTc5MDgwJGM5NjAxYWQzQG1hcms+"},"prevInTopic":78575,"nextInTopic":78590,"prevInTime":78585,"nextInTime":78587,"topicId":78560,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A shift in my focus has helped me.

My focus isn&#39;t to keep my house together,  its to keep my kids &quot;together&quot;.  Together meaning, psychologically &quot;together&quot;.  Them knowing that they are more important than housework.  And instead of seeing the messes all over my house, I can now see all that they are doing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLike right now in the basement:  we have an igloo started, that turned into a circle for a powwow,  we had a powwow with refreshments(breakfast), bionicle pieces all over in another section,  (Alec got some new guys and you have to combine them to make this &quot;humungous&quot; guy), fisher price cash register out with food to buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as far as balance,  I think right now the kids and their learning out weigh the house being together.  So there probably isn&#39;t one :)   And that&#39;s OK.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**I know if I had left the house I would have felt guilty all day for leaving<br/>\nit in such a state, especially when Mark gets home to it.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to do that to myself too;  wanted the house together,  kids happy,  dh happy cause the house was together.  (I thought that&#39;s what he would want) But you know what,  after lots of conversations with dh, he would much rather have a happy family than a perfect house.  Maybe you could talk with your dh about that,  maybe he isn&#39;t really bothered by it as much as you feel?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are days that I have to do some housework, like today, laundry.  Sometimes my kids understand, sometimes they don&#39;t.  But we talk about it and know that it is something that has to be done,  or else, no clean clothes!  &lt;g&gt; Which happens sometimes too and we all survived!  :)   Also, I try and be with them as I am doing things, like folding clothes by my son playing the gamecube.   Asking them if they want to help.  Sometimes they want to, sometimes they don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Julie Solich <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, August 11, 2003 1:24 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-Discussion] how to find balance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Today I have been cleaning for nearly the whole day.

Something I can really help with!<br/>\n<br/>\n6 kids, my husband and I, all living in a tiny house, I&#39;ve definately gotten <br/>\nthis down pat over the years.  <br/>\n<br/>\n#1, no, my house is not even close to spotless.  Haven&#39;t cleaned the windows <br/>\nin a long time.  But I have a few things that have worked great for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt least once every 2 to 3 months, I just get a cleaning bug and tell the <br/>\nkids to do whatever they want...watch movies, play videos, etc.  Sometimes <br/>\nthey&#39;ll go to a friend&#39;s house for the day, or even better, Chuck will take them <br/>\nsomeplace that takes all day (there&#39;s a cool hobby shop about 2 hours away they <br/>\nmake a trek to once in a while.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I start at the front door.  I take a wet rag and maybe some 409 with me, <br/>\nand (this is the key) a heavy cardboard box, a large empty laundry basket, <br/>\nand a trash can (you can put them in the middle of the room you&#39;re working in).  <br/>\nI begin moving to the right, and just sort of go along the walls of the <br/>\nhouse, (A) putting things in the basket that belong in other rooms or out in the <br/>\nshed, (B) putting things for goodwill or a garage sale in the box, and (C) trash <br/>\nin the trashcan.  I lightly wipe things down as I go, but this is more of a <br/>\ndecluttering.  Any cupboard, drawer, closet, underneath of something (like a <br/>\nbed) I come to, I go through, throwing out tons and tons of stuff that has just <br/>\nbeen collecting dust.  Sometimes this process can take an entire day, or more <br/>\n(I have known people who need a day for each room).  When the whole house is <br/>\ndone, I&#39;ll go back and do a little more soapy cleaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I don&#39;t have a really big emotional attachment to &quot;things&quot; it&#39;s not <br/>\nhard for me to get rid of a bunch of stuff.  Sometimes this process can take an <br/>\nentire day, or more (I have known people who need a day for each room).  When <br/>\nthe whole house is done, I&#39;ll go back and do a little more soapy cleaning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI learned a long time ago, when we were close friends with a couple Mennonite <br/>\nfamilies, how much of our lives are wasted on things...clutter, material <br/>\njunk, papers.  Life is too short and your children are small for a tiny fraction <br/>\nof that.  If you can go through the whole house once and really declutter, you <br/>\ncan use this same process (just with a trashbag and basket for misplaces <br/>\nstuff) once a day and be done in less than an hour, including other chores.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":135843572,"authorName":"24hrmom","from":"&quot;24hrmom&quot; &lt;24hrmom@...&gt;","profile":"learn2day2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] how to find balance","postDate":"1060613312","msgId":78573,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2QwMWMzNjAxNyRhMmI0MzgyMCQwMzAwYThjMEBUaW5rZXJiZWxsPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE2Mi4yNDM5YWVlOC4yYzY3YmRlYUBhb2wuY29tPiA8M0YzNjY5QzYuNzA4MDcwNkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8MDAwNzAxYzM1ZmQxJDJlNTc5MDgwJGM5NjAxYWQzQG1hcms+"},"prevInTopic":78569,"nextInTopic":78575,"prevInTime":78572,"nextInTime":78574,"topicId":78560,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-875460374\">&lt;&lt;It&#39;s hard not to get caught up in cleaning all the time at the expense of your kids once you get started.

Or is it impossible?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty much close to impossible!  ;-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an area I&#39;ve been fiddling around with over the last few months trying to strike a reasonable balance.  A couple of things I&#39;ve found to be the biggest help are actually behaviour shifts for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne is to just do little things as I come across them, not wait until I have &quot;the time&quot;.  For example, if I notice dried spill or something, instead of thinking &quot;oh, I&#39;ll have to remember to get that the next time I clean my room&quot;, I just take a minute to do it then.  It truly only takes a minute and makes a big difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond is not to get locked into the &quot;proper&quot; way to clean things.  If I&#39;m throwing a towel in the dirty clothes, I&#39;ll take a minute to use it to dust my dresser or wipe the bathroom counter if either of those things are messy before I toss it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong with trying to do a bit each day, whenever it seems to fit in, I find these two things help the house last longer before it needs an overhaul. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, one other thing, if I&#39;m hanging around with the kids in the kitchen, TV room, basement etc. I&#39;ll take a sec to decide if I can tidy up.  If we&#39;re chatting or watching a show I can usually tidy up at the same time.  But I won&#39;t do this if it takes away from what we&#39;re doing together.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":42924764,"authorName":"Marjorie Kirk","from":"&quot;Marjorie Kirk&quot; &lt;mkirk@...&gt;","profile":"mdlfkirk","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] how to find balance","postDate":"1060605325","msgId":78569,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDgwMWMzNjAwNSQwYTJlZDQ1MCQ2NjAxYThjMEBlbWFjaGluZT4=","referencesHeader":"PDE2Mi4yNDM5YWVlOC4yYzY3YmRlYUBhb2wuY29tPiA8M0YzNjY5QzYuNzA4MDcwNkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8MDAwNzAxYzM1ZmQxJDJlNTc5MDgwJGM5NjAxYWQzQG1hcms+"},"prevInTopic":78568,"nextInTopic":78573,"prevInTime":78568,"nextInTime":78570,"topicId":78560,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;ve been doing small<br/>\namounts each day  but I just had enough today and had to have a clean up. I<br/>\nhave felt guilty all day because I haven&#39;t spent much time with the kids but<br/>\nI know if I had left the house I would have felt guilty all day for leaving<br/>\nit in such a state, especially when Mark gets home to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard not to get caught up in cleaning all the time at the expense of<br/>\nyour kids once you get started. And it&#39;s hard to get motivated to kep your<br/>\nhouse clean once you get involved with what you&#39;re kids are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone managed to strike a balance in this area? Or is it impossible?<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
