Always have been. Ben has that MBA and has never used it (in the management sense that it was intended). <br/>\n<br/>\nDefining success is important. I LIKE what I do/have done. Ben&#39;s never been really happy at any job----military, food sales, wine & beverage business, pharmaceutical rep. They&#39;ve all been just jobs. I take my passions and play with them (and make a living at the same time).<br/>\n<br/>\nFinancially, he makes more than I do, but only because he works more hours than I do. If I kept his schedule, I could make more----but I choose not to. Even if I didn&#39;t, that doesn&#39;t matter. I do what I like to do and am happy doing it. What I do makes a difference to me and to others. Ben doesn&#39;t get that warm fuzzy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think he feels as if he&#39;s in my shadow. I think he feels he hasn&#39;t made one. He&#39;s still searching for the sun.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut success for both of us is in passion and joy and &quot;producing&quot; something.

He has a Master&#39;s degree that &quot;proves&quot; to many that he&#39;s successful. He doesn&#39;t feel that he&#39;s connected all the dots yet----he would still like to find something to do every day that makes a difference (outside of being a husband and father)---he wants a passion that can &quot;pay the bills&quot; too.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I&#39;ve supported him in each of his changes. And I&#39;m willing to do that again next month when he changes jobs again (into the Air National Guard  fulltime)----but this change is not *the* change he&#39;s looking for.

And many roadkill <br/>\n  victims are blunt trauma and hardly squashed. What about medicine fascinates <br/>\n  her? The money? The lifestyle? Most doctors DO get their hands bloody. (Not <br/>\n  my father, he&#39;s a shrink! &lt;G&gt;) <br/>\n<br/>\n  After all I doubt you get any extra consideration because your mom <br/>\n  &gt; brought roadkill home for you.

You can look at bones and how they work and how they&#39;re different from <br/>\n  animal to animal. You can put pieces under a microscope. You can see what it <br/>\n  ate for breakfast.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And if you hand in a portfolio of each detailed dissection---complete with <br/>\n  photos and drawings, it could be what GETS you into college.
