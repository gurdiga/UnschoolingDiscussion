I belong to a list with like-minded people, spiritually speaking,<br/>\n&gt;but we discuss our common beliefs and philosophies,  here I can learn about<br/>\n&gt;different ideas, experiences, and cultural practices.  I would really be <br/>\n&gt;sad<br/>\n&gt;if we no longer felt comfortable sharing these things.  It&#39;s one thing to<br/>\n&gt;read a book, but so much better to actually hear what &#39;real&#39; people do in<br/>\n&gt;their everyday lives.  Or to be able to share resources for further<br/>\n&gt;exploration into different ideologies.  Obviously even in the &#39;Christian&#39;<br/>\n&gt;culture there are extreme differences of opinion & practices, it would be<br/>\n&gt;nice to be able to share these differences with respect for one another.  I<br/>\n&gt;feel that with small exceptions, that is what takes place here.  When <br/>\n&gt;people<br/>\n&gt;immediately want to drop the subject, that does remind me of my Mother,<br/>\n&gt;kicking me under the table, reminding me to stick to safe subjects like the<br/>\n&gt;weather.  Unschooling in general is a &#39;risky&#39; subject, so it seems ironic<br/>\n&gt;that we would be afraid of other &#39;risky&#39; topics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also agree with the sentiments regarding politics, religion, and<br/>\n&gt;unschooling- they are linked whether we admit it or not.  We are in a<br/>\n&gt;situation that requires vigilance, and political action to protect the<br/>\n&gt;rights we currently have, and we need to keep these discussions alive.  <br/>\n&gt;Well<br/>\n&gt;anyway that&#39;s my opinion, offered with respect to all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cindy L.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Cindy L.","from":"&quot;Cindy L.&quot; &lt;clappin@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Ya41dhaJflNc9fmknaIOa1fE8BixE1ucKd2KEZtRfk1CWOKXkLjRygcLDZ7pW0YcFf63ernEpiq-prptSZMA7hEgZG3a3A","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Spirituality, Religion and Unschooling","postDate":"980640280","msgId":15427,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNWQwMWMwODhiZCRlOTk0OTg0MCQwMTAwMDA3ZkB3b3JrZ3JvdXA+","referencesHeader":"PGQ1LjE3NzhmNzYuMjdhMWUwODhAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15440,"prevInTime":15426,"nextInTime":15428,"topicId":15427,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just to jump in here - one of the things I really enjoy about this list is learning about other people s spiritual and/or religious practices and beliefs.
