Not writing checks means<br/>\nI pay either by cash or credit cards, or things are automatically deducted<br/>\nfrom my checking account (like car insurance and stuff).  Cash comes from<br/>\nthe ATM and appears on the bank&#39;s records the next day.  I use one credit<br/>\ncard only and pay it by internet transfer once a month.  It&#39;s recorded the<br/>\nnext day, too.  Balancing the bank account involves going on-line and<br/>\nmarking things in my checkbook.  At the end of the 2 minute session, the<br/>\nbank and I always agree.
