Siblings w/o Rivalry and How to Talk and Listen<br/>\n- I forget the title.  Also, does anyone know any good books on<br/>\nconvincing a spouse who prefers to remain stubbornly ignorant, yet at<br/>\nthe same time refuses to allow you to homeschool?  I can&#39;t imagine what<br/>\nhe would say if I told him about unschooling!!! - I just won&#39;t.  Let him<br/>\nthink we spend from 8-3 at the table doing worksheets and reports.  I&#39;ll<br/>\njust show him the paper things we do (ds loves worksheets - as long as<br/>\nhe gets to choose which ones we do and how long we spend on them).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, while I&#39;m writing...  DS (2yo) likes books with pictures - no<br/>\nmatter how difficult the words are, but no matter how written for kids<br/>\nthey are, he doesn&#39;t like them if they don&#39;t have pictures.  Fine.  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot worried.  The funny thing is, I was reading &quot;Little Men&quot; the other<br/>\nday, and laughed at the part where Mrs. Jo ties Nan up to the couch. <br/>\nMook (ds) asked what was so funny, and I proceeded to tell him the story<br/>\n- I ended up telling him the whole book.  As long as I was telling it<br/>\ninstead of reading it, he was fascinated and told DH all about the<br/>\nbook.  DH was impressed (and insisting that with ds&#39;s intelligence, it<br/>\nwould be a shame not to send him to school - grrrrr).  And, ds likes to<br/>\nmemorize books and then pretend that he&#39;s reading them in front of<br/>\npeople.  He can&#39;t read - he hasn&#39;t progressed visibly in the past half<br/>\nyear or so when he learned his alphabet and the sounds the letters<br/>\nmake.  (And, no, I&#39;m not at all worried.)  But other people ask me how I<br/>\ndo it (me?  He&#39;s the one who&#39;s learning, not me), but they don&#39;t really<br/>\nwant to know.  They just want the name of an expensive cram school. <br/>\nSad.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to go on...<br/>\n<br/>\nLove, Melanie in Japan<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
