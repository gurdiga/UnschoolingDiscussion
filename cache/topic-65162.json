The girls were just beside themselves this afternoon, <br/>\nwatching their baby sister.  These are moments I treasure that would <br/>\nbe missed had they been away at school today.

(I keep a crib in the living room so she <br/>\nhas a safe place to play without being trompled by her siblings.  <br/>\nBIG problem around here &gt;g&lt;)  I was on the computer and all of the <br/>\nsudden all my munchkins started howling for me to hurry and get in <br/>\nhere!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nChloe had pulled herself up onto her knees!  They were all so <br/>\nexcited they were screaming and there is little Chloe, just beaming <br/>\nwith the biggest wide-open-mouth grin EVER!  So, while we are all <br/>\ngushing over her, telling her what a big girl she is, she just <br/>\ndecided to pull herself up to a standing position!  She&#39;s only 6 <br/>\nmonths old!  Mind you, my other kids were, shall we say, not so <br/>\nmotorly inclined.  (If that&#39;s a word.)  Most of them were 9 months <br/>\nbefore truly sitting up on their own, much less crawling or pulling <br/>\nup.  Chloe started rocking on her hands and knees at 3 months and <br/>\ncrawling a couple of weeks ago.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, today, I guess she found her &#39;guts&#39; or something, ;), she <br/>\ndecided since she was such a big girl, she may as well get herself <br/>\nup into a sitting position from laying down.  Crazy nut!  This is <br/>\nmy &#39;baby&#39; who has never been one.  When she was 18 hours old, my <br/>\nbest friend came over to see her and Chloe just smiled and coo-ed <br/>\nand agooo-ed at her for ever.  She&#39;s been talking ever since.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe really funny thing is she is so tiny.  Just 14 pounds, loooong <br/>\nand skiinny.  It looks super funny!  And damnit, my husband is out <br/>\nof town with BOTH the digital camera AND the video camera.  I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to go buy another of each, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m off to drag out the calendar and write down another <br/>\nfirst...a whole batch of them!!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust glowing with pride and had to share.  Enjoy your babes!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65140,"nextTopicId":65055}}
