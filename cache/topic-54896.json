But most of the time it seems that kids have no chance to question it, it&#39;s a given that things are a certain way and that&#39;s it. There are no options. In that sense, there is no freedom to speak of. And if there is no freedom, there is no respect either. The disrespect becomes evident, IMO, when kids are not given options to choose how to learn things in life, because so many other things are more important than their individual process (appearances, parents&#39; desires, family traditions, cultural conformity, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I still maintain, it&#39;s the relationship that makes the difference. <br/>\nKids thrive in a place where they are loved, whether they are <br/>\nstrictly raised or more permissively raised. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren thrive where they are loved AND respected and heard, and can freely choose. If you don&#39;t give them the freedom to choose, how can you tell they&#39;re thriving?<br/>\nIt&#39;s like saying your kids love potatoes when you only give them potatoes.<br/>\nKids&#39;own nature is to love. I&#39;ve seen parents destroy even that, not because parents don&#39;t love them, but because they don&#39;t realize how suppressive their attitudes can be. So, they grow up resenting their parents and feeling guilty about it at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If you don&#39;t have your child&#39;s heart, you will never have genuine obedience.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want obedience from your kids, your thoughts may be right. If you want a more wholesome, harmonious and natural relationship, then you need to give them freedom and respect first and foremost.<br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Lotus Therapeutics -<br/>\nAyurveda, Homeopathy, Yoga & Therapeutic Massage<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com\">http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDhyanyoga Center of NC -<br/>\nMeditation - Kundalini Maha Yoga<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dyc-nc.org\">http://www.dyc-nc.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\nWhen nothing is done, nothing is left undone.

My name is Deb and I have four sons, Kris (19), Dustin (17), Adam<br/>\n(14), and Jameson (11).  I have been married to hubby for 20 years and we<br/>\nnow live in NC. I went back to school when my boys were very small and did<br/>\nundergraduate work in religious studies. I finished my graduate work in<br/>\nPrinceton where I noticed many of my professors home schooled their children<br/>\n(9 year olds frequented my Hebrew and Greek classes regularly).  I decided I<br/>\nmight try this method of education since I was home during the day most of<br/>\nthe time. My oldest was 13 at the time and had been in a Catholic school<br/>\nuntil then. Maybe I started to late with the older two because they are not<br/>\nnearly as adjusted as the younger two.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sisters always comment on my against the grain mental state and most of<br/>\nmy family considers me a renegade idealist from outer space. I tend to take<br/>\nmy multigrain liberalism to heart and look for methods of escape from<br/>\nmainstream reality daily.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am home schooling for many reasons but one thing clearly stands out in<br/>\nregard to mainstream education. This country could not sustain the model of<br/>\neconomy it does without the conformist model if education used in the<br/>\nmainstream system. The worker ant mentality sustains this country and allows<br/>\nfor 1% of mega wealth to stay in the niches it has been in for over two<br/>\nhundred years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted my children learn from loving and nurturing experiences where<br/>\nfreedom is explored in the truest sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy downfall is something I cannot identify and perhaps this is due to the<br/>\nconfusion I have with my own expectations. My two older sons 17 and 19  are<br/>\nnot sure which is end is up. I thought providing them with choices and<br/>\nunstructured learning might awaken a sense of exploration urging their<br/>\nimaginations to new heights. It seems that peers do have influence and my<br/>\nsons are moving toward a mainstream example of choice, in that, instead of<br/>\nthinking they are just doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I knew folks around here who had kids willing to take a step into an<br/>\nuncharted realm of discovery, thinking about justice and peace.<br/>\nI am in NC.

Especially the grown daughter, and the 18 <br/>\nyear old son, both of whom have had opportunities galore, to go <br/>\nhaywire, and have not done so. The 11 year old, well, she&#39;s young and <br/>\nstill staying close to home. But the son, his education has led him <br/>\nto leadership positions that require him to travel. He has been in <br/>\nWashington D.C. NOT with a chaperoned group of high schoolers, but on <br/>\nhis own, to receive an award. I think he had some friends with him, <br/>\nand probably there were other high school kids receiving this award, <br/>\ntoo (it&#39;s given out to 200 seniors in America) who were there. there <br/>\nwas stuff going on that would be defined as foolish or wrong...and he <br/>\njust wasn&#39;t interested. The kid is self-educating at this point, and <br/>\nin a couple of classes at the high school, and is doing wonderfully. <br/>\nThe other day, my friend found out AFTER the fact,that he had given a <br/>\nspeech to the mayor and some other dignitaries of her town...and she <br/>\ngot on his case about not telling her about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSure, there&#39;d be consequences if he chose foolish things, but my <br/>\npoint is, he&#39;s doing great things even when his mommy isn&#39;t looking.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace, Heidi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128307542,"authorName":"Earthmomma67@aol.com","from":"Earthmomma67@...","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Training our kids/loving our kids","postDate":"1042641379","msgId":55047,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuNzVkOTM3Yy4yYjU2Y2JlM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55046,"nextInTopic":55055,"prevInTime":55046,"nextInTime":55048,"topicId":54896,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/15/03 9:26:03 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...

They always tell me <br/>\n&quot;You must work with your kids&quot;.  I always tell them it&#39;s never work.  I don&#39;t <br/>\n&quot;teach&quot; them anything.  I also get well what curriculum do you use or what <br/>\npre-school do your kids go to?  We don&#39;t use any curriculum, nor do I intend <br/>\nto ever do that unless my kid or kids have a strong desire to do so.  They <br/>\ndon&#39;t attend pre-school and never will attend school, unless they decide they <br/>\nwant to go to school.
