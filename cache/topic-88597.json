You and your family<br/>\nare there to help that along. Getting into college isn&#39;t that hard for<br/>\nunschoolers if they want it. Who knows what he may want or need to do. There<br/>\nare so many paths he could take. College is but a small one in the grand<br/>\nscheme of _life_ learning. There are ways around most obstacles that may<br/>\ncome up. We just have to look for them and sometimes create a few. Did you<br/>\nread that John Holt interveiw/article in Mother that just went through? He<br/>\ncreated his opportunity.<br/>\n<br/>\n    This may help to think about. My oldest (18) you read about just a few<br/>\npost before. He&#39;s really a great young man. He is attending community<br/>\ncollege here and doing well. He hasn&#39;t stepped in a classroom since spring<br/>\nof 1996. We&#39;ve unschooled from that beginning. He surprised himself in his<br/>\nenglish class and really enjoyed it. So much so that he is considering<br/>\nchanging from a computer major to an english one. We&#39;ll see, he&#39;s enjoying<br/>\ntaking all different types of classes. He has a psychology class along with<br/>\nanother english this quarter that he really thinks he&#39;ll enjoy. his computer<br/>\nclasses are easy As for him. He&#39;s learned this stuff on his own. Our<br/>\nrelationship is strong and he hasn&#39;t had any trouble with anything he&#39;s done<br/>\nconsidering who *I* am. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Don&#39;t let them get you down. You don&#39;t have to justify your choices.<br/>\nYou&#39;ve already had some great responces here. It is hard to feel the hurt<br/>\nbut I&#39;ve found that that is when I grow by solidifying my beleifs. Hang in<br/>\nthere, circles of friends change many times in a lifetime.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To give an example. I remember when I got married. I sent out 100<br/>\ninvitations to family and friends. At least a third I thought would attend<br/>\nor at least acknowledge my wedding. It was a rude awakening for me. Turned<br/>\nout I had a very small intimate wedding with immediate family and couple<br/>\nfriends. Most didn&#39;t even send a card. Stuff like that has happened several<br/>\ntime over the years. Not to that magnitude but still. Friends when we<br/>\nstarted a family, Moms groups, Homeschool circles, now neighborhood friends.<br/>\nChange can be a good expansion of who you are.

Their kind of support you DON&#39;T need.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~~Do all of you have higher education and are you &quot;Gifted&quot;.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nNope, not if you mean college degrees.  And if I&#39;m &quot;gifted&quot;, it&#39;s BECAUSE of unschooling!  I used to be an ordinary parent, doing the slow dance along the school assembly line like everyone else, but now we&#39;re unschoolers.  That in itself is a gift.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll bet there are people here that had to undo a lot of their higher education in order to BE an unschooler.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFind some new people to talk to.  People that are more willing to step out of the box every once in a while.  <br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Wendy Carr&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WendyWCarr@...\">WendyWCarr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Mon, 12 Jan 2004 19:10:17 -0500<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Another question<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; OK I am on a messege board for people with small babies.
