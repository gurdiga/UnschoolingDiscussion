I was 18 to 27, and<br/>\nsingle, or at least not married.  I used to go to the Beachcombers and<br/>\nremember being amazed when they gave last call at 5:00 am or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI lived part of the time out at Cape Chiniak.  I traded caring for an<br/>\nelderly woman for living alone in a trailer on the beach.  There was no<br/>\nelectricity or running water in her house or my trailer.  Salmon ran up a<br/>\nlittle creek right through my yard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout half my years there I lived in town, the other half were a combination<br/>\nof camping in a tent, living in campers with no modern conveniences, and as<br/>\na live-in nanny.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy last few years I worked in the natural food store during the week and as<br/>\na cocktail waitress on the weekends.  The owners of the natural food store<br/>\nwere identical twin brothers.  The store sold things like vitamins and<br/>\nprotein powders so that they could afford to stock food items.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo many cool memories.  Alaska is such a fantastic place.  Every American<br/>\nshould try to get there at least once.  Of course, there are other great<br/>\nplaces too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n----- snip----- &gt; Did you ever know any Dolands or Peirces?</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Kodiak","postDate":"1049234957","msgId":62618,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5ZS4xMjhhYmM3Ny4yYmJiNjgwZEBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":62628,"prevInTime":62617,"nextInTime":62619,"topicId":62618,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/1/03 2:31:17 PM Central Standard Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-580293810\">In a message dated 4/1/03 2:31:17 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Everyone in Kodiak fished or had friends that fished,  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you ever know any Dolands or Peirces?<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.
