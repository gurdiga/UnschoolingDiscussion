I went for fifteen years.  (no kindergarten, left high school early).  <br/>\nThat&#39;s a lot of programming.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I just always believed the proof of learning was to see it written but <br/>\nthat&#39;s not true.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s one of the last blocks to fall with many people.  Even people <br/>\nwhose kids are great unschoolers and fascinating and what all, the parents <br/>\nmight want them to &quot;write a report&quot; someday.   It&#39;s as thought having a <br/>\nsolid, substantial THING that looks schoolish will make it all legitimate.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby wrote an inventory and needs report once for work.  I helped him format <br/>\nit, and found a couple of things I could mention about grammar.  He was fine <br/>\nwith that help.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t a practice report, though, as all the school reports are.  He was <br/>\nactually providing information his bosses needed about the games he was <br/>\nmanaging.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty has written up games rules.  That&#39;s technical writing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of them do a kind of writing we never had to do in school, and that is <br/>\nthe online role playing games which are run with text.  It&#39;s a little like <br/>\nD&D--there are scenarios and each character decides what to say and do.  <br/>\nThere are some online dice, but they all stay in character, and it&#39;s pretty <br/>\ndramatic and artsy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe closest we came to that in school was a short-answer test.  Even then, <br/>\nthough, you have time to proof-read and erase and change things before you <br/>\nhand it in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith these games they are writing JUST because they want to.  Nobody makes <br/>\nthem.  (Although one night Marty was on Kirby to &quot;get in there and rez some <br/>\npeople!  We can&#39;t play until you do this!&quot;  (Ressurect some, and record some <br/>\nscores, for the people in his &quot;kingdom.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey write and hit send.  It&#39;s gone.  Maybe one person sees it, or ten, or a <br/>\nhundred.  Then someone responds, based on what they wrote.  Then they write <br/>\nagain.   There is a response.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat kind of &quot;real-time&quot; writing wasn&#39;t part of any schoolwork I ever did.  I <br/>\ngot speed from taking notes in class.    So what they&#39;re doing doesn&#39;t fit on <br/>\na curriculum.  But it&#39;s better than most of the writing I remember doing in <br/>\nschool, and it&#39;s real, and live.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;She even talks using big words i haven&#39;t taught her,so i do believe there <br/>\nis learning going on all the time.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWords come several a day to kids her age.  She&#39;ll pick them up from anywhere, <br/>\nand once you&#39;ve heard a word used three or four times, you probably don&#39;t <br/>\nneed anyone to &quot;teach you&quot; what it means or how to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood, Renee!  Sounds like things are about to be even better at your house <br/>\nthan they already are.   Welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48783,"nextTopicId":48738}}
