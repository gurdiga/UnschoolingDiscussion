You have *judged* that free range eggs are<br/>\n superior to commercially produced ones.  Is that bad? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n     I am not saying we don&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t form judgements about issues.  But <br/>\nif I took this belief and then said that people who refuse to buy free range <br/>\neggs are selfish, don&#39;t care about the environment, ignorant, etc., THAT to <br/>\nme would be an uncalled for judgment.  If I feel morally superior to them <br/>\nbecause I am making a choice I believe in, that would be self righteous in my <br/>\nopinion.  Yes, there will be times that we DO do this, such as with people <br/>\nwho are doing things that are universally recognized as wrong (selling their <br/>\nchildren for drugs, for example).  But if we do it with every choice that we <br/>\ndisagree with, choices that many people have made and that are considered <br/>\nacceptable, I think it comes across as very intolerant.<br/>\n     I believe we can have a belief on an issue without judging the people <br/>\nharshly who have a different belief.  Another example...I believe it is a <br/>\ncontradiction for a person to say he/she is a Christian but believe in going <br/>\nto war.  I will delve into that belief or explain it to anyone but I am not <br/>\ngoing to make the jump to saying that people who claim to be Christian and go <br/>\nto war are hypocrites, evil, whatever.  <br/>\n     As for the statement by Jesus about the log, I believe that applies to <br/>\nmore than just a person doing the exact same sin that he&#39;s accusing his <br/>\nbrother of.  We are all filled with flaws, struggling along, doing all kinds <br/>\nof things wrong which we may not recognize at the time.  I believe the point <br/>\nof that scripture is that we should work on ourselves rather than focusing on <br/>\nwhat someone else is doing wrong.  Another similar example would be when they <br/>\ncaught the woman committing adultery and he said, &quot;Let him that is without <br/>\nsin cast the first stone.&quot;  (Didn&#39;t mean to get into a major religious thing <br/>\nhere!)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Lucy in Calif.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"marbleface@aol.com","from":"marbleface@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"0HkWzOADUJI7mLOXyk_vJX4Q9vOXvHEjsU2pVlAETKKOsfLBgmtR-2W6mRABxDvTiohjzCWb2RVv","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] working moms","postDate":"962242492","msgId":10179,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzLjc0OTQ4NDguMjY4YzAxYmNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":10166,"nextInTopic":10240,"prevInTime":10178,"nextInTime":10180,"topicId":9924,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 06/28/2000 11:18:29 PM !!!First Boot!!!, NumoAstro@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1764748403\">In a message dated 06/28/2000 11:18:29 PM !!!First Boot!!!, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NumoAstro@...\">NumoAstro@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I guess there are many different dictionaries as well...<br/>\n <br/>\n Dawn F<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which one did you use?<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NumoAstro@aol.com","from":"NumoAstro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"xLlR7c8aIa4puiqtb-VuluxYURyjEckil-62kCOZl-Lu9ivLpiPiEnTk5Pb324HLB5BYaUqg_NE","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] working moms","postDate":"962234225","msgId":10166,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc5LjYxNWM3NGUuMjY4YmUxNzFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":10159,"nextInTopic":10179,"prevInTime":10165,"nextInTime":10167,"topicId":9924,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I guess there are many different dictionaries as well...

Yet <br/>\nI am not going to condemn them for making different choices and I believe <br/>\nthat an intolerant, judgemental attitude only makes them less apt to consider <br/>\nanother point of view.<br/>\n     Certainly there are things that I consider very wrong, such as murder.  <br/>\nBut I also think about when Jesus says, &quot;Get the rafter out of your own eye <br/>\nbefore trying to get the straw out of your brother&#39;s.&quot;  I believe this is a <br/>\ngreat illustration no matter what someone&#39;s religious beliefs are.  Few of us <br/>\n(or none) are doing everything right yet we want mercy for ourselves and <br/>\njudgement for the other person.  Sadly, it&#39;s an all too human flaw.<br/>\n     I do believe that it is wise for a person to take a look at his/her <br/>\nchoices and ask whether they are in effect choosing material goods over other <br/>\nthings that have so much more value, such as time with kids.  I&#39;m not far off <br/>\nfrom your thinking in application to my personal life.  I just think that it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make us better people or better examples if we come across as being <br/>\ntoo self-righteous.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Lucy in Calif.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NumoAstro@aol.com","from":"NumoAstro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"s2oktTZysWh5PDHUrHHG0KwIMOYvlcZYk6NiJn0OfgYVrMkZ9tvjds5sVEIV3ZJtNbhyMRN9Ofs","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] working moms","postDate":"962038098","msgId":9993,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJkLjQ5YTVlNmEuMjY4OGUzNTJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":9991,"nextInTopic":10067,"prevInTime":9992,"nextInTime":9994,"topicId":9924,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Amy: Your vision sounds wonderful.

My point is that it *is<br/>\npossible* to live happily at a lower economic level than is commonly<br/>\nbelieved.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; **Not all of us are called to be self-employed.  Or work from home.  But<br/>\n </span></blockquote>can<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; only function and flourish as employees in a more traditional setting.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Would<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you say all office workers or factory workers or teachers or store<br/>\n </span></blockquote>managers<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or anyone who is not working out of their home should not have children?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Or<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; would you consider that there might be some other way to live that is<br/>\n&gt; workable for those who work outside the home?  Perhaps not the current<br/>\n&gt; structure but something in between or instead of or in addition to.  Could<br/>\n&gt; there possibly be more than one way to look at this?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I never said that all people should be self employed.  I said that it<br/>\nis an option for those who must work in order to live.  By working at home<br/>\nparents can generate an income and still be available for their children.<br/>\nMaybe it isn&#39;t where the parent is happiest, but then maybe daycare isn&#39;t<br/>\nwhere the child is happiest either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; *** Well, you may not feel or think that your opinions come across as<br/>\n </span></blockquote>harsh<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and judgemental but I can assure you that they do.

Why is your judgement the &quot;right&quot; one?  It is<br/>\nimportant to remember that everyone has beliefs, and we are all entitled to<br/>\nthose beliefs.  Your belief is not neccessarily the best one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ** There are many things, Dia, that I personally would call wrong.  On the<br/>\n&gt; other hand, there are probably many things in my life that others would<br/>\n </span></blockquote>find<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wrong.  They might even assert that my lifestyle is in some way harming my<br/>\n&gt; children.  For instance, we homeschool.  For instance, we do not go to any<br/>\n&gt; sort of church and are in fact atheists.  For instance, we watch TV.  For<br/>\n&gt; instance, we openly discuss different lifestyles.  The list goes on.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are many ways in my one little life that I could possibly be accused, by<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; right sort of person, of being wrong and doing harm to my children.<br/>\n&gt; We are all in the same boat.

And you have made this deliberate choice.

Therefore, I could say, you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>are<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;wrong.&quot;  Easy to accuse.  Not always easy to understand how the other<br/>\n </span></blockquote>person  arrived at her choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen children are relegated to full time day care while mommy and daddy are<br/>\nout fulfilling themselves, the children suffer for it, both emotionally and<br/>\neducationally.  There are quite a few studies that have shown that the best<br/>\nadjusted children, the ones who are the least likely to do drugs, wind up<br/>\npregnant, drink, or engage in other high risk behaviors, are the ones who<br/>\ncome from intact families with one parent at home.  That is substantiated<br/>\nresearch, not my opinion.  Have you ever seen research that shows that kids<br/>\nare harmed by homeschooling?  Or by not eating at McDonald&#39;s once a week?<br/>\nOr by not watching TV?  I would guess not.  You cannot compare a choice that<br/>\nharms no one (no TV) with a choice that harms someone (full time day care).<br/>\nThey are not the same thing at all!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Furthermore, if you sincerely believe that everyone should be living the<br/>\n&gt; lifestyle you describe, it occurs to me that there is no more certain way<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; drive off many people from even discussing that possibility than accusing<br/>\n&gt; them of being &quot;wrong&quot; when it comes to their parenting choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Excuse me?  Where did I say that I thought everyone should be iving the same<br/>\nway I am???  I didn&#39;t!  I stated that it is possible to live on a lower<br/>\nincome.  We took a 60% paycut in order to have this lifestyle, it was a<br/>\nchoice that has benefited our family.  My point, again, is that the vast<br/>\nmajority of working mothers could live on one income, if they wanted to.<br/>\nThey choose not to.  I think it is sad that adults are so selfish that they<br/>\nwill put their wants ahead of their children&#39;s needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We could possibly have a discussion in this country of ways to communicate<br/>\n&gt; with working moms and dads to make certain that they are aware of all of<br/>\n&gt; their choices.  We could have discussions and campaigns of all sorts that<br/>\n&gt; might truly inform and educate and broaden the horizons of all sorts of<br/>\n&gt; people.  But it would not, imo, be a success if everyone&#39;s choices and<br/>\n&gt; opinions are not respected.  We are all, presumably, adults and caring<br/>\n&gt; parents, and while we may learn from one another I do not believe we<br/>\n </span></blockquote>should<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; try to dictate to the next mom how she should live and raise her children.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do not think that we need to respect everyone&#39;s choices about how they<br/>\nraise their children. I do not respect the choice to beat small children.<br/>\nShould I?  I believe that leaving children, especially small children, in<br/>\nfull time custodial care is detrimental to them.  Why on earth would I give<br/>\ncredence to a choice that is harmful???  You have not said that you do not<br/>\nthink full time care is harmful, all you have done is attacked my<br/>\nstatements.  I am more than happy to discuss this issue, but I would like to<br/>\nsee some reasons you believe it is okay to leave children in daycare full<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nDia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Brown","from":"Brown &lt;mjcmbrwn@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"uBsVSxHaTeDuN8GMLQMtNF8nt145wguD6idxPEvfMq62cbCuwnwJSEe-AZJUC3QlthrIJk1YeNePJC3t5vhm9lC6","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] working moms","postDate":"961979614","msgId":9931,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5NTZBNERDLjc0RDREREVAaWh1Zy5jby5uej4=","referencesHeader":"PDRlLjc2MzE5ZmUuMjY4N2Y1MWRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":9926,"nextInTopic":9946,"prevInTime":9930,"nextInTime":9932,"topicId":9924,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Nance, for your reply to Dia.
