My dd \n<br>generally keeps\n<br>just about everything and her stuff has become &nbsp;too much for her. This is the \n<br>project my\n<br>friend gave her. &nbsp;She asked her first to write about her room. &nbsp;Next she is \n<br>to pack up\n<br>*everything* in her room into boxes. &nbsp;As she does this she can also throw \n<br>things away\n<br>and give away. While packing up her things my friend asked her to think about \n<br>keeping\n<br>only the things that are worthy of her.\n<br>\n<br>After she gets it all boxed she is to redesign her room - to create it the \n<br>way she would\n<br>like it to be. &nbsp;The final step is to write something about her new room.\n<br>\n<br>My 11 year old has been working on it some each day for over a week now. \n<br>She has lots of boxes packed and labeled. I think we will be putting alot of \n<br>stuff in the\n<br>attic which is a step - she can still keep the things she wants, but have a \n<br>clearer room.\n<br>\n<br>She seems to be enjoying the project and is thoughtful about what she is \n<br>doing.\n<br>I can&#39;t wait to see the finished product.\n<br>Bonnie</font></font></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16402,"nextTopicId":16406}}
