This doesn&#39;t fan the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fire of creativity!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Debra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Claire and I went to an arts and crafts get together. We went only twice.<br/>\n&gt; Each week there was a different &quot;project&quot; - making a marionette or<br/>\n&gt; working with clay....There were many different materials - seemed neat...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I spoke to the &quot;teacher&quot; after she explained about the &quot;class&quot;.  I<br/>\n&gt; explained my point of view - that it was the creative *process* that is<br/>\n&gt; interesting and important. That I was seeking something free and<br/>\n&gt; *unstructured*.  I must have been dreaming.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hung out reading a book.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The teacher took the black marker that Claire chose for her marionette,<br/>\n&gt; explained that it was dark and not good - and she began to show<br/>\n&gt; Claire how to do it - coloring almost all of the marionette as Claire<br/>\n&gt; watched.  I put my book down, and explained again to the teacher that<br/>\n&gt; it is *Claire* who is creating something in her own way.  &quot;Where is the<br/>\n&gt; problem with black&quot;, I asked?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s sad&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Really&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Yes&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;No. Claire does not see this black color as sad.  *You* see the<br/>\n&gt; black color as sad.  I like it.  Nice contrast&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I placed the black marker back within reach of Claire and said she<br/>\n&gt; was free to choose any color she wishes and that her Marionette is fine<br/>\n&gt; and beautiful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I gently recapped my ideas.  The teacher said she thoroughly understood<br/>\n&gt; my point of view, but went on to stress the importance of the<br/>\n&gt; finished product. She discussed that the *parents* were going to see<br/>\n&gt; the artwork.  She went on to tell me how much more &quot;free&quot; and &quot;open<br/>\n&gt; minded&quot; she was.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I felt as if I were talking to a tree trunk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway - I was told the following week that I could not stay - that<br/>\n&gt; no parents were permitted to stay.  Needless to say - I no longer<br/>\n&gt; wanted to stay.  Claire and I left - went to the park to breath some<br/>\n&gt; fresh air.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The pottery class that we attended months before at the same place<br/>\n&gt; (Maison du Temps Libre - House of Free Time - Ha!) had the same<br/>\n&gt; overwhelming structure and pressure.  Claire was enjoying forming<br/>\n&gt; clay into a shape, then poking and sculpting it with a tool when she<br/>\n&gt; was told to make a mobile.  Stars and moons were set in front of<br/>\n&gt; here and she was told to quickly get going - with much rush and clapping.<br/>\n&gt; She ignored the instruction, thoroughly engrossed in what she was doing.<br/>\n&gt; I mentioned she seemed to be enjoying what she was already making.<br/>\n&gt; I explained the same stuff to this teacher, once again, as I had done<br/>\n&gt; only moments early, just as I did with the other teacher.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another tree trunk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gymnastics was even worse - but a better end to a story:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The teacher explained that no parents were permitted to cross the metal<br/>\n&gt; barrier. This was unacceptable to Claire, as the &quot;class&quot; was being held<br/>\n&gt; in the other corner of a huge gymnasium.  We bowed out but I hung out<br/>\n&gt; to check out her &quot;program&quot; and to watch what was supposedly free choice<br/>\n&gt;  - using any and all of the gym equipment (one staying on the trampoline<br/>\n&gt; for as long as one wanted - and moving onto the rings if one chose to,<br/>\n&gt; for example...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The teacher sat upon a &#39;horse&#39; and had a big queen paper hat on.<br/>\n&gt; She sat upon this explaining something to all the children who sat<br/>\n&gt; around her below.  This went on for about 10 minutes.  The children<br/>\n&gt; all moved together - following the teachers instructions - back and<br/>\n&gt; forth - and then gathering around her again.  I have no idea<br/>\n&gt; what she was saying - her back was to me and she was far away...Seemed<br/>\n&gt; to me, though, that these kids did little more than listen to the Queen<br/>\n&gt; talk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In front of us, though, there was a group of boys - 6 - from ages 5 to<br/>\n&gt; about 11.  They were not sitting and listening to someone talk - they<br/>\n&gt; were *moving*. They jumped onto a &#39;horse&#39; from a spring board and flipped<br/>\n&gt; off onto a huge thick mat.  The teacher, Jean Pierre, invited Claire,<br/>\n&gt; who was watching and wanted to join in, into the line.  She did a few<br/>\n&gt; jumps and was having a ball.  They did &quot;tarzan&quot; on the rings, swinging<br/>\n&gt; out onto a huge mat. I took my shoes off and hung out by the edge of the<br/>\n&gt; mats - crossing the No Parent barrier.  The queen didn&#39;t kick me out<br/>\n&gt; and JP didn&#39;t seem to mind...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I asked later if it were possible for Claire to join the boys group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She had to be in the baby class with only children her age (3/4).<br/>\n&gt; This group - the *fun* group that *moved*, was only for boys.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve gone on much too long here - I just wanted to share that it is<br/>\n&gt; my experience that any activity (or class - or book or program or idea)<br/>\n&gt; *specifically designed for children*, often *stinks*.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seems to me that incorporating children into the real world<br/>\n&gt; - of all that we are already doing or choose to do - offers so much.<br/>\n&gt; And so, if I feel like doing pottery - or if Claire feels like doing<br/>\n&gt; some pottery - I&#39;ll get some clay and just do it.  Or take a class<br/>\n&gt; for adults and bring her with me.  She can join in without limits that<br/>\n&gt; are imposed on her simply because she is a child.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night, too, I saw a first ray of hope when Jean Luc, my husband,<br/>\n&gt; told me he did understand the no schooling thing - that he wished<br/>\n&gt; he had been free to choose to seek out freely what he wanted to know<br/>\n&gt; - and without testing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for reading my ramblings...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Diane McBryan Alignan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (Hello again, Lesley)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"megates@xxxx.xxx","from":"megates@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"LTeRCxdbCOgq5LFTrf9wtnALuaKBPKcobxV7KtYpy4_54v63CGQ3XOQBw3y6TLKGZvcSQpSu2A","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Structure","postDate":"945790611","msgId":5381,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNDcuNTM4MS45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5345,"nextInTopic":5411,"prevInTime":5380,"nextInTime":5382,"topicId":5332,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I saw a gingerbread teepee today.

I must have been dreaming.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I hung out reading a book.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The teacher took the black marker that Claire chose for her marionette,<br/>\n&gt;explained that it was dark and not good - and she began to show<br/>\n&gt;Claire how to do it - coloring almost all of the marionette as Claire<br/>\n&gt;watched.

The teacher said she thoroughly understood<br/>\n&gt;my point of view, but went on to stress the importance of the<br/>\n&gt;finished product. She discussed that the *parents* were going to see<br/>\n&gt;the artwork.  She went on to tell me how much more &quot;free&quot; and &quot;open<br/>\n&gt;minded&quot; she was.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I felt as if I were talking to a tree trunk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway - I was told the following week that I could not stay - that<br/>\n&gt;no parents were permitted to stay.  Needless to say - I no longer<br/>\n&gt;wanted to stay.

Stars and moons were set in front of<br/>\n&gt;here and she was told to quickly get going - with much rush and clapping.<br/>\n&gt;She ignored the instruction, thoroughly engrossed in what she was doing.<br/>\n&gt;I mentioned she seemed to be enjoying what she was already making.<br/>\n&gt;I explained the same stuff to this teacher, once again, as I had done<br/>\n&gt;only moments early, just as I did with the other teacher.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Another tree trunk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Gymnastics was even worse - but a better end to a story:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The teacher explained that no parents were permitted to cross the metal<br/>\n&gt;barrier. This was unacceptable to Claire, as the &quot;class&quot; was being held<br/>\n&gt;in the other corner of a huge gymnasium.  We bowed out but I hung out<br/>\n&gt;to check out her &quot;program&quot; and to watch what was supposedly free choice<br/>\n&gt; - using any and all of the gym equipment (one staying on the trampoline<br/>\n&gt;for as long as one wanted - and moving onto the rings if one chose to,<br/>\n&gt;for example...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The teacher sat upon a &#39;horse&#39; and had a big queen paper hat on.<br/>\n&gt;She sat upon this explaining something to all the children who sat<br/>\n&gt;around her below.  This went on for about 10 minutes.  The children<br/>\n&gt;all moved together - following the teachers instructions - back and<br/>\n&gt;forth - and then gathering around her again.  I have no idea<br/>\n&gt;what she was saying - her back was to me and she was far away...Seemed<br/>\n&gt;to me, though, that these kids did little more than listen to the Queen<br/>\n&gt;talk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In front of us, though, there was a group of boys - 6 - from ages 5 to<br/>\n&gt;about 11.  They were not sitting and listening to someone talk - they<br/>\n&gt;were *moving*. They jumped onto a &#39;horse&#39; from a spring board and flipped<br/>\n&gt;off onto a huge thick mat.  The teacher, Jean Pierre, invited Claire,<br/>\n&gt;who was watching and wanted to join in, into the line.  She did a few<br/>\n&gt;jumps and was having a ball.  They did &quot;tarzan&quot; on the rings, swinging<br/>\n&gt;out onto a huge mat. I took my shoes off and hung out by the edge of the<br/>\n&gt;mats - crossing the No Parent barrier.  The queen didn&#39;t kick me out<br/>\n&gt;and JP didn&#39;t seem to mind...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I asked later if it were possible for Claire to join the boys group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;No way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;She had to be in the baby class with only children her age (3/4).<br/>\n&gt;This group - the *fun* group that *moved*, was only for boys.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve gone on much too long here - I just wanted to share that it is<br/>\n&gt;my experience that any activity (or class - or book or program or idea)<br/>\n&gt;*specifically designed for children*, often *stinks*.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It seems to me that incorporating children into the real world<br/>\n&gt;- of all that we are already doing or choose to do - offers so much.<br/>\n&gt;And so, if I feel like doing pottery - or if Claire feels like doing<br/>\n&gt;some pottery - I&#39;ll get some clay and just do it.

Now &quot;retired&quot;--ha ha!  Our <br/>\nlocal home schooling group has learning afternoons on Wednesday.  The French, <br/>\nGerman and art classes are taught by moms in the group and the science <br/>\nclasses taught by a woman who gives science enrichment classes to various <br/>\ngroups.  The science teacher has &quot;learned&quot; from our group, I think, and has <br/>\nreally changed her style since the beginning of the year.  All of the <br/>\nteachers welcome the moms in their classes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m teaching two French classes, one for pre-school and one for about age <br/>\neight and up.  The moms who stay in the younger class are such a joy and an <br/>\nenormous help in encouraging the children.  I can&#39;t imagine this group now <br/>\nwithout them. I&#39;ve taught young children in many different situations in the <br/>\npast, but this is our first year of home schooling and I had no idea what to <br/>\nexpect of these children and was REALLY nervous at the beginning.
