(The one w. Errol Flynn.)  To me, Robin Hood is just about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the most inspiring character in all of English literature.  How much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the tales about Robin Hood are true?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Very little!  There is some documentation for a Robin of Locksley (don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know how to spell it).  Richard is usually made out to be a better<br/>\n&gt; king than he is while John is made out to be a worse king than he was.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Richard basically viewed England as a treasury to finance his various<br/>\n&gt; wars in France and other places.  John genuinely did care for England<br/>\n&gt; but he was a very bad king who ended up losing most of his family&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; French posessions.  Henry II (their father) held more of France<br/>\n&gt; in vassalage than the King of France did!  They were a fascinating<br/>\n&gt; family - I read Alison Weir&#39;s biography _Eleanor of Aquitaine_ recently.<br/>\n&gt; No mention of a Robin Hood there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The common people were treated horribly by the nobility so he is<br/>\n&gt; probably as historic as Arthur is!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cindy Ferguson<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
