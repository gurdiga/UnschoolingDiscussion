We have an electric heat pump - and usually its not that bad - but the last couple months have been really cold ( I am envying those of you in warm places ;-) so we had a really large bill. When they heard me talking about possible getting an insert for our fireplace to save on this they wanted to know how much the electric bill was. When I told them I explained how it all matters - lights, hot water, heat, etc. and things that we can all do to cut it back a little. It won&#39;t get tremendously better - but often there are little things, like we forget the playroom lights and stuff. So it opened up a conversation about that and all the other things we pay for like water that is by usage and how much it costs for the mortgage, etc. I think that large of an amount money to them is hard to comprehend. I also share what we save.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for fun, we save change in a big jar for our vacation each summer. We cash it in once a year and then use it for fun things on our trip.

At one point my son was able to buy a rescue hero jeep and man with his money that he had been wanting. I think they had like $10.00 on it or something. He was proud of himself at being able to buy it with his own money.  But it was short lived. If I remind home of how good he felt the day that he went back and bought it - he doesn&#39;t seem to want to do that over the instant purchase. It was kind of fluky that he saved it that time. I don&#39;t think we had gotten out as much because of bad weather and other plans.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut overall - I guess if he wants something larger bad enough at some point he will decide to just do it.

So, yeah, for sure, with the <br/>\nhelp of a newly-aware parent and a lot of honesty and openness about <br/>\nhow she is working on herself, too? Absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like the phrase unconditional love - because that has some sort <br/>\nof connotation of not even &quot;caring&quot; what my kids do - and it just seems <br/>\nlike something different than what we mean, here.

I&#39;ve <br/>\nseen advice given to mothers of tiny babies to stop them from squirming <br/>\nduring diaper changes by whipping them with fishing line and, at the <br/>\nsame time, looking into their eyes and smiling and cooing that they <br/>\nlove them.

There are things I wish I could have gotten <br/>\nmy kids, but because we were always really honest with them it was <br/>\nunderstandable all the way around.  And there were a few things they got and didn&#39;t <br/>\nappreciate (Holly, a scooter she hardly ever rode/rides) that stirred the old <br/>\nvoices in me that wanted to give them the speech about how much others don&#39;t have <br/>\nand how ungrateful, blah blah, but I REALLY try to keep those things to <br/>\nmyself, though occasionally a squeak of it comes out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a mom who could, with a straight face (which came from not thinking <br/>\nabout it past the surface) tell me with a cigarette in one hand and a beer in the <br/>\nother that she/they couldn&#39;t afford to get me whatever $4 or $10 thing I was <br/>\nrequesting.   My allowance went from 35 cents to $5 over the course of seven <br/>\nyears or so (the $5 a week was when I was 17 and in college), and my dad <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t let me get a job.  It would look like he couldn&#39;t afford to provide for me. <br/>\n But my mom was making sure I wasn&#39;t much provided for.  Altogether, that was <br/>\na big drag.  (When I went away to college I got work study jobs, at least, on <br/>\ncampus.)  So I know personally what scarcity and resentment feel like.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I became pregnant with Kirby (a surprise at the time), I&#39;ve really <br/>\n[fishing for a word, and rejecting &#39;studied&#39; and &#39;worked&#39;]...   <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the time I knew I was going to have a baby, I dedicated myself to <br/>\novercoming my childhood problems and getting clear enough about what was important <br/>\nand what wasn&#39;t so that my child would have a nest free of the trickle-down <br/>\neffects of my being a child of an alcoholic, and (I had hoped)  free of the <br/>\neffects of the discouraging voices people can keep in their heads.  I didn&#39;t mind <br/>\nencouraging tapes playing in my head, from people who had thought I WAS capable <br/>\nand fun, but the negative loops and the insults I had endured and collected <br/>\nas a kid were categorized as &quot;toxic&quot; and to be cleaned up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might not seem like messages from grandmothers and aunts and teachers and <br/>\nfriends would affect how people spend money, or don&#39;t, but they can strike at <br/>\nthe very core of whether one feels worth $5, or $50, or whether one is <br/>\ncompetent to ask for more money, or to sign a contract that puts one in debt, or to <br/>\ninvest.  All that can have to do with self esteem and self worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why money problems are so often the source of marital discord, I <br/>\nthink, and why counselling can help.  Money issues are rarely cleanly about money.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had friends whose parents used money as reward and punishment.   Kid was <br/>\ngood all year?  &quot;Christmas bonus.&quot;  One family I know, that was as clearly <br/>\nshown as if they&#39;d put coal in the stockings.  The kids didn&#39;t get equal amounts <br/>\nof money at holidays.  Teens, young adults.  And it wasn&#39;t about need, or <br/>\nage, it was about who did what the parents said to do better that year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the principles we have tried to  maintain with our children is that <br/>\nthey not feel needy or deprived.  Their clothes aren&#39;t all new or expensive, but <br/>\nthey have enough clothes that every day they  have a choice of what to wear.  <br/>\nThey have extra shoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Holly bought herself a used pair of shoes.  I&#39;ll buy her laces <br/>\ntoday or tomorrow.  Yesterday I bought Kirby a coat, used at a re-sale shop, for <br/>\n$30.  That&#39;s the first coat I&#39;ve bought him since the one he outgrew when he <br/>\nwas 12 or 13.  But he has always had a coat, even though it came from his dad, <br/>\nor was the one I found near a dumpster.  Somewhere in there, they didn&#39;t feel <br/>\ndeprived.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe paid them off, but we paid them in attention and freedom and positive <br/>\nregard.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, kind of like the not forcing foods thing, we didn&#39;t force them to wear <br/>\nclothes they hated.  I never thought of that until just now.  Because they were <br/>\nfree to say, &quot;No, this one&#39;s uncomfortable,&quot; or &quot;these shoes hurt&quot; or &quot;I just <br/>\ndon&#39;t like this shirt for some reason,&quot; clothes weren&#39;t charged with IMPORT <br/>\nor emotion or hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s an article I wrote about ideas concerning spoiled kids and money.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think it needs to cost a lot of money to be generous with kids.  Parents <br/>\nof any means can be generous or stingy, because those have more to do (I <br/>\nthink) with the emotions surrounding how one says &quot;can&#39;t afford it&quot; or &quot;I wish I <br/>\ncould.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spoiled\">http://sandradodd.com/spoiled</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand another one, related I think:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/repect\">http://sandradodd.com/repect</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s called &quot;How to Raise a Respected Child,&quot; and the shortest summary is <br/>\n&quot;Respect them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":119215859,"authorName":"Pamale Teitelbaum","from":"Pamale Teitelbaum &lt;pamelateitelbaum@...&gt;","profile":"pamelateitelbaum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Money Management","postDate":"1108035398","msgId":103283,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMjEwMTEzNjM4LjQxNzEucW1haWxAd2ViMzA0MTAubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGN1ZHBxbCs1MjRoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":103281,"nextInTopic":103291,"prevInTime":103282,"nextInTime":103284,"topicId":103217,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I wouldn t be uncomfortable ...

She also loved stuffed animals, Beanie<br/>\nBabies, Pokemon cards. She never met a store she couldn&#39;t find something to<br/>\nbuy in ;-) So her money was always leaking out on smaller things. Her list<br/>\nof wants was huge so even if she had a big chunk of money it couldn&#39;t buy<br/>\neverything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI helped her out what felt to me like fairly often but probably felt to her<br/>\nlike hardly ever since she seemed to focus so much on right now.

In other words, there are no tantrum fits or anything if we can&#39;t buy it all. I think the crux of this on my end is money. And this could very well, be why I am so worried about it all. Working within our budget is not always easy. I think I am stressed at not having enough at the end of the week. Maybe sitting down and making a list beforehand and saying &quot;Ok, pick one or two things you&#39;d like to get&quot; would work better. It doesn&#39;t seem like it would be a big deal if they asked for a candy bar - but it all adds up when it is constant. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --We still have game pieces to games my kids had when they were VERY small, because when we finished playing a game, I always helped them put the game away.

Because I made an effort to take care of things and to help them keep their parts and pieces safe and together, they did it for my things and each others&#39; things (and still do).--<br/>\n<br/>\n  That is a really good - I think I don&#39;t do this enough.

I realize that logically if they had everything they wanted, they would not feel deprived. But how much is enough? Does it become a habit if we buy  candy every time we go to the grocery store, or the convienent store for milk - is it then expected every time?  And if  kids don&#39;t expect it every time is it because they know if they ask they will get it.?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

We go out every<br/>\nyear for Chinese New Year.  There are tons of small<br/>\ntrinket stores that sell first edition and limited<br/>\nedition yug-i-oh cards.

I put forth that giving him<br/>\nthe freedom to spend $ would help him understand the<br/>\nprocess (in a way that makes sense for him) and that<br/>\ntrying to control him would make him feel denied and<br/>\ndeprived, but dh wasn&#39;t hearing it.

We have been giving our kids an allowance for about 9 months now. I was hoping that giving them their own money would help them learn to save up and buy something they wanted themselves.  I also was getting really tired of constant begging for things. I understand that when we go into a store, we want things - and I certainly bought many treats and things (actually my husband felt I did this too much - and that was the reason for the continual begging). I don&#39;t know - but they all seem to have a disregard for their stuff no matter how much they like it, or how expensive it is. I also have personal problems with continual buying just for the sake of it. Having so many toys and dollar store type items that they break in a day or so seems so wasteful. I am not saying that once in a while this is a bad thing, but when it becomes every time we got to the store it bothers me. I keep thinking &quot;Geez - we have so much stuff at home! and no one takes care of it!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now I thought having their own money and having to make their own choices about it would help. They choose more often than not to spend all of it right away on candy or stuffed animals. I was hoping that this would wear off, and they would start to see that when they see something that is like $10 it is attainable in a couple weeks if they save. I explain this, and they seem to agree and then on the way out they will buy candy - or put money in those machines with the plastic bubbles. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven with gift cards, instead of buying one or two well made, or higher priced items that they seem to really want - it seems that it is quantity they want. I suppose I could look at this a type of money management - getting as many things as possible for one price ;-) but I am of the mindset that generally you get what you pay for with things.  And inevitably the candy is gone, the cheap toys are broken and they are left with nothing. I have such a hard time with the sadness that inevitably happens when something cheap breaks and it usually happens relatively quickly. I would think that they would figure this out and the next five times they would choose differently. It is also not like these are the only times they get candy or cheap toys. So, I know they are not deprived ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may all be my problem and maybe it is their ages or whatever. I know that it is similar with all of us. We all have things that we like to spend money on, and others may think &quot;Oh, that&#39;s wasteful!&quot; so I probably need to lighten up. I am just so worried that they will never figure this out. An I have environmental &quot;angst&quot; at the amount of stuff that comes in our house and goes out the trash.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what are others suggestions on this? I feel like my talking about all the issues wastefulness, environmental concerns, etc. is constantly rain on their parade....

I&#39;m glad I learned from that, but I feel bad that my mother let me waste all that money on junk.  I wish I could have had the guidance to see the wisdom in saving for something nicer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think part of the problem was that the only place we usually shopped was the grocery store, and all they had for toys was cheap junk.  My mother liked to get us something (I&#39;m sure we begged) everytime we went to the store, but it was always cheap.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the reason kids beg is because they want to feel like their parents care enough about them to spend money on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always kicked myself for not being able to save money because I always wanted so many little cheap things.  I still have trouble saving money.  It&#39;s like, maybe the habit stuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just to present a different view.  There is merit to helping your children understand the value of quality merchandise.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we still have to make mistakes to learn.  I&#39;m bad about having to learn everything the hard way--by experience--instead of listening to sound advice.  I think it&#39;s because I&#39;m a puzzle-worker.  I love mysteries, being able to solve things myself.  I&#39;m addicted to the euphoria of conquering a problem myself instead of someone else squashing my achievement by explaining how to do it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSent via the WebMail system at 1st.net</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Money Management","postDate":"1107927655","msgId":103232,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJBRUU5RDUwLTdBNUQtMTFEOS1CRkNGLTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNTIwMWM1MGYyYiQxYzI2NGU1MCRjNjUzNzlhNUBoZWF0aGVydXB4ZzZsZT4=","referencesHeader":"PGN1OTBtMytucmdhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDAxOTAxYzUwZjEyJGU0ZTc3ODUwJDY3NTQ3OWE1QGhlYXRoZXJ1cHhnNmxlPiA8OTcyNTc0MjYtN0E0NC0xMUQ5LUJGQ0YtMDAwQTk1N0VGRTQ2QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+IDwwMDUyMDFjNTBmMmIkMWMyNjRlNTAkYzY1Mzc5YTVAaGVhdGhlcnVweGc2bGU+"},"prevInTopic":103231,"nextInTopic":103236,"prevInTime":103231,"nextInTime":103233,"topicId":103217,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I would take my friends to fairs and I&#39;d buy them<br/>\nthings and take them on rides, if I could afford it.
