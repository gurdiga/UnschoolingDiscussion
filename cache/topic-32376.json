I don&#39;t consider it help because I do<br/>\nconsider the things they do their responsibility.  As a family, we are all<br/>\nin this together.  My kids (5 of them) know I need them to pitch in because<br/>\nwe talk about it, about what each would be willing to do, what they see as<br/>\ntheir responsibilities, etc..  Of course, with the younger kids, they need<br/>\nreminders and modeling.  But my oldest, at 11, is pretty much<br/>\nself-sufficient.  She cleans after herself, her animals, etc. with very<br/>\nlittle interference from me at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the &quot;trust kids&quot; part doesn&#39;t come in simply thinking the kids will<br/>\nmagically vacuum their room daily or whatever.  But it comes in when we talk<br/>\nwith our kids about needs and desires and listen to what they have to say.<br/>\nTo trust them to come up with solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32372,"nextTopicId":32377}}
