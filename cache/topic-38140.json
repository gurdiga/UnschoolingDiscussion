I have noticed, however, that there are ebbs and flows to the<br/>\nnegative interactions between my children and shifts in the dynamics at<br/>\nvarious times. (With three of them . . .there are more possibilities for<br/>\ncombinations!) I wanted the original mom (Patti? . . . sorry, I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember) to know that I truly believe this disheartening situation will<br/>\nchange, evolve and shift in time. And partly, that will it will be how she<br/>\nviews it and holds it in her consciousness. Not, that one should simply<br/>\nwait . . . all the various suggestions are worthy of contemplation and<br/>\npossible application . . . but it should cease to serve them someday. And,<br/>\nI wonder does she get the feedback from other people how amazing her boys<br/>\nare together when not with her? That one always gets me! . . . often people<br/>\ncomment on how devoted and caring and supportive my children are of each<br/>\nother when elsewhere.  In all honesty, I see it too - many times - but<br/>\nsomehow the loud, argumentative, hostile, rude times make a huger<br/>\nimpression. My involvement always makes it worse if I am charged . . .<br/>\nhence, I like Sandra&#39;s last suggestion. But, at times like that I like to<br/>\nremember the adage - Energy flows where attention goes. <br/>\n<br/>\nEnough of my rambling.
