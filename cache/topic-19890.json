Just short ones, and not about US,<br/>\n but about love or marriage in general. Then his cousin<br/>\n come up and do the official part. <br/>\n Any ideas along those lines? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I like the concept but beware of length. We had a JP and a friend of the <br/>\nfamily do a bit part. I do not remember a word he said. I was sweltering in <br/>\nthe sun and about to topple off the stone wall embankment we were upon. <br/>\nGranted we got married 4th of July weekend in PA. At least I was barefoot and <br/>\nthe grass felt cooler. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Many people still talk of our wedding as the coolest they have been to <br/>\nbut I can&#39;t remember much of it. We made the rounds and didn&#39;t even get half <br/>\nof our dinner. The damn photographer kept stealing us. I loathed him,we never <br/>\ndid buy any photos.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Our men wore white shirts and blue shorts and Tevas the girls wore blue <br/>\ndress w/ white flowers, something they could wear to another gathering <br/>\neasily. Any shoes they wanted any jewlery they wanted and so on. Guests were <br/>\ninvited to wear shorts or whatever. It was a semi formal outdoor wedding on <br/>\nmy parents farm. The JP said an Indian Prayer and we were married. Oh and one <br/>\nof the guys was stung by a bee while standing there. All our pics have him w/ <br/>\na giant welt on his forehead.<br/>\n<br/>\n    If I had to do it over again I would pick somewhere special to us and <br/>\ncasually invite those who wanted to attend. No stress, no fuss, and all fun. <br/>\nActually I&#39;d go w/ dh and get married alone on some awesome singletrack. I <br/>\nhave tried to tell all of my cousins to run away but no one listens. they are <br/>\nspending gobs and are stressing big time and family tiffs are popping up all <br/>\naround. Not worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n    OK sorry about that :o) Can you tell I am still a bit miffed about my <br/>\nwedding? Although we still call my dh assy from time to time&lt;that is what my <br/>\nGrandmother called him that day&gt;. UGH!<br/>\n<br/>\n   NICKI~ happily married to the greatest guy I  personally know.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19887,"nextTopicId":19054}}
