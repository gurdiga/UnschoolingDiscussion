The facet was attached to the house.  I was <br/>\nout in the front yard.  We talked about how there are certain times that <br/>\ngrown ups don&#39;t want to play at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBonnie was a fun neighbor, often they wet each other when they were both <br/>\nwatering at the same time.  It was a game, he really learned on his own that <br/>\nit isn&#39;t always a good thing to share your water with someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe sat pretty silently while we all ran around trying to remedy the situation <br/>\nand it all came together.  He was sad he had created such confusion and when <br/>\nwe talked about it, he just said he couldn&#39;t help it, he NEEDED to do it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe needed to do it because he didn&#39;t know the consequences, he needed that <br/>\nFUN moment.  Afterwards he saw what happened because of it, he NEVER did that <br/>\nagain.  I&#39;m sure he had opportunity because we were always gardening and <br/>\nwatering (those lovely HOA gardening contests) but he didn&#39;t.  He learned his <br/>\nlesson.  No spanking involved, no punishment from me involved.  The fact he <br/>\nmade Bonnie sad and upset was enough for him to know it wasn&#39;t a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63974,"nextTopicId":64328}}
