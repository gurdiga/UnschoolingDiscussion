I&#39;ve told her that it is her choice<br/>\n&gt; to continue with the instrument or not, but if she&#39;s going to<br/>\n&gt; continue, practice is part of the package deal.  I&#39;m paying for<br/>\n&gt; weekly lessons, it doesn&#39;t make sense to do that if she&#39;s not willing<br/>\n&gt; to put in the practice time.  I think she&#39;s just bored with it right<br/>\n&gt; now.<br/>\n&gt; I had considered stopping paying for lessons<br/>\n&gt; until she gets interested again, but she&#39;ll lose so much if she lets<br/>\n&gt; it slide for a year or more.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can you see this as less of a all or nothing situation?  What if you don&#39;t<br/>\nbug her about practicing?  What if she doesn&#39;t practice for a couple of<br/>\nweeks?  What if she goes unprepared to her lessons for a month?  I can tell<br/>\nyou from the teacher&#39;s perspective that she wouldn&#39;t be the first student<br/>\nI&#39;ve had come unprepared, and likely not the last.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it likely that your daughter is going to let is slide for a year or more,<br/>\nor would she merely like a break?  Does she like the music she&#39;s playing, or<br/>\nwould she like to try something totally different -- jazz, fiddle, rock,<br/>\netc?  Is there a problem with the teacher that she hasn&#39;t mentioned yet?<br/>\n<br/>\nI try hard to let my son&#39;s piano practice just happen, although if I haven&#39;t<br/>\nheard the piano in a few days I might mention missing hearing him play.<br/>\nSometimes that gets him going, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.  I don&#39;t particularly<br/>\ncare either way, since it&#39;s far more important to me that his childhood<br/>\nmemories aren&#39;t filled with a nagging Mommy but with music as fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, if she wants to play flute, perhaps she could borrow one from a<br/>\nfriend to try out, or save up her allowance to help buy a used one.  Again,<br/>\nit&#39;s not all or nothing; lots of kids play two instruments!<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44279,"nextTopicId":44282}}
