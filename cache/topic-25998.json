He&#39;s  <br/>\nmore charismatic than I am and does really well in first-impression  <br/>\nsituations so I didn&#39;t say a word about the regular interview  <br/>\ncoaching stuff.

Even if it was an  <br/>\ninside promotion, we had to interview two other applicants, because  <br/>\nit was a state job (at the records office at the university, where I  <br/>\nworked for a year and a  half after I stopped teaching).   Sometimes  <br/>\nwe filled the lower spot with one of those interviewed.  That&#39;s kind  <br/>\nof a bummer, to apply for one job and be offered a lower one, and  <br/>\nsometimes they were interested and sometimes they weren&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat kind of comes under conversation, though, so I guess it&#39;s not a  <br/>\nseparate kind of mom-duty. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163468813,"authorName":"patricia tidmore","from":"patricia tidmore &lt;ptidmore1117@...&gt;","profile":"ptidmore1117","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] shifting with age","postDate":"1152450708","msgId":26244,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNzA5MTMxMTQ4LjY2NzAyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMzA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwNzA5MTE1NzM4LjEzMjU4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMzA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26243,"nextInTopic":26247,"prevInTime":26243,"nextInTime":26245,"topicId":25998,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"OOOooooops!

I thought the same thing when I <br/>\nposted.  We&#39;ve been homeschooling over 4 years now.  Of all the <br/>\nacquaintances we&#39;ve come across, we&#39;ve only become &#39;friends&#39; with <br/>\ntwo families.  They have been our regular play-dates.  Between our <br/>\nthree families, we have 4 boys and 2 girls.  Both families <br/>\nhomeschool in a traditional manner, one schools in the mornings and <br/>\nthe other schools mostly in the afternoons.  It makes getting <br/>\ntogether challenging, but we&#39;ve been doing pretty good so far.  <br/>\nThey&#39;ve now formed a First Lego League team that meets 3 days per <br/>\nweek, Tuesday through Thursday.  Jeffrey went to the first few <br/>\nmeetings but decided against joining the team.  We were basically <br/>\ntold they&#39;d be so busy with the Lego stuff that they couldn&#39;t <br/>\nschedule any park days or play-dates until the end of October.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t invite &#39;strangers&#39; to our home because it makes my son <br/>\nuncomfortable.  If he doesn&#39;t know the person, he feels anxious <br/>\nabout them being in his room and touching his things.  Also, Jeffrey <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like to play outside much (which makes park days kind of <br/>\nweird since we can never stay longer than about 90 minutes). <br/>\n<br/>\nA biggie around here is homeschool classes.  We tried many because <br/>\nwe liked the idea of being with other homeschoolers but we don&#39;t <br/>\nlike the formal structure of the classes.  Even the fun enrichment <br/>\nclasses didn&#39;t excite my children.  Besides, we&#39;ve never met <br/>\na &#39;friend&#39; in any class.  The kids rush in, do their class, then <br/>\nrush out again either to another class or leaving the building.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t see how other homeschoolers call it socialization.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCo-ops don&#39;t seem to be popular because they involve work.  Every <br/>\ntime I&#39;ve tried getting something together, I get many interested <br/>\nfamilies who want to drop their children off so they either have <br/>\nsome alone time or time with younger children.  I don&#39;t want to run <br/>\na babysitting service.  People would rather pay for classes because <br/>\nthey don&#39;t have to be involved.  The excuse I&#39;ve heard most often is <br/>\nthat they are homeschoolers who are with their children all the time <br/>\nand they use homeschool classes and extracurricular activities as a <br/>\nbreak.  That just doesn&#39;t fit our lifestyle.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne helpful thing is that my DH works from home on Mondays now.  I <br/>\nwant to try doing either Girl Scouts or an American girl thing on <br/>\nMondays since Jeffrey can stay home with Dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, no, I&#39;m really not using excuses.  I just keep running into <br/>\nobstacles.  It&#39;s hard to get out and meet people when my son has <br/>\nsuch a hard time with new things.  Even going to a new store or <br/>\nrestaurant brings on a huge amount of anxiety for him.  I wish I <br/>\nlived closer to my mom.  Then he could stay with her while Allison <br/>\nand I run around town.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Meeting childrens&#39; needs simultaneously.","postDate":"1149300081","msgId":26005,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRhNS5lODQ1Y2UuMzFiMjQ3NzFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26004,"nextInTopic":26006,"prevInTime":26004,"nextInTime":26006,"topicId":25998,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Beth, I have four children ages 14 down to 2, I ve been there.

He might be wanting to stay  <br/>\nhome because he doesn&#39;t feel comfortable with the level of separation  <br/>\nhe feels from you when you are involved with other people. Making a  <br/>\nlot more concerted effort to remain &quot;connected&quot; with him, while  <br/>\nyou&#39;re out, might be very helpful. Looking him in the eyes a lot,  <br/>\npatting or touching him, checking in with him more frequently, and  <br/>\nspending time while you are out playing with him, not half-playing  <br/>\nwhile talking to other moms &lt;g&gt;, might help him be more comfortable  <br/>\nout of the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there are all the ways to help your daughter feel more  <br/>\ncomfortable staying home....make home more exciting, invite people  <br/>\nover more, do more stuff with her at home, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll probably need to do a combination of lots of things.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244909672,"authorName":"freepsgal","from":"&quot;freepsgal&quot; &lt;freepsgal@...&gt;","profile":"freepsgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Meeting childrens&#39; needs simultaneously.","postDate":"1149268186","msgId":25998,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU1cHJjcStkOWZuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25999,"prevInTime":25997,"nextInTime":25999,"topicId":25998,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I d love some insight on how to handle this.

My dd8 wants to get <br/>\nout and do as much as possible because she is so bored at home.  My <br/>\nds9 prefers staying home.  We do not have anyone nearby that can <br/>\nhang out with my son.  My closest relative is 1 hour away and our <br/>\nhomeschool friends are too busy homeschooling and doing their own <br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI help my son bring things to do, meaning I remind him that we <br/>\nshould grab some things to take with us like his gameboy and some <br/>\nbooks.  He complains about wanting to be at home though.  If we stay <br/>\nhome too much, my daughter cries because she is bored.  Yes, I&#39;ve <br/>\ntried to help them find things they find interesting but my daughter <br/>\nmostly complains about not having anyone to play with.  My DH and I <br/>\nare thinking about joining the YMCA to find some classes for my <br/>\ndaughter, but the facility is just too far to drop her off.  She <br/>\nalso wants to start a co-op with other girls for American Girl <br/>\nstuff.  My son just hangs his head down and groans because when he <br/>\nhears her planning these things, he feels he&#39;ll have no choice but <br/>\nto tag along.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow can I meet their needs without making the other one feel <br/>\nmiserable?<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26205,"nextTopicId":26250}}
