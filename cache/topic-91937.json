I dont <br/>\nnormally feel the panic but this year has not been as productive looking as years <br/>\npast and I needed ideas.  With portfolios a few months away I am beginning to <br/>\nstress. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know he has learned a lot this year (esp medical stuff) but normally we <br/>\nhave a good mix.  I know I have not had as much time to sit with him and I feel <br/>\nbad for that. I have between two and six weeks left in my pregnancy due to low <br/>\nfluid and placenta issues due to diabetes so the coming weeks will be <br/>\nnonproductive Im sure. <br/>\nMy focus is a bit off....  I also know a good month after the baby comes is <br/>\ngoing to be trying for our family as well.  With two toddlers a 12 yr. old and <br/>\na new baby on the way I feel as If I am always asking him to wait until I tend <br/>\nto them.  Not to mention we haven&#39;t been to many places other than shopping <br/>\nthis year.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn top of the portfolio worries he is being contacted by girls who seem to <br/>\nhave taken quite an interest in him (not to mention look much older than he).  <br/>\nIf it isn&#39;t the computer it is the phone ringing. I know he is growing up but <br/>\nthe &quot;public school&quot; world is a bit too advanced for my comfort. I dislike my <br/>\nfeelings on this because I have always trusted his judgment but lately I feel <br/>\nlike I am dealing with issues everyday. Its not even him it is the other <br/>\nchildren who do not live in my home.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the portfolio end its not really a lack of learning its more me converting <br/>\nour life this year. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? I feel much too much stress daily over all <br/>\nof this. I was wanting to get almost all of my portfolio done so I could be <br/>\nwith my family in May/June but my brain is mush..<br/>\nI cant help but wish we could just test him this year but I dislike that <br/>\ngreatly. I even stooped as low as asking him about curriculums today. UGH! I know <br/>\nI am stressing him out and making him worry over nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Year end/unschooling during a pregnancy","postDate":"1079448755","msgId":91951,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwNTcxNEIzLjEwOTAzMDlAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQwMzE2MTkzNy4xYjNyUk01VmUzTlpGalYwQHNwYXJyb3c+"},"prevInTopic":91950,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":91950,"nextInTime":91952,"topicId":91937,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**Can he be invited to help(or does he already) with putting the materials together and doing the actual physical work of cutting and pasting?

He may<br/>\nhave some surprising ideas about how some of the stuff he is doing will<br/>\nconvert.**<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he may remember more than you about the year.  (My brain was really mush when I was pregnant.)  Or the two of you, reminiscing together may remember extra stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are way &quot;lacking&quot; in History or Social Studies you can pad things out by renting some interesting historical videos.  If you are feeling obligated to add some Math, you might want to buy or borrow a Math computer game.  (I figure your feet aren&#39;t really up for, say, field trips, so I&#39;m looking for high interest learning stuff that combines well with sitting.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\n** Yes he does help and in the past its been fun. Im looking for a<br/>\nstarting point but I cant find one. I know he sure has learned alot<br/>\nabout pregnancy, diabetes,insulin,ultrasounds, hospitals ,breeding<br/>\ndogs and raising pups.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s your starting point.  Write it down all of these things <br/>\nthat he did or discussed last year.  Write it down in real language <br/>\nfirst, with some detail, and when you are done doing that with his help, <br/>\nthen transform it into pompous teacher language.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91930,"nextTopicId":91963}}
