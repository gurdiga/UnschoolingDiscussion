There has been some local trouble,<br/>\nwith a couple homeschool families being &#39;hot-lined&#39;.. mostly because of<br/>\nneighbors that simply do not understand the nature of homeschooling, but its<br/>\nnever went beyond an interview with the families.<br/>\nI still struggle with &#39;record keeping&#39; too, and worry about how things will<br/>\nlook if we ever do have to prove anything. I wish all of this weren&#39;t<br/>\nnecessary, I wish my girls and I could just forget all of the proper<br/>\npaperwork thing and just enjoy our life and learning together.<br/>\nBYW- I really appreciate your words of wisdom, and this list.. I think I&#39;ve<br/>\nfinally found my &#39;support group&#39;..<br/>\n~Julie in MO</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14327,"nextTopicId":14314}}
