The public generally understands<br/>\nwhat is meant by &quot;constitutional&quot; foundations, They understand less what we<br/>\nmean by a return to &quot;Biblical&quot; foundations. Some accuse us of wanting to<br/>\nimpose a &quot;theocracy&quot; upon as our government. Others accused us of wanting to<br/>\n&quot;impose our morality&quot; upon American&#39;s private lives. Neither accusation is<br/>\ntrue. A &quot;theocracy&quot; is not our goal. Our goal is to return to the political<br/>\ngovernment defined in the Constitution by our Founding Fathers. We do not<br/>\nseek to legislate God&#39;s Law into our governmental processes. We do seek to<br/>\nhave God-fearing men and women serving at all levels of our government.<br/>\nTheir influence for promoting the general welfare cannot help but to give<br/>\nstrength and encouragement to all American people. What are the Biblical<br/>\nfoundations upon which America was based? Although there are many, some<br/>\nimportant ones are:<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, God is sovereign over the nation not man. This means that there is a<br/>\nLaw higher than the Law of the State. Thus, the State is not and cannot be<br/>\nthe last appeal of our aggrieved citizens.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, we Americans are individuals created equal by God, as noted in the<br/>\nDeclaration of Independence. Thus, the individual is more important in God&#39;s<br/>\neyes than the State. In tyrannical societies, there is no power higher than<br/>\nthe State.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, we recognize the truth of the Biblical assertion of the innate<br/>\nsinfulness of man. This means that all persons have within themselves the<br/>\ntendency to think of their own well-being before that of others. Thus, no<br/>\none person can be completely trusted with power. Therefore, we need the<br/>\nchecks and balances defined in our Constitution.<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth, God is the God of History. He forms nations. He judges nations. We<br/>\nknow from our history, and as stated by our Founding Fathers, that the<br/>\nUnited States could not have been formed without the providence of God. We<br/>\ncannot continue as a free, independent sovereign nation without the<br/>\nprovidence of God.<br/>\n<br/>\nFifth, God gave mankind a Law which is unchangeable absolute truth.<br/>\nRelativism being taught in our public schools depends only upon man&#39;s<br/>\ndecisions, not God&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, God is the present and ultimate judge over the deeds of nations. No<br/>\nnation can hide from or avoid this judgment of God. This means that there is<br/>\na price to be paid for every action of injustice, immorality, dishonesty,<br/>\nand corruption taken by leaders, governments, societies and individuals.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon these foundations, America will stand. If they are destroyed, so will<br/>\nour nation.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Signed)<br/>\nAlbion W.

Someone said that Recons, or HSLDA, want to *return* <br/>\nthe US to &quot;the theocracy that the Founders intended it to be.&quot; I responded <br/>\nwith the above, as if to say &quot;when and where and how did the Founders ever <br/>\nintend such a thing?&quot; knowing full well that they feared nothing more, and <br/>\nwere well aware that Americans in their individual states could handle <br/>\nreligion on their own. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my readings of Recon and HSLDA material, I don&#39;t doubt that the intention <br/>\nto create a theocracy may be their motivation, but I don&#39;t think I have ever <br/>\nread anything by them wherein they admitted to believing the Founders <br/>\nintended a theocracy. The Recons aren&#39;t illiterate. Crazy? Yes, but not <br/>\nignorant. I also believe they can be highly and intentionally deceptive. For <br/>\nexample:<br/>\n<br/>\nJust yesterday Gary North had a wonderful piece at LewRockwell.com, on the <br/>\nlate and estimable Robert Nisbet. Everything in the piece was very good <br/>\n(until the end when North diverges into his Medieval rant about &quot;covenants&quot;), <br/>\nand his take on Nisbet&#39;s view about the Founders was right on the money, <br/>\ni.e., the Founders would be beside themselves at the state of America (pun <br/>\nintended), especially the bloated war machine, and the &quot;loose individual&quot; <br/>\n(title of one of Nisbet&#39;s chapters in The Present Age).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, why would Gary North write a praise piece about Nisbet, when all that <br/>\nNorth stands for flies in the face of what Nisbet stood for. It is deceptive <br/>\nto say the least. Robert Nisbet would consider Gary North a sociopath if he <br/>\nread some of North&#39;s writings, which indeed look to the day when America will <br/>\nbe ruled by the Old Testament.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob Sale<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":36888606,"authorName":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare","from":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare &lt;nedvare@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:  2248 - Theocracy ?","postDate":"1029534889","msgId":41290,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5ODJFQ0UyLjEzQ0UlbmVkdmFyZUBudHBseC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjk0MjIzOTYuMTUzOC44MTEzMS5tM0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":41302,"prevInTime":41289,"nextInTime":41291,"topicId":41290,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"on 8/15/02 10:39 AM, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com at Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com wrote: ...

Before<br/>\nthat time, churches had close ties to local governments -- towns elected the<br/>\nleaders of the large congregations to run the towns (in New England<br/>\nespecially) Not that there was anything wrong with that, but one main effect<br/>\nwas that it made religion and government into one (cozy) thing, with<br/>\nfinancial ties very common.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat separation of church and state has led to recent arguments against<br/>\nvouchers, but those arguments have been declared invalid by the supreme<br/>\ncourt in the case of Cleveland, because there is no direct tie between the<br/>\nmoney spent by the state and the religious schools where it might end up --<br/>\nthat is a parent&#39;s choice after the money is in the parents&#39; hands. Like<br/>\nfood stamps -- no tellin&#39; where they&#39;ll be spent or on what, or whether the<br/>\nmoney they represent will support the unsavory habits of store keepers who<br/>\naccept them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe founding fathers wanted to break the bonds (binds) between church and<br/>\nstate, thus they did NOT want a theocracy. They wanted UNtheocracy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut  HSLDA does seek theocracy. That&#39;s what Patrick Henry College is about,<br/>\ntraining young evangelical fundamental christians to be politicians who will<br/>\nchange laws in order to turn the country into a theocracy based on their own<br/>\npersonal ideas of  &quot;Theo.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\n&quot;If I owned Texas and Hell, I&#39;d rent out Texas and live in Hell&quot;<br/>\n                    ---- Philip Sheridan<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In heaven all the interesting people are missing.&quot;  ---  Nietzsche</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41278,"nextTopicId":41342}}
