The little community where our land is located is Schroeder.<br/>\nAbout the only thing there is a little renovated one room school house<br/>\nthat my grandmother, grandfather, and allot of my great aunts and uncles<br/>\nattended.  About two miles away is the Lutheran Church where me and my<br/>\nwife were married, and my Grandmother and Grandfather before us.  My<br/>\nGreat Grandfather hauled wood from now extinct Port Indianola, (appx. 60<br/>\nmiles) in a wagon back to Schroeder (which at that time was called<br/>\nGermantown) to help build the church.  There is also one of the oldest<br/>\ndance halls in Texas there which started out being a community hall.<br/>\nThe Land has been in my family for over 100 yrs.  I have been dreaming<br/>\nabout moving there and building a house where the old homesite of my<br/>\nGreat Grandfather was before it burned down around the turn of the<br/>\nprevious century.  Oh well,  I better shut up now before I can&#39;t. Love<br/>\nmy land.<br/>\nKyle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8045,"nextTopicId":8007}}
