The doctor felt that Liam had <br/>\ngotten the flu and his one eardrum was pretty red.  I came home with four <br/>\nremedies, and no antibiotics.  Liam is so comfortable with this guy, he <br/>\nactually asked me to bring him to the doctor!<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel so bad that Liam is going to be missing out on the cool Halloween <br/>\nthings we had planned to do.

In Europe, the energy around sex and bodies in general is much more relaxed.

I matured early and was certainly looking for love, but not neccessarily in the wrong places and i don&#39;t believe this is/was pathological or unhealthy for me--quite the opposite!

I think for a 12 or 13<br/>\nyear old, this show is pretty good for introducing relationship issues,<br/>\nincluding the sexual part of relationships.  It shows, in a pretty<br/>\ndetailed way, what both the boy and the girl in the relationship might<br/>\nbe feeling.  Although my 8 year old watches sometimes, it&#39;s not what I<br/>\nwould pick as a jumping off point for introducing the topics to a 9 year old.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  (I liked the movie The Wedding Planner, because the &quot;cute couple&quot;<br/>\ndecided NOT to dump their partners to instantly get it on with each<br/>\nother.  They waited until their other relationships ended before they<br/>\nwent after each other.)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":80046248,"authorName":"Dalene and Andy","from":"&quot;Dalene and Andy&quot; &lt;mactier@...&gt;","profile":"mactiers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] s*x questions, was Kids and movies and books","postDate":"1035746024","msgId":48397,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjMwMWMyN2RlYyRmODliYTkyMCRjNzUzMzdkMkBocHBhdj4=","referencesHeader":"PEYxODZZOHBFQnRLYXJ2enIwZFMwMDAwOTNiM0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48429,"prevInTime":48396,"nextInTime":48398,"topicId":48397,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... say it.
