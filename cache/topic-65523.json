Children aren&#39;t adults, so don&#39;t expect them to behave as though they were. <br/>\n  b.. Children learn by doing, so don&#39;t expect to approve of everything they do. <br/>\n  c.. It is a rare child whose behavior equals his parents&#39; expectations. <br/>\n  d.. Children are more likely to do as you do than to do as you say. <br/>\n  e.. It is often less important for parents to control their children&#39;s behavior than it is for them to control their own. <br/>\n  f.. Children react to anger; they respond to love and affection. <br/>\nI printed them out and they serve to remind me ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Kelli Traaseth <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, April 20, 2003 9:49 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Praise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Heather,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with Life Learning Magazine?

The first view being that it&#39;s good for their self esteem, it gives them pride in the work that they have accomplished or with what ever they have done.  The second view is that a child who is always praised will only do things to please adults rather than to please herself, to hear others talk good about her.  Kiele looks for praise constantly although I do see the pride that she takes in her work whether it&#39;s building with blocks or coloring a picture, however she looks for my approval to see if I like what she has done.  I know that this is normal for a 4 year old, but I was just wondering if giving her praise all the time for everything that she does is good for her?   If anyone has some pointers on this I would appreciate it...<br/>\n    Thanks<br/>\n    Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n    [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Yahoo!

Truthful<br/>\npraise, imho, can do no harm.  I also think there is such a thing as<br/>\noverdoing it, though.  For example, pulling out the bells and whistles for<br/>\n*every tiny little thing*.  &quot;WOW, you are the BEST child in the WHOLE ENTIRE<br/>\nWORLD&quot; is great here and there.  We over did those type of statements with<br/>\nour now 6 yr old and she went through quite a phase of letting EVERYONE know<br/>\njust how incredibly wonderful she was at any opportunity.  That tends to<br/>\nturn people off, even their friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI take every opportunity to tell my children when they are doing something<br/>\nright, nice, and so on.  &quot;Thanks for helping your sister with ________, that<br/>\nwas very nice of you.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you for _____ all by yourself!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven using gentle parenting techniques, it is so easy to pay more attention<br/>\nto the &#39;bad&#39; things.  I think the key is to *catch* our children being good<br/>\nand doing well and honestly comment on those things.  Offering unrealistic<br/>\npraise *can* be detrimental to a child who *may* grow up thinking they can<br/>\ndo no wrong.  There *may* also come a time, further down the road that they<br/>\nbecome fearful of sharing important situations or times of bad judgment in<br/>\nfear of what their parents might think of their *perfect* child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend whose parents treated her as if she were THE best child on<br/>\nearth.  She became pregnant at 14 and went to her choir teacher at school to<br/>\nconfide because she was so terrified of letting her parents down.  She truly<br/>\nbelieved that they thought she was perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to say this extreme situation is normal or even probable in<br/>\nevery circumstance.  I just think we owe it to our children to be honest<br/>\nwith them and let them know that we ARE proud of them for their<br/>\naccomplishments and will offer honest praise accordingly, but that they are<br/>\nalso allowed to make mistakes and that we will help them resolve their<br/>\nmistakes and still love them regardless.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 yr old made a rather large mistake recently and I calmly explained why<br/>\nI was upset.  A couple of days later, she wrote me a letter, apologizing,<br/>\nsuggesting a consequence very appropriate to the situation and offered an<br/>\nappropriate solution.  All on her own!  When I told her how proud of her I<br/>\nwas and how impressed I was and kept going, she finally stopped me and said,<br/>\n&quot;Goolleeee Mom, you don&#39;t have to over do it or I might do it again!&quot;  Of<br/>\ncourse, she was laughing but it was a wise lesson.

One that will make them feel good. I also see<br/>\nthe point of how praising just everything isn&#39;t good either. I watch what I<br/>\nsay and how I say it. I make sure to comment on how much work it looks like<br/>\nwent into that picture they just did or how I love the way they used color.<br/>\nSomething else beside just &quot;oh isn&#39;t that lovely, it&#39;s beautiful.&quot; Making<br/>\nsure I praise the effort instead of just the picture. I think that makes a<br/>\nbig difference. Not just the result but the process to get there. I think<br/>\nthat helps so much with their self esteem and not always concentrating on<br/>\nwhether the end result will be to anyone else&#39;s satisfaction. I do this with<br/>\nall comments, or I should say I try on most. Even with something like<br/>\ncleaning up the playroom without me asking. Instead of just saying great<br/>\njob, I will comment on how nice it was to do that because they know it makes<br/>\nme feel good and how much time it took them and how organized everything<br/>\nlooks.

When I was<br/>\nfirst awarded placement of Brianna, I searched for day care. (I was<br/>\nfinishing a degree program and working.) The competition for some of the<br/>\n&#39;pre-school enrichment & learning centers&#39; was fierce!!<br/>\nThe state was helping me pay for this, so I thought that with the state<br/>\nmoney and what I could afford, Brianna would be in a great day care program.<br/>\nMy college courses were 4 days per week. 9AM-11:45AM. I found a day care<br/>\nthat was seemingly okay. They concentrated on organized activities. They<br/>\npromised &quot;learning adventures&quot; This day care was one of the most desired in<br/>\nthe area!<br/>\nI would drop her off at around 8:20 AM and usually I was there by noon. I<br/>\nmust say that the day care required payment for a full day (7AM-5:30PM).<br/>\nOne day, due to a major traffic problem, I arrived there at approx 12:45 PM.<br/>\nI had called the office and explained the traffic situation. The office<br/>\nperson put me on hold. The director came on and asked me when I would be<br/>\nthere. I honestly couldn&#39;t give an answer. I was in traffic, it was beyond<br/>\nmy control. She informed me that our agreement was that I pick Brianna up<br/>\naround noon. I pointed out that the center was getting paid for full time<br/>\nday care and had been, in fact, providing part time day care, I also said<br/>\nthat this was very unusual for me to be late and that I really didn&#39;t see<br/>\nthe problem.<br/>\nWhen I arrived, Brianna was sitting out by the double locked doors - by<br/>\nherself- with her little school bag and jacket. She was frightened. Just a<br/>\nfew feet away - in her classroom, the kids were playing.<br/>\nWhen the secretary came to open the door for me, I was pissed! I wanted to<br/>\nspeak to the administrator, but was told she was busy. I could see the<br/>\noffice, the woman was eating a salad & reading Cosmo.<br/>\nI picked Brianna up and walked into the administrators office. I fired them.<br/>\nNot only did I pull Brianna out, I put a stop payment on the check and had<br/>\nthis daycare stricken from the state rolls so the state wouldn&#39;t pay for<br/>\nthem anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking back, this action of theirs was part & parcel of training the kids.<br/>\nThe administrator told me that Brianna needed to be disciplined, trained -<br/>\nthat she was spoiled. (At this time, Brianna had seen goddess knows what<br/>\nwhile in custody of her bio-mom who was an iv drug user.) Brianna was &<br/>\nremains a rather quiet kid. Back then, she was very quiet. kids used to take<br/>\nher snacks, her toys and she would say & do nothing. I couldn&#39;t understand<br/>\nwhat this cosmos reading woman was talking about!!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the rest of the semester, Brianna went into another day care that was so<br/>\nmuch better, however, it was serendipitous that I got her in there!! It was<br/>\nalso over $100.00 per week more!! (thank goddess for the state help!)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a long time after the experience w/ the first day care, Brianna was very<br/>\nwary of doing ANYTHING!!! w/o asking! She would get visibly upset over<br/>\n&quot;being wrong&quot; in writing, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nall in all - it was terrible for Brianna.<br/>\n<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, April 19, 2003 8:01 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Definition of unschooling, was; FLORIDA<br/>\nIntro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;When someone with a one year old says &quot;unschooling&quot; the question is &quot;as<br/>\n  &gt;opposed to what?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;d have to say, as opposed enrolling the kid in my next door neighbor&#39;s<br/>\n  licensed-for-12-we-do-activities-at-10am and<br/>\n  3pm-and-structure-everything-else-too day care.

OH, let me<br/>\nsee,<br/>\nyes, I think it is pretty, what do you think?  Do you like it?   Maybe say,<br/>\nmy favorite part is the &quot;X&quot;, what do you like best about it?    Then you can<br/>\ntalk about the picture, maybe the kid will say, I love the &quot;X&quot; but, I think<br/>\nthe &quot;Y&quot; look stupid..   Ask why they think the Y looks stupid, how could<br/>\nthey<br/>\nfix it.. etc etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Another good way to encourage children without &quot;labeling&quot; them is to<br/>\npraise them with a variety of adjectives.  Instead of always saying.. &quot;good,<br/>\ngreat, wonderful, smart&quot;, use more direct and descriptive words .. For<br/>\ninstance, instead of saying. &quot;oh that is a great picture&quot;.. say.. Oh, you<br/>\nare<br/>\nso creative and expressive with your paints&quot;.    Instead of saying, &quot;you are<br/>\nso smart for figuring that out&quot;,  say, &quot;that took some real logic and<br/>\ncalcuation to solve&quot;  Say a child picks up all of thier toys and tidys a<br/>\nroom<br/>\nup without being asked to help.  Instead of saying,  oh, what a good boy,<br/>\nthank you so much.. Say, Thank you,  you are so considerate and helpful.<br/>\nYou<br/>\nare an excellent organizer.<br/>\n<br/>\n I have always tried to express to my children what wonderful qualities they<br/>\nhave without lumping them all under &quot;good or smart&quot; categories.    I think<br/>\nit<br/>\nstrengthens thier sense of self and uniqueness and boosts their self esteem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 10<br/>\n   Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2003 12:05:42 EDT<br/>\n   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grlynbl@...\">grlynbl@...</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: Praise<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 4/20/03 12:42:57 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummy124@...\">mummy124@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I also wanted to add to my last post that if it&#39;s something my child did<br/>\n&gt; creatively, like a picture or making up a game, I always ask them how they<br/>\n&gt; feel about what they did.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I just basically said the same thing that Mary did..

The first view being that it&#39;s<br/>\ngood for their self esteem, it gives them pride in the work that they have<br/>\naccomplished or with what ever they have done.  The second view is that a<br/>\nchild who is always praised will only do things to please adults rather than<br/>\nto please herself, to hear others talk good about her.  Kiele looks for<br/>\npraise constantly although I do see the pride that she takes in her work<br/>\nwhether it&#39;s building with blocks or coloring a picture, however she looks<br/>\nfor my approval to see if I like what she has done.  I know that this is<br/>\nnormal for a 4 year old, but I was just wondering if giving her praise all<br/>\nthe time for everything that she does is good for her?

The first view being that it&#39;s good for their self esteem, it gives them pride in the work that they have accomplished or with what ever they have done.  The second view is that a child who is always praised will only do things to please adults rather than to please herself, to hear others talk good about her.  Kiele looks for praise constantly although I do see the pride that she takes in her work whether it&#39;s building with blocks or coloring a picture, however she looks for my approval to see if I like what she has done.  I know that this is normal for a 4 year old, but I was just wondering if giving her praise all the time for everything that she does is good for her?   If anyone has some pointers on this I would appreciate it...<br/>\n  Thanks<br/>\n  Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Of course, you don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to criticize a childs efforts by saying.. UHHG, that is awful, that is <br/>\nso ugly, that is worthless.. BUT, I have also read ( and heard) that if you <br/>\nconstantly tell a child thier efforts are WONDERFUL, GREAT, THE BEST!, and <br/>\nthey know in thier hearts its really lousy, then that breaks down thier trust <br/>\nin you.    A good way to approach this and open up the lines of communication <br/>\nis to ask the child what they think about the &quot;thing&quot;, or how they feel about <br/>\nit.  For example, a child paints a picture and brings it to you, all <br/>\nexcited.. LOOK Mommy, LOOK! at my picture.. isn&#39;t it pretty?  OH, let me see, <br/>\nyes, I think it is pretty, what do you think?  Do you like it?   Maybe say, <br/>\nmy favorite part is the &quot;X&quot;, what do you like best about it?    Then you can <br/>\ntalk about the picture, maybe the kid will say, I love the &quot;X&quot; but, I think <br/>\nthe &quot;Y&quot; look stupid..   Ask why they think the Y looks stupid, how could they <br/>\nfix it.. etc etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Another good way to encourage children without &quot;labeling&quot; them is to <br/>\npraise them with a variety of adjectives.  Instead of always saying.. &quot;good, <br/>\ngreat, wonderful, smart&quot;, use more direct and descriptive words .. For <br/>\ninstance, instead of saying. &quot;oh that is a great picture&quot;.. say.. Oh, you are <br/>\nso creative and expressive with your paints&quot;.    Instead of saying, &quot;you are <br/>\nso smart for figuring that out&quot;,  say, &quot;that took some real logic and <br/>\ncalcuation to solve&quot;  Say a child picks up all of thier toys and tidys a room <br/>\nup without being asked to help.  Instead of saying,  oh, what a good boy, <br/>\nthank you so much.. Say, Thank you,  you are so considerate and helpful.  You <br/>\nare an excellent organizer.  <br/>\n<br/>\n I have always tried to express to my children what wonderful qualities they <br/>\nhave without lumping them all under &quot;good or smart&quot; categories.    I think it <br/>\nstrengthens thier sense of self and uniqueness and boosts their self esteem.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":89681911,"authorName":"Angela","from":"&quot;Angela&quot; &lt;unschooling@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Praise","postDate":"1050835807","msgId":65539,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMzMDcyYSQ5ZDQzZTg0MCQ2OTAwYThjMEBsZWlnaD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PE9FMzVSMTYwamZhV0NaUUkweEEwMDAwMDQ2MEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":65536,"nextInTopic":65547,"prevInTime":65538,"nextInTime":65540,"topicId":65523,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Heather, The book Punished By Rewards  by Alfie Kohn addresses this issue.

I <br/>\ncould converse with them about it, ask them questions to draw them out to <br/>\ntell me more about how they did it, and what the characters are doing, or <br/>\nwhere they got the idea, or something that creates more understanding and <br/>\nappreciation for me, and gives them a chance to explain more about what they <br/>\nmade/built/wrote/planned.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday some friends came over who hadn&#39;t been over for a few months, and Keith <br/>\nwas showing them his yard project.  Then we ended up in the garage to get a <br/>\ntool, and they saw his current wood carving.   Thinking back on those <br/>\nconversations, as candid examples of honest interaction involving praise, <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t gush, they didn&#39;t use &quot;the poodle voice,&quot; and they didn&#39;t say <br/>\nanything like &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you&quot; or &quot;This is WONderful.&quot;  They asked <br/>\nquestions about what kind of gate he was going to use, what kind of tree one <br/>\ntree was, and about the wood, they talked about poplar wood and carving <br/>\npatterns and what he could do to make his knotwork horse look less <br/>\ndragonlike.  He told them about the bed he&#39;s making.  We talked about <br/>\nmedieval tents (we&#39;ve discovered a new Viking tent design).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were no kids around.  Keith was getting some very positive feedback, <br/>\nbut they were also drawing him out to teach them more about what he was doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly was doing some painting last week, and using nail polish for some of <br/>\nher paint.  We talked about textures and whether other paints and markers <br/>\ncould go with it or whether they chemically clashed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI ask sometimes if she wants me to keep something for her, or if she wants to <br/>\nput it up.  Sometimes it&#39;s yes, and sometimes no.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen some parents say &quot;I LOVE this and I want to put it on the wall&quot; <br/>\nwhen the kid might not be finished with it, or might have just wanted someone <br/>\nto say &quot;I like the way you wrote your name on that picture.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nAs kids get older, one thing they&#39;re learning from us is how to act with <br/>\nothers, and so if we treat them like other people instead of like kids, we <br/>\nmodel respect and interest instead of just praise.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my husband shows me something he&#39;s making (or I show him something new, <br/>\nlike a webpage or a sewing project) we can TELL how the other person feels <br/>\nabout it, so saying &quot;How do you feel about this?&quot; seems to impersonal for <br/>\npeople who live together and can read each other already.  If a kid brings a <br/>\npicture she doesn&#39;t like, wouldn&#39;t the mom know?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way I found to keep from just making mom-noises was to remember not to <br/>\nsay &quot;This is good.&quot;  I don&#39;t KNOW something is &quot;good,&quot; and it makes better <br/>\nsense (and better communication, and conversation) for me to say &quot;I really <br/>\nlike this&quot; (&quot;I&quot; messages) or &quot;How pretty, especially the trees.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Praise","postDate":"1050813611","msgId":65532,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTkwMWMzMDZmNiRlZGRiNGU4MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PE9FMzVSMTYwamZhV0NaUUkweEEwMDAwMDQ2MEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":65531,"nextInTopic":65536,"prevInTime":65531,"nextInTime":65533,"topicId":65523,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I also wanted to add to my last post that if it s something my child did creatively, like a picture or making up a game, I always ask them how they feel about","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1666877542\">I also wanted to add to my last post that if it&#39;s something my child did<br/>\ncreatively, like a picture or making up a game, I always ask them how they<br/>\nfeel about what they did.

I know that this is<br/>\nnormal for a 4 year old, but I was just wondering if giving her praise all<br/>\nthe time for everything that she does is good for her?   If anyone has some<br/>\npointers on this I would appreciate it...&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course when a child does something they are excited about, they want to<br/>\nshare and get a response back. One that will make them feel good. I also see<br/>\nthe point of how praising just everything isn&#39;t good either. I watch what I<br/>\nsay and how I say it. I make sure to comment on how much work it looks like<br/>\nwent into that picture they just did or how I love the way they used color.<br/>\nSomething else beside just &quot;oh isn&#39;t that lovely, it&#39;s beautiful.&quot; Making<br/>\nsure I praise the effort instead of just the picture. I think that makes a<br/>\nbig difference. Not just the result but the process to get there. I think<br/>\nthat helps so much with their self esteem and not always concentrating on<br/>\nwhether the end result will be to anyone else&#39;s satisfaction. I do this with<br/>\nall comments, or I should say I try on most. Even with something like<br/>\ncleaning up the playroom without me asking. Instead of just saying great<br/>\njob, I will comment on how nice it was to do that because they know it makes<br/>\nme feel good and how much time it took them and how organized everything<br/>\nlooks. Hope this helps some.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"jmcseals SEALS","from":"&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Praise","postDate":"1050812780","msgId":65529,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjIyMkpRSGVGWHZqUU4wMDAwMmY2YUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":65524,"nextInTopic":65531,"prevInTime":65528,"nextInTime":65530,"topicId":65523,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think it often has to do with the type of praise being given.

Truthful <br/>\npraise, imho, can do no harm.  I also think there is such a thing as <br/>\noverdoing it, though.  For example, pulling out the bells and whistles for <br/>\n*every tiny little thing*.  &quot;WOW, you are the BEST child in the WHOLE ENTIRE <br/>\nWORLD&quot; is great here and there.  We over did those type of statements with <br/>\nour now 6 yr old and she went through quite a phase of letting EVERYONE know <br/>\njust how incredibly wonderful she was at any opportunity.  That tends to <br/>\nturn people off, even their friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI take every opportunity to tell my children when they are doing something <br/>\nright, nice, and so on.  &quot;Thanks for helping your sister with ________, that <br/>\nwas very nice of you.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you for _____ all by yourself!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven using gentle parenting techniques, it is so easy to pay more attention <br/>\nto the &#39;bad&#39; things.  I think the key is to *catch* our children being good <br/>\nand doing well and honestly comment on those things.  Offering unrealistic <br/>\npraise *can* be detrimental to a child who *may* grow up thinking they can <br/>\ndo no wrong.  There *may* also come a time, further down the road that they <br/>\nbecome fearful of sharing important situations or times of bad judgment in <br/>\nfear of what their parents might think of their *perfect* child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend whose parents treated her as if she were THE best child on <br/>\nearth.  She became pregnant at 14 and went to her choir teacher at school to <br/>\nconfide because she was so terrified of letting her parents down.  She truly <br/>\nbelieved that they thought she was perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to say this extreme situation is normal or even probable in <br/>\nevery circumstance.  I just think we owe it to our children to be honest <br/>\nwith them and let them know that we ARE proud of them for their <br/>\naccomplishments and will offer honest praise accordingly, but that they are <br/>\nalso allowed to make mistakes and that we will help them resolve their <br/>\nmistakes and still love them regardless.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 yr old made a rather large mistake recently and I calmly explained why <br/>\nI was upset.  A couple of days later, she wrote me a letter, apologizing, <br/>\nsuggesting a consequence very appropriate to the situation and offered an <br/>\nappropriate solution.  All on her own!  When I told her how proud of her I <br/>\nwas and how impressed I was and kept going, she finally stopped me and said, <br/>\n&quot;Goolleeee Mom, you don&#39;t have to over do it or I might do it again!&quot;  Of <br/>\ncourse, she was laughing but it was a wise lesson.  I LOVE learning things <br/>\nFROM my children! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?

They don&#39;t get <br/>\npraised for things that I tell them to do in order for me to get them <br/>\nto keep doing them, but they get encouraged when they do something on <br/>\ntheir own that they&#39;re happy about.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the thing you don&#39;t want to do with praise is try to get <br/>\nthem to do stuff by praising them.  In other words, you don&#39;t want to <br/>\nwithhold kind, affirming, words that tell your child she&#39;s a <br/>\nwonderful person until she does something that you consider <br/>\npraiseworthy.  You want to make sure she doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s worth <br/>\nmore as a person when she performs a certain way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut when she says, &quot;Look what I&#39;m doing, Mom!&quot;, she&#39;s looking for you <br/>\nto be excited with her.  If my husband painted the windows while I <br/>\nwas out and I came home and he showed me, all excited about the work <br/>\nhe did, he would be a little disappointed if I didn&#39;t say, &quot;Wow, you <br/>\ndid a really good job!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Heather&quot; <br/>\n&lt;moonlightmama@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi everyone, <br/>\n&gt; My daughter Kiele thrives on praise and I have heard two different <br/>\n </span></blockquote>views about praise and how it affects children.
