What does <br/>\nshe mention.......cyberschool for homeschoolers and how PA. is paying for it <br/>\nand maybe my state ID. will too. UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why can&#39;t people <br/>\nunderstand or at least stop bringing it up. First off my dd is 5 years old <br/>\nand if I was a PSer and held her back a year they all would have nothing to <br/>\nsay. But b/c I homeschool everyone has an opinion. I know, learn to deal, but <br/>\nit frustrates me so. Maybe I frustrate me since I am such a wimp w/ my mother <br/>\nI can&#39;t argue this w/ her. I usually say she is 5 and right where she should <br/>\nbe according to K. Usually shuts them up. Then I may have to go on and say if <br/>\nwe feel the need for a ciric in the future we will seek one. Usually the <br/>\nnaysayers are satisfied w/ this. I can see or hear the relief.<br/>\n<br/>\n       NICKI~ who is very PMSy and late to boot. GGGGRRRRRRR it is a get <br/>\noutta my way kinda day. &lt;VBG&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24044,"nextTopicId":24201}}
