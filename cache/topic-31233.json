I am lucky too I live in a state with really no requirements either so I don&#39;t have anyone to answer too either.

My 7 year old  (Cody) has never been to school and honestly is unschooled , always has been just it didn&#39;t hit me till a little while ago. I have trouble with my 9 year old (Chelsea) with reading. Cody asked shortly after he turned 6 if I was going to teach him to read. I asked if he was<br/>\nsure and he said yes and to my surprise picked it up fast. I am glad he did as I thought I did something wrong with Chelsea and was thinking what a horrible mother I was for not being able to teach her to read. Now I see she will blossom in her own time.

I live in Connecticut with my 5 children (Britt<br/>\n&gt;13, Nate 11, Chelsea 9, Cody 7 and Jake 2) and my husband John. We have<br/>\n&gt;been homeschooling for close to 5 years now. We pulled the kids out of<br/>\n&gt;school for several different reason from one being totally bored and<br/>\n&gt;unchallenged to Nate being beat up nearly everyday and just not socially<br/>\n&gt;doing well which as you can guess made his school work suffer. Chelsea<br/>\n&gt;only went a few weeks of kindergarten. And Cody has never been to school<br/>\n&gt;at all. So recently when he heard you had to raise your hand to go to<br/>\n&gt;the bathroom and couldn&#39;t enjoy a glass of juice when you want he<br/>\n&gt;decided school sounded more like a jail and he never wants to go. *L*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We had originally wanted to homeschool. Neither my husband or myself had<br/>\n&gt;a good experience in school at all. He left in 10th grade and I left in<br/>\n&gt;11 grade. He took the high school equivalency test and I took night<br/>\n&gt;school and then the GED. He went on to work construction and I traveled<br/>\n&gt;the country and then we got married at 18 years old. We have known each<br/>\n&gt;other since we were 11 years old.  Family was fully against us<br/>\n&gt;homeschooling when I began reading more on it when Britt was 18 months<br/>\n&gt;old. We then decided maybe a Waldorf school which of course got worse<br/>\n&gt;reviews. The running thought in his family is that we are trying to<br/>\n&gt;raise communists. How they came up with this is beyond me but my father<br/>\n&gt;in law still thinks this but at least is learning to keep his mouth<br/>\n&gt;shut.  Anyhow when we moved to CT from CA we decided to give the schools<br/>\n&gt;a try since the class size was so small. Didn&#39;t work as I said above. So<br/>\n&gt;we started our adventures in homeschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Over the past 5 years I have reworked our way of schooling several<br/>\n&gt;times. We started out doing school at home. I think it was more part of<br/>\n&gt;my de-schooling than theirs. I am glad that only lasted a few months.<br/>\n&gt;Next we tried Oak Meadow. I used that nearly 2 years until I had Jacob<br/>\n&gt;and found my kids actually did learn without the books. So from there on<br/>\n&gt;out we would use the Oak Meadow and Saxon math when we felt like that.<br/>\n&gt;Some days were more structured than others.  Lately though I just even<br/>\n&gt;think some of that is to structured and decided to toss in the towel<br/>\n&gt;after talking with other unschoolers about their day  and reading up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So I guess I am on another adventure. :0)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I noticed you all were talking about colleges. I suppose there are<br/>\n&gt;career where you need a college degree. My husband is in one of those<br/>\n&gt;jobs now working in NYC for one of the top 10 marketing and advertising<br/>\n&gt;firms and being upper management. He only like I said before has a 10th<br/>\n&gt;grade education and went to trade school for 9 months (he doubled on the<br/>\n&gt;course to go finish faster as we had 2 children at home to feed and debt<br/>\n&gt;piling up after our constructions company went under do to economic<br/>\n&gt;times during the gulf war). This got him in ground floor. He worked hard<br/>\n&gt;over the next few years and everything he is doing now is nothing he<br/>\n&gt;learned in school which cracks me up. It is all from working at jobs,<br/>\n&gt;keeping his ears and eyes open and learning new skills and taking those<br/>\n&gt;skills to a new job and learning more there. Companies have paid to have<br/>\n&gt;him trained in certain programs and to work certain machines and he is<br/>\n&gt;really the one who has benefited from this. Life really had been his<br/>\n&gt;school teacher.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now he hires people and he will not really look at their education<br/>\n&gt;background. He looks at their work experience and what they say they can<br/>\n&gt;do and then bring them in and is able to see who they are. Like he said<br/>\n&gt;it is rather easy to doctor up degrees and on the other side he has had<br/>\n&gt;guys work for him who have years of college behind them and they stunk<br/>\n&gt;or were unable to think for themselves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I know not every career is like this but hopefully it gives some hope to<br/>\n&gt;those who are worried. I know lots of people who are working in great<br/>\n&gt;jobs making really really good money and never went to college and some<br/>\n&gt;only have a GED some have trade school some just worked their way up and<br/>\n&gt;learned fast. One of our high school friends also lives here in CT and<br/>\n&gt;bought an extremely expensive home in a very well to do part of<br/>\n&gt;Connecticut and owns his own business in NYC. Oh all before he was 30<br/>\n&gt;too. Like me he left school early and just has a GED. Once more he is<br/>\n&gt;really happy and has a small family of his own.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The only one in our house at the moment talking jobs in my oldest,<br/>\n&gt;Britt. She currently wants to be a Reiki master and teach yoga classes.<br/>\n&gt;She knows she isnt going to make a milliion dollars doing this but she<br/>\n&gt;thinks she will be happy doing this. I told her fine by me. And I am<br/>\n&gt;currently trying to find a Reiki teacher for her. Actually we did find<br/>\n&gt;one (two actually) who are willing to teach her. If she likes it<br/>\n&gt;fine..if not fine. I am not that worried at the moment about college. We<br/>\n&gt;will do whatever it takes to get in one if the kids decided to go. My<br/>\n&gt;neighbor thinks I am nuts with this thinking. But then I think he is<br/>\n&gt;nuts for spending over $100,000 to send a kid to college up in Boston<br/>\n&gt;that dropped out because he never wanted to go in the first place. I<br/>\n&gt;think I am more concerned with the happiness end of success than the<br/>\n&gt;finanacial though I do hope my children will be finacially secure enough<br/>\n&gt;to take care of themselves. I just belive that if your happy in what you<br/>\n&gt;do you will be successful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok this is far longer than I had imagined posting. Sorry about that.
