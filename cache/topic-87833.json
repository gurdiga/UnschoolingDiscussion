NOT following any classrrom experience outside <br/>\nthe one practicum/student teaching, in a daycare center.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had no expertise in DOING anything.  Her first job was supervising other <br/>\nmaster&#39;s candidates in their student teaching.  She was teaching what she had <br/>\nnever herself done.  I&#39;d like to think she was the only one, but anyone who <br/>\nhas been around schools knows there are administrators who have never taught, <br/>\nand administrators who are there because they are crappy teachers, and the other <br/>\nstaff wanted to get them into an office, and away from the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nHers is NOT a master&#39;s degree deserving the level of respect of people who <br/>\nworked hard and discovered something new or provided a new method or idea.
