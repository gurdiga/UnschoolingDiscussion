MAKE them watch it, do not let them get  up.&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt was sarcasm but not.  And the other side of the coin is that if  they <br/>\ndon&#39;t want kids to eat candy, forbidding it is the WORST thing to  do. <br/>\n <br/>\nI should go back to that recommendation.  If people say &quot;my kid  would eat <br/>\ncandy until he threw up if I didn&#39;t stop him.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Hmmm....  How many times would he throw up?  How about MAKE  him eat candy <br/>\nuntil he throws up?&quot;  (That&#39;s if their goal is to create an  aversion.  School <br/>\ncertainly creates aversions left and right.)<br/>\n <br/>\n(Personally I think the &quot;ate X until he threw up&quot; is a boogey man, and  <br/>\nthrowing up is more likely from stress, fear or parental rant & shame  than from <br/>\nphysically eating.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":202326349,"authorName":"Jordan","from":"&quot;Jordan&quot; &lt;atj090@...&gt;","profile":"jamitory","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Coloring Books","postDate":"1117840698","msgId":106415,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVQRUVLSEJPQVBKSExJQ0VMQ0pDQUVJUENGQUEuYXRqMDkwQGdhbGF4eS5vY24ubmUuanA+","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTEwNy1EQVY4OEU1MzcyQzU4Q0Y4RkNGRUQ5NzhCRTA3MEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":106414,"nextInTopic":106416,"prevInTime":106414,"nextInTime":106416,"topicId":106404,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... picture of a witch (must have been Halloween).
