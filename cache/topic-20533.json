Your children will have the opportunity to see first hand what you<br/>\ndo, and they may begin to have their own work that they want to do.  I work<br/>\nmany hours throughout the day at home, and even though I don&#39;t get any cash<br/>\nrewards, I have goals and work that I want to accomplish. I like that my<br/>\nchildren, 5 and 8 create their own goals and work. I try to stay current on<br/>\ntheir latest interests and keep pertinent things around. I have to watch<br/>\nscheduling things with them, because they are so busy at home. My first year<br/>\nof homeschooling, I felt the need to make sure they were being social and<br/>\nhad things to do, and I enrolled them in too many things. What I found was<br/>\nthey  were more interested in staying home developing their own learning<br/>\nstrategies. We don&#39;t have a set schedule, but one of my children is a night<br/>\nowl, so I spend an hour or so with her usually at night reading, listening,<br/>\nsinging whatever, and the same thing happens with my other daughter in the<br/>\nmorning while the night owl sleeps. Sometimes we are all on the same<br/>\nschedule and that works out too. Just about every activity throughout the<br/>\nday can be considered &quot;school&quot; time, because the learning never ceases. They<br/>\nlearn without my interference and despite my interfere. I treasure and guard<br/>\nthe days we can stay home, because we all piddle around doing our own thing,<br/>\nbut we are also together, and these are the days we all seem to be the most<br/>\ncontented. Also, we usually end up doing something&#39;s in common, eating,<br/>\nsinging, dancing, writing, drawing, cooking, brick laying, whatever.<br/>\nFinally,to answer your question &quot;Do I need to plan some specific time to be<br/>\navailable or is it just all day long as needed?&quot;<br/>\nYou will have to try things to see what works best for your situation.
