We are a big family, 5<br/>\n&gt; boys ages 3 to 16, and for a few years now, I have felt that my now 8 yr<br/>\nold<br/>\n&gt; has some kind of learning disabilities.

(I&#39;ll just tie the other topic in here) With Cristina it<br/>\nwas so natural for her to read. With Tabitha she seems to need help. IMO,<br/>\nTabitha is more &quot;normal&quot;.  I see nothing wrong with teaching phonics to<br/>\nsomeone who really wants to read and isn&#39;t getting it. But the most<br/>\nimportant thing is reading aloud. I like Tabitha to sit next to me so she<br/>\ncan see what I&#39;m reading. Everyone&#39;s different....maybe Lynde is more<br/>\nphysical (kinesthetic) or auditory or whatever...rather than visual in her<br/>\nlearning.<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the name of that book that describes the 7 different ways of<br/>\nlearning?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know about the LD stuff.  Just being a slow reader at age 8 is no<br/>\nbig deal, even if she is a girl.  Have you ruled out vision problems?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for living in her sister&#39;s shadow &lt;sigh&gt;...this is the bane of Tabitha&#39;s<br/>\nexistence. Whatever Tabitha does well, Cristina did it better and did it<br/>\nfirst. I keep looking for some quality that I can encourage, but for all<br/>\ntheir differences, they excel at the same things (art, ballet, drama). What<br/>\ncan I do?  I&#39;m not going to discourage either of them from doing something<br/>\nthey love just because the other one does it, too. I just try to cheer them<br/>\nboth on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy computer is trying to crash again....Valerie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"MorelFam@aol.com","from":"MorelFam@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"hm1u3c37wByylP-76Y6ZCu0kaQhm7uMeXMoKRdx2nOqU6Qqoa3KJrZbOQRJSFyTP28UenEfiDA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"learning disability indicators?","postDate":"968988498","msgId":13164,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU0LmE1ZTgxZWEuMjZmMmYxNTJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13174,"prevInTime":13163,"nextInTime":13165,"topicId":13164,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" not to compare, but dd of mine cannot yet do the much simpler","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2106525965\">&lt;&lt;Just last night she complained that it took her so long to read<br/>\nsomething (Harry Potter)&gt;&gt;  <br/>\nnot to compare, but dd of mine cannot yet do the much simpler books than <br/>\nharry!  tabitha is really reading, just working on improving!  dd is not <br/>\n&quot;really reading&quot; yet...  but inches thru lets say the level just above go, <br/>\ndog go.  so that is where her frustration comes from.  and i can see that she <br/>\ndoes have it harder than others, but i dont yet have any indication that it <br/>\nis something more than just a slow progress.  anyone have ld indicators that <br/>\ni should rule out?  would hate to think that i could be making it a LOT more <br/>\neasy for her and am not....<br/>\ntia,<br/>\nerin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13296,"nextTopicId":13350}}
