It is an issue I have thought long and<br/>\nhard about power and control issues - not with much in the way of black and<br/>\nwhite solutions.  I am interested on what others on the list have to say<br/>\nabout thier philosophy in this area.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy initial tendancy as a parent was to operate strongly from the perspective<br/>\nthat they were children were little people and should be treated for all<br/>\nintensive purposes as much the same as adults as possible.  A very good<br/>\nfriend of mine has an older child, and he sort of passed this perspective on<br/>\nto me.  I still hold on to it dearly, as a reminder not to be patronizing or<br/>\nover protective.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, still... perhaps it is in part because I have been unclear about always<br/>\ntreating them with all the respect and dignity of an adult friend.... I find<br/>\nmyself searching for a way out of the power struggles with children that are<br/>\nacting difficult and uncooperatively.  And I am led to the conclusion that<br/>\nparental authority is still IMPORTANT, even in the midst of a treating our<br/>\nchildren with all the RESPECT of an adult, I still think they need me to be<br/>\nan unwavering authority and &quot;rule maker&quot; on some things other than just<br/>\nsafety and personal boundary issues.  In essence I think I still need to<br/>\nhave some, carefully thought out, expectations of their behavior.  For<br/>\ninstance, if my child was being cruel to a defenceless animal... I would be<br/>\nresponsable to protect the animal and to offer my child 1. a clear boundary<br/>\nabout how to treat animals and reasons behind that 2. a dis-incintive to<br/>\ncontinue the inappropriate behaviour(consequence for stepping over that<br/>\nboundary again), and 3. discusing or checking in to see what could be bihind<br/>\nthe behaviour so that attention can be given to helping to solve any<br/>\nunderlying problem that might be making the child angry...<br/>\nI just cant help but think that without this kind of guidance a child will<br/>\nbecome willful and stubborn in spite of being treated with as much love and<br/>\nrespect and resonableness as possible.  I could be entirely wrong here... it<br/>\nis just my experience so far in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am interested to hear what others have to say... and I by no means mean to<br/>\nimply that there is one way of doing things that is the right way for<br/>\neveryone...

2) they learn not to allow\nanother person to take advantage of them i.e. that they themselves have\nrights and should stand up for them if need be.&nbsp; imo since human nature\nis so complex it makes it very difficult to have a simple stance - but\nif we were able to make a simple stance life would be very boring:)\n<p><font face=\"Arial\">Also, I now believe it is important for children\nto &quot;surrender&quot;

both orientations, meanwhile,\nseem consistent with tactics that emphasize extrinsic control.&#39; (pg 228)\n<p>&#39;my hope, though, is that even the reader who doesn&#39;t accept every argument\noffered here, or who has doubts about the import of one or another piece\nof research, may nonetheless decide that there is enough evidence to justify\ncalling into question a set of beliefs and practices that affect us deeply\nevery day of our lives.&nbsp;

he\ntakes the processes of intentional dialogue - mirroring, validating, and\nemphasizing - and finds ways to make these responses part of his daily\ninteractions with his child.\n<p>he has tools for dealing with his child&#39;s frustrations, anger, and regressions\nthat turn these potentially disruptive emotional responses into occasions\nfor strengthening the child&#39;s wholeness and maintaining her connection\nto her parents, her immediate environment, and the larger world.&nbsp;\nand he has ways of promoting laughter, creative expression, spiritual depth,\nand moral character as his child begins to express the journey through\nlife.&#39;&nbsp;

Has anyone esle<br/>\non the list utilized it?  I am not sure yet that I agree with her on every<br/>\npiont, but there is enough USEFUL info in this book to cause a mini<br/>\nrevolution in the way I parent.  I have never come across a book that makes<br/>\nthings so unbelievably clear.  Most parenting books are one persons ideas of<br/>\nhow to deal with parenting... this is a philosophy with which to approach<br/>\nparenting (be firm, clear, and loving all at the same time)  which distills<br/>\ndown into guidelines about how to deal with the every-day events of living<br/>\nwith our children.  I can&#39;t possibly do it justice in one little post.<br/>\nEssentially it just talks about not yo-yoing back and forth between<br/>\npermissive(and loving) and authoritarian(but not loving), by adopting the<br/>\nattitude that it is possible to be both loving, supporting, (ie not scolding<br/>\never) AND steadfastly clear about boundaries and consequences at the same<br/>\ntime.  There are a lot of ideas about how to handle boundareis and<br/>\nconsequences for breaking the boundaries that at first seem a little &quot;harsh&quot;<br/>\nbut when combined with the gently loving way she advocates, are rather (for<br/>\nme personally) very effective.  Concepst such as no second and third<br/>\nchances, no negotiating with an unreasonable child, which I had always<br/>\nthought of as over controlling, now make perfect sence to me.  Anyways, as I<br/>\nsaid I cant possibly sum it all up in a neat little package...<br/>\n<br/>\nSuffice it to say, I highly recommend purchasing the book, or looking for it<br/>\nat your local library.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are respondig to the tougher consequences for getting out of<br/>\nline by surprising me with more responsable, capable, and self-motivated<br/>\nbehavior.  For instance, they now remember to put their tooth brushes away<br/>\nand wipe up any spilled toothpaste after brushing, and they dont fuss about<br/>\nhaving to brush after breakfast, they can clean up their toys with less and<br/>\nless direction from me... Before I used to stand over their shoulders<br/>\ninstructing them on each move.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps a little,<br/>\nJoshua</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"K WORTHEN","from":"&quot;K WORTHEN&quot; &lt;kworthen@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"2N8yG-kdsqXb5iM-VAr3ELjvhNPN65hUuKNjCSVZMguF41gpravfgRkD1ZxDEagR7ZEKLxiRfQmHeP2AYITyrH9KuGZm4jjCfKo","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Worries and Concerns (was old timers..)","postDate":"952390756","msgId":7023,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTUwMWJmODdkMCQ1ZDdiYjk0MCQwMWE1ODAxOEBuZS5tZWRpYW9uZS5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDkwLjE3NzY5OTguMjVmM2ViYTJAYW9sLmNvbT4gPDMuMC41LjMyLjIwMDAwMzA1MTk1ODUyLjAwN2MxOTQwQHBvcC50ZWx1cy5uZXQ+IDwzLjAuNS4zMi4yMDAwMDMwNjA2Mzk0OC4wMDdhYmRjMEBwb3AudGVsdXMubmV0PiA8MDA1MzAxYmY4N2NjJGU1ODc3MDgwJDM1ODM0MmQ4QEpvc2hIZWF0aD4="},"prevInTopic":7020,"nextInTopic":7031,"prevInTime":7022,"nextInTime":7024,"topicId":7019,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks so much to all of you for your support.

Ditto there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In retrospect , I think that being worried when you are starting<br/>\nsomething<br/>\n&gt; &gt; new is pretty healthy. After all, worry comes from caring and wanting to<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the right thing. In the case of our children, I think worry comes part<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; parcel with the job of parenting. We want to make sure that we are not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &#39;missing&#39; a piece of the learning pie. We don&#39;t want to mess up so we<br/>\n&gt; worry.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Time will help. Reading a lot about home education will help (there were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; few histories written about homelearning familes when I started but<br/>\nthere<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is a proliferation now!). But the most important thing is to have your<br/>\nown<br/>\n&gt; &gt; person mantra to remind yourself to accept how you feel as normal. Any<br/>\nnew<br/>\n&gt; &gt; job, any new relationship of merit  will cause you to worry and<br/>\n&gt; think...&quot;am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I doing the right thing? am I doing too much? am I doing too little?<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if it doesn&#39;t work out?&quot; Things are no different with homelearning, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; personally, after what I have seen in our family, it is only a win-win<br/>\n&gt; &gt; situation. There are ups-and-downs-and-in-betweens in the beginning just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like any new job . But things settle down over the years and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; being/learning together becomes second nature.  The secret is to let go<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; accept your &#39;stage&#39; of your &#39;new job&#39;. Remember that &quot;this too will<br/>\npass&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you have done a thorough job of convincing your family that this is<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; right thing I would assume that you know the pros of homelearning. I<br/>\nthink<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that you need to listen to the messages that you gave them. I kept a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; journal at the beginning and write down all the incredible learning<br/>\n&gt; moments<br/>\n&gt; &gt; , especially those where I was a spectator or facilitator. I would<br/>\nreread<br/>\n&gt; &gt; these and they  would buoy me up on the days where the self-doubt would<br/>\n&gt; nag<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the loudest. But time was the ultimate salve for me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why does your daughter want to go back to school? Maybe she is worried<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too!!! This may be a place for you to sit down and have a private talk<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; find out what her worries are...some of them may be the same as yours.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You could use this as an opportunity to share your fears and move beyond<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tell us how things are going and send more specific questions.

Ditto there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In retrospect , I think that being worried when you are starting something<br/>\n&gt; new is pretty healthy. After all, worry comes from caring and wanting to<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; the right thing. In the case of our children, I think worry comes part and<br/>\n&gt; parcel with the job of parenting. We want to make sure that we are not<br/>\n&gt; &#39;missing&#39; a piece of the learning pie. We don&#39;t want to mess up so we<br/>\nworry.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Time will help. Reading a lot about home education will help (there were<br/>\n&gt; few histories written about homelearning familes when I started but there<br/>\n&gt; is a proliferation now!). But the most important thing is to have your own<br/>\n&gt; person mantra to remind yourself to accept how you feel as normal. Any new<br/>\n&gt; job, any new relationship of merit  will cause you to worry and<br/>\nthink...&quot;am<br/>\n&gt; I doing the right thing? am I doing too much? am I doing too little? what<br/>\n&gt; if it doesn&#39;t work out?&quot; Things are no different with homelearning, but<br/>\n&gt; personally, after what I have seen in our family, it is only a win-win<br/>\n&gt; situation. There are ups-and-downs-and-in-betweens in the beginning just<br/>\n&gt; like any new job . But things settle down over the years and the<br/>\n&gt; being/learning together becomes second nature.  The secret is to let go<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; accept your &#39;stage&#39; of your &#39;new job&#39;. Remember that &quot;this too will pass&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you have done a thorough job of convincing your family that this is the<br/>\n&gt; right thing I would assume that you know the pros of homelearning. I think<br/>\n&gt; that you need to listen to the messages that you gave them. I kept a<br/>\n&gt; journal at the beginning and write down all the incredible learning<br/>\nmoments<br/>\n&gt; , especially those where I was a spectator or facilitator. I would reread<br/>\n&gt; these and they  would buoy me up on the days where the self-doubt would<br/>\nnag<br/>\n&gt; the loudest. But time was the ultimate salve for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why does your daughter want to go back to school? Maybe she is worried<br/>\n&gt; too!!! This may be a place for you to sit down and have a private talk to<br/>\n&gt; find out what her worries are...some of them may be the same as yours.<br/>\n&gt; You could use this as an opportunity to share your fears and move beyond<br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tell us how things are going and send more specific questions. We will try<br/>\n&gt; to help you through this period.<br/>\n&gt; I would say that most of us have been there...you are not alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Big hugs from<br/>\n&gt; Brooke in BC<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 08:23 AM 3/6/00 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;K WORTHEN&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kworthen@...\">kworthen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Brooke,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;            You wrote that in the begining you were worried yourself<br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; &gt;homeschooling.

I can&#39;t possibly do it justice in one little post.<br/>\n&gt; Essentially it just talks about not yo-yoing back and forth between<br/>\n&gt; permissive(and loving) and authoritarian(but not loving), by adopting the<br/>\n&gt; attitude that it is possible to be both loving, supporting, (ie not scolding<br/>\n&gt; ever) AND steadfastly clear about boundaries and consequences at the same<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; There are a lot of ideas about how to handle boundareis and<br/>\n&gt; consequences for breaking the boundaries that at first seem a little &quot;harsh&quot;<br/>\n&gt; but when combined with the gently loving way she advocates, are rather (for<br/>\n&gt; me personally) very effective.  Concepst such as no second and third<br/>\n&gt; chances, no negotiating with an unreasonable child, which I had always<br/>\n&gt; thought of as over controlling, now make perfect sence to me.

For instance, they now remember to put their tooth brushes away<br/>\n&gt; and wipe up any spilled toothpaste after brushing, and they dont fuss about<br/>\n&gt; having to brush after breakfast, they can clean up their toys with less and<br/>\n&gt; less direction from me...
