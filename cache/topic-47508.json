As the potter later<br/>\nsaid when I talked to him, &quot;It flunked the bounce test&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nTim flipped and started screaming, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry!&quot; over and over.  I<br/>\ntook a deep breath and said, &quot;Me too.&quot;  So we cried over it together, and<br/>\ncalled dh to apologize to him (because Tim wanted to get telling Daddy about<br/>\nit over with), and cried some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we got out the broom and dustpan, and swept up the mess, and called the<br/>\npotter who made it, and asked him to make us another, wrote him a check, and<br/>\nit was over.  (Oh, and we found a spot in a cupboard where the new one can<br/>\nlive!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I actually did it right for once, and didn&#39;t punish over<br/>\nsomething, and Tim felt what he was supposed to feel (sorrow over having<br/>\nbroken something we cared about) instead of what he shouldn&#39;t have had to<br/>\nfeel (fear and anger because I screamed at him or punished him).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help.

I saw confidence in Joseph that he can now handle things <br/>\ndifferently.

I&#39;m really glad that you&#39;re seeing progress!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an &quot;I did it and it&#39;s working!&quot; story, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTim and I were having fun last night, just goofing around, when he asked if<br/>\nI&#39;d read more of our current book.  I said, &quot;Sure, kick off your shoes and<br/>\nhop up on the sofa with me.&quot;  So, still feeling silly, he literally kicked<br/>\noff a shoe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt hit probably the only thing breakable in the entire house that&#39;s not in a<br/>\ncabinet; a ceramic goblet that belongs to his father&#39;s.  As the potter later<br/>\nsaid when I talked to him, &quot;It flunked the bounce test&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nTim flipped and started screaming, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry!&quot; over and over.  I<br/>\ntook a deep breath and said, &quot;Me too.&quot;  So we cried over it together, and<br/>\ncalled dh to apologize to him (because Tim wanted to get telling Daddy about<br/>\nit over with), and cried some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we got out the broom and dustpan, and swept up the mess, and called the<br/>\npotter who made it, and asked him to make us another, wrote him a check, and<br/>\nit was over.  (Oh, and we found a spot in a cupboard where the new one can<br/>\nlive!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I actually did it right for once, and didn&#39;t punish over<br/>\nsomething, and Tim felt what he was supposed to feel (sorrow over having<br/>\nbroken something we cared about) instead of what he shouldn&#39;t have had to<br/>\nfeel (fear and anger because I screamed at him or punished him).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help.

Our son Joseph has always had a <br/>\nhard time with anger and not knowing what to do with it. Usually the result <br/>\nhas been to hit his sister. It&#39;s something we&#39;ve been working on for awhile. <br/>\nI usually separate them and try talking to him and giving him other <br/>\nalternatives. He usually just doesn&#39;t want to talk or even admit he&#39;s mad. <br/>\nFor quite a while they couldn&#39;t play in his room because I can&#39;t see in <br/>\nthere and that&#39;s always when there was a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong story short. My daughter still knows how to push his buttons and we&#39;re <br/>\nworking on that too. They wre outside yesterday and playing with bubbles. <br/>\nJoseph had this big bubble wand and Sierra came in saying Joseph just threw <br/>\nit down on the ground and broke it. Joseph came right in with a scowl and I <br/>\nasked what happened. He said he threw it and it broke. I asked why and he <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Because Sierra made me so very mad!&quot; Well what a revelation that was. <br/>\nThat was the first time he&#39;s actually admitted that quickly what he was <br/>\nfeeling and why he did something. So I told him I understood he was mad and <br/>\ngood for him that he threw the bubble wand and didn&#39;t hit his sister. Well <br/>\nthe look on his face was priceless. He actually did something good!!! <br/>\nMeaning he was feeling awful and although the outcome wasn&#39;t great (broken <br/>\nbubble wand) he still did a right thing by not hurting. So I had a talk with <br/>\nhim and then with his sister who was pushing buttons and is so good at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the dinner table we talked about how he handled the situation and his dad <br/>\nwas very proud too. I saw confidence in Joseph that he can now handle things <br/>\ndifferently. My mom was there for dinner and had to throw in &quot;but he broke <br/>\nthe bubble wand&quot; to which we quickly said so what, his sister wasn&#39;t hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nMight not sound like a big deal but it was to us and also Joseph. He&#39;s been <br/>\nstruggling with his anger for a while now.
