An idea occurred to me to make a model of \nthe solar system and hang it from the ceiling. The idea was to use balloons and \npaper mache to make the solar system and then paint them and hang them from the \nceiling in our learning room. Has anyone done this and if so do you have any \nsuggestions as to the best way to go about this. Oh, of course we will talk \nabout each of the planets as we are making them, and the sun too. Also, if \nanyone knows of any good sites on the solar system with activies geered toward 3 \nand 5 year olds I would also appreciate that info. I have looked on the net but \nso far I can only find things for older children.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, \nCorallyn</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11459,"nextTopicId":11497}}
