Now, if I expect people to respect, and leave my family to do things \nour own way, which I do......I would expect the same from myself, towards \nothers.&nbsp; All of us are unique &amp; diverse , and I consider this a \nstrength...not all people are best suited to be SAHM&#39;s, but they are wonderful \nMothers.&nbsp; ANd some people , like my aunt, who didn&#39;t want to be a Mother, \nand wasn&#39;t....was a wonderful teacher of 2nd graders for 40 some years, and I \nknew how wonderful she was as a teacher, having stayed summers with her when I \nwas young.......some do this , some do that......if we can all see that there \nare ways of doing things that are not the same, but just as good for others, as \nour ways are for us....we may have a better chance of learning from, and living \nwith all types of people with all kinds of ways of doing things.&nbsp; I do \nthink that when we get stuck in the mindset that their is only one right way of \ndoing something, then we close the door of learning.&nbsp; Just my 10 cents. \nMichelle</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9755,"nextTopicId":9743}}
