He got the &#39;wait <br/>\nfor  your birthday/Christmas/&#39; or &#39;earn it - do chores, get high <br/>\ngrades, etc&#39;  for things he wanted as a kid. Part of his own healing <br/>\nis being able to do  for DS what he wished had been done for him.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband grew up in a very poor home, and he tends to show his love  to the <br/>\nkids by buying them things.  It makes him feel really good that he  can do <br/>\nthat for them.  I used to discourage him to do so, feeling the whole  &quot;spoiled <br/>\nthing&quot; until I realized how much it meant to him.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHe loves to be the one that takes them clothes shopping.  He used  to mandate <br/>\nwhat type of clothes they can get, and I would protest, but I&#39;ve  learned <br/>\nthat backing away and letting the KIDS express their feelings about it  has <br/>\nsoftened his heart tremendously.  We went to see Narnia at the mall and  JC Penney <br/>\nis having a HUGE sale, and HE took them around to each section and let  them <br/>\npick what they wanted while I went to the book store! :o)  Seeing how  happy <br/>\nthey were picking funky type stuff does so much more than me griping that  they <br/>\ndon&#39;t get to make their own choices.  <br/>\n <br/>\nNancy B.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111176,"nextTopicId":111119}}
