You got &quot;chits&quot; that could be<br/>\nused through out the building for things.  Kind of a barter system.  So you<br/>\ncould take you old books to the bookstore section and get a credit chit for<br/>\nthose books which you could in turn use at one of the other markets.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were hauling to horseshows at the time and I&#39;m blessed if I can remember<br/>\nwhat city or even state it was in.  But I remember thinking, &quot;dang, I wish<br/>\nwe had one of those near us!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda, who has boxes of books piled to the ceiling in the garage and the<br/>\ntool shed, not counting those in the house and the attic and in everyone&#39;s<br/>\nbedrooms.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PSoroosh@...\">PSoroosh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 22, 2002 11:03 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1976<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 4/22/2002 9:26:22 AM Pacific Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abtleo@...\">abtleo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, try getting away from the idea that you have to trade &quot;lessons&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe you all love your kids more than I do, but *I* can use a break now<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then, so I trade my teaching (of music) for lots of babysitting!
