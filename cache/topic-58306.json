HELP<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I always have this problem too. I put some stackable plastic drawers on<br/>\nwheels in my pantry, and labeled each drawer. DDs can move the stuff to<br/>\nwhere they are working, and everything has its place when they are done<br/>\n(not that the stuff ever finds its place). They also have a Little Tykes<br/>\ntable that they work at. In the summer time it is on the deck, and in the<br/>\nwinter it is in the kitchen. When this table starts overflowing, they<br/>\nmove to the kitchen table, which quickly gets lost.  I thought I had this<br/>\nproblem solved last week when we replaced our rickety, small,<br/>\nhand-me-down table with a HUGE heavy duty, solid wood hand-me-down table.<br/>\nNope! Just found more stuff to pile on it!lol. The one thing that has<br/>\nreduced some clutter, though, is giving each of my children a box with<br/>\ntheir name on to store their finished masterpieces in. So pictures stay<br/>\nup on the fridge for a couple of weeks, then get moved to the box or<br/>\nthrown out, whatever they decide. 3 dimensional projects were another<br/>\nstory. We just can&#39;t keep them all, so they keep their favorites, and I<br/>\ntake photos of them with the others, and then they keep the photos in<br/>\ntheir special boxes. A little bit of organization goes a long way,<br/>\nespecially in a house like mine where *nobody* likes to throw *anything*<br/>\naway.<br/>\nWende<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":134954462,"authorName":"ed hodgins","from":"&quot;ed hodgins&quot; &lt;ed.hodgins@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] J.
