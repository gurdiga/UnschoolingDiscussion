Visiting parents are <br/>\ngood for other kids to critique, to comment on their opinions on the mom&#39;s <br/>\nsexual value and whether the dads could beat up or be beat up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s altogether gross.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo when I see a homeschooling group moving toward kids&#39; activities (instead <br/>\nof family activities), and age divisions, it comes closer to playing school <br/>\nwithout a building than to the vision of unschooling which is so important to <br/>\nme personally.  I really believe in what I&#39;m doing.  It&#39;s not just a lack of <br/>\nbeing in school.

There was one <br/>\nthing that did stand out as far as something I hadn&#39;t really thought <br/>\nabout.  He discussed how so many adults don&#39;t like children.  Not <br/>\njust the ones who don&#39;t have them, or are obvious about it, but the <br/>\nones who teach them, or even have them.  It&#39;s something they feel <br/>\nguilty about, or won&#39;t admit to themselves, but it&#39;s obvious in their <br/>\nattitude.  He mentions that sweet syrupy voice and fake smiles that <br/>\nmany adults use on children.<br/>\nI think there are a lot of adults who have children, but don&#39;t really <br/>\nlike them.  Or they like theirs okay, but don&#39;t like others.<br/>\nI think it&#39;s obvious when people age segregate.<br/>\nI think it shows a lack of trust in children, and it&#39;s an obvious <br/>\nstatment against &quot;undesirable behavior&quot; that is *sure* to come with <br/>\ncertain aged children.<br/>\nI think it&#39;s okay not to like children very much.

The thing that got me <br/>\nabout the examples in New Mexico were the defenses that a couple of people <br/>\ncame up with.   Not good defenses.  One was &quot;the games we play say right on <br/>\nthe box 10 to adult or 12 to adult.&quot;  One was the dance school was forming <br/>\nclasses by physical development and ability.  Well no they weren&#39;t--they said <br/>\n&quot;6 to 8.&quot;  The developmental realities are across a range of 5 to ten or so, <br/>\nprobably, but they arbitrarily said 6 to 8.   So I was cranky not on behalf <br/>\nof my own kids (although Holly at nine was cut out of ALL those activities, <br/>\nnot that she&#39;d&#39;ve wanted to go to the teen group, although Marty at really <br/>\ntall, into puberty and almost 13 might have theoretically wanted to; he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t), but on behalf of kids with less courageous moms who would never <br/>\nquestion those numbers which were arbitrary at best and purposefully cutting <br/>\noff individual kids at worst.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the defenders of the 10 yr cut off for the gaming day said &quot;the 2-10 <br/>\ngroup...&quot; and I responded that there IS no &quot;2-10 &#39;group&#39;.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nSome six and seven and eight year olds can read great and can play games <br/>\nreally well.  Some ten year olds can&#39;t read well enough and have no interest <br/>\nwhatsoever anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my favorite parts of unschooling is the matching of humans to <br/>\ninterests without grade levels or ages.  I was really grumpy when the Society <br/>\nfor Creative Anachronism started adding age requirements to various offices.  <br/>\nWhen I joined teens could be officers (except for seneschal, the president of <br/>\nlocal groups who has to sign contracts) and could enter tournaments.  <br/>\nGradually more and more requirements were added until now kids are kids and I <br/>\nthink it&#39;s a huge step backward.
