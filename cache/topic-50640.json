It started with her having NO <br/>\nCONCEPT of a house with no central heating.  I told her some of the rooms <br/>\n(four of eight) had little freestanding gas heaters, and that was it, but <br/>\nsince it was adobe once it heated up it wasn&#39;t bad.   <br/>\n<br/>\nShe was from St. Louis and her parents had two homes.  One was a modern <br/>\n(60&#39;s; it was 1970), big, all-decked out house in a fancy neighborhood.  The <br/>\nother was her grandmother&#39;s downtown house with leaded, cutglas windows, <br/>\nfancy everything (turn of the century? 1880&#39;s?) and her mother was so rich <br/>\nher father had never had to have a job EXCEPT... every single night he went <br/>\nand slept at the downtown house to protect it from vandalism because of its <br/>\nfinancial value.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, at my own ratty house, she was thrilled.   We went to the drive-in <br/>\nmovies in a pickup owned and driven by a Real Indian (Jon Tsosie, my best <br/>\nfriend at the time), and the horn had to be honked (if it had to be honked) <br/>\nby putting a tableknife across the middle of the steering wheel to make <br/>\ncontact.   This, for the roommate from the East (she kept saying &quot;St. Louis <br/>\nisn&#39;t in the East&quot; and we&#39;d laugh and razz her more about it being east of <br/>\nNew Mexico and even east of Oklahoma!) was the most fun she&#39;d had.  For us it <br/>\nwas cheap and easy.  We&#39;d&#39;ve gone to the drive in in that old truck anyway.  <br/>\nWhat option?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo back to the kissing.  We got back to Albuquerque, 90 miles south of the <br/>\nexotic Espanola weekend, and she told all our dining hall friends how <br/>\nWONDERFUL my house was, but especially she said &quot;Her parents KISSED each <br/>\nother every time one of them left, and it was really sweet.  They&#39;re really <br/>\nin love.  My parents never even sleep in the same house.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThursday of that week I got my routine letter from home with a check for $5 <br/>\nor $10 in it, and because it was SO routine, I left it on my tray to read <br/>\nlater.  I forgot and it went down the rollers and into the dishwater.   I <br/>\nrushed back and asked for it, not caring about the letter but wanting the <br/>\ncheck.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was wet and messy, but the check was still good and the letter said my <br/>\nparents were getting a divorce and my mom had already started moving out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never written that down before.

We have tried classes.  In fact, we do <br/>\ntake an art class together with the other homeschooling family.  The <br/>\ninstructor of this class is great because she respects my son&#39;s way of <br/>\ndoing things, which is that he plays while creating.  For him, the process <br/>\nis the important thing and he doesn&#39;t care if he leaves with a product.  I <br/>\ncould be completely warped here, but I think it&#39;s great that he&#39;s more into <br/>\nthe process. And, the instructor is really cool because she makes offers to <br/>\nshow him things, but she doesn&#39;t insist and really lets him do his creative <br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have tried other classes, but he&#39;s just not interested in <br/>\nanything.  Mostly, he resents structure and control.  As we were going to <br/>\ntry out a new class he said to me, &quot;Mommy, I just don&#39;t want anyone to <br/>\ncontrol me.&quot;  For some things that I think he *may* be interested in, I ask <br/>\nhim to just try something and if he doesn&#39;t like it for any reason <br/>\nwhatsoever I let it go.  Our community center was offering a series <br/>\nof  classes for homeschoolers, and we signed up for a couple of them, <br/>\nmainly to meet other homeschoolers.  Unfortunately, they were a total <br/>\nbust.  I liked one of the programs, but he couldn&#39;t have cared less, and <br/>\nthe few other families that did sign up just did not click with my <br/>\nson.  Mostly, my son resented anyone telling him what to do, that it was <br/>\ntime to sit or stand or look at this or look at that.  Goodness, can you <br/>\neven imagine a kid like that in school?!?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat he needs is a recess class. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMJ<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

The <br/>\nfirst thing is to get out of the abyss. I hesitated going into therapy for <br/>\nmeds because I hate to use allopathy! But I was definately at the point where <br/>\nif I didn&#39;t do something I was going to completely break down. I happened to <br/>\nbe doing some studying and found that a vitamin deficiency could be a <br/>\nculpret. So I started taking the B&#39;s, C, and Calcium. Within two days, I felt <br/>\nMostly Normal. (That will be the title of my book one day) I suggest you talk <br/>\nto or go see a Nutritionist along with the therapist. I think that I was not <br/>\ntaking care of myself, and was pretty malnourished.

I had decided that I was the last person who <br/>\nshould be with them and that they should just go to school as I was the worst <br/>\nMom possible.

For him, the process <br/>\nis the important thing and he doesn&#39;t care if he leaves with a product.

This is the challenge!  I think I need to look harder.  We do have a <br/>\nhomeschooling family (school-at-home) that we do exchanges with.  They have <br/>\ntwo sons, one a year younger than my son and the other 3 years <br/>\nyounger.  The three of them play a lot together but they they see each <br/>\nother so much that my son needs breaks from them, and that, of course, <br/>\nleads us back to the original problem.  I admit that it&#39;s hard for me to <br/>\nsearch out people when I&#39;m feeling so funky.  I really have to rise above.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your kid-compassionate, mom-compassionate answer.

We live in a rural community and my son <br/>\ndoes not have a whole lot of friends but he really craves other kids.  He <br/>\njust loves to play and has a wild, extremely creative imagination.  Playing <br/>\nis all he wants to do, and that&#39;s just fine with me because that&#39;s what he <br/>\nwants to do.  The tricky part is 1) finding other kids for him to play <br/>\nwith, and 2) me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe, because I&#39;m feeling REALLY depressed lately.  We are going through some <br/>\nchanges in the house, namely that my husband of 22-1/2 years and I are <br/>\nrapidly moving apart, although we continue to live in the same house (we <br/>\ncan&#39;t afford not to).  DH doesn&#39;t sleep in our bedroom anymore.  We have <br/>\nhad a family bed since my son was born, and although my son has tried, he <br/>\nstill does not wish to sleep alone.  It&#39;s been a few weeks since DH moved <br/>\nto a different bedroom.  Our son has slept in DH&#39;s bedroom a couple of <br/>\ntimes, but mostly wants to sleep with me.  DH works a lot and has very <br/>\nlittle time to spend with our son.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the course of a week, I probably have maybe an hour to myself, if <br/>\nthat.  Sometimes two or three hours, but sometimes just as I get back home <br/>\nfrom driving my son to one of his friend&#39;s house, within a half an hour or <br/>\nso, DH gets home from work and, I&#39;m not alone anymore.  Sometimes I feel as <br/>\nthough I&#39;m on the brink of going just crazy.  I want to run away.  I feel <br/>\nthat I can&#39;t do anything right, that I suck as a mom.  I second-guess <br/>\neverything I do (which I realized earlier is a good thing to a point <br/>\nbecause questioning things is a way to grow).   I have so little patience <br/>\nand a much shorter fuse than I used to; I&#39;m tearful most of the time and I <br/>\nfeel little joy.  My life feels (and, I think, looks) chaotic and out of order.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my dilemma:  My son used to be in school and he absolutely HATED <br/>\nit.  But, I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;m the best person for him to be around.  As <br/>\nI&#39;m writing this, I can see that I need to see someone for some counseling, <br/>\nand I will set that up for myself this week.  But, what I am looking for <br/>\nfrom the participants of this list is a perspective that takes unschooling <br/>\ninto consideration.  I think if he went back to school, it would only <br/>\ncompound the suffering he&#39;s probably already enduring (i.e., the changes in <br/>\nour family and my unhappiness).<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this sounds like a big mess, and I&#39;m not sure I gave enough <br/>\ninformation for anyone to answer me.  So, please ask questions if you need <br/>\nto.  I should say that I feel that the big rift between DH and me was <br/>\ncaused by me and was his appropriate response to me.  Not that he has no <br/>\nresponsibility at all in this, but I feel that I precipitated this break up <br/>\nin a passive-aggressive way (the story of my life).  I should also say that <br/>\nDH and I plan to &quot;settle our affairs&quot; (clear up our debt), sell this house, <br/>\nand then buy enough land so that we can build two homes on it, one for him <br/>\nand one for me so that our son has us both around all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks very much for reading this and for any input you may have.<br/>\n<br/>\nMJ</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49924,"nextTopicId":50632}}
