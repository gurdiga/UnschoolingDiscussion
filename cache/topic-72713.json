I, personally, would <br/>\n&gt; have removed the stick from his hand myself right off the bat!  I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t waver when it comes to my kids&#39; safety.

To me also, the table manners are not nearly <br/>\nas big a deal as the safety issues.   I would ask the kid once to put the <br/>\nstick down, say something like, &quot;oh, watch it with the stick, we don&#39;t want <br/>\nanyone to get hurt, please put it down&quot;  Then if he didnt, just take it away from <br/>\nhim and say again, &quot; I dont want anyone to get hurt&quot;.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe table manners.. well, we don&#39;t have any at my house.. LOL.. nah, we do, <br/>\njust not the &quot;formal&quot;kind.   We do say &quot;pass the so and so&quot;, and my kids <br/>\nusually thank me for a meal or maybe just tell me how much they liked it.  But, they <br/>\ndo that of thier own accord.   Maybe because they have always heard me say <br/>\nsomething along those lines to other folks when we eat at thier houses.  Maybe <br/>\nit&#39;s just because they appreciate it and want to tell me.  My Daddy once told <br/>\nus, &quot;your Moma worked very hard on this meal, you should thank her for it&quot;    <br/>\nAnd, he would always thank her for the meal or say how good it was.  I agreed <br/>\n100% with him and I DID appreciate my Mom for cooking our food, so I always <br/>\ntold her, and I still do.   I always thank my husband when he takes us out for <br/>\ndinner ( or whomever pays for the meal)  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t do the &quot;excused from the table&quot; thing.  It&#39;s just something we never <br/>\nadopted as good manners practice.  Maybe it is a regional thing, but folks <br/>\naround here don&#39;t usually excuse themselves.. Well, if you get up in the middle <br/>\nof a meal, you would say &quot;excuse me&quot;  the same as you would do if you had to <br/>\nleave in the middle of anything.    But after eating, folks usually sit around <br/>\nand talk or get up and leave, whichever they want to do.   Sometimes the kids <br/>\nwant to stay and talk, sometimes they eat  and  then  back to whatever they <br/>\nwere doing.   If they are REALLY into something, but they are also hungry, they <br/>\nwill just get thier food and take it with them to eat as they continue thier <br/>\n&quot;thing&quot;.     If we are having a sit down meal, they usually opt to sit down <br/>\nwith us and enjoy the family conversation.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI would think, if your family usually excuses themselves after their meal, if <br/>\nthe kid continues to come around and have meals with your family, he will <br/>\npick up on that and probably start to do it too.   And, if he doesn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nstress over it.

It might seem <br/>\nlike a small difference but it&#39;s actually a whole new paradigm.  You <br/>\ncould see them as little brutes who need to be &quot;corrected&quot; and <br/>\nmolded into respectable humans, or you can see them as people who <br/>\nmean well but lack our broader experience.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So, when he shovelled his food <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in and made to dash, I just responded.

And so I talked to him about <br/>\nit. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, if you mean what you are putting out here, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think you&#39;re in the wrong place to solicit the kind of support <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and advice <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you appear to want.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What?!?!??! Tell me what sort of advice I appear to want. After <br/>\nreading the things I appear to have said about this. &quot;Going to have <br/>\nto THINK about how I respond&quot;   &quot;Talked myself into a better mood&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if after reading how shocked some of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; us are, you can see the flaws in your thinking, then you have come <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; perfect place!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, that&#39;s happening.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I were him and you came across like this to me, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>listen to you <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; either!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So, back to the branch swinging thing. If someone said &quot;Hey, put the <br/>\nbranch down. Someone&#39;s going to get hurt&quot; would you listen? Because <br/>\nhe wasn&#39;t listening then, either. Point being: a kid swinging a <br/>\nbranch doesn&#39;t necessarily see that he could hurt someone. But the <br/>\nadults, standing back and watching other, younger kids in the area  <br/>\nmight see something he doesn&#39;t see. But if he doesn&#39;t listen, what is <br/>\none to do?  Yes, grab the younger ones, but it is perfectly valid to <br/>\nrequest the branch not be swung right now, right there. There&#39;s <br/>\nNOTHING WRONG with telling a kid to stop doing something that is <br/>\ndangerous. But how, if he doesn&#39;t LISTEN?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I say the next time he comes to visit, offer him a hug and some <br/>\n </span></blockquote>cookies and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; milk and let the kids play!

Were we really in a hurry? No...except <br/>\n&quot;they were hungry and it was past dinner time, and their folks were <br/>\n&quot;expecting them back, etc. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote the following about what I will do in future, when the friend <br/>\nis over to play and acts obnoxious:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Agreed. If we do end up having him around more, I&#39;ll definitely be <br/>\n&quot;spending time with him and Robby together, and he&#39;ll hear more from <br/>\n&quot;(us) about how things are done around here. I&#39;m going to have to <br/>\n&quot;think EVERY time, though. Like, stop and THINK. Because,  <br/>\n&quot;just bolting <br/>\n&quot;down one&#39;s food and dashing is irritating. The rudeness of it is <br/>\n&quot;shocking. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you see that I was saying &quot;I just told him to plop it back down <br/>\nagain and ask permission to leave, because what he did was so <br/>\nshocking to me.&quot; ??? IOW, I recognized my tendency to Jerk The Knee, <br/>\nand aknowledged that I should THINK of better ways to deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you see that? Yeah, his getting up and dashing was obnoxious <br/>\nACCORDING TO MY DEFINITION...but also according to the table manners <br/>\nthat are common around here. People ask to be excused. It&#39;s polite in <br/>\nthis area. I had honestly never seen a kid do that. Eat, and dash <br/>\noff. And so I responded without THINKING.<br/>\n<br/>\nRespect goes both ways. It was disrespectful of me to just order him <br/>\nto plant it, but it was disrespectful of him to gobble his food and <br/>\nsplit without acknowledging the dinner or the hostess. But I could <br/>\nhave handled it better. Maybe the way you suggest.

I don&#39;t practice this <br/>\n </span></blockquote>now. When <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; our children are done eating they get up and clean off their plates <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and put <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; them in the sink or dishwasher.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My kids say &quot;May I be excused&quot; Or &quot;thank you for the food&quot; and take <br/>\ntheir dishes to the sink. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is what happens when they (your <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; children) dont ask to get up or leave? Is there a punishment? From <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the sounds of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; your post this is a serious infraction in your home. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which is why I said I&#39;d have to stop and THINK rather than just <br/>\nresponding automatically. We have a &quot;golden rule&quot; rule at our <br/>\nhouse &quot;Do Unto Others As You Would Have Them Do Unto You&quot; IOW, if a <br/>\n10 year old boy had spent a chunk of time preparing (something) for <br/>\nthe enjoyment of other people, would he rather people say &quot;Very Nice. <br/>\nThanks for doing that&quot; or just look at it and then leave? That is <br/>\nwhere this leaving the table practice comes from. Someone has spent a <br/>\nchunk of time preparing the food. It is good manners to at least <br/>\npause long enough to ask if one can leave the table. It&#39;s also common <br/>\npractice in these parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, our kids have been taught (yes, taught) to say &quot;Thank you <br/>\nfor the food. May I please be excused?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this boy hasn&#39;t had that rule in his life. He hasn&#39;t been taught <br/>\nthat you acknowledge the work that went into blessing the people <br/>\nsitting around the table. And so, having him around will mean <br/>\nTHINKING things through. Most assuredly, I will be explaining why we <br/>\ndo such and such, rather than simply knee-jerk responding. At the <br/>\ntable, when he just bolted, as I said before, it was surprising, and <br/>\nI simply responded without THINKING why he was doing such a thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids know table <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; manners but that is not one of them. When we are in a restaurant <br/>\n </span></blockquote>they do ask or <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; announce that they need to go to the restroom etc.. I have never <br/>\n </span></blockquote>told them to do <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so they just do. They dont lay all over the table when they eat nor <br/>\n </span></blockquote>do they <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; eat like wild dogs (well minus the 1 yr. old ).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So, how do you stop them from splaying themselves out over their <br/>\nplates like hungry dogs? What if they wanted to eat that way? Do you <br/>\ncorrect them at any time for bad table manners? And how do you do so? <br/>\nNot based on THEIR wishes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So, when he shovelled his food <br/>\n&gt; &gt; in and made to dash, I just responded. I wasn&#39;t rude. Just <br/>\n&gt; &gt; said &quot;Please sit back down and ask to be excused. That&#39;s how we <br/>\n </span></blockquote>do it <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; around here.&quot; or some such. And he did.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; HUH?<br/>\n&gt;   Excused from what?  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Its not the idea of it, it is how I read the posts. To <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; me kids <br/>\n&gt; &gt; are kids and when something seems off we speak but do this do <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that sure <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t sound child driven/centered to me.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, but I also don&#39;t see anything wrong with reminding him that there <br/>\nis such a thing as saying thank you and acknowledging the person who <br/>\nhas invited him to the table and fed him. Someone else has said maybe <br/>\nhe&#39;ll realize there&#39;s someone in the world who gives a rat&#39;s a$$ how <br/>\nhe carries himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ll add my hearty &quot;Amen!&quot; to that. He simply does not hear <br/>\n </span></blockquote>when an <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; adult of any stripe speaks to him.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Stripe??<br/>\n&gt; So you out rank him?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Figure of speech. Here, if a different wording will help you feel <br/>\nbetter &quot;He simply does not hear when any adult speaks to him.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for outranking him: On Pool Day, I had the keys to his ride home <br/>\nin my hand. Maybe I DID outrank him, eh? I don&#39;t know who outranks <br/>\nhim when he&#39;s swinging a branch around the faces of two year olds, <br/>\nbut someone should say SOMETHING FORCEFUL to the child, or someone&#39;s <br/>\ngoing to get hurt. And yet, it took a father (not his, nor his <br/>\nmother) taking the branch in his hand, establishing eye-contact, and <br/>\ntelling him to cease, for him to actually listen. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I am having an off night but I just do not <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; understand why this boy seems to bother you so much.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why do you think this boy bothers me SO much? He has done things that <br/>\nirritate me. He was extremely irritating at the pool. And I was <br/>\nasking advice. What does a family do, when kids join activities, <br/>\nwhose behavior is irritating, rude, dangerous? Something, I&#39;m sure. <br/>\nWe don&#39;t want to say &quot;No more of that boy&quot; because he is friendly and <br/>\ninteresting. But I also don&#39;t want him here simply irritating me <br/>\nevery time he&#39;s over<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is why I said my own self, in hanging with him, I&#39;d be THINKING <br/>\nit out, whenever such an irritation did happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiC</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132394532,"authorName":"Have A Nice Day!","from":"Have A Nice Day! &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"litlrooh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: friends over/ rules & discipline","postDate":"1055059601","msgId":72848,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTIwMWMzMmQ5NCRlNTM4Y2FlMCQ1YzU3NTI0NEBhby5sb3AuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjExUFBHUTl3SjZqQVYwMDA4MGQ5ZkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72843,"nextInTopic":72856,"prevInTime":72847,"nextInTime":72849,"topicId":72713,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s not your job to teach him anything!

And he did. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you are truly trying to help this child, Heidi and although it would <br/>\nnot be the point of contention for me or my family, if table manners are for <br/>\nyou than perhaps this child shouldn&#39;t eat at meal time with your family. I&#39;ll <br/>\nadmit when I read this portion of the post I was taken aback a little, because <br/>\nI never would have assumed you to be so sticky as to require excuse to leave. <br/>\nYou post so often that it just threw me a little. In fact, I wasn&#39;t sure if I <br/>\nwould post on it initially. <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with most of the responses as far as the table manners go though. <br/>\nNever in my life have I requested to be excused from a table. I may, at dinner in <br/>\na restaurant with a large party, say excuse me but that is just being polite, <br/>\nnot asking permission. As far as my children go, they have table manners, in <br/>\nthat they don&#39;t chew with their mouths opens or talk when their mouths are <br/>\nfull, but I would be fully offended if anyone required them to ask permission to <br/>\nbe done or leave the table. At other people&#39;s houses, they say thank you and <br/>\nalways clear their portion of the table, but that&#39;s about being considerate of <br/>\nthe host/ess. Yet we are always complimented on how they act during meals. I <br/>\nlaugh, because they CHOOSE to be considerate, not because we REQUIRE it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI still think that your intentions to help this child assimilate to your <br/>\nfamily&#39;s environment stem from a loving place in your heart and not all about <br/>\npower. I see that from your posts about trying to get to know these boys more. I <br/>\nbelieve you when you say you know your children enjoy their friendship and you <br/>\nare willing to do what it takes to keep them around. <br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda - still wishing luck to Heidi and her children&#39;s friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"jmcseals SEALS","from":"&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: friends over/ rules & discipline","postDate":"1055047698","msgId":72839,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjExUFBHUTl3SjZqQVYwMDA4MGQ5ZkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72838,"nextInTopic":72843,"prevInTime":72838,"nextInTime":72840,"topicId":72713,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She has a daughter that I must say I don&#39;t enjoy being around.<br/>\nI feel like this child has possibly some type of autism that the mother<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to want to recognize. The daughter can be sweet one moment and<br/>\nrude and physically aggressive the next. My kids have tried to play with<br/>\nher. She doesn&#39;t really play &quot;with&quot; anyone. She&#39;s very antagonistic with no<br/>\nvisible comprehension of the results. I&#39;ve tried and my kids have tried and<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t work. I only see her in groups now where my kids can keep a<br/>\ndistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids really do enjoy the company of this little boy, I would try<br/>\nharder so that he can understand how people are with people they enjoy being<br/>\naround. Just saying a few words to him about not leaving the table or not<br/>\ngrabbing is not enough. You didn&#39;t say how much you really talk to him so<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if you take more time with him alone to get to know him. Years<br/>\nand years ago I was having a hard time with my soon to be step daughter. I<br/>\nwas in counseling and I was told that I could be the one person to make a<br/>\ndifference in this childs life. She was having a hard time with everyone<br/>\nelse, she needed someone to try and understand her. It wasn&#39;t about how I<br/>\nwas feeling about her behavior. It was about her. Now this was family so a<br/>\nbit different but I made a solid effort every day and even though she&#39;s no<br/>\nlonger my step daughter, I talk to her all the time and she spends holidays<br/>\nhere and I adopted (not literally) her as my 5th child that I always wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind out who this little boy is and talk to him, a lot. Talk about what you<br/>\nsee and what you do and what others do in circumstances. I have a feeling<br/>\nthat he hears often one liners of what he should or shouldn&#39;t do but no more<br/>\nthan that. So hearing it from you probably has no bearing on him. Being this<br/>\nlittle kids friend may make a difference. But then again, it&#39;s a matter of<br/>\nif you want to and if your kids really like him around. There&#39;s nothing<br/>\nwrong with not wanting to be around people you don&#39;t enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":66835036,"authorName":"RJHill241@aol.com","from":"RJHill241@...","profile":"rjhill241","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: friends over/ rules & discipline","postDate":"1055005493","msgId":72749,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5Ni4xYjcwY2ZjNC4yYzEzNzUzNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":72731,"nextInTopic":72755,"prevInTime":72748,"nextInTime":72750,"topicId":72713,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/7/03 5:40:46 AM Pacific Daylight Time, ...

I can totally identify with what <br/>\nhappened though. More often than not in my exprience, those are the kids who stick <br/>\naround the longest. They are the kids screaming out for attention and will do <br/>\nanything for it. I&#39;ve noticed that bullying or other posturing often comes from <br/>\nthe kids who don&#39;t have a voice in their own homes. It&#39;s actually so sad and <br/>\nyes they often want boundaries, but NOT the boundaries our unsubbed poster was <br/>\nspeaking of. They simply want to know that someone on the planet gives a crap <br/>\nabout them enough to tell them so. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy hubby loves it when Jenny Jones or one of the other talk show people has <br/>\nthe ones with kids who are so bad they get sent to boot camp. He&#39;s an x-marine <br/>\nand although he&#39;d die that I&#39;m saying this, always gets teary eyed when the <br/>\nhead of the boot camp gets in those kids faces and breaks them down. His point <br/>\nis also that all those kids are looking for is someone who will say, you are <br/>\nworthy enough to be told you can&#39;t be an a$$hole. He always makes me laugh. He <br/>\nthinks it would be the best job in the world to save kids from themselves <br/>\nbecause no one else has bothered. He often thinks the parents should have to go <br/>\nthru some kind of boot camp to understand their own role in why their children <br/>\nfeel so unworthy and act out accordingly. We agree that no kid just wakes up one <br/>\nmorning a bad a$$. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say don&#39;t give up on him yet. You have the opportuniy to make a <br/>\ndifference in his life. By no means do I say keep him around if you and your kids get <br/>\nfed up or the dynamics become all about him either. I just think your whole <br/>\nfamily has an opportunity to learn so much from this child and vice versa. Good <br/>\nluck to you. Let us know how it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":93802122,"authorName":"Tim and Maureen","from":"Tim and Maureen &lt;tmthomas@...&gt;","profile":"wisdom0007","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: friends over/ rules & discipline","postDate":"1054993662","msgId":72731,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWIwMWMzMmNmYiQ2MDZlZTY4MCQxODU1NDUxOEBjYS5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGJic21lNCtlY2JzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":72725,"nextInTopic":72749,"prevInTime":72730,"nextInTime":72732,"topicId":72713,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
