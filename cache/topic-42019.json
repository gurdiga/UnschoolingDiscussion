Check at <br/>\nyour chiropractor&#39;s office to see if they know of a doctor who will <br/>\nwrite you a medical exemption to vaccinations.  A naturopath who is <br/>\nan MD would do that, as would a MD who is a homeopath or anyone who <br/>\nsupports alternative medicine.  I found two doctors who would be <br/>\nwilling to do that.
