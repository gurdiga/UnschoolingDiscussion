I&#39;ll bet there&#39;s a lot of truth to<br/>\nthat one.  I was talking with a friend who has really good kids in high<br/>\nschool.  She was saying that it isn&#39;t geeky anymore to play in the band and<br/>\nthat the kids don&#39;t categorize and torture other kids for their choices<br/>\nanymore.  I asked her if she really knew that to be true.  She said &quot;Well,<br/>\nit isn&#39;t as bad as it was when we were there.&quot;  Could that be true?  Or is<br/>\nshe looking through rose colored glasses....because she is only seeing it<br/>\nthrough what her kids share with her now?
