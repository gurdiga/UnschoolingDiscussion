It is not how I meant it <br/>\nalthough I understand why you took it the way you did.  In my first <br/>\nthought I was not refering to &quot;you&quot; as a singular specific.  I was <br/>\nattempting to refer to a posting style.  It just didn&#39;t come off that <br/>\nway and I&#39;m sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second thaght was a question.  And I&#39;ve read lots of your posts and <br/>\nthey have come across as you saying that if you truly respect your <br/>\nkids you MUST be unschooling.
