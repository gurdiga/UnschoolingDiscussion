She <br/>\nrecognizes a few (like c, e, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, s, t, u, v, w, x, <br/>\ny, z, which as you can see are very similar to their uppercase twins (except <br/>\nfor e and g which she has learned recently)).<br/>\nMy 13 year old son went to public school until 3rd grade.  He had trouble <br/>\nwith his letters even in 3rd grade.  He was still asking me how to make <br/>\ncertain letters when he wrote things, and his reading was terrible!  His <br/>\nolder brother had no problems with this, and his younger brother was reading <br/>\nwhen he started Kindergarten---he taught himself---so I was really concerned <br/>\nabout him.  At that time, I had not read any of John Holts materials, or GWS, <br/>\nI had never even heard of homeschooling (except for people that lived in the <br/>\nArctic!)<br/>\nIn the middle of 4th  grade, we pulled all of the kids out of school.  For a <br/>\nfew months we did school-at-home, which we quickly burned out on.  I spent <br/>\nthe summer reading anything I could on homeschooling, and found some books on <br/>\nJohn Holt.  A strange thing was that my 4th grader found some books during <br/>\nthe summer also (the Boxcar Children, Animorphs, and others) and suddenly <br/>\ntook off reading.  Now he reads great, just like his two brothers.  Of <br/>\ncourse, I never had one wait as long as my daughter is (she will be 8 in <br/>\nOctober), but since I witnessed her brothers become strong readers on their <br/>\nown, I am more calm and relaxed waiting for her to learn to read, then I <br/>\nwould have been with them.  (Except when my ps teacher parents begin to worry <br/>\nout loud about how old she is and not reading!!!!&lt;g&gt;But that is just my old <br/>\ninsecurities popping up)<br/>\n     I really think that your son will learn the lower case letters in time, <br/>\nas he matures.
