Anyway, she","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-247269416\">Adriane is 12 and is a superbly confidant youngster who happens to be more<br/>\ninterested in make-up and clothes than just about anything else &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>\nAnyway, she is very involved in 4-H and it requires a significant amount of<br/>\nmath in the paperwork (keeping feed records, budget sheets, etc.).  For the<br/>\nlast 3 years, I have talked her through the problems, pointing out patterns,<br/>\netc. and this year she has been able to do it independently, not with great<br/>\njoy but without major problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuesday, we are driving back from Fort Worth after spending 4 days living in<br/>\na showbarn with goats.  We are stinky and tired but having a good time.  Out<br/>\nof no where, Adriane says &quot;829 plus 829 is 1658&quot;.  I agreed and asked what<br/>\nmade her think of that.  &quot;The time was 8:29&quot;.  Ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdriane gets out a notebook and pen and starts adding 829 over and over and<br/>\nover.  Suddenly she says &quot;Hey there&#39;s a pattern.  The last number is always<br/>\none smaller than it was before&quot;.  I&#39;m thinking that I had explained this to<br/>\nher many times before but luckily kept my mouth shut.  She has now spent 3<br/>\ndays adding 829 and just enjoying the pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had told her about the pattern many times and shown it to her and she<br/>\nforgot it.  She discovered it once for herself and will remember it forever.<br/>\nThat&#39;s why we unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55269,"nextTopicId":55466}}
