I quite <br/>\nunderstand that they might have better things to do.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Anyone who waits for a guarantee of 15 years out from now isn&#39;t being<br/>\n&gt; realistic, AND will miss all opportunity to unschool from hesitation <br/>\n&gt; while a child is<br/>\n&gt; growing older every day.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>People keep saying &quot;no guarantee&quot; to me when I haven&#39;t asked for a <br/>\nguarantee.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;-=-So I was trying to encourage people to show me real<br/>\n&gt; enthusiasm if it was out there. -=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This just really grates on my emotions.<br/>\n&gt; You can certainly look for what you want to find, but the many layers <br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; antagonism of this sort of statement is hard to bear.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, Sandra, I didn&#39;t mean to make your day harder. I thought when I <br/>\nstarted this topic that maybe I ought to first run up the white flag <br/>\nand say &quot;This is Not, Repeat, Not, an Attack. Nobody needs to get out <br/>\nthe long guns and run me off.&quot; Then I thought, nah, that&#39;s just being <br/>\nparanoid and starting the conversation in an antagonistic way. But <br/>\nmaybe I should have after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assure you, I&#39;m not antagonistic. I&#39;m curious, open and want to <br/>\ngather all the information I can and think about it carefully (in fact, <br/>\ncritically, if that&#39;s not too war-like a word). I&#39;m sorry if my <br/>\nlanguage doesn&#39;t successfully convey my attitude. Perhaps it would help <br/>\nto imagine that I was your best friend speaking in a gentle, <br/>\nwell-meaning tone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also aware that the relevant information is not degrees or grade <br/>\npoint averages, but people&#39;s happiness and level of satisfaction with <br/>\ntheir lives.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;My kids don&#39;t write about unschooling one single bit.  I&#39;m pretty <br/>\n&gt; sure it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; because they were never in school and have been home all their lives, <br/>\n&gt; so<br/>\n&gt; unschooling is not a big deal to them, it&#39;s not a part of their lives <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; analyzed and discussed.  It just IS their lives.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is why it would be interesting to hear from people who have been <br/>\ngrown up long enough to think about it.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;-=-I KNOW unschooling parents are enthusiastic, but so are every <br/>\n&gt; other kind<br/>\n&gt; of homeschooling parent and quite a few parents of kids in schools.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s nice to hear from the lab rat and not just the<br/>\n&gt; scientist.-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; #1 my children are not lab rats.<br/>\n&gt; They are real, whole, un-labbed people.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to dehumanize your children or mine or anyone <br/>\nelse&#39;s.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;#2, if you think every other kind of homeschooling parent is as <br/>\n&gt; enthusiastic<br/>\n&gt; as unschoolers, maybe that&#39;s where your research ought to start.  <br/>\n&gt; There is a<br/>\n&gt; HUGE undercurrent of burn-out and resentment throughout the Christian<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling movement.  They pray about it a lot.   They try to keep <br/>\n&gt; it secret.  There<br/>\n&gt; are VERY many curriculum-using families who are doing irreparable <br/>\n&gt; damage to<br/>\n&gt; the relationships between parents and children.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now that IS interesting, and I didn&#39;t know it. But since I was never in <br/>\nany possible universe going to be a Christian Homeschooler, I will skip <br/>\nthat branch of research.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;-=-Come to think of it, if anybody knows where to read a well <br/>\n&gt; thought out<br/>\n&gt; critique of what worked and didn&#39;t work in somebody&#39;s unschooled<br/>\n&gt; childhood that would be really interesting to see too.-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Heaven forbit someone find you something you claim to want, just for <br/>\n&gt; you to<br/>\n&gt; declare it &quot;not well thought out.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re rejecting more than you&#39;re accepting, it seems.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>By &quot;well thought out,&quot; I mean that the person meant to sit down and <br/>\nthink for a while about unschooling in particular and wasn&#39;t just <br/>\nrandomly reminiscing. I didn&#39;t realize they were fighting words.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Maybe if you go to google and look up some negative words and <br/>\n&gt; homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; or unschooling you&#39;ll find the seamy underbelly (or whatever) you&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; looking<br/>\n&gt; for.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now, why is it that you suppose that I&#39;m looking for a &quot;seamy <br/>\nunderbelly&quot; when all I&#39;ve asked for is positive reports?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;If you haven&#39;t been to an unschooling conference, maybe you should <br/>\n&gt; go and<br/>\n&gt; meet some unschoolers in person.

That&#39;s not <br/>\n&gt; necessary, as<br/>\n&gt; there are live unschoolers in the world.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps I should have said &quot;every kind of homeschooling parent who <br/>\ncommunicates in print.&quot; I&#39;ve been to a couple of workshops - in fact I <br/>\nmet you at the one in Chicago- and to the Wisconsin Homeschooling <br/>\nConference. And I read a lot of books, which<br/>\nARE more abstract than real life, but one gets information where one <br/>\ncan. I&#39;m certainly grateful to people who are willing to share first <br/>\nhand experiences - the more the better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could enthuse about perfect moments my children and I have had or <br/>\nreally interesting things they said, and maybe I will someday.

He&#39;s almost thirteen and we <br/>\nstarted unschooling when he was 11. I got great advice at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, some kids measure themselves against others. My son was worried that if he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t quantify his progress in a subject, then he wasn&#39;t learning. As a result, I told him <br/>\nif he wanted to floow his original curricula, he could. So I would pull it out in the mornings <br/>\n(several different books) and put it on the table. But I told him that I wasn&#39;t going to <br/>\n&quot;enforce&quot; his doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis riled him up some. He thought he &quot;should&quot; be pushed to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the course of a year, he did less and less of the curricula. He became more and more <br/>\nengaged in his own interests. Still, occasionally he would go to bed at night anxious that <br/>\nhe wasn&#39;t getting an education.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of last year, I wrote up a narrative of all he had learned for the state. I read it to <br/>\nhim so that he could verify ot modify it. By the end, he was grinning ear to ear. He said, <br/>\n&quot;Wow, I really am learning a lot! Could you do this for me each month so that I can have <br/>\nevidence that I really am learning?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was the heart of his concern.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this year, he has chosen to use a math curricula even though I&#39;m convinced he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nneed it (after not liking the one he used last year... he decided that for math, he enjoys <br/>\nfollowing a program but wanted to try something new. We looked at programs together <br/>\nand bought MathUSee because it appealed to him.

If he believes he wants curriculum and is asking for it, I&#39;m not <br/>\ngoing to try very hard to stop you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thought -- get something used, don&#39;t blow a pile of cash on <br/>\nsomething of dubious value that he&#39;s likely to tire of.  Get it cheap <br/>\nenough so that some day you can happily toss it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;m in CA and at the Sacramento bookroom, I can get recycled public <br/>\nschool textbooks for generally less than $10.  And I can get college <br/>\nlevel textbooks at my local library sale for $1 each.  I bought a World <br/>\nHistory text on Saturday for that price.  But I&#39;m not sure why I wanted <br/>\nit.  Maybe I&#39;m storing up textbooks and nuts for the winter. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond thought -- involve him in the selection process.  Have him look <br/>\nthrough some of the curricular materials that your homeschooling friends <br/>\nhave.  I also like The Complete Homelearning Source Book, which reviews <br/>\nlots of &quot;learning materials&quot;, not just curriculum in a box.  I&#39;ve also <br/>\nlived in cities where the public libraries had math textbooks on the <br/>\nshelves.  He can &quot;audition&quot; them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird thought -- debrief him on your prior school at home experiences.  <br/>\nWhat parts of it did he think were &quot;best&quot; and &quot;worst&quot;.  He&#39;s either <br/>\ngoing to revisit some of the unhappy feelinsg now, or when he repeats <br/>\nthose experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal thought -- he mentioned GED prep.  Can you get a GED prep book <br/>\nfrom the library and look at that first? <br/>\n<br/>\nPost-final thought -- just this week someone on one of these lists <br/>\nposted a link to an Alfie Kohn article on what it means to be educated.  <br/>\nYou could make that article into a lesson on philosophy and critical <br/>\nthinking for you son. &lt;g&gt;  (If he&#39;s ready for it.)  It&#39;s fairly <br/>\nthought-provoking stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some empathy for you son, because when I was trying to learn more <br/>\nabout computer programming in my 30s, I would only make progress when I <br/>\nwas signed up for a class.  Somehow I needed that &quot;push&quot; of having a due <br/>\ndate for assigned homework.  I think the reason I needed that was that I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t really sincerely interested in programming, just thought I <br/>\n&quot;should&quot; learn about it and that it would be &quot;good for me&quot; to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nPS     OK, this is an evil idea and you can take it or leave it, but an <br/>\nimp on my shoulder said &quot;Make him pay for it.&quot;   In theory he would.... <br/>\num... appreciate it more.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":182836554,"authorName":"Martha Donnelly","from":"Martha Donnelly &lt;msahyun@...&gt;","profile":"finch422003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Adult Results","postDate":"1097588310","msgId":100604,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMzU5RkEwLTFDNTQtMTFEOS05NDg4LTAwMzA2NTdFNjJGOEBzYmNnbG9iYWwubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJEOTEzRTU4LjJEOTIwJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PEJEOTEzRTU4LjJEOTIwJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":100602,"nextInTopic":100606,"prevInTime":100603,"nextInTime":100605,"topicId":100584,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Can anybody help me out here?

Plus the fact that up until recently you were saying<br/>\n&quot;Trust me, you have to do this or you won&#39;t succeed in life,&quot; but now you&#39;re<br/>\nsaying &quot;Oops, I was wrong. But trust me, now I know you don&#39;t have to do<br/>\nthat to succeed.&quot; It would be natural for him to worry that you&#39;d discover<br/>\nyou were wrong again and he did need to do the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what would help most is if he met other unschoolers so he could see<br/>\nthat following interests works and to counter the messages he&#39;s getting<br/>\nelsewhere. Have you advertised an unschoolers get together? Try the library,<br/>\nnatural food stores, coops and so on. Lots of people have said that when<br/>\nthey put out the call for unschoolers that unschoolers came out of the<br/>\nwoodwork. :-) Even -- or maybe especially -- in heavily Christian areas<br/>\nwhere Bob Jones rules. Unschoolers tend to feel like they&#39;re alone so they<br/>\ngo out of their way to meet other unschoolers when they find others are<br/>\nactually out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it would help if he&#39;d write out all his concerns and post them here so<br/>\npeople could sort of remotely show them their unschooled children and what,<br/>\nespecially the older ones, are doing without curriculum. And he&#39;d hear other<br/>\nadults saying what you&#39;re saying about not needing school work and it might<br/>\nsound more credible to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould he let you read him the Teenage Liberation Handbook?<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I&#39;d make sure he has easy access to exploring his interests. And fun<br/>\neducational stuff like computer programs and online games and things you&#39;ll<br/>\ndo with him, which might be an easier step than going from schoolwork to<br/>\ndoing &quot;whatever&quot;. And then be available to help him set up a schedule but<br/>\nnot enforce it -- like you&#39;re doing now -- to do school work if he wants. If<br/>\nhe feels like you&#39;re a road block in what he wants, even if it&#39;s schoolwork,<br/>\nit will make it harder for him to let go of it since it will feel like<br/>\nyou&#39;re making the decision for him to make him let it go.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180083488,"authorName":"sweetbo3boys","from":"&quot;sweetbo3boys&quot; &lt;sweetbo3boys@...&gt;","profile":"sweetbo3boys","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: My son wants a curriculum.

I wrote a while back with another question, and you were all so <br/>\nhelpful that I thought I would write again. I think I am handling <br/>\nthis OK, but would like some advice if anyone is willing to give it. <br/>\nMy 11 year old keeps asking me to give him a curriculum. He wants to <br/>\ndo school at home. All the subjects, specifically. At first I was <br/>\nasking him what he wants to do, and he said a few specific goals <br/>\nlike cursive writing and math in general. I asked him if he wanted a <br/>\ncursive book, and he decided he just wanted a sheet to show the <br/>\ncursive letters so he could work on them himself, so I gave that to <br/>\nhim. I asked him if he wanted a math book or just to work on math <br/>\ntogether, he wanted a math book. I got some developmental math <br/>\nbooks, Key to... books and miquon, and thought he could see if that <br/>\nwas what he wanted. He liked the books. He did work on the cursive <br/>\nand math one day and then left them alone. It has been about a month <br/>\nsince that happened. I did not bug him about it, or push him to do <br/>\nit. The past couple of days he has been asking me again about doing <br/>\na curriculum. I asked him once again what he wanted to &quot;do&quot;, and he <br/>\nsaid... math, science, reading writing, history, - a realy <br/>\ncurriculum. I remided him of the books I purchased for him and he <br/>\nsaid that was fine , but he wanted everything. He said he wants to <br/>\nbe prepared to take his GED when it was time and that I need to <br/>\nforce him to do his work. He wanted me to go back to a couple of <br/>\nyears ago when I did not know any better and make him do his work. I <br/>\nam sensitive to this because we both ended up in tears when that <br/>\nhappened. I don&#39;t want to go back to that, and I have told him so. I <br/>\nasked him if he would like me to get him a mentor and he can work <br/>\nwith them, and he said no. So, I am working with him, but I told him <br/>\nthat it has to come from him. I can wake him up in the morning and <br/>\nremind him that he wanted to do some work , but I will not struggle <br/>\nwith him to do it. I am going to try and just figure out what he <br/>\nwants to learn, and be there for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a feeling that he is stressed because our homeschooling <br/>\ngroups have mostly kids that school at home, and people ask him all <br/>\nthe time what he is doing. I think maybe he is trying to fit in, or <br/>\nfeels scared that he will not get to go to college or work or <br/>\nanything if he does not go. I am trying to just keep the <br/>\ncommunication going, and give him examples of what he &quot;is&quot; learning <br/>\nall on his own. Life has been really good since we started <br/>\nunschooling. I realize that he is much older now, and a lot more <br/>\nmature, so maybe he could handle &quot;school at home&quot; better, but that <br/>\nis not what I want. We will se what happens, I just thought that if <br/>\nanyone had any advice on workbooks, or things that might get him <br/>\ngoing that I may have not thought of, it would give me some more <br/>\ninsight. I know that he is asking for a reason, and maybe I am just <br/>\nmaking it more difficult than it has to be. People in my <br/>\nhomeschooling group think I am crazy, because my son is begging to <br/>\ndo work and I have such a relaxed attitude towards it, but I truly <br/>\nthink that by forcing him even when he is asking is not the answer. <br/>\nI like a more realistic approach.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIF you have any thought, I appreciate it. Thank you so much for <br/>\nlistening.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela Bohan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100838,"nextTopicId":100840}}
