I can tell you that your interpretation of<br/>\nhomeschooling is wrong !!  I hope that you have a homeschooling support<br/>\ngroup in your area that you can visit and families that you can talk to<br/>\nso that you can see that extremely few homeschoolers are like that.  My<br/>\ndaughter at the age of 6yo. knows plenty of the &quot;world&quot; outside of our<br/>\nhome.  She has a childhood, more than a child who spends 8 hours away<br/>\nfrom their family and stuck in a classroom, behind a desk, with a teacher<br/>\nthat can not give individual attention to each child because she has so<br/>\nmany to teach and she is only one person.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t have a support group in your area, I would love to be your<br/>\nguinea pig- study our family, see for yourself, and learn more of<br/>\nhomeschoolers before painting such a ugly picture of how you interpret<br/>\nwhat homeschoolers are like.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nNatalie Harley<br/>\nFlorida<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Herc22@...\">Herc22@...</a><br/>\nNatalie<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>\nTry Juno Web: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2217,"nextTopicId":2200}}
