Spar&#39;s...A spar is to 10. Two individuals fight. All forms of <br/>\nfighting apply in a spar, all special weapons can be used. No one dies, no <br/>\nrezz is lost in a Spar to 10.<br/>\nNew players and old players spar to see who is superior, and also to advance <br/>\nto higher ranks.  <br/>\n       <br/>\n       2.) DM&#39;s or Death-matches...A DM is to 13. Two individuals can start a <br/>\nDM. All forms of special weapons can be used. Individuals die, and rezz is <br/>\nlost. DM are done to see<br/>\nwhich player is superior over others. They can be fought for many reasons. If <br/>\none player in a room wishes to begin a DM on another. He calls forth {{ AoN <br/>\nDMstrike then the persons name}} then makes his/her first hit. If one is <br/>\nusing a +weapon enhancer the first strike will not be with the +weapon <br/>\nenhancer. After the first round, then the two individuals can activate there <br/>\n+weapon enhancers if they use one. By simply stating ( activating +1 through <br/>\n+5 ) of there own official +weapon enhancer which is listed in there profile. <br/>\nThen and only then after stating the enhancer can it be used for the rest of <br/>\nthe fight. If a player is losing badly he/she may call for assisstance from <br/>\nothers, but only is help is asked for. Then another player can jump into the <br/>\nDM to help out a friend with the fight.<br/>\nThen there will be 2 individuals attacking 1 individual. The individual <br/>\nlending aid to a comrade can use the +weapon enhancer on there enterence into <br/>\nthe DM. But must state within there description (Activating +weapon) , if not <br/>\nthen they can only use there Base dice, until the next round. Even though the <br/>\nDM is still in play with 3 players now fighting it turns into a MPC. But the <br/>\nfight will still only go to 13, as the original fight began as a DM not an <br/>\nMPC. If further aid is requested by another player in the DM, now MPC. <br/>\nAnother player can jump in and pull one of the 2 attacking the 1 out of the <br/>\nMPC. Thus starting another<br/>\nseperate DM, which will go to 13. This leaves the original 2 fighters , and a <br/>\nnew DM with 2 fighters. IF further aid is called for another player can jump <br/>\ninto the first battle making it 3 players and a MPC, as well as the 2 battle <br/>\nmaking it a secound MPC.<br/>\n       Also During the first and secound battles of 3 individuals now. If one <br/>\ndies following the original DM to 13 rule. Still another can jump into that <br/>\nfight, and continue the fight if so warrented. Only then aid does not have to <br/>\nbe asked for...then we get into the area known as MCC or Mass Chaos Combat. <br/>\nWhich can be deadly..and many can die..and the whole room, is in a War, which <br/>\nstarted from the original DM. And all fights still go to 13. All<br/>\nlosers souls go to Hades. for a period of 24 hours. before they can be rezzed <br/>\nby eather there  own god/ goddess or by there own Elders.Gods/goddess&#39;s can <br/>\nrezz there own mortals, but only Elders can rezz gods/goddess&#39;s.<br/>\n       <br/>\n       3.) AA&#39;s or Assasination Attempts...any rank of individual within the <br/>\nforum from Elder God to Soldier can AA anyone they so chose. This is done by, <br/>\nappearing in a room and<br/>\nwithin 5 secounds of arriving one states {{AoN AA the name of the person <br/>\nbeing attacked}} the description short, and the roll. For the initial AA <br/>\nattack one cannot use there +<br/>\nweapon enhancers only there base dice listed in there profiles . Example:  <br/>\nJaran shaitan runs in and slams his dagger into Ravian belle...{{AoN  AA.}} <br/>\nhis base dice as a king is 2d48+3 , so he rolls and gets a 32 40  which is <br/>\nscored as 3+4=7 point hit...now , the the one being AAed  can eather clain <br/>\nCI, which is explained further down or roll there base dice . Ravian belle is <br/>\na goddess she rolls 2d50 without her +4 weapon enhancer . &quot;Ravian tries to<br/>\nblock with an energy shield and  pokes jaran in the eye with her finger&quot;...41 <br/>\n27...here you see she blocked with 4 points of her DR, so the score would <br/>\nbe..7 pts hit-4 pt block = a 3 point hit or score 3-0 Jaran.  After the first <br/>\nroll, the one being AAed has two choses. They can defend and roll with there <br/>\nbase dice no +weapon enhancers, or they can call CI or &quot;Combat inhibitions&quot;. <br/>\nIf CI is stated, then they have to leave the room for 13 minutes. And the AA <br/>\nis over. No one dies, no rezz is lost. If the player attacked takes the AA, <br/>\nand defends. Then the fight reverts to a DM, which will go to 13. Also if the <br/>\nassassin appears and attacks and rolls a doubles of any number, or even a 1  <br/>\n1, then the AA is considerd <br/>\n       &quot;Perfect&quot; , and the one which is attacked dies.  Then the AA is over. <br/>\nThe Assassin can stay, or leave. If the AA goes to a DM, on the 2nd round <br/>\nboth fighters can then<br/>\nactivate there +weapons, and all special attacks can be used. If successful <br/>\nthe loser dies, there soul goes to hades...where they stay for 24 hours then <br/>\nthey can be rezzed by there god/goddess, or there own Elders..gods/goddess&#39;s <br/>\ncan rezz there own mortals, only Elders can rezz Gods/goddess&#39;s.<br/>\n       <br/>\n       4.) MPC&#39;s or Multi-person-combats....an MPC goes to 15. This form of <br/>\ncombat is used mainly if 1 person begins a fight against 2 other individuals. <br/>\nMost of the time that<br/>\nmadness, but it can be enjoyable. The roll of Initials is first done.. <br/>\n//roll-dice1-sides6...and then the three sees who will go first and it is <br/>\nfollowed in order throughout the MPC to 15. Only in an MPC can all 3 players <br/>\nactivate there +weapon enhancers within there description prior to there <br/>\nfirst foll. Then they can use there +weapons for the remainder of the match, <br/>\nto 15. All special attacks can be used in an MPC. Also if assistence is <br/>\ncalled for<br/>\nanother can jump into the MPC and pull one of the fighters off, thus starting <br/>\na DM on the side which will and only then go to 15. For its a spin off of the <br/>\noriginal MPC which goes to 15. Some perfer to be honorable and fight for <br/>\nthemselves. But it is an option to call for assisstance from others. When the <br/>\nloser gets to 15 he simply blocks, and dies...there soul is sent to ha<br/>\ndes..and stays for 24 hours, then there god/goddess, or there Elders can rezz<br/>\nthem. God/goddess can rezz there own mortals, only Elders can rezz gods/ <br/>\ngoddess&#39;s...<br/>\n       <br/>\n       5.) SM&#39;s or Slave-Matches...Anyone from Elder to soldier can SM anyone <br/>\nelse. SM&#39;s go to 13. Slave matches are all for only 1 mun week. Anything can <br/>\nbe done to the loser of<br/>\nthe SM except un-siring of other individuals.<br/>\n       All special attacks can be used. To do a SM its simular to an AA. The <br/>\none starting the SM appears in a room, states {{AoN SM names the person}} <br/>\ndescribes the attack, and<br/>\nrolls. As in an AA, +weapon enhancers are not used just the base dice which <br/>\nis listed in the individuals profile is used first.<br/>\n       No CI can be used. After the initial attack is made the SMed one <br/>\ndescribes his/her defence and roll using just there base dice no +weapon <br/>\nenhancers.<br/>\n       After the first round both combatents then can activate there +weapon <br/>\nenhancer if they use any, but it must be stated in there description. <br/>\n(activating + weapons) then they<br/>\ncan use there +weapons for the remainder of the match. As stated the match <br/>\ngoes to 13. No deaths in a SM, no rezz is lost. SM&#39;s are 1 on 1 no aid can be <br/>\ngiven except a healing by a god/or goddess and it has to be asked for stated <br/>\nin the room...also when one loses a Slave match they have to put in there <br/>\nprofiles {{ SN slave to whoever}} and keep it in there profile till the 1 <br/>\nweek is over, or they are freed by a HM..from someone else..also no slave<br/>\ncan do a DM, MPC, AA, or SM to anyone else unless they have permission by <br/>\nthere master or mistress first..no permission fights will be invalid..no <br/>\nslave can be owned by two masters/mistress&#39;s.<br/>\n       <br/>\n       6.) HM&#39;s or Honor-Matches...HM&#39;s go to 13. They are used to settle <br/>\ndisagreements between two individuals. No one dies, no rezz is lost. All <br/>\nspecial attacks can be used. Also<br/>\nif someone wishes to challenge someone to free a slave from a SM. Then and HM <br/>\ncan be fought. If the challenger wins. The slave is set free. If the <br/>\nchallenger loses the HM. He or She is not enslaved, no death, no rezz <br/>\nlost..anyone from Elder to soldier can do a HM.<br/>\n       Hm&#39;s are 1 to 1 individuals fights, no one can interfear in a HM, no <br/>\nassasstence can be asked for...for it is an Honor Match. No healing can be <br/>\nasked for eather.<br/>\n  <br/>\n       <br/>\n                             ~ Normal Ranks of AoN ~   <br/>\n <br/>\n       All Elder Gods / Elder Goddess&#39;s...(2d60+5) <br/>\n       All elder Gods / elder goddess&#39;s have Eternal Rezz, they still have to <br/>\nwait 24 hours, but they can self rezz themselves...Gods/Goddess (2d50+4) , <br/>\nare rezzed by there own Elders, Gods/Goddess&#39;s can rezz any of there own <br/>\nmortals within there own realm, after the 24 hr time period.<br/>\n  <br/>\n       Gods / Goddess&#39;s (2d50+4) Rezz 10 total. <br/>\n       Kings / Queen&#39;s (2d48+3) Rezz 8 total.<br/>\n       Prince / Princess (2d46+2) Rezz 7 total.<br/>\n       Dukes /Duchess&#39;s (2d44+2) Rezz 5 total.<br/>\n       Viscount&#39;s (2d42+2) Rezz 5 total<br/>\n       Earls (2d40+2) Rezz 5 total<br/>\n       Lords /Lady&#39;s (2d38+2) Rezz 4 total<br/>\n       Count /Countess (2d36+2) Rezz 4 total<br/>\n       Baron /Baroness (2d34+2) Rezz 4 total<br/>\n       Marshal (2d32+2) Rezz 3 total<br/>\n       Knights (2d30) Rezz 3 total<br/>\n       Squires (2d28) Rezz 3 total<br/>\n       Veterans (2d26) Rezz 2 total<br/>\n       Soldier (2d24) Rezz 2 total<br/>\n       Peasant (2d22) Rezz 1 total<br/>\n <br/>\n       <br/>\n       Special Attacks:<br/>\n       <br/>\n       1.) (KO&#39;s) or Knock-outs...during any of the six combat forms of <br/>\nfighting within AoN, one can use (KO&#39;s). This is simply done when describing <br/>\nyour defense and attack at the<br/>\nend of said description you place a (KO1). Then you roll your dice. If <br/>\ndoubled come up, any type of doubles even a 1 1, you have knocked out your <br/>\nopponent. And they will be out-cold for 1 round. Meaning you  roll again, and <br/>\nyour oppenent takes more damage because they have been knocked-out. If <br/>\ndoubles are not rolled the fight continues as normal. One can use 3 (KO&#39;s) in <br/>\na match. make sure you keep track of the number you have used.(you must put a<br/>\n(KO1, KO2, or KO3) within your description or the doubles will not be counted <br/>\nas a knockout. no exceptions.<br/>\n       <br/>\n       2.) *TA* or Total Attack...*TA* can be used once in any type of match. <br/>\nSince it is a total attack there is no defense in your roll. Example: 34 23. <br/>\nnormally the 34 would be<br/>\nyour DR, and the 23 would be your AR. Except by using a *TA* you simply add <br/>\nthe first #&#39;s of each roll togeather or (3+2=5 or a 5 point hit.) If your <br/>\nroll is higher the same thing applies. It can be a deadly special attack..if <br/>\nused at the right time.And it must be mentioned in your discription before <br/>\nyour roll as *TA* for it to work.<br/>\n       <br/>\n       3.) *TD* or Total defense...can be used once within any match. Ruffly <br/>\nthe same as a *TA*, but the reverse of it. As well it must be stated within <br/>\nyour description *TD* for<br/>\nit to work before you roll. Example: You roll a 45 18.<br/>\n       Now usually your DR would be 45 and your AR would be 18. Except you <br/>\nalready stated it to be a *TD*. so its a total defensive move. You simply add <br/>\nthe first #&#39;s of each roll togeather or (4+1=5 or a 5 point defense roll.) If <br/>\nyou roll higher your defense will be greater. *TD* can be used to block a <br/>\n*US* if it has not be used yet in a match. And only if the *TD* is higher <br/>\nthan the *US* used. Its also used against a *TA* or total attack.<br/>\n       <br/>\n       4.) *US* or Ultimate Sacrifice...something to use if your about to <br/>\ndie, and you have used all of your other special attacks and defenses.... So, <br/>\nyou discribe your last bit<br/>\nof energy list *US*, and roll. Except since its a total last attack there is <br/>\nno defense to your *US*. <br/>\n       and instead of using 2d you use 1d. Example: AdephNull:: he&#39;s almost <br/>\ndead but he has one last card to play and with the last of his strength he <br/>\nhits his enemy with a blast of energy *US* and then falls to his knees <br/>\ndazed:: (he would then roll //roll-dice1-sides120...because his normal dice <br/>\nof 2d60 is doubled and since its a complete last attack only 1dice is use) <br/>\nand it comes up AdephNull rolls 99...meaning he just hit his enemy with a 9 <br/>\npoint<br/>\nhit. Which could kill the enemy. If the enemies own score is high. But if the <br/>\nroll came up  less he would be out for 1 round...and would probably die. *US* <br/>\nmove is always the last<br/>\nthing one tries if there almost dead..<br/>\n       <br/>\n       5.) healing...during a DM, MPC, SM, <br/>\nElders, gods/godess&#39;s can step into a fight as long as there are not more <br/>\nthan 3 people already fighting and &quot;Heal&quot; someone. And it has to be asked for <br/>\nin the room not in im&#39;s. This is done by the person discribing the act of <br/>\nhealing with energy of some kind then the roll. Example: 34 42. The AR is 42 <br/>\nor a 4 point<br/>\nheal. Now the one accepting the healing to lower his score has to simply <br/>\nblock his enemy and state he is &quot;accepting healing&quot; and uses only 1dice...or <br/>\n::TekLordMoi sends healing power into AdephNull:: 22 50. the AR is 50 so its <br/>\na 5 point heal. ::AdephNull kneels and accepts the healing only blocking his <br/>\nenemy:: 1d65 and he gets a 44. Thus he blocks his enemy and accepts the 5 <br/>\npoints of healing from TekLordMoi. Which drops his score by those 5 points<br/>\nof healing. Then the match continues..<br/>\n       <br/>\n       6.) Max-0ut...or Max-out of AR. If any individual maxes out his or her <br/>\nAR example:: ShaitisX rolls as a god 2d54 and his roll comes up as <br/>\n       38 54...that is considered at Max-out on his AR...which he would <br/>\nautomatically get a 5 point hit. The first # of the AR roll is the number of <br/>\nthe max-out. Enhancers included. nothing can block a maxout, not even a <br/>\n*TD*...so no need to waste it..<br/>\n     <br/>\n      7.) Regular block...can be used as a defense against *TA* but only one <br/>\ntime during a match, or against a *US* if it has not been used yet. Its <br/>\nrolled as example:: <br/>\n//roll-dice1-sides65...meaning its all DR defense no AR attack...example:: <br/>\nPertinaxx blasts baronLocke with a surge of proton energy which rips through <br/>\nhis armor and sizzles the elder as he falls backwards :: roll comes up 60 <br/>\n64....::Baronlocke having used all his special attacks and defenses already <br/>\ngoes for the old simply block with a energy shield which surrounds him and <br/>\nwards off that powerful energy blast:: he rolls<br/>\n     1d65 for he is an elder and his +weapon is included in the block, it <br/>\ncomes up a 65 DR...which block pertinaxx&#39;s AR of 64..so the score would be <br/>\nthe same, and the match would continue. Thats the use of the 1d roll..for <br/>\ndefense.<br/>\n     <br/>\n  <br/>\n       Normal combat:<br/>\n       <br/>\n       For the new players and the old players a refresher on this. I&#39;ll make <br/>\nit simple.<br/>\n       Your first roll is called the DR or Defense roll, the 2nd roll is <br/>\ncalled your AR or your Attack roll..Example:: 45 50...DR is 45, AR is 50. To <br/>\nscore points one always scores from the AR to your opponents DR.<br/>\n       Now an example of a few rounds of simple combat:<br/>\n       BaronLocke:: he swings his sword and chops through pertinaxx&#39;s left <br/>\narm severing it and blood splashes the crowd:: 43 50....(his DR is 43 his AR <br/>\nis 50)<br/>\n       Pertinaxx:: steps into the chop shorting the distance and paries his <br/>\nsword with his own sword, knocking it to the left, then a secret blade shoots <br/>\nout from the pommel of his own sword, and hit baronlocke in the neck <br/>\nimpailing him and blood splashes the crowd:: 51 38. (here we see that <br/>\npertinaxx defended baronLockes AR of 50 with his own DR of 51, and pertinaxx <br/>\nalso attacked with a 38 AR, which the Baron will have to block on his next <br/>\nroll.) so<br/>\nthe score ( 0-baronlocke 0-pertinaxx or simply 0-0)<br/>\n       BaronLocke:: He raises an energy shield and Pertinaxx&#39;s secret blade <br/>\nbounces off and does him no damage, then he spins and thrusts his sword into <br/>\nPertinaxx&#39;s chest ripping it out the left side (KO1)::<br/>\n       36 43...(here we see the barons DR is 36 but he had to block <br/>\npertinaxx&#39;s AR of 38 which he doesn&#39;t so 38-36=2 so a 1 point hit is made. <br/>\nAnd Pertinaxx&#39;s has to defend baronlockes AR of 43 on his next roll, Also you <br/>\nnoticed the Baron went for a (KO1) which he tried to get doubles. If he had <br/>\nsucceeded Pertinaxx would have been knocked out for 1 round, and the baron <br/>\nwould have gone again. Thus pertinaxx would have gotten more damage. But the <br/>\nscore<br/>\nis now 1-0 P.)<br/>\n       Thats simple combat.<br/>\n  <br/>\n      <br/>\n       Note: +4 weapon enhancer given to any RD&#39;s is for killing a God, God<br/>\ndess, or Elder God.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Alliance of Nations","postDate":"1017506059","msgId":33927,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ3LjE1NDBmZmZhLjI5ZDc0MzBiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33931,"prevInTime":33926,"nextInTime":33928,"topicId":33927,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/30/02 8:50:10 AM, serrtana@aol.com writes:  I ll ask the boys when they re up.
