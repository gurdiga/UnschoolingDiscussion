He is a &quot;wild child&quot;.  He is<br/>\nintense and problematic and wonderful and funny.  Much more &quot;pressure per<br/>\nsquare inch&quot; than any of my other 4 children or any of the 14 foster kids we<br/>\nhad.&gt;&gt;  ...He has great difficulty regulating<br/>\nhimself.  He often hurts himself or others because he is either angry or too<br/>\nwound up.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Point being....we unschool Danny the exact same way we do the other<br/>\nchildren....we PARENT Danny differently.  Danny has special issues that when<br/>\nleft to his own devices (not taking a nap and getting tired) he interferes<br/>\nwith other family member&#39;s rights to their lives (he gets too wound up,<br/>\nangry and hits the 2yo)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean that unschooling doesn&#39;t work.  It means that everyone is<br/>\nan individual, even within a diagnostic category.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have very similar issues in our home.  All three of our kids were cocaine / alcohol exposed in the womb.  None have full blown FAS, but all deal with different aspects of FAE, PTSD, etc. .<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s amazing is that Unschooling is the ONLY thing that did work for all three (really two, because my youngest is 3, and would be living the same life he is now, even if his siblings were in school).  Between Unschooling and swithching our parenting mode from rewards/consequences to what is described in The Explosive Child, we have seen dramatic improvements all the way around.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only are the kids happier, but we are as parents too.  Just a greater sense of well-being, harmony in the family.  There is a feeling of respecting everyone - value for what each person needs, feels.  For my children this was key, because so much happened TO them which they had no say in.  We are still striving to move more and more in these directions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur children&#39;s special issues have led us to choose to limit t.v. / video games / exposure to violence - sexual stuff.  I am reading emails about &quot;t.v. viewing&quot; with an open mind, and I do keep an open debate in my head about &quot;should we or shouldn&#39;t we?&quot;, but in the past, excessive Nintendo led to violent, destructive tantrums directly following the play session, e.g. throwing controller and smashing it when frustrated by the game, and hurting people after playing ( and we only had &quot;E&quot; games like Mariocarts and Banjo Kazooie ).  We saw the same pattern with movies or cartoons with violence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey do have unlimited access to Discovery Channel-type shows, PBS, videos from the library, etc. .  Our life has been much more peaceful since we made these adjustments, and it has been a positive change for the kids.  After about a year and a half they don&#39;t even ask to play.  I guess I haven&#39;t been tempted to try unlimited access because when my son plays nintendo at his friends&#39; homes, sure enough he comes home and explodes.  It is literally like clockwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we have had to make modifications to total freedom, but it works for the family, as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nShelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36084,"nextTopicId":35772}}
