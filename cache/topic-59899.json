The two really can&#39;t be separated for unschooling to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I agree, in terms of method, school is school, not unschooling.  And there are definitely subtle (and not so subtle) messages given to the students on a daily basis that wholly contradict what unschooling is all about.  Because of that, the two are diametrically opposed to each other, even if we choose to be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: moonlitbatiks &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moonlitbatiks@...\">moonlitbatiks@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, March 01, 2003 11:28 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Unschooling: the label<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My 5 yo daughter is in kindergarten (at her request) 14 hours/week.<br/>\n  A few weeks ago I would have been offended if someone told me I <br/>\n  wasn&#39;t unschooling, because I felt that it really was her decision, <br/>\n  and she was empowered by that.

If I spend a whole pregnancy<br/>\nread about homebirth and talking to women about homebirth, but when<br/>\nlabor starts, I decide that I should go straight to the hospital, am I a<br/>\nhomebirther?  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat if the topic was breastfeeding?  What if I wanted to consider<br/>\nmyself an extended nurser because I&#39;ve read about how children in other<br/>\ncountries breastfeed until they&#39;re seven?  What if I nursed for a few<br/>\nweeks and the baby didn&#39;t really seem into it, but he took to a bottle<br/>\nright away?  Since he &quot;chose&quot; bottlefeeding even though I support<br/>\nbreastfeeding, can I still be an extended nurser?  (I do realize that<br/>\nit&#39;s not an entirely fair example for older kids.  I think of a 5 yr old<br/>\nchoosing school as an uninformed choice - they might have just seen it<br/>\non Sesame Street or Blues Clues and it looked like fun.  With a 15 yr<br/>\nold, it&#39;s more of a choice)<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t think you can homebirth in a hospital, I don&#39;t think you can<br/>\nextended nurse with a bottle of Similac, and I don&#39;t think you can<br/>\nunschool while sitting in your assigned seat in your third-period World<br/>\nHistory class, listening to someone drone on about King-someone-or-other<br/>\nwhile you&#39;re still thinking about the poem you were trying to write last<br/>\nperiod.  I learned far more outside of school than I ever did in school,<br/>\nbut I wasn&#39;t unschooled.  My dad&#39;s an artist and I tagged along to<br/>\nmuseums, art shows, Art Association meetings, films about Van Gogh.  I<br/>\nalso had a set of Childcraft encyclopedias that I would read over and<br/>\nover in my bedroom.  I explored the woods outside my home, and followed<br/>\nmy grandfather around when he was gardening.  When I went to school, my<br/>\ndad told me that to succeed in school, all I had to do was follow the<br/>\ninstructions and give the teacher the answer s/he wanted.  He told me it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t matter if what they were saying was complete nonsense, just<br/>\nparrot it back as closely as you can for the test and don&#39;t let it<br/>\ninterfere with your life.  I became very good at school, even though I<br/>\nwas learning far more in my out-of-school life.

She isn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; finding it hard. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is an interesting thread.  I&#39;m thinking of my own school experience, and <br/>\nthe type of learner I was then and still am.  I flourished in a school <br/>\nenvironment -- loved the challenge of shooting for grades (even in math, <br/>\nwhich I loathed), enjoyed the personal challenge of testing well, and did a <br/>\nlot of self-motivated integration of materials.  It was a game.  I liked <br/>\njumping through the hoops, and I did it well.  I look back on it now and see <br/>\nthat I really was a self-directed learner, even within a classroom setting.  <br/>\nI remember finding baroque music to listen to while I read history from that <br/>\nperiod...specifically looking for historical fiction from those periods to <br/>\nenrich the textbook experience...really getting into debate with my teachers <br/>\nabout alternative views of several different subjects...rocking the boat, in <br/>\nother words.  Not all of the teachers liked this, but some did, and I didn&#39;t <br/>\nmuch care anyway.  I was having a good time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had had the opportunity and the support, I would have been a candidate <br/>\nfor unschooling, but as it was, I made the best of a limited situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been several other excellent points made in this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But, again, it&#39;s the motivations, not the actions that define unschooling.<br/>\nIf a child is certain they need a teacher to learn something, then they<br/>\naren&#39;t making that decision based on unschooling principles but on fear<br/>\ninstilled by society.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this point is dead on.  My own schooling experience was positive IN <br/>\nSPITE OF the institutional setting because I have somehow always been a <br/>\nself-directed learner.  My dad gave that gift to me (bless him, since he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t give me much else.)  I was relatively free of the socially proscribed <br/>\nsense that I had to do it THEIR way -- except, as I said, in math.  For me, <br/>\nthe teachers were as useful as their ability to get out of the way and let me <br/>\ngo with the material.  They were there to bounce ideas off of, the good ones. <br/>\n It was a partnership.  That&#39;s what I hope to do for my son as we unschool <br/>\nnow.  Get out of his way and let his own internal magic happen.  Obviously, <br/>\nit&#39;s much more efficient to do this at home than in school, especially these <br/>\ndays, what with all the extra stuff they have to *teach.*<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;How can a person by definition be unschooling in school? That is ludicrous <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to <br/>\nme.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nUnschooling is not only an attitude and philosophy, it also mean NOT <br/>\nschooling, at school, or at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to agree with these statements.  While I may have been, by and large, <br/>\na self-directed learner in school, I was never completely free of societal <br/>\nand institutional restraints and expectations, despite my rebellious nature.  <br/>\nNot all of my teacher/student relationships were positive -- not by a long <br/>\nshot.  I may have been self-directed, mainly, but I was in no way an <br/>\nunschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I think the *process* of discussing whether someone can unschool at school<br/>\n </span></blockquote>can be illuminating. Exploring the borders of an idea can help us better<br/>\nunderstand its core because it gives us the opportunity to look at things<br/>\nfrom a very different point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think pinning down and labeling something at the fringe is just<br/>\nconfusing because the *action* isn&#39;t unschooling and labeling that action as<br/>\nunschooling doesn&#39;t clarify the definition of unschooling for anyone. It<br/>\njust muddies it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRight on.  The label, unschooling, just doesn&#39;t fit in this scenario, no <br/>\nmatter how much we might want it to.  Again, as Ren said, though, there is a <br/>\nbig difference between *going to school* and taking classes that interest the <br/>\nchild and which are initiated by that child.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;There&#39;s a book by Grace Llewellyn and Amy Silver called Guerilla<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Learning: How to Give Your Kids a Real Education With or Without School.<br/>\nI&#39;d recommend it to any unschooler whose child is thinking of going to<br/>\nschool or is already there.  On page 33, they say, &quot;While we are not<br/>\ngenerally in favor of war, we liked the &#39;guerrilla&#39; image of a nimble,<br/>\nzealous, loosely organized group of kids educating themselves &#39;beneath<br/>\nthe radar&#39; of the dominant school paradigm.  The power of guerrilla<br/>\nforce lies in their passion and flexibility.  Dedication to a shared<br/>\nvision of freedom allows guerrillas to resist much bigger,<br/>\nbetter-funded, and better-organized forces.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorcha&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI laughed when I read this because it so closely defined my own school <br/>\nexperience (25+ years ago!)  I&#39;ve read Llewellyn&#39;s TLH, but not this one.  If <br/>\nwe need a label for *unschooling at school,* why not adapt her phrase?  <br/>\nGuerilla schooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking that if my son decided to go back to school, I would respect his <br/>\ndecision, once I felt he had thought it through.  But I would hope that he <br/>\nwould go in with a sense of internal rebellion and independence.  I could see <br/>\nhim being quite good guerilla -- now.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nLaura B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59969,"nextTopicId":59938}}
