There&#39;s a <br/>\npuppet theater there that my kids love to play in and I&#39;ve watched the <br/>\ndaycare kids look wistfully at it. The teachers seem in bad moods most of the <br/>\ntime and I&#39;ve listened as they tell kids that they can&#39;t pick a book this <br/>\nweek because they forgot to bring in last week&#39;s book, or to get away from <br/>\nthe puppet theater, or to quit talking and hurry up. My ds is 5 and all of <br/>\nhis friends go to school and I wonder what he thinks when he watches the kids <br/>\nleave in a straight line and look back at us as we play.<br/>\nAmy Kagey<br/>\nChristmas gifts:<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=Z0939&gid=462366&quot;\">http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=Z0939&gid=462366&quot;</a>&gt;free shipping on Usborne Books!&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\nand<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/amycats2/myhomepage/business.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/amycats2/myhomepage/business.html&quot;</a>&gt;Santa Letters for Your Child!&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52014,"nextTopicId":51802}}
