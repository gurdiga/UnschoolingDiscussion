Some districts are very willing to accept the minimum requirements by state while others are constantly harassing homeschoolers who are not strictly curriculum based and very structured.  There are alternative methods i know of in our area where some students are enrolled in very p/t Sudbury style school and thus don&#39;t have to file paperwork.  I know a few families who use a Maryland based company to file all paperwork for them and when school districts make issues they are directed to the Md company who handles all correspondence with schools protecting you from direct harassment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe PASS test was minimally intrusive (at home and leisurely) - however, from my pov it was a drag and i would have much rather not have had to do it...we tried to approach it as a &quot;learning&quot; experience but it became more stressful than not.   Fortunately we don&#39;t have to deal with it again for two more years.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for unschoolers in NY - some exist within larger homeschooler groups.  So just because a group is not called &quot;unschoolers&quot; don&#39;t assume you won&#39;t bump into those that follow a similar path as your own.   Bottom line - every family does it differently from every other family and we&#39;ve never felt excluded or alienated amongst other homeschoolers in our area because of our &quot;style.&quot;  It&#39;s always a treat when the more structured homeschoolers (usually newbies) find there way into relaxing a bit as a result of witnessing the unschoolers amongst us.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa H.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] NY homeschoolers","postDate":"1077984242","msgId":91526,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyZC4zYmMxMGUwNC4yZDcyMTVmMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":91521,"nextInTopic":91535,"prevInTime":91525,"nextInTime":91527,"topicId":91515,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/27/04 6:32:24 PM, ivorygrace7@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1789047709\">In a message dated 2/27/04 6:32:24 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ivorygrace7@...\">ivorygrace7@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; The biggest problem is that <br/>\ncurrently NY requires testing in grades 5, 7, 9, and 10.
