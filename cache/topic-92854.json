I am still <br/>\nlaughing about the foam penis comment.  I do have a question that has been <br/>\nsifting around in my head for the past few days and I thought asking here <br/>\nmay provide some good advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have really relaxed with the whole &quot;violent&quot; toys thing.  The deal is that <br/>\nmy sister and another friend of mine are really against their sons playing <br/>\nany sort of violent play.  Our sons are all almost five years old.  I can <br/>\nunderstand that when we go to their house that we should respect their <br/>\nmother&#39;s wishes; however, when they come to my house their children are <br/>\nstill very closely monitored.  For example, my friend&#39;s son was playing with <br/>\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and he was making them punch each other.  The <br/>\nmother was just so uncomfortable with this that she told her son to go find <br/>\nanother set of toys to play with (Star Wars was acceptable...???).<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my sister, our boys like to wrestle.  She watches over them and then is <br/>\nconstantly telling her son, &quot;Now if you want him to stop, you tell him!&quot;  <br/>\nThat kind of thing.  Pretty soon her son is just watching for her reaction <br/>\nand telling my son to &quot;stop&quot; even though I am 99% sure he wouldn&#39;t be if she <br/>\nweren&#39;t hawking over him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this just makes me feel uncomfortable.  What do I tell my children to do <br/>\nwhen normally that type of play is accepted in our house?  It is our house, <br/>\nbut at the same time when I invite my vegetarian friends over I am not going <br/>\nto serve meat, either.  The last time I simply told my son that &quot;that type <br/>\nof play makes (my sister) feel uncomfortable&quot; in front of her, and that they <br/>\njust couldn&#39;t  wrestle/sword fight/etc.  Should I put away all of the <br/>\n&quot;violent&quot; toys?  It just seems so fake and forced - it is our house and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel that I should have to change its contents to please other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, with my friends who do not monitor everything their children <br/>\ndo, nobody ever seems to get hurt and they all get along fine.  I have also <br/>\nnoticed that my son seems to get upset after play with these two particular <br/>\nfamilies and ends up acting out - which probably reinforces my <br/>\nsister/friend&#39;s concept that me letting my kid&#39;s play with these toys makes <br/>\nthem act violent.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nErika  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar ï¿½ get it now! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://toolbar.msn.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/\">http://toolbar.msn.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92845,"nextTopicId":92830}}
