I will have two minor children with me, but dh","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-552946245\">I will be traveling to Mexico this fall and staying in San Felipe for <br/>\none month.  We will drive from San Diego.  I will have two minor <br/>\nchildren with me, but dh will not be joining us until later.  My <br/>\nquestion:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat identification do I need?  I have phoned two travel agencies.  <br/>\nOne told me that we only need certified birth certificates.  The <br/>\nother said that I need a notorized letter from dh saying that I have <br/>\npermission to take the children out of the country.  My bil says that <br/>\nwe should all have passports, just to be on the safe side.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice would be appreciated!<br/>\nThank you<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nPS Anyone on this list in San Felipe or San Diego?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22977,"nextTopicId":22980}}
