I hesitated for a minute and then<br/>\nexplained to her that the movie included a lot of bloody scenes (she&#39;s been<br/>\nsensitive to this in the past).  I described a few of the scenes for her<br/>\n(heads and limbs getting sliced off) and also told her about the cool fight<br/>\nscenes.  Sarah is very interested in martial arts and sword fighting, so I<br/>\nknew there were parts of the movie she would enjoy.  She decided she&#39;d like<br/>\nto see the sword fights, so we sat down and watched the movie together.

I understand a lot of what you are saying about how a child will desire to see something when told he/she &quot;can&#39;t&quot;, and the sneakiness that can develop from it.  At the same time, it seems that as a parent I am supposed to protect (for lack of a better word at the moment) my child&#39;s emotions, etc.  Not hide, shelter, keep them ignorant of things, but not put images and situations in his/her head that I know disturb him/her just for the sake of being able to watch one particular movie.  It would seem like a lot of responsibility placed on a child - almost like one would be saying &quot;Well... you did choose it yourself...&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat DO you do then?  When your son or daughter asks to see something he/she has heard of and you know there are parts that he/she will be upset at seeing, what do you do?
