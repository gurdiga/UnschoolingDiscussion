Its not really a switch from what we were doing with Beth<br/>\nsince she has never been to school. I am lucky enough to get to stay<br/>\nhome while my husband works. Im going to write a small bit about each<br/>\nof us so you can get to know us. We dont really know many people who<br/>\neither homeschool or unschool.

I have recently found something<br/>\nthat I am very interested in. Its photography. Ive never really had<br/>\nanything that I have been passionate about until now. Here are a few<br/>\nlinks to some of the pictures I have taken recently. I think I am<br/>\ngetting better at it but its just trial and error. I cook and clean and<br/>\nplay. Thats about it and thats just fine by me. I dont really have<br/>\nany friends around me but thankfully I have the internet and I still get<br/>\nto talk to my best friends from childhood online. I dont go out much<br/>\n(other then the once a week volunteer for a day care in a gym in Topeka)<br/>\nbut I am more of a homebody anyway. I enjoy music and just being silly.<br/>\nAnyway here are some photo links (they were all taken in our yard)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/May%2024%20Storm/\">http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/May%2024%20Storm/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/sunset/\">http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/sunset/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/sun2.jpg\">http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/sun2.jpg</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/backend.jpg\">http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/backend.jpg</a><br/>\n <br/>\nJoe (aka Hubby)<br/>\n            Hes a soon to be 32 year old computer and gaming guy. He is<br/>\nthe IT Director for a mental health place in Topeka. He loves gaming and<br/>\nhas been playing RPGs for years. He even wrote a book for the Lord of<br/>\nthe Rings role playing game (Maps of Middle-Earth: Cities and<br/>\nStrongholds). He was really pleased with them because he drew up the<br/>\nmaps and the guy who drew the maps for the movies copied them for the<br/>\nbook. Hes a great guy and is really smart. The kids learn so much from<br/>\nhim. He is very patient and loving and its awesome. <br/>\nHere is his picture<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/joehair/alldone.jpg\">http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/joehair/alldone.jpg</a><br/>\n <br/>\nBeth (aka BethieLou)<br/>\n            Shes really excited about finally turning 7. She just<br/>\nlearned how to ride a normal sized kids bike and she rides all over the<br/>\nyard. She loves butterflies, bugs, flowers, playing with magnets,<br/>\ndrawing and just being a great kid. We had started her on a curriculum a<br/>\nwhile back but once we found unschooling we all decided that it was<br/>\nbetter. I recently got to throw away all the papers that came with the<br/>\ncurriculum and it made me very happy. She loves to read. She will read<br/>\nall the time. Its cool because she will also read to her brothers and<br/>\nthey just love that. <br/>\nHere is her picture<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/bethface.jpg\">http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/bethface.jpg</a><br/>\n <br/>\nJerome (aka Romy)      <br/>\n            Hes 4 ½ and just an awesome kid. He has some anger trouble<br/>\nbut we have been talking about it and he is really smart and he is<br/>\nfinally starting to understand how to control his anger instead of just<br/>\nletting it fly off the handle at his brother or sister. He also just<br/>\nlearned to ride a bike this weekend. He is so happy with himself (and we<br/>\nare so proud too!) that he rides around the driveway like there is no<br/>\ntomorrow. He just learned today how to get the bike going by himself<br/>\nwithout a push from mom or dad. The smile on his face was priceless.<br/>\nHes a big lover of all things mechanical. He loves puzzles and can<br/>\npretty much look at a puzzle once (not huge ones but kid sized ones) and<br/>\nput it back together with little trouble. Hes a big hugger and kisser<br/>\nand I love that a lot. <br/>\nHere is his picture<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/romy/romyjingy3.jpg\">http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/romy/romyjingy3.jpg</a><br/>\n <br/>\nEdward (aka Eddie Spaghetti)<br/>\n            Hes 3 and just crazy as the day is long. We will spend<br/>\nhours just being silly and rolling around in the grass. He loves bugs<br/>\nand is the only person in the house brave enough (except for Daddy) to<br/>\ntake the june bugs back outside when they sneak in. His favorite thing<br/>\nis to ride on the Harley power wheels motorcycle around the yard. Hes<br/>\ntrying to learn how to ride a bike because he wants to be like everyone<br/>\nelse. He has scraped knees but he still keeps trying. He is also a big<br/>\nlover guy and will sit on my lap and cuddle for hours. He likes cars and<br/>\nninjas. Hes a big Ninja Turtle fan as well. <br/>\nHere is his picture<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/eddihandsome.jpg\">http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/eddihandsome.jpg</a><br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, thats probably a pretty long introduction and I apologize but I<br/>\njust wanted to become acquainted with the group and start contributing<br/>\nwhen I can. I figure if you know more about us then it will be easier<br/>\nfor you to help me out with suggestions and such. I am still new to all<br/>\nof this and have changed a whole lot since I started this unschooling<br/>\njourney. We are working on being more mindful parents and helping our<br/>\nkids find what they need and not telling them what they need. Its<br/>\nworking well so far. The kids are happy and I am happy. My house may not<br/>\nalways been clean and my laundry will never been done but we are living<br/>\nand happy and to me thats all that really matters. <br/>\nThanks for putting up with my long windedness.

They just started tonight, <br/>\nand found 2 bugs we could not identify. She drew a picture of one <br/>\nthat was so good and helped her Daddy to take pictures of them latter <br/>\nfor a bug book we hope to make for her. This is in no way something <br/>\nwe are forcing her to do, or even asking her to do. We just got a kid <br/>\nbug kit we thought she would like, and she adores it! <br/>\n<br/>\n I was wondering if others have done this and if they have any good <br/>\nsights to help us figure out what kinds of bugs she catches! <br/>\n<br/>\n   Any help would be great! <br/>\n<br/>\n   Blessings,<br/>\n   Kimmy<br/>\n <br/>\nA note to newbies, after you get over the programmed shock of <br/>\nunschooling, it becomes natural to just flow with it. I learned this <br/>\nthe hard way. I was fighting it in myself, not feeling the truth of <br/>\nhow natural it is. I wish no one had to go through that. I am not <br/>\nthinking about how much my child might be learning through her bug <br/>\nlove and hunting, I just know she is.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96545052,"authorName":"marji","from":"marji &lt;marji@...&gt;","profile":"gaia10921","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Insect Web Sites please?","postDate":"1086047680","msgId":94942,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMC4zLjAuMC4yMDA0MDUzMTE5NTE1OC4wMjdiYjFhMEBtYWlsLmdhaWF3b2xmLm9yZz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGM5aDVocCtodjAyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGM5aDVocCtodjAyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":94941,"nextInTopic":94945,"prevInTime":94941,"nextInTime":94943,"topicId":94941,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This might be a good starting place: http://www.enature.com/guides/select_group.asp You might get close and then have to google around a bit to tweak your ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-677281124\">This might be a good starting place:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.enature.com/guides/select_group.asp\">http://www.enature.com/guides/select_group.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou might get close and then have to google around a bit to tweak your <br/>\nresults.
