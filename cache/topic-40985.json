So today we went to check it out. He was VERY dissapointed that he<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t get to ride today, but seemed to be even more excited about the<br/>\nidea of riding and learning how to care for a horse. I&#39;m going to have to do<br/>\nsome juggling with money and with Shannon, who at 15 months is simply to<br/>\nyoung to do any riding and too old to be willing to sit in a stroller and<br/>\nwatch, but he will get his lessons!! If he decides after only one or two<br/>\ntimes that it&#39;s not for him then I feel it is more than worth the effort of<br/>\ngetting him there because his horizons have already been expanded to see and<br/>\nexperience something completely different. I dont&#39; consider us<br/>\npre-unschoolers--we are unschooling from the get go---Shawn has asked a few<br/>\ntimes this week to work on his workbook...HIS idea. He probably spent an<br/>\nhour 2x this week doing numbers and letters and started on drawing lines to<br/>\nget him ready to actually write the letters. When he was tired of it he told<br/>\nme and we stopped. When I&#39;m tired of something I stop....why is our society<br/>\nso bent on preparing children for a life of hardship and no choices????  In<br/>\nREAL life we as adults only do what we WANT to anyway. If we know what the<br/>\nconsequences are to not paying our taxes then we either CHOSE to pay or<br/>\nnot---This is life. Why make our children think that life is nothing but<br/>\nforced work that has no relation to our life?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMY neighbor told me her 6 yr old had 14 pages of work today, on the 2nd day<br/>\nof school. My question was if he enjoyed it. She said evidently....but<br/>\nwhy??? Why would a very active little boy enjoy sitting and working on<br/>\npaper? and then get home to have mom tell him his m&#39;s were sloppy and needed<br/>\nto practice those and vocabulary for another hour....I simply don&#39; t get<br/>\nit:(\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBeth-Shawn and Shannon&#39;s mommy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40996,"nextTopicId":40902}}
