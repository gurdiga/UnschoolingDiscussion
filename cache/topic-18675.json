Some of the things we were <br/>\ntaught in school (the adult-mom-homeschoolers who went ten or twenty or <br/>\nthirty years ago) is no longer true, whether politically or scientifically or <br/>\nwhether the tradition has just changed (as in cases of grammar, punctuation, <br/>\netiquette, typing).  A platypus is a mammal.  A panda is a bear again (used <br/>\nto be; wasn&#39;t; is).  The order of planets isn&#39;t as simple as I learned from <br/>\nmy cousin, in third grade, in a little chant about &quot;the planets that live <br/>\nnear the stars.&quot;  Columbus did NOT &quot;know exactly what to do,&quot; it&#39;s in there <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s ressuring and simple and it rhymes.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI was defending inquiry and change.
