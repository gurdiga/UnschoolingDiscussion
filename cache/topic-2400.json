I feel very similar to you regarding<br/>\nWaldorf Schools and Homeschooling, although I didn&#39;t have the time or<br/>\npatience to research and study as much as you.  My understanding was tha<br/>\nSteiner had created the Kindergarten to resemble a home-like environment for<br/>\nthe workers&#39; children who couldn&#39;t be at home but that a real home<br/>\nenvironment was preferable.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren and Nancy--regarding people having kids that intend to put them into<br/>\ndaycare/school all day, etc.--<br/>\n<br/>\nI too am astounded at this attitude about children.  I live in a pretty<br/>\naffluent &quot;yuppy&quot; area and see this a lot.  I actually have a friend at<br/>\nchurch with 2 children the ages of mine (6 and 2) who is a Social Worker by<br/>\nprofession.  HSe told me after the youngest was born that she finally found<br/>\na good childcare center for him and her daughter was starting Kind. that<br/>\nyear so she was going back to work fulltime.  She changed jobs and was no<br/>\nlonger in direct social work, instead she would be doing more administrative<br/>\ntype stuff. She then said, &quot;I&#39;ll still have my Stephen Ministry work at<br/>\nchurch to fulfill my nurturing needs.&quot;  I wanted to say, &quot;why don&#39;t you<br/>\nnurture your kids intead?????&quot; but bit my tongue (guess I&#39;m not that<br/>\noutspoken old lady yet!)  Often she brings her girl to children&#39;s choir in<br/>\nthe afternoons at church and doesn&#39;t have the 2 year old with her---she<br/>\nleaves him at daycare so she doesn&#39;t &quot;have to bother with him while<br/>\n&quot;daughter&quot; is in choir practice!&quot;  The rest of us Mom&#39;s have infants,<br/>\ntoddlers and sometimes older siblings all playing at our feet and with<br/>\neachother while waiting for siblings in choir.  She also is one that asks me<br/>\nhow I can homeschool because she would be bored at home all day with kids<br/>\nand doesn&#39;t know how I get time to myself, etc.  I&#39;m never bored and my kids<br/>\nare independant enough that I get many moments during the day to &quot;do my own<br/>\nthing&quot;  I especially like that I don&#39;t have to live my life according to the<br/>\nschool&#39;s schedule and drive my kids all over kingdom come.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnough out of me for now!<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth O<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.tripod.com/BerthasBabies/welcome.html\">http://members.tripod.com/BerthasBabies/welcome.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.tripod.com/BerthasBabies/berthasbabies.html\">http://members.tripod.com/BerthasBabies/berthasbabies.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2396,"nextTopicId":2401}}
