She told me upstairs that she wanted to introduce <br/>\nme to this one person (by name) and I said &quot;mom or kid?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kid, but her mom&#39;s (that name) too.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Cool!  Where is she?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Barbieland.&quot; (the closet under the stairs)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I went downstairs and she introduced me.  They had come to our house to <br/>\nget Holly&#39;s rollerblades and a pair of socks for one of the other girls I&#39;ve <br/>\nknown for years, who had her bike here.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked a bit about roller blades and bikes.  One of the girls had ridden a <br/>\nbike once while wearing roller blades, just to get her dog home (some <br/>\nemergency).    <br/>\n<br/>\nToday is overcast and misty--unusual for here--and so it&#39;s a little cool, but <br/>\nnot cold.  Holly left earlier wearing shorts, a long-sleeved shirt and a <br/>\nsleeveless denim vest.  The vest was on the floor and I asked her if she was going <br/>\nto wear it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No, it&#39;s not that cold.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne girl was wearing a light turtleneck and jeans.  <br/>\nOne was wearing jeans and a sleeveless top.<br/>\nThe new girl put the breaks on the whole giddy, happy little exchange with <br/>\nthis:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My mom made me wear a long-sleeved shirt.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tone of voice was resentful and embarrassed.  The other girls had chosen, <br/>\nprobably with some motherly advice and permission (Holly had asked me for <br/>\nadvice--whether she should take a pair of pants in a pack or not bother, and we <br/>\ndecided no).  They were across the street from a homeschooler&#39;s house.  They <br/>\nwere three blocks from ours.  Clothes can be borrowed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it was noticeable to me after the variety of clothing choices of the other <br/>\ngirls and this girls unhappiness and being heavily clothed against her will <br/>\nreminded me SO much of my own childhood and of kids having so little freedom to <br/>\nchoose, and then lying and sneaking to wear what they wanted to wear.     We <br/>\nweren&#39;t building relationships with our parents.  We weren&#39;t learning to make <br/>\ngood decisions.  We were learning to sneak, lie, to be resentful and to figure <br/>\nout how to get away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey skated away (Holly carrying the fourth set of skates in a homeschooling <br/>\nconference bag &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI went upstairs to make quesadillas for Marty, who was playing a WWII game on <br/>\nKirby&#39;s computer, and Keith (I had to hunt him down, but he was repairing his <br/>\narmor, in the garage).   I had fun, listening to Elton John, making tea, <br/>\nmaking quesadillas nobody had asked for, that were just going to be surprise <br/>\ngift-snacks, and I remembered the idea that housework was drudgery.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I looked around me as objectively as I could.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kitchen&#39;s cluttered.  I had scrubbed sinks and surfaces earlier today, but <br/>\nthere are things on the table that should be put away, and things on the <br/>\ncounter that belong in other rooms, and the CD player Elton John was in was on top <br/>\nof the basket of plastic containers, and I was about to bop away and do other <br/>\nmore fun things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel guilty.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could easily have a cleaner and more unhappy house.  Few people would blame <br/>\nme.  <br/>\nI have chosen to have a happy and less clean house.   But it&#39;s been an <br/>\nespecially happy house lately, and I&#39;m interested in keeping it that way as long as <br/>\npossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be bad things, and sad things, and frustrations in my kids lives.  <br/>\nThey will find sorrow and grief out there, when they least expect it.

I wish I had just let my dd14 play when she wanted to instead of nagging her to practice. It really did make it about playing (music) being work.And the sad thing was she really was playing enough for her to get better. Luckily it did not entirely kill her love of music, but did affect it. After a break from piano lessons we&#39;re  now looking for a teacher or mentor that will work with her and never mention practice- she can do it if she pleases, or not. <br/>\nThat &#39;mythos&#39; (love it) is still inside me sometimes, and it is in almost everyone else I meet. I&#39;m trying not to let it get through to my kids.....sigh.<br/>\nNoticing that hardly anyone else truly has the priority of people before things.... my husb. certainly doesn&#39;t.
