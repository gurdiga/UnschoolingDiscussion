It seems if I make like 4 loaves <br/>\nof Bananna bread, then they only want a few slices and it won&#39;t even be <br/>\nfinished.  Or cookies.  But if we only get a couple boxes of little debbie snacks <br/>\nthey want to eat them all right then and there.  Seems when there&#39;s no &quot;fear&quot; <br/>\nthat the food will run out before they get a little bit more, they aren&#39;t as <br/>\ndesperate to gorge on it (this is especially true of the foster kids, 2 of who <br/>\ntheir grandfather locked the food away in padlocked kitchen cupboards.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know too, for me, when I&#39;m on a low carb diet, the sweet craving is <br/>\nTERRIBLE...until I haven&#39;t had any sweets for a few days.

I can remember feeling that way about  limited-quantity foods where it wouldn&#39;t be easy to just make more (like, for example, take-out pizza) when I was 6 or 7. <br/>\n<br/>\n Do they feel that they can cause candy to appear whenver they want to(write it on the shopping list, cause a special trip to be made to buy candy, etc.) or does it appear only at adult wishes?  Is there candy all the time -- or just some times?  What does &quot;a lot&quot; mean for bringing candy home? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter was 3 or 4, I remember we went through a period when she needed to have more than she could possibly eat (of whatever -- pasta, grapes, candy, anything really) on her plate before she would eat.  Then she would stop when full -- not eating it all.  My working guess was that she wanted to feel secure that she really would be able to eat as much as she wanted.  Sometime in the last couple of years she stopped doing that - but I wonder if it is a somehow related phenomenon? <br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, I dont&#39; know.

No limits=an eventual saturation point, <br/>\nwhere kids won&#39;t overeat candy. Limits=setting up a craving so when <br/>\nthere is no one to limit them, they&#39;ll go nuts. Is that the general <br/>\nidea?<br/>\n<br/>\nwell, I&#39;ve seen just exactly the opposite happen. Candy/sweets is one <br/>\nthing we&#39;ve never stressed about. If there&#39;s some in the house, it <br/>\nisn&#39;t a big deal if the kids eat it. And they usually eat it all. For <br/>\ninstance, all the Halloween candy is gone, except my 15 year old&#39;s. <br/>\nShe&#39;s got hers hidden in her room. If she didn&#39;t, her sibs would eat <br/>\nit all gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIOW, if there has been candy around, we haven&#39;t limited the kids <br/>\nexcept to say &quot;Stay out of your sister&#39;s&quot;...same with maple bars, <br/>\ncookies, etc. My husband has an amazing sweet tooth and brings the <br/>\nstuff home a lot. In this house it has NEVER been limited, unless I&#39;m <br/>\nmaking a nice dinner. Then, no snacks within an hour before dinner <br/>\ntime. This isn&#39;t every day, though. Just the once in awhile family <br/>\ndinner that I&#39;d prefer they come to the table hungry enough to eat <br/>\nit. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nand they still eat sweets without stopping, until they are gone. If <br/>\nthere is sweet stuff in the house, they eat it. Including honey and <br/>\nsugar. My youngest uses iced tea as a vehicle for sugar: about three <br/>\nTBSP per glass of tea, several glasses per day. Both of the younger <br/>\nones will dip into the honey...a spoon or a finger...many different <br/>\ntimes per day. I&#39;ve had to ask them to stop that, as honey is very <br/>\nexpensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet, a friend who keeps a jar of candy out at her house, with three <br/>\nkids, and they don&#39;t touch it. The same candy will sit on that table <br/>\nfor a half a year. IOW, she hasn&#39;t limited her kids, either, yet they <br/>\ndon&#39;t eat it all gone, as mine do. A bowl of candy sitting out would <br/>\nget eaten UP, that day, at my house.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhy? What DOES bring about self-limiting, really? seems to me, no <br/>\nlimits isn&#39;t really what causes kids to stop themselves. No limits <br/>\nhasn&#39;t caused my kids to stop themselves, until the candy is gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust an observation; it truly is something I haven&#39;t ever made rules <br/>\nabout...<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, HeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If candy is limited to three, and children eat three, parents <br/>\n </span></blockquote>assume they <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; would have eaten four without the limit.

There are <br/>\nvery real things that you can do to help reduce the risk of diabetes, <br/>\nright now, even if you did not breastfeed for the two years currently <br/>\nbeing recommended by the World Health Organization.  You can model good <br/>\neating habits yourself.  You can exercize yourself.

Our family candy rule is 3 pieces<br/>\n&gt; per day after a healthy meal... <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But by labeling food &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; you are again putting that <br/>\n&quot;forbidden Fruit&quot; idea into the kid&#39;s heads.  You can ONLY eat your <br/>\ncookie IF you eat all your veggies.  The kid thinks... hmmm, I know the <br/>\ncookie is good, but man, I sure hate brussel sprouts, so veggies are <br/>\nbad, cookie good, but mom doesn&#39;t want me to have cookies.... My kids <br/>\nhave no food limits.  They are as likely to eat brussel sprouts as they <br/>\nare a cookie.  Neither is good, neither is bad.  They are just food. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (and they are welcome to throw away and try<br/>\n&gt; again if they hate something, so it&#39;s actually 3...).<br/>\n&gt;     They are 9 and 7 and they have no problem with limits.on TV, movies,<br/>\n&gt; computer time, candy consumption, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do they not have problems or do they just know that their opinion is not <br/>\nimportant and therefore it is not worth them discussing their problems. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think the thing to consider about<br/>\n&gt; &quot;limits&quot; is how they are implemented... the negative effects of limits, eg<br/>\n&gt; &quot;rebound&quot; behavior such as the gorging on video games or candy that have<br/>\n&gt; been mentioned are more likely to occur when the limits are imposed <br/>\n&gt; without<br/>\n&gt; rational explanation and discussion, especially in families where rules of<br/>\n&gt; all kinds tend to get imposed and enforced arbitrarily.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I disagree. <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I trust my children to set their own limits. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In our family we<br/>\n&gt; all agree that there are good reasons to limit some behaviors and to try<br/>\n&gt; lots of different activities.  But we do this in an atmosphere of mutual<br/>\n&gt; respect and always with lots of discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is good but if the final decision is made by the adult, the kids <br/>\nknow this and realize that their opinions and needs are not as important <br/>\nas the adults. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; anne<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

(There *are* other options besides control even for<br/>\nspecial circumstances.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids are not overweight, then you are imposing a solution to a<br/>\nproblem that you only fear may exist in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf by late onset diabetes you mean type 2, the connection isn&#39;t directly to<br/>\nsugar but to being overweight. The problem is taking in too many calories<br/>\nand not expending enough and becoming overweight. Being overweight doesn&#39;t<br/>\ncause type 2 diabetes, e.g. all overweight people become diabetic, but being<br/>\noverweight seems to be a factor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; my kids recognize that when they do eat a ton of sugar (say<br/>\n&gt; after a birthday party or what have you) they feel physically ill and<br/>\n&gt; grumpy...

It would suggest to me that she was memorizing rules rather than<br/>\nlearning what&#39;s right for her by experimentation. We try to help people see<br/>\nthat children will choose what&#39;s right for *them*, though, not choose what<br/>\nwe&#39;d choose for them. They *will* choose differently.
