So far we&#39;re favourable impressed with<br/>\nit.<br/>\nHer choice is the public system even though we would have loved it if<br/>\nshe had chosen to homeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like read (a lot!), to knit and crochet, want to get back into<br/>\nwatercolour painting, play around on the keyboard, relearning French.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarryl is into Bar-b-que ing and is building himself a smoker.<br/>\nHe is wanting to get into robotics and play around with that with<br/>\nNathan.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe both help out where we can with our provincial Homeschool support<br/>\ngroup.
