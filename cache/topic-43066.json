Many parents say no for <br/>\nits own sake because they think it is good for their kids.  Just as <br/>\nthey don&#39;t think children can learn naturlly, they think children <br/>\nwon&#39;t naturally get the message that they can&#39;t always have what they <br/>\nwant when they want it without imposing deprivation on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I played a game of cards with my dd.  She wanted to play <br/>\nanother one and I was really tired and I said &quot;I am really tired.  I <br/>\njust want to go to sleep.  We can play again tomorrow.&quot;  She said ok <br/>\nand didn&#39;t whine and insist, I think in part because when she says &quot;I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to do that right now.....&quot; to me, I respect that.

Often, I think guys don&#39;t <br/>\ntake no seriously--they think they don&#39;t really mean it. It&#39;s what <br/>\ngirls are supposed to say just like it is what parents are supposed <br/>\nto say when their kid wants a cookie right before dinner.  I think <br/>\nthis comes in part from not being raised to live mindfully.  I think  <br/>\nit, in part, comes from the frequency with which parents say no to  <br/>\na request off the cuff because they don&#39;t want to be bothered or <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to spoil their children.  And then, when the child whines <br/>\nand argues (as in why can&#39;t I) and the parent runs out of reasonble <br/>\nthings to say or just wants the kid to stop, they just say &quot;Oh <br/>\nOKAAAAY already!!!!!!!&quot;  If no is used sparingly, and only when there <br/>\nis a real reason for it--including respecting the parents&#39; boundaries-<br/>\n-it carries much more meaning.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n When I was in college, I was dating a guy and he wanted me to spend <br/>\nthe night.  We were both tired, and I didn&#39;t want to drive home.  I <br/>\ntold him clearly I did not want to have sex.  He said ok we didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave to--we can jsut cuddle.  I told him clearly, at least two more <br/>\ntimes that I really meant it I did not want to have sex.  He assured <br/>\nme he was ok with that--I believed him.  Later, he started pressuring <br/>\nme to have sex.  It wasn&#39;t because I was afraid to say no.

Statements of Faith (required by so many <br/>\ngroups all over the country) don&#39;t even always include all fundamentalists.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples:<br/>\n<br/>\nFamily Association for Instruction and Teaching at Home<br/>\n<br/>\n1. We believe the Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, to be the inspired <br/>\nWord of God, without error, the revelation of his will for the salvation of <br/>\nmen. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. We believe in one God, Creator of all things, infinitely perfect and <br/>\neternally existing in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. We believe that Jesus Christ is true God and true man, having been <br/>\nconceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He died on the <br/>\ncross, the sacrifice for our sins according to the scriptures. Further, He <br/>\narose bodily from the dead, ascended into heaven, where at the right hand of <br/>\nthe Majesty on High, He is our Priest and Advocate. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. We believe that the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the Lord <br/>\nJesus Christ, and during this age to convict men, regenerate the believing <br/>\nsinner, indwell, guide, instruct, and empower the believer for godly living <br/>\nand sacrifice. <br/>\n<br/>\n5. We believe the shed blood of Jesus Christ and His resurrection provide the <br/>\nonly ground for justification and salvation for all who believe, and only <br/>\nthose who receive Jesus Christ are born of the Holy Spirit, and thus become <br/>\nchildren of God. <br/>\n<br/>\n6. We believe in the personal and imminent coming of our Lord Jesus Christ <br/>\nand that this &quot;Blessed Hope&quot; has a vital bearing on the personal life and <br/>\nservice of the believer. <br/>\n<br/>\n7. We believe in the bodily resurrection of the dead; of the believer to <br/>\neverlasting blessedness and joy with the Lord; of the unrepentant to judgment <br/>\nand everlasting conscious punishment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStatement of Faith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe believe the Bible to be the only infallible authoritative Word of God. (II <br/>\nTim. 3:16) <br/>\n<br/>\nWe believe God is one divine Spirit eternally manifested as Father, Son and <br/>\nHoly Spirit. (Jn 10:29f; Jn 10:30 ; Jn 15:26) <br/>\n<br/>\nWe believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His <br/>\nsinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His <br/>\nshed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of <br/>\nthe Father, and in His visible and physical return to earth. <br/>\nWe believe all have sinned and as a result are alienated from God (Rom. 3:23, <br/>\n5:12), and that eternal redemption is only brought about by faith in the <br/>\nfinished work of the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. 10: 9-10; Eph. 2:8-9). <br/>\n<br/>\nWe believe that if one rejects the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ, he <br/>\nsubjects himself to eternal damnation and separation from God the Father and <br/>\nwill spend eternity in a literal place called hell (Rev. 21:8). <br/>\n<br/>\nWe believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, by whose indwelling, <br/>\nthe Christian is enabled to live a godly life. (Rom. 8:13-14; I Cor. 3:16, <br/>\n6:19-20; Eph. 4:30, 5:18). <br/>\n<br/>\nWe believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Another Intro, while we&#39;re at it...","postDate":"1031431306","msgId":43248,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5OUZEQ0NBLkNCQ0UlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGFsYjZiNCtlc3B1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43241,"nextInTopic":43256,"prevInTime":43247,"nextInTime":43249,"topicId":43066,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... *She* sounded like she was on the right track :-) But that s not the current philosophy that gets put into practice in the Montessori schools, is it?

I don&#39;t see anything wrong in setting up a room full of <br/>\nwhatever will interest the kids. I sometimes wish I had a room to do that. <br/>\nMy stuff is all over the house!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer to see unschooling as child led. For us that means whatever they <br/>\nwant to do. I once heard another unschooler discussing learning with one of <br/>\nher children. The child wasn&#39;t coming up with any ideas for the following <br/>\nday and the mother said &quot;Well, we have to learn something!&quot;<br/>\nTo me, that wasn&#39;t unschooling. The child would have learned something even <br/>\nif she just played all day long. That seemed forced to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy one daughter happens to love worksheets. So she does them. I make sure <br/>\nshe always has them available and she does them when she wants to. I never <br/>\nsuggest that it&#39;s time to do paper work or anything like that. And she can <br/>\ndo them or not do them or quit them whenever she wants.<br/>\nSome children seem to like more structure than others and if that&#39;s what the <br/>\nchild wants, then I think that&#39;s okay too. As long as one isn&#39;t strongly <br/>\nsuggesting, which I see some unschoolers do, or mapping out wht the child <br/>\n&quot;needs&quot; to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67505886,"authorName":"Helen Colbeck","from":"Helen Colbeck &lt;the_colbecks@...&gt;","profile":"helencolbeck","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Another Intro, while we&#39;re at it...","postDate":"1031312599","msgId":43066,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5OUUwRDE2LjEyRkQ4JXRoZV9jb2xiZWNrc0BzeW1wYXRpY28uY2E+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43084,"prevInTime":43065,"nextInTime":43067,"topicId":43066,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi there, I just joined recently, and have been lurking, so I suppose I ought to speak up...

We decided to homeschool this past spring, when I<br/>\npulled my eldest out of her (so-called) Montessori school, and our whole<br/>\nfamily (well, apart from Evelyn, I suppose) is pretty excited about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in Barrie, Ontario, and if there are any unschoolers in our area,<br/>\nplease speak up!!  We need some buddies - all my daughter&#39;s friends are back<br/>\nto school, and although she doesn&#39;t want to join their ranks, she is feeling<br/>\na bit lonely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we decided to homeschool, we started casting about, looking for a<br/>\n&#39;plan&#39;, and unschooling really does seem to be it.  I am curious about how<br/>\nrigid the definition of &#39;unschooling&#39; is?  The things that appeal to me<br/>\nabout it (read: the ideas I have selected to adopt :-)) are the lack of an<br/>\norganized curriculum, or timeline for knowledge/skill acquisition, and the<br/>\nfact that my daughters are the ones to guide and lead their own development.<br/>\nIt is easy for people to see how this is right for the little one (some how<br/>\nshe has learned to walk without any lessons or &#39;equipment&#39; LOL), but squirm<br/>\nwhen I talk about that same idea with my older daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately, my dh is right on board with the unschooling, and really,<br/>\nreally REALLY happy about the homeschooling in general.  Being new to the<br/>\nidea, I am still exploring the ins and outs of unschooling myself, and if he<br/>\nwere unsupportive, I can&#39;t imagine how difficult that would be.   He has<br/>\ncome a looooong way, though, from the guy who was staunchly against me<br/>\nhaving our first at home (she was born there anyway, as was my second, by<br/>\nwhich time he was a total convert), and who didn&#39;t think babies belonged in<br/>\ntheir parents bed (with #2 we didn&#39;t even bother with the crib, just bought<br/>\nthe king-sized bed).  I guess if I can guide him through those paradigm<br/>\nshifts (and others, like vaxing and circumcision), I could have done the<br/>\nsame with this, but I am soooo grateful I don&#39;t have to!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some things, however, that we do that I think may &#39;disqualify&#39; us.<br/>\nI have set up a room here in our house, which has lots of math<br/>\nmanipulatives, language materials, geography stuff - all kinds of things -<br/>\nset out on shelves for her.  My husband started calling it &#39;the classroom&#39;<br/>\nand that name has stuck.  It won&#39;t be a place for &#39;classes&#39; in any sense of<br/>\nthe word - I set it up to make all of those things accessible to her, so she<br/>\ncould explore them, and ask for help and clarification when she wants it.  I<br/>\nprobably will offer &#39;lessons&#39; at times, but she will never have to<br/>\nparticipate against her will.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to clarify, I am trained as a Montessori teacher, and it has obviously<br/>\ninfluenced my approach.  If there was  decent Montessori school in my town,<br/>\nI probably would have left her in there, but I am now so excited by the<br/>\nwhole idea of her being home that even if one moved in tomorrow, I would<br/>\nnever send her!  There is a definite influence there, though, and again, I<br/>\nwonder if that &#39;disqualifies&#39; me as an unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I will be welcome here, as I have been greatly enjoying your<br/>\ndiscussions.  You sound like a pretty cool bunch.  Are there no Christian<br/>\nunschoolers on the list though?  There have been some comments recently that<br/>\nsurprised me, as they would have caused some other lists I have been on to<br/>\nerupt into flames!  For the record, I am UU and my dh is a Zen Buddhist.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I have also been following the Yes vs. No threads.  I have seen this<br/>\nsame thread pop up on other lists, and it always fascinates me.  I find<br/>\nmyself very drawn to the idea of it, but it just never works for me.  I do<br/>\nalways seek the &#39;yes&#39;, but sometimes, for me, the answer is just no.  This<br/>\napplies to my dh, my dd, my mom - everybody in my life.  Sometimes the<br/>\nanswer is just no.  I do have questions for those of you here who never say<br/>\nno to your kids, as I&#39;d like to explore the idea more, but I think that&#39;s<br/>\nfor another time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to those of you who made it ALL the way to the end!<br/>\n<br/>\nH.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43352,"nextTopicId":43538}}
