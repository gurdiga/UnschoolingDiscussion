The kids didn&#39;t wear seatbelts. They mostly sat at the table playing cards or games. We didn&#39;t travel as far as you would be. If I remember correctly it cost around $1200 for the week. I don&#39;t know if that is good or bad but we had fun. I was a little nervous driving it but I got used to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Has anyone ever rented an RV?  We are looking into it as an option for our <br/>\n  SC trip.  I have so many questions, but most important:  what do you do with <br/>\n  the kids?  Are there seatbelts?  Can/should they sleep in the beds while <br/>\n  driving?  What about when they are awake?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m a little freaky about seatbelts being worn and having the little ones in <br/>\n  carseats.  So I wonder if this is a good idea??<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks!<br/>\n  Jennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  Add photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
