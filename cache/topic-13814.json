My name is Sandy and I am Mom <br/>\nto Joshua 5 and Jordan 3.  We are just feeling our way through at the moment, <br/>\nbut things are going well.   The three of us just sort of learn all day and <br/>\nif someone mentions an idea, we follow it.  My son asks me a question about <br/>\nthe different trees in our yard and why they were different etc.  So we got <br/>\nsome paper and a crayon and he make bark rubbings.  He collect the leaves <br/>\nfrom each tree and also collected any berries or nuts the tree had.  We <br/>\ntalked about the differences for a while and bagged everything up so that we <br/>\ncan get a book or check online to identify the trees and find out more about <br/>\neach one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter likes to do everything her older brother does.  When I first <br/>\nthought to homeschool  last summer I didn&#39;t even know about unschooling and I <br/>\nhad all the ideas of age appropriate lessons and so forth for my son without <br/>\neven considering my daughter.  Of course I had no &quot;legal obligation&quot; to <br/>\nschool her.  Silly me so immersed in the ps way of thinking I had been <br/>\nexcluding my daughter from all my plans.  Then I found unschooling and <br/>\nrealize that she can learn too.  Duh!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it is overwhelming and sometimes scary ( putting him in school <br/>\nwould have seemingly taken the responsibility of his education from me when <br/>\nall along it was MY responsibility anyway) but always fun and always a <br/>\nlearning experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day in the car my daughter said puh, puh, puh puppy starts with a <br/>\nk.  Of course it doesn&#39;t, but it amazed me that she was realizing that words <br/>\nare made up of sounds.  I did not sit down with her and &quot;teach&quot; her this.  <br/>\nShe just absorbed it by being around my son and me when we were discussing <br/>\nletter sounds.  That experience really helped me to see that kids do indeed <br/>\nlearn naturally if given the exposure to learning opportunities.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and I look forward to learning the ropes right along with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Debra Caruso","from":"Debra Caruso &lt;freespiritwolf@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"l1lCnOl5fAG6J_NUIpuG1JpCjeaAX14PDQlZeAdyVrnnjQLT-3zd_Dm6F37yvlRi7Y0fXEIN0sOajYVsniuiUrK1w8-oQgL5b3xBLKXcfXhp","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [[Unschooling-dotcom] new member]","postDate":"972772539","msgId":13814,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAxMDI4MjIzNTM5LjI3OTI4LnFtYWlsQHd3dzB1Lm5ldGFkZHJlc3MudXNhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13815,"prevInTime":13813,"nextInTime":13815,"topicId":13814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello and welcome!I am new to unschooling but not to homeschooling in general.My name is Debbie I am mom to 4 sons 20,19,18,and 12.My oldest did better with a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1041036176\"><br>\n&quot; In the midst of winter,I found within me an invincible summer&quot; Albert Camus\nIcq number  87168064\nWe are courageous,we are brave,we are the survivors......deb<br>\n<br>\n<hr noshade width=\"90%\">\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.netscape.com/webmail\">http://home.netscape.com/webmail</a>.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13812,"nextTopicId":13816}}
