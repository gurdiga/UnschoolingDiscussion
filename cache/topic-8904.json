Thank you! --Becky<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Becky,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with unschooling is that it is basically not doing <br/>\nsomething; i.e. not schooling, so it is very difficult to spend a lot of <br/>\ntime talking about what we are not doing.   However to me <br/>\nunschooling is more of a lifestyle than a method of education, so <br/>\nthis makes any topic at all relevant to an unschooling mailing list, <br/>\nand pertenant to unschooling itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example my children follow no curriculum & have no <br/>\nworksheets, they do nothing purely for the purpose of learning, but <br/>\nafter saying that I must add that nearly all of what they do <br/>\nencourages and fosters learning.   Home is a 175 acre farm, with a <br/>\n600&#39; hill, a valley with two trout stream, ponds, animals etc.  They <br/>\nhave a microscope, many books, pencils, paper, computers with <br/>\nall kinds of programes and they have responsibilities.   Right now <br/>\nmy 11 year old daughter has gone to Chicago with a family who <br/>\nvisited the farm two weekends ago, their daughter ended up staying <br/>\nhere last week and when her Mother came back to get her Rhianon <br/>\nwent with them.  This is amazing to me considering that I only met <br/>\nthese people 11 days ago, but we meet some really great people <br/>\nand strong friendships are sometimes formed.    Anyway where I <br/>\nwas heading was to say that with Rhianon away, Madeleine [6] has <br/>\nto take the responsibility of milking the goat, Stephanie [4] is <br/>\nhelping her and they collect the eggs from the chicken coop <br/>\nwithout being remended.  Milking the goat was Rhianon&#39;s descision <br/>\nas she wanted to bottle feed some kids, so I told ehr that to bottle <br/>\nfeed kids she would have to milk a goat so they could be reared on <br/>\nfresh goat milk, she took this responsibility on the first day of <br/>\nFebruary and until she went away yesterday has only missed one <br/>\nmilking when she was sick one day.  Nathan [15] bottle rears three <br/>\ndairy calves at a time and takes care of most of the feeding of the <br/>\nanimals, he can drive a truck, tractor, van and is just getting the <br/>\nhang of a 4 wheel drive pick-up that we bought from auction a few <br/>\nweeks ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome days are too long for all of us and the children all help out <br/>\nwith whatever tasks they are capable of, mostly for the girls that <br/>\ninvolves care of the chickens and chicks, assisting with candling <br/>\neggs and checking the incubators [I&#39;m guessing that we have at <br/>\nleast 1000 chicks that we have hatched this year].  We have 4 <br/>\ncows, 5 heifers, 3 bulls, 12 steers, a boar, 2 sows, a ram, 24 <br/>\newes, 26 lambs, a buck, 8 does, 8 kids, 6 turkeys, 6 domestic <br/>\ngeese, 5 Canada geese and their 9 goslings, 4 ducks and 23 <br/>\nducklings that we have incubated with 10 more due to hatch today <br/>\n[along with about 230 chicks] and of course about 200 chickens & <br/>\nat least 1000 chicks with around 200 more every six days.  So for <br/>\nmy children between the wild creatures living here and the farm <br/>\nanimals biology lessons take care of themselves(-;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the daily tasks are done the kids have the freedom to do <br/>\nwhat they want with their time, Nathan spends a fair bit of time at <br/>\nthe computer on web design or designing cars for GTA, the girls <br/>\nwatch about 1 hour of television but prefer to spend time writing, <br/>\ndrawing playing legos, playing in the sandbox or out exploring.  I <br/>\nam not actively teaching Maddi [6] and Steph [4] how to read, the <br/>\nonly reading lessons they get is having people read to them and <br/>\ngiving answers when asked what a word says or how to spell <br/>\nsomething.  I am not activelty teaching math, day to day life and <br/>\nexpenses does that, for more advanced math if the need for it <br/>\narises such as for Nathan with work on the computer answers are <br/>\nfound by asking or researching.   My children who were in school <br/>\n[Rhianon for 1 1/2 years and Nathan 6 years] have regained their <br/>\nlove of learning that school all but destroyed with it&#39;s mind <br/>\nnumbingly boring games, Madeleine and Stephanie will never have <br/>\nto endure the hours of sitting at a desk being force fed <br/>\nunnecessary information [which is mostly forgotten anyway] just to <br/>\npass some stupid test, they are free to learn at their own pace, if <br/>\nthey don&#39;t read fluently &#39;til they are 12 it won&#39;t matter in fact it may <br/>\nbe good for them as once we become literate the world changes, <br/>\nyes it can be for the better as we are then able to find all the <br/>\ninformation we need in books or on the &#39;net, but by having the <br/>\nability to find what we need from books it partly kills off the <br/>\nscientist [who has to find his/her own answers] that is inate in all <br/>\nnew-born babies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if a few others on the list describe their lives it may help out <br/>\nany newbies who are looking for answers, we were all there once.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sue   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Winona Farm in Minnesota Welcomes Unschoolers All Year Round<br/>\nMy website:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e\">http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e</a><br/>\nFarm website:    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/\">http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/</a><br/>\nFarm newsletter: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To believe in something, and not to live it, <br/>\n is to be dishonest.&quot;   -Mahatma Gandhi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"bjackson","from":"&quot;bjackson&quot; &lt;beckyjackson@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"P6ilVXpw29ILDQO74zUGW_XhprjqFUGNIMD25xDqjj3MYa4vrS-s4dWq58rVa_N_UIh37uU3c8tDhGkWkofe5fMRk1jPzUf9jayu","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Need unschooling input!","postDate":"960176364","msgId":8904,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNjA1MDQwMC5YQUExMjc3N0BtYWlsLmFsbHRlbC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8910,"prevInTime":8903,"nextInTime":8905,"topicId":8904,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello!
