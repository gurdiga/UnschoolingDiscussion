Yes, these are serious times.  And serious <br/>\ntimes call for serious laughter.  Why?<br/>\n<br/>\n  . Laughter actually and literally heals by releasing toxins and<br/>\nunwanted memories from our cells.<br/>\n .  Laughter releases emotion, and paves the way for clarity and<br/>\nforgiveness.<br/>\n .  Laughter is a political act;  it helps us overcome our irony<br/>\ndeficiency and political powerlessness, and encourages us to handle<br/>\nthe underlying imbalance instead of fussing about the symptoms.  Or,<br/>\nas Swami would say, &quot;Here is my simple alternative to the war on<br/>\ndrugs:  Improve Reality!&quot;<br/>\n .  Laughter is a learning tool.  It exposes the foolish nonsense we<br/>\nhave been tricked into believing, and opens the mind to new<br/>\npossibilities.<br/>\n .  Laughter helps heal the spirit. It opens the clown chakra to <br/>\nremind us that indeed we are all cosmic comic clowns under the same<br/>\nBig Top.
