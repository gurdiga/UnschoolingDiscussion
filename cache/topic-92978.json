When I worked at Microsoft, most of <br/>\nthe people I know started out in computers as self-taught. We were <br/>\nthe generation whose parents had an Atari or an Apple IIe, or even a <br/>\nTRS-80. Everything on computers was learned via Unschooling, in a <br/>\nsense, because schools hadn&#39;t yet caught on to it. I wonder, now that <br/>\ncomputers are taught as a subject starting in early gradeschool, if <br/>\nthe people graduating with computer science degrees in 12 or 15 years <br/>\nwill have so much less creativity and ability to think outside the <br/>\nbox with respect to programming, because someone taught them exactly <br/>\nhow to do it instead of discovering it for themselves. I wonder if <br/>\nthe U.S. will lose their edge in the computer software industry <br/>\neventually because of this. I think we have had the edge for a long <br/>\ntime because most of our great programmers were self-taught and <br/>\ncreative and innovative.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"younger unschooler/scomputers","postDate":"1082571537","msgId":92978,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFmMC4xZTgzODEyYi4yZGI4MTUxMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":92980,"prevInTime":92977,"nextInTime":92979,"topicId":92978,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... kids loathe and avoid computers because they associate them with school crap.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-362750183\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They will probably succeed in making a large segment of a generation of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>kids <br/>\nloathe and avoid computers because they associate them with school <br/>\ncrap.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat happened to Cameron.
