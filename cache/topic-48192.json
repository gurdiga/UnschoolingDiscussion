By the third time they watched <br/>\nit, they did view a few more parts than the first time because they <br/>\nhad gotten used to the story line, but there were still parts that <br/>\nneither of them wanted to see.

Sometimes I&#39;ll figure that a movie is bad <br/>\nfor kids to watch alone but ok if a parent is sitting beside him <br/>\ndiscussing it with him.  Sometimes I&#39;ll tell him that it&#39;s trash and <br/>\nwhy (at his level).  Sometimes you need to have violence to be <br/>\nrealistic--like in a war movie.  I don&#39;t usually end up having a <br/>\nproblem with violence on movies except that my 9 year old is very <br/>\nsensitive to it and gets upset by it easily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a website somewhere that you can order movies and tell <br/>\nthem which scenes to edit out. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t tell you where it <br/>\nis, but if you&#39;re interested I&#39;m sure you&#39;d be able to find it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Amie&quot; &lt;tcee1@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Ok, I am pretty new to this, but I am wondering about what happens <br/>\nif your 5 year old says he is really interested in a rated R movie, <br/>\nor what if he said he wanted a new video game called Hitman or <br/>\nsomething like this?
