How insecure would I get? Couple that <br/>\nwith endless magazines speculating further and I wonder how  any marriages <br/>\nin Hollywood survive.**<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my favorite shows is Alias....well was, I haven&#39;t seen it in a couple <br/>\nof months...but anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend and I were talking about Sydney&#39;s first kiss with Vaughn (sp).  <br/>\nOMG!  The steam and chemistry was just oooozing!!  Not that that would be <br/>\nhard, I mean Michael Vartan...oo-la-la!  And Jennifer Garner ain&#39;t so bad <br/>\nherself, iykwim! ;P  I&#39;d kiss those lips! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nI digress.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t long after that she and Scott Foley announced they were splitting <br/>\nup.  I&#39;ve heard rumors that she and Michael Vartan are possibly an item, but <br/>\nwhatever.  Now, I too cannot imagine being married to an actor and watching <br/>\nhim suck face and whatever else with beautiful women all day, but if I were <br/>\nJennifer Garner and *had* to go around kissing Michael Vartan all day???  <br/>\nI&#39;d have to hope that my husband and I were on *tight*.  I mean, those two <br/>\nhave amazing chemistry.  I don&#39;t think you can fake it that well.  I have no <br/>\nidea why they broke up other than their scheduling conflicts, which would be <br/>\nenough to kill any marriage, even a happy one, but I can well see where <br/>\nScott would have every reason to be jealous.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer  (I think we found a house!!!!  Going to look inside in the <br/>\nmorning.  Yippeee!!!)<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71497,"nextTopicId":71761}}
