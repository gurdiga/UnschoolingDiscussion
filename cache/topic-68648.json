The biggest reason my <br/>\nhusband and i did this is because of the peer pressure crap that comes from <br/>\npublic school.  My oldest had just started Middle School (our elementary <br/>\nschool here was excellent, small and personable), and being the smallest <br/>\nchild in his class, not to mention gifted, he was teased...ALOT.  So....he <br/>\nstopped doing his work....started getting into trouble....had a MAJOR <br/>\nattitude problem.  *sigh*  So i figured, &quot;What the heck?  What do i have to <br/>\nlose?&quot;  His attitude changed IMMEDIATELY!  He started excelling in his <br/>\nlearning, because he was learning about things he wanted to AND no one was <br/>\nteasing him for being smart.  Needless to say we just finished up our third <br/>\nyear unschooling and the boys are so bright.  We have a fantastic <br/>\nrelationship, and they are truly GOOD kids.....not to say we don&#39;t have our <br/>\nmoments, i mean, afterall, they ARE teenagers!
