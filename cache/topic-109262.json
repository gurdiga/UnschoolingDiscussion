You can see pictures of their costumes at <br/>\nwww.naturallynhkids.com/pb/wp_6a878265.html.  This was the first year <br/>\nthat Nathaniel seemed to have a sense of what was happening.  After a <br/>\nfew houses, he would call out as he turned to leave, &quot;Bye ... Happy <br/>\nHalloween.&quot;  Madeleine would then call cheerfully as we walked <br/>\naway, &quot;Bye ... bye ... bye ... bye ... bye ... bye ...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe earlier part of the day was rather exhausting!  My in-laws <br/>\ninsisted on having us drive to their house so they could see the kids <br/>\nin their costumes.  Of course, they only had limited times available <br/>\nin their schedules.  So, we ended up going over in the early <br/>\nafternoon and then waiting for the city&#39;s events to start.  The kids <br/>\nenjoyed the hay ride, story time, and face painting.  The pictures <br/>\nwith Big Bird and Cookie Monster were too overwhelming.  We also <br/>\nended up waiting in line for 20 minutes at the fire station.  That <br/>\nwould have been fine if there had been fire engines inside to explore <br/>\nbut it was just a food line for pizza, which my kids couldn&#39;t eat <br/>\nanyway.  So, that was a bit frustrating.  Also, we had just spent 10 <br/>\nminutes waiting in line for the hay ride.  This was compounded by the <br/>\nfact that the family waiting behind us were not very understanding <br/>\nwith their 2-year-old who was having a hard time waiting in line, <br/>\nespecially since his dad insisted that he was not to be held.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was fun seeing a lot of families we know all dressed up in <br/>\ncostumes :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnie <br/>\n-- <br/>\nwww.naturallynhkids.com <br/>\nGreat parenting is a great career!
