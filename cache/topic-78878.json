There are no unschooling principles to memorize.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere *are* though principles that we do accept as true because we&#39;ve<br/>\n*already* done the critical examination and have come to those conclusions.<br/>\nThe list and message board exist as places to explore what life is like when<br/>\nthose unschooling principles are accepted as true.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that people can&#39;t question whether children do learn all they need<br/>\nto learn by living life, or whether conventional parenting is better than<br/>\nmindful parenting, but they need to do so softly so it doesn&#39;t stop the list<br/>\nfrom serving the needs of those who accept the unschooling principles and<br/>\nsigned on to work towards unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an analogy, many priests wouldn&#39;t discourage and might even encourage<br/>\nsomeone who wants to question the divinity of Christ. But the priest (and<br/>\nparishoners) wouldn&#39;t want the person interupting the church services to get<br/>\nthe priest to prove the divinity of Christ. The service exists to serve the<br/>\nvast majority who already accept the divinity of Christ. The priest probably<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want to spend hours a day in private discussing the divinity of<br/>\nChrist. The priest would expect the person to do the majority of the work on<br/>\ntheir own and to use the priest to help clarify some thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough understanding the foundation of a particular religion&#39;s dogma can be<br/>\nhelpful to people, I think they can also work just fine for people who don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to question, who just want to believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think unschooling will work for those who just want to accept. I<br/>\nthink people need to understand why it works in order to decide how to make<br/>\nit work in their families.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Why does someone want &quot;To imbue with a partisan or ideological point of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; view&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In religion in particular, it&#39;s because there is a belief system, dogma,<br/>\n&gt; things that are true and right within that religion, and things that are not.<br/>\n&gt; If <br/>\n&gt; I ,a libertarian dem, want to understand republicanism, I can&#39;t do it without<br/>\n&gt; looking at if from their ideological pov.  There are things I need to &quot;accept<br/>\n&gt; as correct&quot; before I can go further into their ideology.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Almost. You need to accept as correct *from their point of view*. And then<br/>\nwork to understand their point of view in order to understand why they<br/>\nbelieve what they believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does mean turning off your own point of view and preconceived notions in<br/>\norder to understand. But it doesn&#39;t mean letting your own understanding go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that process fascinting and have tried to describe it to some people<br/>\nwho are fighting what we&#39;re saying. Some people seem to naturally resist<br/>\ntaking on that temporary set of beliefs and temporary point of view and<br/>\ntemporary new truths. But I find it fascinating -- and very helpful -- to<br/>\ntry to understand why people believe what they believe. I find<br/>\nfundamentalist Christian thinking fascinating. I&#39;ve been able to better<br/>\nunderstand why they believe what they do by trying on their point of view.<br/>\nBut I&#39;m not in the least bit &quot;indoctrinated&quot; into their beliefs. My own<br/>\nbeliefs haven&#39;t changed at all just because I&#39;ve tried on theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me indoctrination is done *to* someone. It is done to meet *the<br/>\nindoctrinator&#39;s* needs. The people being indoctrinated may feel it&#39;s meeting<br/>\ntheir needs. They may even want the indoctrination. But to me the big<br/>\ndifference between indoctrination and learning is that the indoctrinator has<br/>\na driving need to get someone (or many someones) to believe. And whether<br/>\nthey understand or not is irrelevant (and perhaps dangerous to the<br/>\nindoctrinator&#39;s goals.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing indoctrinated and learning something they want to learn may look and<br/>\nfeel similar to the people drawing in the information. But there is no<br/>\npressure from the people handing out the information for anyone to<br/>\nunderstand. No one offering advice has anything big to gain whether there<br/>\nare 100 people or 10,000 people here who understand -- not just believe --<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but indoctrination seems to me to be a complete immersion<br/>\n&gt; in any complete belief system, and that can be done by choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe that&#39;s where connotation and denotation come in. I think there are<br/>\nwords that describe that immersive learning -- like &quot;learning&quot; ;-) -- but<br/>\npeople need a word that describes learning when the person handing out the<br/>\ninformation has a vested interest in the learner believing them.

I find nothing wrong with exploring theoreticals and<br/>\n&gt; hypotheticals, they can be very useful tools when not used too<br/>\n&gt; randomly. Imagining different possibilities, testing out<br/>\n&gt; logical arguments to see if lead to an illogical conclusion, thinking<br/>\n&gt; ahead about future events, etc...it&#39;s all good to me. That&#39;s fine if<br/>\n&gt; you personally aren&#39;t interested in theoreticals...I am.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m interested in theory, but not the way you&#39;re going about it.  As far as<br/>\nthis list goes, I&#39;m interested in real people&#39;s lives and their experience<br/>\nunschooling.  As I attempted to explain above, *advice* based on<br/>\ntheoreticals is worthless.  Tell me if you have actually lived this.  And<br/>\ndon&#39;t try to tell me how to live if you have never been there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure anyone who&#39;s been on this list for more than a few months knows<br/>\nthat my son is seven years old.  That&#39;s because I try HARD to include his<br/>\nage in my comments.  To someone who has a five year old, my experiences may<br/>\nyield something useful.  But the parent of a twelve year old won&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily find my comments useful.  Age does make a difference.  I greatly<br/>\nappreciate advice from some of the more experienced unschoolers on this<br/>\nlist, because I know that they have stood where I&#39;m standing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; your friend (and you, me thinks) has great expectations of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; children&#39;s interest in philosophical questions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re right, we do. Guilty as charged.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And how has that expectation played out in your own children&#39;s lives?  Are<br/>\nthey old enough to bear up your theories?  I am neither a mathmetician nor a<br/>\nscientist, but I do remember (from school, no less) that not all theories<br/>\nturn out to be true.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how old are your children?

You either are of the same belief as the <br/>\ndogma of your religion,  or you are not that religion, you&#39;re a spiritual person <br/>\non a path that has similarities to that religion.  You can be open-mindedly <br/>\nspirtual, no dogma, that&#39;s different.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;very few religions are in the business of open-mindedness, and their <br/>\ndefinitions <br/>\nof other religions are frequently of the basest kinds of judgements. That <br/>\nmeans hatred &gt;&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be a mistake that many people make, but that doesn&#39;t mean that all <br/>\nreligious people are this way.  Some people are so comfortable with their <br/>\nreligion they have no need to hate those who are of another religion.    It&#39;s <br/>\ncalled religious tolerance.  <br/>\n<br/>\n It happens.

But as I explained in my other post, teaching and <br/>\nlearning something so inflexible as religion, does have at it&#39;s base things <br/>\nlike faith, grace, etc, and you just can&#39;t understand some religions without <br/>\nsuspending disbelief, without putting aside critical, rational thinking and <br/>\nquestioning.  It&#39;s just part of the process.

I think <br/>\nthat sometimes that is the only way to truly comprehend something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter you comprehend something, the critical questions can enlarge your <br/>\nunderstanding, but in the beginning, those critical questions can subvert your <br/>\nunderstanding, instead. <br/>\n<br/>\n I know that&#39;s not a great argument for unschooling, but I think it&#39;s true.  <br/>\nIsn&#39;t that why we think it&#39;s great when people read the list for a while, get <br/>\nan understanding of what&#39;s going on first, before they jump in?

Aren&#39;t they learning about an <br/>\nentire system of belief, and don&#39;t they have to suspend their own beliefs while <br/>\nthey do so?  Is that controlling their knowledge, or is that just a method of <br/>\nabsorbing a different pov?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference I see is that you are assuming a person of power to be <br/>\ncoercing another person...but indoctrination seems to me to be a complete immersion <br/>\nin any complete belief system, and that can be done by choice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAren&#39;t people here being indoctrinated in the process of unschooling?

Grey areas, like you said. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve known many &quot;Christian unschoolers&quot; who limit and censor their <br/>\nchild&#39;s activities based upon Scripture, essentially forcing their <br/>\nchild into compliance with the parents&#39; chosen faith and hampering <br/>\nthe child&#39;s freedom to strike his own spiritual path.

A <br/>\nhuman will naturally at some point start to wonder about the big <br/>\nquestions on his own, where we came from and how the earth started <br/>\nand all that stuff--offering answers to those questions before your <br/>\nchild is mature enough to ask them for himself is sort of tainting <br/>\nthe spiritual path, so to speak. (Just my heathen atheist opinion! <br/>\nAgree to disagree, LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a quote from my good friend Henry Lindner:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I say never force children to learn anything outside of their <br/>\nnecessary duties in the family and home. The child can see and <br/>\nunderstand the need for these tasks.  He cannot see the need to learn <br/>\nwho George Washington is and what he did, and he will not until he is <br/>\nmuch older and begins to wonder how his society got to be what it <br/>\nis.  To force him/her to learn such answers before he can even ask <br/>\nthe questions is to forever prevent him from ever having any <br/>\ncuriosity regarding the subject.  To associate knowledge with <br/>\ncoercion in your child&#39;s mind is one of the worst things you can do <br/>\nto him.  Coercion prevents and perverts the child&#39;s <br/>\nemotional/intellectual growth. All meaningful learning is the child&#39;s <br/>\nown accomplishment.

But as you point out,<br/>\nit&#39;s got a flaw, and that&#39;s the period before children are old enough to do<br/>\nthe questioning.  I suspect that John Holt was well wise enough to know<br/>\nthat, and figured that the concept would obviously be applied to the<br/>\nappropriate point in a child&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps an agnostic might think that the whole mess of faith is far<br/>\ncomplicated to even get into with a young child, and would ignore the whole<br/>\nthing until their child is old enough to really consider the issues.
