Rarely do they help people figure <br/>\nout how to decide what numbers need to be calculated in what way to determine <br/>\nsomething, they just teach pre-set-up calculating.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think math comes in waves.  I think it comes in little bursts of <br/>\nunderstanding, little tiny particles of questions and discovery and of <br/>\nfilling in one more little piece in a puzzle without edges, without the <br/>\nflatness of being on one plane, and one-sided like regular jigsaw puzzles, <br/>\nbut some pieces in the past, and some in the future; some theoretical or <br/>\nimagined and some you could weigh or measure at home; some funny and some <br/>\nbeautiful.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach little dot of information can sit for a second or a year before a new <br/>\ndot connects to it.  Some new dots of information might connect to two or <br/>\ntwenty existing pieces of The Big Puzzle.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s either a dog, or it&#39;s a hippopotamus.&quot;<br/>\nNot good math. <br/>\nNot good logic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe vast majority of things in the universe do not resemble a dog OR a hippo <br/>\nin the least little way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65817,"nextTopicId":66373}}
