And we also<br/>\nwant them to be suck-sessful adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe derived our non-traditional definition of sucker from Henry David Thoreau<br/>\n&#39;s words in his classic Walden.  He wrote that he &quot;...went to the woods to<br/>\nlive deliberately...to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA sucker single-mindedly goes after that marrow.  A sucker hungers for<br/>\nknowledge.  A sucker notes the changes of seasons, the migration of birds,<br/>\nthe budding of flowers, the artistry of the morning dew.  A sucker is as<br/>\ncomfortable with the technology of the present as the wisdom of the ages.  A<br/>\nsucker is deeply moved in the face of human triumph or tragedy.  A sucker is<br/>\nall there, fully awake, completely embracing all that life has to offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSound like a worthy goal for children?  We think so.  Here are three steps<br/>\nto help children learn to be suckers:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBe a sucker yourself<br/>\n<br/>\nModel a passion for learning.  Be open-minded.  Try new things all of the<br/>\ntime.  Focus on stockpiling experiences rather than material objects.<br/>\nTravel slowly, stopping and lingering along the way.  Chat with the people<br/>\nyou meet.  Savor your food.  Don&#39;t jump to conclusions.  Pick the minds of<br/>\npeople who know the ropes.  Enjoy sunrises and sunsets. Become adept at<br/>\nlooking through telescopes, microscopes, and just under your nose.  When<br/>\nyour children see how much fun you&#39;re having, nothing will stop them from<br/>\njoining in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGive children time and space<br/>\n<br/>\nOverscheduling our children&#39;s lives may make them into &quot;successes&quot; in the<br/>\neyes of the world, but it won&#39;t help them to be suckers. For that you&#39;ve got<br/>\nto leave them alone.  Let them build their play forts, play their street<br/>\ngames, and experiment in the kitchen.  Encourage creativity.  Expose them to<br/>\nthe very best in life and let them choose what they want.  Give them the<br/>\ntinder and matches, but let them light their own fires of passion.  The<br/>\nability to suck the marrow out of life comes slowly over many years.  So don<br/>\n&#39;t expect immediate, quantifiable results.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSeek inspiration from other suckers<br/>\n<br/>\nMandy and I place our faith in the premise that &quot;a sucker is born every<br/>\nminute.&quot;  We believe that everyone can be a sucker, but too many get lured<br/>\naway from that. They may be led to believe that happiness has to do with<br/>\nmoney, status, or position.  Far too often those pursuits engulf lives, and<br/>\ndistract would-be suckers from the path.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a positive note, you can find real suckers everywhere.  They are the ones<br/>\nwho are involved and active.  They are multi-faceted people, always<br/>\nlearning, always growing, always changing.  Such people need to be  your<br/>\nlifelines.  You can also read about great suckers in history; people who did<br/>\nextraordinary things, who were committed to living each day to the fullest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lifelong quest<br/>\n<br/>\nSuck-sess has to do with cutting through the veneer of life and getting at<br/>\nits essence.  It has to do with throwing out agendas and living<br/>\nspontaneously.   It&#39;s about bringing our exterior world in harmony with our<br/>\ninterior.  It&#39;s about reducing our baggage.  It&#39;s about getting wrapped up<br/>\nin the ecstasy of the moment rather than postponing happiness for a later<br/>\ndate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a nutshell, suck-sess is the nectar of life.  That&#39;s why we&#39;re so intent<br/>\non teaching our children how to be real suckers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen is a professional &quot;rug sucker&quot; (carpet cleaner) in Portland,<br/>\nOregon.
