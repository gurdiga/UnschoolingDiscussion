He hates math too,<br/>\n&gt;so the most I can get him to do is play games, but he is also responsible <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;budgeting his own lunch money for the month(His school is in a city<br/>\n&gt;neighborhood so he goes out to eat or goes to a 7-11 almost every day)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;        However, the fact that he has changed from being an angry, uptight,<br/>\n&gt;worried little boy to a happy, thoughtful, curious , repsonsible and<br/>\n&gt;self-confident 10 year old is amazing. Right now I don&#39;t care if he does <br/>\n&gt;any<br/>\n&gt;academics this year, I&#39;m glad that he has become this wonderful person.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;        Andrea<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99018162,"authorName":"Freedom Panther","from":"&quot;Freedom Panther&quot; &lt;freedompanther@...&gt;","profile":"polarbear48471","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] JUST JOINED!

I&#39;m still <br/>\nafflicted, though, with occasional bouts of CONSTIPATED THINKING (a favorite <br/>\nphrase of mine, which is a term borrowed from the movie, &quot;Finding <br/>\nForrester.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I am still fighting my own way out of the box, which is within yet <br/>\nanother box, and yet another...you get the picture, I still sometimes grasp <br/>\nfor &quot;evidence&quot;  that my son is learning and will not be mentally deficient <br/>\ndue to lack of stimulating and educational opportunities...so I do my best <br/>\nto make &quot;subject matter&quot;  available in interesting, interactive formats.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the reason for this is that I am a self-employed massage/manual <br/>\ntherapist, with my office attached to my home.  It really works out very <br/>\nwell, as I can allow Dylan to be home to follow his interests and make up <br/>\nhis own activities, while I&#39;m earning an income, utilizing the education and <br/>\nexperience that I&#39;ve spent many thousands of dollars and gobs of hours <br/>\nacquiring, fulfilling my own life goals, all with Dylan just on the other <br/>\nside of a closed door.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn between appointments, over long lunch hours, and especially if a client <br/>\ncancels, Dylan and I have time together peppered throughout the day.  <br/>\nEvenings, with Dad home, brings another dimension to our family experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it just makes me, a still-in-my-first-six-months unschooler, feel <br/>\nmore secure to have Dylan getting fun, interactive, learning experiences <br/>\nthrough software and even some Nintendo games with educational content, <br/>\nwhile Dave and I are working...then we have our family time interspersed <br/>\nthroughout the day, evening and on weekends.<br/>\n<br/>\nNATURAL MATH, in particular, seems to be a method by which to reduce the <br/>\namount of agony a child must endure to learn multiplication and geometry, <br/>\netc., by learning a few concepts and principles and then having that <br/>\ninformation available for the rest of their lives so that they can always <br/>\nquickly &quot;figure it out&quot;  for themselves, if and when they need to.  <br/>\nPrimarily, I&#39;m looking for the materials SO I CAN TEACH MYSELF the <br/>\nprinciples, then mentor my son as the opportunities present themselves in a <br/>\nmore natural way. I&#39;m anxious about math, as that&#39;s an area in which I&#39;ve <br/>\nalways felt deficient.<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan is slowly starting to develop some interests, again, and that is <br/>\ncertainly helping me focus some of my energies for his benefit. Having <br/>\nbrought home a Calvin & Hobbes comic book for my husband the other day, <br/>\nDylan snapped it up (not having any interest in reading ANYTHING since his <br/>\nPublic School experience), and he ready 24 pages the first night.  He looked <br/>\nahead to see how many pages there were, estimated how many days of reading <br/>\nhe had available to him, based on 24 pages a night, and read for only three <br/>\nmore nights before he refused to read anymore.  Apparently, he never wanted <br/>\nthe adventure to end, so he wouldn&#39;t read one more comic strip, let alone <br/>\none more page, until he had at least one more Calvin & Hobbes book in the <br/>\nhouse...Naturally, I see the beauty in this and have ordered a dozen more <br/>\nbooks, some of which we now have piled up on the living room floor, waiting <br/>\ntheir turn to be devoured by a happy young boy!<br/>\n<br/>\nTHANKS for your &quot;Favorites&quot;  list regarding math, and the heads up regarding <br/>\nThe Complete Homelearning Source Book, by Rebecca Rupp.  That is not one <br/>\nI&#39;ve come across, and it sounds wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo time to preview this before I send it, so I hope I have expressed myself <br/>\nin the way I&#39;ve intended...<br/>\n<br/>\nI APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR FEEDBACK AND HELPFUL HINTS, JOYCE!
