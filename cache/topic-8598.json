However, it gave up the <br/>\nidea because the panel thought 30 students or more are needed for them to <br/>\nlearn social rules. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe trial calculation by the ministry showed a 30-student class will <br/>\nrequire 120,000 more teachers and a budget increase of about a 1 trillion <br/>\nyen. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe panel also sought to review a long-standing idea that students of the <br/>\nclassroom always receive lessons together. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe panel said class size should be limited to about 20 students when <br/>\nteaching Japanese, arithmetic and science to elementary school students. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe panel also suggests the same number of students be taught in English <br/>\nlanguage, mathematics and science classes at junior high schools. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[copyright - Asahi  Shimbun, 2000]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8597,"nextTopicId":8600}}
