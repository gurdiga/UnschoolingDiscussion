They are buried all over the <br/>\ncity!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe loved them as pets and we had as many as five at a time. We kept them in <br/>\nan aquarium with the small brown pebbles for the bottom. We sloped one side <br/>\nand had a little pond for them in there also. So they could go into the <br/>\nshallow water and come out with ease. We fed them from a bottle cap. We did <br/>\nhave the hermit crab food that does indeed last forever. We would also give <br/>\ntiny scraps of people food too. And they just love peanut butter. I loved to <br/>\njust watch them eat that when we gave it to them. We had various ones for <br/>\nshort and also long periods of time. When one might crawl out of his shell, <br/>\nyou need to put him on moist soil or sand, alone, and give him other larger <br/>\nshells to choose from for his new home. Unfortunately for us, they never <br/>\nmade it after that. It was so sad to see this poor little naked crab die. <br/>\nBut I have heard from others that they have been successful at this.

All <br/>\nwe do is keep their sponge wet and put a few drops of hermit crab <br/>\nfood in every day.  The first time we had hermit crabs they died.  <br/>\nThe place we bought them from had told us that they just need crumbs <br/>\nfrom people food so not to buy any special food.  This time we <br/>\nactually bought the hermit crab food (very cheap and one container <br/>\nlasts forever). I think it&#39;s the food that&#39;s keeping them alive, so I <br/>\nwould recommend it.   It&#39;s fun to get them out and put them on the <br/>\nsidewalk and watch them crawl.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust don&#39;t forget to put their lids back on their cages, or they&#39;ll <br/>\ncrawl out and disappear.  That happened to us--my daughter was very <br/>\nsad that our hermit crab was lost.  Then, we were at our homeopath&#39;s <br/>\nfor a visit, and I had brought a big basket of Lincoln logs for them <br/>\nto play with during the appointment.  My daughter sat down to play <br/>\nwith the Lincoln logs and in a few minutes yelled, &quot;Hey, I found <br/>\nHermie!&quot;  lol  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, amycats2@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;   We became the proud owners of a hermit crab this weekend.
