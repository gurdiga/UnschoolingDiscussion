Some of our ex employees are very good friends <br/>\nstill (Jade and I just played pictionary with two of them last night) and <br/>\nmany of our new employees stay for an hour or so after work to socialize <br/>\nwith us and each other. We encourage eating together and open communication. <br/>\nI agree that their are people who I would have to be careful around in the <br/>\nsense that they are not very good employees and I need to be more <br/>\nauthoritarian but for the most part all of our employees do a great job.<br/>\nWhen I hire them it is made quite clear that I have no problem firing people <br/>\nfor not helping my business (I have fired a best friend, who is still a <br/>\nfriend, my sil, and my nephew) and they know that no matter how much I like <br/>\nthem personally, I will fire them if they are not doing what needs to be <br/>\ndone.<br/>\nThe only line I feel I need to draw is what is for the best interest of the <br/>\nbusiness.<br/>\nbtw My long term employee would tell me what needs to be done if I wasn&#39;t <br/>\npulling my weight and expect that I take care of it just like I would do to <br/>\nthem. They give me ideas for improving my business that I wouldn&#39;t have come <br/>\nup with myself and my business wouldn&#39;t be as great as it is today without <br/>\nthe relationships that I have built with the people who work with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my different perspective on relationships in business from my personal <br/>\nexperience.<br/>\n<br/>\nVelvet</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102843,"nextTopicId":102917}}
