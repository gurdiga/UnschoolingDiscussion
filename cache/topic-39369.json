Often children don&#39;t know enough to<br/>\n&gt;be able to ask questions.  I have no hesitation asking questions to<br/>\n&gt;stimulate a particular line of thought. A good one is, &quot;Why do you think<br/>\n&gt;that happened?&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;He likes math and science and these higher functions are going to be<br/>\n&gt;important to be able to &gt;manipulate the concepts that he already<br/>\n&gt;understands.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If, in fact, it is true that he will need &quot;these higher functions&quot; isn&#39;t it<br/>\n&gt;better that the understanding be a natural outcome of his exploration and<br/>\n&gt;desire to manipulate the concepts rather than abstract concepts learned<br/>\n&gt;because some book says you ought to know it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have serious doubts about the value of learning much of the higher math<br/>\n&gt;amongst other things taught in school.  If I or my husband, who is an<br/>\n&gt;engineer, cannot demonstrate to our daughter how we use a particular<br/>\n&gt;mathematical concept we are uncomfortable about insisting she learn it.  We<br/>\n&gt;are confident that should she need to demonstrate her knowledge of math<br/>\n&gt;concepts or anything else in order to obtain entry to university, she will<br/>\n&gt;be motivated to study them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;None of us know exactly what academic skills our children are going to need<br/>\n&gt;to be employable. Possibly up to 50% of the potential jobs have yet to be<br/>\n&gt;invented.  There is no way you can possibly cover all possibilities.<br/>\n&gt;Schools do not have any &quot;inside knowledge&quot; on what children need to know.<br/>\n&gt;Just because school tries to teach particular concepts does not<br/>\n&gt;automatically mean the information is worth knowing. Keep in mind that we<br/>\n&gt;all have gaps in our knowledge and spend all our lives filling in the holes<br/>\n&gt;we consider useful to fill.  Unschooling is a wonderful way to encourage<br/>\n&gt;children to have confidence in their ability to fill of those holes at any<br/>\n&gt;time in their life without having to rely on someone else teaching them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Trust in your ability to guide your children.  You know what basic skills we<br/>\n&gt;all require to function effectively as adults in our society.  Children tend<br/>\n&gt;to learn most of it through a desire to imitate the adults around them.<br/>\n&gt;Make an effort to surround your family with interesting people and<br/>\n&gt;activities, punctuated liberally with time for reflection and learning just<br/>\n&gt;happens.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hugs,<br/>\n&gt;Cheryl<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_____________________________________________________<br/>\nSupercharge your e-mail with a 25MB Inbox, POP3 Access, No Ads<br/>\nand NoTaglines --&gt; LYCOS MAIL PLUS.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mail.lycos.com/brandPage.shtml?pageId=plus\">http://www.mail.lycos.com/brandPage.shtml?pageId=plus</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":110304892,"authorName":"Louise Rynkewicz","from":"&quot;Louise Rynkewicz&quot; &lt;lrynkewicz@...&gt;","profile":"louiserr2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] vision therapy","postDate":"1027622112","msgId":39428,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJMT05BQ09MSUtMR0pBQUFAbWFpbGNpdHkuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39427,"nextInTopic":39436,"prevInTime":39427,"nextInTime":39429,"topicId":39369,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Debbie, I m interested in any info concerning this issue so I appreciate your input and will definately look up the links.

She started with, &quot;Well MY <br/>\ntheory is that ....&quot;. What I loved about it was that she didn&#39;t hesitate at <br/>\nall to include her own theories right there in with those of the scientists. <br/>\nAnd, in fact, her theories were excellent ones. One was that when the spiders <br/>\nspin their webs, they leave unsticky spots and that the spider has an <br/>\ninternal map that tells it where those nonsticky spots are so that it can <br/>\nwalk all over the web. Another was that it secretes just a little dab of an <br/>\noil or something in its feet as it walks, that reacts with its own threads <br/>\nand makes them not sticky.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - one thing I really like to do is find little interesting topics like <br/>\nthat, where scientists really do NOT have many answers, especially topics <br/>\nthat kids can really relate to. The reason the spider conversation came up <br/>\nwas because Joylyn was just sitting there and spider sort of dropped down on <br/>\nher out of a tree, suddenly, and she was showing it to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to remember to mention to Lexie (because she always likes these little <br/>\nanimal-related tidbits) that scientists think they&#39;ve discovered something <br/>\nabout how the Monarch butterflies know how to migrate thousands of miles <br/>\nevery year. They&#39;ve never really known - but now have evidence that they know <br/>\nwhich way to fly based on the location of the sun. And they came up with an <br/>\ningenious way to study the butterflies, too, by tethering them so that they <br/>\nthink they are going somewher, but really don&#39;t, and putting a little teensy <br/>\nsensor on them so they can keep track of which direction they are flying. <br/>\nHowever, they still don&#39;t know at all how the butterflies know how to go back <br/>\nto the same exact spots along the migration route. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-butterfly22jul22005042.s\">http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-butterfly22jul22005042.s</a><br/>\n<br/>\ntory?coll=la%2Dheadlines%2Dnation<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the article, you have to register on the LA Times site to see it - it <br/>\nis free to register.<br/>\n-<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":36193940,"authorName":"Lewis","from":"&quot;Lewis&quot; &lt;lapin@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] vision therapy at home","postDate":"1027610148","msgId":39410,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE1BQkJMUEVGQUNISklJQ0NCSU1HRUVORkRBQUEubGFwaW5Ab2x5cGVuLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEY0RWZoekwxZjZZa3duOVdndGMwMDAxY2M3YkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":39408,"nextInTopic":39411,"prevInTime":39409,"nextInTime":39411,"topicId":39369,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We see a Vision Therapist that happens to be a 3 hour drive and ferry ride away.

It cannot be forced.

To do that, you <br/>\nneed to stop thinking in terms of school subjects at all, and start <br/>\nthinking in terms of what will help your son explore the things he&#39;s <br/>\ninterested in.  If he&#39;s really interested in science and math, he&#39;s going <br/>\nto be asking questions about those things.  You can help him go from one <br/>\nquestion to the next and show him how they all connect.  If he really needs <br/>\ncalculus and physics, etc. to do what he wants to do, then you can help him <br/>\nfind ways to learn those things.  But start with where he is now and where <br/>\nhe wants to go now.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the reason I&#39;m jumping in here is that thinking in terms of school <br/>\nsubjects really got in the way of my own understanding of unschooling, and <br/>\nI started out thinking I was a radical unschooler.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nTia, who hopes that was both gentle and clear<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":110304892,"authorName":"Louise Rynkewicz","from":"&quot;Louise Rynkewicz&quot; &lt;lrynkewicz@...&gt;","profile":"louiserr2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Intro and math question","postDate":"1027541861","msgId":39369,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE9CRUxFSkxJRU9QTENFQUFAbWFpbGNpdHkuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39371,"prevInTime":39368,"nextInTime":39370,"topicId":39369,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everybody, I ve lurked enough and have thoroughly enjoyed the dialogue.

I took him out of school half way through 1st grade when he was showing signs of depression. He was unstimulated and frustrated. He has huge frustrations with reading and writing (we are looking into vision testing)but is conceptually advanced in most areas. The crunch came when the school principal refused to accept his giftedness and stated &quot;I will not rearrange MY school for your child&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been feeling our way through homeschooling ever since. I have now come to the conclusion that I have been trying to &quot;school&quot; too much. I need to find a way to get him excited about learning again. I will go along with any interests he has but he is not very self led. He seems to need quite alot of guidance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure that total &quot;unschooling&quot; is our destination but I know that finding the right balance for my son (and his siblings) IS my destination. I am also sure that a large degree of unschooling has got to be the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHence my plea to everyone out there! With all your experiences I hoping you can give me some guidance. I&#39;m someone who likes to see something produced on paper (workbooks look great to me although I&#39;ve never considered using a curriculum - he may as well be in school!!) but I know they are not for him. I want to inspire him again. I can see ways and means of unschooling most subjects (art, history, science,geography etc)since it seems to me that they are things we talk about and do as a family anyway. You&#39;ve probably guessed my problem; MATH. I can see introducing concepts while cooking and crafting and in general everyday life but how do you unschool the formulas for calculating the circumference of a circle, Pythagoras and higher Trig functions, calculus, physics functions etc? Do I just have to leave this until he picks them up himself - I think I&#39;m scared to do that. He likes math and science and these higher functions  are going to be important to be able to manipulate the<br/>\n concepts that he already understands.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate any help. Please be gentle with me, I&#39;m new to this ;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening,<br/>\nLouise  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________<br/>\nSupercharge your e-mail with a 25MB Inbox, POP3 Access, No Ads<br/>\nand NoTaglines --&gt; LYCOS MAIL PLUS.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mail.lycos.com/brandPage.shtml?pageId=plus\">http://www.mail.lycos.com/brandPage.shtml?pageId=plus</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25800,"nextTopicId":40011}}
