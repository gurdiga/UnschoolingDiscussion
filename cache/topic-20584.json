I designed my own program, <br/>\nfound my own resources, had a committee to review my work with me. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n     Does anyone know of a comprehensive list of these kinds of colleges?  I <br/>\nknow Goddard in Vermont has this kind of thing and there is another college <br/>\nnear them that is similar.  I would like to know about all of the colleges <br/>\nlike this and their programs.  <br/>\n      Lucy&gt;&gt;<br/>\nLucy--when I did this--in the late 70&#39;s, I checked out the Union of Experimenting Colleges and Universities, in OH. I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re still around.  I looked into several colleges--some that I remember are Friends&#39; World College, Bard College, SkidmoreCollege, Roger Williams College. I wonder if Antioch College inYellow Springs might have resources?<br/>\nYou might try a search on alternative education.<br/>\nI started with the UECU, but they merged with Capital University in Columbus, OH ,and I opted to go with Capital. (at the time their accreditation seemed important?????) I do know that many colleges are tapping into the adult learner market and that hey have developed external or adult degree programs.<br/>\n Taking control of my own education was and is empowering. What I did was relevant to me and incredibly interesting!!!<br/>\n Debra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20308,"nextTopicId":20586}}
