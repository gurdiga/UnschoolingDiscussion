There are a few &quot;logistical&quot; challanges though.. For <br/>\none thing, I also have to get up fairly early... 7am, to take Landon to <br/>\nschool.   So, when it gets on past midnight, I just cant stay awake.  Also, <br/>\nDh is not too keen on &quot;not&quot; having me in bed with him...we get very little <br/>\ntime alone..  Not just for sex, just for &quot;being together&quot;.   The other( <br/>\nbigger) problem is that the kids bedroom is adjacent to ours.  Thier TV and <br/>\ngame systems are in there.. THATS what they want to do.   The TV downstairs <br/>\nis broken ( Ethan broke the on/off switch), so theres really  nothing for <br/>\nthem to do downstairs ( that they want to do)     I&#39;ve suggested me reading <br/>\nto them, playing cards or board games, etc.. No, they want to either watch TV <br/>\nor more often, play games.    That would be OK.. but even my presence and <br/>\ninteraction does not keep them quiet enough for Dh to sleep .     I suggested <br/>\nmoving thier TV&#39;/system downstairs,  but they would much rather have it in <br/>\nthier rooms... Taking it back and forth every night is too much trouble.. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome folks suggested that since the kids are not respecting thier dads need <br/>\nto sleep, then go ahead and have then turn the stuff off at 10.   Thats what <br/>\nwe&#39;ve been doing.   They can play, but when they start getting loud, its has <br/>\nto go off..  Then they lie in bed and fuss and argue and expend the rest of <br/>\ntheir high energy for another hour or so.   JP usually bed hops several times <br/>\nbefore he gets settled.   See, the thing is.. before we started <br/>\nhomeschooling, I got them up at 7am.  Then with thier long, busy ( stressful) <br/>\ndays of school, they were ready to go to sleep by 10.   Actually, we never <br/>\nhad a bedtime rule before when they went to school.   Thier being asleep by <br/>\n10 was a natural occurence because of thier schedules.  Well, they stopped <br/>\ngoing to school, I dont get them up in the mornings, they sleep sometimes til <br/>\n11 am.. so, of course, they are not sleepy by 10 pm at night.   The few days <br/>\nthat we have had early activities, it was HELL getting them up ( the boys <br/>\nthat is).. These were fun things they wanted to do, but they were just so <br/>\ntired.   And an occasional early morning have to get up disruption in thier <br/>\nsleep pattern has not helped alter it back to earlier to bed, earlier to <br/>\nrise.    I will say, they ARE getting better.. But, I think its because they <br/>\nnow know that if they start getting too loud, the stuff goes off.   I know <br/>\nthat is not unschooling, but it&#39;s been the only solution that has &quot;semi&quot; <br/>\nworked.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59223,"nextTopicId":59191}}
