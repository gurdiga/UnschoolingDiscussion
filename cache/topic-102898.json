Are there any other options besides<br/>\nlogging hours as far as meeting the requirements for homeschooling in your<br/>\nstate?  Options that would be less invasive?  Also, could you figure out<br/>\nwhat subjects the things he does (games) cover and log them without his<br/>\ninput.  Is there any reading in Halo 2, any historical stuff, any math?  If<br/>\nthere is, you can just put it under all three.  How detailed does your log<br/>\nneed to be.  Could you just write  &quot;covered history from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.&quot;<br/>\nAre you sure about how detailed you have to be?  From what I&#39;ve read, hslda<br/>\nis big on scare tactics.

Some people do realize that<br/>\nlearning happens all the time and not just with a curriculum.  Have you<br/>\nasked on a local list if there are any teacher/reviews available who support<br/>\nunschooling?

All coming from his knowledge that he acquired from playing Halo and Halo 2.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nThe whole artillery thing and weapons knowledge.   Alec, ds, was telling me all about  the different guns and vehicles that he uses and asking me questions.  Well,, I don&#39;t know anything about them.  We googled, we researched,  I learned a lot, he already knew most of what we found.  But I couldn&#39;t really answer some of his questions.   Really technical ones that were too hard to google.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nChristmas was approaching and we were going to be seeing my mom and dad, so I told Alec that he should tell Grandpa about Halo 2 and that he would probably get into talking about the weapons and stuff.  That he would probably know the answers to some of his questions.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was so cool.  First Alec was asking my dad if there were certain kinds of machine guns, then certain kinds of tanks,  then they got on to the mechanics of machine guns,, I think there were was steam operated ones, if I heard that right.   The conversation was very technical and over my head. &lt;g&gt;  Also the mechanics of tanks, the hydraulics systems of them. lol<br/>\n <br/>\nThey talked about my dad&#39;s time in Korea.  My dad&#39;s duties,, his training.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was an amazing connection for grandson and grandpa.  They touched on WW1, WW2,  and the Korean War.  So, Halo 2 can cover your history, science and math requirements.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nI can&#39;t say how much it means to your child to just support what they are doing.  Like Kelly said give a Halo2 party!  Equally, I can&#39;t say how much they do learn from those games.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAh, games,  if only people would give them the credit they deserve.  If my son&#39;s head was in a book or if he was researching some biological function of some animal, people wouldn&#39;t ask,  &quot;how long has he been doing that?&quot;  But since its a game, its not quite right that he&#39;s doing this so indepthly.    I find his passion amazing and incredible.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nFaith,  its great that you&#39;ll be able to come to the conference.  Its a life changing event!  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd there  will be lots of Halo loving people there that your son can talk with!<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~<br/>\n <br/>\nKiddos~Alec(11), Abbi(10), and Kyra(7)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!

He could listen to the presenters (which intrigued my son, Cameron) as well as hang around the teens and do *fun* things----fun things that *count* as learning. He could see that learning isn&#39;t painful----it&#39;s what we DO.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease consider it. Many folks make this their family&#39;s vacation.

You must feel <br/>\nvery proud you have such bright children that know a BAD thing when <br/>\nthey see it!  My 13 yr old son NEVER wants to go to school after having <br/>\nspent time there thru 4th grade.  Three years later he still doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike the thought of anything having to do with the word &quot;learn&quot;.  He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to learn about anything, which makes it difficult to log <br/>\nany hours.  I feel very sad for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know that I would have been so calm as you if a total stranger <br/>\ngrabbed my son&#39;s arm.  I probably would have opened my big mouth and <br/>\nhave gotten us all in trouble!  : )<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">      On Saturday, January 29, 2005, at 11:22 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DDecoeur@...\">DDecoeur@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We went to a local High school for a MOIS (Michigan Occupational<br/>\n&gt; Investigation)  It is only offered through school Id... anyway they <br/>\n&gt; let us  go to their<br/>\n&gt; Library to take the test... a test that has similar test<br/>\n&gt;  available on the Internet. for free but we went with the 4 H and  <br/>\n&gt; thought it<br/>\n&gt; might add more<br/>\n&gt; anyway we entered the school and my son was wearing a zipper sweat <br/>\n&gt; shirt<br/>\n&gt; with a hood.  We were in the building about 20 sec when some lady <br/>\n&gt; walked by  and<br/>\n&gt; said to him we don&#39;t allow hats in this school... he looked at her and<br/>\n&gt; nodded.... she brushed her head and said take it off... again he <br/>\n&gt; looked at her  and<br/>\n&gt; nodded... acknowledging her and started to walk down the hall...she <br/>\n&gt; reached<br/>\n&gt; out and grabbed his arm and said I mean you... he looked at me.

I said I think she wants you to take off your hood.   so <br/>\n&gt; he did.<br/>\n&gt; We continued down the hall.... keep in mind we weren&#39;t sure  where we <br/>\n&gt; were<br/>\n&gt; going and were looking for the office at this time.... and we  live in <br/>\n&gt; Northern<br/>\n&gt; Michigan where it is darn cold out.  The next person  we ran into said <br/>\n&gt; We<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t allow zipped coats in this school.... okay now  this is just <br/>\n&gt; ridiculous but<br/>\n&gt; being the polite boy he is he un zippers his  sweat shirt... at this <br/>\n&gt; time I<br/>\n&gt; lean over and stage whisper so this women could  hear... Next thing <br/>\n&gt; you know<br/>\n&gt; they will want you to turn your coat inside out....  it had a skull <br/>\n&gt; like thing on<br/>\n&gt; it...  he leans back and says then I  am leaving this joint and <br/>\n&gt; waiting in<br/>\n&gt; the car....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i should have left at this point but it was a 4H thing and I felt like <br/>\n&gt;  being<br/>\n&gt; polite and my kids being the  nice people they are were willing to  <br/>\n&gt; put up<br/>\n&gt; with this....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; so we get to the computers and the councilor sets us up.... first she <br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; taking them step by step until she realizes they can run a computer <br/>\n&gt; with out her<br/>\n&gt; help.  Well then a buzzer goes off that just about makes my daughter <br/>\n&gt; jump<br/>\n&gt; out of her chair.... she whips around and says to me &quot;what was <br/>\n&gt; that?/?&quot;  I  said<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I think that was the signal that class is done&quot;.  &quot;They have to be  <br/>\n&gt; told<br/>\n&gt; when a subject is done?&quot; she says.
