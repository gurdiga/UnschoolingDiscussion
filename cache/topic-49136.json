I told her some of the people would be easier to deliver to <br/>\nduring the day. She took her brother along so he could take some orders for <br/>\npopcorn. I wasn&#39;t too sure, but thought what the hey! They just came back <br/>\nwith pink cheeks and out of breath. Most people on our block know the kids <br/>\nare at home. One lady asked the kids why they weren&#39;t in school. Moly is <br/>\ntelling me that Jack told the woman that &quot;My Mom doesn&#39;t believe in school. <br/>\nShe wants us to grow up smart and happy.&quot; So then she said &quot;Oh, you&#39;re <br/>\nhomeschooled!&quot; Jack said, &quot;No, we don&#39;t do that either.&quot; Moly said she didn&#39;t <br/>\nask anything else. But she did pay Moly for her candy order and took an order <br/>\nfor popcorn from Jack. So that was nice. I can just hear her talking to her <br/>\nneighbor about those kids down the block! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMost times my kids tell people we unschool and since most people around here <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what they are talking about, they don&#39;t say much. Once a woman <br/>\nasked what grade Moly would be in, and Moly told her we don&#39;t do grades. The <br/>\nwoman wanted to know how Moly knew how well she was doing. Moly said &quot;Well, <br/>\nmy Mom, Dad, Grandma and Grandpa Edds, Uncle Will and Aunt Renee&#39; tell me I <br/>\nam really smart, so I guess I do just fine.&quot; (Good girl!)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523757,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"Pam Hartley &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pdhartley2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Need Clever answer","postDate":"1036429229","msgId":49136,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBINTIwMDcwTTlXVFlEQG10YTYuc25mYzIxLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":49137,"prevInTime":49135,"nextInTime":49137,"topicId":49136,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
