I am telling my child that his choices don&#39;t impact his life. I am saying that my ideas of <br/>\nhow he ought to live will override his laziness or boredom or loss of interest.

Monday is an adult <br/>\nclass, long and arduous.   Tuesday he teaches a beginning class at 4:00, takes <br/>\nthe advanced kid-class at 5:00, and then is in an adult weapons class for two <br/>\nhours (and it sometimes goes past 8:00).<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week he missed the Monday class to go out to dinner with friends.  While <br/>\nhe was gone, Keith told me he had said &quot;sick&quot; to BOTH nights the week before <br/>\n(I had been in Chicago).   So Tuesday I asked him if he was going, and he said <br/>\nyes, but he wasn&#39;t into it and wanted to take a break from it for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nME, the mom, invested in wanting to say &quot;my son has a black belt in karate&quot; <br/>\nwanted to say something about that, but I kept quiet about it. (He has a brown <br/>\nbelt.)  I lightly reminded him of the cost, but acknolwedged it was his money <br/>\nthis time (tax return was put toward that).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said he was going to talk to his sensei and not stay for the later classes <br/>\nafter he taught.  I talked to Keith (his dad) about it and said I didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto press him because then it would be about me, and if he went he would feel <br/>\nhe had lost a battle of wills with me.  Keith totally agreed.  I was wishing I <br/>\nhad said even less than I had.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a singing practice here and I didn&#39;t think about him for hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe came bounding up the stairs about 9:00, all energized, and said he had de<br/>\ncided NOT to quit.   He had stayed until the extra-long weapons session had <br/>\nended.   I asked whether it was just that he had a good time.  He said, &quot;There <br/>\nwere about 12 of my students there, and I saw them, and I just...&quot;  and he acted <br/>\nout going all soft and mushy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he was unwilling to abandon his fan club, basically.   Those younger kids <br/>\nreally like him, and he remembers being young there and going in large part <br/>\njust because of older kids who ran the drills.   All of those three he used to <br/>\nlove to impress and hang out with quit the dojo for high school considerations <br/>\n(sports or academics) before they were 18 (one at 17, two at 15).  He was sad <br/>\nevery time.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday he made other plans instead of the adult class.  <br/>\nToday he&#39;s definitely planning to go for the whole time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout working out in a more spread-out fashion (for years he went Tuesdays <br/>\nand Thursdays), that is a very long four hours.  But he knows that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had nagged and shamed him, he couldn&#39;t have joyfully decided to keep <br/>\ngoing.  And he probably will NOT go forever.  But I want him to go because he <br/>\nwants to and quit when he wants to, without being a factor if possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSunday he ditched work.  He called in sick (which he only slightly was) and <br/>\nthen went to hang around with friends.  I squawked a little about it when he <br/>\ntold us what the deal was. Sunday is NOT his regular work day, though, and he <br/>\nwas in as backup on the regular Sunday guy so it wasn&#39;t a very big deal.  It was <br/>\nsmall, but he got a call and they needed something, so I had to be honest <br/>\nthat he wasn&#39;t home, and I did track him down and he called them within five <br/>\nminutes, and he wasn&#39;t in trouble.   But I was cranky/bitchy-mom when I had called <br/>\nhim, and later when he was home I apologized.  I told him that when I was his <br/>\nage I was ditching classes to hang around with friends and I totally <br/>\nunderstood how he felt.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I thought and didn&#39;t say was that when I was his age I was doing MUCH <br/>\nworse and more dangerous things and was in places where my mom couldn&#39;t possibly <br/>\nhave tracked me down, and when I did have a job it was some pissant little <br/>\non-campus student job.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of that was said.  But I knew inside me that he has now ditched work <br/>\nONCE (one time, count it) in four years and two months of holding the same job, a <br/>\nreal job with keys and security system and cash register.  Not dipping oat <br/>\nmeal in the cafeteria or filing cardfor the bursar.  Not just ONCE saying<br/>\nZ &quot;sick&quot; about teaching a karate class he&#39;s not paid for teaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis life is more real than mine. He&#39;s more responsible than I was.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStill, the momly urge is for me to rattle on about responsibility and <br/>\nwhat-ifs, and I feel good when I can control that urge.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99966,"nextTopicId":99912}}
