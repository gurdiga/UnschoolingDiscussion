I have a mobile like this:  A cardboard <br/>\nbanner that says,&quot;The solar system&quot;--This has a hole punched at the top and <br/>\nhangs from the ceiling;  underneath it is a oval shaped piece with part of <br/>\nthe sun on the left side, and the rest of the oval is black with orbit lines <br/>\ndrawn for each  planet.  These pieces are  attached to the banner above it by <br/>\npunching holes and tying them;  underneath this are the planets in order.  <br/>\nEach one is painted, has a hole punched at the top, and is tied to the orbit  <br/>\npathway line it corresponds to.  The whole mobile is about 3 1/2 feet long, <br/>\nand looks  nice hanging.  It is something that will not be overly time <br/>\nconsuming ( which is good for young kids), and is inexpensive, too.  It is <br/>\nalso very lightweight, and easy to hang.    One other fun thing my kids got <br/>\ninto was making cardboard tube rockets.  We covered them with foil, and <br/>\nstuffed yellow and orange tissue paper in the bottom for fire, and added a <br/>\npaper cone on the top.  We used Pringles chips cans to make &quot;telescopes&quot;.  If <br/>\nyou are interested, hammer a nail hole in the  bottom of the empty can.  <br/>\ntrace the lid on black paper, and cut out the circle.  Take a straight pin, <br/>\nand push holes in the paper.  Put it into the lid, and put the lid onto the <br/>\ncan.  Look through the hole at the bottom of the can, holding it up by a <br/>\nwindow or other light source, and you will see &quot;stars in the night sky&quot;.  <br/>\nHope you and your little ones have fun learning about the planets.  ~Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Olivia","from":"Olivia &lt;liv2learn@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Bixz0UduI_GTYUXlpZdTsoh2GHE79BmBSc4cQTANM51JtlArDMg_7qzwYqlsqL2zdC4orQ6XNa30zFj8ZC5ujHgIow","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Solar System","postDate":"964454704","msgId":11518,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQuMS4yMDAwMDcyNDExMjU1Ny4wMDkyODM4MEBwb3AubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDk2NDQzMzg4My4yNTc5QGVncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11516,"nextInTopic":11526,"prevInTime":11517,"nextInTime":11519,"topicId":11495,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We got a great book from the library (and eventually bought it through Amazon.com) called Sticky Fingers: Space by Ting and Neil Morris (published by Franklin","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1720385303\">We got a great book from the library (and eventually bought it through<br/>\nAmazon.com) called Sticky Fingers: Space by Ting and Neil Morris (published<br/>\nby Franklin Watts).

An idea occurred to me to make a \n  model of the solar system and hang it from the ceiling. The idea was to use \n  balloons and paper mache to make the solar system and then paint them and hang \n  them from the ceiling in our learning room. Has anyone done this and if so do \n  you have any suggestions as to the best way to go about this. Oh, of course we \n  will talk about each of the planets as we are making them, and the sun too. \n  Also, if anyone knows of any good sites on the solar system with activies \n  geered toward 3 and 5 year olds I would also appreciate that info. I have \n  looked on the net but so far I can only find things for older \n  children.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Corallyn</font></div><tt>Message boards, timely articles, a \n  free newsletter and more!<br>Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br><br>Addresses:<br>Post \n  message: Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com<br>Unsubscribe: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br>List owner: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com<br>List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br></tt><br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11537,"nextTopicId":11519}}
