It was right after Sept. 11 and the reporter asked me NOTHING about whether or not I think more ppl were deciding to homeschool as a result of the tragedy.  Well, I watch it on the news a few days later and their &quot;expert&quot; trashed homeschooling and safety up and down...<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s quite funny because their expert was a school board member who had a fw months earlier contacted me and asked me to be on his advisory board, and we knew each other quite well.  When I was talking to the reporter I had no idea he would be on the other end, and when he was talking about the &quot;homeschooler&quot; he had no idea he was talking about me!<br/>\n <br/>\nPerhaps a newspaper article won&#39;t be so easy to twist around, but know that the reporter may use only half of a sentence, or place the sentences awkwardly so it seems to twist what you are saying.<br/>\n <br/>\nMeg<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli Traaseth &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kellitraas@...\">kellitraas@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nHey everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have somewhat of a quandary,,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a friend(Amy) whose roommate is a newspaper reporter.

Don&#39;t assume that someone who is giving you social cues of &quot;I get it&quot; actually gets it.  I went into the interview expecting that the reporter wanted to understand what I was saying and that if I wasn&#39;t clear  she would ask more questions or at least look puzzled.  But so far as I can tell, she was either formulating her next question while I was speaking or just nodding her head and looking as she were following the conversation in order to keep me talking.  I know that happens in ordinary conversation (I do it myself when I&#39;m more interested in the connection than whether I actually understand what the person is saying).  I just didn&#39;t expect to find that behavior in a reporter doing an interview.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that is just a warning that even if the interview seems to be going well, it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you&#39;ll like the article. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Should I be part of a newspaper article?","postDate":"1098705650","msgId":100818,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDI1MTIwMDUwLjI3MzE1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxMTA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNsaGg4bis0aDhqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":100817,"nextInTopic":100819,"prevInTime":100817,"nextInTime":100819,"topicId":100813,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**So basically, Kelli.
