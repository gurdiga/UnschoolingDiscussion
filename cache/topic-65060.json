My first three grandkids are being parented the I<br/>\nwould, only even better.  I&#39;m really hoping that my sons will choose<br/>\npartners who will want to parent in a similar way.

I&#39;m practicing now in how I say something when I<br/>\n*do* think Heather should look at a different way of doing things.  So far<br/>\n(and I think she agrees) I&#39;ve been able to get them to look at my ideas by<br/>\noffering my *suggestions* respectfully and with a &quot;try looking at it this<br/>\nway&quot; attitude.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary<br/>\nsaftety deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;  Ben Franklin<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65098,"nextTopicId":65140}}
