Re: Home Library<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| Earlier today my husband asked me to PLEASE take care of the<br/>\nbooks in the &quot;homeschool corner&quot; of the dining room. We have<br/>\nonly a small bookshelf, so there were many other books and<br/>\n&quot;school stuff&quot; piled on top, and I&#39;ll admit it was a rather<br/>\nprecarious mess.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| As I was sorting through trying to decide what to keep, what<br/>\nto toss, what to take to the Treasure Chest (at the local dump,<br/>\na place to put things in decent condition rather than just trash<br/>\nthem, all things are free-first come, first served) it hit<br/>\nme...why am I holding on to half the books we have? Some of them<br/>\nwere purchased as part of the Sonlight curriculum, and they are<br/>\ngood books. Some were purchased because they are classic<br/>\nchildren&#39;s stories, but most were second-hand. And they pretty<br/>\nmuch just sit on the shelf. There are a few favorites the<br/>\nLittles like to hear over and over and some that Sarah can read<br/>\non her own. Most of what she can read on her own are kept in her<br/>\nroom.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| My husband wants me to limit the amount of books we keep<br/>\nbecause of moving every so often and being restricted in weight<br/>\nto what the military will pay to move. One of his sort spots are<br/>\nthese books. He&#39;s not a reader, by the way. He&#39;d love the books<br/>\nto be more neatly confined, but keeps saying we don&#39;t have space<br/>\n for another bookcase whenever I bring up purchasing one..even<br/>\nanother small one that this one could rest on top of or<br/>\nsomething. Oh, and there are other books crammed onto the shelf<br/>\nof Sarah&#39;s room as well. Mostly books for when the kids are<br/>\nolder...classic literature mostly like Tom Sawyer, Jane Eyre.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Most of these books I&#39;m sure can be found at the library. A<br/>\ncouple do have very sentimental value as they were mine when I<br/>\nwas a child, but other than the cost of the books from<br/>\nSonlight...do I really need to hold on to them? Especially when<br/>\nwe often go to the library?<br/>\n|<br/>\n| I have these books because I think maybe the children will<br/>\nwant to read them sometime...but there is the possibility they<br/>\nmay never have much interest in them. Sarah struggles with<br/>\nreading right now and has never really been all that interested<br/>\nin being read to. Logan has a few books that he likes, but like<br/>\nSarah has other things to do. Megan however does really love to<br/>\nbe read to, and often brings me books to read to her.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Would you keep so many of these books or would you pass them<br/>\non in favor of letting the children just keep using the library<br/>\nfor their OWN tastes? I suppose I hope that by having the books<br/>\navailable they will be read...<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Paul constantly says there will be plenty of time for a family<br/>\nlibrary when he retires from the Coast Guard (another 10 years)<br/>\nand we have our own house and won&#39;t be moving so much.

Later on there could be interest and<br/>\nthen again maybe not. But they are there just in case. In your case, it<br/>\nsounds like there are other circumstances involved. I can understand the<br/>\nwhole idea of moving and weight and all. Plus if a lot of the books are from<br/>\npast &quot;home schooling&quot; it doesn&#39;t sound like there were picked with the kids<br/>\ninterest in mind. So I wouldn&#39;t feel bad about keeping them. If guilt gets<br/>\nyou, myabe put them on E bay and make some extra money. If it&#39;s no big deal,<br/>\ndonate them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe when you go through all those books you will find you have more to<br/>\ngive away then you thought. In that case, maybe you could add some new ones<br/>\nthat still wouldn&#39;t take up as much room. Ones the kids can go and pick out<br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone else mentioned half.com and about reselling books. Sounds like a<br/>\ngreat deal for someone in your situation. And there&#39;s always the library no<br/>\nmatter where you are. Tons of interesting and new stuff always there!!<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t sweat it, dump the schooly stuff and let the kids enjoy the ones they<br/>\nlike, no matter what books they are. My kids still really enjoy the small<br/>\nlittle kid books as well as older books. I haven&#39;t gotten rid of any baby<br/>\nbooks no matter how silly them seem.

We have only a small bookshelf, so there were many other books and &quot;school stuff&quot; piled on top, and I&#39;ll admit it was a rather precarious mess. <br/>\n <br/>\nAs I was sorting through trying to decide what to keep, what to toss, what to take to the Treasure Chest (at the local dump, a place to put things in decent condition rather than just trash them, all things are free-first come, first served) it hit me...why am I holding on to half the books we have? Some of them were purchased as part of the Sonlight curriculum, and they are good books. Some were purchased because they are classic children&#39;s stories, but most were second-hand. And they pretty much just sit on the shelf. There are a few favorites the Littles like to hear over and over and some that Sarah can read on her own. Most of what she can read on her own are kept in her room. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband wants me to limit the amount of books we keep because of moving every so often and being restricted in weight to what the military will pay to move.

Especially when we often go to the library? <br/>\n <br/>\nI have these books because I think maybe the children will want to read them sometime...but there is the possibility they may never have much interest in them. Sarah struggles with reading right now and has never really been all that interested in being read to. Logan has a few books that he likes, but like Sarah has other things to do. Megan however does really love to be read to, and often brings me books to read to her. <br/>\n <br/>\nWould you keep so many of these books or would you pass them on in favor of letting the children just keep using the library for their OWN tastes?
