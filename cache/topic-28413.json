Be sure to get the revised edition – though I haven’t","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-756121207\">Hi, Shari!<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone else has already mentioned Grace Llewellyns The Teenage Liberation<br/>\nHandbook. Be sure to get the revised edition  though I havent seen it, I<br/>\nve heard the changes are important. Id also recommend her second book, Real<br/>\nLives, in which unschooling teenagers describe how they spend their time.<br/>\nShe also organizes a summer Not Back to School Camp and another residential<br/>\nunprogram that runs during the school year. Theres a website  do a<br/>\nsearch on her name.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree (with whoever made this comment) that it might be helpful to point<br/>\nout to Gabe that college is a place he might want to go sometime, but not<br/>\nnecessarily, and that theres nothing magical about the age of 18. There was<br/>\nan article in the New York Times some months back about the fact that many<br/>\ncolleges, including some of the most selective ones, now prefer applicants<br/>\nwho have been out in the world doing something for a year or two, over those<br/>\nfresh out of high school. Ill try to find a link to that article for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne book that questions the need for college (or college right away) is<br/>\nThe Question Is College. Another book, The Sheepskin Psychosis (which may be<br/>\nout of print), gets deeply into the myths about college tuition being a good<br/>\ninvestment in purely financial terms. A book that might get Gabe thinking<br/>\nabout the fact that even adults with degrees are not necessarily satisfied<br/>\nwith their lives is Michael Foglers Unjobbing. If Gabe is concerned about<br/>\nmaking a living, have him try You Money Or Your Life, by Joe (?) Dominguez.<br/>\nThe voluntary simplicity and frugality movements (which have websites,<br/>\nand meetings all over the country) are good places to look for information<br/>\non living well on less, and thus being able to work at what you love. Check<br/>\nout the Tightwad Gazette books by Amy Dacyczyn (at least three volumes).<br/>\n.             .<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if Gabe wont be satisfied with anything less than an assurance that he<br/>\nwill be able to get into college if he does decide he wants to, there are<br/>\nseveral books on how homeschoolers get in. One is Judy Gelners College<br/>\nAdmissions: A Guide for Homeschoolers. Another is And What About College?,<br/>\nby David and Micki Colfax. (Three of the Colfax kids got into Harvard  the<br/>\nparents have also written two other books, Homeschooling for Excellence and<br/>\nHard Times in Paradise.) Holt Associates has a pamphlet titled Life After<br/>\nHomeschooling, excerpted from Growing Without Schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like Gabe is already critical of the school system. Build on<br/>\nthis - suggest he read John Holts books, beginning either with How Children<br/>\nFail (revised edition only!) or with Instead Of Education. John had a very<br/>\nstraightforward, accessible style, and wrote about what really goes on in<br/>\nthe classroom every day (and in the latter book, about what can go on<br/>\noutside of it).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the materials Im suggesting can be found by going to the Holt<br/>\nAssociates website at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.holt/gws.com\">http://www.holt/gws.com</a> . You may have to link from<br/>\nthere to F.U.N. Books, which is the company that recently bought out most of<br/>\nthe Holt Associates book business. (If you have trouble finding any of the<br/>\nthings Im recommending, please let me know because I recommend them all the<br/>\ntime.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIm just realizing that the most useful reference I can probably give you is<br/>\nto the Grown Homeschoolers category in the 2002 Directory, which is<br/>\ncontained in the last issue of the (very recently defunct) magazine, Growing<br/>\nWithout Schooling. Ive just looked at it  there are about seventy names<br/>\nlisted, all of grown homeschoolers who are now in college, working, or<br/>\notherwise out in the world, and all with contact information and a brief<br/>\ndescription of what theyre doing. They all agreed to be listed, in order to<br/>\nanswer questions and give advice. Again, go to the Holt Associates website<br/>\nto order it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love to brainstorm on possibilities for teens who are thinking about<br/>\nleaving school. Unfortunately, the last two times I did this, nothing came<br/>\nof it, as the kids were already 16, and in the end too worried about their<br/>\nfutures to make any big changes, rather than just going along with it for a<br/>\ncouple more years. One had parental support and the other didnt. With your<br/>\nsupport, and at his relatively young age, theres absolutely no doubt in my<br/>\nmind that if Gabe focuses on doing interesting things in the here and now,<br/>\nthe future will largely take care of itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you might ask him, since he seems very upset about it, just exactly what<br/>\nhe envisions when he thinks about what might happen to him if he didnt get<br/>\ninto college. Does he picture himself on the streets, begging? Or just stuck<br/>\nin a boring or low-wage job? Or unable to hold his own in social situations<br/>\n(marry the right girl, etc.)? Does the fact that you have custody, rather<br/>\nthan his parents, figure into it? Encourage him to be as specific as he can<br/>\nin talking to you about his fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe may be looking around at adults he knows and not wanting to end up like<br/>\nthem. Which adults are these? Maybe some of these unhappy or unfortunate<br/>\npeople actually have college degrees - and maybe the ones he assume do,<br/>\nactually dont. Maybe Gabe is worried about you  the work you do or dont<br/>\ndo, how much you earn, whether you are happy or whether you can support him<br/>\nand his brother. Its important to speak honestly about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople tend to assume I have a college degree, but I dont (I left after<br/>\nthree years to work for Holt Associates, John Holts organization). Among<br/>\nother things, Ive translated four books for major art book publishers;<br/>\nproofread the Spanish in a fifth book; worked as an interpreter in the court<br/>\nsystem in Spain; published a front-page article in the Education section of<br/>\nwhat was then Spains largest newspaper (El Pais); been on TV and radio in<br/>\nSpain (promoting unschooling); taught English to adults for nine years in<br/>\nSpain; and been asked to interview for a job teaching Spanish in the grade<br/>\nschool I went to as a kid in NY (I turned this down, of course!) Ive also<br/>\nbeen a naturalist-guide in a New York State Park (leading school groups<br/>\naround, for one thing) and have taught workshops in solar oven construction<br/>\nat that Park and at a City Park.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore all this, I traveled widely and had a lot of interesting experiences<br/>\ninvolving alternative play therapy for kids under stress (London), organic<br/>\nfarming (Maine), rock climbing (France and Spain), spelunking (France), and<br/>\nso on. Some of these things, I did while a teenager, when I should have<br/>\nbeen in school, or as a young adult, when I should have been finishing up<br/>\nmy degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe educational chronology is this: two years of normal high school; one<br/>\nyear with the Audubon Expedition Institute, which is a traveling school;<br/>\none year on my own at 16, though with occasional financial support from my<br/>\nparents, doing weird things like the organic farming apprenticeship and<br/>\nbeing a mothers helper, etc.; off to college at 17 through early<br/>\nadmissions. After the three years of college, I left and have hardly looked<br/>\nback. (Im thirty-five now, and busy with our two-year-old son and writing a<br/>\nbook on attachment parenting.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have known poverty, but it has never been because of the lack of a degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like Gabe might be at the age to do local volunteer work, if not<br/>\nto spend long periods away from home. This will give him a lot more<br/>\nconfidence than completing any distance learning course (though if he did<br/>\nwant to consider enrolling somewhere, Id recommend Clonlaras extremely<br/>\nflexible program, which can include as much volunteer work for grade<br/>\nschool/high school credit as you want).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf youre in this area (New York City), Id be happy to talk with Gabe or<br/>\nwith you. If youre not, why dont you post your general location? With<br/>\nseveral hundred people on this list, theres likely to be someone in your<br/>\narea who could help. Actually, it just so happens that I have a couple free<br/>\nphone cards I wouldnt mind using up, so if he wants to talk I could call<br/>\nhim, or I could call you. Sometimes it helps to have a real conversation,<br/>\nnot just an on-screen one. So email me your phone number and Ill call.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou indicated that Gabe is interested in things, and is reading books he<br/>\nloves. What things and books are these (if he doesnt mind your posting<br/>\nthis)? And what are the types of things hes definitely NOT interested in?<br/>\nBy thirteen a lot of kids have general leanings (hands-on, literary,<br/>\nartistic, natural science, etc.), if not defined interests. I wouldnt<br/>\npressure him to specialize, but it helps to know a little more. Why dont<br/>\nyou hand over the messages youve gotten so far to Gabe and ask him whether<br/>\nhe wants to post his own? There is nothing that says this has to be an<br/>\nadults-only forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you send me a mailing address, I can send you a copy of an article I<br/>\nwrote for a nationwide teaching magazine when I was 12, titled A Student<br/>\nSpeaks Out (I was paid $200 for it  maybe this fact would inspire him to do<br/>\nsome writing of his own). Im much more radical now than I was then, of<br/>\ncourse, but it could give Gabe another kids perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nElsa Haas<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ElsaHaas@...\">ElsaHaas@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Shari Watson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:swatson1@...\">swatson1@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, November 24, 2001 12:15 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] advice?<br/>\n<br/>\nHi everyone,<br/>\nI was wondering if maybe someone out there had advice regarding helping my<br/>\n13 yr old brother relax and let learning happen.<br/>\nI have custody of my two brothers, Gabe, 13, and Matt, 11. While they have<br/>\nboth been homeschooled for the last couple of years, this is our first time<br/>\nattempting unschooling. It is a learning process for all of us.<br/>\nMatt is starting to realize that everything he does is a learning activity,<br/>\nand is learning German, because he wants to, and reading books of his<br/>\nchoice. He is having a blast with the pressure to pass to the next grade<br/>\nlevel removed.<br/>\nGabe comes to me with tears in his eyes, saying, &quot;I feel like I&#39;m not DOING<br/>\nanything&quot; and &quot;What would an eight grader be learning right now?&quot; We have<br/>\nprovided him with things he shows interest in, and he IS reading books that<br/>\nhe loves. He is concerned he won&#39;t be able to get into college. He is<br/>\nworried that if he does manage to get in, that he will be unable to keep up<br/>\nintellectually with everyone else. He has seen the local public school<br/>\ncurriculum, and realizes that he is way ahead of where they say he should<br/>\nbe. (We live in a state that does not require testing.) He remembers public<br/>\nschool vividly, and does NOT want to go back, because he felt bored and<br/>\nunchallenged all the time.<br/>\nAre there any books we could read that might ease his fears? What else can I<br/>\ndo to help him feel ok about the learning he IS doing? I have never been a<br/>\nparent before, and I&#39;m just learning, too! :-)<br/>\nAny advice or suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nShari<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

While they have both been homeschooled for the last couple of years, this is our first time attempting unschooling. It is a learning process for all of us. <br/>\n Matt is starting to realize that everything he does is a learning activity, and is learning German, because he wants to, and reading books of his choice. He is having a blast with the pressure to pass to the next grade level removed.<br/>\n Gabe comes to me with tears in his eyes, saying, &quot;I feel like I&#39;m not DOING anything&quot; and &quot;What would an eight grader be learning right now?&quot; We have provided him with things he shows interest in, and he IS reading books that he loves. He is concerned he won&#39;t be able to get into college. He is worried that if he does manage to get in, that he will be unable to keep up intellectually with everyone else. He has seen the local public school curriculum, and realizes that he is way ahead of where they say he should be. (We live in a state that does not require testing.) He remembers public school vividly, and does NOT want to go back, because he felt bored and unchallenged all the time.    <br/>\n Are there any books we could read that might ease his fears? What else can I do to help him feel ok about the learning he IS doing? I have never been a parent before, and I&#39;m just learning, too! :-)<br/>\n Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nShari<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28337,"nextTopicId":28637}}
