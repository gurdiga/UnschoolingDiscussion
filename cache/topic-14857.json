Ideas??? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have.  Express the milk and wait.  If you don&#39;t need to save the milk, just <br/>\ntake a hot shower and spray it out on the wall and feel better.  Whether he&#39;s <br/>\nweaning or not, it will make YOU feel better.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience is that getting over being sick is different for each person <br/>\nand incident, and letting him go with his own instinct about what&#39;s good to <br/>\neat and what isn&#39;t is the best thing.  Maybe he&#39;s got gunk in his throat and <br/>\nneeds non-dairy/acidic stuff like juice until he&#39;s better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other suggestions remind me of something.   If you express and save and <br/>\nrefrigerate it, he might want to drink it.  Again, it might feel better on <br/>\nhis throat.<br/>\n<br/>\nSick doesn&#39;t count as a nursing strike, in my opinion (and that term seems so <br/>\nhostile and personal, anyway &lt;bwg&gt;).  Sick is just sick, and it needs to <br/>\npass.  But kids can go back to nursing after time passes, truly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14840,"nextTopicId":14858}}
