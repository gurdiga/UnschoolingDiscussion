My rule is that I <br/>\ndon&#39;t cook after dinner. If they really are hungery and they have had <br/>\na snack or didn&#39;t eat much at dinner then they can always have more <br/>\ndinner. Either way if they wait until bedtime to ask for something <br/>\nelse to eat they get more dinner or something that doesn&#39;t require me <br/>\nto prepare like a slice of cheese or ham or a piece of fruit.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hate to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; be that way so I try to ward it off, remind them to eat, give them <br/>\n&gt; lots of prep time to gear down for bed.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do the same thing but it doesn&#39;t always seem to work. Ultimately I <br/>\nleave the responsability on DS, the 5yo. I give him the choice and if <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t like what is offered then he doesn&#39;t have to eat but I <br/>\nalways make sure to offer him something reasonable. I guess I do the <br/>\nsame thing with 3yod also. If she tells me she is hungery then I will <br/>\noffer her something good to eat. If they really are hungery they will <br/>\nsit down and eat. If not they will start to play instead of eat or <br/>\njust won&#39;t accept the offer of food. If they choose to eat and play <br/>\ninstead then they don&#39;t get any more offers and then get in trouble <br/>\nthe next time they tell me they are hungery.<br/>\n<br/>\n Even still they don&#39;t have to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; go to sleep, but may lay quietly in bed reading/talking/playing with<br/>\n&gt; doll etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I tell mine the same thing. You don&#39;t have to go to sleep and you do <br/>\nhave to stay in your bed. You can read or play quietly, just stay in <br/>\nyour bed. Oh and another excuse they use is that they miss Daddy. I <br/>\nknow sometimes this is real, that they really can&#39;t sleep because <br/>\nthey miss him. I also know that sometimes they are just using it as <br/>\nan excuse to stay up and get some attention. DH is a police officer <br/>\nand usually I will offer them one of his uniform shirts to sleep in. <br/>\nThey like this and they have to stay in thier beds or it will get <br/>\ntaken away. I used to didn&#39;t use it as a privilage until they started <br/>\nusing it as an excuse to get out of bed. It is pretty easy to tell <br/>\nthe difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n So yes, I would say stick with the routinte.  (this is coming<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; from a very unscheduled, non regimented person too LOL).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kathy<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am also fairly unscheduled. DH thinks I need to be more structured <br/>\nin my HSing. But how do you unschool and provide a structure to your <br/>\nday? Usually, I ask the kids what they are going to do this morning, <br/>\nafter lunch, when we get home, after dinner, etc. I let them decide <br/>\nwhat the structure is. If there is something I need/want them to do <br/>\nthen I tell them they have to do &quot;this&quot; first and then they can do <br/>\nwhat they want. Also, if they start running wild in the house they <br/>\nget sent outside and have to stay out till they are ready to be calm. <br/>\nIf they complain that it is too hot, which it often is, then they can <br/>\nalways get in the wading pool or play in the water. If they choose <br/>\nnot to that is their choice, but if they decide to come in the house <br/>\nthey have to do something quiet/constructive, not just run and yell <br/>\nthrough the house. DH is usually asleep during the day, so this is <br/>\nimportant.
