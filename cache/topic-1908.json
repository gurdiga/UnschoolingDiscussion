There are lots of sites on vinegar here&#39;s one that<br/>\ntalks about a lot of different uses:  Vinegar<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the recipe I use, I just pour in a 1/2 cup of baking soda, let that<br/>\nsettle in and then pour in a 1/2 cup vinegar so that it bubbles. I let my dd<br/>\ndo the measuring and pouring so its not real exact. We have hard water<br/>\ndeposits so we let it bubble awhile and then she scrubs it with a brush and<br/>\nrepeats it as many times as she wants.
