He <br/>\ncould have hidden it, or spent it subtly, but he brought it in, showed it to <br/>\nme and said &quot;Look what I found.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Where?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In the road.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when he was telling the story, he didn&#39;t act or sound like he would have <br/>\nif he had found twenty dollars in the road.  He sounded calm, but kind of <br/>\nstunned, like he had surprised himself disturbingly.  (Hard to describe it--I <br/>\ncould say it the way he said it, but for one thing--he didn&#39;t look at me, he <br/>\nkept looking at the bill when he was telling me; it just was wrong.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI could have said &quot;Why are you acting so weird?&quot; but I didn&#39;t.  And I wasn&#39;t <br/>\nsure.  I said sometimes people do lose money, and my sister finds money all <br/>\nthe time, always has.  I told him if nobody claimed it in a day or two he <br/>\ncould keep it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe neighbor called after a few hours and I said yes, Kirby did have a $20 <br/>\nbill.  One had disappeared from her dresser.  So I talked to Kirby about it <br/>\nreally gently, and he admitted he had picked it up and hadn&#39;t known how to <br/>\nput it back, or what to do.  So we went back over, and she was very cool <br/>\nabout it, and so was Kirby.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat might have been the end of it, but when he was nine and had only been at <br/>\nhis dojo for a few months, the sensei called me and said some money was <br/>\nmissing from the dressing and did I think possibly Kirby had taken it.  I <br/>\nsaid I would love to say &quot;no,&quot; but there was this one prior incident.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And that all really taught Kirby the power of one serious failure to affect <br/>\npeople&#39;s future trust.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the teacher asked me not to mention it to Kirby, that they would look <br/>\nfurther and that he would ask him himself, and that if it turned out Kirby <br/>\ndid have it, they wouldn&#39;t put him out of the school or anything at all, but <br/>\nwould speak with him about honor and all that.  That was fine with me.  I <br/>\nfelt good having been honest and saying &quot;maybe.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I waited a rough whole day, kind of worried.  And I had looked subtly in <br/>\nKirby&#39;s stuff and there was no money, and he acted absolutely calmly normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day the teacher called and said the money had been found!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked to Kirby about it in a really neutral way, and he was relieved not <br/>\nto have been in a position to have to defend himself, but he did understand <br/>\nwhy I would say &quot;maybe.&quot;  It was great.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I give my kids lunch money they bring back the change.  They&#39;re very <br/>\nsweet about money, and because we trust them, we&#39;re more generous with it.  <br/>\nIf I don&#39;t have change, I can give Marty a $20 and tell him what he can use <br/>\nand what he can&#39;t, and I have always gotten change (and more than I expected, <br/>\noften).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"tonitoni@zfree.co.nz","from":"tonitoni@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"dYL2_PbvBTMKyycCfBcsHLDviOYaV9ifjCHf3BLqHWEu0Z6MitgQuFRFtUcWmDQRD5rII9815PkfmsE","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Lying, and a thank you","postDate":"986841361","msgId":18410,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlhc3ZlaCtlZWQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNBRDFCNDVELjI4ODMzLjVGRkMwMUBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+"},"prevInTopic":18409,"nextInTopic":18421,"prevInTime":18409,"nextInTime":18411,"topicId":18352,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe you could turn it around to something he could ...

Often what they are telling us is *what<br/>\nthey wish was true* and they tell it as if it was the truth. I&#39;ve really<br/>\nnoticed this with my 4 y.o. Mostly, I try to avoid situations that would<br/>\nmake a lie inevitable. If I come into a room with my kids and my youngest is<br/>\ncrying, I don&#39;t turn to my son and say &quot;What happened?&quot; Most likely the<br/>\nanswer will be something like &quot;She bumped her head on the wall&quot; (even though<br/>\nshe&#39;s sitting in the middle of the room). What I do is just come into the<br/>\nroom and say &quot;Asa is very hurt, do you need kisses Asa?&quot; and I&#39;ll pick her<br/>\nup and comfort her. At some point, my DS will often then either say &quot;Sorry<br/>\nAsa&quot; (so apparently he caused the tears) or he&#39;ll say &quot;I got really mad at<br/>\nher&quot; and I can help him process that emotion and talk about alternative<br/>\nactions.<br/>\nWhen something has happened (like for instance the toilet was overflowing)<br/>\nand I asked my DS what happened and he told me &quot;Nothing&quot;, I&#39;ve just<br/>\nemphasized to him that I need to know truly  what the problem is in order to<br/>\nfix it (in that case, turns out he flushed his underwear down the toilet).<br/>\nEventually, they will learn to tell the truth so that we can mutually solve<br/>\nthe problem. At this age, it&#39;s probably a hard thing for them to do. Kids<br/>\nare very smart about what will and will not frustrate their parents,<br/>\nregardless of whether we actively &quot;show disappointment&quot; or not. So often<br/>\nthey wish that the problem didn&#39;t happen or that they didn&#39;t cause it,<br/>\nbecause they know that it IS a problem. And this is what they say - their<br/>\nwish. Keeping that in mind makes it a lot easier to deal with effectively,<br/>\nIMHO :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n Blue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;My pants are outgrowing me&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) &quot;Potty pee!

The kid in that <br/>\nstory had a good reason to cry wolf--he was really lonely, being sent to work <br/>\nall by himself.  There could have been other solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if a kid complains too much about small hurts, it will be hard for <br/>\nparents to get excited about a large hurt.  If someone claims &quot;no money&quot; and <br/>\nis found to have some, &quot;no money&quot; will cease to mean anything.  (My husband <br/>\nearned that one from saying &quot;we&#39;re broke&quot; when we weren&#39;t, and now I don&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve him anymore about that--but we discussed it and he realizes he &quot;cried <br/>\nwolf,&quot; and so he is more specific now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThese things are all too much for a four year old.

And the second way might not be &quot;the <br/>\ntruth&quot; either at first, but with practice and real reasons (not &quot;consequeces&quot; <br/>\nmade up), and with understanding and sympathy, I bet he&#39;ll come around within <br/>\na couple of years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"BPpOFpbN94cXgWOYX0C4TxvlifF0CMq7_0yW33DK97ShGTGmvGbHPgkMhG_4iarp-smUr0ANkovPR4PEFUK5l0WMdYUnKP7CR_20gOLSfEEgsGgY4A","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Lying, and a thank you","postDate":"986818125","msgId":18368,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBRDFCNDVELjI4ODMzLjVGRkMwMUBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDlhcXBoMys0NDRnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18352,"nextInTopic":18369,"prevInTime":18367,"nextInTime":18369,"topicId":18352,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"\u000f My problem now, is about lying.\u000e 4yo ds lies to us a lot.\u000e I don t \u000f understand why.\u000e I lied all the time as a kid to try to keep from \u000f getting in trouble.\u000e","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2119400727\">My problem now, is about lying.\u000e 4yo ds lies to us a lot.\u000e I don&#39;t \u000f<br/>\nunderstand why.\u000e I lied all the time as a kid to try to keep from \u000f<br/>\ngetting in trouble.\u000e But since he never gets in trouble about \u000f<br/>\nanything, and we rarely show disappointment - then only briefly <br/>\n(like \u000f<br/>\nwhen he hits his sister), and he seems to be doing well.\u000e But still, \u000f<br/>\nhe lies to us, and then we do show disappointment.\u000e I just don&#39;t <br/>\nknow \u000f<br/>\nwhat to do.\u000e We have talked with him about it.\u000e DH told him that the \u000f<br/>\nonly time he will ever get in trouble is when he lies.\u000e I don&#39;t know \u000f<br/>\nabout that, but he seems to understand.\u000e For the moment anyway.\u000e <br/>\nNext \u000f<br/>\nthing we know, he&#39;s lying about something else.\u000e Suggestions?\u000e \u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\nMelanie in Indiana\u000f<br/>\n<br/>\nI read somewhere that it was a natural thing for children around that <br/>\nage to do, maybe mixing up real and not real, not sure abut that <br/>\nmyself...

Suggestions?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMelanie in Indiana<br/>\n-------------------------------------------<br/>\nFree long distance and international calls!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bigredwire.org/me/RefTrack?id=USA072984\">http://www.bigredwire.org/me/RefTrack?id=USA072984</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18453,"nextTopicId":18257}}
