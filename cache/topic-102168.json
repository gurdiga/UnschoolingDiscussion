My<br/>\nmom brought us out our lunch and snacks.  Our teeter totter was a really big<br/>\nplank on a log, which was set on a saw horse.  We used it for years and the<br/>\nplank was nice and long so you went really high.  Great memories!  I made<br/>\none for my kids once and they never got very interested in it.
