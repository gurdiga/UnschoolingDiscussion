Amber is an only child away up in the mountains.  A<br/>\nteacher comes for a while but can&#39;t handle the isolated life and leaves.<br/>\nThen another girl comes with her parents on a road-building crew.  She<br/>\ndecides to teach Amber to read and write.  Amber starts reading but hasn&#39;t<br/>\nstarted writing when Anna and her family leave.  Anna gives her the book,<br/>\nand Amber works at learning to write, finally writing Anna a letter and<br/>\ngetting one back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s still the idea of needing to be taught, but there&#39;s also the idea<br/>\nthat you can learn things on your own if you want to.  Anyway, it&#39;s a lovely<br/>\nstory, especially for a child who wants to read and write but is still<br/>\nstruggling with it.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary<br/>\nsaftety deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;  Ben Franklin<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62936,"nextTopicId":62925}}
