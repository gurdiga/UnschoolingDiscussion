The problem is that the choices for regular school are &quot;public&quot;<br/>\nor &quot;private&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur children are homeschooled (along with an estimated 1.5 million other<br/>\nchildren in the US - the number is uncertain because many states do not<br/>\ntrack the number of homeschoolers). This is definitely not public school,<br/>\nbut it also is not &quot;controlled and supported by a religious organization or<br/>\nother private group&quot; unless our family is considered a private group.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral calls to the help line listed on the form did not provide an answer.<br/>\nThey seemed to lean towards &quot;No School&quot; if it wasn&#39;t public or private, but<br/>\nbasically just kept repeating the definitions of what the options were.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould homeschooling be considered private school or should we write in a<br/>\nnew choice?<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly Greer in Maryland<br/>\n<br/>\n=======================<br/>\nHere is the explanation of the choices from your web site:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPart A. SCHOOL ATTENDANCE<br/>\nRegular School<br/>\nAdvances a person toward an elementary school certificate, a high school<br/>\ndiploma, or a college, university, or professional school (such as law or<br/>\nmedicine) degree. Nursery school and kindergarten are included. Tutoring or<br/>\ncorrespondence school should be counted only if credit for it can be<br/>\nobtained in a &quot;regular school.&quot;<br/>\nMay be public, parochial (church-related), or other private. Attendance can<br/>\nbe either by day or night, full time or part time. A school does not have to<br/>\nbe graded to qualify as a &quot;regular&quot; school.<br/>\nDo not include vocational, trade, or business schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nMark the &quot;No, has not attended since February 1&quot; box for people who were not<br/>\nenrolled in regular school. &quot;On-the-job-training&quot; is not school.<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic School<br/>\nA PUBLIC SCHOOL is any school which is controlled and supported primarily by<br/>\na local, county, state, or federal government. Mark the &quot;Yes, public school<br/>\nor public college&quot; box for people who have attended a regular school or<br/>\ncollege at any time from February 1, 2000 to April 1, 2000.<br/>\nPrivate School<br/>\nA PRIVATE SCHOOL is a parochial or other private school which is supported<br/>\nand controlled primarily by a religious organization or other private group.<br/>\nPrivate schools may be religious or nonreligious elementary schools,<br/>\nsecondary schools, colleges, universities, professional schools, nursery<br/>\nschools (including preschools and prekindergartens) or Montessori schools.<br/>\nMark the &quot;Yes, private school or private college&quot; box for people who have<br/>\nattended a regular school or college at any time from February 1, 2000 to<br/>\nApril 1, 2000.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo not assume that the name of the school indicates whether the school is<br/>\npublic or private. Also, payment of tuition at college does not indicate the<br/>\nschool is private.<br/>\n============================================<br/>\n<br/>\nNow here is the response I got:<br/>\n=================================<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a good one .... but the key to the answer is in the precise wording<br/>\nof<br/>\nthe questionaire, eg ... has this person attended *regular* school .....<br/>\nApparently the mask behind No 8 is to identify those that are in, how can I<br/>\nput<br/>\nit, an institutionalized educational setting, ie either a public or private<br/>\nschool.   Those selecting the no answer are considered to be in some other<br/>\nalternative setting.   The final tabulations for this table should give a<br/>\npretty<br/>\ngood idea on just what this number is, under the assumption that it is most<br/>\nlikely made of a majority in the homeschooling network.   By the way,<br/>\nproceed to<br/>\nNo 9 and mark what you consider the equivilant grade level to be based on<br/>\nyour<br/>\njudgement/experience.<br/>\n================================<br/>\n================================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the reply I got, it does appear that the expected selection for<br/>\nhomeschoolers is to select that the child is NOT attending school in<br/>\nquestion 8, but then to indicate the grade level in question 9. However, I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be surprised if submitting the same question several times resulted<br/>\nin different answers.

It looks like the Census could have provided some ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1336583504\">Everyone always complains that there aren&#39;t good statistics on the number of<br/>\nhomeschoolers in the US. It looks like the Census could have provided some<br/>\nfigures. Anyone else notice that on the long form (I have D2) you are asked<br/>\nif the person attended &quot;regular school&quot; and the choices are:<br/>\nNo, has not attended<br/>\nYes, public school<br/>\nYes, private school<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some states, homeschoolers are considered private schools, but in many<br/>\nothers they are not. Calls to the census help line just get me repeated<br/>\nreadings of the definitions and the suggestion that if it is not public<br/>\nschool or private school, then it must be no school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m waiting for a response to my written request for clarification. Actually<br/>\nI&#39;m sure &quot;Private school&quot; is the appropriate response - after all, what is<br/>\nmore private than a school for family members only? But I hope to make some<br/>\npeople think. Homeschooling doesn&#39;t exactly fall under &quot;supported and<br/>\ncontrolled primarily by a religious organization or other private group&quot;<br/>\nunless you want to consider the family a private group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve included the census definitions below:<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly<br/>\nwww.FUN-Books.com<br/>\nwww.unschooling.org<br/>\n<br/>\n=======================<br/>\nPart A.
