Right now I ask my children what they think they&#39;ll want to learn about for the year and use their ideas coupled with a few of my own to formulate the IHIP.  Quarterly reports are easy as I just mention a few of the things they&#39;ve done during the quarter.  Next year my oldest will be subjected to the whole testing situation.  I hate the thought of him being subjected to something so useless.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are the ages of your children?

Personally, I don&#39;t believe they ever really read the reports.  I was 2 mths. late on sending in a quarterly report once, because my mother in law was very sick, and all I received was a reminder notice.  When I did send in the report, I forgot to change the marking period # so they called me wondering what was going on.  I explained that I sent it in and through conversation, they realized they had it all along.  They were very nice the whole time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully it will stay that way, but you never know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you and your family well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\n<br/>\nRegina</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":147376218,"authorName":"liza sabater","from":"liza sabater &lt;listdiva@...&gt;","profile":"lm_sabater","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] NY State IHIP Question","postDate":"1074492397","msgId":89353,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE0MzhCRUQ0LTRBNDUtMTFEOC04QjRGLTAwMDM5M0I4NEZCNkBjdWx0dXJla2l0Y2hlbi5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDA1MUIxOTlFLjE0RkQ0NjMwLjNGRjY2MEJCQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":89349,"nextInTopic":89368,"prevInTime":89352,"nextInTime":89354,"topicId":89349,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
