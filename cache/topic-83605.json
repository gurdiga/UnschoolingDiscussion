How frustrating!!  He just got all these<br/>\ninteresting, colorful little packages all thrown together in a bag and now<br/>\nhe can&#39;t LOOK at it?!  So, I told her to let him look at the stuff and show<br/>\nher what he got, etc.  She reluctantly let him and guess what?  He looked it<br/>\nall over...showed everybody...ate HALF of a little candy bar and was done.<br/>\nMy sister is a very controlling person and she was quite amazed that he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t eat everything.  I explained to her that he didn&#39;t WANT to eat<br/>\neverything...he just wanted to see it!<br/>\nWhy are some moms so controlling?  I find it sooo frustrating.  With my<br/>\nsister, I could just butt in &lt;bg&gt; but with others, I just watch in dismay.<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\nWhy? Well, some people are just jerks, and want to control everything. Most <br/>\npeople aren&#39;t though. So...why?<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause they&#39;re scared and want to do what they think is best for their kids. <br/>\nCandy is bad for kids. It&#39;s important that kids get enough sleep, so they <br/>\nhave to have a bedtime. There are germs in that. Educating children is something <br/>\nprofessional do. Parents get controlling because they&#39;re afraid if they don&#39;t <br/>\nkeep things under control, Something Terrible Will Happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nFace it... you&#39;re presented with this little being who&#39;s all cute and <br/>\nvulnerable and you realize that suddenly you&#39;re in the Person-Making Business. That&#39;s <br/>\nwhy we read all the books. How the hell do you make a person????<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, even if you&#39;re in control, Something Terrible STILL might <br/>\nhappen. And when you let go of control, it really works out okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, try to be patient with those people. I believe it&#39;s much harder to BE <br/>\nthose people than to be around them. And you can keep helping your sister.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma2kids","from":"&quot;zenmomma2kids&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Halloween candy","postDate":"1067822659","msgId":83651,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJvNGFvMys5OHNoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwM2YwMWMzYTBkYiRmZmRmYjljMCQ2NTAyYThjMEAyMDAyZGVza3RvcD4="},"prevInTopic":83605,"nextInTopic":83684,"prevInTime":83650,"nextInTime":83652,"topicId":83605,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... yesterday evening after we got back from trick or treating and I walked past my 5 y.o. sitting with her basket of candy at the table and noticed that one","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-333755693\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt; One for the &quot;they&#39;ll never eat anything but junk&quot; people -- <br/>\n </span></blockquote>yesterday evening after we got back from trick or treating and I <br/>\nwalked past my 5 y.o. sitting with her basket of candy at the table <br/>\nand noticed that one of the first things she had eaten was the apple <br/>\nshe got from our next-door neighbor. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI love it. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got one for &quot;they&#39;ll never DO anything if you don&#39;t MAKE them.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nCasey (9) came back from trick or treating and immediately set out to <br/>\nsorting her candy.
