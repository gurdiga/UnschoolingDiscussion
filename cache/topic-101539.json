Let them work it out.<br/>\nAsk them to do something that&#39;ll make them gang up on you. Picking up toys or <br/>\nsome other much-hated chore should do the trick.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you could just stop listening in and worrying. You might be amazed to find <br/>\nthey work things out themselves.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Part 1:  Teach them to further hate picking up toys?<br/>\nInspire them to believe that picking toys up should only be done by those who <br/>\nare in trouble?  (I see county-jail inmates picking up trash in Albuquerque, <br/>\nbut that doesn&#39;t mean I should litter; people should pick up their own <br/>\npossessions because they WANT to, and they see value in it, not because they were <br/>\nbad.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut wait...<br/>\nTelling them to pick up toys isn&#39;t &quot;let them work it out.&quot;  There was no <br/>\nelaboration on &quot;Let them work it out.&quot;  Because it&#39;s a bad idea and can&#39;t be <br/>\nexplained away.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd find something so they will &quot;gang up on you&quot; seems by the nature of the <br/>\nway it&#39;s worded to encourage MORE negativity, and to accept that &quot;ganging up&quot; <br/>\nis an inevitable (and in this case desired) behavior.  NOT solutions.  Just <br/>\nways to make the overall situation worse in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that second part, the summary of the five items, &quot;Or you could just stop <br/>\nlistening in and worrying. You might be amazed to find <br/>\nthey work things out themselves.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nStop listening?<br/>\nStop listening to children?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could stop worrying if you NEVER stopped listening.  If you had always <br/>\nlistened and responded, there would be little to worry about.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might be amazed to find they work things out themselves, and wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nthat be convenient for the mom?  Wouldn&#39;t that make a mom who&#39;s willing to ignore <br/>\nher children feel better?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might be less amazed, and it would be more likely, to find that they had <br/>\nNOT worked things out themselves, but continued to yell, insult and hurt one <br/>\nanother for year after year, and go on to hurt others in the same ways unless <br/>\nas young children they are helped to learn better ways to interact.  And it&#39;s <br/>\npossible to help them do that as long as parents don&#39;t accept bad mainstream <br/>\nadvice and expect it to do anything other than help produce bad mainstream <br/>\nbehavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101504,"nextTopicId":101535}}
