We have a family of eight and a waiters job would<br/>\nbring in about enough to feed our family and buy necessaries, nevermind<br/>\nhousing and utilities. We refuse to put our children in daycare in order for<br/>\nme to work, and that would also leave homeschooling a very difficult thing.<br/>\nI agree the dad needs to be around and involved in the family. That is why<br/>\nwe are working on a business that would allow him more time with the family,<br/>\nbut there is some training required and some planning to be done in order<br/>\nfor it to be successful. As parents we also have an obligation to provide<br/>\nfor our children. We only own one car, and try to live simply. His job<br/>\ndecision was not so we could have the house on the hill and three cars in<br/>\nthe garage, it was so there would be food on the table and a solid roof over<br/>\nour heads. Sometimes to reach a place we want to be we have to go through<br/>\nplaces we don&#39;t want to stay and this is one of those places.
