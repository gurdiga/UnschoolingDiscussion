I don&#39;t know what I can<br/>\nexactly contribute except to put in my OWN experiences and views.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have already been on the range with real guns and real bullets. <br/>\nThis was when we lived in Texas and we&#39;re just now getting around to<br/>\npreparing them to go back again - probably the first weekend of next<br/>\nmonth because that will be the last time I can shoot before the baby<br/>\ncomes.  Now this is REAL guns and REAL bullets.  My kids, BTW are 5 and 7<br/>\n(the last time they went to the range they were 5 and 3).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have &quot;toy&quot; guns which they practice with.  Not only &quot;pointing and<br/>\nshooting&quot; but safety as well.  In this household there are two<br/>\nex-military men who intend (with my wholehearted approval) to teach the<br/>\nchildren about guns, knives and martial arts.  This will (in OUR opinion)<br/>\nteach them how to exercise self-discipline, self-control and safety.  Not<br/>\nonly how to safely handle a weapon, but how to be safe AROUND weapons. <br/>\nThis includes all of the above mentioned weapons -- guns, knives and<br/>\nhuman beings.  And it is my experienced opinion that the most dangerous<br/>\nweapon on this planet is the human being.  After all -- what creature<br/>\nwields the inanimate gun or knife?<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecifically the children will learn what guns and knives can do to not<br/>\nonly people but animals.  Especially guns.  They already know what a<br/>\nknife - specifically a scalpel - does to human beings.  They caught me<br/>\nviewing a page with graphics of a c-section in progress and were<br/>\nfascinated.  They are both section babies and their sister will be born<br/>\nthe same way in 3 weeks.  And scalpels are neat and efficient.  Not all<br/>\nknives are and NO gun is.  They also know a great deal about calibers and<br/>\nthe different degrees of damage they can cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome may say we are extremist in our own viewpoints, but the lives their<br/>\nparents have led makes us believe that it is crucial to their survival in<br/>\nthis day and age.  Our philosophy has always been &quot;If you don&#39;t like the<br/>\nway I live my life feel free not to live it that way.&quot;  This is simply<br/>\nhow WE unschool our children.  IMNSHO it is no better or worse to what<br/>\nthe collective YOU may choose to do so - it&#39;s simply different.<br/>\n<br/>\nPax,<br/>\nCrys<br/>\n<br/>\nDomus Ludus<br/>\nNon scholae sed vitae discimus<br/>\nOur newest student should arrive 5/7/04<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/cas_the_author/DomusLudus/\">http://www.geocities.com/cas_the_author/DomusLudus/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DomusLudus@...\">DomusLudus@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe best thing to hit the Internet in years - Juno SpeedBand!<br/>\nSurf the Web up to FIVE TIMES FASTER!<br/>\nOnly $14.95/ month - visit www.juno.com to sign up today!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92705,"nextTopicId":92656}}
