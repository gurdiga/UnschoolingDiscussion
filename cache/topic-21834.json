I rate myself as one","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1719944426\">Sandra,<br/>\n<br/>\nTell your friend that I enjoyed her writing style, but believe that she took<br/>\nthe Dinsmore stuff a little too far and seriously.  I rate myself as one of<br/>\nthose &quot;fundamentalists&quot; but don&#39;t see it as quite the curse some folks<br/>\nthink.  LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nLike much literature out there, there is both good and bad to it.  No piece<br/>\nof literature (aside from the Bible, which will bring a bring growl from<br/>\nsome of the crowd here) is ever held up as a &quot;perfect example&quot; by<br/>\nChristians.  Even the &quot;Chronicles of Narnia,&quot; another series enjoyed by many<br/>\nChristians, has its drawbacks and gray areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a matter of fact I was looking at a catalog I received in the mail today<br/>\nthat had a new study guide for the Dinsmore series (there&#39;s 28 volumes in<br/>\nthe series available in paperback or hardback). As with all the other study<br/>\nguides that I&#39;ve seen and/or used, I&#39;m sure there are questions that require<br/>\nthe child to compare/contrast today&#39;s understandings with the idealized<br/>\npresentation of the mid 1800&#39;s.  In fact, if the lessons on the Dinsmore<br/>\nseries are anything at all like most &quot;Christian&quot; curriculum, there will be<br/>\nlots of questions about right vs. wrong, personal accountability for<br/>\nbehaviors, was what was viewed as &quot;right&quot; then really right?, lots of open<br/>\nended questions requiring the child to think about their own understanding<br/>\nand opinions, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the affection that your friend refers to is prevelant in some families<br/>\nand not in others.  Its not necessarily a bad thing.  I still kiss my dad<br/>\n(gasp ... on the lips) and give him hugs and pets ... I love him.  I also<br/>\nkissed my grandfathers, uncles, and male cousins.  Nothing incestuous is<br/>\nmeant by it ... just call us a bunch of touchy-feely, southern hillbillies.<br/>\nI kiss my female relatives too.  Some families are just more inclined<br/>\ntowards physical affection ... the healthy kind ... than others.  And<br/>\nreferring to Elsie sitting on her dad&#39;s lap ... I still cuddle with my dad<br/>\non occassion ... but we both have put on a lot more weight than when I was a<br/>\nteenager and its not quite as easy to do with our diminshed laps LOL!  My<br/>\ndad had his first heart attack when he was 48 years old (high stress job and<br/>\nwas a smoker) and still isn&#39;t in the greatest of shape 11 years later ... I<br/>\nnever want to look back and think about a possible lack of affection between<br/>\nus because we held back just because someone had an icky imagination.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just my two cents from the other side of the fence &lt;grin&gt;.  Debate<br/>\ncan be a healthy thing, I just regret when labels get used that aren&#39;t<br/>\nstrictly true and might turn someone away from exploring a possible<br/>\ninterest.  But hey ... none of us are alike and she&#39;s entitled to her<br/>\nopinion, just sorry that she sees so much negativity and was probably hurt<br/>\nby a &quot;fundamentalist&quot; at some point to cause such a viewpoint.  Everyone,<br/>\nregardless of their religious affiliation, can step on people&#39;s toes ...<br/>\nwish they would hold the person accountable and not the religion, group, or<br/>\nmovement.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy in FL     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamkmm2@...\">mamkmm2@...</a><br/>\nMy Website:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.easyfunschool.com\">http://www.easyfunschool.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21790,"nextTopicId":21835}}
