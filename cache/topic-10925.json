I find that I like <br/>\nmy friends to be a big mix of people, not just moms with kids the same ages <br/>\nas mine.  It&#39;s kind of along the same lines as the unschooling effect of <br/>\nkids, where we point out to people that there&#39;s nothing natural about them <br/>\nbeing segregated by age all day.  I feel like I don&#39;t automatically have <br/>\nanything in common with people because they happened to have kids near the <br/>\nsame times that I did.<br/>\n     I really hate those groups where all everyone talks about are recipes, <br/>\ngood places to shop, schools, daycares, etc.  It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like <br/>\nhearing about a good recipe sometimes but I really love talking about things <br/>\nthat have meaning to me and I get bored when it&#39;s just 3 or 4 hrs of <br/>\nchitchat.  So I try to have friends based upon our having common ground on <br/>\nissues that mean a lot to me.  Now with hsers it&#39;s different, especially <br/>\nunschoolers, because we do have that common ground and so that&#39;s a big help.<br/>\n     When people get into the hsing bashing, I will argue the point pretty <br/>\nstrongly if I&#39;m in the mood for it.

I invariably get that reaction from children when they learn we <br/>\nhomeschool.  &#39;really?  how cool!&#39;  and even &#39;can you homeschool me?&#39;.  DS <br/>\ngets the same reaction when meeting someone new.  Then some children decide <br/>\nto tease him about it...but that&#39;s mostly a cousin and another child at <br/>\nchurch.  They are both decidely jealous!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis jealousy on the part of the children has caused them to ask their <br/>\nparents why they don&#39;t homeschool.  I do know it has caused some friction in <br/>\ntheir homes.  One cousin teases my 11 yo ds, another has refused to go to <br/>\nschool.  His mother has to literally drag him (age 10) to his class and hand <br/>\nhim over to the teacher.  She has gone so far as to call the school and ask <br/>\nthat an intervention specialist come to her home and get her child.  At that <br/>\npoint she was informed that they would have to call the sheriff&#39;s office and <br/>\nhim picked up by the sheriff and then the family would have to appear in <br/>\nfamily court to answer charges!  So, (in her mind) her choices are to drag <br/>\nthe kid to school or fear that she will be charged with truancy at $25/day.  <br/>\nI feel sad for her.  Sometimes I feel guilty that our homeschooling &#39;seems&#39; <br/>\nto cause her problems.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe real irony here is that when they were pregnant with their first child <br/>\n(14 months between her oldest and my youngest), they were determined that <br/>\nthey would homeschool their children.  They are the ones who sent me in the <br/>\nright direction to find answers about state laws.  Yet, I&#39;m the one that took <br/>\nmy teenager out of ps and have never sent my youngest to ps.  Go figure.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(of course, I am the one that wanted to homeschool all along, but when it was <br/>\ntime to send my oldest to school they were arresting parents in my area <br/>\n(Omaha at the time) for refusing to send their kids.  I wasn&#39;t up to the <br/>\nchallenge.  We had no funds and it would have been the end of my husbands <br/>\nmilitary career....although we left the military a year later anyway...&lt;BEG&gt; <br/>\nthey threatened him with court martial if I didn&#39;t enroll the child.  I am <br/>\nvery grateful to those that took the chance and spent the money and energy <br/>\nand paid high personal prices to pave the way for my homeschooling <br/>\nexperience!

One of the best things that <br/>\nI have found, is to be very confident in my stating that we homeschool.  I <br/>\ndeliberately will not be too quiet around others that do not homeschool, <br/>\nbecause I want them to know I am happy and proud of the choice made.  But, in <br/>\nno way do I shove it down their throats.  For example, What I do, is casually <br/>\nadd to educational conversations how we are studying tadpoles and frogs this <br/>\nsummer, and how we branched that off into learning about fish.  Usually <br/>\npeople are very interested, and often will remark how homeschooling sounds so <br/>\ngreat.  I express how excited the kids are in their learning, and the various <br/>\nactivities they can participate in  within our community.  Overall, the more <br/>\nenthusiastic I am, the more interested others are too.    When I a have been <br/>\nasked the &quot;socializaton&quot; questions, I tell them about the co-op we have here, <br/>\nwhere kids can join a band, choir, drama team, book review club, sports, <br/>\netc...Most people are amazed that there are so many choices out there.
