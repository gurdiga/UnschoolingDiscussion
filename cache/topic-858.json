I used<br/>\nto sweat about it until i realized that they really don&#39;t care--so i write a<br/>\nbrief narrative statement about continuing our explorations in xyz, using<br/>\neducationally and developmentally appropriate materials, etc. I don&#39;t expect<br/>\nproblems and have never had them!!<br/>\n   DEbra&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe kept &quot;residency&quot; in IN to avoid all that &quot;crap&quot;  & paperwork; but I have <br/>\nto pass on this from a Hser here in NH.<br/>\nShe was all hyped up trying to meet their deadline to submit their intended <br/>\ncurriculum & materials.
