It&#39;s not something that most people will even think to question.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor many of us, it&#39;s difficult to separate what must be done from what we&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen told must be done. The way many of us were raised is *based* on having<br/>\nthe child trust that what the parent or teacher or other adult says is true.<br/>\n(You must do your howework or you can&#39;t learn. You must go to bed early or<br/>\nyou&#39;ll be tired. You must eat a good breakfast or you&#39;ll run out of energy.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI love structure and order. For me to have &quot;followed my heart&quot; would have<br/>\nmeant having my daughter do Calvert. It wouldn&#39;t have led me to unschooling.<br/>\nI offer the advice I do (at least on the message boards!) because I know how<br/>\ndifficult it was for me to learn to identify where my &quot;heart&quot; and what I<br/>\nbelieved was best for her was getting in the way of what my daughter needed.<br/>\nSo perhaps better unschooling advice is to learn how to listen to your<br/>\n*child&#39;s* heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully the *Unschooling* list and website is a place to do that. It&#39;s not<br/>\na *follow your heart* list, though ultimately many will find that&#39;s what<br/>\nthey are doing once they identify all the garbage that was getting in the<br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sarah Carothers","from":"&quot;Sarah Carothers&quot; &lt;puddles@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"MN-ktBblff01CGilMuRddtRG0JE5lo2D0N96sFDCxbrA7piFmOwK3H7UP8d3WR0Ol62HIpJcV4FbOA5zmiwqOWnQ6AVSFM3DFg0-KQiJ6Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] The True Meaning Of Unschooling","postDate":"1000774759","msgId":25899,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNzkwMWMxM2ZkZCQyNjJkMjY2MCQ0NzAxYThjMEB0cmlhZC5yci5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDlvMnJvNStncTJsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8M0JBNTJFNjIuMjJFMEQ4OTJAaXgubmV0Y29tLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":25883,"nextInTopic":25924,"prevInTime":25898,"nextInTime":25900,"topicId":25821,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

All","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1864555057\">For those that want to know what unschooling really is all about, all <br/>\nthe supposed experts in the world are not going to come up with &quot;a&quot; <br/>\ndefinition.  All those definitions are going to be colored by their <br/>\npersonal feelings of what it is or by their need to be &quot;the&quot; expert <br/>\nwith &quot;the&quot; answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead, listen and then take what you need because the true definition <br/>\nof unschooling is a life style that doesn&#39;t discriminate against <br/>\nchildren because they aren&#39;t old enough to vote yet, a life style <br/>\nthat not only allows them a voice but a life style that actively <br/>\nlistens to their voices.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no one correct way to unschool and the experts can stomp up <br/>\nand down and be blunt (spell that rude) and authoritarian and badger <br/>\npeople and try to wear them down by repeating over and over their <br/>\nopinion (and it is only an opinion) but it won&#39;t change the <br/>\nunderlying facts, every child is an individual, all families are made <br/>\nup of individuals and thus, there is NO ONE RIGHT WAY.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is only one rigid, unflexible definition of unschooling and <br/>\nonly one right way then that equates to &quot;different dog, same smell&quot; <br/>\nand is no different than the public school system where everyone is <br/>\npigeon holed by &quot;the&quot; experts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI, personally, have never understood how anyone can claim all this <br/>\nexpert knowledge when they have no finished product to prove their <br/>\ntheories.  Would you go to a person to help you bake the perfect cake <br/>\nif they had never done anything but mix ingredients together but <br/>\nnever finished the job by baking the cake to see if it would indeed <br/>\ncome out right?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my advise, look to those who are successful and not out tooting <br/>\ntheir own horns.  Look to the owner of this list.  Helen has grown <br/>\nchildren who are successful in life--happy and enjoying their life.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook to people that will share their own journey with you such as the <br/>\npeople at Winona Farm.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, in the final answer, trust yourself as you are the only one that <br/>\nknows your own family and their INDIVIDUAL needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nTery</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25969,"nextTopicId":25972}}
