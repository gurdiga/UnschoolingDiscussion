I have often counseled other mothers who are overwhelmed <br/>\nand feeling trapped in no-ville that they should find a way to say yes <br/>\nto whatever their kids want at any given moment.  Many times it just <br/>\nlifts the spirits of everyone and the kid feels loved after a short time <br/>\nof yeses and won&#39;t harangue and harrass mom so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned this from my dad.  He&#39;s such a *great* dad.  I remember my mom <br/>\nwas always the &quot;no&quot; person.  But one time he stuck up for me, and <br/>\ninsisted I be allowed to go on a high school spring break ski trip.  I <br/>\nwill always love him for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my oldest children were little, Dad would take them for a couple of <br/>\nweeks at a time.  (I was single then, and he was giving me a break.)  He <br/>\nalways reported that they behaved perfectly and were happy and had a <br/>\ngood time.  They always came back completely centered and content.  He <br/>\nsaid that was because he resolved when my eldest was born to never say <br/>\n&quot;no&quot; to his grandchildren, even if he knew what they were asking he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t possibly provide.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThink about how hard that would be?  Never say no?  Sometimes he had to <br/>\nbe creative; he would say &quot;later&quot; or engage them in conversation about <br/>\nit until they came to the conclusion that they didn&#39;t need/want it.  But <br/>\nbecause he&#39;d never said no to even their tiniest request, they&#39;ve never <br/>\nasked for anything impossible.  This is some of the best advice found in <br/>\n&quot;How to Talk so Kids Will Listen...&quot;, too.  And he&#39;s probably never even <br/>\nheard of that book.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids never ask him for anything anymore, because they know he&#39;d give <br/>\nit to them, and they&#39;re grown up enough and love him enough to not want <br/>\nto burden him.  He has a very nice Jeep and a ski boat and numerous <br/>\nother toys, that they know they can use anytime.  But they don&#39;t.  I <br/>\nthink just knowing they can is enough.  And they express true gratitude <br/>\nto him, which is nice to see.  They think the world of each other.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard, hard, hard when you&#39;re the parent and not the grandparent, to <br/>\nhave a relationship with your kids like that.

For example, I just let both of my kids drop out of Suzuki music programs this year because I really want them being the ones to decide if they want to be musicians.  Well,  of course, I get from most people at the school that I need to force that on them because they don&#39;t know what&#39;s &#39;best&#39; for them.  Yuck!!  They don&#39;t give credit where credit is due, that both my kids are doing other things and sit down at our old piano and pick out songs, or walk around playing instruments/doing a parade for us.

I <br/>\nreally think she&#39;s in la-la land if she thinks her sons will never want <br/>\nto do some kind of gun play.  Even if her 5 yo is compliant (which I&#39;ve <br/>\nheard he&#39;s NOT when she&#39;s not looking), she has no idea what the baby is <br/>\ngoing to be like.  And our children are often very different from each <br/>\nother!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you, Sandra.  We show common courtesy in groups until we <br/>\nfind out what is acceptable.
