We aren&#39;t into SCA, but several homeschoolers in<br/>\n&gt; our group are. One family is pretty active in the Celtic festival here<br/>\n&gt; (sometime in the summer, but I don&#39;t know exactly when but could find out).<br/>\n&gt; We have a studio apartment in our basement, so we&#39;re pretty well equipped<br/>\n&gt; for visitors.<br/>\n&gt; Hey, he could do the unschooling house tour of the mainland! Now a cool way<br/>\n&gt; to do it would be to have each family drive him to the next family&#39;s house,<br/>\n&gt; then we could meet up with even more fun folks and road trip at the same<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, he could come here too, and get to know all the wierd people in Salem and <br/>\nBoston! <br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70268,"nextTopicId":70133}}
