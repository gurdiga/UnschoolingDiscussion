This is a nice shed built by a <br/>\nchain (in CA; there&#39;s probably something similar in Florida) called The Shed <br/>\nShop.  We had it built about 4 years ago for less than $4000, including <br/>\nskylights, four windows, good locking door.  It&#39;s 120 sq. feet, which is the <br/>\nlargest allowed in our city (and another I know of - it may be a standard <br/>\nthing) without a permit.  Smaller ones cost less of course.  We hired an <br/>\nelectrical contractor to do electricity (but skipped the permit - feeling a <br/>\nlittle guilty explaining that one to my kids).   And now it has a phone line <br/>\nand is on a network with our house computer.  So Daddy&#39;s office is in the <br/>\nbackyard and we can be home and live our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now, it turns out he&#39;ll be starting a business and using that shed as a <br/>\nworkshop which I think is really cool because he&#39;ll be enough away to give us <br/>\nspace but close enough for us to be involved in the business.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have another homeschooling friend with a work-at-home spouse.  He works out <br/>\nof a spare bedroom.  When their daughter went through a screaming phase, they <br/>\nstressed about it a lot, but it really helped to buy a soundproof door for a <br/>\nfew hundred.  Apparently much of the sound comes through the door rather than <br/>\nwalls.  (Of course with my kids, sometimes they&#39;re banging on the wall!  They <br/>\nalways bang the recliner into it.  The other day I was at the bathroom sink <br/>\njust the other side of the wall from the recliner and bang, the medicine <br/>\ncabinet popped open!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope these ideas help.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam T., still around and appreciating the wisdom on this list<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57408,"nextTopicId":57499}}
