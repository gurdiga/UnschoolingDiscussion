The spring in the battery<br/>\n  compartments of these toys can dislodge, causing a burning   hazard if the<br/>\nbatteries overheat or rupture. <br/>\nTwo models of   Lightsaber toys are involved in this recall. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Darth Maul(TM)   Double-Bladed Lightsaber with retractable red plastic &quot;light<br/>\n  blades&quot; and a metallic-gray hand grip and <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Qui-Gon Jinn(TM)   Lightsaber with a single retractable &quot;light blade&quot; made<br/>\nof green   plastic that extends to about 3 feet. <br/>\nBoth Lightsaber toys   operate with two &quot;C&quot; batteries. Mass merchandise and<br/>\ntoy stores   nationwide sold these Lightsabers from May 1999 through June  <br/>\n1999 for $20 to $30. <br/>\nYou can contact Hasbro to *get a free   repair kit containing instructions on<br/>\nhow to install a battery   protector. <br/>\n<br/>\n*get a free repair kit -  <br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=625&url=1\">http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=625&url=1</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNATIONWIDE RECALL OF DIVE STICKS UNDERWAY <br/>\nDo(es) your child(ren) use dive sticks in the swimming pool? If so, you   should<br/>\nbe aware that 19 million of these pool toys are being   recalled due to the<br/>\nrisk of facial, eye, rectal and vaginal   impalement, especially in shallow<br/>\nwater.<br/>\nThe dive sticks are   hard plastic and are either cylinder-shaped or shark-shaped.<br/>\n  When dropped into water, the dive sticks sink to the bottom of a   pool and<br/>\nstand upright so that children can swim or dive down   and retrieve them. The<br/>\nsticks come in a variety of colors and   are often packaged in kits of three<br/>\nto six, occasionally with   other pool diving games.<br/>\n They have been sold for about $4 to $7   per set under numerous brand names.<br/>\nIn some cases, a refund,   repair or replacement is available. <br/>\n*Read more about this recall   at the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Read more about this recall - <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=628&url=1\">http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=628&url=1</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*SOCK MONKEY RECALLED <br/>\nSewing needles and pins found in the stuffing of some Sock Monkey   stuffed<br/>\nanimals have prompted a recall from Restoration Hardware   Inc. and the U.S.<br/>\nConsumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).   These monkeys are about 16 to 20<br/>\ninches tall and made of a brown   tweed-like knit fabric with white hands and<br/>\nfeet. Restoration   Hardware&#39;s stores, catalogs and web sites sold the monkeys<br/>\nfrom   October 1997 through May 1999 for about $29. <br/>\nYou can return the   monkeys to any Restoration Hardware store for a refund<br/>\nand a   discount merchandise certificate.<br/>\n *Read more about this recall   from the CPSC. <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=634&url=1\">http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=634&url=1</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n*JUST IN: <br/>\nANOTHER RECALL OF INFANT CARRIERS <br/>\nParents of small infants, especially under 2 months of age,   should be extra<br/>\ncareful when using infant carriers. Following   the recall of the Baby Bjorn<br/>\ninfant carrier earlier this year,   the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission<br/>\n(CPSC) and Evenflo   Company are recalling models 075 and 080 Snugli� soft infant<br/>\n  carriers. As with the Baby Bjorn carrier, small babies can shift   to one<br/>\nside, slip through the leg openings of these carriers and   fall. The carriers<br/>\nare in color combinations of royal blue with   magenta trim, teal with navy<br/>\nblue trim, and navy blue with   purple trim. Retail stores nationwide sold these<br/>\ncarriers   between January 1996 and May 1999 for about $40. Parents can   contact<br/>\nEvenflo to receive instructions on how to <br/>\n<br/>\n*exchange the carrier for a free, new carrier with smaller leg   openings -<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=632&url=1\">http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=632&url=1</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLIFEMINDERS FAMILY ==================  <br/>\n-Health, Safety and Nutrition- <br/>\nIS YOUR CHILD OVERWEIGHT? <br/>\nAre you concerned about your child&#39;s weight?

Infants under six months   should be kept out of direct<br/>\nsunlight altogether, but older kids   need sunscreen since 60%-80% of a person�s<br/>\nsun exposure usually   happens before the age of 18.<br/>\n <br/>\nHere are some safe sun tips: <br/>\n<br/>\n1. Don�t use sunscreens that are more than two or three years old   since heat<br/>\nand age can diminish their effectiveness. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Be generous when you apply. Use about an ounce - or a palmful   - to cover<br/>\nyour child�s exposed skin. (Studies show that most of   us tend to underapply).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Don�t know what SPF is right for your child? <br/>\nConsult the   *Coppertone Sun Safety Selector to find out. <br/>\n<br/>\nFind out more information about *keeping children safe in the sun   from the<br/>\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics. <br/>\n<br/>\n***HOT DEAL*** <br/>\n*Win a Disney cruise for your family from Coppertone. <br/>\n<br/>\n*Coppertone Sun Safety Selector - <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=633&url=1\">http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=633&url=1</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n*keeping children safe in the sun from the American Academy of   Pediatrics<br/>\n- <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=633&url=2\">http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=633&url=2</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n*Win a Disney cruise for your family from Coppertone -   &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=633&url=3\">http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=633&url=3</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -General Family Life- <br/>\n10 WAYS TO NURTURE YOUR FAMILY&#39;S SPIRIT <br/>\nPersonal spirituality has become one of the hot topics of the   late &#39;90s and<br/>\nnow psychologists are examining the spirituality   of the family -- how a set<br/>\nof shared beliefs can help families   weather a crisis, such as a serious illness.<br/>\n It&#39;s easy for   hectic schedules to eliminate any time for such reflection,<br/>\nbut   if you&#39;re interested in unearthing the spirit of your own   family, pick<br/>\nup  *10 Principles for Spiritual Parenting or click   on *How Can Spirituality<br/>\nAffect Your Family&#39;s Health? <br/>\n<br/>\n*10 Principles for Spiritual Parenting - <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=627&url=1\">http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=627&url=1</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n*How Can Spirituality Affect Your Family&#39;s Health? -  <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=627&url=2\">http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=627&url=2</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n*Free SmarterKids.com Newsletter & $5 Instant Coupon -   &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=627&url=3\">http://www.lfmn.com/r/sr.asp?u=164639&v=4843&s=627&url=3</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n ----------------------------------------------------------- <br/>\n**ADVERTISEMENTS**<br/>\n  FREE Software!  <br/>\nChoose From Today�s Popular Titles!
