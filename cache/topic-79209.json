At each stop along<br/>\nthe way there was a copy of the clue for each kid - and they<br/>\ncompared their thoughts about what the words were as well as the<br/>\npicture of the next stop.  A couple of the clues were<br/>\naccidentally too tough, but in the general conversation it was<br/>\neasy for an adult to help focus on possibilities in the yard.<br/>\nIt also helped that the clues for the next stop were attached to<br/>\nthe stop with a pretty bright bit of gold ribbon, so the kids<br/>\nweren&#39;t beating all the way around the apple tree to find the<br/>\nnext batch of clues.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur treasure was a bag for each child of 10 coins from the &quot;bad<br/>\ncondition&quot; bin at a coin dealers and 1o jewels from the polished<br/>\nrock barrel at a museum - it was the perfect treasure for 4s, if<br/>\nyou haven&#39;t already decided what to bury. - and do bury it if<br/>\nyou can, a shovel is a great arm of the X that marks the spot.<br/>\nNow, 3 years later, some of the kids who came to the most recent<br/>\nbirthday party took  newer friends around to see where they had<br/>\ndug up buried treasure and to talk about each stop.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Dawn Blum&quot; &lt;dawnblum@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 27, 2003 2:30 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [Unschooling-Discussion] OT a little help please<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| a wading pool<br/>\n| a pond<br/>\n| a bar<br/>\n| tents<br/>\n| tunnels<br/>\n|<br/>\n| How about Pirates cove for the pool, Dead mans swamp for the<br/>\npond, The Jolly<br/>\n| Roger for the bar call the tents either the camp or skull<br/>\ncave, and the<br/>\n| tunnels... how about Black Beards Maze?<br/>\n| also try these sites for other ideas..<br/>\n| HYPERLINK<br/>\n|<br/>\n&quot;http://www.birthdaypartyideas.com/html/pirate_party.html&quot;http:/<br/>\n/www.birthda<br/>\n| ypartyideas.com/html/pirate_party.html<br/>\n| try this Pirate name generator, it isn&#39;t for the little kids..<br/>\nbut not<br/>\n| really dirty either it could be something fun to do with the<br/>\nadults when<br/>\n| they arrive. it is a 2 page quiz.<br/>\n| HYPERLINK<br/>\n|<br/>\n&quot;http://www.fidius.org/quiz/pirate.php&quot;http://www.fidius.org/qui<br/>\nz/pirate.php<br/>\n| Here is a list of names you could put these on to slips of<br/>\npaper and put<br/>\n| them into hats and have the kids pick out one at random.

But I know <br/>\nthat in many states, it&#39;s much easier on parents and families if they can be <br/>\npart of an &quot;umbrella school&quot;....a group &quot;run&quot; by a licensed educator, that <br/>\nkeeps records for the families, maybe helps with portfolio evaluations to satisfy <br/>\nthe legal requirements in some states.  Someone that newbies can ask for <br/>\nhelp??  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in a state that requires a portfolio evaluation or testing.  As far <br/>\nas I know, there are no &quot;umbrella&quot; schools for unschoolers, or for <br/>\nhomeschoolers for that matter, in our state.  I know many parents who would LOVE to be <br/>\nable to sign up each year under such a &quot;school&quot; and be able to kiss the public <br/>\nschool system (and evaluations) goodbye.  We were under such a school in CA and <br/>\nNEVER had to deal with the state because we were part of a PRIVATE SCHOOL!  <br/>\nThe lady who ran it was wonderful...was able to issue high school diplomas too.  <br/>\nShe took a huge load off of our shoulders, planned field trips (which were <br/>\noptional), did all the paperwork,...she earned her money big time.  We all paid <br/>\nher 300 per year (per family) which we were able to pay quarterly.  Since <br/>\nthere were about 50 families in the group, she obviously didn&#39;t get rich (her <br/>\nhusband worked also) and I know she spent a lot of money on stuff for the families <br/>\n(she threw a mother&#39;s day tea one year that was soooo sweet.)  The best thing <br/>\nabout the group was that it was very informal, almost no requirements, you <br/>\ncould homeschool in any style,  and we met frequently (which my children now <br/>\nmiss.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a son I just started unschooling this year who is classified as a <br/>\nspecial ed child.  i KNOW it will be the best thing for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in W.V.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":158112576,"authorName":"Teresa","from":"&quot;Teresa&quot; &lt;TeresaBnNC@...&gt;","profile":"tbb1967","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: hi","postDate":"1061942249","msgId":79212,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJpZ3M1OSs4c2tmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJpZ3F0OSs4ZWJxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":79210,"nextInTopic":79217,"prevInTime":79211,"nextInTime":79213,"topicId":79209,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
