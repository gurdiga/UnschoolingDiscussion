He is very concerned that <br/>\nSimon be able to balance his checkbook when the time comes.  I went <br/>\nthrough and ordered them numerically, so all of the 0 + X were <br/>\ntogether, from 1 to 9, I think and the same with the subtraction.  I <br/>\nput them away.  Simon asked later on to play them.  I held them and <br/>\nhe answered them &quot;0,1,2,3...&quot; repeating the counting as he went.  At <br/>\nsome point David (dh) grabbed one at random and flashed it at Simon <br/>\n(I like the idea of flashcards producing flashers).  Simon explained <br/>\nto him that we were doing it in order and that he didn&#39;t want to do <br/>\nit at random.  We continued for a while and then built card houses <br/>\nwith them.  David and I had a long conversation about the value of <br/>\nboth methods.
