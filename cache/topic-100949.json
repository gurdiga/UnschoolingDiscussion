She <br/>\nfigured it out on one of the games where you juggle and when you clap <br/>\nthe monkey throws you more things to juggle. Well, she was getting <br/>\nexcited and shrieking and we couldn&#39;t figure out why everytime she <br/>\nplayed the monkey went crazy throwing her bananas. ;)  Finally we <br/>\nrealized he hears her screaming in excitement and thinks it&#39;s a <br/>\nclap.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo today she was playing with her friend and all I heard coming out <br/>\nof the room was 2 pre-teen girls&#39; shrieking screams during the parts <br/>\nof the songs requiring lots of clapping.  They said they get more <br/>\ncoins and their hands don&#39;t get sore from clapping.  I wonder if <br/>\ntheir throats are sore now instead of their hands? lol <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My son, George showed me that you can slap the side of one of the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>bongos instead of clapping.
