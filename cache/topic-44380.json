He said <br/>\nbeginners didn&#39;t know how to read music, intermediates knew the fingerings of <br/>\nat least a full scale.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I learned the fingerings.  It was easy because I had played clarinet in <br/>\nElementary and Jr. High.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played with John Truitt throughout the rest of college.

I went <br/>\nregularly to his intermediate class.  I never ignored his advice.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nbe telling the truth if I said &quot;self taught&quot; about recorder, but I played <br/>\nsongs I chose myself, and I did research myself all along, in addition to <br/>\ndoing things John and Floyd thought would be good for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"self taught","postDate":"1032467169","msgId":44380,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMC4xODkzZGRjMy4yYWJiOGNlMUBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":44445,"prevInTime":44379,"nextInTime":44381,"topicId":44380,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/19/02 2:36:46 PM Central Daylight Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-539534721\">In a message dated 9/19/02 2:36:46 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; The difference between an artist who becomes an artist and one who just <br/>\ntakes <br/>\n art classes, or the difference between a pianist and a piano student is <br/>\n likely to have to do with how much they did beyond and above the class <br/>\n assignments.<br/>\n <br/>\n Doing extra makes you &quot;real&quot; but it doesn&#39;t make you self-taught. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I see it more as the attitude with the person learning.<br/>\nI have learned a lot of art from just looking and reading and doing.<br/>\nBut then I&#39;ve picked up some techniques at classes, without following <br/>\neverything the teacher taught.<br/>\nSo I feel self taught, but have had teachers.
