We have lots of<br/>\nbirds, the occasional pheasant, raccoon, or owl.  We<br/>\nhave a good garden, an old house and lots of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore kids, I was a homebody... a reader, crafter,<br/>\nmovie-watcher kinda gal. But Sophia is a go-er...very<br/>\nsocial and active and wanting to be involved and<br/>\nplaying a lot of the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUp until lately, we&#39;ve been really busy.  We do things<br/>\nthe girls enjoy.  Going here and there, yonder and<br/>\nyon... show my kids *more*, eat out *more*, buy<br/>\n*more*. More smells, more tastes, more sights, more<br/>\nsounds.  (Aren&#39;t we Zen:)?)<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out, we&#39;re all really happy staying home lately.<br/>\n We&#39;re enjoying our yard, cold as it&#39;s been.  And we<br/>\nare really enjoying re-watching movies we&#39;ve already<br/>\nseen, playing computer games and board games we<br/>\nhaven&#39;t played in awhile, listening to books on tape,<br/>\nmaking lots of messes, cooking and rearranging<br/>\nfurniture.  I&#39;m emailing to touch base with a<br/>\ncommunity I don&#39;t have IRL, and my girls are playing<br/>\nwith each other a lot.  And arguing a little.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re getting great snail mail lately--magazines and<br/>\nbooks and birthday presents and craft kits and posters<br/>\nand Florida shells.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had some fun visitors and some visitors we could<br/>\nhave done without.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re reading the paper every day to find a doggie<br/>\ncompanion for our 10 year old wolf-lab cross.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re watching the wild cat family when we don&#39;t scare<br/>\nthem away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re finding new songs for the iPod. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re playing guitar and recorder and drums and<br/>\nsinging and making up songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re calling old friends on the phone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re counting down the days to a birthday.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been following obscure Internet links.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re having food delivered instead of going out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re finding things on eBay that are interesting and<br/>\nhaving them delivered.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re doing some of the craft projects from our *many*<br/>\ncraft books.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re knitting and making wrapping paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re figuring out ways to make no-sew doll clothes<br/>\nfor American Girls and creating hair salons for the<br/>\nplethora of dolls at our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re really busy and engaged and learning and we&#39;re<br/>\nsticking really close to home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is huge for me.  &quot;Mom,&quot;  Sophia said, with a big<br/>\nsmile, &quot;Lets stay home for a whole year!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been a little more relaxed.   We&#39;re getting to<br/>\nknow each other a little better because we&#39;re getting<br/>\nto know ourselves better because we&#39;re thinking a bit<br/>\nmore because we have time because we&#39;re not rushing<br/>\naround because we&#39;re staying home and we&#39;re still<br/>\nlearning and happy and engaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we have resources here to last a<br/>\nwhile...remnants of over-strewing and over-yard<br/>\nsale-ing, Christmas leftovers and oldie-goldies.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, part of the reason we&#39;ve been home is an injury,<br/>\nthen a sickness.  We&#39;re healed, for the most part. <br/>\nAnd the requests to go have started coming again.  The<br/>\ngirls like to be active, too.  So Sophia is sleeping<br/>\nover at Grandma&#39;s tonight, then gymnastics tomorrow,<br/>\nand girls club and ceramics on Tuesday. Eva&#39;s got<br/>\ndance which she loves, then the hot springs on<br/>\nThursday because they really want to go swimming,<br/>\nFriday play date and a Saturday birthday with a<br/>\nsleepover in a different town and the yurt on Sunday<br/>\nand skiing on Monday...and I&#39;m a little sad that our<br/>\ncocoon time is ending and a little glad to get fresh<br/>\nair.  I think we&#39;ll remember, though, that we don&#39;t<br/>\n*have* to keep busy outside of the house, our own<br/>\nhouse is full of learning and fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when the next ebb comes, we&#39;ll be ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Anderson-Thimmes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
