My oldest son and I were<br/>\ndoing some research on snakes. With my school mindset, I asked him what<br/>\nquestions we need to answer to put together on snakes, thinking of stuff<br/>\nlike what they look like, where they live, etc. HIS questions though, were<br/>\nwhy do they have forked tongues, why do they shed their skins, and my<br/>\nfavourite, will they evolve into something else. I love it when he forces me<br/>\nto think outside of my sometimes narrow framework!<br/>\nAbout the siblings - that is a struggle around here sometimes too, although<br/>\ntoday when they couldn&#39;t seem to get along I separated them into their own<br/>\nrooms, and told them I was angry because they weren&#39;t being good friends to<br/>\neach other. Within a few minutes, my five year old had crept into the three<br/>\nyear old&#39;s room to ask him to play again, then they shouted down the stairs<br/>\nto me that they were being kind to &quot;our ch&#39;other&quot;<br/>\nSeparation seems a fate worse than any, I guess.<br/>\nI was just at the Oak meadow site, inspired by what I&#39;ve read on the list,<br/>\nand if it ever becomes necessary for me to register with a private school<br/>\nlike that, that&#39;s sure the way I &#39;d go. I put in a subscription to the<br/>\nmagazine too - it looks wonderful.<br/>\nSorry, too long again - I seem to save up my thoughts then dump them at<br/>\nonce!<br/>\nLeanne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5955,"nextTopicId":6004}}
