It&#39;s been interesting for me to notice how I<br/>\n&quot;parent&quot; these kids onstage, and how quickly we&#39;ve gotten into a nice<br/>\ngroove. One of my &quot;daughters&quot; was having trouble &quot;cheating out&quot;, so half<br/>\nthe audience was seeing her back The director reminded her about it (in<br/>\nsort of a shaming way) but it didn&#39;t change much. Her real mother told<br/>\nher about it a few times, too, that I heard. I noticed last weekend that<br/>\nduring the two parts of the show where that had been an issue, I&#39;d<br/>\nstarted putting my arm around her and sort of hugging her to me and<br/>\nsmiling down at her, which results in her being perfectly placed. At<br/>\nanother point, she was supposed to end up with her &quot;family&quot; during a<br/>\nscary scene, and she was ending up way across the stage - so I started<br/>\nmaking sure I swooped her up with me as I moved to my &quot;husband&quot; and we<br/>\nfearfully go to him together. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t how the other people treat the kids, or even how most of the<br/>\nkids generally treat each other. Most are kind, but the emphasis is on<br/>\n&quot;You need to cheat out.&quot; rather than, &quot;How can we arrange things so<br/>\ncheating out happens naturally?&quot;. And the kids this, they want to look<br/>\ngood out there, and have the show look good. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt just seems that so many things get turned into a power struggle rather<br/>\nthan being solutions-oriented.
