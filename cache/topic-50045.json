Perhaps a checkup is a good <br/>\nplace to start to put a check on the niggling worry, since you&#39;re sure you <br/>\ncan&#39;t find out anything more.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;d be surprised how many adoption records were &quot;destroyed in a fire&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50041,"nextTopicId":49775}}
