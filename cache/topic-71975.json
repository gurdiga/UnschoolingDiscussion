We both pretty <br/>\nmuch agreed what limits we had to things we would do for $ 1million.. <br/>\nBasically, anything except eat shit, commit a heinous violent crime like rape or <br/>\nassault, or kill an innocent person.

ANYBODY?? that could be some horribly nasty no toothed <br/>\nstinking greasy 500 pound man or woman.. ughghg.. And then I thought.. about all <br/>\nof the horrible evil folks that I said I would kill for $1million ,, would I <br/>\nalso be willing to have sex with them???  What about sex with a pedophile who <br/>\nwas fantasizing I was  kid????  OK, so then we re-thought the having sex with <br/>\nanybody for $1million..<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, $1million to us is a LOT of money.. more than we can really <br/>\neven imagine.

To some folks $1million is chump change.. like me going to <br/>\nspend $20 at Wal-mart.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso along these lines of discussion,  Landon and I had another good <br/>\nconversation this morning about a magazine article I read about Kentucky horse <br/>\nbreeding.    I said that it is so unbelievable that folks will spend millions of <br/>\ndollars on a horse, but a baby on the black market will do go for thousands.   <br/>\nAlso, comparing the prices for these horses to the price of a human life in terms <br/>\nof insurance money or law suits.. It just does not compare.  But, Landon <br/>\nsaid, folks who will sell thier children are desperate, usually poor people, that <br/>\na few thousand dollars seems like a fortune.  I love these talks with him.  I <br/>\nhave had to drive him to work the past two morning cause  one of our cars is <br/>\nout of commission ( hmmm, another reason $1million would come in handy..lol.. <br/>\njust think.. ACTUAL WORKING VEHICLES!..)  I used to drive him to catch a <br/>\ncarpool to school 35 mins away every morning.  We had lovely talks for those couple <br/>\nof years.  I hadn&#39;t realized how much I missed our &quot;drive time&quot; since he got <br/>\nhis liscense.  <br/>\n<br/>\n We do still talk alot, but it seems when its just two folks in the car, the <br/>\nconversation environment is ripe.  I&#39;ve got pulled over for speeding a few <br/>\ntimes because I was so deep in conversation I wasnt paying attention.   Once, I <br/>\ngot pulled over, the officer said.. &quot;Ive been following you for 5 miles, you <br/>\nnever checked your rearview mirror once!&quot;  I said .. &quot;Oh, officer, I am so <br/>\nsorry, I was talking to my sister(she was in the car with me), we were in a deep <br/>\nconversation&quot;  He looked at me like that was the sorriest excuse he had ever <br/>\nheard..
