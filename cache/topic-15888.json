On most lists, that would get you banned. Attacking is all of the &quot;how dare you&quot;, &quot;you&#39;re wrong&quot;, &quot;you are harming your kids&quot;, &quot;you&#39;re abusing your kids&quot;, etc comments. Also grounds for banning on almost all lists. <br/>\n<br/>\n   Could you give me a quote or an example? <br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Sorry, I don&#39;t keep posts so I can&#39;t quote but I&#39;m sure you can recall some with the same and like examples I listed above. <br/>\n<br/>\n   Mabye I&#39;m just dense, but I&#39;m guessing what you perceive as an &quot;attack&quot; others perceive as honest and to the point. <br/>\n<br/>\n  ** No, I&#39;ve been on busy mailing lists for about 5 years now, and have started several myself. Those are generally accpeted and known mailing-list definitions of the words flaming and attacking. Being honest and to the point would include &quot;spanking is harmful and this is why...&quot; while attacking/flaming includes &quot;spanking is wrong, you are wrong, you are an abuser, you&#39;re sick&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n   You also mentioned something about being disappointed about namecalling.  Who&#39;s calling anyone names?  You don&#39;t need to answer that, but if you think about it, much of this namecalling, attacking, twisting words, etc, might just be in your own perception. <br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Again, no. For one, I have had many, many offlist e-mails assuring me this is not in my imagination. Moderator Joyce even noticed and commented onlist on the twisting and misquoting that was going on. For another, I have seen this same spanking issue come up on many different lists, and it has been gotten thru, the same points gotten across, without all of the flaming going on. It&#39;s a huge, noticable difference that no one could miss. If you guys are used to this list, and this list only, you probably don&#39;t notice the difference as much.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Take the recent post from the &quot;spanker&quot;. Several people boo&#39;d her and several flamed her. WHY didn&#39;t anyone post links showing the harm it causes children or ask her if she would consider trying another method if she had help and support to do so? Like what has been mentioned time and time again, even if the original poster isn&#39;t interested or doesn&#39;t respond, someone may very well come along and read the posts later and it may help them. Or it may help people lurking. Instead, the flames and attacks are all the people will see. How sad is that? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   If that&#39;s so, then you might want to look more closely at your reactions to these so called &quot;attacking&quot; posts to find out what exactly is bugging you so much.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** I know exactly what bugs me. It is that on a list that is so about treating children respectfully, a lot of people are really close-minded about giving adults respect. It is very hard for me to believe that adults who cannot keep tempers and a respectful tone on their computers while getting their point across, can turn to their families and show a respectful attitude towards them when something comes up that they do not agree with. Personalities come through online, sometimes more than people realize.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know from personal experience that having a major paradigm shift can be painful and cause much defensiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Patti<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Then you should be able to understand that people who are going through or starting to go through a paradigm shift need help and support from friends, not attacks and flames from enemies. <br/>\n  Myranda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120206043,"authorName":"patti.schmidt2@verizon.net","from":"&lt;patti.schmidt2@...&gt;","profile":"averyschmidt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"re: list attitudes","postDate":"1035596227","msgId":48111,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDI2MDEzNzA4Lk1RSE4zMTAub3V0MDA2LnZlcml6b24ubmV0QFsxMjcuMC4wLjFdPg=="},"prevInTopic":15888,"nextInTopic":48125,"prevInTime":48110,"nextInTime":48112,"topicId":15888,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Oh, BTW, I m on two other lists that have 500+ members and neither of them have even a fraction of the flaming and attacking going on here.
