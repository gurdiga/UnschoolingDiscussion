(sorting the <br/>\nrecycling, emptying dw, scrubbing off something, delivering things to where <br/>\nthey go in the house, etc.)  before this recent change in him, he would amuse <br/>\nhimself for long periods playing with his trucks and tractors or whatever.  <br/>\nnow he just is looking for more.  anyway, all this to say that his comments <br/>\nmay be just a reflection (like you said) of him looking for a bit more, and <br/>\nyou can address that-- add some new activities, etc without attatching the <br/>\nschool issue perhaps.  although it would be fun when he is in a good mood to <br/>\nlisten to him tell you what school might be like.  or to make up stories <br/>\nabout it, fantasize what he would like it to be etc....<br/>\nerin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7302,"nextTopicId":7306}}
