That if you <br/>\nrespect your children and are open and honest with them about <br/>\nserious (and other issues as well) issues, they will be able to <br/>\nmake informed decisions.  I realize that my child will not always <br/>\nmake the same decisions that I would have and that I have to <br/>\nallow her that freedom.  I didn&#39;t mean to sound as though I wish <br/>\nto control her and make all choices in life for her.  Only that I <br/>\nhope to instill in her the values that our family has on certain <br/>\nissues so that she has the tools that she needs to make her <br/>\nown choices.  I guess I just started to second guess myself and <br/>\npanicked when I thought of her becoming a teen who might <br/>\nmake bad decisions, as we all do from time to time.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy own mother has been deceased for 11 years but, I suppose I <br/>\nshould have been able to look back on how she raised me and <br/>\nhow I acted as a teen to answer my own question.  She was <br/>\nopen and honest and I always felt like I could talk to her about <br/>\nanything.  Although she was not trying to be my best friend (her <br/>\njob was to teach and guide me, not to befriend me), that&#39;s exactly <br/>\nwhat happened.  As a result of her openness and honesty, I <br/>\nalways WANTED to get her opinion on things going on in my life.  <br/>\nAfter her death, I made some REALLY bad choices.  Choices <br/>\nwhich I KNOW I would not have made if she were living.  I just <br/>\nhope that my daughter feels the same way about me that I felt for <br/>\nmy mother.  I suppose all I can do is what you all have said (and <br/>\nwhat my own mother did) be honest, open, and willing to <br/>\ndiscuss anything and keep my fingers crossed that she turns out <br/>\nok.   :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, <br/>\nSandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; &gt;  Do &quot;they&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; (meaning teenagers) just go ahead and do what &quot;they&quot; want <br/>\n&gt; &gt; regardless of what &quot;you&quot; (as parents) think? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh!
