I have gone through<br/>\nvarious different levels of paranoia concerning my<br/>\ndd&#39;s TV watching (which gets linked into &quot;she&#39;s not<br/>\ndoing enough &#39;educational&#39; stuff&quot;). I seem to go<br/>\nthrough this when I&#39;m in a transition phase of my life<br/>\nand am not feeling very stable/strong in myself. I<br/>\nalso go through this when I am lacking unschooling<br/>\nsupport (which is why I find this list a necessary<br/>\npart of my family&#39;s wellbeing!). I don&#39;t limit TV<br/>\nwatching in our home (I have in the past and it just<br/>\nmade the TV a SUPER attractive object!). But I do use<br/>\ndistraction if I can&#39;t stand the noise of the TV<br/>\nanymore! I find that more often than not if I make a<br/>\nfew suggestions of alternative things to do,<br/>\nespecially if it involves me doing it with her, she is<br/>\nonly too eager to turn the box off. But I also finds<br/>\nthat she gets play inspiration from her videos. We<br/>\ndon&#39;t have regular TV at the moment  - no cable and<br/>\naerial not working (okay, so I&#39;m not rushing to get it<br/>\nfixed either) - so she&#39;s watching less right now<br/>\nnaturally. IMO she uses videos (and books, and movies)<br/>\nto give her ideas for themes to play in her<br/>\nimagination games. I notice she seems to need the<br/>\ninput when we haven&#39;t seen friends for a few days  and<br/>\nI think maybe because she&#39;s an only child ( it&#39;s just<br/>\nher and I ) and sometimes the ideas just dry up and<br/>\nshe needs fresh stimulus. I also don&#39;t regulate her<br/>\nfood intake, but she does!

He picks <br/>\nout the video he wants from the shelf, puts it in the vcr and presses <br/>\nplay.  When it&#39;s over, he can hit eject and take it out of the vcr.  <br/>\nWe have two tvs with vcrs and often he has a video going in two <br/>\ndifferent rooms.  Sometimes I worry that he&#39;s watching too much.  On <br/>\nthe other hand, maybe there&#39;s something that he&#39;s especially gifted <br/>\nwith that he&#39;s trying to develop through all his putting videos in <br/>\nand out of vcrs.  He does the same thing with computer games. He <br/>\nknows which button will hit and what will happen if he puts a game in <br/>\nand closes it again.  I had to teach him NOT to turn my computer off <br/>\nand on because for awhile he was getting a kick out of that and it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t very good for my computer. :)  He loves to sit and watch his <br/>\nolder brothers and sisters play computer games and although he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have the skill to use a mouse yet, he sometimes tries and I <br/>\nbet it won&#39;t be long until he can use one.  It&#39;s also amazing that he <br/>\nseems to know which video or computer cd he is going to be playing, <br/>\neven if they aren&#39;t with their cases.  Perhaps he&#39;s recognizing the <br/>\nletters or the colors and associating them with a particular story?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I do think that a true unschooler wouldn&#39;t limit tv/video watching <br/>\nas long as the child is being responsible in doing chores.

He didn&#39;t know it from a news show.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow his dad was a sadistic violent kind of guy, but IF (just if) since the <br/>\nkid had already seen some of it, the dad (who was watching it) could have <br/>\ninvited said kid to sit on his lap, and he could have told him it was an all <br/>\nmade-up story, that no such thing could really happen, and talk about <br/>\nmovie-making and make-up, it could have been a really nice session between <br/>\nthem, and the fright would have dissipated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe model of a school kid zoning out in front of a TV for five hours and then <br/>\nnot having studied his social studies which in turn inconveniences his <br/>\nteacher is a world away from my kids watching The Tick with me, and <br/>\ndiscussing literary references, or parodies of other movies and characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe report of the ideas of teachers about the effects of TV ring like <br/>\nduct-tape bells.  I see my own kids, and others I know, who can turn the TV <br/>\non when they want, and I see them turning it off as often as they turn it on. <br/>\n I see them learning, and asking intelligent questions, and NOT being average <br/>\nor lowest common denominator kinds of people, but interesting, thoughtful, <br/>\nfunny, bright people.  They live without shame and fear, while some other <br/>\nfamilies who hope to save their children from some incidental fears or ill <br/>\neffects of TV do themselves bring shame and fear into the family situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids aren&#39;t getting shame and fear from me, and neither are they getting <br/>\nit from the TV.

But think about it. That&#39;s an<br/>\naverage of 5 hours a day everyday of the year. And since it&#39;s an average<br/>\npresumably some kids are doing more to make up for those who are doing less.<br/>\nMost kids are in school and have homework and, if our town is typical,<br/>\nthey&#39;re *way* overscheduled with afterschool activities. So how are they<br/>\nmanaging to squeeze in those 35 hours? They&#39;re either pigging out on the<br/>\nweekends and over the summer, or some kids are doing nothing but TV watching<br/>\nand video game playing!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the question is -- *if* those are accurate statistics and I&#39;m having a<br/>\ntough time figuring out how it&#39;s possible -- why? Are kids using video as a<br/>\nrelaxant (as adults often do) from the stress of school? If that&#39;s so, how<br/>\ndoes that apply to unschooled kids? Do they have nothing else in their lives<br/>\nthat&#39;s more interesting? Are they disconnected to their parents and<br/>\nfamilies?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf kids are watching that much TV, is TV the cause or is TV the symptom of<br/>\nsomething else entirely?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re a TV watching family and eat dinner while watching a movie. My<br/>\ndaughter often watches cartoons and can watch as much as she wants whenever<br/>\nshe wants. She does go on binges watching a lot of TV where she might make<br/>\n35 hours in a week. And she goes on binges where she doesn&#39;t watch TV or<br/>\nplay video games or get on the computer. But as an average over a year? Not<br/>\neven close.<br/>\n<br/>\n Heavy TV viewers are less imaginative, more aggressive, and have poorer<br/>\nconcentration.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would question that on a number of levels. First I&#39;d question that it&#39;s a<br/>\n&quot;fact&quot; and not a conclusion. And poorer concentration? If they&#39;re doing<br/>\n*anything* heavily, then they&#39;re concentrating. I suspect whoever came up<br/>\nwith the study means they can&#39;t concentrate on boring school work. Perhaps<br/>\nbecause they&#39;re visual learners? Perhaps because they&#39;ve realized the<br/>\nmeaninglessness of school and are using TV as an escape so they don&#39;t *want*<br/>\nto concentrate on something they&#39;ve concluded is meaningless?<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, is TV the cause of this or a symptom? Are they agressive because of<br/>\ntheir lives and find TV a satisfying outlet?<br/>\n<br/>\n Viewing media violence can make children more aggressive, fearful,<br/>\ndisrespectful and insensitive to the effects of violence.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who watch TV with their families? Who have a parent who is available to<br/>\ndo things?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with all studies is they study schooled kids. The researchers<br/>\naren&#39;t aware of how huge an impact that school has on kids&#39; lives. And even<br/>\nif they were aware it&#39;s not a factor that can be easily eliminated.<br/>\n<br/>\n Children&#39;s TV has 5 times as many acts of violence per hour as adult TV<br/>\n(26 vs 5).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be interesting how they counted acts of violence. Is Wiley Coyote<br/>\ngetting blown up by his own inventions and stupidity violence?<br/>\n<br/>\nKids are wired differently than adults and most need actions to understand.<br/>\nThey also think getting bopped on the head or having paint dumped on someone<br/>\nis funny. It&#39;s hard to have a superhero rescuing people unless there&#39;s some<br/>\nthreat going on. Do kids watch action because that&#39;s what programmers are<br/>\nfeeding them or because that&#39;s how they make sense of the world? Kids games<br/>\nare action oriented and some are &quot;violent&quot; (involving contact). (Not that I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think programmers wouldn&#39;t take advantage of the kids&#39; need for action<br/>\nand program for maximum action to draw as many kids as possible. I think<br/>\ninsisting stations supply so many hours of educational programming per day<br/>\nis a good thing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe misuse of science is a pet peeve of mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Please remember that children under 5 are not able to make a strong<br/>\n&gt; distinction between fantasy and reality-inappropriate programming can be<br/>\n&gt; incredibly damaging.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a more appropriate warning to parents who aren&#39;t attuned to their<br/>\nkids, who are separated from their kids because of work and school. It&#39;s<br/>\nkind of hard not to be aware of what a child is getting from TV when we are<br/>\nliving right beside them. Sometimes kids get scared. Spiders or action<br/>\nfigures or picture books can scare kids. Sometimes kids get the idea they<br/>\ncan fly.
