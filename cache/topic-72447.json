(well, not the part about him hitting you over the head)<br/>\n On the other hand, my dad was so fascinated when calculators came out that<br/>\nhe payed some inordinate amount of money for one (then remember how cheap<br/>\nthey got just a couple of years later). I used one all the time as a kid (I<br/>\ncan still see the denim calculator cover I had and the Texas Instruments<br/>\nlogo) and I can do number crunching faster in my head than anyone I know.<br/>\nSometimes for kicks I race DH when he&#39;s using the calculator to figure<br/>\nsomething out and I can usually beat him.<br/>\nBoth of my kids have calculators. They love to use them and when they&#39;re<br/>\nfooling around with them it almost always sparks some interesting<br/>\ndiscussions about number and number principles. With my youngest, it&#39;s<br/>\nusually just that she can push and identify the numbers. With my son (6), he<br/>\nhas discovered all kinds of things by using the calculator. Like when you<br/>\nmultiply an even number and an odd number, you always get an even number,<br/>\nbut when you add an even number to an odd number, you always get an odd<br/>\nnumber. I think calculators can really allow kids to see things like bigger<br/>\npatterns that they might not get to see if they just sat down with paper and<br/>\npen. Also, they let my kids work with numbers bigger than they could<br/>\npersonally add/subtract/mutiply/divide on their own, so they get to see<br/>\npatterns with bigger numbers as well. Like the fact that when you multiply<br/>\nsomething by a multiple of 10, you get the same number but with<br/>\ncorrespondingly more zeros on the end.<br/>\nI dunno, I love to do math in my head all the time, and I think owning a<br/>\ncalculator as a kid helped to fuel that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"Heidi","from":"&quot;Heidi&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: math/calculators, was; TV Voluntarily Off","postDate":"1054873521","msgId":72485,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJicDUzaCtpODhjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFlZi5hNjJkNjkwLjJjMTE1MDA1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":72447,"nextInTopic":72564,"prevInTime":72484,"nextInTime":72486,"topicId":72447,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... her ... to pub school for ... over me a ... flash cards ...
