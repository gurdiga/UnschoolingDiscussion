Why do one jot more?  (And why NOT to <br/>\ndo more is:  the other kids will shame you if you&#39;re a girl, and hit you if <br/>\nyou&#39;re a boy.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the best teachers I had I consider best simply because they DID let <br/>\nme read books when I wasn&#39;t &quot;doing my work&quot; (&quot;work&quot; meaning answering <br/>\nquestions at the ends of chapters in history and science books).  They <br/>\nweren&#39;t always great teachers, they were just benevolent jailers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same sort of damage sometimes done at schools can be done at home, too.  <br/>\nIf kids are required to sit absolutely still and quietly while mom reads, it <br/>\nwill be sooner that they don&#39;t want mom to read so much.  If kids are <br/>\nrequired to &quot;do their work&quot; by the clock and calendar instead of by their <br/>\ninterest, soon they&#39;ll learn that great &quot;how little do I have to do&quot; trick <br/>\nwhich can contribute to making such bad spouses and bad employees in the long <br/>\nrun.  If kids&#39; questions will only be answered during school hours, they&#39;ll <br/>\nlearn not to wonder and think during those off times, or they&#39;ll find someone <br/>\nsomewhere else who will answer their questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to teach Jr. High, kids who were 12 to 15.  I did then and still do <br/>\nhave vivid memories of myself at that time--of whole conversations, <br/>\nincidents, the very food at lunch and who I sat with lots of days--and I used <br/>\nto say to the other teachers sometimes, &quot;Don&#39;t you remember what it felt <br/>\nlike!?&quot; and they would almost invariably look at me and in all seriousness <br/>\nsay, &quot;No.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have friends my age with maybe one or two traumatic memories of that age <br/>\nperiod (or younger even), with maybe a vague memory of a summer camp or <br/>\nsomething, but no details, no dialog, no names and birthdays.  Trauma will do <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also used to talk to my friends, just as I do with my friends now.  I&#39;d ask <br/>\nthem why they did and thought what they did.  I&#39;d ask them about their <br/>\nparents and what they liked most about their parents and what they were <br/>\nafraid of.  I was out unschooling sociology and psychology, I guess, in <br/>\nretrospect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo now sometimes I deal with homeschoolers who don&#39;t have vivid memories of <br/>\ntheir own childhoods, nor of school, and some of whom were never analytical <br/>\nabout what teachers did and why, they just simply decided &quot;I hate it&quot; and <br/>\nthought no more deeply about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps when people have beliefs and theories and ideas to work from instead <br/>\nof patterns.
