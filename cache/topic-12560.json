There was abuse left and right and I was the one who received<br/>\n&gt;the brunt of the abuse mostly in the form of emotional and some<br/>\n&gt;physical by my father when I was a teenager. By physical I mean that<br/>\n&gt;he would taunt me till I was fuming mad and then walk away laughing.<br/>\n&gt;This was something that he did to me starting when I was very young.<br/>\n&gt;When I became a teenager I learned that I had a right to not be<br/>\n&gt;treated this way. The years of emotional abuse came out physically<br/>\n&gt;when he would do this. He was good at knowing when I had reached the<br/>\n&gt;point of physical anger and when I would walk away he would dare me<br/>\n&gt;to come back and fight him. And I did. And although my mother is from<br/>\n&gt;an abusive family as well, she was my advocate. With the problems I<br/>\n&gt;had in ps she was the one who stood up for me when I wasn&#39;t able to<br/>\n&gt;stand up for myself. In the end it was my mother who was able to<br/>\n&gt;acknowledge that she wasn&#39;t perfect and admit to me when she made a<br/>\n&gt;mistake in her parenting, and there were many mistakes, however, none<br/>\n&gt;that were as bad as what my father inflicted on me. He, by the way,<br/>\n&gt;to this day admits nothing wrong. He sees himself as infalable in<br/>\n&gt;every aspect of his life. The point I am wanting make here and<br/>\n&gt;getting off the subject of is that although I come from a family of<br/>\n&gt;abuse, somehow, someway I was able to look at what was happening to<br/>\n&gt;me and realize that it was wrong. That this isn&#39;t the way it is<br/>\n&gt;supposed to be. And then figure out how to do it better, I will even<br/>\n&gt;say right. That isn&#39;t to say that I am always right but that the<br/>\n&gt;environment that I have been able to provide for my children is<br/>\n&gt;happy, loving and not abusive. Meaning, they will never know what it<br/>\n&gt;is like to grow up with anything close to what I did. I have been<br/>\n&gt;able to figure out how to give them the type of environment I wanted<br/>\n&gt;to and deserved to grow up in. How do I know I am doing this with the<br/>\n&gt;background I just described? I used to wonder that myself. I began<br/>\n&gt;looking at what the &quot;experts&quot; say and suggest and found that I was<br/>\n&gt;already doing the majority of it. This isn&#39;t to say that I am perfect<br/>\n&gt;in my parenting skills. It is to say that I don&#39;t have the problems<br/>\n&gt;of parenting my children that most survivors of abuse do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I do apreciate your openness and your opinion. And thank you for your<br/>\n&gt;sensitivity in you last post. To be very honest I was extremely<br/>\n&gt;offended by the email you had sent.: ) however, all is forgotten. : )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am curious as to some of the things you have learned in your class<br/>\n&gt;with DH. How have you come to terms and found common ground with the<br/>\n&gt;differences you have in your childrenrearing techniques?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Corallyn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Shannon Nicoletta Manns&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;snmanns@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; BTW I did some spanking when my girls where younger, before I knew<br/>\n&gt;about Aletha Solter&#39;s work and before I joined a Self-Healing Circle.<br/>\n&gt;I wasn&#39;t judging you personally.

But I could only begin to change once I<br/>\n&gt;realized what I was doing and acknowledging it openly, while at the<br/>\n&gt;same time being gentle with myself, not beating myself up or judging<br/>\n&gt;myself. Corporal punishment is not the only type of child abuse - a<br/>\n&gt;lot of emotional abuse goes unnoticed. I have been &quot;guilty&quot; of that,<br/>\n&gt;too. Realizing that my behaviours originated in my own childhood is<br/>\n&gt;not an excuse or a reason to blame my upbringing, but a place to<br/>\n&gt;begin changing. I am working on it every day. So I would like to join<br/>\n&gt;someone else here who said &quot;try not to take it personally&quot;. I know<br/>\n&gt;that is not easy sometimes, and I see every day how &#39;taking things<br/>\n&gt;personally and getting defensive&#39; gets in way more than anything when<br/>\n&gt;it comes to opening up to change. I thank you, Corallyn, for posting<br/>\n&gt;you original message. In my emotionality I was maybe too quick to<br/>\n&gt;react by sending all the Aletha Solter info (I still think everyone<br/>\n&gt;could benefit from knowing her stuff), without acknowledging that I<br/>\n&gt;have been where you are, Corallyn, and I do hav sympathy for you and<br/>\n&gt;your situation. My husband and I recently joined a Couples&#39; Self-<br/>\n&gt;Healing Circle. It has been most valuable in helping us deal with<br/>\n&gt;some of our issues - differences in childrearing being one,<br/>\n&gt;especially since we are blended family (I have two girls from a<br/>\n&gt;previous marriage, he has a son and a daughter from two previous<br/>\n&gt;marriages and together we have Benjamin who is three). Anyway, I<br/>\n&gt;apologize for not being more sensitive to begin with. That doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;mean I feel any different or less passionate about the subject of<br/>\n&gt;spanking or other forms of punishment.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nicoletta<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sun, 03 Sep 2000 15:25:28 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Corallyn &quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hape2day@...\">hape2day@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Differences with DH<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can see that it is your opinion that it doesn&#39;t matter what the<br/>\n&gt;situation was.

There is no judgement in that...<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s just a fact... If you are the responsible one for a situation<br/>\n&gt;and something happens in that situations, then I would be apologizing<br/>\n&gt;to my son for not watching him well enough that he could get away<br/>\n&gt;from me, not hitting him for something that children do... They don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;understand at 4 yrs old they could get lost or someone could hurt<br/>\n&gt;them...They just see things that they like and off they go, which is<br/>\n&gt;why it&#39;s our job as adults to not let that happen.  But why should<br/>\n&gt;your son suffer consequences for your inability to take care of him?<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s just a thought...and one I only just thought off....It doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;make you a bad parent, just a typical reaction to the thought that<br/>\n&gt;you are not perfect and chose to take an action that wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;appropriate given the situation.  Why is it so difficult to admit a<br/>\n&gt;mistake.  Spanking a child because they ran away when it was the<br/>\n&gt;responsibility of the adult to make sure they didn&#39;t run away doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;make any logical sense to me and it certainly wouldn&#39;t make any to a<br/>\n&gt;child.

I can clearly see all sides to this particular discussion, and I <br/>\n&gt;am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so glad it has continued.  Although the subject may be uncomfortable, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think everyone seems to agree that it is one of most importantance .  It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seems to be making some progress though, where people are starting to<br/>\n&gt;listen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and therefore actually be able to affect one another.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think compassion is the key here.  I read Corallyn&#39;s initial post as<br/>\n&gt;being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; brave & quite worthy of  responses.  It is very difficult to bring up <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; discussion of discipline, and it touches on very sensitive ground for <br/>\n&gt;most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of us.  But, the only way to effectively change often involves some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; discomfort.  I am always grateful to those who are braver than I at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; broaching &#39;dangerous&#39; subjects, and I always learn something no matter <br/>\n&gt;how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much I already think I know.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, thank you to Corallyn & thank you to Nicoletta ( I appreciated both <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your posts), and thank you to everyone else who contributed to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; discussion one way or the other.  I&#39;ve been on lists where discussion <br/>\n&gt;was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shut down when things got even slightly controversial, and that level of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; censorship doesn&#39;t seem to reflect the ideas of unschooling in my mind<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyway.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I look forward to many more discussions with all of you!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cindy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; St. Louis, MO<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Shannon Nicoletta Manns&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snmanns@...\">snmanns@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, September 03, 2000 8:29 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Differences with DH<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With all this said I do respect each  person&#39;s right to their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oppinion. That doesn&#39;t mean I do/have to agree/like that opinion.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Corallyn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s right, Corallyn.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW I did some spanking when my girls where younger, before I knew <br/>\n&gt;about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aletha Solter&#39;s work and before I joined a Self-Healing Circle.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I wasn&#39;t judging you personally. However I still believe that spanking<br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; abusive. Therefore I have to admit that &quot;I used to abuse my children&quot;. <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have changed. But I could only begin to change once I realized what I<br/>\n&gt;was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing and acknowledging it openly, while at the same time being gentle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; myself, not beating myself up or judging myself. Corporal punishment <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the only type of child abuse - a lot of emotional abuse goes <br/>\n&gt;unnoticed.<br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have been &quot;guilty&quot; of that, too. Realizing that my behaviours <br/>\n&gt;originated<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my own childhood is not an excuse or a reason to blame my upbringing,<br/>\n&gt;but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; place to begin changing. I am working on it every day.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So I would like to join someone else here who said &quot;try not to take it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; personally&quot;. I know that is not easy sometimes, and I see every day <br/>\n&gt;how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;taking things personally and getting defensive&#39; gets in way more than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anything when it comes to opening up to change.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I thank you, Corallyn, for posting you original message. In my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; emotionality<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was maybe too quick to react by sending all the Aletha Solter info <br/>\n&gt;(I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; still think everyone could benefit from knowing her stuff), without<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; acknowledging that I have been where you are, Corallyn, and I do have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sympathy for you and your situation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My husband and I recently joined a Couples&#39; Self-Healing Circle. It <br/>\n&gt;has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; most valuable in helping us deal with some of our issues - differences<br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; childrearing being one, especially since we are blended family (I have<br/>\n&gt;two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; girls from a previous marriage, he has a son and a daughter from two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; previous marriages and together we have Benjamin who is three).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I apologize for not being more sensitive to begin with. That<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mean I feel any different or less passionate about the subject of<br/>\n&gt;spanking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or other forms of punishment.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nicoletta<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 16<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sun, 3 Sep 2000 14:50:46 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Pris&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:x_t_sipr@...\">x_t_sipr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Re I am so angry<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;now, there you go, that&#39;s a great way to look @ the situation and btw, you<br/>\n&gt;sound much better about things today, Marianne ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;keep your chin up :)<br/>\n&gt;Pris<br/>\n&gt;WARNING: I cannot be help responsible for the above, as apparently my cats<br/>\n&gt;have learned how to type ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tonitoni@...\">tonitoni@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Sunday, September 03, 2000 2:08 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re I am so angry<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks guys.

It applies to all 50 states.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &quot;CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT&quot;<br/>\n&gt;   The Public Law 100-294<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Defines child abuse and neglect as being any physical or mental injury,<br/>\n&gt;act of sexual abuse or exploitation, negligent treatment, or maltreatment<br/>\n&gt;of any child under the age of 18, unless the child protection law of the<br/>\n&gt;State in, which the child resides specifies a younger age for cases not<br/>\n&gt;involving sexual abuse, by a person, including any employee of a<br/>\n&gt;residential facility or any staff person providing out-of- home care, who<br/>\n&gt;is responsible for the child&#39;s welfare under circumstances, which indicate<br/>\n&gt;that the child&#39;s health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   The Act defines sexual abuse as: the use, employment, persuasion,<br/>\n&gt;inducement, enticement or coercion of any child to engage in, or assist any<br/>\n&gt;other person to engage in, any sexually explicit conduct (or any simulation<br/>\n&gt;of such conduct) for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such<br/>\n&gt;conduct, or rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual<br/>\n&gt;exploitation of children, or incest with children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   1984 Child Abuse Amendments of (P.L. 98-457)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   As a result of the above amendment to the Child Abuse Act, the act now<br/>\n&gt;also includes the withholding of medically indicated treatment for an<br/>\n&gt;infant&#39;s life-threatening conditions as child abuse.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   WHAT IS MALTREATMENT ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   The following categories basically all fit under the heading<br/>\n&gt;Maltreatment:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   PHYSICAL ABUSE<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Physical abuse is defined by inflicting any type of physical injury by<br/>\n&gt;punching, slapping, hitting, beating, kicking, biting, arm twisting, hair<br/>\n&gt;pulling, burning, or otherwise harming a child. The parent or care giver<br/>\n&gt;may not have intended to hurt the child and injury may have resulted from<br/>\n&gt;over-discipline or physical punishment that is inappropriate to the child&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;age. However, it is still abuse. Any physical act causing harm to a child<br/>\n&gt;is abuse whether it was intended or not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   CHILD NEGLECT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Child neglect is defined by failure on the parents or care givers part <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;provide for the child&#39;s basic needs, food, water, shelter, clothing and so<br/>\n&gt;on. Child neglect can be a combination of the following: physical,<br/>\n&gt;educational, or emotional or can be just one alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   The latest national incidence study defines these three types of neglect<br/>\n&gt;as follows.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   PHYSICAL NEGLECT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Physical neglect includes refusal of or delay in seeking health care or<br/>\n&gt;emergency medical services, abandonment, kicking an under aged child out of<br/>\n&gt;the home. Not allowing a runaway to return home. Inadequate supervision,<br/>\n&gt;leaving the child unattended for long periods of time. Leaving an under<br/>\n&gt;aged child home alone to be responsible for younger siblings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   EDUCATIONAL NEGLECT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Educational neglect includes allowing your school aged child to commit<br/>\n&gt;the act of chronic truancy, failure to enroll a child of mandatory school<br/>\n&gt;age, every child has the right to education and should be in school<br/>\n&gt;according to your states guidelines. Inattention to a special educational<br/>\n&gt;need, such as knowing your child is in need of special education classes<br/>\n&gt;and doing nothing about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   EMOTIONAL NEGLECT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Emotional neglect includes such actions as chronic or extreme spouse<br/>\n&gt;abuse in the child&#39;s presence. Knowledge of drug or alcohol use by the<br/>\n&gt;child, or permission. Refusal of or failure to allow or provide needed<br/>\n&gt;psychological care.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   It is extremely important to distinguish between willful neglect and a<br/>\n&gt;parent&#39;s or caretaker&#39;s failure to provide necessities of life because of<br/>\n&gt;poverty or cultural norms. Say for example, willful neglect is acts that<br/>\n&gt;call for Child Protective Services intervention. Whereas, if a parent who<br/>\n&gt;is unable to provide the necessities of life due to poverty may, instead,<br/>\n&gt;seek assistance from the governmental agencies charged with providing<br/>\n&gt;financial assistance, health services, housing, or other basic services.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   EMOTIONAL ABUSE<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Emotional abuse includes but is not limited to: Screaming, yelling,<br/>\n&gt;belittling, name calling, emotional detachment, lack of love and affection,<br/>\n&gt;scapegoating, such as blaming the child for the adults problems or<br/>\n&gt;financial state.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   As you&#39;ve seen there are many forms of child maltreatment more often <br/>\n&gt;than<br/>\n&gt;not we find them occurring in combinations. Emotional/psychological will<br/>\n&gt;most likely always be present as well. Emotional abuse and neglect includes<br/>\n&gt;acts or omissions by the parents, guardians or any other person responsible<br/>\n&gt;for the child&#39;s care that have caused, or could possibly cause, serious<br/>\n&gt;behavioral, emotional, or mental disorders.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   In some cases of emotional/psychological abuse the acts of parents or<br/>\n&gt;other caretakers alone, without any harm evident in the child&#39;s behavior or<br/>\n&gt;condition, such as parents, guardian or care givers use excessive, extreme<br/>\n&gt;even sometimes bizarre forms of punishment, such as torture, or locking a<br/>\n&gt;child in a dark closet. These also are sufficient to warrant the<br/>\n&gt;intervention of Child Protective Services.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         LinkExchange Member Free Home Pages at GeoCities<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Please be kind and sign the guest book before leaving.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   This page was updated on: 29 June 1997<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   What Is Child Abuse & Neglect� is a trademark of CAWSCORP, Inc.<br/>\n&gt;   Copyright 1997.

That presents a picture of going beyond a mere spanking and<br/>\n&gt;certainly far beyond a swat on the fanny.  And the only reason that one<br/>\n&gt;could have for pulling down the pants and hitting the bare bottom is to<br/>\n&gt;make the experience more painful.  I have no problem with someone getting a<br/>\n&gt;wake-up call such as a swift swat on their sitting down end or even a<br/>\n&gt;couple of swift ones with their clothing on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The experience of having the pants pulled down is one which creates a<br/>\n&gt;feeling of defenselessness, embarassment and degredation of self-esteem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, I am sure that there are other folks on the list that feel the same<br/>\n&gt;as I do, children do not belong to us, they are simply put into our care<br/>\n&gt;and they are not a sub species, they are simply SMALL people.  I would not<br/>\n&gt;expect an adult to have their pants pulled down and get a beating,<br/>\n&gt;therefore I do not do that to a child simply because they are smaller and I<br/>\n&gt;have them in my power.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But what was the real clincher were a few other statements that you made.<br/>\n&gt;Namely that your hubby feels they need a switch taken to them, that now is<br/>\n&gt;the time to begin using a switch (like there is some rule written that says<br/>\n&gt;at a certain age we begin using objects to hit children with) and you<br/>\n&gt;repeated saying that you would probably do it again.  It was the sum total<br/>\n&gt;of what you did added to what you said and what you said you would still<br/>\n&gt;do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lynda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Corallyn  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hape2day@...\">hape2day@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Differences with DH<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Date: Sunday, September 03, 2000 8:25 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can see that it is your opinion that it doesn&#39;t matter what the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; situation was.

Mum used to clean, and my big sis<br/>\n&gt;babysit (I don&#39;t think we ever got sat on, but I couldn&#39;t swear to<br/>\n&gt;that) for a neighbour of ours, and I used to go too.  Well this<br/>\n&gt;woman had painted, in big red letters &#39;Don&#39;t let the b******s grind<br/>\n&gt;you down!!!&#39; on her magnolia living room walls.  I took the<br/>\n&gt;daughter of the house to get the can of paint, got it down, but it<br/>\n&gt;fell, and got EVERYWHERE!!!  Well, we tried to clean it up, but<br/>\n&gt;failed (I need to explain that my babysitting big sis was asleep at<br/>\n&gt;this time) and went to the bathroom to clean ourselves.  And<br/>\n&gt;accidentally made handprints (bright red paint, remember?) all the<br/>\n&gt;way up the wall.  We were still upstairs when Mum came in, and<br/>\n&gt;the front door opened onto the stairway, so she saw all these<br/>\n&gt;handprints and thought someone had been slaughtered!  There<br/>\n&gt;was paint everywhere.
