The only thing I still have too many of is pictures and books,<br/>\nbut everything else is under control. My hubby is a neat freak who has won<br/>\nme over slowly but surely and weaned me off of my packrat ways. I come from<br/>\na long line of packrats though. We just spent the weekend at my mom&#39;s house<br/>\n(ugh!) and this cracked me up: she said to my son &quot;Don&#39;t step on that pile<br/>\nof magazines. Do you just stand all over the magazines at your own house?&quot;<br/>\nIn my mind I&#39;m thinking &quot;No mom, because we don&#39;t HAVE piles of magazines<br/>\nall over our house&quot;, honestly, the word &quot;childproofing&quot; means nothing to<br/>\nher, she has piles of stuff everywhere and I have a 16 month old - ack!. My<br/>\ngrandma&#39;s house is worse. She can no longer use one of her bathrooms because<br/>\nit is full of stuff, and hasn&#39;t eaten a  meal on her dining room table in at<br/>\nleast 15 years, it&#39;s been buried in stuff.
