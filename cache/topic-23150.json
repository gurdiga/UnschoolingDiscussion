It is a<br/>\nlittle bit hard to pick up advanced math in everyday life...<br/>\nNow, if he was interested in Physics and went off and picked up books and<br/>\nthings like that to learn about physics to prepare for the college courses,<br/>\nthats great.  And if he was informed one way or another that advanced math<br/>\nwill be needed to achieve his goals, then he may have wanted to learn about<br/>\nmath, or decide it isn&#39;t worth the effort.  If he wanted to learn math, he<br/>\nwould have to pick up some books and figure it out.<br/>\nWhat I am saying is that if a child is interested in something, one should<br/>\nfacilitate the learning in that area.  Does that make sense? If my daughter<br/>\nis interested in becoming a doctor, I&#39;ll probably say, &quot;well, lets go figure<br/>\nout what it is a doctor needs to know&quot; and point her in the right direction<br/>\nfor her research, and then she&#39;ll have to decide the best way for her to<br/>\nlearn that information.<br/>\nIf my daughter is interested in the arts or biology or becoming an auto<br/>\nmechanic, then I would do the exact same thing.  But she would probably have<br/>\nto learn a minimal amount of formal math for any of those (knowing the names<br/>\nof some of the statistical processes would be helpful for Biology, for<br/>\nexample.).  I&#39;m not saying one should sit the kids down and learn it, I&#39;m<br/>\njust saying that a person needs to know some things if they are going to<br/>\nwant to become some things, or go to college to become some things.  And I<br/>\ndo believe that children will pick up on most of it on their own if they<br/>\nhave the resources to explore, but if a more intense knowledge is going to<br/>\nbe needed in a particular area in order to reach their goals, they may need<br/>\nto focus on that area so they can continue with what it is their interested<br/>\nin.<br/>\nWe&#39;re a very science-oriented family so this is why I feel this way.  I know<br/>\nwith my husband&#39;s Physics degree and what he eventually wants to do with it,<br/>\nhe needed a formal college education.  I know with what I am working towards<br/>\n(I am a life-long student... but my goal is Environmental Studies though I<br/>\nstarted out wanting to be a paleontologist) I need to know certain things.<br/>\nI know I can learn most of it on my own, if I wanted to, but because I do<br/>\nnot have the background or foundation in certain areas (math and chemistry)<br/>\nI am going to have to go back and learn it.  If I had been shown a long time<br/>\nago (like early teens) that this was stuff that would be good to know to<br/>\nfulfil my dreams, it would have been good information to know and I may (or<br/>\nmay not have) taken the time to learn those things that would help me later<br/>\nin life.<br/>\nDoes this make any sense? Or am I totally rambling?<br/>\nI thought that unschooling was basically being your child&#39;s facilitator.  If<br/>\nthey are interested in something, you point them in the right direction or<br/>\nfind the resources they need.  If they really want to do something that<br/>\nrequires knowledge in other areas, why would you not show them these other<br/>\nthings?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kristi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lite2yu@...\">lite2yu@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lite2yu@...\">lite2yu@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, August 12, 2001 9:07 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Unschooling math etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 8/12/2001 11:39:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mom@...\">mom@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; learn about without learning about physics<br/>\n&gt; specifically, but at some point when the child grows, if the interest is<br/>\n&gt; still there (or in engineering, biology, computers, business, etc, etc,<br/>\n&gt; etc), and the child is seriously interested in pursuing this in life,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>she/he<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is going to have to learn some math, and that math is going to have to be<br/>\n&gt; learned as math.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who says?
