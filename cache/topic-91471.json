They, too, have a roof over their heads, regular meals and <br/>\nentertainment provided for them, but they are not free to go out. But <br/>\nchildren are not criminals.&quot; <br/>\nThe &quot;battery&quot; lives he describes today&#39;s children as living are in <br/>\nclear contrast to his own free-range childhood. ......<br/>\n&quot;..we learned the meaning of taking risks and its consequences, <br/>\nsomething that is increasingly denied this generation of children. <br/>\nThey&#39;ll therefore be at more risk later, because they have no <br/>\nexperience to fall back on, no coping mechanisms that they&#39;ve <br/>\ndeveloped through slight accidents and injuries.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n***************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nWOW!<br/>\n<br/>\nI could not agree more!  All these years, while I was getting dirty looks from other parents because I gave my children a &quot;free range&quot; childhood, I just knew there was something more important at stake.  I couldn&#39;t have told you what it was, but this is it!  I had a free range childhood too, and I wouldn&#39;t trade it for the world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have always truly pitied children who have to have constant supervision, have no means for carving out their own space in the world at any age.  I understand the fears, I really do.  But there again, its about choosing to live in fear when the risks are not really kept in perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live near a railroad and a river.  There is a line of woods between the river and our home.  The railroad runs through the woods.  In spite of the dangers, it is a PERFECT place to explore, play, pretend, have fun, whatever.  Its great for forts, campfires, sleepouts, and swims in the creeks that come off the river.  There are trails and other fun stuff.  One trail runs the whole way to a place we own along the river about 1-2 miles away.  And the trail continues even further up the river than that.  Its got neat bridges and stuff too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the other direction is an abandoned mining town and a quarry full of water.  It is absolutely beautiful.  My oldest likes to hike down there with his older friend.  They take pictures, watch the stars at night, and talk about the history of the abandoned town.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrestled with myself when they were younger about whether or not to let them go without me.  And for a long time I didn&#39;t.  But when they got to be about 10, I&#39;d let them go in groups of friends.  And I sent a cell phone along, in case they needed me. I figured it was a good compromise.  I had a way to stay in contact, they had easy access to help, and they could still roam freely.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they were little, I taught them that if they go into the river, never to go in above their knees unless an adult was right there with them.  (That way the current could not knock them off their feet.  Can&#39;t rely on landmarks with fluctuating river depths).  I taught them never to swim alone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI taught them never to rely on the sound of a train whistle at your back in the summer, because the greenery would asorb the sound, and they likely woudn&#39;t hear it.  (I found that out when I was young, free ranging on a RR bridge.  I turned around and there was a train and I was trapped.  I had to run as fast as I could to get off the bridge.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause they&#39;ve *been* out in the river (with us), they know the dangers of hidden rocks, how slippery it is, and how fast the current can get.   They&#39;ve seen the trains go by.  They know how fast they can be.  In fact, they&#39;ve learned to read the signals now so they know when a train is approaching.  They taught that to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I just can&#39;t imagine depriving them of this rich and wonderful place to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":170863101,"authorName":"sblingle@aol.com","from":"sblingle@...","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: climbing -- was Continuum concept and unschoo...","postDate":"1077810232","msgId":91473,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRiLjNhN2UwY2M0LjJkNmY2ZTM4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":91472,"nextInTopic":91475,"prevInTime":91472,"nextInTime":91474,"topicId":91471,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/26/2004 7:40:18 AM Pacific Standard Time, ...

About how kids are being <br/>\nmore and more confined...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat De says about  children killed by cars in the USA mirrors  the <br/>\nsituation in the UK  where road &#39;accidents&#39; are the major cause of <br/>\ndeath amongst children under 16 but of course it isnt even news. <br/>\nMedia hysteria  is reserved for  the occasional child  abduction and <br/>\nknows no bounds, rivalling only by the press&#39;s persistent campaigning <br/>\nto  get speed cameras removed and for relaxation of penalties for the <br/>\nspeeding by motorists - those who are the cause of so many child <br/>\ndeaths and who when not actually killing nevertheless bring about the <br/>\nclimate of risk and danger thus  leading to  children not being <br/>\nallowed to play unsupervised outside in their own streets. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we have it proclaimed in the London Times the other  <br/>\nthat &quot;parents who allow their children to ride a bicycle in London <br/>\nshould be locked up&quot; . Cycling advocacy groups are already on the <br/>\ncase :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNatural parental instincts to protect our children are  manipulated <br/>\nso that we can be ignorant  of the long term harm  caused to  <br/>\nchildren by blocking their developmental needs, cocooning and over-<br/>\nprotecting them, rendering them incapable to handle the risks they&#39;ll <br/>\nface in life, or unable to expand their geographical horizons, <br/>\nencouraging sedentary habits and the tendency to obesity, etc the <br/>\nlist could go on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMayer Hillman says it all much better:-<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;.... Hillman it was (along with John Adams and John Whitelegg) <br/>\nwhose massively influential 1991 One False Move... A Study Of <br/>\nChildren&#39;s Independent Mobility, alerted us to the reduction in <br/>\nchildren&#39;s freedom because of the increase in traffic. While in 1971, <br/>\n80% of seven- and eight-year-old children went to school on their <br/>\nown, by 1990 only 9% were making the journey unaccompanied, with more <br/>\nthan four times as many seven- to 11-year-olds being driven in 1990 <br/>\ncompared with 20 years earlier. .....<br/>\n. Roads are now such perilous places that fearful parents have <br/>\ndramatically curtailed their children&#39;s right to navigate them <br/>\nindependently. As a result, parents (for which read - mostly - <br/>\nmothers) have taken to driving them, thereby putting more cars on the <br/>\nroad, and so increasing the danger - as well as maternal exhaustion. <br/>\n(While this latter won&#39;t perturb governments unduly, they may be <br/>\nexercised by the fact that escorting kids took up 900 million hours <br/>\nin 1990 - and has surely risen exponentially since then - annually <br/>\ncosting the economy some £20bn.) .......<br/>\n.......His take on &quot;stranger danger&quot; is also fresh. &quot;Far more people <br/>\nare killed by strangers behind the steering wheel of a motor vehicle <br/>\nthan are killed by strangers on foot. Danger should be removed from <br/>\nchildren rather than children from danger.&quot; In reality, the opposite <br/>\nis happening, with vulnerable road users such as children affected by <br/>\nthe so-called &quot;improved&quot; performance of cars, which enables drivers <br/>\nto accelerate to higher speeds in fewer seconds. <br/>\nDown the years, Hillman has charted the vast repercussions of the <br/>\ngrowth of motorised transport. &quot;Normal carelessness in children is <br/>\nnow considered blame-worthy. And though the outdoor environment <br/>\ncontains experience, learning opportunities and stimuli that are <br/>\ncrucial to children&#39;s understanding of the real world, it&#39;s now out <br/>\nof bounds to them until they reach an increasingly advanced age in <br/>\ntheir childhood. It&#39;s salutary that, when children do obtain <br/>\nparental &#39;licence&#39; to travel on their own, there are fewer outdoor <br/>\nand public spaces for their social and recreational activity owing to <br/>\nthe appropriation of streets for traffic.&quot; <br/>\nHe makes a shocking analogy. &quot;Children&#39;s lives have been evolving in <br/>\na way that mirrors the characteristics of the lives of criminals in <br/>\nprison. They, too, have a roof over their heads, regular meals and <br/>\nentertainment provided for them, but they are not free to go out. But <br/>\nchildren are not criminals.&quot; <br/>\nThe &quot;battery&quot; lives he describes today&#39;s children as living are in <br/>\nclear contrast to his own free-range childhood. ......<br/>\n&quot;..we learned the meaning of taking risks and its consequences, <br/>\nsomething that is increasingly denied this generation of children. <br/>\nThey&#39;ll therefore be at more risk later, because they have no <br/>\nexperience to fall back on, no coping mechanisms that they&#39;ve <br/>\ndeveloped through slight accidents and injuries.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nif everyone owned a car, what a smelly, dangerous, noisy, stressful, <br/>\nunhealthy, expensive society this would be... oh, wait... it is! <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91458,"nextTopicId":91468}}
