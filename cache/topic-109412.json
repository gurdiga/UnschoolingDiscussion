She came out of K where she basically &quot;read&quot; an easy reader weekly and &quot;moved up&quot;.  She was memorizing.  The phonics and other &quot;tools&quot; made no sense to her.  This frustrated her.  <br/>\nWe stopped doing any &quot;required&quot; stuff and it was 3 years before she would &quot;try&quot; to read.  Phonics still doesn&#39;t make any sense to her but...<br/>\nThis year she WILL try to read (instructions, notes, recipes and even books :) and WILL write notes and WILL play with words. She is no longer intimidated by written symbols.<br/>\nI read to her and she listens to tapes/CDs with the family.  Still, this is not her favorite information resource. <br/>\nShe can now read a &quot;Little Critter&quot; book.  She reads large words but mainly in context.  I know that she would likely not get half of them on flash cards. She uses picture clues and guesses and sometimes tries to sound things out, but not much.<br/>\nShould I sit her down and make her memorize a list daily?  NO!<br/>\nI tell others &quot;her reading skills are emerging&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 3 kids.  2 are reading.  2 learned while they were &quot;in school&quot;.<br/>\nI can see the methods/tools which they used most.  My oldest son came through a &quot;whole language&quot; program, with us sneaking in the phonics part.  He still just mainly memorized words.  Much of his class had &quot;remedial training&quot; when they were in 4th grade.   He did not need it.  He is very visual with an almost photographic memory, so he could do this.<br/>\nMy middle son (who is very auditory) depended more on the sounds/pattern/flow of the words.  He is very &quot;verbally aware&quot;. Not sure which Gardner intelligence that is : ) <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that my daughter will just continue to gradually add more words to her list until it clicks.  She will &quot;hit the ground running&quot; with a huge vocabulary from the world around her.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;She was supposed to read early like I did and like other girls do.&quot;<br/>\n   ****I have gotten over this. Not ALL do!<br/>\n&quot;She is supposed to love reading like I do.&quot;<br/>\n  ****She still may.  She has a better chance now than when she was in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is her own person,  learning in her own way.<br/>\nShe can add numbers in her head that many adults can&#39;t.  <br/>\nShe loves Shakespeare movies and has no trouble understanding the original prose. <br/>\nShe knows people learn in different ways and on different time tables.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy job is to help her when she wants help and otherwise, stay out of her way.<br/>\nMy job is to provide her with a rich environment.<br/>\nSupport HER!  Encourage HER!  Celebrate HER!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI will do NOTHING to make her hate reading. I will do NOTHING to harm our relationship<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth (learning from my kids) in MD.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109408,"nextTopicId":109326}}
