I am 29 years old and am expecting","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-423159758\">Merry Meet to all!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My name is Shelly and I live in Connecticut with my husband, 4 kids, 2 <br/>\ndogs, 1 cat a frog and a fish. I am 29 years old and am expecting baby #5 <br/>\nmid November.Our kids are 10,7,6, & 4.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We had decided to homeschool back in 1990 but family really gave us a hard <br/>\ntime so we tried public and then private schools before pulling our kids out <br/>\nin March&#39;98. We had planned to let the kids finish the year while we <br/>\ninvestigate how we wanted to homeschool them but a knife brought to my <br/>\ndaughters class and threats made us pull our children out on the spot from <br/>\nthe Catholic school they were in.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I finished their year doing what they wanted to do and having fun building <br/>\nterriums and exploring the woods when we went on hikes. In the fall we began <br/>\nto use Oak meadow curriculum and I have to admit I struggled to try and get <br/>\neverything done in a week. Some weeks we did others we didnt. Mid way there <br/>\nthe year I decieded we could pick and choose what we wanted to do and things <br/>\nhave gone easier for all of us. I dont plan on using a curriculum next year <br/>\nand am just looking for good reading books and maybe some math books to use. <br/>\nI am required to do a portfolio rewiew at the end of the year and must have <br/>\nsome examples of required subjects that were taught. I like the idea of <br/>\nunschooling and really want to do it but I am honestly not sure how to meet <br/>\nthe school boards needs and do unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am currently reading John Holt&#39;s &quot;Learning All the Time&quot; and am looking <br/>\nto do some more reading on the subject of unschooling this summer.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think my main problem is not comparing my kids. I never have compared <br/>\nthem with other kids outside our home but I worry about my 2 middle ones. My <br/>\noldest Brittney who is 10 learned to read on her own at 5. She just loves <br/>\nbooks! It is her favorite way to spend her time and always has been. her <br/>\nBrother Nathan who is 7 likes to read but struggles. I do think this is left <br/>\nover from school as he hates to write and is constantly worrying about <br/>\nmispelling a word. Chelsea who is 6 is just starting to show she wants to <br/>\nread and is trying. I guess I worry what is the right age and do worry they <br/>\nwill be embarrassed if they go to a function where other kids their age are <br/>\nalready reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think that is my only concern is about math and reading. We do so many <br/>\nother things to learn science and social studies that I know my kids are <br/>\nthrieving. I suppose in time I will learn to trust.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well I have rambled on her. I look forward to learning from everyone on <br/>\nthe list!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nShelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.

I am 29 years old and am expecting baby #5<br/>\n&gt; mid November.Our kids are 10,7,6, & 4.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   We had decided to homeschool back in 1990 but family really gave us a hard<br/>\n&gt; time so we tried public and then private schools before pulling our kids out<br/>\n&gt; in March&#39;98. We had planned to let the kids finish the year while we <br/>\n&gt; investigate how we wanted to homeschool them but a knife brought to my <br/>\n&gt; daughters class and threats made us pull our children out on the spot from<br/>\n&gt; the Catholic school they were in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I finished their year doing what they wanted to do and having fun building<br/>\n&gt; terriums and exploring the woods when we went on hikes. In the fall we began<br/>\n&gt; to use Oak meadow curriculum and I have to admit I struggled to try and get<br/>\n&gt; everything done in a week. Some weeks we did others we didnt. Mid way there<br/>\n&gt; the year I decieded we could pick and choose what we wanted to do and things<br/>\n&gt; have gone easier for all of us. I dont plan on using a curriculum next year<br/>\n&gt; and am just looking for good reading books and maybe some math books to use.<br/>\n&gt; I am required to do a portfolio rewiew at the end of the year and must have<br/>\n&gt; some examples of required subjects that were taught. I like the idea of<br/>\n&gt; unschooling and really want to do it but I am honestly not sure how to meet<br/>\n&gt; the school boards needs and do unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I am currently reading John Holt&#39;s &quot;Learning All the Time&quot; and am looking<br/>\n&gt; to do some more reading on the subject of unschooling this summer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I think my main problem is not comparing my kids. I never have compared<br/>\n&gt; them with other kids outside our home but I worry about my 2 middle ones. My<br/>\n&gt; oldest Brittney who is 10 learned to read on her own at 5. She just loves<br/>\n&gt; books! It is her favorite way to spend her time and always has been. her<br/>\n&gt; Brother Nathan who is 7 likes to read but struggles. I do think this is left<br/>\n&gt; over from school as he hates to write and is constantly worrying about <br/>\n&gt; mispelling a word. Chelsea who is 6 is just starting to show she wants to<br/>\n&gt; read and is trying. I guess I worry what is the right age and do worry they<br/>\n&gt; will be embarrassed if they go to a function where other kids their age are<br/>\n&gt; already reading.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I think that is my only concern is about math and reading. We do so many<br/>\n&gt; other things to learn science and social studies that I know my kids are<br/>\n&gt; thrieving. I suppose in time I will learn to trust.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Well I have rambled on her. I look forward to learning from everyone on<br/>\n&gt; the list!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Blessings,<br/>\n&gt; Shelly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
