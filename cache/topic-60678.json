But I had friends whose parents would <br/>\nmake me eat certain things---and drink MILK------EEEEYEEEWW! <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I *was* a member of the &quot;Clean Plate Club&quot;---all those starving children <br/>\nin China, ya&#39; know!. I didn&#39;t have to eat anything I didn&#39;t care for--- but I <br/>\nDID have to eat what was in front of me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI babysat for people who force fed their children---and made ME an <br/>\naccomplice! THAT&#39;S when I decided I would never do it. I saw so many children <br/>\nmade to eat---and just chew and chew and chew, never swallowing. Suppertime <br/>\nwould last for HOURS! When Cameron was a baby I refused to get caught up in <br/>\nthat, just KNOWING that he would be a picky eater. WRONG! That child has <br/>\nalways eaten everything he&#39;s ever tried! Go figure!
