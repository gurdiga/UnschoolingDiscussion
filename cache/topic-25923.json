He <br/>\nloved the water and then came the lessons.  They dunked him under the water <br/>\nrepeatedly to &quot;help&quot; him not be afraid of the water (which he wasn&#39;t afraid <br/>\nof before the lessons).  Took him out of the lessons and it took him at least <br/>\na year before he became unafraid of going into the water.  He took his arm <br/>\nbands off at nearly 5 and has been swimming ever since.  Although I wonder <br/>\nwhat damage I did to our relationship by submitting him to this torture.  <br/>\nChild #2 no lessons and I won&#39;t be getting any for him.  He&#39;s in a vest at <br/>\nnearly 2 and swims around on his own and doesn&#39;t even want to be held.  He&#39;s <br/>\nconfident and pushes me away in the water so he can be on his own.  No doubt <br/>\nthat he has more confidence because of no swimming lessons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also thought more about the whole idea of involving kids in things.  It <br/>\nseems as soon as they are born there are Gymboree Classes, Parks and Rec <br/>\nClasses, Baby Tot Programs, YMCA Programs, Baby Day at the Zoo etc etc... THe <br/>\nlist is endless...
