We have an eclectic collection of music cds.  Sometime none of us want to listen to what either one of us want to listen to.  At their last<br/>\nbirthday, the twins found a solution to our dilemma.  They bought each other  walkman-cd players.  Then, I got one too... Last Friday, after a full day of activities, everyone sat in the living room<br/>\nreading and listening to a cd of their choice on their own player.<br/>\nYou could say, we were all wired... in peace.  We love music, possibly only as much as books.<br/>\nI have been eliminating gadgets and useless junks these days, but I realized the cd players have become quite useful.<br/>\nFriendship, from Ottawa<br/>\nLucie<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PSoroosh@...\">PSoroosh@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; In a message dated 8/26/2002 9:01:23 AM Pacific Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I listen to (but don&#39;t enjoy) all the music they listen to.
