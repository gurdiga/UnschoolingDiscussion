If the topic I most wanted to know about in the world was only available in that ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1313067392\">I am repulsed, personally, by the series of Whatever for Dummies books.    If <br/>\nthe topic I most wanted to know about in the world was only available in that <br/>\nformat, I wouldn&#39;t buy the book.   I know I haven&#39;t put a dent in their <br/>\nprofits. &lt;g&gt;   It&#39;s personal.   I think people having been called and having <br/>\nthought of themselves as &quot;dumb&quot; is deeply sad and pervasive in our culture, from <br/>\nschools, from parents, from other kids, neighbors, relatives, strangers.    <br/>\nHaving it in dark black on yellow bookcovers in nice bookstores makes it worse.    <br/>\n&quot;Come buy this, you DUMMY!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI might be the only one who feels that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nUndoubtedly there are millions of people who have bought a book or two from <br/>\nthat series who are confident and whole and never even in their moments of <br/>\nhalf-sleepfulness think they&#39;re dummies in any way.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo because of all that personal emotional swirl, I believe there are probably <br/>\nsome people who respond viscerally to the titles of &quot;What your Third Grader <br/>\nNeeds to Know&quot; and its setmates.   I don&#39;t have an adverse reaction, because <br/>\nI&#39;ve never had &quot;a third grader&quot; and I&#39;m clear, waking and sleeping, that there&#39;s <br/>\nmore in the world than anyone can ever know, and my kids are getting all they <br/>\nneed and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also lived and shared the idea that not finishing something is PERFECT, <br/>\nthat dropping projects or setting them on shelves or back burners or in <br/>\ntrashbins is way okay.   So the idea of &quot;a checklist&quot; doesn&#39;t act as an anchor on my <br/>\nsoul either.   I really like magazine articles like &quot;fifty ways to find more <br/>\nstorage in your kitchen&quot; or &quot;the ten most important movies of all time&quot; or <br/>\nwhatever.   I just like them for fun, not as tests or measures.   And a list of <br/>\nwhat kindergarteners need to know is just another one of those for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had to choose betwee the Hirsch books and our South Park videos and CDs, <br/>\nI&#39;d keep South Park.   But I don&#39;t have to choose, so I&#39;m keeping both.    I <br/>\ndon&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; read, watch, care about, learn or finish any of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108337,"nextTopicId":108346}}
