Right now he is teaching snowboarding and loving it and <br/>\nthat could end up being a part of his life forever, maybe he will always teach <br/>\nsnowboarding, but maybe not. Maybe he will teach this year and maybe next but <br/>\nwho knows? Maybe he will eventually quit teaching it and just enjoy the sport <br/>\nhimself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is also enrolled to start a workshop on mixing music at the beginning of <br/>\nFebruary as he is very into music and this kind of thing. Maybe he will bump <br/>\ninto his life&#39;s passion at this workshop, maybe not.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has also landed a part in a musical being put on by a local children&#39;s <br/>\ntheater company. Maybe one day he will be on Broadway, maybe he will become <br/>\ninterested in becoming a director or a light technician or maybe none of these or <br/>\nmaybe something I have not even mentioned or thought of.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I see is that all of these opportunities are unique and life expanding. <br/>\nAs the one who facilitates, offers and arranges these experiences I only know <br/>\nthe things that I see. I see the immediate learning opportunities involved in <br/>\neach and I am also aware of many of the more less apparent ones. It is after <br/>\nand beyond these that I think the magic begins, that is where I have to let go <br/>\nand trust that there are a hundred other options out there waiting to happen <br/>\nthat I can only dream of, most I will never know that happen. Probably a good <br/>\nmany will not become evident for years to come. I liken it to reading a book, <br/>\neven if we all read the same book we are each going to come away with something <br/>\ndifferent if even ever so slightly. That is how I see my part in this, I just <br/>\nkeep trying to look for ways to allow my kids to taste life in as many <br/>\ndifferent situations as I can, not knowing when or where the magic happens but <br/>\ntrusting that it does.<br/>\nOh, and I&#39;ll be the first to admit that I love doing what I do.<br/>\nLaura Buoni<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89918,"nextTopicId":89890}}
