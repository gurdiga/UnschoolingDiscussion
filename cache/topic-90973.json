It&#39;s hard though because I&#39;m trying to not be suspicious and everything..I&#39;ve heard so many stories of kids being taken for stupid stuff...but I also talked with my lawyer and he says he thinks it&#39;s a good idea to at least try and see...Paul&#39;s duty weeks are an awfully long time to be on my own with them with absolutely no relief. Not that I&#39;m totally without anyone to help me, but to a degree I am because my friend is a single mom of 4 of her own and busy with them and work...<br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\nMelissa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:melissa4123@...\">melissa4123@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Elizabeth Roberts <br/>\n&lt;mamabethuscg@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;So since Social Services is offering help, I&#39;m taking it.

However, toxic neighbor is about out of our lives...we spent monday and today running her around and now she has her driver&#39;s license again and her own working vehicle!! YAY!!! To celebrate tomorrow, we are going to go to an indoor play-place I just found out about earlier today during Megan&#39;s Early Intervention playtime. Or maybe we&#39;ll wait until monday because I&#39;m thinking that none of us really want to go anywhere for a couple days! We might just put on our jackets and rediscover the fact that we have a backyard LOL (the weather here has been a &quot;warm&quot; 40 lately).<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s not been the easiest thing in the world, but I think posting here has helped me to honestly look at things and realize that I could really use an extra hand around once in awhile when Paul is on duty. I&#39;m relying on Sarah too much, and that&#39;s not good for either of us. So since Social Services is offering help, I&#39;m taking it. I&#39;ll have someone coming in once a week for a couple hours to play with the kids so that I can shower, or run to the grocery store, or clean something, or just go sit on the porch with a cup of tea for a minute....<br/>\n <br/>\nI really haven&#39;t been taking care of myself, and that&#39;s affecting the kids...so I&#39;ve joined a local gym with childcare; bought contact lenses again and some new clothes, and overall I&#39;m just doing  better than before. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;re ALL doing better than before really. We joined the local children&#39;s museum (with reciprocal memberships to other museums) and like I said before we found out that there&#39;s a local indoor playground type place we can go to. The kids like the childcare room at the gym, and between it, the children&#39;s museum, the indoor playground...and a couple local playgroups for the little ones...the cabin fever is lessening, and they&#39;re also enjoying having more things of theirs easily accesible to play. I&#39;m hardly ever on the computer anymore because I&#39;m really starting to enjoy playing with them again, which is also nice. <br/>\n <br/>\nSO anyway..just wanted to check in and say hello to everyone! <br/>\n <br/>\nOh..and my purple flute came in yesterday!
