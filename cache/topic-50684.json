I was laughing out there in the rain in my <br/>\nnightgown, talking to myself because I knew there was no way my 72 year old <br/>\nneighbor would hear me through her stucco walls.  And then I just figured I&#39;d <br/>\ngo slowly and if I fell it wouldn&#39;t be so far to fall or so hard.  Plus, I <br/>\nknew I could get up again after the fall that broke my ankle.  So, before <br/>\ndoing my arabesque again, I had a giggling fit over the image of me dragging <br/>\nmyself in on my ass in my nightgown and then bumping back up the stairs to <br/>\nget good fitting to stand up again.
