I&#39;m sure you are planning to continue being with <br/>\nyour child each and every day. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re planning to continue to read <br/>\nto her and answer her questions. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re planning to play with her, <br/>\ntake her places and show her lots of cool new stuff. That&#39;s the plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might even take a moment to feel a little smug that you didn&#39;t stop <br/>\nthese supportive learning moments for a &quot;summer break&quot;. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re <br/>\nplanning to continue unschooling 24/7. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I felt the same way.  When she learned to swim on her own, it was a big <br/>\n&gt;&gt;relief for me.  Also, some ammunition to use when people ask, &quot;she&#39;s not <br/>\n&gt;&gt;going to school?  How will she learn?&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t you just sometimes feel like laughing when whe people say that? I mean <br/>\nreally. How will she learn?! Are they kidding?!<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40993,"nextTopicId":41043}}
