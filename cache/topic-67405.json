Joe and I<br/>\nhide them about 2 a.m. What a sight that is with us in our jammies out in<br/>\nthe dark!!! Anyway, we hid this last Easter about 100 eggs. All 4 kids hunt.<br/>\nTara usually helps Alyssa. I mark all the eggs with one initial as all 4<br/>\nkids have different first letter names. They are only to pick up eggs with<br/>\ntheir initial on them. Alyssa&#39;s eggs are easier to find and of course Joe<br/>\nhides Tara&#39;s which means she usually needs a ladder!! I find little super<br/>\nballs, stickers, money and other trinkets for the 3 younger children. No<br/>\ncandy. We always have candy here and that&#39;s no new thing. For Tara I find<br/>\nlittle nail polish bottles or lip gloss or even underwear works well in the<br/>\neggs. (she wears thongs) Then I get a few big things for the smaller kids,<br/>\n(Tara gets more money) and hide clues in the eggs to send them on a<br/>\nscavenger hunt in the house when they are done looking for their bigger<br/>\ngifts. Our Easter mornings are always so much fun and well the video&#39;s speak<br/>\nfor themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"jmcseals SEALS","from":"&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Easter Egg hunts/competition","postDate":"1051906778","msgId":67426,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjIxdkE1U21GV2RwUDgwMDAxNTc4ZUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":67421,"nextInTopic":67456,"prevInTime":67425,"nextInTime":67427,"topicId":67405,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh!

In our family, we do the hunts over and over.  <br/>\nThe kids especially love hiding the eggs for mom and dad to find, which is <br/>\nreally fun!  They love watching us *pretend* fight over the eggs and <br/>\ngoodies!  Here we are, two grown ups, pushing and shoving each other around <br/>\n(in an obviously playful way) and stealing each others eggs.  The kids just <br/>\nroll around the yard laughing hysterically and take pictures of us to show <br/>\neveryone.  It&#39;s really a blast!<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we are finished hunting, we dump everything into the Easter Bunny&#39;s <br/>\nbasket...a huge basket the easter bunny leaves for us to share our goodies <br/>\nfrom.  This way, no one gets upset because they ran out of candy or treats <br/>\nbefore anyone else.  (They keep personal goodies like their new toothbrushes <br/>\nand small gifts in their own baskets.)  If they all grab treats from the <br/>\nsame basket, no one keeps count of who had how much, etc.  It really works <br/>\nout great for us and the kids see that competition is just a fun and playful <br/>\nthing!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67528,"nextTopicId":67531}}
