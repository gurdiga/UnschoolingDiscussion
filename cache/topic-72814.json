This is what we decided--<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got the PS2,  also for various reasons:  lots of games, dvd player,  great graphics.     It has been used and enjoyed greatly.   I think the only thing that we miss in having it is the Nintendo games,  Mario and I want to play Zelda.   Have to have a Gamecube for that,  I think that&#39;s the one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last few weeks we&#39;ve been able to play with the Gamecube,  my son traded a pokemon game for the use of one for a month.  The graphics look pretty similar to PS2,  but again I think the difference was that there aren&#39;t as many games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI havn&#39;t gotten the Zelda game yet,  I might go rent it and try it, while we have this Gamecube.   Then I&#39;ll decide if we are going to get a Gamecube too.   Or if its worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing to mention too,  (which is what I&#39;ve been doing when looking at another game system) check out pawnshops with this stuff,   my son just got a new Final Fantasy 10 game, for $25.00.   In the store it would have been $50.00.    It was missing its instructions and it had a tiny scratch on it.   To remedy the missing instructions he&#39;s been researching the game on the internet,  the scratch hasn&#39;t been a problem(we have 10 days to return it if it is a problem).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll also ask my son more about this when he gets up!<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
