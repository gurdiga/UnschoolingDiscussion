She&#39;s worked since a month after<br/>\nthat.  Most of her work has been food and/or service<br/>\nrelated.  She would like eventually to own a small<br/>\nrestaurant.  She learns a great deal from each job,<br/>\nand enjoys having more than enough money to live on. <br/>\nI chose to spend all my time with her as she grew up,<br/>\nonly taking jobs I could do at home or with her along.<br/>\n I&#39;ve always been satisfied that I did the best thing<br/>\nfor us both, but we did without a lot of material<br/>\nthings.  Now she enjoys greater  physical comfort and<br/>\neven gives her little sister an allowance.  Her<br/>\npresent job with a food factory involves her with the<br/>\nEPA, so she&#39;s learning a lot about legal issues,<br/>\nhealth, and safety.  What she liked best in college<br/>\nwere the theatre classes.  If she had transferred to<br/>\nthe university she would have majored in theatre.  She<br/>\nloves the art of stage and screen production.  She<br/>\nwrites beautifully and designs clothing and decor. <br/>\nLife is long and takes us where we should go.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nalways emphasized that the most important thing we can<br/>\ndo is help others.  My girls are good and kind people.<br/>\n As long as they are comfortable with the people<br/>\naround them, I&#39;m happy for them.  I know the places<br/>\nI&#39;ve landed have always been better than where I<br/>\nthought I wanted to go, so I also emphasize the<br/>\nimportance of allowing life to unfold and waiting for<br/>\na sense of guidance.  If Carrie becomes an actor or a<br/>\nrestauranteur, she&#39;ll touch people&#39;s lives in an<br/>\nimportant way, but I want them to understand that we<br/>\nall give of ourselves within whatever sphere we<br/>\ninhabit, and it&#39;s always important.  <br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nDiana<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGreat stuff seeking new owners in Yahoo!
