I think you are wise to do as much as possible to<br/>\navoid making the problem any worse.  BUT you do need to do<br/>\nsomething if it has gotten to the point you are this<br/>\nuncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I have a &quot;big&quot; conversation coming up, I practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I identify my goal - is it to convert them to your<br/>\nbeliefs, to demonstrate that you are superior, to get them to<br/>\nquit talking about it altogether, to get them to quit talking<br/>\nabout it in a way that relates to you and your family?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I look at why they are doing the thing that is<br/>\nbothersome.  Here it can help to have a friend or spouse take<br/>\nyour position while you argue theirs - you may try out &quot;I want to<br/>\ntalk about God to you because I am a deluded, low-brow Baptist,&quot;<br/>\nor &quot;I want to talk about God to you because so much of my life is<br/>\ntied into the Church, I really don&#39;t have any other small talk&quot;<br/>\nor &quot;I have the most precious gift of all time, it delights me so<br/>\nmuch I want to share it with you as part of a friendship.&quot;  Which<br/>\nof these or a myriad other possibilities rings truest to you as<br/>\nyou argue their point will tell you more about why they are<br/>\npushing religion than any &quot;just thinking&quot; about the why will.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, I look for convergence between my goal and their<br/>\nmotivation - trying hard to remember that I may have inadequate<br/>\ninformation or perception to be accurate about their goal and may<br/>\nneed to shift ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen practice making your pitch to a friend/spouse/maybe even a<br/>\nkid, asking them to react as your neighbor would - then critique<br/>\nhow each step made each other feel.  I&#39;ve even done this on video<br/>\ntape for clients who really had a very big pitch to make, but<br/>\njust practice and de brief works wonders.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally (almost) decide where and how to set your stage. If they<br/>\nare perhaps simply following their peer group experience of<br/>\nmaking friends by evangelizing, you might want to invite them<br/>\nover for a small social/friendly thing as part of the setting -<br/>\nsay a watermelon cutting or something similarly low key.  If they<br/>\n<br/>\nThen (and this is the final step) make your pitch shortly after<br/>\nthey enquire about the state of your soul.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Cheryl Duke&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cheryl@...\">cheryl@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, June 29, 2002 12:11 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] A good experience and an<br/>\ninterestingproblem<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| ***Is it possible to have a &quot;we like you and value our<br/>\nfriendship, but can<br/>\n| we please declare a truce on religion&quot; sort of conversation?<br/>\nTo agree that<br/>\n| you are different from each other, and leave it at that?
