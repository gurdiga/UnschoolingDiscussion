Clooney&#39;s character says to him, &quot;You just do it, the courage comes afterwards.&quot;  It was a real &quot;aha&quot; moment for me.  I recognized the truth of the statement and it really stayed with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Bahai, they teach that sometimes you have to try something - commit wholeheartedly to your decision and implement it - then you will find out if it was the &quot;right&quot; thing or not.  Sometimes we just can&#39;t figure it out solely by intellectualizing about it; we have to actually go forward and &quot;do&quot;.  (of course this works better with a decision like &quot;Unschooling&quot; than with, say... jumping off a tall building!!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35645,"nextTopicId":36022}}
