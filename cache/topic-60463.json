We are new to your group and look forward to learning <br/>\nall that we can from you about unschooling. We chose this method but <br/>\nstill have alot to learn about it. We took our 13 year old son out of <br/>\nthe public school last year as he suffered not only mentally but <br/>\nsuffered a head injury as a result of the children and the school <br/>\nitself. We paln on keeping him home for good. Our concern however is <br/>\nsince our son was always an honor roll student and always kept on<br/>\ntask <br/>\nwill this method help him to continue to grow as the bright young man <br/>\nhe is? Since last year we have done everything together daily as a <br/>\nfamily: trips, reading, etc. but we don&#39;t do sit down work (which is <br/>\nsomething he does not enjoy and gets very bored). Is it fine to let <br/>\nhim explore his interest in animals and animals only? He wants to be<br/>\na vet when he&#39;s old enough and he studies this every minute! He likes <br/>\nvideo games (non-violent) and loves to read just about everything! He <br/>\nis not involved in sports or kid functions as we are still having a <br/>\nhard time getting him to be around other children(he&#39;s very scared of <br/>\nthem). We do have him on-line talking to some other children that do <br/>\nnot go to school and that seems to be helping..slowly. We need to<br/>\nhear <br/>\nfrom unschoolers such as you, how a day of unschooling is, is there a <br/>\nconcern they won&#39;t learn, will they ever feel better about public <br/>\nschool kids and the such. Meantime we&#39;ll sit back and read the <br/>\npostings and learn all that we can. <br/>\nThank-you! <br/>\nProtecting Our Son Here In Connecticut<br/>\nKim & Kevin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60492,"nextTopicId":60461}}
