My kids have never<br/>\nthrown a tantrum in their live&#39;s. We&#39;ve always &quot;used our words so mommy<br/>\nknows what you want&quot; or &quot;show mommy - mommy doesn&#39;t understand&quot;. Maybe I<br/>\nused the wrong term  _reward_ and I did NOT use the term punishment - I<br/>\nsaid logical consequences. <br/>\n <br/>\nTracy - who agrees with your handling of this scenario - 100% and I<br/>\nwould have done the same - gotten to the bottom of the problem instead<br/>\nof punishing her for throwing a fit.<br/>\n <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Backstrom kelli [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kellibac@...\">kellibac@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Monday, May 12, 2003 8:44 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] RE: bad mommie moment<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra wrote: &lt;Tracy, that&#39;s not the best way to build real trust and<br/>\njudgment in a kid.<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing you&#39;re new to the list, and that&#39;s cool, but I think it<br/>\nstill <br/>\nmaintains quite an us-and-them dichotomy between parents and kids and <br/>\nunschooling works better without so much of that.&gt;    I guess what I<br/>\nwould like to add to that is that, not only is the above point a good<br/>\none but also what I have noticed in my own parenting and in counselling<br/>\nother parents, is that this approach often does not work, period.
