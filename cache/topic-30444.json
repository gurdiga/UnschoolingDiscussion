WAIT... now, before you respond... let me try to complete this thought..<br/>\nNow, it&#39;s true that it might not work for every person BUT shouldn&#39;t the newbie be given the benefit of the doubt and told about all the various ways of deschooling and so on beFORE she&#39;s confronted with this doubtful post from Bridget? Being a newbie, she would not necessarily *know* that Bridget&#39;s son is different and she would *assume* that this &quot;not working&#39; thing happens more often than it *really* does. <br/>\nSO, wouldn&#39;t it be better if those who are positive supporters of unschooling reach the newbie first and give them the drill THEN, after six months or a year and they post again and say it&#39;s just not happening like it&#39;s been described, Bridget could then make suggestions  based on *her* experience? <br/>\nBefore you decide that unschooling isn&#39;t going to work, there is a process.. a *lengthy* process that has to occur before you throw the ideas out the window. <br/>\nMakes sense???<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n==========================================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a newbie, I have to agree with Sarah.
