Not <br/>\nto say that we didn&#39;t have our share of skeptics who had seen other <br/>\nmethods tried and failed, but we have persevered through the <br/>\nlearning phase and the tension is slowly but surely dispersing as we <br/>\nlearn how to speak &quot;street giraffe.&quot; Awesome to see the whole <br/>\nprocess work its magic with a little effort...=:=<br/>\n<br/>\nThe online resources at CNVC.org are the best place to get a quick <br/>\nstart -- very comprehensive.  After getting a basic idea about how <br/>\nthe process works, I would suggest reading the advanced class notes <br/>\n(even as a novice) for some advice on introducing this to others <br/>\nwithout turning them off by the mechanics of the method.  That&#39;s <br/>\nwhat I meant by &quot;street&quot; or idiomatic giraffe (you&#39;ll find out where <br/>\nanimals fit into the picture soon enough :o)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter exhausting the online resources and joining a couple of <br/>\ndiscussion groups here on Yahoo! -- Synergy Communication and NVC-<br/>\nparenting -- I ordered the &quot;Basics of NVC&quot; video set (suggested for <br/>\nthose without local support groups) and a couple of puppets (one <br/>\ngiraffe, one jackal) for the kids.  The puppets are very well made <br/>\n(and reasonably priced) and the kids enjoyed interacting with them <br/>\nright out of the box.  After a day or so of free play (I&#39;m sounding <br/>\nvery &quot;education&quot; even though it was just plain ole fun,) we sat down <br/>\nand watched the videos together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was only one semi-reluctant camper guilted into giving it a <br/>\nchance in the beginning (old habits die hard) and a few moans as <br/>\nMarshall Rosenberg (founder of CNVC and workshop leader) opened up <br/>\nthe session in song.  I&#39;m afraid it reminded them a bit too much of <br/>\ndear old mom playing folk music on my guitar :oP) but Marshall soon <br/>\nwon the whole clan over with his candor and flair for interacting <br/>\nwith a group -- not to mention his puppeteering skills (a bit <br/>\ncheesy, but amusingly so.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re ordering ears next -- visual aids &#39;R&#39; us :o) In the meantime, <br/>\none of the kids crocheted me a pair of giraffe ears for my birthday <br/>\nnot long ago -- they&#39;re so cute and a hoot to boot!  Group hug time <br/>\nand warm, fuzzy feelings all around... best present I&#39;ve gotten in a <br/>\nlong time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a new edition to a book called the &quot;Compassionate <br/>\nClassroom.&quot;  They tell me that it&#39;s an art-based textbook written by <br/>\na couple of NVC trainers, one of which is an advisor to the <br/>\nGlobalVillageSchool.org  We&#39;re not much for lesson plans and I&#39;m not <br/>\nexactly sure how this book is set up, but hopefully it was <br/>\ninfluenced by Marshall, who worked with John Holt in the early years <br/>\nand is an advocate of homeschooling.  I figure it will have some <br/>\ngood ideas to play around with, anyway, and the NVC-parenting group <br/>\nis discussing possibilities of using it for a virtual chat/workshop <br/>\nin the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nVayan con Dios, Amigos ~<br/>\nPenne Sue (my sister Pamela&#39;s middle name, too :o) & the Crew<br/>\n<br/>\nTHERE is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. <br/>\nSHAKESPEARE<br/>\n<br/>\nQuotation from the frontispiece to Science & Health with Key to the <br/>\nScriptures by Mary Baker Eddy<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.christianscience.org/SAH.html\">http://www.christianscience.org/SAH.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n*Center for Nonviolent Communication<br/>\nhttp;//www.cnvc.org<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, pam sorooshian <br/>\n&lt;pamsoroosh@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Could you suggest a starting point for those interested in NVC? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(Sorry <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; if I missed it.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Dec 31, 2004, at 11:21 PM, Penne & Buddies wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see NVC as a practical and workable solution to the problem of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; communication in the home (in any scenario, but especially if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone&#39;s bark is basically bigger than his bite.) <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: a difficult problem -- New Year&#39;s Conflict Resolution","postDate":"1104627925","msgId":102058,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYyREE1MTEwLTVDNUEtMTFEOS1BMEZCLTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNyNWoxcCthMzdvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNyNWoxcCthMzdvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":102054,"nextInTopic":102194,"prevInTime":102057,"nextInTime":102059,"topicId":101856,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Could you suggest a starting point for those interested in NVC?

I have been told that so many times and tried it and it never worked. I agree with Sandra and Penne I defenatly see your point now. Not to say that I am withdrawing what I said earlier though, I just could have been a bit nicer about it. I did feel attacked and was venting my frustrations in this matter, for that I appologize. To bad I cant just call you all up and explain it better. I am not wanting anyone to see him with horns, although I know that was the impression I was giving.I can see where I was over reacting to the messages sent. Domestic situations are always hard to deal with and maybe it is something that should be left alone in the future although I have to say I have got a whole heck of a lot of wonderful advice and some advice I wanted to scream at. Overall the experiance has been a great learning tool and I am thankful for the opportunity to<br/>\n find resources. If I offended any of you I appologize, that wasnt what I was trying to do. I am far to close to this situation to be commenting on it. Its painful and at times I feel trapped, overwhelmed and scared. I was hurt that so many people were making assumptions about my personality when you have never met me before. I should not have taken it as a personal attack but rather one that is fictional as Karen said earlier. I sent the message before I read hers, oops....:-) We are all looking for support here and I have found it. Would it be possible to maybe take me out of the topic if you all want to continue talking about it? This is all I am going to say on the matter now. Im gonna move on to some of the other discussions and see if I cant get some ideas from those.

I get the impression that it came as a complete surprise to <br/>\nher when we didn&#39;t all immediately see her spouse as an unforgivable <br/>\nogre who should be punished for his transgressions against innocent <br/>\nchildren, if not their mother.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no quick & easy fix to this or any problem, but there are <br/>\nways to make it better sooner than later.  I devoured all of the <br/>\nliterature on NVC when I first discovered it a month or so ago, and <br/>\ngot my kids involved in making a significant change in the way we <br/>\ninteract.  Not to say that we didn&#39;t have our share of skeptics who <br/>\nhad seen other methods tried and failed, but we have persevered <br/>\nthrough the learning phase and the tension is slowly but surely <br/>\ndispersing as we learn how to speak &quot;street giraffe.&quot;  Awesome to <br/>\nsee the whole process work its magic with a little effort... <br/>\n<br/>\nSteffie, my parents have been struggling in a difficult relationship <br/>\nfor sixty plus years.  There is no doubt that there is a deep and <br/>\nabiding love between them, despite their differences.  My siblings <br/>\nand I picked up on the best and the worst features of that marriage, <br/>\nand applied it to our own relationships.  One of my brothers tied <br/>\nand loosed the knot (voluntarily and otherwise) three times before <br/>\nhe finally decided life itself wasn&#39;t worth the effort.  The other <br/>\nhas been through as many engagements for the past thirty years of <br/>\nadulthood while never once making it all the way to the altar.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister and I have held on to our husbands and families for dear <br/>\nlife (both older brides in our mid-twenties -- hers lasting for <br/>\nthirty-five years now, mine for twenty) for better and for worse, <br/>\njust like dear old mom (married the year after graduation to her <br/>\nhighschool sweetheart before he headed off to war.) We see it as a <br/>\nconscientious and informed decision made for our own sakes as well <br/>\nas for our spouses and children.  We are committed to making it work <br/>\nand have faith that this is entirely possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave we made a grave mistake based on our delusions which will be <br/>\npassed on to the next generation or will we eventually find a way to <br/>\nbreak the cycle like Erica?  Again I say, who is qualified to make <br/>\nthat determination?  Like I told my stepson when he was going back & <br/>\nforth between homes, playing one parent against the other, never <br/>\nfacing the situation head-on -- not for lack of desire, but for lack <br/>\nof the necessary tools to resolve conflict -- if you cannot make <br/>\nthings work for you in your present situation, what are the odds of <br/>\nsuccess in any other?  He is discovering this basic truth for <br/>\nhimself now that he searched for love outside of the family circle <br/>\nand ended up with another broken home (this time with a child of his <br/>\nown to deal with the consequences of a failed relationship.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my faith this outcome is Scientifically-based -- IOW, the way <br/>\nLife works.  One can ignore or run away from a given problem, but <br/>\nthere&#39;s absolutely no way to get around it and move on to the next <br/>\nlevel without the knowledge and skills to build a solid foundation.  <br/>\nThe basic problem must first be resolved satisfactorily, either here <br/>\nor hereafter.  Losing a person and relationship (tough to do with <br/>\nkids involved) may seem like the only out, but it is guaranteed to <br/>\ncompound the situation if the basic needs have not been addressed.  <br/>\nCompassionate communication is a -step- in the right direction for <br/>\nme.  <br/>\n<br/>\nVayan con Dios, Amigos ~<br/>\nPenne & the Crew<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://connections.ardfamilyco-op.net/pdacard1.jpg\">http://connections.ardfamilyco-op.net/pdacard1.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNonviolent Conflict Resolution<br/>\nhttp;//www.cnvc.org</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: a difficult problem (Resolved, thank you all!...","postDate":"1104599124","msgId":102022,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwLjNiNWY0ZmZjLjJmMDgzMjU0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":102019,"nextInTopic":102033,"prevInTime":102021,"nextInTime":102023,"topicId":101856,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/1/05 9:34:36 AM, steffieb28@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1158091626\">In a message dated 1/1/05 9:34:36 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steffieb28@...\">steffieb28@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; The irronic thing about that is there was no compassion being shown to me <br/>\nby some of you, telling me to save my marriage at all costs.

Assuming I had my mind made up when I first sent you the note.  I didnt, and still in my message earlier said that if I leave had yet to be decided. You and some of the others have blasted how I should be compassionate to him assuming I never was.The irronic thing about that is there was no compassion being shown to me by some of you, telling me to save my marriage at all costs.  Telling me I should seek counsling when I was asking about the unschooling issue and how to handle that. It is obvious to me that you have had no incounters with abuse, and you are far from qualified to even suggest to someone what they should do. The only reason why I sent a message to you in the first place was because you obviously hold a big reputation for being good in the unschooling circle. I was hoping to find answers to my problem on the issue with my kids. I didnt realize you all would take it upon yourself to tell me what I should do in my marriage. There were<br/>\n several people who informed me that what my husband was doing was far from ok, so that when I started really looking into my marriage. I have lived with this for 30 years, and for you to be ugly and make assumptions to an entire group about me and what I feel was wrong. You had no right. I tried to end the topic by telling you all it was resolved and you continued to talk about me like I had little or no thought on what I was doing. Totally disrepectitng my wish to end a topic about my situation. Not to mention the women who my be lurking about, in the same abusive situaion and now are afraid to talk because some of you are hell bent on getting the abusier help and not the people being beat down.  I was trying to say you have no idea what I am really going through and if you dont mind lets let this one go. I had pulled something useful from each comment before and was on the road to getting help. But yet you the moderator continued. I didnt waste the groups time, you did.

All of the senerios that you all are saying I <br/>\nshould &#39;try&quot; go along with what he wants, not what the other 4 <br/>\npeople in the house want. ...<br/>\n<br/>\n[PA] Steffie, I was under the impression that you and the kids were <br/>\nseeking peace in your household and offered a way to begin the <br/>\nprocess through conflict resolution.  It wasn&#39;t about helping your <br/>\nhusband, _per se_, it was about helping yourselves and bringing him <br/>\nalong for the ride while you focus on learning better ways to <br/>\ninteract. It&#39;s clear that your children, if not you & your spouse, <br/>\ncould use some survival tools in the area of communication.  Am I <br/>\ncorrect?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI heard that your husband was willing to go to counseling at one <br/>\ntime, so I can only guess that he&#39;s not adverse to the idea of <br/>\nreconciliation through some means, but is probably feeling just as <br/>\ndesperate, trapped, and hopeless by the seeming lack of viable <br/>\noptions at you seem to be. I&#39;d like to know if this is an accurate <br/>\ndepiction of your needs and if you see him also wishing for peace, <br/>\nunderstanding, and respect in a different way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA closer look at Nonviolent Communication (NVC - www.cnvc.org) would <br/>\nreveal that it is a self-help process (vs. counseling) that requires <br/>\nno cooperation from others to create lasting and effective change <br/>\nfor everyone&#39;s peace of mind.  IOW, DH doesn&#39;t have to agree to it <br/>\nor learn it for himself in order for you & the kids to have an <br/>\nimpact on the relationship which will serve your needs for harmony <br/>\nand understanding (I&#39;m hearing the Fifth Dimension in the background <br/>\nnow :o)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarshall Rosenberg teaches warring factions both at home and abroad <br/>\nhow to hear criticism as a plea for help rather than a call to arms, <br/>\nand it works.  IMHO, we&#39;ll all need to learn this one sooner or <br/>\nlater, if we are to create and maintain healthy relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear your distress and frustration at the confusion experienced by <br/>\nsome of us on this list which may come across as harsh and <br/>\njudgmental.  I, for one, neither desired nor requested to hear the <br/>\ngraphic details of your life and marriage as one who usually feels <br/>\nuncomfortable about revealing intimate details to an audience of <br/>\nvirtual strangers.  Yet, many of us needed to understand enough to <br/>\njustify the advice to go (which seemed radical based on your <br/>\noriginal posts) or to stay (which seemed like a reasonable option.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI heard fear of a custody battle, not fear for your life, in your <br/>\ninitial plea for help in resolving this conflict.  I honestly <br/>\nthought it was a communication issue, as implied by the context of <br/>\nthe situation, and responded accordingly.  Now I&#39;m guessing that <br/>\nyour husband was not formally charged in the altercation you <br/>\nmentioned, and he has refrained from displaying his temper in this <br/>\nmanner in front of the children thus far?  No pressure to answer, I <br/>\njust wanted you to know what I&#39;m hearing in your response.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd after all is said and done, it still appears to me that the <br/>\nyears of conflict have basically worn you both down to a frazzle, <br/>\nand I&#39;m amazed either one of you has stuck it out this long -- yet <br/>\nisn&#39;t that just as much an indicator that there is mutual concern <br/>\nfor the welfare of the family as it is that someone has been in <br/>\ndenial and under coersion/abusive circumstances for the entire <br/>\nrelationship?  What &quot;expert&quot; (lay or professional) is qualified to <br/>\ndetermine the mental health of any one individual?  It was a shocker <br/>\nfor us to learn that the government has now decided to mandate <br/>\nmental health screening for all children in the System -- what a <br/>\nPandora&#39;s box this will open!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m glad to hear that you are finding some power over your <br/>\nsituation, and that perhaps the decision to leave everything behind <br/>\nis not final just yet.  Before I bow out of this discussion, I <br/>\nwanted to make sure that you understood my suggestion fully because <br/>\nyour message implied that there was some confusion on this score.  I <br/>\nsee NVC as a practical and workable solution to the problem of <br/>\ncommunication in the home (in any scenario, but especially if <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s bark is basically bigger than his bite.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I understand it, this naturally leads to better relations in the <br/>\nfamily and ultimately to permanent conflict resolution, often easier <br/>\nand faster than anyone ever thought possible.  Life is more perfect <br/>\nthan we realize, if we have eyes to see and a little love in our <br/>\nhearts (and the world will be a better place, and the world will be <br/>\na better place... incurable romantics and flower children sing <br/>\nalong.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you&#39;re probably not in the mood for a songfest, would you be <br/>\nwilling to reflect back to me what I said about meeting your own & <br/>\nyour family&#39;s needs (kids and/or husband) through conflict <br/>\nresolution so I can be sure the message came across as intended?  It <br/>\nwould give me greater peace of mind knowing that I made myself clear <br/>\non the point that I was advocating empowerment through self-reliant <br/>\nmethods of improving communication skills.

You all say give him another chance assuming I havent given him any yet. You make assumptions that i havent tried every avenue. Why would anyone think that I would have the power to change another human. Counsling is only good when both people are willing to accept and take responsiblility for their actions. Its crazy to bother trying when one of the parteners is placing blame souly on the other. Not to mention I dont want to go to counsling. I&#39;ve been, and it didnt work. I come away feeling guilty for wanting peace in my life, as if that is something I dont have the right to have. I shouldnt have to go into the details of my marriage. Its none of your business to be quite frank. The problem at hand was the verbal abuse that my kids endure from their dad because they are unschooled/homeschooled. Is that ok? I know you all are saying No, but some of you havent told me yet how to change that. Amazing huh, cant tell<br/>\n me can you, sure lots of resources I could use to help him right, but what if he doesnt want to be helped. Then what? I just stay and let myself and my kids be verbaly abused everyday of our lives, always walking on eggshells because we never know if he will be mad that day or not. Or better yet I take their rights away and put them back in school. All of the senerios that you all are saying I should &#39;try&quot; go along with what he wants, not what the other 4 people in the house want. Oh and he is not the only one who works. I work a 40 hour a week job for the same company as him, I just get to stay at home. I have had my right for peace taken from me and my kids for way to long. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust so you all know there has been physical abuse, he has grabbed me on several occassions and left bruises. Not to mention blackened my eye, drunk or not, he still did it. He walked away with nothing but a sick stomach. That is documented, the cops came and seperated us. Luckily the kids were not there to see it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not ruining his name he is doing that all on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI for one am starting to get really upset with the help the husband comments. Thats what got me here to begin with, I was always trying to help him. Make him happy, give him peace, give him love, ect....now look at me. Still here in the same place sick to death of listening to his degrating sarcasim. I am not saying every woman should leave at the first sign of unhappiness, but if you have lived with unhappiness for more than a year I would say it was time to find a different avenue. Leaving isnt the answer, finding my power and taking it back is. What I do with it is still yet to be decided. I can say though if I leave it will be because there was no resolution to this problem, not because I am some selfish woman who got pissed off at her husband because he wouldnt watch the kids so she could get her nails done. I have been far from selfish. This isnt just about me anyway, its about the well-being of my kids and their futures. They have a right to have peace in their lives just as<br/>\n you do. that is all I am really asking for. The right to wake up and not be yelled at or flipped off, just for being alive......<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as i am concerned this is about unschooling because its about my kids rights being imposed upon. They are not allowed to learn in a peaceful enviroment free from critisims and sarcasim.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!

The best way to keep <br/>\nthe funds rolling in is to divide and conquer -- separate the <br/>\nparents first by making sure one admits to being a victim (whether <br/>\nor not this is the actual case is not the main concern,) then <br/>\nrequire legal and physical separation upon threat of removal of the <br/>\nchildren.  There is no plan to reconcile the family or offer any <br/>\ntangible assistance, which leaves the mother vulnerable to further <br/>\ninterference with the threat of losing her children hanging over her <br/>\nhead all the while.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the tragic scenario we&#39;ve heard from family after family who <br/>\nstarted out crying abuse based on false or imagined allegations and <br/>\nended up in real despair outside the home.  My grandniece&#39;s family <br/>\nwas nearly one of those statistics, but they persevered through the <br/>\nCPS nightmare and lived to tell the tale.  I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nalarm &quot;Irene&quot; -- just want to be sure that she is fully informed <br/>\nabout the hazards of claiming serious charges against the father of <br/>\nher children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are women helping women,  and they <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; do it *because* there is abuse in the home.  If there is no <br/>\n </span></blockquote>abuse,  you <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; probably don&#39;t need their services!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[PA] Unless one has been wrongly convinced that one is a victim, <br/>\nwhich is what they did to my grandniece as a preschooler. I was <br/>\nwaiting for them to &quot;recover&quot; some memories from her mother as well, <br/>\nin order to heap more molestation charges on the accused (her <br/>\nstepdad.) Thankfully, the pseudo-psychiatrists in the guise of CPS <br/>\ndid not take it that far nor have the child removed from her home <br/>\n(she was living with her parents at the time.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, they drug her stepfather (who had a spotless record before <br/>\nthis incident) away, and set an exhorbitant bail.  He languished in <br/>\njail for months before the judge decided there was insufficient <br/>\nevidence to prosecute.  The man&#39;s marriage and career, not to <br/>\nmention his reputation, was nearly destroyed by this ordeal.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, this is just one example.  As others have said, there was never <br/>\nany indication of physical abuse in &quot;Irene&#39;s&quot; messages when we were <br/>\nall discussing the pros and cons of her & the children leaving <br/>\nhome.  I missed Erica&#39;s message completely until I came across this <br/>\none, and realized that we were posting at approximately the same <br/>\ntime.  I hadn&#39;t looked back thinking that I was caught up with the <br/>\nthread by then.  I hear a lot of fear and judgment based on past <br/>\nexperience in her sister&#39;s posts, but to say &quot;Irene&quot; is in denial <br/>\nmay be as untrue as saying that her husband&#39;s behavior is abusive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>[PA] &gt; &gt;&gt;I prefer to deal with my personal business in the privacy <br/>\nof my own  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hoe, as long as there is no physical threat to life or limb.   &lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Karen] There&#39;s more to abuse than violence.  <br/>\n<br/>\n[PA]  Yet, the term &quot;abuse&quot; itself is abused and used for something <br/>\nas commonplace as a lovers&#39; quarrel.  I&#39;m sensitive to this as my <br/>\nDIL was self-diagnosing her problems as abuse and co-dependency, <br/>\netc., etc., and I asked her to define exactly what those terms mean <br/>\nto her.  IOW, are she and her baby daughter really in a better place <br/>\nnow that she and my son have alienated themselves from each other <br/>\nover what they admit to be petty misunderstandings, immature <br/>\noutbursts, and frustrated communique?<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I have a new perspective on the idea of &quot;violence&quot; since <br/>\nlearning about Nonviolent (Compassionate) Communication, but in the <br/>\nabsence of a serious physical threat to life or limb -- I would <br/>\npersonally think twice before abandoning my partner and my marriage <br/>\nwith no warning whatsoever (again, unless I had reason to fear an <br/>\nemotional breakdown, outrage, and physical abuse to follow.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf &quot;Irene&quot; has already suffered a black eye, then it&#39;s a question of <br/>\nwhether it was an isolated incident perhaps due to one too many <br/>\nunder the strain of circumstances.  I&#39;m not justifying it, just <br/>\ntrying to understand if this is a casual beer drinkin&#39; guy or if <br/>\nhe&#39;s on the verge of not being able to function due to his substance <br/>\nabuse problem.  Assuming he&#39;s bringing home the bacon and &quot;Irene&#39;s&quot; <br/>\na SAHM, I&#39;m not sure where this diagnosis is coming from or if it&#39;s <br/>\na judgment call or simply fear of where things may be headed based <br/>\non past experience.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s a shame to rip this man&#39;s life apart without warning or <br/>\ncounseling on one end or the other -- I know my husband isn&#39;t always <br/>\nMr. Nice Guy, and I might label some of his remarks obnoxious, but <br/>\nnot abusive, but it would devastate him if I made that kind of <br/>\ndecision.  Of course, if he ever hit me (even once) he would be <br/>\nextremely sorry for it because I would never let him live it down.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first years of our marriage, I got a little too up close and <br/>\npersonal with my DH regarding something that was causing me <br/>\ndistress, and he pushed me backward a foot or so (never let go) till <br/>\nI got the message to back off. I was livid that he laid his hands on <br/>\nme(!) and reduced to tears, so yes, I completely understand that <br/>\nthere&#39;s more to it than meets the eye (no pun intended) -- I would <br/>\nstill be very careful to apply the label &quot;abuse&quot; with the wide <br/>\nvariety of definitions (from benign to criminal) being tossed around <br/>\never-so-liberally these days.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>[PA] &gt;&gt; It&#39;s been a great comfort to discover that I do not <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; have  to physically remove myself or anyone else from the premises <br/>\n </span></blockquote>in <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; order to  resolve a conflict or challenge of any kind.  &lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Karen] If all our  lives were oh so perfect!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Karen<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, we can dream, can&#39;t we?!  Yes, I was talking about the ideal <br/>\nand yes, it&#39;s easier said than done, but our lives don&#39;t have to be <br/>\nperfect to make a change for the better and put this into practice.  <br/>\nOn the contrary, it&#39;s even more important to understand that there <br/>\nare options within and that nothing and no one without can determine <br/>\nthe state of our being -- especially in what appears to be <br/>\nchallenging circumstances.  This is essential to our Spiritual, <br/>\nPhysical, and Mental welfare (and that&#39;s no SPaM!) <br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line, it&#39;s wise to be wary of any helpful &quot;services&quot; which <br/>\nadvocate extreme actions, unless the circumstances truly warrant a <br/>\ncomplete detachment from another (and I think this must be much <br/>\nrarer than is commonly believed.)  If the husband/parent is truly <br/>\nabusive, he should be criminally prosecuted to the fullest extent of <br/>\nthe law and placed in rehab, FWIW.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnless the black eye was documented as domestic abuse and charges <br/>\nfiled, I&#39;m afraid that &quot;Irene&quot; won&#39;t have much of a case against her <br/>\nhusband and leaving him will no doubt provoke him to anger.  Not to <br/>\nsay that she should stick around to gather &quot;evidence,&quot; but only she <br/>\ncan determine if she has taken every step possible to correct the <br/>\nproblem before making a break.  I thought that this thread was all <br/>\nabout helping &quot;Irene&quot; find some new ways to approach this problem, <br/>\nand now she&#39;s back to square one -- love him or leave him.
