I get confronted by people all the<br/>\ntime on the safety of his job and then inform them<br/>\nthat they have a better chance of getting shot walking<br/>\ndown the street than DH does at work. I had concidered<br/>\ntelling this to DS today but I don&#39;t think he would be<br/>\nable to understand or relate to that. When he went to<br/>\nbed tonight, I asked him if he felt better about daddy<br/>\nto night and he said he did. I also reminded him that<br/>\nsometimes bad things happen but that they aren&#39;t<br/>\nalways as bad as they could be. He recently was<br/>\nhospitalised for a snake bite. At the time we let him<br/>\nknow that he could have lost his whole leg and that he<br/>\nwas lucky that it was a baby snake. I reminded him of<br/>\nthis and told him that Heavenly Father is watching out<br/>\nfor daddy and that He knows DS needs his daddy still<br/>\nand that He is protecting him. DS said, &quot;And Jesus<br/>\ntoo?&quot; I asured him that Jesus was protecting daddy as<br/>\nwell. I think he feels better about it. I expect that<br/>\nit will take some time for him to get completely<br/>\ncomfortable (as completely as can be). But he&#39;s better<br/>\ntonight and that is what counts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A few years ago there was an article in either our<br/>\n&gt; local paper or one of<br/>\n&gt; the Toronto papers about the dangers of different<br/>\n&gt; jobs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Police officers jobs were rated as one of the safer<br/>\n&gt; jobs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe this would help comfort your son a little.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Buzz<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   <br/>\n&gt;  The Klement Family       &quot;Education is what<br/>\n&gt; survives when <br/>\n&gt;  Darryl, Debbie,           what has been learned has<br/>\n&gt; been <br/>\n&gt;  Kathleen, Nathan &        forgotten&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  Samantha                  B.F.

After I read everyones posts on<br/>\nthis matter I sat down and to DS that he was right,<br/>\nDaddy could get shot at work. Then explained that<br/>\neverybody does things everyday that could cause them<br/>\nto get hurt. I gave him senarios like driving, playing<br/>\noutside, and just last week DH was chopping down a<br/>\ntree with a brand new ax when the head flew off and<br/>\nlanded in my bil&#39;s knee (DH&#39;s brother). He had to get<br/>\nstitches but he will be okay. I also told him that it<br/>\nwas possible for a terrible storm to come and blow out<br/>\nthe windows of the house and a tree could fall on the<br/>\nhouse as well. Then I said that any of these things<br/>\ncould happen, but they probbably won&#39;t. I also gave he<br/>\nknows about DH&#39;s vest and has even tried it on and<br/>\nworn it around the house. I told him that daddy wears<br/>\nthe vest to protect him in case he gets shot and told<br/>\nhim about an officer in our town just last week who<br/>\ngot shot and went to the hospital and then they sent<br/>\nhim home that night. His vest saved him. (I didn&#39;t<br/>\ntell DS that the officer was also shot in both hands.)<br/>\nI also told him that it was good for us to pray that<br/>\nwe are all kept safe, not just daddy. He said he felt<br/>\na little better after. I think it is something that<br/>\nstill bothers him but I don&#39;t think that it will<br/>\nconstantly be in the back of his mind.

I<br/>\n&gt; have a 5 yo son, and a 3 yo <br/>\n&gt; son, and a 10 mo daughter.  For most of my<br/>\n&gt; children&#39;s lives, my dh has worked <br/>\n&gt; day shift.  Sounds like yours is working 3rd shift<br/>\n&gt; now.    Where do you live? <br/>\n&gt;  We live in So. Indiana.  You have said that you are<br/>\n&gt; very open with him... <br/>\n&gt; how much does he know about police work?  Our boys<br/>\n&gt; really have not asked much <br/>\n&gt; about getting shot.  They have very limited<br/>\n&gt; knowledge about guns.  I think <br/>\n&gt; our oldest has asked if dh has ever shot anyone, <br/>\n&gt; and dh told him that he had <br/>\n&gt; not, and hoped that he never has to.  Dh explained<br/>\n&gt; that the gun was there to <br/>\n&gt; be used only for protection when he was at work.  He<br/>\n&gt; keeps the explanations <br/>\n&gt; &quot;short and sweet&quot; at this time in their lives.  Then<br/>\n&gt; he makes sure that the <br/>\n&gt; kids get exposed to the many aspects of police work,<br/>\n&gt; such as helping people <br/>\n&gt; in different ways.  They enjoy hearing the sirens on<br/>\n&gt; the squad car, visiting <br/>\n&gt; the station, and wearing old uniform shirts.  Has<br/>\n&gt; your son watched much tv <br/>\n&gt; where police dramas might be on?  Or does he have<br/>\n&gt; friends that have said <br/>\n&gt; something to scare him , maybe?  One thing you can<br/>\n&gt; do is let your son see the <br/>\n&gt; protective vest and maybe even put it on, so he can<br/>\n&gt; see how heavy it is.  You <br/>\n&gt; can help him see how it is there to protect his<br/>\n&gt; daddy , just in case there <br/>\n&gt; would ever be a &quot;bad guy&quot; that had a gun.  And then<br/>\n&gt; express that most police <br/>\n&gt; officers don&#39;t get shot and don&#39;t use their guns<br/>\n&gt; very often.  Hopefully he <br/>\n&gt; will begin to feel re-assured.  Maybe some library<br/>\n&gt; books on police officers <br/>\n&gt; could be helpful, as they are light-hearted in<br/>\n&gt; nature, and maybe will be <br/>\n&gt; helpful in lessening his worries.  Most of all,<br/>\n&gt; stress that police officers <br/>\n&gt; are there to help people, and that is their main<br/>\n&gt; purpose.  Give examples such <br/>\n&gt; as helping people if their cars break down, helping<br/>\n&gt; people settle arguments, <br/>\n&gt; help to find someone who is lost, etc...  Just keep<br/>\n&gt; trying to reinforce the <br/>\n&gt; other aspects of this line  of work, and keep<br/>\n&gt; reassuring him that most <br/>\n&gt; officers never have to shoot people, and that most<br/>\n&gt; officers never get shot.  <br/>\n&gt; I hope this helps a little!  Take care.  ~Karen<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
