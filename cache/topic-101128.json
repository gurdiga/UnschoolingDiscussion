I&#39;ve been silenced from this list before because they are mostly  <br/>\nhomeschoolers in the traditional sense. She had forwarded me Helen&#39;s  thoughts and <br/>\nposition on it. I wrote back after being bitter for several days  and told her <br/>\nthat I would NOT like to be lumped together. That said I was  slightly annoyed <br/>\nwhen she posted stating that she was one of the voices for our  state in some <br/>\nNHEN discussion or article. Huh?<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen traditional homeschooling-HSLDA supporters start saying they are  <br/>\nspeaking for me I get a lil annoyed.<br/>\nI do speak up (and duck) when discussions take place but im not very  <br/>\nsupported at all. As a matter a fact our state list has a good 200-300 people  and <br/>\nwhen I post I get attacked for my thoughts by a select few and NO one else  <br/>\nspeaks unless that are attacking me.
