Don&#39;t remember the exact wording now but as in you always have <br/>\nto then whatever it was. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not always and saying so makes the <br/>\nkid kind of feel like he needs to live up to that expectation. Not a good <br/>\nthing. I&#39;ve done it too. Just a wrong choice of words. Made my daugher feel <br/>\nreal bad. Felt awful afterwards myself. I certainly didn&#39;t mean &quot;always&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure most of us lose it from time to time, especially with younger kids <br/>\nand more than a few. It&#39;s okay to have a meltdown and let them know. It&#39;s <br/>\nthe way we go about it that might come about better. I had a hard time <br/>\nreading your post as in getting through it and I&#39;m wondering how the kids <br/>\nfelt listening to it all. Seems like some tension was there long before the <br/>\nactual &quot;Let me tell you what&#39;s going on with me&quot; talk. I&#39;m wondering how <br/>\nmuch of it all they really listened to. When I feel like that, I walk away <br/>\nbefore the tone comes out and before the voice starts to get louder. Then I <br/>\ncome back when I&#39;m easier to be around. Why would my kids want me to be <br/>\naround and listen when I&#39;m like that?  Going off to Walmart isn&#39;t that <br/>\nimportant that it couldn&#39;t wait a few minutes to straighten feelings out. <br/>\nThen everyone leaves on a good not in the car. The car can be such a nice <br/>\nplace for all to be, why make it stressed? Everyone is pretty much a captive <br/>\naudience anyway, make it so they want to be there!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\">http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] how we affect others","postDate":"1043967490","msgId":57263,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNUY2QzBFLjFDRjglYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDM5NjQyNzkuMTkxMi42NTE0Ny5tMTFAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":57265,"prevInTime":57262,"nextInTime":57264,"topicId":57263,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

This is what<br/>\nhappened, that is what happened.  Just the facts, ma&#39;am.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s unfair is telling people &quot;you make me feel (blank)&quot; or &quot;you ALWAYS do<br/>\n(blank)&quot;.  It&#39;s not true, and you know that, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happened today?  You lost it.  So?  Your kids saw a grown up lose it,<br/>\nspeak reasonably about why they&#39;re losing it, and behave like a grown up<br/>\nshould.  You didn&#39;t smack anybody around.  You didn&#39;t tell them they&#39;re<br/>\nrotton horrible brats who never should have been born.  You didn&#39;t scream<br/>\nand rant for hours, break things, get drunk, or any number of other idiotic<br/>\nthings people do when mad.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, they saw a mature woman lose it, live through it, and pull herself<br/>\ntogether again.
