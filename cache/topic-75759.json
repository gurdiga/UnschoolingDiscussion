You all too often don&#39;t give people any room to think they can <br/>\ngrow or learn from their mistakes - as in the example above: I&#39;ve <br/>\nstruggled with letting my kids cry themselves to sleep, and I&#39;ve <br/>\nswatted their butts for not moving when I thought they should. But I <br/>\nlearned, and changed, and others can too. Meet people where they are, <br/>\nand not where you think they should already be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And so I know someone can be unschooling while still requiring kids to meet<br/>\n&gt;schoolish goals, and without trusting the kids with other aspects of their<br/>\n&gt;lives, and not having it change the parents&#39; lives or beliefs.  It&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;not the kind<br/>\n&gt;of unschooling that will work well for years, though.  It is, in my<br/>\n&gt;experience, the kind of unschooling that leads to buying a <br/>\n&gt;curriculum or putting kids<br/>\n&gt;back in school as failures to thrive at unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Once again, a sweeping pronouncement that didn&#39;t turn out to be true <br/>\nin my case, or in many, many others. I&#39;m a second-generation <br/>\nunschooler, so I was *much* better prepared than 99% of the people <br/>\ndoing it today. Unschooling is so totally foreign to what most people <br/>\nhave experienced in their lives that it takes time and a few mistakes <br/>\nto figure out what to do and how to do it. Even with my <br/>\nhaving-been-unschooled background I blew it more often than I like to <br/>\nthink about when I was starting out with my kids. I was sure that <br/>\nexpecting them to buckle down and do bookwork was good for them, was <br/>\nwhat I was *supposed* to be doing. And even today I wonder if one kid <br/>\nwould be a better speller if I&#39;d *made* him put more effort into <br/>\nit... for more about my doubts see my May/June HEM editorial:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/203.html\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/203.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And I won&#39;t say what people want to hear just to give them a moment of<br/>\n&gt;relative happiness.  I&#39;d rather say what I think their children need <br/>\n&gt;their mom to<br/>\n&gt;hear to give them YEARS of greater happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How about saying what they need to hear followed by why you think <br/>\ntheir children need for them to hear something different?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people quit listening to you because you deny their needs, how are <br/>\nyou helping their children?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So I&#39;m staying here.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re staying, because this list wouldn&#39;t be what it <br/>\nis without you.

Her fierce dedication and hard work have <br/>\nmade this list what it is today, and her clear-eyed vision and <br/>\nseemingly endless patience will continue to make it a wonderful place <br/>\nfor anyone interested in unschooling for years to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy changing the name of this list we hoped only to clarify the <br/>\nintent, which is simply to discuss all aspects of unschooling, just <br/>\nas the list has been doing since 1999. The new lists are for those <br/>\nwho want to explore a specific aspect of unschooling (like resources <br/>\nor creativity), or to examine an issue in depth from an unschooling <br/>\nperspective (like politics or how one lives day-to-day). Anyone is <br/>\nwelcome to discuss those same things on this list as well, and we do <br/>\nnot plan to tell people to, as an example, take their excitement over <br/>\na new book over to the Unschooling-Resources list. We might suggest <br/>\nwe share the resource with that list, but nothing related to <br/>\nunschooling will be inappropriate for this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been a frequent contributor to this list in the past, and at <br/>\nsome point I probably will be again. But right now I&#39;m spending the <br/>\nsummer travelling and I won&#39;t be reading or participating nearly as <br/>\nmuch as I&#39;d like to. I&#39;ll be around, though. I&#39;ll read great bunches <br/>\nof posts at a time when I can, and every once in a while I might even <br/>\nventure to post a reply or a comment. For the most part though, I&#39;ll <br/>\nlimit my posting to the new Unschooling-Politics list (political <br/>\naction being my primary interest), and maybe the less-busy <br/>\nUnschooling-Cafe list. On this list or another one, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll see <br/>\nyou around.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you to *everyone* for your patience during this transition.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards,<br/>\nHelen<br/>\n&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;<br/>\nHelen Hegener, Listowner<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM-Editor@...\">HEM-Editor@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":146409249,"authorName":"glad2bmadly","from":"glad2bmadly &lt;glad2bmadly@...&gt;","profile":"glad2bmadly","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] List Changes and Additions","postDate":"1057009439","msgId":75782,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwNjMwMjE0MzU5LjYxODQ0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQyMDA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE5NC4xYjg3ZTUzYi4yYzMxZWI0MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":75781,"nextInTopic":75784,"prevInTime":75781,"nextInTime":75783,"topicId":75759,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m a commited, intense beginner who is glad that you, Sandra, are commited and intense enough to have stuck it out here for so many years.

As a leader, I can tell you that when moms would <br/>\nask how they can coordinate breastfeeding with working <br/>\nfull-time, I&#39;d offer the advice with the caveat: It won&#39;t be the same <br/>\nas nursing at home with your baby and here are the problems <br/>\nyou&#39;ll encounter.

And, I joined because of their description.... for those who are unschooling and homeschooling for non-traditional reasons.  I had no idea what UNschooling was.  NONE!  I thought the people on the list had way out ideas, but they were mostly very loving and they were not judgmental nor jumping down my throat each time I thought something was scary, crazy, or anything else.  They helped me out, they held my hand and showed me, not just told me, how unschooling is better for children.  I was warned about THIS list, the unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups list, because it was not for the timid, not a support group, they say what they think without a sugar coating.  So, when I joined the unschooling-dotcom list I did just hang out in the background and read.  I learned a few things, but skipped the majority of the posts.  One time I posted something about which I wanted seriously honest opinions and it was about my daughter leaving the yard without permission and the situation that followed.  Many people on this list responded.  Most apologized for what they were going to say before they said it.  I was not offended by any of it, but had it been earlier in my research about unschooling, I may have been and those responses may have encouraged me change my mind about unschooling toward curriculum home based education.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  So, I think Homeschool 101 should be for those very compassionate, kind, experienced and patient unschoolers who can help with encouragement and such.  I think people need to be shown and not told, when they are beginners.  And, if people are going to be posting on both lists, they will have to change their mindset, and I hope they will.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Nichole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":45073,"authorName":"amycats2@aol.com","from":"amycats2@...","profile":"amycats2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] List Changes and Additions","postDate":"1056999122","msgId":75769,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwNy4yNGE5OGJlNC4yYzMxZTBkMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":75768,"nextInTopic":75770,"prevInTime":75768,"nextInTime":75770,"topicId":75759,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/30/2003 1:47:29 PM Central Daylight Time, ...

The &quot;days&quot; list kind of appeals to me since I have a collection, but <br/>\nI don&#39;t know how well it will work to have it separate from the discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also like to say for the record that there are a few people here who <br/>\nare more radical about unschooling than I am, but they haven&#39;t been complained <br/>\nabout.  I wrote to a small group of them a month or two ago and said I <br/>\nthought they were going too far (for my comfort), farther than I would and I was <br/>\nused to being the radical fringe!<br/>\n<br/>\nLa Leche League has the same double-level situation unschooling has.   IS it <br/>\njust about nursing babies?  It is and it isn&#39;t.  If people want to nurse <br/>\nbabies on a schedule, it&#39;s not going to work.   If people want to nurse babies and <br/>\nstill see them as sinful, manipulative creatures, it&#39;s not going to work.   So <br/>\nLa Leche League ends up involving itself in &quot;loving discipline&quot; and what <br/>\nfoods to go to as babies are weaning, and family bed, and sibling relations.     <br/>\nNot all of it is breastfeeding.  Some women want to come JUST for breastfeeding <br/>\nhelp.  Thing is, they have no idea of what all will HINDER breastfeeding.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so with this.  Someone can be breastfeeding who is also leaving a baby to <br/>\ncry himself to sleep and swatting kids for not doing what the mom says fast <br/>\nenough.  It won&#39;t change whether they&#39;re breastfeeding.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so I know someone can be unschooling while still requiring kids to meet <br/>\nschoolish goals, and without trusting the kids with other aspects of their <br/>\nlives, and not having it change the parents&#39; lives or beliefs.  It&#39;s not the kind <br/>\nof unschooling that will work well for years, though.  It is, in my <br/>\nexperience, the kind of unschooling that leads to buying a curriculum or putting kids <br/>\nback in school as failures to thrive at unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know too many volunteers at La Leche League who would spend much of <br/>\ntheir volunteer time saying &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter how you treat your child when <br/>\nhe&#39;s not nursing, just so you nurse him.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m a volunteer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I won&#39;t say what people want to hear just to give them a moment of <br/>\nrelative happiness.
