How do you expect to attract those of us with our &quot;heads in the sand&quot; <br/>\nto your consciousness-raising messages with the <br/>\nlook-at-how-I-live-my-life-if-only-everyone-could-do-the-same, <br/>\nself-congratulatory tone that permeates your posts? And do you live your life <br/>\nin this exemplary way in EVERY area? Aren&#39;t you spread kinda thin?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a close friend who works for a peace awareness organization. She is <br/>\npassionately involved in her family&#39;s work here and answers my questions <br/>\nthoughtfully and honestly. She and her husband have spent time in prison for <br/>\nliving their beliefs. But she doesn&#39;t recruit people to live as they do. Or <br/>\nto believe as they do. And she doesn&#39;t &quot;run down&quot; or criticize those who <br/>\nhaven&#39;t had their consciousness raised to the point where they are aware of <br/>\nthe issues that she and her family focus their energies on. Or those who have <br/>\nchosen to focus their energies elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer husband was jailed a few weeks ago at a protest they attended. We had a <br/>\nconversation about our kids at that time, and she didn&#39;t say, &quot;Gee, where <br/>\nwere you? Maybe if you had attended this protest instead of taking the kids <br/>\nto McDonald&#39;s, our voices would have been heard. Why can&#39;t you risk jail time <br/>\nfor what you believe in? If more people lived their convictions...yada yada <br/>\n...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is an inspiration to me in many ways, but her ability to let her life <br/>\nspeak for itself is her strongest witness to me.

When you start splicing genes and you don&#39;t label the product<br/>\nas containing those various genes, you risk (and it isn&#39;t a minor<br/>\npossibility, it is a probability and has already happened) death as your end<br/>\nresult.  Not from cancer but from allergic reactions.  Some allergies such<br/>\nas to the ingredients in aspirin and to nuts, specifically peanuts is not<br/>\njust some shrug it off allergy.  Not knowing what is in your food IS poison<br/>\nto some people.  And playing gene splicing games that make plants more<br/>\nreceptive to pesiticides is making a plant that will hold those pesticides<br/>\nto rates far exceeding what they now do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis whole issue is based on $$$ and not on what is good for anyone but some<br/>\nfat cat&#39;s bank roll!  And, that ain&#39;t crap science, that is a fact!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, on to CA&#39;s energy crisis.  Please stick to the facts instead of what<br/>\nthe nice little news media and the right wing Fox type channels are spewing.<br/>\nYes, most of CA&#39;s power crisis is directly related to politics.  Also, only<br/>\nONE power plants was stopped in CA by the environmentalists.  Personally, I<br/>\nwish they had been able to stop a few more.  I&#39;ve never seen such stupidity<br/>\nin all my life as building nuclear power plants on active earthquake faults!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about if we put some of the blame where it belongs, right directly into<br/>\nthe lap of a Republican govenor who had aspirations of running for president<br/>\nand who got taken by some folks that turned around and put their money in<br/>\nthe Dumbya coffers for his run for president.  Let&#39;s take the $100,000<br/>\nclubers and name some names.  Let&#39;s look at fat cats such as Kenneth Lay,<br/>\nCEO of Enron Corp and Steve Ledbetter, CEO of Reliant Energy.  These two<br/>\nbought up a large number of the power plants when they were put up for sale<br/>\nand have been systematically/deliberatly shutting down the plants to drive<br/>\nup the prices.  Let&#39;s talk Hurowitz (Maxxam) who owned blocks of power, who<br/>\ndecided to teach his Kaiser employees a lesson (don&#39;t you dare go out on<br/>\nstrike at one of my plants) by laying them all off for 4 months and then<br/>\nselling his power block for a $32 MILLION profit.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, let&#39;s talk about good ol&#39; Cheney and the 40 to 50 natural gas wells<br/>\ndrilled in and around this supposed home state that are capped and not being<br/>\nused.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, there is plenty of power to be generated, the only problem is there is<br/>\na big profit to be made on things such as wind farms, so no one is rushing<br/>\nout to build them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we could always talk about folks such as Ultra-Power who did a cut off<br/>\nyour nose to spit your face game when they shut down their power<br/>\nplants--they shut down their scrap burning plants because they wanted to<br/>\nburn tires.  Gee, I guess that was very NIMBY of the local residents (NOT<br/>\nenvironmentalists), I mean, how short sited not to want your house, yard and<br/>\ncars covered with black soot and wanting to be able to breath without a<br/>\nventilator.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as to being local.  Perhaps you could tell that to folks on the east<br/>\ncoast that are paying $500 a month and more for heating this winter.  Or<br/>\nperhaps you would care to tell the folks in SD, ND and the Four Corners who<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t afford propane this winter and the folks who froze to death.  And<br/>\nyou can tell that to the folks in NY who are being warned right now to<br/>\nexpect the same (rolling blackouts) this summer.

I&#39;m sure the pesticides aren&#39;t worse than<br/>\n&gt; _Silent Spring_ days.  And there&#39;s all this organically grown food you can<br/>\nbuy<br/>\n&gt; now!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for gene modification... rant time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The question of whether GMOs are safe is, in a sense, meaningless.  It<br/>\ndepends<br/>\n&gt; on what the modification _is_.  Obviously if you put belladonna poison<br/>\ngenes<br/>\n&gt; into a potato the potato isn&#39;t going to be safe!  Of course, the companies<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t do anything that stupid.  Is it possible that some other<br/>\nmodifications<br/>\n&gt; might have odd side effects, or limit food value, since we don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; everything about how nutrients are absorbed?  Yes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the other hand, the belief some people have that genetically modified<br/>\nfood<br/>\n&gt; is inherently bad is simply crap science.  Our &quot;natural&quot; food, animal and<br/>\n&gt; vegetable, is quite removed from its wild form, and cells don&#39;t care where<br/>\n&gt; their genes come from.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And when we&#39;re contemplating the possible riskiness of GM food, consider<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; other risks in life.  Any obvious poisons, and hopefully allergens, aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; going to be put into the food, so the most likely drawback is a bit of<br/>\nextra<br/>\n&gt; carcinogenicity, on top of the carcinogens already in the food naturally,<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; top of the pesticides, on top of the for-most-Americans much bigger risks<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; eating too much saturated fat and sugar, and not enough fruit and<br/>\nvegetables,<br/>\n&gt; and not getting enough exercise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not that cancer is good.  But I&#39;m saying _if something goes wrong_ the<br/>\nmost<br/>\n&gt; likely risk is a slightly increased chance of cancer.  This is something<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; worry about after changing your diet and stopping smoking and starting<br/>\n&gt; exercising, because heart disease is a lot more likely to kill you than<br/>\n&gt; cancer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, I admit that in the era of mad cow disease prions there are other<br/>\nthings<br/>\n&gt; to worry about, and sometimes I feel the companies are a bit too sanguine<br/>\n&gt; about our food supply.  But I don&#39;t like seeing unscientific fear of<br/>\ngenetic<br/>\n&gt; engineering or cloning, either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; End rant.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; back, and rolling power blackouts. Hmmm, we&#39;re not quite there yet, but<br/>\ngive<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The rolling blackouts would be more relevant if they were related to a<br/>\n&gt; systematic shortage of power and overconsumption of energy.  In fact<br/>\n&gt; California is 47th in power usage, partly because of mild climate but also<br/>\n&gt; because of aggressive conservation measures -- starting from the 1970s.<br/>\nAnd<br/>\n&gt; the lack of power is not from some global shortage but because we haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; built any plants in a decade.

Also, only<br>ONE power plants was stopped \n  in CA by the environmentalists.&nbsp; Personally, I<br>wish they had been able \n  to stop a few more.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never seen such stupidity<br>in all my life as \n  building nuclear power plants on active earthquake faults!<br><br>How about if \n  we put some of the blame where it belongs, right directly into<br>the lap of a \n  Republican govenor who had aspirations of running for president<br>and who got \n  taken by some folks that turned around and put their money in<br>the Dumbya \n  coffers for his run for president.&nbsp; Let&#39;s take the $100,000<br>clubers \n  and name some names.&nbsp; Let&#39;s look at fat cats such as Kenneth Lay,<br>CEO \n  of Enron Corp and Steve Ledbetter, CEO of Reliant Energy.&nbsp; These \n  two<br>bought up a large number of the power plants when they were put up for \n  sale<br>and have been systematically/deliberatly shutting down the plants to \n  drive<br>up the prices.&nbsp; Let&#39;s talk Hurowitz (Maxxam) who owned blocks of \n  power, who<br>decided to teach his Kaiser employees a lesson (don&#39;t you dare \n  go out on<br>strike at one of my plants) by laying them all off for 4 months \n  and then<br>selling his power block for a $32 MILLION profit.<br><br>Hey, \n  let&#39;s talk about good ol&#39;

Worse than the 1960s and 1970s?&nbsp; I&#39;m sure \n  the pesticides aren&#39;t worse than<br>&gt; _Silent Spring_ days.&nbsp; And \n  there&#39;s all this organically grown food you can<br>buy<br>&gt; \n  now!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As for gene modification... rant time.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n  The question of whether GMOs are safe is, in a sense, meaningless.&nbsp; \n  It<br>depends<br>&gt; on what the modification _is_.&nbsp; Obviously if you \n  put belladonna poison<br>genes<br>&gt; into a potato the potato isn&#39;t going to \n  be safe!&nbsp; Of course, the companies<br>&gt; don&#39;t do anything that \n  stupid.&nbsp; Is it possible that some other<br>modifications<br>&gt; might \n  have odd side effects, or limit food value, since we don&#39;t know<br>&gt; \n  everything about how nutrients are absorbed?&nbsp; Yes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On the \n  other hand, the belief some people have that genetically \n  modified<br>food<br>&gt; is inherently bad is simply crap science.&nbsp; Our \n  &quot;natural&quot; food, animal and<br>&gt; vegetable, is quite removed from its wild \n  form, and cells don&#39;t care where<br>&gt; their genes come \n  from.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And when we&#39;re contemplating the possible riskiness of \n  GM food, consider<br>the<br>&gt; other risks in life.&nbsp; Any obvious \n  poisons, and hopefully allergens, aren&#39;t<br>&gt; going to be put into the \n  food, so the most likely drawback is a bit of<br>extra<br>&gt; \n  carcinogenicity, on top of the carcinogens already in the food \n  naturally,<br>on<br>&gt; top of the pesticides, on top of the \n  for-most-Americans much bigger risks<br>of<br>&gt; eating too much saturated \n  fat and sugar, and not enough fruit and<br>vegetables,<br>&gt; and not getting \n  enough exercise.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Not that cancer is good.&nbsp; But I&#39;m saying \n  _if something goes wrong_ the<br>most<br>&gt; likely risk is a slightly \n  increased chance of cancer.&nbsp; This is something<br>you<br>&gt; worry about \n  after changing your diet and stopping smoking and starting<br>&gt; exercising, \n  because heart disease is a lot more likely to kill you than<br>&gt; \n  cancer.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Now, I admit that in the era of mad cow disease prions \n  there are other<br>things<br>&gt; to worry about, and sometimes I feel the \n  companies are a bit too sanguine<br>&gt; about our food supply.&nbsp; But I \n  don&#39;t like seeing unscientific fear of<br>genetic<br>&gt; engineering or \n  cloning, either.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; End rant.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; back, and \n  rolling power blackouts. Hmmm, we&#39;re not quite there yet, \n  but<br>give<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The rolling blackouts would be more relevant if \n  they were related to a<br>&gt; systematic shortage of power and \n  overconsumption of energy.&nbsp; In fact<br>&gt; California is 47th in power \n  usage, partly because of mild climate but also<br>&gt; because of aggressive \n  conservation measures -- starting from the 1970s.<br>And<br>&gt; the lack of \n  power is not from some global shortage but because we haven&#39;t<br>&gt; built \n  any plants in a decade.&nbsp; Because we&#39;re so democratic (as in \n  popular<br>&gt; input into everything) and environmentalist (trying to get \n  that clean air<br>and<br>&gt; water back, after the 1970s) that no one&#39;s been \n  able to build one.&nbsp; And<br>&gt; deregulation wasn&#39;t designed very well, \n  and there&#39;s evidence of power<br>&gt; suppliers trying to cut supply and raise \n  prices.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes, it&#39;s a big problem here, but seeing it as a sign \n  of oncoming doom is<br>&gt; unsupportable.&nbsp; This is a specifically \n  political local fuckup.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -xx- Damien X-)<br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Message \n  boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br>Check it all out at: \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br><br>Addresses:<br>Post \n  message: Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com<br>Unsubscribe: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br>List owner: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com<br>List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!

I&#39;m sure the pesticides aren&#39;t worse than<br/>\n_Silent Spring_ days.  And there&#39;s all this organically grown food you can buy<br/>\nnow!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for gene modification... rant time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe question of whether GMOs are safe is, in a sense, meaningless.  It depends<br/>\non what the modification _is_.  Obviously if you put belladonna poison genes<br/>\ninto a potato the potato isn&#39;t going to be safe!  Of course, the companies<br/>\ndon&#39;t do anything that stupid.  Is it possible that some other modifications<br/>\nmight have odd side effects, or limit food value, since we don&#39;t know<br/>\neverything about how nutrients are absorbed?  Yes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, the belief some people have that genetically modified food<br/>\nis inherently bad is simply crap science.  Our &quot;natural&quot; food, animal and<br/>\nvegetable, is quite removed from its wild form, and cells don&#39;t care where<br/>\ntheir genes come from.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when we&#39;re contemplating the possible riskiness of GM food, consider the<br/>\nother risks in life.  Any obvious poisons, and hopefully allergens, aren&#39;t<br/>\ngoing to be put into the food, so the most likely drawback is a bit of extra<br/>\ncarcinogenicity, on top of the carcinogens already in the food naturally, on<br/>\ntop of the pesticides, on top of the for-most-Americans much bigger risks of<br/>\neating too much saturated fat and sugar, and not enough fruit and vegetables,<br/>\nand not getting enough exercise.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that cancer is good.  But I&#39;m saying _if something goes wrong_ the most<br/>\nlikely risk is a slightly increased chance of cancer.  This is something you<br/>\nworry about after changing your diet and stopping smoking and starting<br/>\nexercising, because heart disease is a lot more likely to kill you than<br/>\ncancer.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I admit that in the era of mad cow disease prions there are other things<br/>\nto worry about, and sometimes I feel the companies are a bit too sanguine<br/>\nabout our food supply.  But I don&#39;t like seeing unscientific fear of genetic<br/>\nengineering or cloning, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd rant.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; back, and rolling power blackouts. Hmmm, we&#39;re not quite there yet, but give<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The rolling blackouts would be more relevant if they were related to a<br/>\nsystematic shortage of power and overconsumption of energy.  In fact<br/>\nCalifornia is 47th in power usage, partly because of mild climate but also<br/>\nbecause of aggressive conservation measures -- starting from the 1970s.  And<br/>\nthe lack of power is not from some global shortage but because we haven&#39;t<br/>\nbuilt any plants in a decade.  Because we&#39;re so democratic (as in popular<br/>\ninput into everything) and environmentalist (trying to get that clean air and<br/>\nwater back, after the 1970s) that no one&#39;s been able to build one.  And<br/>\nderegulation wasn&#39;t designed very well, and there&#39;s evidence of power<br/>\nsuppliers trying to cut supply and raise prices.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it&#39;s a big problem here, but seeing it as a sign of oncoming doom is<br/>\nunsupportable.
