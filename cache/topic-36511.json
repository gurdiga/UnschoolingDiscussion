Igot tired of the kids complaining about what I made.<br/>\nI told them that it hurt my feelings to hear the complaints as I spent a lot<br/>\nof time, energy and love cooking their meals. &quot;Take it or leave it&quot; was way<br/>\ntoo harsh for us, it reminds me too much of eat what I made, even though you<br/>\ndon&#39;t like it or starve. So I asked for them to at least taste it, and if it<br/>\nwas not okay to go make a PB sandwich. I was not interested in making a<br/>\nvariety of meals but had no problem with them helping themselves. Max (3) is<br/>\nof course too young to make a PB sandwich so I don&#39;t mind being a little<br/>\nmore accomodating for him. There are many choices Between eat what I made<br/>\nbecasue It&#39;s what *I* wanted to make and go eat whatever.<br/>\nLOL Here&#39;s an example of strewing relating to food.<br/>\nGuess what Max just wanted for breakfast!!<br/>\nICE CREAM! so what did he get?<br/>\nIce cream and a bowl of mandarin oranges (Del Monte in the JAR--MMMMMM!!!!<br/>\nTry some)<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t ask for the oranges, I&#39;m not forcing him but they are there and he<br/>\nmay eat them. He also ate a granola bar earlier. Even mainstream<br/>\nPediatricians will tell you to look at a childs diet over a week long period<br/>\nto determine their nutrition.<br/>\n~Elissa Cleaveland, who just went into the dining room to pick up a fork Max<br/>\ndropped and the ice cream was sitting and melting and the oranges were<br/>\nhalf-gone. &quot;Mm!&quot; He said. Even a three year old can be trusted to make food<br/>\nchoices.<br/>\n&quot;It is nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction<br/>\nhave<br/>\nnot yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry.&quot; A.
