School started here last Monday, and the Sunday<br/>\nbefore that, Wal-Mart was JAMMED with stressed out moms and jittery kids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The kids were amazed that so many kids were buying paper!  hehehe  We<br/>\npicked up the school list for the school they would be attending and read<br/>\nover the supply list out of curiosity.  This last week, we drove by on our<br/>\nway to the Sam Davis Home to take pictures of the corn and there were kids<br/>\noutside running around.  I asked my oldest if he felt sad about not being<br/>\nwith them and he said, &quot;No, I just feel sad that they have to go.  Mom?  Can<br/>\nwe go to the park and ride bikes and look for bugs?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess he has no feelings about it, since he has never gone, but I found<br/>\nmyself looking forward to the start of school.  There are less kids out and<br/>\nit seems the &#39;bullies&#39; are ALL mysteriously gone!  Now the kids can play on<br/>\nthe playground and use the pool in our community without a kid twice their<br/>\nage and half their intellect bossing them around...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It also seems that once school starts, we are able to get back on more of<br/>\na schedule.  It seems everything child-related revolves around school hours<br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, maybe I don&#39;t get the same ones you do-but I DO have some<br/>\nback-to-school feelings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Esther<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 5<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 23 Aug 2001 09:29:29 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolr2@...\">unschoolr2@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: some of you may be interested.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; sorry if I already sent this out....

School started here last Monday, and the Sunday<br/>\n&gt; before that, Wal-Mart was JAMMED with stressed out moms and jittery kids.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The kids were amazed that so many kids were buying paper!  hehehe  We<br/>\n&gt; picked up the school list for the school they would be attending and read<br/>\n&gt; over the supply list out of curiosity.  This last week, we drove by on our<br/>\n&gt; way to the Sam Davis Home to take pictures of the corn and there were kids<br/>\n&gt; outside running around.  I asked my oldest if he felt sad about not being<br/>\n&gt; with them and he said, &quot;No, I just feel sad that they have to go.  Mom?<br/>\nCan<br/>\n&gt; we go to the park and ride bikes and look for bugs?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I guess he has no feelings about it, since he has never gone, but I<br/>\nfound<br/>\n&gt; myself looking forward to the start of school.  There are less kids out<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; it seems the &#39;bullies&#39; are ALL mysteriously gone!  Now the kids can play<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; the playground and use the pool in our community without a kid twice their<br/>\n&gt; age and half their intellect bossing them around...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It also seems that once school starts, we are able to get back on more<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; a schedule.  It seems everything child-related revolves around school<br/>\nhours<br/>\n&gt; anyway.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, maybe I don&#39;t get the same ones you do-but I DO have some<br/>\n&gt; back-to-school feelings.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Esther<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!

There was another one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with a teen girl trying on all of her newest clothes and admiring<br/>\n&gt; &gt; herself, and her mom comes in and says, &quot;you&#39;re not going to school<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like that!&quot; (the girl was wearing hip huggers), so the mom walks up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to her and pulls the pants down another inch!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My dh and I were just rolling our eyes.....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Janet, mom to Caroline, 6, and Thomas, almost 3!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!

I recieve flack on our<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling all the time. I am the closes thing to a radical in my<br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n&gt; hehehehe... I am always hearing and reading  of people trying to explain<br/>\n&gt; their choice to unschool. As for me, I haven&#39;t bothered telling anyone. We<br/>\n&gt; started out doing school at home and have gradually come into unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; We have been &quot;at it&quot; for three years now, and I haven&#39;t told anyone. They<br/>\n&gt; all assume I do school at home, I let them assume. If I am ever asked I<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; give a truthful answer, but until then....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is this bad? Is there a reason I should explain my choices to others? Is<br/>\n&gt; this a sign that I am really a chicken? :) Well, the last statement is<br/>\ntrue,<br/>\n&gt; at least in regards to my mom. (an over bearing woman, who only sees black<br/>\n&gt; and white, I love her and know she means well, but I shake at the thought<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; her anger). When I talk to other people I will state my beliefs and<br/>\n&gt; opinions, from there I allow them to say what they please, for I know in<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; heart what is right for my family. And I secretly feel sorry for people<br/>\nwho<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t see the joy in my life or find the happiness in their children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Sheri<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; mom to Mike 13, David 8 1/2, Andrew 7, Joshua 5, and Tirzah&#39; she is 3.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 25<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 23 Aug 2001 15:43:00 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: just thinking...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last years was the commercial where they hauled the kids shopping and the<br/>\n&gt; dad was estatic.

Oh<br/>\n&gt; boy do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I dislike those things... what is the matter with people that they think<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this is ok?  What is this saying to their children??????

I feel the exact same way whenever I<br/>\nhear<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I can&#39;t wait until they go back to school&quot; bit. I even have gotten<br/>\ninto<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tiff or two over it as I haven&#39;t quite learned how to bit down on my<br/>\n&gt; tongue.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hear my closest friends say this and I try to lovingly help them<br/>\n&gt; realize<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what it is that they are saying. The tiffs I&#39;ve gotten into were<br/>\nonline<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; over and over people are saying it and finally I can&#39;t take hearing<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; say this about their own children. It&#39;s so frustrating and at times I<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; literally bit my tongue to keep quiet. And to think I was once one of<br/>\n&gt; these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people.
