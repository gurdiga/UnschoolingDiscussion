My weatherbug says its down to 105.

I am in the sticks<br/>\n&gt; approximately 100 miles from both SA and Austin.  Actually we are 21 miles<br/>\n&gt; to Llano and 21 miles to Fredericksburg.  As soon as we can find good jobs<br/>\n&gt; and get our place (21 acres, house, antique log cabin, and several<br/>\n&gt; outbuildings) on the market, we are heading for the Pacific Northwest.<br/>\n&gt; Their highs in the daytime are lower than our lows at night.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Melodie :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12630,"nextTopicId":12662}}
