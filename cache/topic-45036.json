Low patience level <br/>\n  b.. Displays aggression <br/>\n  c.. Increasing difficulties with peer relationships <br/>\n  d.. Gradually become more openly defiant towards adults&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n***My son had these &#39;symptoms&#39; during kindergarten and we were advised by his kindergarten teacher to have him tested.  We did and he was diagnosed with ADHD and ODD.  They strongly recommended medicating him but we pulled him out of school instead.  I just could not believe that my child was &#39;not right&#39;......he just seemed (to me) to behave like a 5 y/o little boy.  ??<br/>\nAnyway, we kept him home for a year and he seemed to really mature and calm down some so he was able to handle the school situation.  In fact, he was wanting to go back to school.  I had to go back to work, so homeschooling wasn&#39;t an option at that time.  He did fine for the second half of 1st grade, all of 2nd grade, and some of 3rd.  By semester of 3rd grade, the problems really started again with the school system.  He seemed so depressed so we took him to counseling to see if that might help.  (My brother was murdered when my son was 3 1/2 and I think it had a large impact on him besides all of the family hx of depression/bipolar disorders).  She recommended medicating him for depression and we went to the psychiatrist for a scrip...... What a joke.  (Can you hear the bitterness in my typing??)  We spent about 5 minutes with him and he told us to try this medication and Alex would be like a different child in about a week.   That&#39;s it.  No warnings about what to watch for, nothing.  We had fought so hard against medication we he was 5 and now I thought that we had tried just about everything else so this wouldn&#39;t be too bad of an idea, would it??  Well, he did change almost overnight.  He seemed happier that he had ever been, slept about 5-6 hours a night, he quit eating so much (comfort eating--he is chubby so for us, less of an appetite was kind of a good thing), he played outside much more--very active, then the real problems started................. He ended up stealing a cd-rom from the school bookfair and threatened a child (he offered to kill her and chop her head off if she wouldn&#39;t leave him alone).  This was not my child!!  We promptly discontinued the meds. and he was back to &#39;normal&#39;.   What a scary time.  He was never in trouble at school before and I think this was just another blow to his already fragile self esteem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy whole point in this long drama is that we tried to follow their rules about how to help my child instead of listening to my heart (as we know now is the best policy).  My son is now 9 1/2 and we have been totally unschooling for the past 4 months.  He is much more confident in his self, he is respectful toward others, he has overcome the anger problems he had when he was 5-6, he is very compassionate, and he now even enjoys the morning snuggle time.  He was one of those babies that hated to be held.  I have often wondered if it was because he developed pneumonia at birth and was in PICU for a week before he could be held.  I asked one of the counselors that and she denied that that could be a factor.  ???<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has recently decided he wanted a mohawk so I got out my trusty clippers and gave him a new hairdo.   This child has blossomed away from the criticism of his school system friends.   No medication needed here.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Elementary (6-11 years) <br/>\n  a.. Behaviors may continue across home, school, and community settings. <br/>\n  b.. Beginning academic problems. <br/>\n  c.. Impulsivity and motor restlessness. <br/>\n  d.. Variety of disruptive and aggressive behavioral difficulties.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe counselor we took him to said that it was obvious that Alex did not have ADHD nor ODD that had been previously diagnosed.  I think that the criteria is too vague and subject to interpretation by the examiner for both of these &#39;disorders&#39;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to share my son&#39;s story to hopefully help other to see that the &#39;experts&#39; aren&#39;t always right.  In fact, in my experience with many different doctors, psychiatrists, and counselors, they have only made things worse for our family.  I realize that not all of these professionals are as incompetent as the ones I have dealt with, so this is not a general statement, but a personal experience.  I have found that patience, compassion, love, and understanding have worked best for us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKimber<br/>\nmomma to ds 9, dd 6<br/>\nLiving, learning, and loving every day<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10294444,"authorName":"Myranda","from":"&quot;Myranda&quot; &lt;myrandab@...&gt;","profile":"randascloudream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] ODD","postDate":"1033650231","msgId":45182,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMTIwMWMyNmFkZCQ1M2IwYWY0MCQwMTNmZmVhOUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDAzLjAwMDcwMC4tNDg0OTg3LjAuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":45167,"nextInTopic":45195,"prevInTime":45181,"nextInTime":45183,"topicId":45036,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I had never heard of ODD until about 3/4 months ago when an online friend of mine had her son diagnosed with it.

Variety of disruptive and aggressive behavioral difficulties. <br/>\nMy son displayed every one of these points at the appropriate age. As a baby over the age of 4mths, he would not let me hold him unless I was carrying him somewhere he wanted to go. He would scream until I put him down. He wanted nothing to do with hugs or kisses when hurt or upset, and the only way to calm him would be a car ride. He never got on any kind of an eating or napping schedule - it just went with his moods. From the time he was 2mths until he was potty trained, he would get mad if he had to have is diaper changed or clothes put on or off - he would scream, hold his breath, kick and hit. As a two year old, I could not leave him with anyone because he would hit, kick, and refuse to listen to them. I had to be sure and have enough activities to keep him busy at all times if I wanted him to be at all pleasant to be around. About the time he turned three, he would hit and kick whatever was near when he could not have what he wanted - he still does this, goes into his room and just whallops his bed, dresser, toys, whatever. He did not have the ability to wait patiently for anything, and still does not most days. He started being actively agressive towards his brother and DH when he was 4 - he would growl and ball his fists up, used any excuse to hit his brother and hurt the cats, anything, no matter how much he wanted and liked it, got broken/destroyed at some point or another. He lies for no reason (I didn&#39;t paint that yellow, I painted it red! I don&#39;t have any clean clothes in my closet. Nana told me I couldn&#39;t go to her house today.), he steals things - started with taking food off other&#39;s plates when they weren&#39;t looking and sneaking into my change jar in my bathroom, went to trying to take other children&#39;s toys and even clothes, and he has tried taking a few things from stores. Ugh, and so much more! <br/>\n<br/>\nThe ODD info has given me a whole new world of ideas to try! A lot of them I was already doing, but a few new ones have really helped us.<br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n  What do you see as signs of ODD in a newborn or infant?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think there are definitely some babies who are more difficult to care<br/>\n  for. Some are less cuddly than others, some are more sensitive to stress.<br/>\n  Some are very erratic in their habits, or very active, or more intense in<br/>\n  their reactions, or slower to adjust to changes or to warm up to new<br/>\n  people and places. When my daughter was a baby, she had some of these<br/>\n  traits, and people did tend to pathologize her behaviors - calling her<br/>\n  &quot;spirited&quot; and &quot;high-need&quot; before she was even a year old. I did read<br/>\n  some books and find them helpful (&quot;The Explosive Child&quot; really made me<br/>\n  feel better when she was 5 or 6) but labeling her never helped. What did<br/>\n  help was to adjust to her difficulties, to stay on her side, to be honest<br/>\n  with her....<br/>\n<br/>\n  I worked with adults and kids who had emotional and mental health<br/>\n  problems for quite a few years. Before being a teacher of kids with<br/>\n  emotional &quot;disorders&quot;, I worked at a drop in center for people with<br/>\n  serious mental illnesses, on the grounds of the state hospital. The only<br/>\n  thing I ever did that helped anyone was to talk with them, to have<br/>\n  compassion, and to be on their side. The school system especially was<br/>\n  about control - with regular kids they get sneaky, with my kids they<br/>\n  fight back as hard as they can, and they fight dirty. But once we got to<br/>\n  know each other, I could pretty much ask them to do anything in their<br/>\n  power and they would do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One day I was working at the drop-in center, and we were having a<br/>\n  Valentine&#39;s day party and cookout. The other person who was supposed to<br/>\n  be working with me died in his sleep the night before - he was in his<br/>\n  forties and seemingly healthy, it was totally unexpected. I ended up<br/>\n  working by myself that day, me and 45 people who were either residents of<br/>\n  the state hospital or in the system and diagnosed with a serious mental<br/>\n  illness. One woman showed up high as a kite, and some of the things she<br/>\n  said made us think she&#39;d taken an overdose. She was terrified, too... so<br/>\n  I ended up putting her in my car and driving her to county crisis,<br/>\n  leaving a large schizophrenic homeless guy who rarely said two words in<br/>\n  charge of the grill. I was gone maybe an hour... and when I got back<br/>\n  there were burgers made, one of the women was making coffee, everyone was<br/>\n  having a good time. Everyone had been concerned about the woman and<br/>\n  wanted me to go, and they said they could handle things, and I believed<br/>\n  them. <br/>\n<br/>\n  In my class, I had a 5th grader whose family was known for drug dealing<br/>\n  and manufacturing, being in and out of jail, wild parties... he had been<br/>\n  in trouble for fighting and &quot;acting out&quot; since kindergarten. He was truly<br/>\n  my right-hand man, more help than my horrid aide. He noticed when the 3rd<br/>\n  graders were struggling and would ask if they could come work at his desk<br/>\n  with him. He noticed when my student with sickle cell was needing a<br/>\n  transfusion, when she was having trouble concentrating. All I did was<br/>\n  treat him with respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There was one sub who loved my room. Most would come in and feel<br/>\n  intimidated, and try to have a &quot;firm hand&quot; and take control... which<br/>\n  usually backfired, although after I&#39;d had the kids for a while they at<br/>\n  least tried. But usually we got the same guy. No one thought he&#39;d make a<br/>\n  good sub for my kids, because he was skinny and old  and walked slowly<br/>\n  and no way could he restain a kid who decided to throw chairs or<br/>\n  something... but he talked to the kids like real people, told them<br/>\n  stories about fighting in WW II, read to them, showed them how to paint.<br/>\n  It was wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It wasn&#39;t all perfect - kids did lose it, so did the adults I worked<br/>\n  with.
