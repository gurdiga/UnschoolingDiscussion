I was surprised that the office was ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-669435591\">We went to see the lady in Santa Monica (number three in the Surgeon search)<br/>\non Wednesday arriving in plenty of time. I was surprised that the office was<br/>\nso�.officey. Not painted fun or with posters, but there were toys.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Jayn was equally negative and refused to open her mouth, saying<br/>\nrepeatedly that she just wanted to go home. Again I think it was partly<br/>\ntiredness, however I have been observing, talking to Jayn and thinking hard,<br/>\nand I believe I have gotten to the &quot;root&quot; of the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs soon as the dentist saw that Jayn was reluctant she said to her that<br/>\nJames and I would have to go out unless Jayn got in the chair and opened her<br/>\nmouth. So unfortunately she began by making a threat, that I was certainly<br/>\nstartled by given the talking up we had received, and not remotely prepared<br/>\nto back up. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a mistake that Jayn was not prepared to forgive. Instead I took Jayn<br/>\nto the bathroom to talk it over with her. She sort of agreed to let the<br/>\ndoctor look, but then changed her mind in the hallway saying she did not<br/>\nlike the dentist. She sat on my lap and cried a lot. We tried looking at<br/>\nphotos, and the dentist talked about her two daughters, but the damage had<br/>\nbeen done. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJames talked to her while Jayn and I were out, and explained more about our<br/>\nparenting philosophy. I think part of the problem is in the phrases along<br/>\nthe lines of &quot;meet the dentist&quot;. Jayn is viewing that as saying hello,<br/>\nchatting, shaking hands, talking. The dentists are seeing &quot;just saying hi&quot;<br/>\nas a consultation where Jayn immediately sits in the chair and opens her<br/>\nmouth but no procedures are done.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe dentist today made a lot of suggestions about buying a little mirror and<br/>\nplayacting being at the dentist with Jayn at home so that she could get used<br/>\nto the idea. That would be fine, except that that is not the problem. Jayn<br/>\nwas perfectly fine with everything that was done last week - polishing,<br/>\nsuction, scraping, fluoride application, flossing, pointy tools, a full set<br/>\nof x-rays plus one extra of the bad tooth, 3 different people in her mouth.<br/>\nShe also shows me her mouth all the time, and lets me feel, and help her<br/>\nwith Ambesol (pain relief).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, the root of the problem is *not* that Jayn fears the dentist, or even<br/>\nany idea of pain, which we have repeatedly assured her will be prevented. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Jayn is fearing is the loss of her autonomy - being forced to accept<br/>\ntreatment from someone she doesn&#39;t like or hasn&#39;t chosen - so she is<br/>\nfighting hard.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that James and I have been making it more stressful than we should,<br/>\nby not listening to Jayn&#39;s &quot;no&quot; immediately and leaving immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAll the docs have given us the impression that it would very fast, but their<br/>\nrationale seems to be that the brevity or simplicity of the surgery<br/>\njustifies rushing Jayn through the preliminary stuff and pushing her along,<br/>\nas if it were all fuss over nothing. Unfortunately I think I have allowed<br/>\nthat attitude to permeate my *cajoling and persuasions* with her, something<br/>\nthat I became determined to STOP now. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have decided to express it this way, more simply and clearly:<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn *must* have this work done. She has the choice, within certain<br/>\nparameters like geography and ever decreasing time frame, of *who* will do<br/>\nthe work. We will respect her choice to leave at once, which was our error<br/>\nand I apologized already to her, and talk over the different places<br/>\nafterward.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is how I approached her medicine. She *has to* take it, but she has the<br/>\nchoice of how to make it more palatable. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat she wants is to go back to the original place, or, her next ingenious<br/>\nsolution, for the nice ladies to come to the next dentist&#39;s place. Hmmm,<br/>\nmaybe that would not be totally impossible if we had enough money to achieve<br/>\nit. However James is pretty irritated with that place because he feels that<br/>\nthe other place has a policy of sending the really traumatic stuff out so<br/>\nthat they stay the nice, happy place - unlike that idea of bringing someone<br/>\nin once a month as some other folk do.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSooooo, we next have an *afternoon* (yay) appointment with my SIL&#39;s dentist,<br/>\nwho we will be meeting, and we have explained to Jayn, getting her to<br/>\nreflect back to us so we knew she understood, that it really must include<br/>\nsitting in the chair and opening her mouth. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have yet one more lady referral from the dentist today if this doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork out, but we have explained to Jayn that her options are really and<br/>\ntruly running out. We expect that this next place will have more of a happy<br/>\natmosphere. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m beginning to think that the best idea would have been to schedule a<br/>\ndozen or more purely walk in and say hello (literally) visits with a bunch<br/>\nof unlikely candidates, until Jayn got all her &quot;no&#39;s&quot; out. I had been so<br/>\nmisguidedly reassured by her great experience/behavior at the first office<br/>\nthat I assumed her willingness would continue. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next section I entitled Eureka when I posted on my local list � a place<br/>\nwhere people are always looking for nice, genuinely kid friendly dentists.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have found a lovely, RESPECTFUL lady ped dentist � full service in her<br/>\noffice - with what may be the coolest kid friendly waiting room in all<br/>\ncreation.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe waiting room features a tree in the corner with the kids play area being<br/>\na tree house where they climb up a kid size spiral staircase to find a<br/>\nlittle kitchen, and then a basement going down below the main floor with two<br/>\nlittle cubby hole rooms - and another little kitchen. The ceilings and walls<br/>\nare painted with the branches and leaves of said tree with little surprises<br/>\nin the painting like butterflies and a wormy apple. There are also a wide<br/>\nage range selection of loose toys, a video monitor that was playing a<br/>\nclassic family film when we arrived, and an arcade style computer game stand<br/>\ndown a little hall so that it was visible from the waiting area but not<br/>\nintrusive or loud. They also have a nice selection of current issue<br/>\nmagazines for the adults and a clean restroom right in there (instead of<br/>\ndown the hall by the elevator and don&#39;t forget the key).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJust inside the reception area is a the &quot;Magic Prize Tree&quot;, another tree<br/>\nwith a glassed in cupboard with far and away the coolest prizes we have seen<br/>\nyet - no tatty 99 cent store trash here! Jayn chose a lovely princess crown<br/>\nwith marabou feathers on it before she even realized that it had colored<br/>\nmoving lights that work in it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn was immediately entranced upon entry and dashed off to play. We went<br/>\nearly, to fill out the now very familiar paperwork and to let Jayn<br/>\nacclimatize, which was the only reason why we met up with another patient -<br/>\ntwo boys including one with autism who seemed very happy and familiar with<br/>\nthe place. We had an hour scheduled. The receptionist was friendly, kindly<br/>\nand altogether gave me the impression that she couldn&#39;t be happier in her<br/>\nworkplace. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe dentist *came out* to the waiting room to meet us. That in itself is<br/>\nextraordinary. She sat with us *in the waiting room* to talk over the recent<br/>\nsituation and get to know Jayn. When Jayn came over and the dentist wanted<br/>\nto touch her cheek, Jayn instantly opened her mouth wide and the dentist had<br/>\nto ask her to close it. :-) Jayn let her find the sore spot on her face.<br/>\nJayn answered all her questions happily. I&#39;m starting to cry (again) just<br/>\nremembering how wonderful it was after the bad experiences with Oral<br/>\nSurgeons. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went in back to the examining room, which is very open plan seeming.<br/>\nThere are only two rooms, divided by a partition. On the wall was a framed<br/>\nBarbie dentist with Kelly in a seat that Jayn enjoyed seeing. On the ceiling<br/>\nwas a DVD monitor playing &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. We were invited to bring<br/>\nour own DVD next time if we wished. There were enough chairs for both James<br/>\nand I to sit with her in the room.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn hopped into the chair without difficulty and opened her mouth. The<br/>\ndentist had the idea that Jayn was timid, but I think we were able to<br/>\nexplain that it was the other dentists that Jayn hadn&#39;t liked or trusted -<br/>\nnot the procedures in general or the idea of dentistry.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe tooth will definitely have to come out. The dentist&#39;s plan is to do IV<br/>\nsedation with an injection initially (she and James had a long talk about<br/>\nall the kinds of drugs which he has a great knowledge about with names I had<br/>\nnever heard of) and do *all* the work including the fillings she needs in<br/>\none go - only about a gazillion times less traumatic. She has an anesthetist<br/>\ncome in, who ironically happens to be the wife of James and my adult<br/>\ndentist. (Why the *#%**^%# he suggested some guy other than this lady will<br/>\nbe a mystery for the ages...) <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShe also asked Jayn directly if she understood that she needed her tooth to<br/>\ncome out and would she be willing to come back. Jayn just said &quot;yes&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne problem is the increasing urgency, because the swelling began to return<br/>\nyesterday. I think that it is partly because of our bad sleep schedule I<br/>\nhave had trouble getting the antibiotic dose into her often enough to be<br/>\nfully effective. We have moved to a different stronger one (with a better<br/>\nflavor - it&#39;s like every little thing is better here). <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is some more that makes me just love this woman! She was a little<br/>\nconcerned about the infection, especially since she is not familiar with<br/>\nJayn�s face shape or skin color. She was the only person to warn us to<br/>\nmonitor Jayn&#39;s temperature and call our doctor if she raised a fever. Of<br/>\ncourse I know this but what if I hadn&#39;t? Other people had an agenda (force<br/>\nJayn) when they spoke of the dangers of untreated infection; she talked<br/>\nabout it without trying to be scary if that makes sense. The only thing that<br/>\nwill sour this deal is if Jayn&#39;s infection makes a dramatic upsurge towards<br/>\nher eye. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter we left, she phoned our pediatrician, with whom she is familiar, to<br/>\nlet him know what was happening - tbh I hadn&#39;t thought to do so. Come to<br/>\nthink of it, he may have been able to refer us to her a long time ago! They<br/>\nconferred on the dosage and the medication and she phoned the script in to<br/>\nour local pharmacy, another small gesture towards our convenience. Then she<br/>\ncalled James&#39; cel phone to ask us to come back sooner, and call the doctor.<br/>\nTomorrow we are going in again in the afternoon so that she can check the<br/>\nswelling, and stop by with our doctor up the road - who Jayn loves.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWas this paragon of wonder extraordinarily expensive, you ask? Why no. She<br/>\nhas quoted less than HALF the price of the other guy who would have an<br/>\nanesthetist come in for the extraction. Her consultation and examination was<br/>\n$20 LESS than the last lady in Santa Monica who never looked in Jayn&#39;s<br/>\nmouth. Yes the procedure will cost more with the fillings and a sealer for<br/>\nall her teeth, but still less than the FOUR other visits that the first<br/>\nclinic proposed and quoted for - not counting the spacer tooth. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn didn&#39;t want to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n***********************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I told Jayn that we were returning to the dentist sooner she was<br/>\nelated. She wouldn�t leave until she had given her a big hug.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShe was also happy to see her doctor and did a bunch of dancing and statues<br/>\nfor him.  The good news is that her swelling is receding. The new antibiotic<br/>\nis much nicer tasting too, and Jayn actually guzzles it in milk (every<br/>\nlittle thing is better). Our surgery is scheduled for Monday 26th, and I now<br/>\nhave pretty much no fears. BTW there was *no charge* for the drop in visit,<br/>\neven though we did still go back and sit in the chair.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we told our doctor about the other surgeons� impatience he was kind of<br/>\nbaffled � �But Jayn�s so easy!� he said.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSure, if she trusts and likes you. Sure, when you have protocols in place to<br/>\nmake the child feel comfortable. Sure, if you make the long term<br/>\nrelationship the priority � hence the lack of that in Oral Surgeons who are<br/>\na sporadic person in a patient�s life (hopefully).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe last installment follows after I play Barbies with Jayn for a while,<br/>\nwhere I talk about my personal �woulda/coulda/shouldas� that would be my<br/>\nsuggestions for people in similar situations. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
