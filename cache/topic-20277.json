How did you go about your <br/>\nown life?  Did you just <br/>\nfollow your own work/interests and/or hobbies and <br/>\nshe just followed along, or <br/>\ndid she do her own thing most of the time? Did <br/>\nyou mostly follow her <br/>\npursuits, or was it balanced pretty evenly <br/>\nbetween both of your interests and <br/>\npursuits? <br/>\n<br/>\nVic privately emailed me and asked me these questions and said I <br/>\ncould reply here... so...here I go...<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Vic,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll reply to your email asap.  <br/>\nI did not work when Laurie was young (or old). I was fortunate in <br/>\nthat her father had a great job that allowed me to stay home with <br/>\nher. I did babysit other kids while she was young though. I was <br/>\nmarried. <br/>\nMy own life revolved around Laurie because that is the way I wanted <br/>\nit to be. I did have other pursuits, but she was there with me. I <br/>\ngardened organically, sewed, cooked healthfoods (which we all know is <br/>\nmore time-consuming) read, and kept the house as clean as possible <br/>\nwhile babysitting.<br/>\nShe enjoyed being right by my side while she was young, but by the <br/>\ntime she was six she was more into spending time alone. Books <br/>\nwere/are her best friends. She&#39;s a bookaholic! which I encouraged of <br/>\ncourse.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a bit hard to tell the difference between our pursuits. She WAS <br/>\nmy pursuit. Everything else came second. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I need to clarify anything let me know. :-)  Valerie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20214,"nextTopicId":20241}}
