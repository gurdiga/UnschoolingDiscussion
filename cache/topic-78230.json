We also have a membership to the Hands on Museum here<br/>\nin Ann Arbor. I buy books at garage sales and I am not married to buying<br/>\nbooks they are interested in. I get books that look like they might be<br/>\ninteresting to someone in the future etc. We purchased the complete set of<br/>\nNational Geographic magazines on CD ROM along with all the maps. I have<br/>\nworkbooks because I break down sometimes and want to &quot;prove&quot; things to<br/>\nmyself (This is completely my failing but I learned that sometimes I need to<br/>\nsatisfy my inner Professor). My kids will sometimes pick them up because<br/>\nthey are interesting (we have some unusual ones, like Geography and<br/>\nAstronomy which combine reading and other skills so it is interesting for<br/>\nthem).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe buy software that looks interesting all the time too, usually used if we<br/>\ncan find it. We have counting bears for my middle son to play with (he<br/>\nadores them) and board games they like, playing cards for games of War (very<br/>\npopular here) and go fish and more advanced games. I have several books on<br/>\nnature projects in case anyone gets interested in doing an experiment. Some<br/>\ndays they will suggest it and some days I will ask if anyone is interested<br/>\nin taking a walk and then doing something with what they find. Usually it is<br/>\na yes to the walk idea. I also have a lot of cookbooks and if I start<br/>\ncooking someone might come in the kitchen and cook too. I have books on<br/>\ncraft ideas but favorite crafts are pretty adult projects around here. I<br/>\nspin and weave and both older boys have asked to learn this winter when I<br/>\npull the yarn out again. My oldest son really wants to learn karate and I am<br/>\nlooking for a good local class. The class I recently found is so regimented<br/>\nthat all the fun seems to have leeched out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have art supplies and old Paper Towel Rolls as well as the dog to play<br/>\nwith and brushes ready to go for them. So far I just try to keep stuff out<br/>\nthat might interest someone at some time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1658973,"authorName":"Barb Eaton","from":"Barb Eaton &lt;homemama@...&gt;","profile":"homesmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] what would you buy?","postDate":"1060434024","msgId":78313,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCNUE2OEE3LjFCNUMzJWhvbWVtYW1hQGluZmluZXQuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEE2REYyMTk2LUNBMkEtMTFENy1BQjVELTAwMEE5NTZFMTA5RUBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":78312,"nextInTopic":78317,"prevInTime":78312,"nextInTime":78314,"topicId":78230,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Please send that help my way too.
