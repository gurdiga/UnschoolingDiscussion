Most of us don&#39;t have our own <br/>\nnuclear arsenal to destroy the enemy, nor armies to attack another country; <br/>\nyet most of us do have the words and innuendo to attack or destroy someone <br/>\nelse; perhaps just their confidence, their peace of mind or their dreams. <br/>\nAnd if we can&#39;t destroy, we&#39;ll settle for a momentary conquest; by <br/>\none-ups-manship, a snide joke or a pseudo-concerned comment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe recently heard a story about a radio DJ who calls up famous people and <br/>\nin this particular instance called a man and pretended to be the <br/>\nveterinarian with whom he had left his dog for a claw-clipping.  The <br/>\n&quot;pretend&quot; vet told Mr. Famous he could come and pick up his pet at lunch <br/>\ntime... &quot;the anesthetic will have worn off by then.&quot;  Well, you probably <br/>\nget it by now, the &#39;vet&#39; suggested that a bogus irreversible operation had <br/>\nbeen performed on the prize-winning animal. Mr. Famous was emotionally <br/>\ndestroyed by the &quot;news&quot;, and the audience was cheering like the crowds in <br/>\nthe Roman Coliseum.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a smaller scale, how many of you recall someone destroying your <br/>\nconfidence?  Perhaps you recall having done that to someone else, when they <br/>\ntold you about their dream or new endeavor... all under the war heading of <br/>\n&quot;being concerned for the other&quot; or &quot;being reasonable&quot;. &quot;I just have to tell <br/>\nyou this... for your own good.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe may not be the Pentagon, but it seems we all have the ability to destroy <br/>\nanother bit by bit, emotionally and mentally.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the difference between our war of &quot;concern&quot; and the war with nuclear <br/>\nwarheads?  Can we ask others to stop their wars while we continue our own?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Contemplations<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Peter and Helen Evans<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25733,"nextTopicId":25676}}
