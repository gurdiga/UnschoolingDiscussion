The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-552850870\">Dear Sharon<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;As a distributor of curricula have you come in contact with many<br/>\n </span></blockquote>homeschoolers?&gt;&gt;<br/>\nNo, not as a distributor, but yes as one of the few that is actively<br/>\ninvolved with our local HS Association and HSLDA.  The internet has also<br/>\nbeen an amazing tool to bring the HS Community together though only a amall<br/>\npercentage of HS&#39;ers have internet access.  One of the reasons possibly<br/>\nbeing that we pay for all telephone calls (local too) and it&#39;s thus costly<br/>\nif not used with discretion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Are the legalities uncomfortable in SA?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.  Things are hotting up as Government does not like the free-thinkers<br/>\nthat are being raised.  They are wanting total control also with regards to<br/>\ncurriculum & teaching method (quite a nightmare for unschoolers or even unit<br/>\nstudy users).  We are expected to be satellite campuses for our local<br/>\nschools.  The new set of evaluations that our children have to pass annually<br/>\nis quite ridiculous & definitely not in our children&#39;s best interest! All<br/>\nthis will have to be contended in Court (the Ed Dept will however have the<br/>\nonus of proving that their way is indeed the only way!)  Unfortunately it&#39;s<br/>\nstressful & causing some families to put kids back into school to avoid the<br/>\nconfrontation (even though it&#39;s not in the best interest of the child!) So<br/>\nfar very few HS&#39;lers that have applied for registration (some don&#39;t, but<br/>\nstay &quot;underground&quot;) have been registered and given permission to HS (we<br/>\ndon&#39;t just &quot;inform&quot; the Education Department but have to ask &quot;permission&quot; to<br/>\nexcercise our parental duties!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Do most folks do homeschooling now or less than in the past?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re talking about before 1994 as the past (it was illegal to HS then)<br/>\nyes, far more are HS&#39;ing now.  According to figures from Curriculum<br/>\nSuppliers (the school-at-homers i.e ACE etc) there are about 25 000 families<br/>\nHS&#39;ing (though many more are still &quot;underground&quot;).  Last year however more<br/>\nHS&#39;ers wrote Matric (Gr 12 final examination before tertiary education) than<br/>\nPrivate School Students did!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;What sort of school did you grow up with? Confusing, I would guess, by the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ages of you children I put you in late twenties.&gt;&gt; I&#39;m 33 and was educated<br/>\nin various public schools, the most memorable being a small farm school (a<br/>\nThree Room School House *grin*)  I also did some Nursing, Bible School &<br/>\nstudied Law (now I&#39;d say that&#39;s confusing!!) ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I wonder if there is a way to be parents that isn&#39;t intensive?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep, there is: give birth to them and then hand them over to some Childcare<br/>\nCentre to raise them while you bury yourself (and any feelings of guilt) in<br/>\nyour Career!  You then wish weekends and school holidays away so that you<br/>\ncan just get rid of the brats & have some time to youself again...<br/>\n<br/>\nWarm regards<br/>\nAdèle in South Africa<br/>\nHS Mom to a 7yob and twin 5yob&#39;s</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22913,"nextTopicId":22874}}
