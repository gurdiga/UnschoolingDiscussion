Just<br/>\nthought I&#39;d share a couple:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son had a friend over this week for a sleepover playdate (the first time<br/>\nwe&#39;ve done this). My son is 6, his friend is 10 and also an unschooler. My<br/>\nson still needs me to lie down with him to go to sleep, so when I was<br/>\ngetting tired, I told the boys that I was going to bed and that they could<br/>\nstay up but please don&#39;t step on dd (who insisted on giving the friend her<br/>\nbed to sleep in and she slept on the floor). My son wanted to go to bed then<br/>\nso that he could snuggle to sleep with me. His older friend didn&#39;t blink an<br/>\neye and certainly never teased him or made an issue of it (from my<br/>\nexperiences as a kid with school friends, that would be a prime opportunity<br/>\nfor teasing). The boys popped out of bed at 5:45 and excitedly rushed<br/>\ndownstairs to fire up the computer and use the chess tutorial. They had only<br/>\nmade it through half of the tutorial lessons the night before and they<br/>\nreally wanted to go through all of them. So that was one of those funny<br/>\nunschooling moments I&#39;m just momentarily blown away by the things they do. I<br/>\ncan&#39;t imagine as a schooled child ever rushing out of bed before the sun<br/>\ncame up in order to do a chess tutorial!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other cool thing was last night my son was asking me what the biggest<br/>\nnumber on earth was, and I explained that there is no such thing, because<br/>\nyou can always add on to any number and make it bigger. So I mentioned the<br/>\nconcept of infinity and he just stopped still. I could almost see him just<br/>\nturning that concept over and around in his brain and after a few minutes of<br/>\nsilence (unusual for him) he said &quot;Wow mom, that idea&#39;s just too big.&quot; We<br/>\ntalked about it some more and I could see the idea starting to take real<br/>\nshape in his brain. Then I mentioned that there was a symbol for infinity<br/>\nand he surprised me by saying &quot;It&#39;s a sideways &#39;8&#39; isn&#39;t it?&quot; I have no idea<br/>\nwhere he got that from--some random unschooling connection in his brain to<br/>\nsomewhere else. I love seeing that kind of spark happen. So he drew the<br/>\nsymbol, and then I showed him how to make a moebius strip<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mathforum.org/sum95/math_and/moebius/moebius.html\">http://mathforum.org/sum95/math_and/moebius/moebius.html</a> if you don&#39;t<br/>\nremember that one from school) which came to mind while thinking of the<br/>\ninfinity symbol. We had this long interesting discussion about numbers,<br/>\ninfinity, the universe, etc. that went on as we got ready for bed and right<br/>\nup until the second he fell asleep, mid-sentence.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a couple of cool moments from the unschooling river of life. Anyone<br/>\nelse care to share theirs today?<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68603,"nextTopicId":68625}}
