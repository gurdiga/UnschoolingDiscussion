Maybe it will go away by itself. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Let me check your medical history.&quot; I want to see if you&#39;ve paid your last <br/>\n&gt; bill before spending anymore time with you. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Well, now, we have some good news and some bad news.&quot; The good news is, <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m going to buy that new BMW. The bad news is, you&#39;re going to pay for it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;This should be taken care of right away.&quot; I&#39;d planned a trip to Hawaii <br/>\n&gt; next month but this is so easy and profitable that I want to fix it before <br/>\n&gt; it cures itself. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Let me schedule you for some lab tests.&quot; I have a forty percent interest <br/>\n&gt; in the lab. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s see how it develops.&quot; Maybe in a few days it will grow into <br/>\n&gt; something that really needs to be cured.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &quot;I&#39;d like to prescribe a new drug.&quot; I&#39;m writing a paper and would like to <br/>\n&gt; use you for a guinea pig. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s quite a nasty looking wound.&quot; I think I&#39;m going to throw up. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;This may smart a little.&quot; Last week two patients almost bit off their <br/>\n&gt; tongues. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;This should fix you up.&quot; The drug company slipped me some big bucks to <br/>\n&gt; prescribe this stuff. Hope it works... <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Everything seems to be normal.&quot; Rats! I guess I can&#39;t buy that new beach <br/>\n&gt; condo after all. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;d like to run some more tests.&quot; I can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s wrong. Maybe <br/>\n&gt; the kid in the lab can solve this one. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have a great Monday...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49125,"nextTopicId":49110}}
