At <br/>\n  those times <br/>\n  &gt; &gt;&gt;my mother would encourage me (but not insist) to go, even if I <br/>\n  would <br/>\n  &gt; &gt;&gt;rather stay home; she didn&#39;t know there were other options in the <br/>\n  60&#39;s.  <br/>\n  &gt; &gt;&gt;Grades were unimportant to them.  I watched as much tv as I <br/>\n  wanted, in <br/>\n  &gt; &gt;&gt;fact, I was one of the only kids I knew who had unlimited access <br/>\n  to <br/>\n  &gt; &gt;&gt;television, including a television in my room -- and I watched a <br/>\n  lot of <br/>\n  &gt; &gt;&gt;tv!  I went to bed when I wanted, I ate what I wanted, etc...  My <br/>\n  parents <br/>\n  &gt; &gt;&gt;trusted my judgments, and let me make my own decisions.

On the days <br/>\n  you <br/>\n  &gt; stayed home, what did they do with you?<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Unschooling, even the most radical kind, does not mean leaving <br/>\n  children <br/>\n  &gt; alone  24/7. It means staying connected, presenting new ideas, <br/>\n  getting <br/>\n  &gt; excited with them over new discoveries, answering their questions <br/>\n  and asking <br/>\n  &gt; more back. It&#39;s not neglect.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Life is good.<br/>\n  &gt; ~Mary<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;Did it sound like I was neglected?  Not at all.  My parents spent <br/>\n  endless hours with us - more than any other parents I knew.  And my <br/>\n  mother, in particular, spent endless hours of focused attention <br/>\n  talking with us, listening to us, supporting us, and filling our <br/>\n  world with opportunities.  I only hope I can do the same for my <br/>\n  children.
