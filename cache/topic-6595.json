I noticed in my own first forays, which were in using the word<br/>\nprocessor and a little networking, that my thought process was decidedly<br/>\ndifferent when I wrote on the computer than when I wrote with a pen.  My<br/>\nfingers, although not rapid like a pro&#39;s are fairly fast because of<br/>\npiano playing, so the words can actually slip out faster than what my<br/>\nbrain is accustomed to in my pen writing.  I found this both exciting<br/>\nand disconcerting. I  noticed that sometimes it was just a little too<br/>\neasy to type a lot of words without my usual contemplation, again which<br/>\ncould be either good or bad, I suppose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like words.  I started to think that perhaps the possibility of a glut<br/>\nof meaningless words might actually obscure any truth there might be in<br/>\nmy communicating.  I&#39;ve  read some thoughtful writings from literary<br/>\nfigures who are wary of this same thing.  Many writers do their work in<br/>\nlong hand and then edit on the computer.  One well-respected and<br/>\nseasoned fiction writer recently said that he could tell within the<br/>\nfirst few paragraphs if a book was actually created on the computer or<br/>\nwritten by hand, and has yet to be proven wrong.  He bemoans this new<br/>\nability we now have to spew out many words very fast, and the resulting<br/>\nproliferation of not-very-well-written books.<br/>\n     I have been thinking also about highschool teachers who only accept<br/>\nassignments completed on computer word processing, graphics and other<br/>\nprograms.   When I heard about this and thought about it, I came to the<br/>\nconclusion that I would probably do the opposite -- I would want to see<br/>\nthe physical manifestation, in all its awkwardness and/or flowing<br/>\nbeauty, of a student&#39;s thought process and creativity as written with a<br/>\npen or pencil, with drawings and lines on a piece of paper.  But maybe<br/>\nI&#39;m just old ...<br/>\n     Yes, computers are a part of this reality now, and they are a<br/>\npowerful tool.  I am wondering, though, about creativity and all those<br/>\nzillions of  little spaces and thoughts and ideas that don&#39;t fit into<br/>\nthe paradigm of one program of another.  I know my daughter can be<br/>\ncreative with MSPaint, and I&#39;ve had fun with it too, but the creativity<br/>\nis within extremely limited parameters.  Is it okay for a child to type<br/>\ne-mail messages and stories on the computer if she doesn&#39;t want to learn<br/>\nto write with a pen?   I don&#39;t know.  I know that we have spent less<br/>\ntime smelling tempura, getting our hands all mucky with clay, smearing<br/>\noil pastels and making our creative picture letters for friends and<br/>\nfamily.  So I worry that forms of communicating and thinking and working<br/>\nthrough things that don&#39;t lend themselves to digital electronics may be<br/>\nused less and less.  Not a good thought.  But reveals the need for a<br/>\nbalance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I am trying to be careful about this world of computers, while<br/>\nat the same time appreciating the access it has given me to information<br/>\nand worlds I otherwise wouldn&#39;t know about, etc.   I am hoping that the<br/>\ncomputer world will evolve through the input of the most brilliantly<br/>\ncreative minds around -- probably unschoolers, who value diversity,<br/>\nautonomy, process, and all the rest ...<br/>\n<br/>\nTina in cyberlimbo.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6575,"nextTopicId":6597}}
