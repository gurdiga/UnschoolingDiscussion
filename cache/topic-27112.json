But<br/>\ninvestigators have found the usual methods have failed to persuade any<br/>\nof<br/>\nthem to talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nOptions being weighed include &quot;truth&quot; drugs, pressure tactics and<br/>\nextraditing the suspects to countries whose security services are more<br/>\nused to employing a heavy-handed approach during interrogations.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We&#39;re into this thing for 35 days and nobody is talking. Frustration<br/>\nhas<br/>\nbegun to appear,&quot; a senior FBI official told The Washington Post.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder US law, evidence extracted using physical pressure or torture is<br/>\ninadmissible in court and interrogators could also face criminal charges<br/>\n<br/>\nfor employing such methods. However, investigators suggested that the<br/>\ntime<br/>\nmight soon come when a truth serum, such as sodium pentothal, would be<br/>\ndeemed an acceptable tool for interrogators.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe public pressure for results in the war on terrorism might also<br/>\npersuade the FBI to encourage the countries of suspects to seek their<br/>\nextradition, in the knowledge that they could be given a much rougher<br/>\nreception in jails back home.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the four key suspects is Zacarias Moussaoui, a French Moroccan,<br/>\nsuspected of being a twentieth hijacker who failed to make it on board<br/>\nthe<br/>\nplane that crashed in Pennsylvania. Moussaoui was detained after he<br/>\nacted<br/>\nsuspiciously at a Minnesota flying school, requesting lessons in how to<br/>\nsteer a plane but not how to take off or land. Both Morocco and France<br/>\nare<br/>\nregarded as having harsher interrogation methods than the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe investigators have been disappointed that the usual incentives to<br/>\nbreak suspects, such as promises of shorter sentences, money, jobs and<br/>\nnew<br/>\nlives in the witness protection program, have failed to break the<br/>\nsilence.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We are known for humanitarian treatment, so basically we are stuck.<br/>\nUsually there is some incentive, some angle to play, what you can do for<br/>\n<br/>\nthem. But it could get to that spot where we could go to pressure . . .<br/>\nwhere we don&#39;t have a choice, and we are probably getting there,&quot; an FBI<br/>\n<br/>\nagent involved in the investigation told the paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other key suspects being held in New York are Mohammed Jaweed Azmath<br/>\n<br/>\nand Ayub Ali Khan, Indians who were caught the day after the attacks<br/>\ntraveling with false passports, craft knives such as those used in the<br/>\nhijackings and hair dye. Nabil Almarabh, a Boston taxi driver alleged to<br/>\n<br/>\nhave links to al-Qaeda, is also being held. Some legal experts believe<br/>\nthat the US Supreme Court, which has a conservative tilt, might be<br/>\nprepared to support curtailing the civil liberties of prisoners in<br/>\nterrorism cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, a warning that torture should be avoided came from Robert<br/>\nBlitzer, a former head of the FBI&#39;s counter-terrorism section. He said<br/>\nthat the practice &quot;goes against every grain in my body. Chances are you<br/>\nare going to get the wrong person and risk damage or killing them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all, about 800 people have been rounded up since the attacks, most of<br/>\n<br/>\nwhom are expected to be found to be innocent. Investigators believe<br/>\nthere<br/>\ncould be hundreds of people linked to al-Qaeda living in the US, and the<br/>\n<br/>\nBush Administration has issued a warning that more attacks are probably<br/>\nbeing planned.<br/>\n<br/>\nNewsweek magazine reports today that Mohammed Atta, the suspected<br/>\nringleader who died in the first plane to hit the World Trade Center,<br/>\nhad<br/>\nbeen looking into hitting an aircraft carrier. Investigators retracing<br/>\nhis<br/>\nmovements found that he visited the huge US Navy base at Norfolk,<br/>\nVirginia, in February and April this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nCopyright 2001 Times Newspapers Ltd.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Julie Stauffer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jnjstau@...\">jnjstau@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 30, 2001 10:35 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1553<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;allow our government to run willy nilly over citizen&#39;s rights because of<br/>\n&gt; threats?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The &quot;supposed&quot; threats that are secret and vague are concerning to me.<br/>\n&gt; Seems like every time people start questioning the government, we get<br/>\nwarned<br/>\n&gt; of an impending threat somewhere, with something, from somebody.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, talks of government sanctioned assassinations and secret military<br/>\n&gt; tribunals instead of trials...Sweeping surveillance of citizens in case<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; might speak against the government...People losing jobs because of their<br/>\n&gt; speech and ideas....People being harrassed for not being &quot;American&quot; enough<br/>\n&gt; if they don&#39;t tow the party line.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does this sound like Nazi Germany to anyone else?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Julie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

I mourn for the country America could have been, once almost<br/>\nwas, now never will be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am hostile to law enforcement right now.  They are taking away my rights.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not afraid of bin Laden and I refuse to be intimidated by our<br/>\ngovernment.  Guess Ashcroft was right about one thing.....we should be on<br/>\nhigh alert.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome college students were protesting the war just this last weekend in NYC.<br/>\nTheir permit forced them to break up into small groups.....only to cover a<br/>\n10foot deep space separated from the other groups by the length of a block.<br/>\nThen NYC firetrucks were allowed to park next to them and blow their sirens.<br/>\nAnyone walking along the street who stopped to listen to the protest was<br/>\ntold by police to keep moving.  What happened to our right to assemble?  I<br/>\ngot this information straight from a student on another list who was present<br/>\nat the demonstration.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"DACunefare@aol.com","from":"DACunefare@...","profile":"undermom","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"AoEFCYT7AKNqPIHDZd5lkOowDF0XQU4N_jE5aeKyhu-PylQjsGvcqqzMyQwfUYg4-CVC791XpC__","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1553","postDate":"1004459186","msgId":27112,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJjLjFjMTg2NzM1LjI5MTAyZWIyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":27124,"prevInTime":27111,"nextInTime":27113,"topicId":27112,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**Should we have ignored the plea from the French? the Jews? the Vietnamese? the Kuwaities?
