It just<br/>\ndoes it automatically when someone joins. But here&#39;s the text:<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what<br/>\nthey need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent<br/>\nis a facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with<br/>\ncuriosity and enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what,<br/>\nwhen, where and how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to<br/>\nSpongebob Squarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to<br/>\nfind out more about how video games and life in general are filled with<br/>\nlearning, come join us!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling is<br/>\n*not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed<br/>\nlearning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest in<br/>\nunschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in<br/>\nmind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways<br/>\ndesigned to help each other become unschoolers or become better at<br/>\nunschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a<br/>\n&quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively<br/>\ndebate and questioning beliefs to their foundations.
