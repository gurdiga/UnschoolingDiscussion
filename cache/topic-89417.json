Tell me more about it.&quot;I<br/>\nasked him what he had found out and that he could share with me. That I was<br/>\nreally interested. Then I sat back and listened to him. Really listened. He<br/>\ntold me what he knew at the time. I told him he could share with me<br/>\nanything. (I had said that for years) He did a _great_ job explaining what<br/>\nhe knew. I think this was about 4-5 yrs ago when he was 13-14.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I was, and still am, very proud of myself too. You see I was raised in a<br/>\nstrict Baptist household. Church every sunday/ sunday night, dresses down to<br/>\nmy knees, no dancing, etc. Also the authoritarian parenting route. The whole<br/>\nnine yards. I could have gotten really upset and blew my stack but I didn&#39;t.<br/>\nI stayed calm and really listened. I hate to admit it but I/We have been<br/>\nvery controlling in the past and Michael got the brunt of that too. I&#39;m so<br/>\nthankful that has changed. :-) I may have even been here lurking. I&#39;ve<br/>\nsubbed and unsubbed a couple times. These lists have helped me a bunch.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Back to my son. He told me a few things and I could see the similarities<br/>\nto my beleifs. Which have changed a ton over the years too. It also changed<br/>\nour relationship for the better. I really beleive that up to that point he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t beleive I _really_ respected him and what he thought. He has since<br/>\nthen always told me the truth even when he knew I may disagree or be shocked<br/>\nby it. We&#39;ve had great conversation on just about everything now. Drugs,<br/>\nsex, friends, girls, and of course more on religion and Wicca. He now know I<br/>\nam truely interested and that is so wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Matter of fact he did more studying and used his knowledge of Wicca to<br/>\nwrite his exam paper in English last quarter. He&#39;s quite a young man but<br/>\nthen I&#39;m biased. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBarb E<br/>\nThe hardest battle is to be nobody but yourself<br/>\nin a world that is doing its best, night and day,<br/>\nto make you like everybody else.<br/>\n<br/>\nE.E.
