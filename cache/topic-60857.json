I have a two and a half year old who has a brand new sister (Nora is 3 months) and I have made up several Sadie and Nora songs for them. I always try to include Sadie in whatever aspect of caring for Nora that she wants to and I am always happily surprised at how much she does want to do. She loves to put powder on Nora&#39;s little butt while I change her and to remind me that Nora needs diapers but she doesn&#39;t anymore. Talk about a reminder that children will learn when they are ready: Sadie just decided one day a month ago that she had had it with diapers and was ready to move on. Two days later she was potty trained. All we did was push those well meaning grandparents away when they tried to pressure her about it and read a couple books about the subject and she knew when she was ready and now she is so proud to not be the &quot;baby&quot; like little Nora:) <br/>\nKelli<br/>\n Sorcha &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sorcha-aisling@...\">sorcha-aisling@...</a>&gt; wrote:Ok, my sons are both have spring birthdays and they&#39;re turning 2 and 5,<br/>\nso I&#39;m not pretending to have life-long answers, but they do get along<br/>\nextremely well, so I thought I&#39;d share some of the ways I handle their<br/>\ndisagreements.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I approach it as though they are both in the right and it&#39;s<br/>\nmerely the situation, and their conflicting goals, causing the problem.<br/>\nFor example, when the &quot;baby&quot; was a little younger he went through a<br/>\nperiod of knocking down block towers.

That&#39;s so nice of you to build a block tower for<br/>\nhim!&quot;  Now, some kids might look at me like I was an idiot, but my son<br/>\nactually looked at it from the point of view I was trying to show and<br/>\nstarting building towers and then saying, &quot;Come on, knock this one<br/>\ndown!&quot; and having great fun.  And then during his brother&#39;s naps I&#39;d<br/>\nremind him that it would be a perfect chance to build something that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get knocked down.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, if one of them hits the other, I say, &quot;Oops!  Your frustration got<br/>\nso big that you forgot not to hit your brother!&quot;  I acknowledge the<br/>\nfeelings of both parties and I emphasize the source of the conflict and<br/>\nhow we can solve it.  Now it&#39;s at the point where the 5 year old never<br/>\nhits his brother anymore, and the 2 year old sometimes still does, but<br/>\nhis brother doesn&#39;t retaliate, he just says, &quot;We don&#39;t hit people.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen my younger son was first born, I made up a song about how much I<br/>\nlove him and how much I love his brother.  I&#39;d sit holding the baby in<br/>\nthe same room his brother was playing in.  Even though the baby didn&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand the words (to him it was just a snuggle and a song), his<br/>\nbrother *did* understand the words and knew that even though I was<br/>\nspending so much time with the new baby, that they were both my boys and<br/>\nI love them both.  I&#39;ve always emphasized how wonderful it is for both<br/>\nof them to have a brother to play with and how much I love my own<br/>\nbrother (who&#39;s a Marine and stationed in the Persian Gulf right now; I&#39;m<br/>\nnot being phony when I say it&#39;s wonderful to be able to play with your<br/>\nbrother.  I really do wish my brother was still sitting in the living<br/>\nroom playing legos with me instead of sitting on a ship half-way around<br/>\nthe world).<br/>\n <br/>\nSorcha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] parenting books/questions","postDate":"1047569705","msgId":60982,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjYwMWMyZTk3NiQ1NGJiYzYwMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGYzLjI5OGI1NjhhLjJiYTEwNTRmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":60970,"nextInTopic":60985,"prevInTime":60981,"nextInTime":60983,"topicId":60857,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So many books...
