My son Joey is 7 and was pulled out of school in <br/>\nK. Before he went I bought a program called &quot;Front line phonics&quot; and <br/>\nhe absolutely HATED it.  So I returned it and thought I&#39;ll leave <br/>\nthis alone. I also thought maybe the schools would do something I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how to (now I know different). I sent him to school and <br/>\nthey suggested I put him into a thing they call Title one (special <br/>\nhelp) for him to learn his letters because he would forget them. I <br/>\nwould talk to the Title one teacher and she would say he is doing <br/>\nwonderful and he knows this, this and this letter. I would go home <br/>\nand ask him and he wouldn&#39;t know. I realized that he just remembered <br/>\nthem just to shut her up. I of course was devastated because I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know about unschooling at the time. Although I didn&#39;t know I <br/>\npulled him out because I couldn&#39;t bear the pain of watching him be <br/>\nso unhappy. I decided to give him a break (of course not right away <br/>\nlol......) and just read to him. Thankfully I found this group !!!!! <br/>\nI even let him have his video games he&#39;s always wanted and I find <br/>\nthat he knows a lot of big words and he can listen to very long <br/>\nstories and loves them !! He can understand and comprhend many <br/>\nthings that doesn&#39;t require reading. He has started asking me what <br/>\ncertain words say. I am totally relaxed now. I see he has the desire <br/>\nto learn in his OWN way and that is fine for me. I see HIS progress <br/>\nand have let go of my own ideas of how it should be mastered. He <br/>\nbegs me to read to him at night and hates me to point my finger <br/>\nLOL................ He use to feel ashamed that he couldn&#39;t read and <br/>\nI assured him that he is fine and will learn in his own way on his <br/>\nown time and he is fine now. He always proudly says I can&#39;t read <br/>\ntell me what that says - but I can see the wheels turning and I do <br/>\nsee that he understands small words but desn&#39;t think he is reading <br/>\nbecause he cannot pick up a book or a note like I can and fluently <br/>\nread. I have two stepsons who live with their mother who go to <br/>\npublic school. I can totally understand what you ment by the SOLID <br/>\nfoundation because they are not fluent but they are required to do a <br/>\nbook report - WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT ?????? Also my oldest who is 15 <br/>\nHATES to read and I feel badly.  Anyway, back to my little Joey he <br/>\nis also missing 4 teeth in the front and cannot pronounce certain <br/>\nwords and I think it is so cute !! They of course had him in speech <br/>\ntherapy. His fornt teeth peeking through(peeing LOl....) and I&#39;m <br/>\nexcitied and sad that my little boy is growong up reading and <br/>\nspeaking correctly now .......................................... <br/>\nsigh :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSonya<br/>\nAttleboro, Mass.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85540,"nextTopicId":85575}}
