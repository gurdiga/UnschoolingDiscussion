I have no support for homeschooling on my side of the family<br/>\n&gt; except my husband (whose idea it orginally was to hs)and my children<br/>\n&gt; who are totally all for it. I love having my children home with me<br/>\n&gt; all day long and enjoy being with them. I just started the<br/>\n&gt; unschooling approach about a month or two ago. I love it and so do<br/>\n&gt; the children! I would never send them back to ps again unless the<br/>\n&gt; children insisted that they wanted to go. But, I don&#39;t think that<br/>\n&gt; will happen anytime soon! Anyway my problem is my mom. She just<br/>\n&gt; totally opposes the idea of homeschooling especially unschooling. I<br/>\n&gt; tried to keep the whole unschooling idea in the closet, hidden from<br/>\n&gt; her so I wouldn&#39;t have to try to explain the idea behind it all. She<br/>\n&gt; is so narrow minded on the subject and argues that the kids &quot;will<br/>\n&gt; never learn beyond what I know or what&#39;s around them to know.&quot; I<br/>\n&gt; tried to tell her that children will learn in any area that interests<br/>\n&gt; them far beyond what I know or can tell them. That I have learned far<br/>\n&gt; beyond what she or any public school has taught me. That I went on to<br/>\n&gt; learn things in areas that interest me. I know I don&#39;t live my life<br/>\n&gt; or raise my children to make her happy but it bothers me when I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have her support. Does anyone know how I could handle this situation<br/>\n&gt; better? I get so upset and teary eyed everytime she puts me down for<br/>\n&gt; what I feel like is best for my children. Then I start wondering if<br/>\n&gt; they won&#39;t learn properly. Will they learn enough by unschooling. Can<br/>\n&gt; anyone reassure me of my decision to homeschool?<br/>\n&gt; Lisa, whose confused and upset at the moment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Avoid the lines and visit avis.com for quick and easy online<br/>\n&gt; reservations.

Let her know about <br/>\nlocal homeschooling events and conferences and playgroups and co-ops that are <br/>\navailable.  (We recently participated in a science/art fair.  Both sets of <br/>\ngrandparents came to see.)  If, after everything, she continues to put you <br/>\ndown, I think you have every right to calmly, yet firmly, state that she does <br/>\nnot have to agree with you, but she does have to accept your decision, and <br/>\nthat maybe it would be best to agree to disagree, and let it drop for awhile. <br/>\nI would also maintain that in no circumstance would it be acceptable to put <br/>\ndown homeschooling in front of your children.
