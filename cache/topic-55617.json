An allergic reaction to a food quite often means swelling, difficulty beathing,  rashesetc etc as soon as the substance is introduced. An<br/>\nintolarence can mean eczma, asthma, maybe a rash, behavioural problems not always instantly with the problem food.. All problems but not life threatening. A true allergy can be life threatening.<br/>\nMy kids develop ecxzma (I can never spell that) and did as babies because they are intolerant of dairy and eggs. It can be quite nasty - child number 2 was covered from the neck down on one occasion in<br/>\nitching weeping sores. Everytime he moved his skin cracked. It was pretty unpleasant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think its important people tell their kids friends which it is so that accidents don&#39;t happen. Ever since I moved to Virginia I&#39;ve found people going to see &#39;their&#39; allergist and going on about their<br/>\nallergies. So much so that I&#39;m afriad I&#39;ve stopped listening. Either Virginia is a super-allergic place - 3 out of every 4 people I&#39;ve met here seem to have allergies compared to 2 people back home (one<br/>\nwas allergic to horses, one a true allergy to eggs - anaphalctic shock etc) or generally they mean food intolerances.<br/>\nMind you, maybe there&#39;s something about Virginia. Like I said, back home I only knew two people with proper allergies, maybe a scattering with hay-fever (I get that myself) but here I know scads of<br/>\npeople allergic to cats, dogs, guinea-pigs, dust, pollen, mould etc etc. It&#39;s like an epidemic. Perhaps its the pollution here in North Virginia? The odd thing is, my husband has asthma and used to need<br/>\none of those inhalers. Since we moved to VA he&#39;s not had one asthma attack. Which is lucky. Cos we&#39;ve lost his inhaler.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m rambling again.<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: sugar bad or not? or the lies are parents told us.","postDate":"1043032439","msgId":55687,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyMC4xYzk4NjBhZi4yYjVjYzM3N0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55686,"nextInTopic":55702,"prevInTime":55686,"nextInTime":55688,"topicId":55617,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/19/2003 9:54:57 PM Eastern Standard Time, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: It s not a question of whether allergies actually exist.

My &quot;symptoms&quot; were excema patches inside the bends of my arms <br/>\n(nearly constant) and the backs of my legs (more rare).  That&#39;s it.  Nothing <br/>\nelse.  So I was deprived of chocolate for seven or eight years.  When I ate <br/>\nchocolate on the sly, there was no change whatsoever in the condition, but <br/>\nhad I reported that I would have been in trouble for being sneaky.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso they said nylon.  I still don&#39;t wear nylon much.  It bothers me.  I&#39;m <br/>\nalways aware of it.  I didn&#39;t mind wearing cotton underwear.  Nylon stockings <br/>\ndon&#39;t bother me.  But the nylon cloth material, like slips, that&#39;s a little <br/>\nirritating.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo my mom didn&#39;t lie, per se, she just jumped on a magic &quot;cure&quot; for something <br/>\nthat probably, in retrospect, had more to do with my needing more baths.  We <br/>\nrarely had a shower while I was growing up (for a year or so when I was five <br/>\nor six), and my mom &quot;made&quot; us take baths once a week.  Not enough.  There <br/>\nwere four girls, and we only ever had one bathroom.  When I was really little <br/>\nit was water poured into a #2 washtub.  We had a water heater, but not a <br/>\nfinished bathroom for many years.  Outhouse and washtub. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly is sensitive to bubble baths and fancy bath soaps.  I was too.  I used <br/>\nto use Ivory soap or bath oil.  NOT good for excema.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time my  mom gave the other kids chocolate and me something else, she <br/>\nshould&#39;ve given me chocolate and let me play in the bathtub for a while <br/>\nafterward.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What&#39;s done is done,&quot; but it doesn&#39;t need to be done with MY kids.  They <br/>\ntalk to me about what bothers them and doesn&#39;t, whether it&#39;s food or soap or <br/>\nclothing or whatever, and I listen to them.  I help them figure out from <br/>\ntrial and error whether something they believe is true IS true (if they want <br/>\nto figure it out--Marty has superstitions), and I remind them that something <br/>\nthey don&#39;t like now, they might like when they&#39;re older.  Holly has lately <br/>\ndiscovered mushrooms and avocado.   Instead of &quot;I don&#39;t like spinach&quot; <br/>\n(PERIOD) we encourage kids to say &quot;I don&#39;t like spinach yet.&quot;  or &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>\nlike it these days,&quot; or whatever.  To leave the door open for change.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a friend who was a known and admitted liar (although from time to time <br/>\nshe would deny that she ever lied, of course).  I kept her kids sometimes.  <br/>\nShe had told one of her kids he was allergic to milk.  He knew he wasn&#39;t, and <br/>\nso ignored her.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote, first:  When a child knows a mom is bullshitting and he starts to <br/>\nignore her, where does that end?<br/>\n<br/>\nShe told me plainly once that he wasn&#39;t allergic to it, but she TOLD people <br/>\nhe was, because she just didn&#39;t want him to have it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen once when she left him at my house she said, &quot;Dane&#39;s allergic to milk.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRight.  For years I let him eat what he wanted to and never had a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ignored her too.  Soon I ignored everything she said.  Soon I assumed what <br/>\nshe said was likely the opposite of the truth.  That was a shame.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome years later she moved to another state and asked me to write her a <br/>\nrecommendation for a job.  I asked her if she was more honest than she had <br/>\nbeen before, because I was unwilling to recommend her if she hadn&#39;t changed <br/>\nthat aspect of her behavior.
