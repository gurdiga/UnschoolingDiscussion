At the end of the year, <br/>\n&gt; you have to hand in a portfolio with samples of the student&#39;s work, <br/>\n&gt; along with a letter from a qualified evaluator stating that progress <br/>\n&gt; has been made.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not one who said it&#39;s no big deal.  And I did unschool in MA for 6 years <br/>\nbefore moving to TX 6 months ago.  TX is soooo easy.  But I did the paperwork <br/>\nin MA and it was inconvenient but doable.  I didn&#39;t do samples or testing <br/>\nthough.    <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were in PA, I would get an evaluator who understands unschooling.  Mary <br/>\nHood (author of The Relaxed Home School) knows and recommends one.  I could <br/>\nget you her name if you want.   If I couldn&#39;t get around the samples then I <br/>\nguess I&#39;d ask them to do a smaple in September and again in June.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also work at changing the laws but probably move out of PA first.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n«·.,¸¸,.·´¯`·.,¸¸,.·´¯`·.»§«(¨`v´¨).»§«·.,¸¸,.·´¯`·.,¸¸,.·´¯`·.»<br/>\n                                 ` v´<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of <br/>\ninstruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiousity of inquiry; <br/>\nfor this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need <br/>\nof freedom.&quot;<br/>\n-- Albert Einstein <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40648,"nextTopicId":40653}}
