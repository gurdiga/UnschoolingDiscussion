I will play with them and read to them, some of the time, but when I have something that needs to be done, than they have to amuse themselves.  That&#39;s just the way it is.  If I need to do the dishes or mop the kitchen floor or clean out the refridgerator or oven, I ask them to leave the kitchen until I am done.  Period.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, they can do the same thing if they are playing and do not want to be disturbed, they are free to close their door and be left alone as long as they like.  I expect them to extend the same courtesy to me, to a certain degree.  I can&#39;t be expected to be completely left alone, given their ages.  I have to keep an ear on them at all times at least.  But if I am doing something and they are gumming up the works, I will ask them to please find something else to do until I finish my job.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that said, there are things that they can &quot;help&quot; with.  When we vacum, my 2 year old loves to go and get his toy vacum and help out.  They REALLY love to help me water the plants in the garden, or do any digging and weeding, etc.  When Dad is working on one of our many remodeling projects, the kids get their toy tools and &quot;help&quot; him.  When we do laundry they like to help throw the clothes into the machines and help me sort socks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my jobs are done on a casual schedule, whenever the mood strikes me and the kids allow me the time.  Some are done at naptime (like maybe mopping) and some after they go to bed (like balancing the checkbook) but most are done around them as they buzz around like a couple of tornadoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they were not both walking well (2 year old took his time to learn that) it was nearly impossible to get any outside chores done, like running errands.  Now though, I can take them with me in our van and they hold my hand or ride in the carts and I am able to do a number of things.  We only do our grocery shopping once every two weeks and we both go, taking two carts, one for each toddler.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"czuniga145@aol.com","from":"czuniga145@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"vfaXwg0oG-QHrPiPJeiF6pyS7F1o6SI-Vxc1P4aiciZ9ZDlHGiCKGYK2NTisKGitCbKhtMdRThs5","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Getting things done","postDate":"962644324","msgId":10479,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQuNmY0MzU3OS4yNjkyMjM2NEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10478,"nextInTopic":10481,"prevInTime":10478,"nextInTime":10480,"topicId":10471,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/3/00 9:50:06 AM Pacific Daylight Time, Jaam1224@cs.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1435475940\">In a message dated 7/3/00 9:50:06 AM Pacific Daylight Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jaam1224@...\">Jaam1224@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Candice,<br/>\n Great idea!

If they want to help you with projects  (some kids find window<br/>\nwashing fun)  then you can console yourself with the idea of future<br/>\ncompetence.   Could be that the future reality is about as true as &quot;pie in<br/>\nthe sky when you die&quot;   but you might feel better for the moment.    On the<br/>\nother hand they might be just as interested in following their own projects.<br/>\nAnd yes,   5 year olds can definitely have their own projects.    You might<br/>\nwant to do a little research on the idea of &quot;benign neglect&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for a toddler,   providing a safe environment for them to explore with<br/>\nyou in &quot;earshot&quot;   doing your own tasks  may allow them to &quot;entertain&quot;<br/>\nthemselves.    I can also remember actually &quot;hiring&quot;  my then 6 year old to<br/>\n&quot;entertain&quot;  his toddler brother.    Sometimes the payment  involved a<br/>\npromise to be sure the 6 yo  later had time to himself without interference<br/>\nfrom toddler  &quot;helping&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou needn&#39;t feel your duty is to constantly entertain.   On the other hand<br/>\nyou might want to allow yourself to be entertained by them while they are<br/>\nyoung.  Time will come that  you are not their most important audience.<br/>\nGet it while you can!<br/>\n<br/>\nVicki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Dia Garland","from":"&quot;Dia Garland&quot; &lt;moocow@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"o9zDpTkCLpXe2sMrveqBZMN4N7cGQxfA46TjE5OceUCdcjOP4BxQIFdG_QU3PN3BehM2Z5McZ6Cc5uq2RBMJaUHtdJL6Vfw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Getting things done","postDate":"962637338","msgId":10473,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwN2UwMWJmZTUwMSQ4YmQ5ZDRhMCQxMjAxMDIwYUBwMz4=","referencesHeader":"PDZhLjQ1NWI2N2QuMjY5MWZmN2RAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":10471,"nextInTopic":10474,"prevInTime":10472,"nextInTime":10474,"topicId":10471,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When my kids were small as yours are I did a lot of things in small segments.

How do any of you get anything else done in the house <br/>\n with having the kids there all day?  I need to clean out the freezer, <br/>\nwashing <br/>\n the windows outside.... Do you just include your kids in these tasks (then <br/>\nit <br/>\n turns a 1 hour job into a 4 hour job) or what? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently stated an experiment which has worked well for me in this area. <br/>\nFirst of all, the kids 9yod and 20mod, as well as stepsons when they are <br/>\nhere, are involved in lots of tasks. For example, the 9yo does lots of chores <br/>\nindependently while the 20 mo helps unload the dishwasher. The 9yo is also <br/>\ngreat at distracting the baby so I can get other things done.<br/>\nMy experiment has been to limit actual housework to 2 hours in the morning <br/>\nand 1/2 hour in the evening. I only do emergency stuff in between, i.e. <br/>\nspilled food. It has worked well for me because part of this time can overlap <br/>\nwith my daughter&#39;s many projects and I can just lend an ear when she needs <br/>\nit. I only run errands when I&#39;m on my way somewhere else. We have swimming <br/>\nlessons at 9am so I leave at 8 and pick up dry cleaning and whatever else on <br/>\nthe way. <br/>\nThe best thing has been that housework no longer seems like a never ending <br/>\ncycle. I know that once I start, I get off in 2 hours. (I&#39;m thinking of <br/>\nreducing to 1.5 hrs in the a.m.) <br/>\n<br/>\ncandice<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nHold fast to dreams<br/>\nFor if dreams die<br/>\nLife is a broken-winged bird<br/>\nThat cannot fly.<br/>\n-Langston Hughes</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10430,"nextTopicId":10919}}
