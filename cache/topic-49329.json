Once there was a long <br/>\ndiscussion on the translation of one word, and the implications that <br/>\nfollowed. I believe it was the greek word &quot;diakanons&quot; (sp? sorry, too <br/>\nearly, doesn&#39;t look quite right) which some texts translate as deacon <br/>\nand others don&#39;t, and this all went to a discussion as to whether or not <br/>\nwomen being priests was supported in the bible. I find religious history <br/>\nand learning about different faiths fascinating. Right now I&#39;m reading a <br/>\nlot about the gnostics. good stuff. The recent discovery of what may be <br/>\nthe ossary (burial box) of James, brother of Jesus, is also interesting. <br/>\nSort of real life Indiana Jones stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Friday, November 8, 2002, at 02:19  AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 11/7/02 10:15:07 PM Central Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; My point is, imho, to assert that &quot;The Bible&quot; is the unerring &quot;Word <br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; God&quot; (as some do) -- well, which version?
