Until a kid is about seven, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; parenting, anyway, it&#39;s not even un-anything.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I mean the following question seriously, and I&#39;m not being nasty.  But<br/>\n&gt; what&#39;s so special about seven?  Why 7?  Why not 9 or 5 or 14?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>C&#39;mon, I said &quot;about seven.&quot;  I agree.  Why any age, really. I agree that<br/>\nunschooling begins as parents prepare to have a child, and continues for<br/>\nlife. Unschooling is another way, perhaps, of saying &quot;self-governing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;About seven&quot; is when most children&#39;s cognitive senses are fairly well<br/>\ncoordinated with their physical abilities. I took a course in child<br/>\ndevelopment in which it was told that many children simply are not able to<br/>\ncoordinate their eyes with their hands and their brains until they are about<br/>\n8.  Before that age, for instance, they might actually &quot;write&quot; by drawing in<br/>\nsmall circular motions in one spot on a page because they have no concept of<br/>\nwhat writing is for yet, but see it only as making marks on paper, and have<br/>\nno real sense about reading yet, either. (Nature does not program those<br/>\nskills into them, they need to be learned, or acquired through their<br/>\nintellect)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lesson was that many children are simply not physically capable of doing<br/>\n&quot;schoolwork&quot; until their bodies catch up with their minds. The obvious<br/>\nquestion comes to mind then is, Why do we put them in schools (now at 3 or 4<br/>\n! !) and force them to do what many are physically incapable of doing, and,<br/>\nincidentally but equally important, what most have no interest in or need<br/>\nfor? The answer is that those activities provide jobs for adults, and<br/>\nbaby-sitting for working parents. Evidence points to NO benefits for the<br/>\nkids. Kids still need, at those early stages, to explore the world on their<br/>\nown terms as much as possible. That means free play and interaction with as<br/>\nlittle interference as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot long ago, this state (CT) considered school-age to be 6 - 17. I suppose<br/>\nthe reason was that most people used to believe that children did not need<br/>\nschooling until they were physically and emotionally ready to do school<br/>\nstuff. That has changed, unfortunately for many kids, because the kids have<br/>\nnot. Early schooling can damage them in two ways: it puts them in an<br/>\nunnatural setting doing unnatural things, and it deprives them of what they<br/>\ntruly need in order to develop well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids get to be about seven, they often find their own reasons to read,<br/>\nwrite, and cipher. Those things help them get a life of their own -- some<br/>\nindependence -- they understand that those concepts are tools they can use,<br/>\nand they are excited by what they can do with them. Conversely, if they<br/>\ndon&#39;t acquire those skills, their parents become anxious, and start fretting<br/>\nand cajoling, even teaching.  It takes an unusually relaxed parent (a<br/>\nsupremely confident unschooler) to simply wait until a child shows an<br/>\ninterest in reading and calculating, especially after the child reaches<br/>\n&quot;school-age&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n I agree with you, Brenda, that there is no certain age that should<br/>\ndetermine anything when it comes to child development. Age-grading is what<br/>\nschools do entirely for the convenience and purposes of the school -- they<br/>\nare cutting cookies, not educating individuals. Parents need simply to be<br/>\nwatchful, engaged - but not to an extreme, available to help in the way it<br/>\nis requested - but not hovering, and with lots of assurances for the child<br/>\nthat s/he is OK exactly the way s/he is.  Disney&#39;s key is providing exactly<br/>\nthat for  people -- REASSURANCE.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\nPS Brenda wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;But Ned, we ARE free. . . .
