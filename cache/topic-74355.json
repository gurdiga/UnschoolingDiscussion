Now as an adult, I can see how thoughtless it is for someone (say a<br/>\nbride) to overlook any money and time spent in chosing a gift by not<br/>\nresponding with a card. In cases of gifts sent long-distance, a card let&#39;s<br/>\nthe sender know that the gift was received. How do we teach our kids to show<br/>\nappreciation for gifts without forcing Thank You cards?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI send thank you&#39;s for gifts. Always have. My mom always did and I guess I<br/>\ngot it from her. But not for everything. If its&#39; my birthday or my<br/>\nchildren&#39;s birthday and someone comes with a gift (same with Christmas) I<br/>\nwill verballythank them for the gift and for spending time with us. If it<br/>\nseems over the top with what they did as far as the gift, I will also send a<br/>\nnote later. If it&#39;s a wedding, anniversary graduation thing that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhappen every year, I will send a thank you. If anyone sends anything that<br/>\nwasn&#39;t there to present it, I send a thank you. I&#39;ve followed this way of<br/>\ndoing it with my kids too. So they see me do it. When they got older I would<br/>\nlet them know what I was doing on behalf of them. Sometimes even asking if<br/>\nthey wanted to sign it. When Tara got older I would get the card and ask her<br/>\nif she wanted to write something in it or just sign it. Now she sends her<br/>\nown when the circumstances come up. I guess again by modeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Manners, rank","postDate":"1055799125","msgId":74450,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmIwMWMzMzQ0ZSRiYmIwNjk2MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDdiLjEzNmViMjg3LjJjMWY2ZmE3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":74448,"nextInTopic":74451,"prevInTime":74449,"nextInTime":74451,"topicId":74355,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From:  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-679299172\">From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RJHill241@...\">RJHill241@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;The initial part of the thread was about manners, then rank became a part<br/>\nof<br/>\nthe topic, where introductions are supposed to be done based on ones rank.
