It was easy to think of each person on the way by.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It matters to me, greatly, that my family is happy, and it matters to them <br/>\nthat I am. We all do little things for one another along with the big things. If <br/>\nsomeone gets up for a drink when we&#39;re all watching tv, they ask if the <br/>\nothers want something. When Beth orders groceries, she buys tubes of cookie dough <br/>\nwe can have fresh baked cookies whenever we want. (I said we&#39;re thoughtful, not <br/>\nthat we aren&#39;t lazy.)  If I&#39;m working at my desk, Julian will come behind me <br/>\nand give me a shoulder massage.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone noticed once when Juls and I were in a store and I asked him if there <br/>\nwas anything he wanted or needed before we left. They said, &quot;Oh, are you in <br/>\nfor it!&quot;  Juls said, &quot;She always asks me.&quot;  The thing is, he knows that if I <br/>\ncan reasonably afford it (and if I can&#39;t, he can usually have it eventually, <br/>\njust not now), he can have whatever he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe almost always says no. I have seen kids in museum gift shops clamoring for <br/>\nthings. Julian never does. He can have what he wants or needs, so he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nneed the validation of something just because. Far from being &quot;spoiled&quot; (and <br/>\ndon&#39;t you HATE that term!), Julian is not greedy. <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, it&#39;s really important that my family be happy as much as it can. Makes <br/>\nme happy too.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75928,"nextTopicId":75955}}
