I wish <br/>\nI had some now!&quot;). It seems to make him feel better than if I try to change <br/>\nhis mind about being unhappy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he objects to something in a very loud and whiny way, I tell him right <br/>\naway that he can cry as hard as he wants and it&#39;s not going to change my <br/>\nmind. (Screaming for candy in the store is one example.) I actually urge <br/>\nhim, very sincerely, to scream and howl as loudly as he can. (Louder! <br/>\nLouder!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat really seems to take the wind out of his sails for tantrums. It works <br/>\nfor my little guy ... maybe it will help someone else too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as not behaving civilly at home...I think we&#39;re pretty tolerant, but <br/>\nif he completely disrupts dinner, or Tony and I can&#39;t read a book because <br/>\nNicky is yelling that he wants to read something else, I take him by the <br/>\nhand and lead him to his room. I tell him he can rejoin us when he can be <br/>\nquiet or stop spitting or stop throwing food or whatever (aren&#39;t toddlers <br/>\ndelightful? Well, yes, they can be....). That seems to leave the decision to <br/>\nreturn in his control.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10811,"nextTopicId":10857}}
