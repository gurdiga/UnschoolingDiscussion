Inside said shoe box are <br/>\ncondoms, all varieties, all kinds and even sizes (Internet site that you buy <br/>\nthem buy the dozens for good prices).  I have not looked inside that box in the <br/>\nsix years since I put it there.  I have taken the lid off and thrown more <br/>\ninside.  Sometimes finding it too full to add.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also know that other teens who are 19, 20 and sometimes even older visit <br/>\nthe linen closet before heading back to college.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children do NOT regal me with tales of the sexual escapades but I do know <br/>\nwho they&#39;ve had sex with and who they&#39;ve made love with and it&#39;s not because <br/>\nI&#39;ve asked, they&#39;ve felt like sharing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes they will come and say they&#39;ve made a mistake by taking a <br/>\nrelationship to that level, I think it shows maturity to be able to say that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest boy was sick for a week once at age 16, didn&#39;t want to see his <br/>\ngirlfriend.  I thought it must be a sickness of the heart.  Finally he confided to <br/>\nme that he had &quot;done the deed&quot; and was just sick about it and worried what I <br/>\nwould think about it. (in regard to it being that particular girl) We talked <br/>\nfor a long time, he felt better, much better.  He&#39;s 22 now, he&#39;s still with the <br/>\nsame girl, they live together not far from here, I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s having <br/>\nsex outside of marriage.  I&#39;ve talked to him about why NOT marry the girl.  <br/>\nMakes sense to me if you&#39;ve been with someone since before your 15th birthday <br/>\nand you are now 22 and you&#39;ve lived together since you were 18 that marriage <br/>\nmight be on the horizon or at least an engagement. But apparently not.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nlove him any less, there are no repercussions, it&#39;s just life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with my older girl.  I could have said if you have sex before marriage I <br/>\nam not sending you to college, but WHY would you?  So they either don&#39;t or <br/>\nsay they haven&#39;t had sex, go off to college where there is no way in the world <br/>\nthat you can keep those same ground rules for your child and it just opens up <br/>\nthe avenue to a deceitful relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I have discussed at length loving, committed relationships <br/>\nwith my children.  I have discussed disease and pregnancy.  I have discussed <br/>\nemotional ramifications that are often associated with being sexual with <br/>\nsomeone.  I have discussed that fornication is fornication, whether I have a <br/>\npunishment for it or not, whether I see it as right or wrong or not.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nnecessarily think that my beliefs are their beliefs nor expect that they would follow <br/>\nall of mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m Baptist, one child grew up to want to be Catholic, so she went through <br/>\nall the classes and is now a practicing Catholic, not because of a spouse who <br/>\nwanted her to convert or having children who &quot;must&quot; be raised in the faith, but <br/>\nbecause she chose to embrace that particular religion.  Of course a lot of <br/>\nGOOD Baptists would be glad to tell you that Catholics are going to hell... <br/>\napparently I am NOT a good Baptist.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne son wanted to be Jewish in the worst way when he was around the seven to <br/>\nnine year old age. (MANY nights of presents appealed to him more than waiting <br/>\nthe ONE night for Santa) We did lots of research on it, we explored Jewish <br/>\ncustoms and participated with Jewish families, not just at Hanukkah time.  He <br/>\nliked the feeling of being special, different I think.  It passed after a while. <br/>\nHe met a really extreme Jewish family who lobbied the school to have no <br/>\ninstance of &quot;Christmas&quot; in the building.  No decorating with snowmen, no Santa&#39;s in <br/>\nsight, no candy canes even.  He wrongly judged Jewish people on one family <br/>\nthat was very fanatical and I think it was more about causing a fuss than their <br/>\nreligion.  He no longer wanted to be Jewish anymore.  So he&#39;s not, not really <br/>\nanything.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DH&#39;s family thinks it HIGHLY extreme that I ALLOW my 23 year old daughter <br/>\nto convert and be a practicing Catholic.  They think it&#39;s wrong that I serve <br/>\nwine with dinner, they think a lot of things are extreme and wrong.  Some <br/>\npeople are like that, whatever it is that THEY don&#39;t approve of, it&#39;s extreme <br/>\nbehaviour if you do it or &quot;allow&quot; your kids to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan we ever really &quot;allow&quot; our kids to do things?  I know I&#39;ve said, I&#39;d <br/>\nrather they NOT do things, but that doesn&#39;t carry any threat of punishment or <br/>\nconsequences from me if they choose to go ahead with whatever activity is being <br/>\ndiscussed.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would one stop one&#39;s child from doing something they didn&#39;t approve of?  <br/>\nDo you just tell them so they stop it?  Do you hit them so they stop it?  Do <br/>\nyou ground them so you can watch every move?  Do you never let them out of your <br/>\nsight to do anything outside the home?  Do you call the police?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does it look like to stop a child from doing something they want to do <br/>\nbut you do not want them to?  I can understand the mutual respect that would <br/>\ncause a child or parent to not do something, but I don&#39;t know how it would look <br/>\nto stop a child that truly wanted to do something.
