But it&#39;s impossible.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe tried to leave but there is no way out of Houston.  There is no gas and no space on the highways.  People&#39;s cars are dying on the road from overheating (it&#39;s almost 100 degrees) or lack of gas and they&#39;re not moving anywhere anyway.

Even when opening the contraflow lanes, it takes only 5 minutes for them to become so packed they&#39;re at a stand still.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m afraid the national media will make it look like a very organized effort with the government completely in charge.  That&#39;s because they, the officials, think they are.  They aren&#39;t out here with the rest of us, standing in line for the last of necessities, worried sick because *we can&#39;t leave*!.  Eventually, they&#39;ll take their helicopter rides at the tax payer&#39;s expense to safety and we&#39;ll still be here scared to death.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe stayed this long because my dh was busy working for the state making sure abused children were evacuated.  Little did we know we would be stuck and the city would refuse to open shelters in sturdier buildings.  I&#39;m sure they will eventually but most of the city&#39;s poor are not in the madatory evac areas and therefore don&#39;t qualify for free transportation out.  Most of the city is not under madatory evacuation and buses will stop running soon.  There will be no way for people to get to the shelters.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, I guess we&#39;re staying put.
