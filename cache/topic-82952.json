Direct ALL rage to the advertisers - they are paying CBS to piss off viewers.  If you petition CBS or mail this rant, I guarantee they will smile and point at their rights under the constitution and stick it to the next unsuspecting group - or worse do a &quot;follow-up&quot; piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn acquaintance in the Canadian CBC-TV (heralded as even handed and balanced by many) told me, when they got a tip that a certain elementary school principal was sexually inappropriate, her editor sent her & a crew to get the story.  There was none.  Zilch. But she saw a good news piece and shot that instead.  Editor nearly fired her.  &quot;Make it up if you.  Bend the truth into &quot;news&quot; even if you destroy an innocent principal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, with CBC, their program Marketplace (uncovers scams etc.) destroyed an old employee&#39;s home construction business.  Burned him with selective editing of tape of the lady who was mad at him and his own footage too.  She later apologized that he lost his business over a window that would not seal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if we boycott Kraft Dinner or Nike or  (dare I suggest here!!!!) Maxi-pads, we might get somewhere. &quot;Kraft Dinner sponsors Hate.&quot;  Sensational.  Wonder if CBS would do a story on that!!!???

Where can I send it, do you <br/>\n    know?<br/>\n<br/>\n    Betsy<br/>\n<br/>\n    *********************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n    I am deeply offended by the biased and bigoted piece CBS Eye on America <br/>\n    ran on Tuesday implying that homeschooling parents are likely to abuse <br/>\n    their children and should be supervised.  (Homescholing Nightmares) <br/>\n    Stirring up fear and suspicion of people who are different is an easy <br/>\n    way to rouse a mob.  That&#39;s a power the media should use cautiously. <br/>\n    Stigmatizing and distrusting an entire group based on a few sensational <br/>\n    acts is cheap and unfair.  I expected better from CBS.<br/>\n<br/>\n    You may be surprised at the outcry from homeschoolers, but if you had <br/>\n    run such a piece about any ethnic group or about the crimes of <br/>\n    left-handed redheads, the redheaded anti-defamation league would be all <br/>\n    over you, and rightly so.  Be responsible journalists and use meaningful <br/>\n    statistics; don&#39;t make up trends from blips.<br/>\n<br/>\n    The notion that putting children in classrooms could eliminate abuse is <br/>\n    simplistic and wrong.  If you sincerely wish to save children from abuse <br/>\n    then devote more air time to the serious issues of mental illness, <br/>\n    poverty and substance abuse.  These are the strongest factors leading to <br/>\n    child abuse and neglect in this country.  Let&#39;s put our efforts into <br/>\n    fixing what we know is broken.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Government supervision is expensive, intrusive and not very effective. <br/>\n    Do you think television journalism would be improved if journalists were <br/>\n    required to register with the government and subjected to periodic <br/>\n    government inspection?  I don&#39;t.  But I do think your editorial policies <br/>\n    are too weak and should be improved.  Your pieces on &quot;The Dark Side of <br/>\n    Homeschooling&quot; have been shoddy, sensationaistic, and shallow.  I can&#39;t <br/>\n    respect a news organization that airs this kind of thoughtless, <br/>\n    worthless garbage.  I will avoid all of your news shows in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Elizabeth Hill<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Yahoo!
