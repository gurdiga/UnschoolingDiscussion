I<br/>\nnotice that my children are extremely happy when I step out of their way,<br/>\nand they keep extremely busy and are constantly learning. That doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\nthat I am not involved in what they are learning, because we do have lots of<br/>\nthings around that they may need help with, and quite often they want help,<br/>\na suggestion, or want to work together on something.<br/>\nAlso, I really believe in what I wrote above, but I must confess that<br/>\noccasionally I get a little uptight with my older child, and question myself<br/>\nabout what we are doing, but it is just fear, concern whatever, but so far,<br/>\nI&#39;ve snapped out of it, and I remember that I have total confidence in her.<br/>\nAlso, sometimes I step back into teacher mode (I have a degree in<br/>\neducation), but my kids usually lose interested immediately when I act up,<br/>\nand I usually end up doing whatever I decided to teach them myself.<br/>\nWendy<br/>\nWendy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Dawn Falbe","from":"&quot;Dawn Falbe&quot; &lt;NumoAstro@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"SLrPn3CDZDOjxMLICkv4MYjcMbnFxV6YBVcAqQwAnn9EhCsUuekgSbh8jCQXYa0nswqdxkx_Alfr7PZGyb7_uZDK7lgRUug","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Waldorf","postDate":"968019694","msgId":12541,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhvdWl0ZStzajNpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhlLmExNDYzNDQuMjZlM2RhNDlAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12530,"nextInTopic":25006,"prevInTime":12540,"nextInTime":12542,"topicId":5967,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... starting ... pretty ... kids in ... ends.

It was a feeling difficult to describe--incredibly compelling.  Our oldest daughter attended a Waldorf school through the 7th grade (skipping 6th to try homeschooling) and the youngest through the 2nd grade.  Our school had a lot of political stuff going on (as all organizations do), but as soon as the door on the classroom closed, all that was separate from the children. The teachers/administrators, etc., almost without exception, had tremendous respect and love for the children.  It was unbelievable how much TIME they all took from their own lives--I think the school just became their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kindergarten, though, was the best experience. It was somewhat like living in a fairy tale or at least living in an atmosphere that corresponded with the feelings of a very young child. Both my children--especially the oldest, who had more time there, appreciate that they were able to experience it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy &quot;best of all worlds&quot; wish, though, would have been to have had the kindergarten experience followed by a few hours of the week at the school with the same people (a class, working on a play, doing some handwork...).
