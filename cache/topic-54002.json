We worked it <br/>\nout over the years by trying different things.  Attitudes and expectations <br/>\nhad to change (mine, too).  Ideas had to be expounded upon.  Relationships <br/>\nneeded to be nurtured.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd readiness needed to be achieved.  Naturally, little babies aren&#39;t going <br/>\nto be able to help with housework, and I did it all for them, then.  I was <br/>\nsingle when my two eldest were little and did most of it myself then, too.  <br/>\nBut, they *had* to go with me when I did laundry at the laundrymat.  There <br/>\nwas no other way.  It was just easier to enlist their help and get them into <br/>\nthe idea rather than struggle with divergent interests.  Some days were <br/>\nbetter than others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI happen to have natural leadership skills, and that&#39;s part of it, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 9 yo is living the life of Riley compared to my older kids&#39;.  (That&#39;s what <br/>\nmy adult kids will tell you, anyway. &lt;g&gt;)  I had money when he was little, so <br/>\nI even had a service come in once a week and clean. (That was only for a <br/>\nyear.)  But to me, it&#39;s like learning to read.  He lives in a literate house, <br/>\nwhere books and letters and numbers are all around him.  It&#39;s a daily <br/>\noccurrence to read and be read to, and he has had a sense from an early age <br/>\nthat reading is interesting and important and something simply to be done.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe lives in a house where cleaning is the same.  A good deal of time is spent <br/>\ndoing it.  There are good reasons for doing it and sometimes it&#39;s even <br/>\ninteresting.  It&#39;s simply something to be done.  It makes life easier.  If no <br/>\none has mowed the path around the lake, he might step on a snake when he goes <br/>\nfishing.  If he wants to stir his chocolate milk, he&#39;d like to have a clean <br/>\nspoon.  Actions lead to consequences.  It&#39;s part of that principle.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleaning and living in a clean house is just something I encouraged like <br/>\nanything else.  I tried not to get too upset about it (except when I was <br/>\nexpected to do it ALL when there were other perfectly capable people--dh--who <br/>\nshould do what they could).  I give myself permission to do only what I&#39;m <br/>\ncapable of, as well.  I&#39;d like to have all the dust off the furniture, but <br/>\nI&#39;m incapable of doing that and doing everything else I want to do as well.  <br/>\nI suppose it&#39;s a constant negotiation and realignment of priorities and <br/>\ninteracting with your family on the subject.  It&#39;s no different than anything <br/>\nelse, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":56051484,"authorName":"grlynbl@aol.com","from":"grlynbl@...","profile":"jaeschool","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] More about family life (Tuck)","postDate":"1042121614","msgId":54002,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEzLjM2ZjdhZmRjLjJiNGVkZDhlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":54011,"prevInTime":54001,"nextInTime":54003,"topicId":54002,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Tuck, Whew, thanks for saying all of that..
