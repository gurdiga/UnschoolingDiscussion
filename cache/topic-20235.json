Am I the only one that slept around here??  <br/>\n<br/>\nHello to all the new folks on the list.  I&#39;ve been going rather fast through a kabillion (that&#39;s a new number we came up with along with forty hundred thousand) e-mails.  I&#39;ve read every one but they have blurred.  So, hello and welcome aboard...<br/>\n<br/>\nValerie - Book cover:  &quot;NOT Another Brick in the Wall&quot;  That was Floyd, wasn&#39;t it?  The picture is a red brick wall with a double photo of a mass of faces, one brick is vertical with a picture of your daughter.  It would appeal to everyone&#39;s desire for individuality.  Something that so many are lacking, especially children in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberta, Canada - Hi Dee Ho.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeanmarie - We met a phsyc a few weeks ago that said homeschoolers are deprived a wider variety and quantity of life experiences that schooled children have, to help them in real life.  Of course, my husband and I really wanted to ask how &quot;kiddie prison&quot;  can provide &quot;life experiences&quot;  to anyone but the lab rats!!!!!!  We were nice and, like with most, left her to her fenced-in world. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve only been here a few weeks and LOVE IT!!  I know unschooling is the way for us but it helps to have others to talk to or just listen to sometimes.  I&#39;ve read a lot of books about home/unschooling and get Growing Without Schooling magazine, but this better than any book (not that I won&#39;t love to read your book Valerie).<br/>\n<br/>\nAmbersand - aka Kandi, gifted by Kyle and Corey, the splashes of color in my black and white world.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20459,"nextTopicId":20207}}
