Stepheny<br/>\n<br/>\n  Here is some of what Phyllis Schlafly has to say about homeschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2002/june02/02-06-05.shtml\">http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2002/june02/02-06-05.shtml</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  It takes uncommon commitment by parents to undertake a homeschool  <br/>\n  regimen, but they soon discover they can do in a couple of hours what  <br/>\n  takes all day at regular school.  Homeschooling parents can save lots  <br/>\n  of time since there are so many courses they don&#39;t have to teach.<br/>\n<br/>\n  They don&#39;t have to teach multiculturalism, the peculiar notion that  <br/>\n  other cultures should be preferred to our own, or teach a course in  <br/>\n  Islam, such as is now taught in California schools.  Homeschooling  <br/>\n  parents are free to teach that their religion and their country are the  <br/>\n  best.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Homeschooling parents do not have to teach political correctness, such  <br/>\n  as the dogma that all academic subjects must be taught through the  <br/>\n  prism of gender and race oppression.  They are free to teach that  <br/>\n  America is not a land of victims but a country of freedom and  <br/>\n  opportunity for all.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Homeschooing parents do not have to teach the androgyny demanded by  <br/>\n  radical feminism.  They are free to teach boys and girls separately and  <br/>\n  differently and let their boys enjoy plenty of recess to work off their  <br/>\n  excess energy and avoid giving them Ritalin to make them behave like  <br/>\n  girls.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Homeschoolers do not have to take a course every year in Diversity, the  <br/>\n  code word for gay rights, as is now mandated K-12 by the California  <br/>\n  State Legislature.  Parent educators are free to teach that it is OK to  <br/>\n  be judgmental about illegal and immoral acts.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Homeschooling parents don&#39;t have to teach revisionist history that  <br/>\n  deletes mention of Washington, Jefferson and Franklin, as the New  <br/>\n  Jersey State Department of Education tried to do, but had to back down  <br/>\n  after a parental uproar.  Homeschoolers have academic freedom to study  <br/>\n  the Founding Fathers and read the writings of the DWEMs (Dead White  <br/>\n  European Males) who contributed so much to Western Civilization.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Homeschoolers do not have to study global education that is designed to  <br/>\n  promote global interdependence and citizens of the world instead of the  <br/>\n  U.S.A.  Homeschooling parents do not have to teach Environmental  <br/>\n  Education fantasies such as that humans exist to serve the earth  <br/>\n  instead of vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Homeschoolers don&#39;t have to study fuzzy math, whole math, new math, new  <br/>\n  new math, or rainforest math.  They won&#39;t waste math time discussing,  <br/>\n  coloring, playing games, or telling their parents how good they feel  <br/>\n  about incorrect answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Homeschooled children will learn to read using authentic phonics as  <br/>\n  their first order of business, so they won&#39;t have to take remedial  <br/>\n  reading after three years of failure.  They won&#39;t be inflicted with  <br/>\n  Whole Language, which fraudulently teaches children to guess at words  <br/>\n  from the pictures, skip over difficult words, and substitute any words  <br/>\n  that seem to fit the context.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Homeschoolers will save lots of time because they don&#39;t have to read  <br/>\n  typical middle school assignments of depressing modern fiction by  <br/>\n  &quot;nobody&quot; authors writing about drugs, violence, sex, runaway teens,  <br/>\n  witchcraft, and other depressing subjects.  Homeschoolers can read  <br/>\n  books about heroes and stories that build character, courage,  <br/>\n  patriotism, and virtue.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Homeschoolers won&#39;t have to spend time filling out nosy questionnaires  <br/>\n  about sex, drugs and suicide.  The public schools are obsessed with  <br/>\n  asking students impudent personal questions such as how many times have  <br/>\n  you felt depressed and tried to commit suicide.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There are many more worthless courses taught in public schools on which  <br/>\n  homeschoolers will not spend their precious time, such as courses in  <br/>\n  murder (forensics is the latest fad), suicide, death and dying,  <br/>\n  evolution, and self-esteem.  Homeschooled students won&#39;t have any  <br/>\n  problem with self-esteem because their self-esteem will be earned by  <br/>\n  achievement in mastering the important truths of history, literature,  <br/>\n  math and science.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   On Monday, October 27, 2003, at 09:51  AM, Tia Leschke wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; Tia, Why is that?

Homeschooling parents can save lots  <br/>\nof time since there are so many courses they don&#39;t have to teach.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t have to teach multiculturalism, the peculiar notion that  <br/>\nother cultures should be preferred to our own, or teach a course in  <br/>\nIslam, such as is now taught in California schools.  Homeschooling  <br/>\nparents are free to teach that their religion and their country are the  <br/>\nbest.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling parents do not have to teach political correctness, such  <br/>\nas the dogma that all academic subjects must be taught through the  <br/>\nprism of gender and race oppression.  They are free to teach that  <br/>\nAmerica is not a land of victims but a country of freedom and  <br/>\nopportunity for all.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooing parents do not have to teach the androgyny demanded by  <br/>\nradical feminism.  They are free to teach boys and girls separately and  <br/>\ndifferently and let their boys enjoy plenty of recess to work off their  <br/>\nexcess energy and avoid giving them Ritalin to make them behave like  <br/>\ngirls.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschoolers do not have to take a course every year in Diversity, the  <br/>\ncode word for gay rights, as is now mandated K-12 by the California  <br/>\nState Legislature.  Parent educators are free to teach that it is OK to  <br/>\nbe judgmental about illegal and immoral acts.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling parents don&#39;t have to teach revisionist history that  <br/>\ndeletes mention of Washington, Jefferson and Franklin, as the New  <br/>\nJersey State Department of Education tried to do, but had to back down  <br/>\nafter a parental uproar.  Homeschoolers have academic freedom to study  <br/>\nthe Founding Fathers and read the writings of the DWEMs (Dead White  <br/>\nEuropean Males) who contributed so much to Western Civilization.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschoolers do not have to study global education that is designed to  <br/>\npromote global interdependence and citizens of the world instead of the  <br/>\nU.S.A.  Homeschooling parents do not have to teach Environmental  <br/>\nEducation fantasies such as that humans exist to serve the earth  <br/>\ninstead of vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschoolers don&#39;t have to study fuzzy math, whole math, new math, new  <br/>\nnew math, or rainforest math.  They won&#39;t waste math time discussing,  <br/>\ncoloring, playing games, or telling their parents how good they feel  <br/>\nabout incorrect answers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooled children will learn to read using authentic phonics as  <br/>\ntheir first order of business, so they won&#39;t have to take remedial  <br/>\nreading after three years of failure.  They won&#39;t be inflicted with  <br/>\nWhole Language, which fraudulently teaches children to guess at words  <br/>\nfrom the pictures, skip over difficult words, and substitute any words  <br/>\nthat seem to fit the context.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschoolers will save lots of time because they don&#39;t have to read  <br/>\ntypical middle school assignments of depressing modern fiction by  <br/>\n&quot;nobody&quot; authors writing about drugs, violence, sex, runaway teens,  <br/>\nwitchcraft, and other depressing subjects.  Homeschoolers can read  <br/>\nbooks about heroes and stories that build character, courage,  <br/>\npatriotism, and virtue.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschoolers won&#39;t have to spend time filling out nosy questionnaires  <br/>\nabout sex, drugs and suicide.  The public schools are obsessed with  <br/>\nasking students impudent personal questions such as how many times have  <br/>\nyou felt depressed and tried to commit suicide.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many more worthless courses taught in public schools on which  <br/>\nhomeschoolers will not spend their precious time, such as courses in  <br/>\nmurder (forensics is the latest fad), suicide, death and dying,  <br/>\nevolution, and self-esteem.  Homeschooled students won&#39;t have any  <br/>\nproblem with self-esteem because their self-esteem will be earned by  <br/>\nachievement in mastering the important truths of history, literature,  <br/>\nmath and science.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Monday, October 27, 2003, at 09:51  AM, Tia Leschke wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Tia, Why is that?

There are no promises like that.  I know that homeschooling is good and love being with the kids, I know that public school just shuffles them along, but I can say that for the past couple of years we have been just floating along.. because all of a sudden my &quot;obedient son&quot; became rebellious and started straying all over the place.  We do have a good relationship now, although he nudges me to do phonics or math with the other kids now. LOL, I told him he unschooled himself through high school and it worked for him.  I showed him all that he taught himself and his interests.  Whenever he comes up with a good idea he shares it and I tell him &quot; that sounds good and doable&quot; ...  I digress...
