It not that we have power struggles. Our relationship ,<br/>\nI think, is rather good. I just wish he would talk to *me* more. I just<br/>\ncould be being selfish. He&#39;ll be 18 this Sept. He&#39;ll be moving out before I<br/>\nknow it. :-( I&#39;ll miss him being here daily.<br/>\n    I wish I could find my copy of Teen/ Parent Breakthrough.
