It&#39;s not about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW....when things fall in our home, which ever one is there yells &quot;I&#39;m okay!!&quot; Sadly, I&#39;m the awkward one. I have more bruises than Brianna! I Loading the van, setting up tents, carrying, schlepping....yes, I get bruised..and then I&#39;ll shout &quot;I&#39;m alive!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes - the wonderful sounds of the absence of fear!<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing like it!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrianna does get frightened. If she starts thinking of me dying. If she thinks she&#39;s dis-pleased me. We talk about it, still, she has these fears.<br/>\nShe still sleeps with me. Her bio-mom (and a few others) think that&#39;s terrible. <br/>\nMaybe this comes from her bio-mom leaving her at the age of 26 months. Maybe it&#39;s from the abuse she suffered at her bio-moms hands. (Her Ernie doll was traded for a bag of heroin, her car seat - gone; etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nBrianna has some fears. I&#39;ll not be adding to them.<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, April 11, 2003 2:10 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] getting back to unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 4/11/03 10:08:23 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jana@...\">jana@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; What about the fact that the bible was censored/translated by men - under <br/>\n  the direction of King James - who definately had his own aganda? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s not about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Those who want to learn about the Bible are lucky to have GOOGLE.COM!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I love Google.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
