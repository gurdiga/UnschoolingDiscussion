They spent HOURS together talking<br/>\ntechnology. Trevor learned a ton of stuff from Jay and was given all<br/>\nsorts of old parts to learn with. He ended up building a really good<br/>\ncomputer (which I am using right now) and feeling confident enough to<br/>\nlearn it all himself now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t overstate the value of good mentors....people that have<br/>\naquired a high level of skill in something and are willing to simply<br/>\nhang out and share their interests. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53824,"nextTopicId":37575}}
