What does it mean? Author<br/>\n  and educator Steve Van Matre, takes a hard-hitting look <br/>\n  at one of the most used buzzwords of our times. <br/>\n<br/>\n* WORKING WITH SIMPLICITY: THE CASE FOR PART-TIME WORK<br/>\n  By Linda Breen Pierce<br/>\n  Reducing the time that you spend working for money can <br/>\n  allow you more time for family, friends, personal growth, <br/>\n  volunteering, and changing the world. Linda reminds us <br/>\n  that there&#39;s more to life than the nine to five <br/>\n  treadmill, and suggests ways we might make the change to <br/>\n  fewer work hours in our own lives. <br/>\n<br/>\n* FINDING MEANING IN A CUP OF COFFEE<br/>\n  By Rodney North<br/>\n  Chances are you&#39;re staring at your morning cup of coffee <br/>\n  right now. Where did it come from? How was it grown? Who <br/>\n  picked the beans? Oh yeah, and how does it taste? For <br/>\n  many Americans the answers are: &quot;don&#39;t know, don&#39;t know, <br/>\n  don&#39;t know,&quot; and &quot;eh, it&#39;s okay.&quot; A group of <br/>\n  businesspeople are betting that there are enough <br/>\n  consumers of coffee who would love to purchase a product <br/>\n  that is good for the environment, pays a living wage for <br/>\n  its workers, and tastes great. <br/>\n<br/>\n* THE FUTURE BELONGS TO BUTTERFLIES<br/>\n  By Mark A Burch<br/>\n  Ecologists predict that our current levels of population <br/>\n  growth, consumption, resource use, and environmental <br/>\n  impact will result in one big global environmental crisis <br/>\n  within the next 50 years or so. While some people are <br/>\n  predicting the worst, or doing their best to reduce their <br/>\n  impact, others are blithely ignoring -- or covering up -- <br/>\n  potential problems. In this article Mark Burch assesses <br/>\n  the role of voluntary simplicity among the array of our <br/>\n  society&#39;s other responses to potential environmental <br/>\n  crisis.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21240,"nextTopicId":21246}}
