But, last year our local newspaper <br/>\nprinted and <br/>\n&gt; essay I wrote for Mother&#39;s Day, regarding this issue - because my <br/>\nmother is a <br/>\n&gt; compulsive cleaner as well.  I copied it for you and I hope the <br/>\nrest of the <br/>\n&gt; loop gets a chuckle too!  Whether you are the &quot;compulsive cleaner&quot; <br/>\nor the <br/>\n&gt; &quot;quick stash in the drawer type&quot; I think everyone can relate.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dawn <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A Matter of Style<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My mother only had one child.  She always had a spotless house that <br/>\nshe <br/>\n&gt; cleaned, scrubbed and polished all day long on Friday&#39;s when I was <br/>\na child.  <br/>\n&gt; She also did all the laundry on the same day; it never sat in a <br/>\nbasket <br/>\n&gt; unfolded or not put away.  There was never any clutter around on <br/>\nthe counter <br/>\n&gt; or in the bedroom.  Everything had a place and everything was in <br/>\nits place - <br/>\n&gt; always.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have three children.  I had them in 4 ½ years.  They are now 7 ½,<br/>\n&gt; 5 and 3, two boys and a girl; in that order.  I clean when I can; <br/>\nmostly when <br/>\n&gt; I absolutely have to!  My laundry rarely gets completed on the same <br/>\nday it is <br/>\n&gt; started; often a basket may sit waiting to be folded or put away.  <br/>\nPiles of <br/>\n&gt; clutter decorate my kitchen and bedroom, they get smaller and <br/>\nbigger, but <br/>\n&gt; never seem to disappear completely.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My mom made home cooked meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I <br/>\nwas a <br/>\n&gt; teenager when she went back to work full-time and then my dad took <br/>\nover, <br/>\n&gt; cooking dinner each night.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The breakfasts I prepare come out of a box and sometimes go into <br/>\nthe toaster <br/>\n&gt; oven.  Lunches may be prepared; but a few stops for fast food <br/>\nduring the week <br/>\n&gt; is common.  Dinner, since we live in a mother-daughter house with <br/>\nmy parents, <br/>\n&gt; is still home cooked - by my dad.  Or we go out, mostly all <br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My mom knew that when she put something away it would remain <br/>\nthere.  If she <br/>\n&gt; cleaned, I knew better than to mess it up and would be careful with <br/>\nwhat I <br/>\n&gt; did play with and of course, always put it away.  She could count <br/>\non peace <br/>\n&gt; and quiet when she needed it - one child to hush usually does <br/>\nlisten well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know the minute I pick up the Legos they will be out again.  The <br/>\npuzzles <br/>\n&gt; will be dumped and the toys will be littered throughout the house.  <br/>\nI can <br/>\n&gt; count on the bathroom floor and the toilet being piddled on minutes <br/>\nafter <br/>\n&gt; &quot;the big clean&quot; or the &quot;quick wipe up&quot;.  Getting a few minutes <br/>\npeace to call <br/>\n&gt; the insurance company or a doctor&#39;s office is a trick when there <br/>\nare little <br/>\n&gt; personalities reacting with each other all day.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My mom was the greatest mom around.  She was young and I always <br/>\nconsidered <br/>\n&gt; her a &quot;cool&quot; mom, unlike friends who were embarrassed by theirs.  <br/>\nShe always <br/>\n&gt; managed to have time for me in spite of the fact that she kept <br/>\na &quot;perfect&quot; <br/>\n&gt; house.  I know the reality is that one child, as opposed to three, <br/>\nmade that <br/>\n&gt; an easier task but there are some days when the guilt of not living <br/>\nup to the <br/>\n&gt; example she set weighs very heavy on my mind.  Not only when she <br/>\ngives a <br/>\n&gt; disapproving gaze around the house, but when I take a good look <br/>\nalso.  Most <br/>\n&gt; days there just isn&#39;t time to do it all.  It seems impossible stay <br/>\nahead of <br/>\n&gt; their needs and to keep the house looking under control.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But mostly I find that I have made a choice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Instead of cleaning, I choose to let my kids sit on my lap and <br/>\nwatch cartoons <br/>\n&gt; with them.  I know all the characters and all the stories.  Unlike <br/>\nfriends I <br/>\n&gt; have, I am never surprised by what my kids have on the television.  <br/>\nNothing <br/>\n&gt; they watch has missed Mom&#39;s review first.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Instead of vacuuming today, I read my kids a story.  My eldest was <br/>\nan early <br/>\n&gt; reader and I expect his brother, my middle son to be the same.  My <br/>\ndaughter <br/>\n&gt; often hands me a book and climbs into my lap.  They love to be read <br/>\nto and <br/>\n&gt; love to read to me.  I am so happy to have passed on to them <br/>\nsomething I <br/>\n&gt; loved so much from my childhood.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Instead of doing the rest of the laundry, I sang the Hokey Pokey <br/>\nand we all <br/>\n&gt; danced.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess I take after my mom after all. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Zahmiller@aol.com","from":"Zahmiller@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"n14XAiBDGtlDicwoDEpLtYpuyedKKXtISlbdM-xcAzaPTfCnqHLcoMCL2ZuHZsknWaNRVWgaPE0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Housecleaning was opp&#39;s opinion, family bed, etc.","postDate":"980385454","msgId":15354,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxLmY2OWJjYmMuMjdhMGQ4YWVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15395,"prevInTime":15353,"nextInTime":15355,"topicId":15354,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/24/2001 4:39:25 PM Pacific Standard Time, ...
