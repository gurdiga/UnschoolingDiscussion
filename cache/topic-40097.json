Every year we had to face the friends, neighbors and<br/>\npeople we didn&#39;t even know at holiday times as I was brought up Jewish<br/>\nin a Christian society. So no Christmas tree or Easter egg hunts. We did<br/>\nhave the perks of staying home from school on Jewish holidays, and the<br/>\nbroadening of our cultural horizons by knowing interesting people  and<br/>\nour own holidays, and visiting Israel. This was not an individual<br/>\ncommitment at that time, so we had much more support, but your son will<br/>\ngrow in character from your respect for him and in facing others who are<br/>\nignorant of why he chose his path. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can keep getting more information on what&#39;s right about his<br/>\ndecision, both compassion-wise and health-wise that you and he can share<br/>\nwith others and perhaps educate them. I would recommend you seek out<br/>\nothers who are acting on the strength of their compassion. Perhaps you<br/>\ncould go to a veggie pot luck and meeting. Get a vegetarian cookbook out<br/>\nof the library and make some new dishes and one to share with others.<br/>\nYou might find people he likes to be with on this or at least just see<br/>\nthat there are other people who believe and act similarly. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are others things he can do with his commitment too. Show him (and<br/>\nyourself) that not all others are indifferent to these concerns. You can<br/>\nfind groups both on the internet and probably in your local area who<br/>\nbelieve in animal rights and work to save them. This would include<br/>\nactivist groups who expose and protest against &quot;factory farming&quot; and<br/>\ninhumane treatment of animals for commercial purposes, as well as<br/>\nvegetarian groups. Maybe you&#39;ll both make a donation to such a group, or<br/>\nwrite a letter to a legislature to change a law. If you keep expanding<br/>\nyour and his knowledge and experiences in this area, you&#39;ll both be able<br/>\nto hold your position better and better.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you talk about character building to your friend who thinks you are<br/>\nnuts, perhaps she&#39;ll get a reality adjustment. People end up taking<br/>\ndrugs these days instead of learning how to deal with life or live up to<br/>\ntheir intentions. Hold firm, girl! You and your son are setting a good<br/>\nexample for others: he is acting on what he believes in and you are<br/>\nbacking him up. Congratulations, and welcome to humanity with all its<br/>\ngood intentions and flaws. He&#39;ll be able to hold his own position and<br/>\nconsult his own conscience better in the future because of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I need a support group today and you all are going to have to be it for me!<br/>\n&gt; My six year old son read Charlotte&#39;s Web, loved the book, hated the part<br/>\n&gt; about killing animals for food, spent a couple days thinking and talking<br/>\n&gt; about it, and decided he&#39;s never eating meat again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I took him seriously, and believe in his right to make decisions about his<br/>\n&gt; life. &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I truly believe I&#39;m doing the right thing here.

His friends don&#39;t care, but their<br/>\nparents laugh at him, about him, treat it like it&#39;s a silly little phase or<br/>\nsomething abhorant.  We had an family BBQ with army folks my dh works with,<br/>\nand people acted like we&#39;re wrong for not just making him eat meat, and must<br/>\nhave no control as parents.  All this for taking a child seriously?!<br/>\n<br/>\nI truly believe I&#39;m doing the right thing here.  But my best friend just<br/>\ntold me how stupid I&#39;m being about this (by &quot;humoring him&quot;-- her words, not<br/>\nmine), and I need some support.  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\nwho&#39;s trying to remember somebody&#39;s tag line, &quot;what you think of me is none<br/>\nof my business&quot;, but having a hard time with it today....</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40228,"nextTopicId":40295}}
