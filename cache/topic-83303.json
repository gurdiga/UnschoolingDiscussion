Unfortunately they are <br/>\nnot supportive as the makers of Claratin were (so I, for one, will <br/>\nuse the power of my *purchasing dollars*!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for contacting us directly to tell us of your reaction to <br/>\nthe CBS Evening News segment.  It gives us the chance to express to <br/>\nyou the thinking that guides our advertising decisions.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe issues involved are tough ones, full of controversy and <br/>\nemotion.  We take your comments very seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nKraft is always concerned about the media environment in which our<br/>\nadvertising appears and we have rigorous policies governing the <br/>\nplacement of our ads.  We enforce ourpolicies to the best of <br/>\nour ability.  From time to time, we are asked to use the power of our<br/>\nadvertising dollars to intervene in the editorial policies of the <br/>\nmedia -- to influence newscoverage on this network or <br/>\ndrive a personality off the air at that station.  Each time, we <br/>\ndecline,explaining that viewers and listeners are the arbiters, not <br/>\nadvertisers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this clarifies the situation.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83251,"nextTopicId":82237}}
