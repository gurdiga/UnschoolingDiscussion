The<br/>\nscience, math, history and English classes are team taught and integrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I was lucky as I am both a book and math person and although I was<br/>\nnever a science person I still got a lot of info from science classes and<br/>\nnever a feeling of not getting the complete picture.  And, even though I was<br/>\ngenerally bored to death in school, most of my negative experiences came<br/>\nfrom students, not teachers.  Well, other than I found most of them to be,<br/>\nshall we say, limited in their abilities &lt;g&gt;  But by then I had &quot;found&quot; the<br/>\nlibrary and the librarians were always more than happy to help with my<br/>\nquestions and never seemed to be put off by a bunch of questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the only time I got the &quot;smart ass&quot; routine was in the 4th grade<br/>\nand they moved me into a 4, 5 and 6 class.  That got rid of the boredom for<br/>\nthat year but of course that left me with no where to go in the 5th grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got to high school I finally got some really good teachers who could<br/>\nbring their subjects to life.  Our chemistry teacher had been in special<br/>\nforces or CIA or some such thing and he was the original two left feet,<br/>\nnutty professor so his class was always &quot;interesting,&quot; and we all lived to<br/>\ntell about it &lt;g&gt;  We had a geometry teacher who was an ex-Marine drill<br/>\nsargent who was interesting too.  And an algebra teacher that was wayyyyyyy<br/>\nahead of his time (this was about &#39;61) and turned the class into a computer<br/>\nand because of the way he taught, everyone &quot;got it,&quot; even the kids that came<br/>\ninto the class math phobic or failing math.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I loved English until Ms. Peabody (yes, that was her real name) who<br/>\ncould turn an honors English major into a 1.0 gpa in no time flat!  I only<br/>\nhave two memories of her class, one, I hated it and two, the day she asked<br/>\nme where Timbucto was.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the warm fuzzies really have to do with how good the teacher is, IMHO,<br/>\nnot what your favorite subjects are.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to book burning, if you were/are a public figure who says Ezzo&#39;s book<br/>\nshould be burned, then I&#39;d have to say you get to be in the same column as<br/>\nthe guy in Texas.<br/>\n<br/>\nYa see, the way I see it, if everyone gets to decide what books to gather<br/>\nup, remove from public consumption and burn, then their won&#39;t be any books<br/>\nat all.  I&#39;d much prefer to see open dialogue, information exchanged and an<br/>\nalternative looked for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally would like to see Ezzo burned but I&#39;m not going to get on some<br/>\ncommittee and make that recommendation &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 06, 2001 5:12 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Nuttier Than A Bag Of Nuts At ANutFestival<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; on 11/5/01 10:30 AM, Lynda at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I do think that science should be taught as science and not from a<br/>\npolitical<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or economic standpoint.

(Though some probably do.) I think it&#39;s because the book teaches<br/>\n&gt; something they think is bad. It&#39;s a subtle but important difference that<br/>\n&gt; helps us gain insight into the way people we disagree with think.
