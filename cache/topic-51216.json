Their<br/>\nfather was mysteriously ill and their mother had gone with him out of<br/>\nstate to different specialists.   My nieces were 7, 8 and 12 at the time.<br/>\nThe seven year old always went rocking with her mom at bed time and her<br/>\nmother, who has a lovely  voice would sing softly to her.  <br/>\nSo Emily asked me to rock her an sing.  I knew the song she wanted, and<br/>\nalthough I&#39;m no singer, I figured she&#39;s seven right? How good do I have<br/>\nto be?<br/>\nAfter I sang for awhile she gently touched my cheek and said, &quot;That&#39;s ok,<br/>\nTia, you can stop now.&quot;  &lt;G&gt;<br/>\nWe kept rocking and after a little bit she asked maybe if I could just<br/>\nhum...  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe still remembers because when she&#39;s here and we play the piano she<br/>\nalways reminds me it&#39;s ok if I don&#39;t want to sing.   She&#39;s 11 now, such<br/>\nan annoying child.&lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51208,"nextTopicId":51217}}
