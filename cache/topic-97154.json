When we were coming back from New Hampshire two weeks<br/>\nago, we got caught in a massive traffic jam because of torrential downpours<br/>\nin NY/ NJ. We were stuck on the Cross Bronx Expressway for 4.5 hours trying<br/>\nto cross the bridge into North Jersey. What should have been a 4.5 to 5 hour<br/>\ntrip total, turned into an 11 hour drive!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I kept thinking was &quot;We are together and safe. We were not in an<br/>\naccident; the van is not totalled and no one is hurt. We are all healthy.&quot; I<br/>\ncan&#39;t tell you what a difference that made, and I really believe that my<br/>\nattitude and mental state kept the kids calm and happy even though dh was<br/>\ngetting visibly stressed out. Of course, the VCR in the van helped a bit,<br/>\ntoo! ;) I just kept passing out snacks, refilling waters and helping the<br/>\nkids pee in a bucket when they had to, which we just poured out the window.<br/>\nAll the kids just took it in stride, which is pretty amazing, considering<br/>\nthey&#39;re 7, 5 and 4 and strapped in a carseat for 11 hours straight.

I <br/>\ndon&#39;t mean this as a criticism - not saying you should not complain <br/>\nbecause others have it worse, or anything like that. I&#39;m saying to try, <br/>\nspecifically, to say say specific words to yourself at the moment that <br/>\nyou&#39;re being stressed by the kids&#39; behavior. Right then, at that <br/>\nmoment, say to yourself, &quot;I have healthy, inquisitive, <br/>\nenergetic....kids.&quot; Self-talk is important. Use it to get yourself over <br/>\nthe rougher times - don&#39;t allow it to make rough times even rougher. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis helped me a lot when Marty was peeing the bed even when he was big, 8.  <br/>\nI cleaned up after him, or bought disposable small-adult sized diapers, and I <br/>\nthought loving thoughts.  And I reminded myself that some people have children <br/>\nwho have to be changed in the bed all day and night their whole lives.  I <br/>\nhave a friend who became quadraplegic at the age of 24, sliding on snow, on an <br/>\ninnertube in the mountains.   I have helped take care of her.  Cathether.  Bowel <br/>\nprogram.  Feeding by hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll Marty needed was supplies and encouragement and time.<br/>\nMarty could get up and sit on the toilet just fine.  <br/>\nHe could get up and take a shower.  <br/>\nAll I had to do was furnish diapers and do some extra laundry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI could have worked up a HUGE frustration and anger and resentment storm and <br/>\nshamed him and blamed him and felt sorry for myself about having a big boy who <br/>\npeed his bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy attitude made a massive difference in my life and his, and his brother&#39;s, <br/>\nhis sister&#39;s and his dad&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will make a difference in Marty&#39;s future wife&#39;s life, and his children if <br/>\nany, whether or not they&#39;re late to sleep dry all night.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it was a concious choice on my part.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone left this list lately, and specifically complained about my having <br/>\nsuggested people be glad they don&#39;t have kids who are disabled.   I think it&#39;s <br/>\nhealthy and wonderful to see the blessings in our lives, and the joys, and the <br/>\nbenefits.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone at unschooling.com was trying to talk herself out of being more <br/>\ngentle and present with her children because she had one who had died.  She was <br/>\nafraid she was being too soft, I guess.  So what?  She DID have a child die.  <br/>\nThat SHOULD change her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing appreciative and loving shouldn&#39;t be things to be ashamed of, but I <br/>\nknow why they are.  Because we are generally of an overall couple of cultures <br/>\nwhich have taught hard work and deprivation as virtues.   People from other <br/>\ncultures have been branded lazy by the predominant cultures, and so people tend <br/>\ntoward seeing success as being the ideal, and emotional comfort as NOT ideal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn unhappy mother will not create happy children or a happy home.<br/>\nA mother who clings to her frustrations self-righteously and criticizes those <br/>\nwho try to help her soften and relax is not moving toward more happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97244,"nextTopicId":97227}}
