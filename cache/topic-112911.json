That stuff is so ingrained in<br/>\nus.  Unschooling encapsulates ideas that have sent us in some growing,<br/>\nhappier directions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m learning more by posting my questions and thoughts than I have by<br/>\nreading (and so much can be had just by reading).  Saying the words<br/>\nfor what I&#39;m doing in a circle of people who live unschooling.  I need<br/>\nthat.  I live in an area where people who are or have been unschooling<br/>\nare nowhere to be found.  I wouldn&#39;t be able to get it together<br/>\nwithout some help.  And having people to talk with online means so much.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDh is not convinced but not adamantly opposed to unschooling as he was<br/>\nlast year.  He *is* beginning to understand the point of a rich<br/>\nenvironment which is great! even if he can&#39;t bring himself to support<br/>\nunschooling.  He definitely wants to homeschool ds who is now only 2<br/>\n1/2, and he sees how ds learns things all the time, things we haven&#39;t<br/>\nspent time trying to teach him.

I&#39;ve only travelled once out of the US.  Mexico<br/>\nin the early 90s.  Americans look so weird there. I squirmed a lot<br/>\nwhile on excursions.  I wanted to get some Mexican dust on my clothes<br/>\nand shoes, and on my soul too.  We&#39;re too affluent and reliant on our<br/>\nwealth for my comfort.  I&#39;ve never felt wealthy before or so ashamed<br/>\nof it.  I&#39;m sure the relative importance of money isn&#39;t the only<br/>\ndifference.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also think there&#39;s a reality in any collection of humans, that only  <br/>\n&gt; so many will be leaders and the majority will be followers.  And one  <br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t just &quot;a leader&quot; or &quot;a follower.&quot;  There&#39;s an instinct to  <br/>\n&gt; follow, and sometimes leading become inevitable.  It can come down to  <br/>\n&gt; who&#39;s the most qualified and pressured to lead, in small emergency  <br/>\n&gt; situations.  And in largescale times of peace, lots of potential  <br/>\n&gt; leaders can chill.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Leadership can be a lot like teaching.  Not everybody is qualified. <br/>\nAlso some things and people that should lead haven&#39;t the voice or<br/>\ncalling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYourself.  The most important follower you&#39;ll ever have, the most<br/>\nessential of leaders.  It&#39;s not originally my thought that everybody<br/>\nleads and everybody follows, even if they don&#39;t realize it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m getting at is we&#39;re led in varying and often conflicting ways<br/>\nby other things and people, and choices arise even if we&#39;re barely<br/>\nconscious of them.  Leaders come in so many stripes: I come after a<br/>\nton of ancestors, back to how long?  I am younger than a whole bunch<br/>\nof people.  I come after them as well as people younger than me who<br/>\nhave done things I haven&#39;t done, which one day I will do or attempt to<br/>\ndo.  *Things* influence me too, such as instinct, heredity, culture<br/>\nand so on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDecisions decisions.  I have no way of knowing for sure if I follow<br/>\nsimply because something or someone&#39;s idea seems the most pressing at<br/>\nthe time, although I might think I have my reasons in a row like so<br/>\nmany ducks.  I mean, how many decisions does a person make everyday? <br/>\nThousands at least, I would think.  All important to some degree or<br/>\nyou wouldn&#39;t do anything to decide them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLeadership, especially leading your own life, means deciding what is<br/>\nmost crucial and to what purpose.  Yeah... and it&#39;s what makes<br/>\nunschooling so mindbendingly difficult to incorporate into life.  To<br/>\ndistance yourself from seemingly harmless influences that block it<br/>\nwhile you maintain a balance and hold onto reality.  I think it&#39;s<br/>\nnecessary to become aware and to remind yourself of influences that<br/>\nhave tainted you.  Yet a sort of burgeoning *instinct* needs to<br/>\ndevelop in order to make radical/wholelife unschooling doable in the<br/>\nlong run, so that life together is doable and fun.  Of course at first<br/>\nyou bend your mind, wrap your head around so many aspects, in order to<br/>\n*not* take them for granted.  Eventually I hope to get where I don&#39;t<br/>\ncarefully consciously decide what fits me and my spouse and<br/>\nchild(ren)&#39;s needs, so much as breathe naturally and consider it<br/>\ntogether from a tranquil place.  At least more often than I do now. <br/>\nNot complaining so much as hoping.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I think that has to do with parents needing to be honest and  <br/>\n&gt; open and thoughtful is two parts:  People can&#39;t just blindly follow  <br/>\n&gt; along with unschooling.  It has to be internalized in each  <br/>\n&gt; responsible parent.  One who doesn&#39;t get it can&#39;t convincingly or  <br/>\n&gt; effectively Do it.  And within the family, no matter how egalitarian  <br/>\n&gt; the family is set up to be, the parents are the leaders, THEY decided  <br/>\n&gt; on an egalitarian arrangement, and need to manage that and sell it  <br/>\n&gt; and make it real.  They can&#39;t do that if they don&#39;t really mean what  <br/>\n&gt; they say and practice what they preach.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All this is unschooling and mindful parenting is harder than it  <br/>\n&gt; looks. &lt;g&gt;  Simple but not easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is where my &quot;AMEN&quot; comes in.  Unschooling is *definitely* not a<br/>\nlazy thing-to-follow/life-to-lead.

It&#39;s that &quot;we&quot;<br/>\nthing that many have talked about on this and other discussion boards;<br/>\nthat while it&#39;s in operation between parent(s)/child, it forms a sort<br/>\nof borg-ish monopoly on real relationship.

I don&#39;t like to think such relationships are<br/>\na reality...  that in the dance of control, *Trust* remains a<br/>\nnon-issue, or a precarious potentiality that doesn&#39;t yet exist and is<br/>\ncontinually out of reach, or perhaps even a word for manipulating<br/>\nothers.

The interesting<br/>\nthing to me is the strong development of the individual voice in<br/>\nmodern times directly across from society.  Where moderacy may have<br/>\noccasion to show up.  Conscience counts for something in the life of<br/>\nthe one person who lives it, and that something is what each<br/>\nindividual is made up of, at their unique heart of hearts.  &quot;What life<br/>\ndo I want to live?&quot; is a good question, even if I&#39;m not unschooling,<br/>\nbut paramount if I *am* unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Mar 21, 2006, at 12:45 PM, katherand2003 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Otherwise, children may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grow to believe that kids are automatically wrong and adults are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; automatically right.
