And explained that it seems that he is tired or <br/>\nhungary because I see xyz. We have done this enough times that he <br/>\nsays &quot;I&#39;m tired, I need a nap.&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m hungary, I want food.&quot;<br/>\nMore recently, he has begun saying &quot;I want to go nite-nite&quot;. Other <br/>\ntimes he is too engaged to stop, but the message is the same later.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is never any punishment for these behaviors. The behaviors are <br/>\nhis body telling him information. I try to help him have the words <br/>\nfor describing what is happening to his body. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, when I am getting tired or hungary, I tell him I am <br/>\ngetting grouchy, I need to eat or rest. And tell him that my body <br/>\nfeels healthier afterwards. Erik now tells me &quot;my body doesn&#39;t feel <br/>\nhealthy, I need to sleep&quot; or to eat. He does these things that HIS <br/>\nbody told him it needs, and he says &quot;I feel better&quot;. The point is *I* <br/>\nam not telling him what to do or what his body needs. I am telling <br/>\nwhat I see and how it impacts me. This has been empowering to him and <br/>\nrelaxing my need to monitor him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps. <br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jeanne Goodman&quot; <br/>\n&lt;goodmanj@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;One thing great about unschooling is that we don&#39;t have set <br/>\n </span></blockquote>bedtimes ( well, we never did really!).

The only <br/>\nproblem is . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a few ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids don&#39;t &quot;choose their own bedtime.&quot;<br/>\nThey go to sleep when they&#39;re sleepy.  That&#39;s a different thing.  It helps, <br/>\nI&#39;m sure, that they&#39;ve never had &quot;a bedtime,&quot; but if kids think they have a <br/>\nbedtie but they get to pick when it is, they still &quot;have a bedtime.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might seem a subtle difference, maybe, to people who are new to the idea, <br/>\nbut I think it&#39;s big.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf bedtime used to be 9:00, but a child is tired at 7:30, and if the <br/>\nprinciple is &quot;go to bed when you&#39;re sleepy,&quot; he&#39;ll go to bed at 7:30 if he&#39;s sleepy.  <br/>\nOr at midnight.   But it will be about sleepiness, not bedtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s been just a short while and their used to be strict rules, they will <br/>\nstill be frolicking in the freedom.  Just as it takes a while to deschool and <br/>\nfor kids to find joy in what used to be &quot;school subjects&quot; (they might never, <br/>\never find joy in school-appearing schoolwork), any change from rules to <br/>\nprinciples will take a while for pendulum-swing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-They are staying up later and later every day but not waking up much later.<br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you require them to get up at a certain time before?  It&#39;s hard to break <br/>\na habit like that, especially if you used to get in trouble if you got up <br/>\nlater.  It might be a long time before they can break that conditioning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":83822299,"authorName":"Jeanne Goodman","from":"&quot;Jeanne Goodman&quot; &lt;goodmanj@...&gt;","profile":"desksideguru","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Bedtimes","postDate":"1089941894","msgId":96249,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA0NTcwMWM0NmFkNSRlNjM5MjZlMCQ2NTAwYThjMEBMYXB0b3A+","referencesHeader":"PGNkMjIxZytwcWtqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDA1MDAxYzQ2OWVlJDE4MGFhNDIwJDAxMDAwMDBhQHZpYy5iaWdwb25kLm5ldC5hdT4="},"prevInTopic":43145,"nextInTopic":96250,"prevInTime":96248,"nextInTime":96250,"topicId":12225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1856667882\">&lt;&lt;One thing great about unschooling is that we don&#39;t have set bedtimes ( well, we never did really!).

I think one of the areas that we are running into trouble here is with my dh.  In the past, the kids and I were always in bed by 10 and my dh had a quiet house to himself.  He would go to bed between 11:30 and midnight.  Now we are all up until midnight and he is grouchy about the noise.  So even though we have told them they can set their own bedtime we are now battling about noise.  He is being a little inflexible because one night he stormed out of bed because he heard them talking.  They said something like &quot;where do you want to sleep tonight?&quot; I would prefer to just ignore the issue and let it settle down on its own.  Dh feel his rights are being compromised.  I&#39;m always the one in the middle trying to do what is right for everyone.

We put a code on our television for the nighttime hours so that <br/>\nit can only be accessed if we know about it and the computer is off limits <br/>\nonly because my son tends to explore the operating system which with <br/>\nsupervision I don&#39;t mind, but he&#39;s been known to crash the entire system if <br/>\nnot watched LOL. I keep a stack of books in the toyroom and sometimes we&#39;ll <br/>\nwake up in the morning to find him crashed on the toyroom couch with a book <br/>\nand a lego spaceship. I don&#39;t make a big deal about this however. It&#39;s hard <br/>\nto define that bedtime line sometimes LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nKimberly U  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NumoAstro@aol.com","from":"NumoAstro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"bX3Y8cOIc3TKKn2Y92CYXJU6O3OkHLKZ_fdd0RzpI82iivboxhc_ct2wSBZZ5Ai-JO6alXtfV14","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Bedtimes","postDate":"999750761","msgId":24227,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyMi40Mjg2YTM0LjI4Yzg1NjY5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":24192,"nextInTopic":24235,"prevInTime":24226,"nextInTime":24228,"topicId":12225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/5/01 6:26:11 PM US Mountain Standard Time, ...

We have a 14 yo and he&#39;s gone through <br/>\nso many bedtime stages over the past year.  Right now his favorite time is <br/>\nnight time.  He&#39;s usually up all night long, reading, playing on the computer, <br/>\nreading some more, chatting on-line and usually hits the pillow around 3-5AM.  <br/>\nThen all of a sudden he&#39;ll decide that he wants to be awake during the day so <br/>\nwe can do some activities together and he&#39;ll stay up all day until he totally <br/>\ncrashes and switch his schedule to a &quot;normal&quot; schedule for a week or so.  Then <br/>\nbefore you know it, something&#39;s happens that keeps him up all night and we&#39;re <br/>\noff again.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo say that we have to sleep at night is so restricting.  There are so many <br/>\nthings that can happen during the night hours that we don&#39;t worry about when <br/>\nhe&#39;s up or down.  Not too long ago there was the meteor shower that the best <br/>\ntime to observe it was after midnight so away we went - up to the mountains to <br/>\nwatch this great event.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it gets annoying... when he gets involved in a computer game at 2 in <br/>\nthe morning and all you can hear (when I want to sleep) is the sound of boom-<br/>\nboom... and Sean giggling!!!  But I guess those are the nights I&#39;m not sleeping <br/>\nthat heavily anyway... oh well, this too shall pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeanmarie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*********************************<br/>\nGet your free E-Mail and Homepage<br/>\nGo to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.networld.com\">http://www.networld.com</a><br/>\n*********************************</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Cararmst@aol.com","from":"Cararmst@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"9iVkL_He5SSVETfIMrY06cr77AzGgz-oqQvhctbxmj6gfDdf1npDIwzz2-HEFvqetmgd3Niblw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Bedtimes","postDate":"967482609","msgId":12225,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEzLmFhYTlmNmEuMjZkYmY2ZjFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":24185,"prevInTime":12224,"nextInTime":12226,"topicId":12225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We don t enforce a bedtime, but we do expect the kids to be upstairs by 9:00 or so.
