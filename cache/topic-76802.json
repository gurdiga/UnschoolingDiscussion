I think about that street all the time. We have a great big back yard but the only way to get to our cars is to go outside the front way, right next to all of those cars racing down the road. Now, when I say I think about this often, I mean it! I have a newly turned three year old rambunctious energetic little girl. She loves to run from me, she loves to hide from me, she thinks all of these games are hysterical:) I do the same exact thing that your friend did with his son, with my little Sadie. Every day when we go out there I explain this to her, that I love her so much that I want her to always be with me (and her two sisters) and those cars out there could really hurt her. I tell her if she is acting particularly impatient that day, that this scares me, please hold my hand... and do you know, that kid knows a heck of a lot about cars for a three year old. She practically could<br/>\n cross the street on her own (not that I would ever let her now) she looks both ways and she holds onto my hands. I couldnt imagine hitting her over this... I really couldn&#39;t. Kelli<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Lisa M.

I am not his adversary.<br/>\nHe had three melt downs at the health food co-op the other day. Each time I talked calmly until he listened and then explained to him that the candy he wanted had to be paid for first (only because it was in bulk) and then I would give it to him.

She <br/>\nwas adopted by my aunt and uncle when she was 1 week old. She was born crack <br/>\naddicted along with fetal alchohol syndrome. She was born at 30 weeks <br/>\njustation and was a mere 3 lbs at birth. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what makes the story so sad. Her parents (my Aunt & Uncle) lost their <br/>\n25+ yr marriage primarily due to her issues. I&#39;m not saying she is to blame, <br/>\nbut her problems are the most extensive I have ever seen. Everyone in my <br/>\nfamily has been on this journey of searching out any and all theories, <br/>\nalternatives, meds, you name it, it has been done. That is why in one of my posts, I said <br/>\nthe poor thing has more labels than the cans in my pantry. I meant that. The <br/>\nlist just seems to grow and the answers thus far have never helped. She is 14 <br/>\nand has the maturity of maybe an 8 year old on a really good day. She has a <br/>\nvery high IQ, but cannot cope with minute to minute life. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t that I anticipate anyone knowing any of the answers we have <br/>\ndesparately searched for for all these years, rather that I could identify with Oom&#39;s <br/>\nstory on a personal level. I just think sometimes we judge so harshly without <br/>\nknowing the circumstances. There may never be an answer that is going to make <br/>\nher life have a positive outcome, but we still hope everyday. We have all had <br/>\npeople ask us how we could possibly love such a child. The answer is, it takes <br/>\nwork but she is still worthy of being loved. She is still a child. She has <br/>\nissues most people will never deal with in their whole lifetimes, wrapped up in <br/>\none body. <br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda - who of course believes she did in fact choose this life karmically <br/>\nspeaking, but doesn&#39;t think that negates her need to be loved in spite of that <br/>\nchoice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] A drug problem","postDate":"1058667364","msgId":76806,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyNzYwMWMzNGU2NCRlZTE1YWQ0MCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDI3LjQ0YjllNjUwLjJjNGI1MGEzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76805,"nextInTopic":76807,"prevInTime":76805,"nextInTime":76807,"topicId":76802,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.

A joyful, happy person, but NOT compliant in any way, nor is he an easy child comparitively. I am very , very selective about where we go and at what time of day because certain places/times are almost sure to bring about a meltdown if I&#39;m not properly prepared.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut isn&#39;t that our job as parents? To know and understand the child development phases and know our own children well enough to be creative and thoughtful where their temperments are concerned?<br/>\nIf I had an intense child that was sure NOT to hold my hand in a dangerous area, and I knew this about them, it&#39;s MY fault if I get us into a situation, not the childs!!! yikes.<br/>\nA backpack works wonders. If a three year old is too large for the backpack, then make sure you have a free hand. There are always many options to avoid hitting people and treating children with disrespect.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, in a life threatening situation a child will get my protection whether they want it or not, they would want it if they truly understood what was happening. So knowing that I am acting on their behalf, because they don&#39;t understand, is my job too.<br/>\nBut that&#39;s not what we need to discuss on this list.

My children have as much say in our activities as I do. If they didn&#39;t want to go to the library, we&#39;d compromise. There are always SO many solutions and I think it&#39;s ultra important for parents to consider children&#39;s requests, likes/dislikes as equally important to your own.<br/>\nThat isn&#39;t happening if the attitude is &quot;too bad, we HAVE to do this&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77193,"nextTopicId":76684}}
