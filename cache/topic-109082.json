We were at an away  high school football game Friday  night, <br/>\nsitting in front of friends.  Their 7 year old son and  his 7 yo friend, who <br/>\ncame with our friends, needed to go to the  restroom.  Mom and Dad thought it <br/>\nnecessary that they be accompanied to the  restroom, but weren&#39;t willing to do it <br/>\nright then, due to the game being at a  critical point.  (Really into sports, <br/>\nthese two.)  They looked around  for their older son, who wasn&#39;t around, but <br/>\nWill was sitting there near  me.<br/>\n <br/>\nThese parents were clearly not going to get up and take the boys to the  <br/>\nrestroom.  I could have made a point and offer to take them myself, but I  knew <br/>\nthey would have refused my help and still made the boys wait.  So I  asked Will <br/>\nif he would walk the boys to the restroom and he said, &quot;Sure!&quot; and  hopped <br/>\nright up.  <br/>\n <br/>\nEarlier in the game the mom had asked me if I was teaching Will long  <br/>\ndivision (she&#39;s a teacher).  I just said, &quot;naahh.&quot;  For Will&#39;s benefit  (he was there <br/>\nbeside me and listening), I said something like &quot;it&#39;s just a way  to write <br/>\ndown repeated subtraction...&quot; and I didn&#39;t get to finish because she  went on <br/>\nabout her older son not &quot;getting it&quot;, and then something happened that  drew our <br/>\nattention to the game.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe was grateful to Will for walking the boys to the restroom and thanked  <br/>\nhim a lot, but I know she&#39;s tallying up the score that Will is not learning long <br/>\n division, being older than her son who IS &quot;learning&quot; it in school, rather <br/>\nthan  seeing how kind and willing to help Will is.  He&#39;s willing to help  <br/>\nwithout even being cajoled or threatened or given the threatening stare by his  dad <br/>\nlike their son would have to be.  No points for Will for that,  though.  <br/>\n <br/>\nLuckily, Will couldn&#39;t care less.  Sorry for her kids though.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109065,"nextTopicId":108806}}
