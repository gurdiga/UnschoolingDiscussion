My son is<br/>\nin<br/>\na Suzuki piano program, and it is incredibly rewards based.  I was a bit<br/>\nconcerned at first, but have decided that if it works, it works.  His<br/>\nteacher<br/>\nassigns certain pieces to practice on a take home sheet.  He gets a check<br/>\nmark<br/>\nfor each day that he practices each piece.  When he reaches 100 check marks<br/>\n(usually every other week if he is diligent), he gets a candy bar or<br/>\nsomething<br/>\nelse from her drawer full of dollar store treasures.  He is also assigned a<br/>\n&quot;candy bar piece&quot; from time to time, and earns a trip to the wonderful<br/>\ndrawer<br/>\nof treasures for playing it flawlessly.  This keeps his practicing.  He has<br/>\ndiscovered in the course of his five months of lessons that there is an<br/>\nadditional reward of learning to play well, but I&#39;m sure that without the<br/>\nincentives, the practicing would stop or slow down.  This system is geared<br/>\ntoward the five and six year old students. Certainly there is some way to<br/>\ntailor this to an older child if you really would like to encourage her to<br/>\npractice.  So many check marks gets a video rental or a trip to the mall, or<br/>\nwhatever else works for you.  There is incentive to practice but no<br/>\npunishment<br/>\nfor not practicing.  It is like the poker chip game we used to play with our<br/>\nson when he was four and going through an &quot;unruly&quot; phase.  :o)  Just a<br/>\nthought.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n--</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49901,"nextTopicId":50005}}
