There&#39;s more learning for some people when it&#39;s <br/>\nheated up.  Some people fritz out when there&#39;s disagreement and they shut down <br/>\n(for reasons of personal history or their own stress-responses).   So if the <br/>\nlist is too peaceful it&#39;s boring, and if it&#39;s too confrontational some people <br/>\ncomplain of too much mail.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have several moderators, and some will let messages through that others <br/>\nwould have rejected and vice versa.  That&#39;s fine with the list owners.  A couple <br/>\nof people have complained and said all the moderators must agree, or they&#39;ve <br/>\nsaid &quot;Oh HUH&quot; to one moderator because another allowed something the first one <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have.    We don&#39;t have to agree.  We just all need to care about <br/>\nkeeping the list useful for a large number of people.  We can&#39;t have a list that <br/>\nevery person loves equally, because different people want different things.  <br/>\nOne person who left expressed disappointment because we were talking about <br/>\nparenting instead of about homeschooling resources.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best UNschooling resource any family can have involves good parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m not apologetic to people who say &quot;I came here to be told I was a good <br/>\nmom, not to be criticized.&quot;  As Joylyn wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;[I]t would be very <br/>\nsilly for me to say &quot;good job for sending your son to his room&quot; when I <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel that way. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t say &quot;good job&quot; to moms who want us to tell them that punishing their <br/>\nbad kids is a good idea, but to suggest that they might be a factor in that <br/>\nbehavior or unhappiness is a STUPID idea, and we&#39;re just mean to suggest that <br/>\nthey look at themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nLa Leche League with all their radical attachment parenting ideas probably <br/>\ngave me the main kernel of what became unschooling for me.  They said &quot;You and <br/>\nyour baby are partners.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a parent and a child are adversaries, whether about nursing, what to <br/>\nwear, when to sleep, what to eat, how to play, what to think, up and through <br/>\n&quot;school years&quot; and young adulthood, we end up seeing all the problems in some of <br/>\nthe worst families where parents try to control the children to become some <br/>\nvision of an idea child of thirty years before.   Instead of living on the <br/>\ncutting edge of now, they try to rein their kids in so that they specifically do NOT <br/>\nlive now, they live in a past fashion for a fantasy future.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat will be &quot;affirmed&quot; by many non-thinking people, agencies, businesses, <br/>\nmagazine covers, back-to-school ads, etc.    That will not, though, lead to <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":86758,"nextTopicId":86802}}
