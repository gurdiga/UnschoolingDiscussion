I<br/>\nhave not seen any that you couldn&#39;t see the children through. I kind of<br/>\nlike the idea of the net, not just for safety reasons, but because they<br/>\nare great to keep balls on the trampoline too. At their friends house,<br/>\nthey play jumping soccer and stuff, and use the net for the rebound. They<br/>\nalso play the popcorn game with a bunch of balls on it.
