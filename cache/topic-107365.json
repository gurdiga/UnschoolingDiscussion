We keep <br/>\na list of the month&#39;s activities and appointments (stuff we need to <br/>\nbe somewhere at a set time for) on the kitchen chalkboard so anyone <br/>\ncan check what and when and where at any time. We discuss the week <br/>\nahead on Sunday evening. We discuss the next day each evening around <br/>\ndinner. We discuss the day&#39;s plans in the morning. Whenever <br/>\npossible, we pack up, set out, etc whatever we&#39;ll need in the <br/>\nmorning the evening before. Sometimes, if we&#39;ve got 10 minutes <br/>\nbefore leaving and we&#39;re just kind of meandering, I&#39;ll set a timer <br/>\nto remind myself when we need to get going - note that the 10 <br/>\nminutes is until we need to be getting stuff together and heading <br/>\nout the door, not when we need to be leaving the driveway. We also <br/>\nassume that there&#39;ll be 10 minutes or so worth of stopping at <br/>\ntraffic lights, stop signs, slow drivers, etc so if it takes 20 <br/>\nminutes to drive somewhere, we leave 30 minutes beforehand and add <br/>\nanother 10 to 15 minutes to arrive early/on time. That way, if we <br/>\nare moving slowly or something happens last minute, we&#39;ve got <br/>\nleeway. We talk a lot the whole way through - &quot;I&#39;m going to get our <br/>\nshoes so we can be ready to leave in 10 minutes&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ll help you get <br/>\nyour shoes on since we&#39;re leaving in 5 minutes&quot;, &quot;Is there anything <br/>\nyou want to carry along now when we&#39;re leaving?&quot; Arranging things as <br/>\nmuch as possible such that departure coincides with the ending of 15 <br/>\nand 30 minute programming blocks (especially in the morning-DS likes <br/>\nto &#39;wake up&#39; to familiar TV programs before he really gets going) is <br/>\nhelpful - no need to tear anyone away from anything (and we&#39;re <br/>\nlooking into DVR so we can record stuff). DS often finds it helpful <br/>\nin making the transition from home to elsewhere by bringing <br/>\nsomething along - a toy, book, some little doodad of some form that <br/>\nis a &#39;piece of home&#39; to provide continuity in moving from one <br/>\nactivity/place/event to another. Something I&#39;ve found important for <br/>\nmyself is to shower, eat and get myself ready before even waking DS <br/>\n(assuming we&#39;re going somewhere first thing in the a.m. which is <br/>\npretty rare except for Sunday mornings). Once I have everything set, <br/>\nI can then focus 100% on DS getting ready and out the door and that <br/>\ncanmake a world of difference. DH goes into his own little <br/>\nintersecting orbit and gets himself ready and gets stuff out to the <br/>\nvehicle while I concentrate on DS. If it is just DS and DH (DH is <br/>\nthe at home parent) then (a) we try to avoid anything before 10 am <br/>\n(b) we prep DS the night before to know that in the morning x is <br/>\nhappening at y time (c) we talk about what to expect, what will <br/>\nhappen, what might happen, what could happen (d) we include him in <br/>\nthe planning for the morning - perhaps they stop for a donut on the <br/>\nway or they plan to get lunch afterward or the decide to go to the <br/>\npark or whatever - there have been times when DS has suggested <br/>\nstopping at the bookstore after an appointment - that&#39;s a relaxing <br/>\nthing for him (and we like it too - we all just take a deep, paper-<br/>\nand-print scented breath and relax as we walk in the door). Whatever <br/>\nit is, we try to work up a plan that fits as many needs/wants as <br/>\npossible. We also limit running around times so if there&#39;s a set <br/>\nappointment on Tuesday, there&#39;s nothing else planned for Tuesday <br/>\nexcept whatever free-form stuff gets added. We don&#39;t do back to back <br/>\nto back appointment running. I know that in some places, where you <br/>\nhave to drive an hour to anywhere, that&#39;s just not practical, but it <br/>\nworks for us. <br/>\n<br/>\nHTH<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143938653,"authorName":"K Krejci","from":"K Krejci &lt;kraekrej@...&gt;","profile":"kraekrej","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Breaking bonds","postDate":"1121838420","msgId":107375,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNzIwMDU0NzAwLjQ5ODQwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjU0MzAxLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQyRERFMDQyLjcwNDAzMDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":107373,"nextInTopic":107377,"prevInTime":107374,"nextInTime":107376,"topicId":107365,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I had always done attachment<br/>\nparenting, and it was such a break in our lives for him to go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why did I go through with it? I now think that it was because it<br/>\nmade me feel like I was more of a &quot;real grown-up&quot;, sending my kid to<br/>\nschool from 8:30 to 5 so that I could be at work (even though I wasn&#39;t<br/>\nat work, I was starting grad school.) But that last phrase shouldn&#39;t<br/>\neven be parenthetical, because that&#39;s the heart of the matter. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had always bought into school being preparation for real life,<br/>\ntherefore feeling that I wasn&#39;t really living my real life as long as<br/>\nI was in school. I got pregnant my last semester in college, and I<br/>\nmoved in with my parents right after Gabriel was born. I helped out in<br/>\ntheir bakery, so that I could be with Gabriel, and I never went out<br/>\nand got that &quot;first job out of college&quot;, thereby initiating me into<br/>\nwhat counts for &quot;real life&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen when he was three, I applied to and was accepted to graduate<br/>\nschool. But somehow, in my mind, being in grad school also did not<br/>\ncount as real life, and being a student again made me feel like I was<br/>\nnot an adult, although I had been raising my son on my own for four<br/>\nyears, and doing an okay job of it, I think. So I justified breaking<br/>\nbonds with Gabriel in order to make myself feel better and more grown up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you know, once they&#39;re in school, so many other things can creep<br/>\nin, bedtimes (because they have to get up early), and homework trying<br/>\nto make parents take sides with school against their kids, etc. etc.,<br/>\nwhich chips away at the parent-child relationship every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am just so thankful that we re-evaluated our lives, and our<br/>\nrelationships with our kids, and took Gabriel out of school and will<br/>\nnever send Raphael.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this post makes at least some sense, as I&#39;ve been interrupted<br/>\nmany many times by a one-year-old who&#39;s super excited about learning<br/>\nto walk...<br/>\n<br/>\nGwen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Breaking bonds","postDate":"1121818813","msgId":107370,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDhlMzcyODE5OGI1NGMwYzVlZjYyYjAwNDkxNmNiYjQwQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":107368,"nextInTopic":107372,"prevInTime":107369,"nextInTime":107371,"topicId":107365,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-661714568\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; At my school, the older kids stood by the fence and sang to the little<br/>\n<br/>\nkids -- &quot;Kindergarten baby, born in the gravy, belong in the navy,&quot; in <br/>\nsing-song voices.

It breaks bonds between siblings, and replaces them with prejudices about age and grade, with rules against playing with kids of other ages, and with social pressure to be hateful and secretive.&quot; --Sandra Dodd<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it reminded me of when my sister (who was a year and five days younger than me) had to play on the kindergarten playground, while I had to be on the playground for kids grades 1-3.  The playgrounds were literally divided by a big fence.  Recess was at the same time for the different grade levels, so my little sister came to the fence, crying hysterically, putting her arms through the holes to touch me.  I had to stand there and reassure her that we could be together after school and that everything would be okay.  A teacher came over and tried to convince her to leave the fence and to go play and have fun with the other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hadn&#39;t thought much about this as an adult until reading that quote.
