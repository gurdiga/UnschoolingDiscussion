If they don t want to go to ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1882948753\">Hi Joanne,<br/>\nI too have two shy daughters too.   Mine are 6 and 8 and  I follow their<br/>\nlead as to how much socialization they get.  If they don&#39;t want to go to<br/>\nsomething, we don&#39;t go.  At first I felt like we needed  more socialization<br/>\nbut on further reflection, I don&#39;t think we do. We are doing what makes us<br/>\ncomfortable and just because we are different than the majority of the<br/>\npopulation, there is nothing wrong with us that needs fixing.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy girls are best friends with each other and with my brother&#39;s kids, who<br/>\nare also homeschooled.  They also are great friends with another cousin who<br/>\nis in public school but unfortunately we don&#39;t see much of her with her busy<br/>\nschedule.  We have a few other friends/acquaintances who we visit sometimes,<br/>\nbut the kids just haven&#39;t hit it off.  We have all acknowledged that we<br/>\nwould like to have one other family that we really connect with and we are<br/>\ntrying to find that someone now, not because we should, but because we would<br/>\nlike to have someone else to play with and visit during the week.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy girls aren&#39;t comfortable in group situations at all.  It has gotten a<br/>\n*little* easier as they have gotten a little older, but they prefer, like<br/>\nme, to play or visit with one family at a time.  It took me awhile to feel<br/>\nok with this, mostly because other people put the pressure on us to be in a<br/>\ngroup.  As an adult, I prefer to have a couple close friends rather than a<br/>\nlarge group of acquaintances and that ok for my kids too.  I realize that<br/>\nsociety thinks socialization only happens in large groups, but it just isn&#39;t<br/>\ntrue.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen we do go to group events, my girls are often happy watching from the<br/>\nsidelines.  If your girls want more friends, I would ask someone from the<br/>\ngroup that you think might be a good fit over to your house so you can get<br/>\nto know them on a more personal level.  When I have done this I try to have<br/>\nan activity available so the kids can warm up to each other gradually, like<br/>\na painting or craft project or a walk to the neighbors farm.<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope this helps.  Keep in mind that if your kids went to public school,<br/>\nthey would most likely draw further into themselves, not turn into little<br/>\nextroverts.  <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela in <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Maine-unschooling@...\">Maine-unschooling@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://userpages.prexar.com/rickshaw/\">http://userpages.prexar.com/rickshaw/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What you are shouts so loudly in my ears I cannot hear what you say.&quot;<br/>\nEmerson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":102133373,"authorName":"joannec28804 &lt;joannec28804@yahoo.com&gt;","from":"&quot;joannec28804 &lt;joannec28804@...&gt;&quot; &lt;joannec28804@...&gt;","profile":"joannec28804","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"shy kids","postDate":"1045004118","msgId":58511,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGIyYnYwbis2NWg5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":58512,"prevInTime":58510,"nextInTime":58512,"topicId":58511,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, I ve been lurking on this list for awhile, absorbing new ideas and seeing some amazing changes within myself and my approach with my kids.

I always thought I was a pretty relaxed homeschooler, but now <br/>\nI see that I was relaxed as long as everyone was going along with MY <br/>\nagenda.  (So, not relaxed at all, really!)<br/>\nOne thing I&#39;ve been struggling with is how my daughters interact in <br/>\nsocial situations.  They are ages 8 and 11, both shy, and reluctant <br/>\nto try new things.  They have a few close friends, but these are <br/>\nmostly daughters of my friends, and not necessarily homeschoolers.  <br/>\nWhen we do go to a homeschool gathering, they often feel <br/>\nuncomfortable because they have trouble getting plugged into the <br/>\ngroup, and instead kind of hang around on the outskirts.  Then they <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to go back because they felt uncomfortable.<br/>\nI was really shy as a kid, and so seeing them go through it makes me <br/>\nwant to avoid the whole group thing, which of course isolates them <br/>\nfurther.<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;d like some feedback on how the philosophy of unschooling <br/>\nplays in with socialization issues.  How much do I push them to try <br/>\nnew things?  Do I let them set their own pace, even when they say <br/>\nthey want more friends but won&#39;t initiate anything?<br/>\nI don&#39;t encounter too many other shy kids, and really never see <br/>\nanything written about this in homeschool journals.  Anyone have any <br/>\nideas or experiences to share?<br/>\nThanks so much for all you do--you have really helped me to question <br/>\na lot of my parenting/homeschooling practices.<br/>\nJoanne</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"callingmoon","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: shy kids","postDate":"1042653618","msgId":58540,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWMyYmNjMCQwM2YzMTQ0MCQ3YzgwZWU0MEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwNDUwMTY3NTEuMTQ3MS4yMjY0NC5tN0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58528,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":58539,"nextInTime":58541,"topicId":58511,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Adriane (12) was painfully shy when she was little.
