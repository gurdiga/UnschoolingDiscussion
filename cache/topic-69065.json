I lost my first.  She was born 2 months early and then turned<br/>\nout to have a major heart defect.  She lived 7 1/2 months and died following<br/>\nheart surgery.  I didn&#39;t have another child to focus on.  What I did do was<br/>\nrush into a new marriage (the stress had finally kicked the previous one<br/>\nover the edge) and pregnancy.  While I always say that Heather was the best<br/>\nmistake I ever made, it can&#39;t have been easy for her and her brother growing<br/>\nup in and after that messed up marriage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt the same way you do about the things I learned and gained from having<br/>\nAriana for that short time.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary<br/>\nsaftety deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;  Ben Franklin<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8151304,"authorName":"rubyprincesstsg@aol.com","from":"rubyprincesstsg@...","profile":"rubyprincesstsg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] having kids...","postDate":"1052935547","msgId":69065,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5ZS4xNGFjZDc4NS4yYmYzZGY3YkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":69083,"prevInTime":69064,"nextInTime":69066,"topicId":69065,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/14/2003 1:57:18 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...
