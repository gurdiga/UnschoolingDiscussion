Math in real life is done much more intuitively.<br/>\nEducators need to break it down into memorizable steps because kids don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand the concepts. And since it&#39;s really tough to test for<br/>\nunderstanding, the educators rely on testing if someone can recall something<br/>\nthey&#39;ve memorized.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the conference I was (not very successfully since I need lots of time to<br/>\ngather my thoughts!) trying to explain how kids get arithmetic. I was<br/>\nexplaining the steps my daughter might use to add 2 largish numbers. It<br/>\nwould involve changing the numbers around to make them into numbers that are<br/>\neasy to manipulate in your head. But the man I was explaining it to pointed<br/>\nout that it was way more complex than learning to borrow and carry.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell it is if you were teaching it as a formula. But when it&#39;s done because<br/>\nsomeone understands how numbers work, it&#39;s very simple.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Why, when we are dividing fractions, do we flip the second one over and<br/>\n&gt; multiply?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s convention. It works out that way. ;-) And that&#39;s the problem with<br/>\nmemorizing procedures to spit back for a test.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it conceptually. If you take a whole (1) and divide it into<br/>\nlarger and larger numbers of pieces 1/2, 1/3, 1/27. 1/100, you get smaller<br/>\nand smaller pieces. If you divide a whole into 1 piece, you&#39;ll get 1 piece<br/>\n(1/1). If you divide a whole into smaller and smaller numbers of pieces<br/>\n(though the normal way of describing division doesn&#39;t work so well --<br/>\ndividing 1 into half a piece, or taking 1 piece out of 1/2 pieces doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmake much sense), the pieces should get larger and larger. In other words<br/>\nthey have to get bigger than one. So 1 divided by 1/2 is 2 (or 2/1 which is<br/>\n1/2 flipped over.) 1 divided by 1/6 should be 6, so 2 divided by 1/6 (<br/>\n2/(1/6) which is the same as 2x(6/1)) should be twice as much, so 12.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath needs to describe things that fall outside the realm of physical<br/>\nobjects. So though in some contexts it make sense to divide by numbers<br/>\nsmaller than 1, it doesn&#39;t make much sense to divide a plate of cookies by<br/>\n1/2 a child. ;-) But it might help make the concept clearer if you tried! If<br/>\nthere are 5 cookies to divide by 1/2 a child, how many cookies does a whole<br/>\nchild get? If there are 2 cookies to divide by 1/6 of a child, how many<br/>\ncookies does a whole child get? How many cookies would 3 children get?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] math","postDate":"1044620417","msgId":58201,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNjkwRUIxLjEzQTE1JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0Zi4xYjU2OTBhYS4yYjc0NzlkZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58200,"nextInTopic":58203,"prevInTime":58200,"nextInTime":58202,"topicId":3759,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You could read<br/>\nChinese without speaking it. In fact I&#39;m pretty sure the written Chinese can<br/>\nbe read regardless of the language one speaks. Here&#39;s something:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In China there are many different dialects. Dialects usually refer to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;regional forms of a language.&quot; However, many of the regional variants which<br/>\n&gt; are commonly referred to as &quot;dialects&quot; of the Chinese language are more<br/>\n&gt; different from one another than French is from Spanish or Norwegian is from<br/>\n&gt; Swedish! Below are some figures for different &quot;dialect groups&quot; in China:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dialect Group    Number of Speakers (approx.)<br/>\n&gt; Northern(Includes Mandarin)    387,000,000<br/>\n&gt; Jiangsu-Zhejiang    46,000,000<br/>\n&gt; Hunan    26,000,000<br/>\n&gt; Jiangsi    13,000,000<br/>\n&gt; Hakka    20,000,000<br/>\n&gt; Northern Min    7,000,000<br/>\n&gt; Southern Min    15,000,000<br/>\n&gt; Cantonese    27,000,000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One thing that makes the Chinese dialect situation unique -- that is different<br/>\n&gt; from the situation confronting speakers of French and Spanish or Norwegian and<br/>\n&gt; Swedish -- concerns the fact that all speakers who are literate share a common<br/>\n&gt; written language. Thus, while oral forms vary greatly, written symbols can be<br/>\n&gt; used to communicate effectively between speakers of different dialects.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which makes written Chinese like mathematical notation. As long as someone<br/>\nunderstands the concepts and knows how the concepts relate to the notation,<br/>\nthey can read Chinese (or math). But if somene is hazy on the concepts or<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t understand the relationship between the concepts and the notation<br/>\nthen the written language isn&#39;t going to mean much.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] math","postDate":"1044618461","msgId":58200,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNjkwNzBELjEzQTE0JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTIwMWMyY2U2ZiQyMGRmNDRmMCQ3YjdlNTI0NEBjZWxlcm9uMTc+"},"prevInTopic":58188,"nextInTopic":58201,"prevInTime":58199,"nextInTime":58201,"topicId":3759,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Some time after leaving school, he started a project all on his own<br/>\nof doubling numbers.  1+1+2, 2+2+4, etc.  When he finished the trillions, he<br/>\nhad to ask his mother what came next.  After the quadrillions, they had to<br/>\nlook up what came next.  He got bored with the project during the<br/>\nquintillions.

With math, as with writing or history or science or music <br/>\nor anything, either a kid sparks and GETS IT, in which case much of his <br/>\nlearning happens in his own head, or goofing with the ideas on his own, or <br/>\nlooking at other sources, or maybe the kid sparks because he already was a <br/>\nmathematical thinker; or the kid does NOT spark, just sits in a room where <br/>\nthe teacher is trying unsuccessfully to get the spark lit, suffers through <br/>\nhomework he doesn&#39;t understand, gets bad grades on tests he&#39;s not <br/>\nunderstanding, and comes out at the end of the year not knowing any more than <br/>\nhe knew before except that he hates math more (whatever &quot;math&quot; is to him).<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying, building, puzzle solving, video game playing, are all more real to <br/>\nmathematical thought and understanding than formulas in a textbook are.  <br/>\nThere are 100 level math courses at most colleges and ALL local/jr/commmunity <br/>\ncolleges.  There are computer games (algebra blasters) and there are internet <br/>\nreview sites.  There are laminated study-guides.  There are other humans to <br/>\nask questions of.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNobody, college bound or otherwise, has to take &quot;math classes&quot; in the classic <br/>\nsense.  If you and your kids want to know what kind of math is on the ACT or <br/>\nSAT, get sample tests, look at websites, buy (USED!) study guides for them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMuch of this worry, pressure and grief comes from the parents not being clear <br/>\non where math is in the real world, or not being aware that most kids who do <br/>\nwell in math in jr. high and high school already understood it and had an <br/>\ninterest before they got into the classroom, so for the best students, it&#39;s <br/>\njust naming ideas they already had and putting graphs and charts to things <br/>\nthey had instinctively figured out already without the formalities.<br/>\n<br/>\nMathematical notation is like musical notation, or like diagramming <br/>\nsentences.  Someone can be a great speaker and writer, a poet, and not know <br/>\nwhat a past participle is (and not NEED to know).  Someone can be a great <br/>\nmusician AND compser, a Paul McCartney, and not read music or know &quot;modes&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;subdominant chords&quot; (not by name).   Let your kids do math like <br/>\nmusicians play by ear or like writers write in ideas, not in sentence <br/>\nstructures.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF they love it and if they&#39;re good at seeing it, thinking it, using it, they <br/>\nmight (or might not ever) want to learn the written notation.  And if they <br/>\nunderstand it FIRST the written notation will never take them 180 days to <br/>\nlearn.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many people feel sure they are NOT musicians, and won&#39;t even pick up an <br/>\ninstrument, because of early failures to understand how to read musical <br/>\nnotation?
