Within the UK university system you<br/>\nsign up for a subject at the outset (which has a set curriculum in a<br/>\nset order, so you have to take psych 101 in your first year and psych<br/>\n201 in your second year with the third year being the only year (in<br/>\nPsych at Durham) that you can take optional psychology classes) and if<br/>\nyou change your mind you have to start from scratch again.  It is<br/>\nextremely difficult to take courses outside of your field. So, while<br/>\nyou are free to attend university because of the structure of the<br/>\neducation system you aren&#39;t free to choose what you study--and you<br/>\nhave to have decided want you want to take from a very early age in<br/>\norder to study for the right A levels. Also, David has to take<br/>\nattendance.  So, the students are risking their grades by not<br/>\nattending, or their ability to sue the University for a better grade. <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid or the secretaries are required to chase up work that is not<br/>\ndone, and to contact students who have poor attendance. Something that<br/>\nthe University requires.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, at the University of Durham at least, there are very, very few<br/>\nmature students.  It seems the Open University and ex-polytechnics are<br/>\npicking up the mature students more than established universities are.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the US you can take classes at University as the desire strikes. <br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to be enrolled in a degree program, you can just drop<br/>\nin and drop back out again.

That way, they are <br/>\nless inviting and if they get grabbed, they are together and less <br/>\nlikely to get lost or mutilated. If you only need a small pile at a <br/>\ntime, I might get some sort of file box (closeable type thing, even <br/>\na really big tupperware container or ziplock bag would do) and put <br/>\nstuff that isn&#39;t immediately needed in there - if DS gets at it, the <br/>\nstuff inside is still safe and orderly for the most part. Who cares <br/>\nif having a stack of ziplock bags full of papers looks a bit odd, if <br/>\nit works.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the jealousy here&#39;s one tidbit that seems to work with DS (I <br/>\nwork from home on occasion, DS is older but it might still work): <br/>\nwhen I work from home, I take 10-15 minutes from each hour and that <br/>\nis my &#39;break time&#39; - I get up and stretch, stop at the bathroom if <br/>\nneed be, get a glass of water, and most importantly, I give DS a <br/>\nchunk of that time to tell me what he&#39;s been doing, get him things <br/>\nhe&#39;s wanting and so on. By giving him Me in small bits throughout my <br/>\nworking time (and yes I know that adds length to the day to get the <br/>\nsame amount of work in) he is much more accepting of the time I am <br/>\nworking. You might also get an old keyboard by itself (I&#39;m sure if <br/>\nyou don&#39;t have one, you can ask around and find one or get a cheap <br/>\none from a computer refurbishing place) and when you start to work, <br/>\nput that out for DS so he is &#39;working&#39; like mommy. Other &#39;when <br/>\nmommy&#39;s working only&#39; toys and things might help as well - a special <br/>\nbasket of papers and blocks and whatnots that he likes that comes <br/>\nout when mom&#39;s working.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe DH needs specific ideas of what you are looking for when you <br/>\nwant his help. Instead of &quot;Please keep DS out of my papers&quot; <br/>\nsomething like &quot;DS likes playing with these blocks. Can you help him <br/>\nbuild some towers to knock down?&quot; Find things that he is comfortable <br/>\ndoing (so he&#39;s not necessarily having to go out of his comfort <br/>\narea). Or perhaps get a small TV/DVD player that he and DS can go <br/>\nwatch in the bedroom while you are working. They have wall mounting <br/>\ngear so it can go up safely out of reach and not require a flat <br/>\nsurface to sit on.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223965924,"authorName":"Andrea Roher","from":"Andrea Roher &lt;evenstar75@...&gt;","profile":"evenstar75","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Two Little Issues","postDate":"1138025521","msgId":111380,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcwZmQ4ZmJiMDYwMTIzMDYxMnYzZjRjZGQ5MG1jMjE3ODFjYjY4NTI0MjhlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":111385,"prevInTime":111379,"nextInTime":111381,"topicId":111380,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have two problems I m trying to solve for my son (19mo).

Babyproofing... we (dh, ds, and I) currently live with my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-342183244\">I have two problems I&#39;m trying to solve for my son (19mo).  They are<br/>\nbabyproofing and jealousy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBabyproofing... we (dh, ds, and I) currently live with my parents who<br/>\nare tolerant of the unschooling philosophy.  Their attitude is more or<br/>\nless, &quot;It&#39;s your kid, but it&#39;s not the way we&#39;d do it.&quot;  (Which is<br/>\nobvious when compared to the extremely &quot;sheltered&quot; upbringing I had.) <br/>\nBut we spend a good deal of time in our two rooms and most of it in<br/>\nthe one room we designated as office/living room (the other room is<br/>\nour bedroom).  We&#39;ve got the bedroom mostly babyproofed so ds is able<br/>\nto put himself to bed on a foam fold-out sofa we got for him.  The<br/>\nbedroom is basically babyproofed, meaning that there&#39;s not much he can<br/>\nget to that we want to keep him away from (except for the headboard of<br/>\nour bed, where we currently have some fragile valuables, and the<br/>\nattached bathroom) but the office/living room is another matter<br/>\nentirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nJealousy.. I work from home (in all about 36 to 40 hours a week). <br/>\nThis work is on my computer, which also happens to be my favorite way<br/>\nto relax.  I do my best to not &quot;play&quot; on my computer when ds is awake,<br/>\nbut even so ds is obviously, patently jealous of my computer and the<br/>\ntime I spend at it.  My husband attends college classes in the<br/>\nmorning, so I try to get ds out to the gym to swim each day (which he<br/>\nloves) so he&#39;ll take a good long nap and I can work without issues<br/>\nuntil dh gets home from school.  Ds normally wakes up about the time<br/>\ndh gets home (around noon).  That&#39;s when the problems start.  Dh tends<br/>\nto be a homebody, bordering on hermit.  He doesn&#39;t like to leave our<br/>\narea unless he has to.  But when he&#39;s in our area while I&#39;m working,<br/>\nds will often do things like pull my work papers off my desk, try to<br/>\nturn my chair around to face the other way, etc.  I haven&#39;t been able<br/>\nto find enough time in the day to spend all of ds&#39;s waking time<br/>\nfocused on him, get enough sleep myself, and still get enough work<br/>\ndone to keep the family afloat financially.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis ties back into the babyproofing issue as well.  I also have been<br/>\nunable to find a way to keep my important work stuff out of ds&#39;s reach<br/>\nso that he&#39;s not tempted.  We have such a limited space that just<br/>\nabout everything we have that&#39;s not in storage is fairly easily<br/>\navailable to ds.  We&#39;ve done the best we can and actually managed to<br/>\nuse the space better than I had hoped (two computers, two regular<br/>\nsized recliners, a child sized recliner for ds, a stack of two<br/>\nmini-fridges, a TV, a filing cabinet, and a dresser for ds, plus<br/>\nassorted storage locations in a 10x15 room).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, dh is only moderately tolerant of the unschooling philosophy. <br/>\nHis attitude is basically, &quot;I&#39;m okay with some of it, but my kids will<br/>\ndo chores and you&#39;re not allowed to help them with them.&quot;  (Though I<br/>\nexpect/hope that will change before ds is old enough for us to<br/>\nconsider giving him any chores, he has eased up slightly since I first<br/>\nbroached the topic.)  Therefore it&#39;s not as easy to get dh to help<br/>\nkeep ds out of everything (by redirection), because he tends to resort<br/>\nto a loud, angry &quot;no&quot; and a smack on the bottom when ds gets into<br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m looking for any ideas I can use to make life better for ds<br/>\nand move us a step closer to our goal of radical unschooling.  Also,<br/>\nif anyone knows of a good tips and strategies website for general<br/>\nbabyproofing that may just give me some new ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----<br/>\nAndrea L.
