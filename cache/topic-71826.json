My<br/>\nsister had the idea when she went for a visit of singing some of the songs<br/>\nwe all used to sing as a family, and it seemed to go over well.  I&#39;d like to<br/>\ndo the same, but for most songs I only remember the first few lines.  And<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing that looking over titles or first lines will remind me of other<br/>\nsongs I&#39;ve forgotten.  Anybody have favourite sites for finding folksong<br/>\nlyrics?  Sandra?
