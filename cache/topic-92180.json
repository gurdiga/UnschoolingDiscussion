I was in this Kinder Musik class with him.  We were all sitting <br/>\nin a circle and I think he was stuffing some instrument in his mouth.

After class <br/>\nthe instructor (who was also my friend) jumped all over me questioning how I <br/>\ncould ever say the word &quot;No&quot; to my poor child who obviously could now be <br/>\npsychologically damaged for the rest of his life.

Another friend I have told <br/>\nme that in her little preschool (she is unschooling now) that occasionally <br/>\nsaying the words &quot;good job&quot; to a child would result in the other mothers <br/>\ngiving her the evil eye.

(He&#39;s almost 4 now, and his<br/>\nsisters are 6 and 5.) Obviously, he was significantly older and more<br/>\ndevelopmentally capable of understanding boundaries at that point than a 18<br/>\nmo old. Sam&#39;s never been a distractable kind of child, but he will sometimes<br/>\ndeal with substitutions--you can&#39;t do it here, but you can do it over there<br/>\nkind of thing. He stayed with me while I cleaned up and helped when he could<br/>\n(this was when that was still interesting *g*) and we talked about how the<br/>\ncrayon makes it difficult to play on the computer, that mommy doesn&#39;t like<br/>\ncrayon on the walls, furniture or carpet but loves to tape pictures to the<br/>\nwall where ever they would like (tape is a really big thing around here<br/>\nright now). After the third or fourth time, I did simply tell the kids that<br/>\nif I wasn&#39;t there, the art supplies didn&#39;t come down. But, I made sure to<br/>\nsay &quot;yes&quot; when ever they asked for them, so they weren&#39;t cut off from doing<br/>\nart. That didn&#39;t last long, and when we &quot;tried again&quot; Sam was done with<br/>\ndrawing on things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a big fan of reducing the number of no&#39;s and the impact of accidents as<br/>\nmuch as possible: making sure that *everything* is washable at this age.<br/>\nSlipcovers, satin instead of flat wall paint (in the playroom I used<br/>\nsemi-gloss!), water-solulable art supplies. This makes it much easier not to<br/>\nget worked up over accidents and experiments. There are boundaries and kids<br/>\nwork to figure out what they are, but there&#39;s a big difference between<br/>\nfinding out a boundary in a punitive and shaming kind of way versus a gentle<br/>\nbut firm way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Julie that &quot;no&quot; is a part of living with other people. When I<br/>\nsay no, it&#39;s a &quot;no, thank you&quot; and an explanation why: &quot;No thank you jumping<br/>\non my bed. I&#39;m tired and trying to relax. If you want to jump, please get<br/>\ndown on the floor&quot;. If it&#39;s something big like hitting his sisters, me or<br/>\nthe dog it&#39;s a &quot;no, sir!&quot; firm but not yelled, furrowed brows to let him<br/>\nknow that I&#39;m serious about not allowing the action to continue, and the<br/>\nnext step is removing him from the situation--picking him up and walking<br/>\nwith him to his room, or to sit on the stairs, someplace where we&#39;re out of<br/>\nview from the others and can focus on each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n*sigh* Yes, all my examples of &quot;no&quot; and boundaries are about my guy, not my<br/>\ngirls--he&#39;s my challenge. The key as I see it is always being willing to<br/>\nexamine boundaries from several perspectives to see if they can be<br/>\nrenegotiated and as much as possible remaining gentle, firm and consistent<br/>\nwhen the boundaries really are inflexible, like hitting, ruining carpet and<br/>\nfurniture. Often there are ways around even the firm boundaries as people<br/>\nhave been pointing out: can&#39;t draw on furniture, but can paint a child&#39;s<br/>\ntable with chalkboard paint; can&#39;t draw on walls, but can draw on<br/>\npaper-covered walls or other designated spaces; can&#39;t carve furniture, but<br/>\ncan carve soap or erasers; can&#39;t hit people or animals, but can hit pillows;<br/>\ncan&#39;t spit at people, but can spit outside or in the shower. The real<br/>\nchallenge with my guy has been that he often wants nothing to do with these<br/>\nsubstitutions--it&#39;s the original action or a rage. That gets really tricky.<br/>\nThe key for me is to try to prevent situations whenever possible by being<br/>\nthere and immediately available, by trying to read his cues (because the<br/>\ncircumstances are unpredictable) before the situation escalates, and by<br/>\nreducing the number of no&#39;s to a bare minimum by really recognizing the<br/>\nknee-jerk, in-the-box kind of no&#39;s that pop out of some parent&#39;s mouths and<br/>\n*not* doing that myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162967824,"authorName":"Dawn Adams","from":"&quot;Dawn Adams&quot; &lt;Wishbone@...&gt;","profile":"bluenosegoddess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] The little problems with toddlers","postDate":"1080036980","msgId":92207,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTMwMWM0MTBiZiRlMzUxYmZjMCQ3OTRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM0MTA3OSRlNjJjZjYxMCQ2NzAxYThjMEBnZW5lcmljPg=="},"prevInTopic":92204,"nextInTopic":92208,"prevInTime":92206,"nextInTime":92208,"topicId":92180,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Genevieve writes: One of my babies is a real wall-art artist.

It is a perfectly wonderful word when it<br/>\nisn&#39;t overused.  It lets others know where our boundaries are.  If we never<br/>\nuse the word &quot;no&quot;, we can use so many other words that kids end up not<br/>\nknowing where that line is.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  My 7yo dd likes to play with her friend in the friend&#39;s family car<br/>\nat park day.  The dad never said a word about it.  Then one day, the friend<br/>\nkept cutting her eyes at the dad and making like end runs around him to get<br/>\nto the car....taking my dd in tow.  It was obvious to me the Dad didn&#39;t want<br/>\nthem in the car.  I asked and he stated that papers had come up missing and<br/>\nit was a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told dd that Dad didn&#39;t want her playing in the car but friend kept trying<br/>\nto talk her into it, saying it was &#39;OK&#39;.  So I asked dd to ask Dad if he<br/>\nwanted her playing in the car.....he hemhawed around and finally said &quot;It<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be my preference.&quot;  I looked at Marsie and said &quot;That means &#39;no&#39;&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the problem comes when NO is the automatic answer, not because there<br/>\nis a real reason but because it is a knee-jerk reaction.  My right to do as<br/>\nI please stops at the point it infringes on your rights.  How will I know<br/>\nwhere that point is unless you tell me, particularly if I am 18 months old?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr it is a problem when people think that they have said &quot;no&quot; and the issue<br/>\nhas come up again so they must now punish the child to make them learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, try to find a solution that you are both happy with.  Of course,<br/>\ntry to help your daughter come up with other options.  But &quot;no&quot; is an<br/>\nacceptable word.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Brian and Kathy Stamp&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstamp@...\">bstamp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 22, 2004 4:07 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] The little problems with toddlers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I keep so much paper, in many different forms, around to draw on that<br/>\nthere should be no reason to actively search out wall-space.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We are talking about an 18 month old.lol.

When my kids<br/>\nwere interested in that we found ways for them to draw on the wall -<br/>\nchalkboard paint was a favorite, or hanging a thin piece of paper so<br/>\nthey could still feel the wall texture underneath, or picking a space<br/>\nfor them to decorate.  We got some really huge paper for them.  When<br/>\nRowan decided the couch was her favorite thing to draw on I gave her<br/>\nlots of different textured fabrics she could use.     <br/>\n <br/>\nMostly I just tried to keep in mind that their explorations were more<br/>\nvaluable than our furniture.
