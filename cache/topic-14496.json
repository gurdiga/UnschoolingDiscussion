The<br/>\n&gt; device would be electronically linked to the national DNA database,<br/>\n&gt; which Tony Blair has hailed as an essential tool in the fight against<br/>\n&gt; crime.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Forensic Science Service will disclose to Parliament this week that<br/>\n&gt; the equipment could be ready for standard use within a couple of years.<br/>\n&gt; The testing kit, which could become as common as the breathalyser or<br/>\n&gt; police baton, will dramatically cut the time it takes to match DNA<br/>\n&gt; evidence from crime scenes to suspects. It will raise fresh fears among<br/>\n&gt; civil liberties campaigners who believe that the pendulum has swung too<br/>\n&gt; far in the police&#39;s direction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Forensic scientists already expect that soon they will be able to use a<br/>\n&gt; single hair sample to discover a suspect&#39;s eye colour, facial<br/>\n&gt; characteristics, height and weight. They say that the next step will be<br/>\n&gt; portable testing kits that need little technical ability to operate. The<br/>\n&gt; FSS will give evidence to the House of Lords science and technology<br/>\n&gt; committee this week, telling peers that research on the kits is well<br/>\n&gt; advanced.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It currently takes at least 48 hours to profile biological material<br/>\n&gt; collected from a crime scene, but the new kits could give police an<br/>\n&gt; instant lead if they were made standard issue. They would allow such<br/>\n&gt; tests to be carried out outside the laboratory for the first time. A<br/>\n&gt; spokesman for the FSS, which is a Government agency, said: &quot;We feel that<br/>\n&gt; we have gone as far down the line as we can in terms of what a DNA<br/>\n&gt; profile can tell us about an individual and the next area we are looking<br/>\n&gt; at is speeding up the process.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Telegraph has seen written evidence to the Lords committee from one<br/>\n&gt; of the organisation&#39;s chief scientists, Dr Bob Bramley, and research<br/>\n&gt; documents. The committee began its inquiry after becoming concerned<br/>\n&gt; about the dramatic increase in the scale of DNA samples collected by the<br/>\n&gt; police.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Earlier this year, the Prime Minister announced an extra Â£109 million<br/>\n&gt; for the expansion of the police&#39;s DNA database in Birmingham to include<br/>\n&gt; samples from &quot;the entire active criminal population&quot; - estimated to be<br/>\n&gt; around three million.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The police have already collected nearly a million samples from those<br/>\n&gt; convicted of an offence that carries a prison sentence. Senior officers<br/>\n&gt; are now lobbying for changes in the law to allow further expansion of<br/>\n&gt; the database to include innocent people who volunteer to take part in<br/>\n&gt; mass screenings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Civil liberties campaigners are opposing any extension of the police&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; authority to to collect samples. They cite an official report which<br/>\n&gt; found that thousands of samples are being illegally held on the database<br/>\n&gt; because forces are failing to remove the records of acquitted suspects.<br/>\n&gt; John Wadham, the director of the human rights group Liberty, said: &quot;The<br/>\n&gt; law already allows the unjustified collection of samples and we know<br/>\n&gt; that there are at least 50,000 being illegally held at the FSS database.<br/>\n&gt; This is not the time to relax the law.&quot; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14481,"nextTopicId":14445}}
