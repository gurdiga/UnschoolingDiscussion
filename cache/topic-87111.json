I moved mine out a few days ago onto the deck (small house means I take it down as soon as possible). This morning I remembered something I&#39;d heard, lord knows where, a few years ago. It was still in the stand so the kids and I collected big pinecones from the neighbour&#39;s lawn (we have great neighbours), tied ribbons on them to hang, smeared them with peanut butter and rolled them in birdseed. Then we hung them on the tree. Hopefully we&#39;ll be able to watch birds in a few days.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87091,"nextTopicId":87117}}
