You see, I think that the most important thing <br/>\nthey can<br/>\n learn is that they are loved and worthy of being loved.

And that applies even if<br/>\n your child is virtually non-functioning, brain-damaged whatever. They need to<br/>\n learn that they are loved. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you hit the nail on the head.  I kind of ran headfirst into this one, <br/>\nbecause my second child has some fairly significant neurological damage.  He <br/>\nis just learning to walk at nearly four, and speaks only a few barely <br/>\nrecogizable words.  I originally tried going to the local early intervention <br/>\nprogram with him, but just came out nauseated by constant testing and <br/>\ncomparing and the complete lack of actually paying attention to the child at <br/>\nhand.  They are constantly trying to teach these babies things they are <br/>\nnowhere near interested in yet and in which the kids are completely passive <br/>\nparticipants.  But they always exclaimed when Gordon finally got to something <br/>\nabout the dedication and enthusiasm with which he pursued it.  (Basically <br/>\njust normal baby &quot;time to work on this&quot; monomania.)  They kept telling me <br/>\nthese children were completely incapable of learning anything on their own <br/>\nmotivation, which is why they had to step in and push on skill p, even though <br/>\nthe child showed no interest in doing anything except working on skill h, and <br/>\nhadn&#39;t any of the precursors to skill p.  They tried to get Gordon walking <br/>\nbefore he could crawl though he showed an interest in crawling and collapsed <br/>\nin a heap about walking.  This, in the name of &quot;catching up&quot;.  <br/>\n    So I blithely got into unschooling with kid 1, who began reading the <br/>\nnewspaper over my shoulder at 3, figuring that if no one learned anything for <br/>\na few years life would still be great.  And now I am biting my nails <br/>\nunschooling with kid 2 hoping it works out keeping him far from this system <br/>\nthat wants him to do everything but what he can.  I want him to keep his <br/>\nmotivation, his sense of success, his job as the active instigator and not <br/>\nthe passive follower.  I want him to be able to be himself without any sense <br/>\nthat he was supposed to be something else.  There are machines that will read <br/>\nto you these days, (once Mom&#39;s gone on her way).
