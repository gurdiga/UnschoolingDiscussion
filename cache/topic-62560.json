At the same time though, I <br/>\ndid have a very healthy diet growing up, we grew a lot of our own <br/>\nproduce and my mom belonged to a food co-op. For that aspect, I&#39;m <br/>\ngrateful. But I think most of our parents, particularly mothers, <br/>\nwere part of that 60&#39;s era thinking about women&#39;s bodies.

Again, anyone else dealing with this type of stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>First of all, stop beating yourself up over it. Embrace what is <br/>\nhappening at this moment and give yourself the opportunity to accept <br/>\nit. And I don&#39;t particularly think you caused this in your son. I <br/>\nthink humans are more or less programmed to crave sweet and fatty <br/>\nfoods. There was a time not too long ago in our biological heritage <br/>\nwhen this trait served us well. It allowed our bodies to stock up in <br/>\ntimes of plenty to prepare for times of famine. Of course, our <br/>\nbodies were also working all day back then, so it didn&#39;t have the <br/>\nassociated health problems it does now. There are many paths to get <br/>\npast this and get to a place where your body can recognize true <br/>\nhunger and desire for food. Several posts have talked about ways to <br/>\nlet go and give yourself permission to find out what foods you are <br/>\nreally craving. I came at it from a different place, but it worked <br/>\nwell for me so I&#39;ll share it as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went through a lot of the same stuff others have - food control as <br/>\na child, thinking I was fat, anorexia, followed by overeating, <br/>\nfollowed by control, etc. What helped me was to exercise. I found <br/>\nthat when I started making my body move - at first just gently a few <br/>\ntimes a week, but then increasing over time - I somehow cued in to <br/>\nmy body&#39;s actual signals: when it is really tired, feeling good, <br/>\ntense, relaxed, hungry, satiated, etc. As I exercised more, I also <br/>\nlost the guilt over eating, because my body needed more fuel. At the <br/>\nsame time, I cued in to cravings for good foods to fuel it. I <br/>\nrealized that for my body, eating meat made me feel lethargic, so I <br/>\ngave it up. I realized that whole grains and fruits and veggies made <br/>\nit feel good. But I also allowed myself to eat things like chocolate <br/>\nwithout the guilt. Surprisingly (to me), I have eaten less and less <br/>\nof it over time. I&#39;ve also found out what amount makes me still feel <br/>\nfine, and what amount makes me feel miserable. In our house, we <br/>\nalways have a variety of foods, including some chocolate at all <br/>\ntimes! In that book I talked about earlier, it mentioned that <br/>\nchocolate (particularly cocoa or dark chocolate) is higher in <br/>\nantioxidants than any fruit or veggie. No wonder we crave it! The <br/>\nwoman who was the oldest living person in the world for some time, <br/>\nshe died at 124 I think, said she ate chocolate and drank some wine <br/>\nevery day. Sounds like a good plan to me :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Goodness this is getting long. Sorry about that. Last issue!<br/>\n&gt; Bedtime.

If not, my son often goes off to play while I&#39;m spending some <br/>\nsnuggle time with her. Or he might go cuddle or wrestle or read with <br/>\nDH. Or, on a night he&#39;s feeling tired and my daughter isn&#39;t, she <br/>\nmight head off and I&#39;ll cuddle with him. Both of the kids really <br/>\nlook forward to their individual snuggle time with me where we talk <br/>\nabout our day and just hang out together. Sometimes they&#39;re both <br/>\ntired and we all snuggle up together. Sometimes one will fall asleep <br/>\nwatching a movie or whatever. The nice thing is that they&#39;re each <br/>\ncued in to their own bodies, so they recognize when they&#39;re getting <br/>\ntired and when they&#39;re not. They will come to me and tell me when <br/>\nthey&#39;re sleepy, and they&#39;ll let me know if they&#39;re not and they want <br/>\nto play or do something else. Regardless, the whole scenario usually <br/>\ntakes less than an hour, since it&#39;s begun when they know they&#39;re <br/>\nstarting to get sleepy. It&#39;s much less time than people I know go <br/>\nthrough who put their kids to bed at arbitrary times and then have <br/>\nto keep getting glasses of water and putting the kids back into bed <br/>\nand getting more and more frustrated all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nChances are, it might take awhile for your son to learn his own <br/>\nsleepy cues. At first, if you take away bedtime, he&#39;ll go through a <br/>\nlearning curve where he stays up, gets overtired, or goes to bed too <br/>\nearly and isn&#39;t tired yet. He&#39;ll learn through trial and error what <br/>\nit feels like to hear his body&#39;s signals that he&#39;s tired. A lot of <br/>\nus didn&#39;t go through that until we were in college. Eventually, <br/>\nhe&#39;ll figure out what works for him. In the meantime, get a stack of <br/>\ngood books for yourself (the time I&#39;m snuggled with my kids while <br/>\nthey&#39;re drifting off is always bonus reading time for me!) and that <br/>\nway you won&#39;t be tempted to view it as &quot;wasted time&quot;. You might find <br/>\na good way that the two of you can come to closure on the day. When <br/>\nwe climb into bed, I always talk about our day with each of the <br/>\nkids. It gives them an opportunity to tell me about whatever they <br/>\nwant to, and has opened up some very interesting revelations and <br/>\nconversations. After that, I usually sing to them, and then I read <br/>\nmy book as they drift off. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I get to the point where i am <br/>\n&gt; so tired that I don&#39;t want anyone to talk to me, what do I do with <br/>\n&gt; my  son then? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just tell him that it&#39;s quiet time for you, but you&#39;re still willing <br/>\nto be with him. Learn to recognize when you&#39;re approaching that <br/>\npoint, and offer to do any reading/talking/singing before that <br/>\npoint. I always read the bedtime stories before I start getting <br/>\nreally tired, and then after that I&#39;m done reading out loud or I <br/>\ntend to doze off in the middle of stories. After that, the kids can <br/>\nget up and play on their own or together, or they can lie down and <br/>\nsnuggle, but they know I&#39;m personally done being a part of any <br/>\naction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; other people have experienced on this issue.

Figure out how we are all feeling.   Work together.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If I&#39;m tired I communicate with the kids that I&#39;m running out of steam.

My 10 and 8 could go to bed on their own,  but they still like to be with me and my dh.  So I&#39;ll let them know that I&#39;m getting ready for bed,  ask them how they are doing.   Usually,  they are getting sleepy too and we all go to bed together,  between 9 and 10 p.m.,  I tend to get up early,  they sleep in.    This has been working quite well.   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe part that has been huge for me in this scenerio is that they are only young for such a short time.   I used to get so wrapped up with how tired I was.   I now can talk myself through it.   Work through the tiredness.    I was never cuddled or babied at night, so I try and do that now with my kids.   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you get breaks from your kids at other times of the day?   That&#39;s what helped with me.    I need to take some time for me,  reading, working at the computer,  whateever.   Then I can be there for them when they really need me,  and it seems to be more in the evening that they do need me.   I can then be patient, calm and end their day that way.    That nice feeling before going to bed,  instead of a sad, tense time.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelli<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I had been on many diets also by that age.  Didn&#39;t know there was anything but diet soda!  Sad, huh?<br/>\n <br/>\nMy advise:   very similar to Heidi&#39;s and Shyrley&#39;s.       Care for yourself and for sure,  stop Dieting!<br/>\n <br/>\nI started noticing that when I dieted I gained weight.   I stopped drinking diet soda,  drank water and lost weight.  I started eating what I wanted and lost weight.     It all has to do with listening to your body,  like what Heidi was talking about.<br/>\n <br/>\nI went through a Coke and chocolate phase,  seriously that&#39;s all I ate.  Not healthy and I&#39;m not saying you should do it,  but it was a discovery thing.   Growing up, I never was allowed dessert unless I ate everything,  surprise, surprise.     So, I was always wanting those desserts.        I had to figure out that it is only food,  not bad,  not good.   I can have it if I want it.    I think that&#39;s what took the fascination away,   I can have it if I want it.   Well,,,,,then I don&#39;t really want it.   Its not so magical then is it?<br/>\n <br/>\nI still sometimes eat chocolate and sometimes eat too much,  but its my choice and I weigh less than I used to and I&#39;m much healthier.      I don&#39;t hear my Mom anymore saying,  &quot;ooohhh,  you shouldn&#39;t be eating that!&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nKelli<br/>\n <br/>\nOh,  and I don&#39;t own a scale either!    I had to get over the whole number thing,  that was huge.   I&#39;m very large boned and tall,  so I was always trying to weigh alot less than what was healthy for me.   I&#39;m about  5&#39; 10&quot; and weigh around 160,  sometimes more, sometimes less.     Which is alot for some women,   but I know that I&#39;m fine and healthy!<br/>\n <br/>\nKelli<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n    <br/>\n Yahoo!

I gave myself permission to eat what and when I liked. For the first month or so I ate nothing but choclate and cookies. My body craved those things I had been<br/>\ndenying myself. It was hard and I was afraid it would never stop and that I would turn into a whale. Gradually the craving changed to bananas. Basically, over the first 6 months it was weird, I craved<br/>\nall sorts  of things. I also felt guilty (having a diet obsessed MIL doesn&#39;t help. I banned her from my life as a negative thing but thats a whole nother story - she thought anorexia was great cos it<br/>\nmade you thin!)<br/>\nI also learned to appreciate that my body was the way it was. I took it for walks, strated bike-riding.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not easy letting go of all that guilt, control etc and for a while you might feel that it means you get out of control but gradually everything balances back. It could take a year or so before it<br/>\ndoes which is why many people give up. They want an instant fix but years of controlling and years of a bad relationship with food doesn&#39;t disappear over-night unfortunately.<br/>\nI also found a good councellor (sp?) helped. She talked me through the issues with my mother until I could say no to that internal voice of my mothers telling me I wasn&#39;t good enough, that nothing I did<br/>\nwas ever right.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, hope that gave you some starting points.

I am digesting everything I <br/>\nhave been reading since I joined this list. Trying to let go of <br/>\ncontrol is something I struggle with. I truly believe in letting my <br/>\nchildren have free reign with the TV. I truly believe in giving them <br/>\nthe control over themselves, choices, and respect. <br/>\nI have come to the conclusion that I am the onew with the problems, I <br/>\nwas strictly controlled as a child, very little tv, told how fat I <br/>\nwas,(funny, don&#39;t look fat in pictures, that is another story.)My <br/>\nfood intake was strictly controlled, grapefruit and eggs diet at the <br/>\nage of 9, things like that. I hear the voices of my childhood <br/>\neverytime the tv comes on, and I am the one who sits vacantly in <br/>\nfront of it when it is on, so there is much guilt. I am trying to rid <br/>\nmyself of that. But I think it has certainly affected the way I <br/>\nparent.How do I let go off this for my children if I am still <br/>\npunishing myself?? I enjoyed what Sandra wrote about the inner child <br/>\nbut am not sure how to implement that. Anyone else dealing with this? <br/>\nAnd the eating thing is overwhelming. I am definitely a compulsive <br/>\novereater, and am not sure how to handle the free reign with food <br/>\nissue for my son. He seems to have the same food issues that I had, <br/>\nnot able to leave chocolate alone, must eat any cake or cookies in <br/>\nthe house voraciously till they are gone, I know I have caused these <br/>\nthings, but how do I help him and trust him when I can&#39;t trust <br/>\nmyself? Again, anyone else dealing with this type of stuff?<br/>\nGoodness this is getting long. Sorry about that. Last issue!<br/>\nBedtime. I was e-mailing with Sandra about this not long ago. I want <br/>\nto let of controlling my son&#39;s bedtime. I don&#39;t know what is holding <br/>\nme back. I seem to believe that I deserve the last hour or two of the <br/>\nnight to myself. My husband works afternoon shift all the time, so <br/>\nevenings are just me and the kids. would it be less stressful for me <br/>\nto just let it go rather than go thru the wholebed time routine? What <br/>\ndoes that look like for other people? I get to the point where i am <br/>\nso tired that I don&#39;t want anyone to talk to me, what do I do with <br/>\nmy  son then? this is not a vent. I really want to find out what <br/>\nother people have experienced on this issue. I am trying to work for <br/>\nchanges in my mindset to better things for my children.<br/>\nNancy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":50009731,"authorName":"Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema","from":"Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema &lt;heidi@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"DeFooding (was Plug in Drug Conversation)","postDate":"1049106366","msgId":62566,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwMzAzMzEwMTE5MzcuMDBiYzZiZjBAbWFpbC5keWtlbWEubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGI2YmQ3citwN2lwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62560,"nextInTopic":62570,"prevInTime":62565,"nextInTime":62567,"topicId":62560,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Again, anyone else dealing with this type of stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Nancy,<br/>\nI hope other folks speak to the tv and bedtime things, because I&#39;m going to <br/>\nthink about the food one for a minute.<br/>\nI know where you&#39;re coming from.  IMHO, you have to handle your perception <br/>\nof over-eating for yourself before you can handle it for your son... or <br/>\nmaybe the two of you can work on it together, if he&#39;s game.  I used to eat <br/>\nas a form of comfort - still do, but less frequently find the need and not <br/>\nto the extent I once did.  Bag of chips?  Used to be gone in 15 <br/>\nminutes.  Nowadays, a bag of chips lasts days or weeks (and sometimes gets <br/>\nthrown out because it&#39;s gone all stale!)<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, you gotta love you.  I know, can the crap already.  We&#39;re going to <br/>\ndo a self check.  Who are you?  You are not your mother. (surprise, <br/>\nsurprise!)  You are not whatever idea your mother had inside her pretty <br/>\nlittle 1950&#39;s era head. You are whatever YOU decide you are at that <br/>\nparticular moment in time and if you find yourself not being what you would <br/>\nlike to be, decide to be something else *for that ONE Particular Moment in <br/>\nTime.*   Seriously, break your life down into tiny little fragments and <br/>\ncatch yourself being who you want to be.  Were you &#39;yourself&#39; for the past <br/>\n2 minutes?  Hey, that&#39;s Great!  Now try for 3 minutes.  (seriously small <br/>\nfragments of time!)  Get to really enjoy one specific thing about yourself <br/>\neach day and concentrate on that one thing.  It can be your exquisite <br/>\nlittle toe or the way you cross your t&#39;s, singing off-key in the most <br/>\natrocious manner.  Choose something you enjoy about yourself.  Be you and <br/>\nrecognize you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so the underlying guilt and other assorted <br/>\nnot-meeting-up-to-mommy&#39;s-expectations complexes will take some time to get <br/>\nthrough.  In the meantime, let&#39;s play with the food.  You&#39;re going to <br/>\ndeschool eating... or is it, defood?  C&#39;mon, defooding is FUN! (and tasty!)<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, there is no such thing as &#39;bad&#39; food. (Unless you&#39;re allergic, <br/>\nperhaps.)  All food is good.  All food is good for you, if it fills a need <br/>\nfor you, and until you decide that it is not filling the need and something <br/>\nelse might fill it better... but you can&#39;t decide that yet, because you&#39;re <br/>\nstill seeing yourself being &#39;voracious&#39; about certain foods.  So, for now, <br/>\nbuy more of those foods so you will *never* run out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m serious.  If your body cries out for cookies, buy 10 bags of <br/>\ncookies.  Bake cookies until they overflow from your counter, until you <br/>\nhave to step around the containers of cookies to make dinner - or have <br/>\ncookies for dinner!  Make cakes with extra icing (excellent on spoons!) <br/>\nKeep a HEAPING bowl of chocolate M&M&#39;s on the kitchen table.  Put them in <br/>\npretty bowls and cookie jars.  Eat them.  Enjoy them. Decorate with <br/>\nthem!  Revel in them!  Look at the guilt then toss it over your <br/>\nshoulder!!!  There is NO guilt in eating what fills you.  There is NO such <br/>\nthing as a &#39;bad&#39; food!  If you want a food, it should be available to <br/>\nyou!  (after all, would you limit your accessibility to books?  Of course <br/>\nnot!)  And be in the moment, as much as you can.  Don&#39;t think about the <br/>\n&#39;next step&#39; or wonder how in the world you are eating this particular food, <br/>\njust eat it, and enjoy it!  Smack your lips!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a whiz-banger!  If you are NOT enjoying the food you are eating, <br/>\nSTOP eating it, and figure out what you *would* enjoy!  A different <br/>\nfood?  Something else?  Just never, ever &#39;punish&#39; yourself when you are <br/>\neating, and especially not afterwards.  Food is Good.  Think Good, Tasty <br/>\nFood, Tasty Chocolate, Tasty Cookies!  Good for You!  (and until you&#39;re <br/>\nsolid in enjoying and welcoming your food, NEVER eat with someone who beats <br/>\nthemselves up for eating.  Ever.  You are worth more than that!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAllow yourself to be filled by what calls to you.  When you have eaten what <br/>\nyou want, when you want, as much as you want for several weeks/months, <br/>\nbegin to pay closer attention to when you are full and to what kind of food <br/>\nyour body is asking for *at that moment*, but never limit yourself to <br/>\nquantity or content.  All food is Good!  All I mean is that before taking <br/>\nthe next bite, ask, Do I crave this morsel?  If so, Eat it!  If not, put it <br/>\nnearby, in case you change your mind and want it again.  Maybe you crave a <br/>\ndifferent morsel and should eat that!  You&#39;re de-fooding.  Everything is <br/>\nokay.<br/>\n<br/>\nEat the things you crave now, until you begin to crave something other than <br/>\ncookies, cake and chocolate, say, some sweet grapes.  (You don&#39;t crave them <br/>\nyet?  Then don&#39;t eat them!)  When you DO want the grapes (or whatever) go <br/>\nout immediately and buy the most luscious grapes you can find - and then <br/>\nbuy some beautiful M&M&#39;s and cookies too!  Put them together on the same <br/>\nkitchen counter, all displayed as nicely as can be.  When you are hungry, <br/>\nstand for a moment and think, What Calls To Me Most?  If it is the cookies, <br/>\nEat them!  If it is the grapes, Eat them!  If it is the M&M&#39;s, Eat <br/>\nthem!  If it is some of each, Eat them!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may take days.  It may take weeks, months, or even years (if you&#39;re <br/>\nstubborn about keeping the guilt thing, anyway) but one day you&#39;ll wake up <br/>\nand you won&#39;t be interested in bingeing on your chocolates.  You&#39;ll <br/>\nsurprise yourself by throwing out old, stale candy - by even HAVING stale <br/>\ncandy!  (believe me, I was surprised the first time!)  You may never be the <br/>\nbiggest fruit-eater on the block, but who cares?  We can&#39;t ALL be the <br/>\nbiggest fruit eaters - there wouldn&#39;t be enough fruit!  Instead, you&#39;ll be <br/>\nlistening to your body and giving it what it needs and wants, <br/>\nwholeheartedly and WITHOUT the blasted guilt thing pushing it in random <br/>\ndirections.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you&#39;re working on is giving yourself a chance to really experience <br/>\nwhat you&#39;ve always thought you shouldn&#39;t have but wanted, which will <br/>\nsomeday allow you to see if it&#39;s *really* deep-down what truly calls to <br/>\nyou, and by that time, you&#39;ll be so bored by the cookies, cakes and <br/>\nchocolates that they&#39;re just not interesting anymore.  Other foods will <br/>\nbecome more interesting... or maybe even other activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally.<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays, broccoli and asparagus are some of my favorite foods.  I <br/>\nfrequently prefer to eat them rather than chocolate, although we keep cases <br/>\nof chocolate in the house in case anyone ever wants some.  We&#39;re never <br/>\nwithout, just as we&#39;re never without cheese and turkey lunchmeat... and <br/>\nfrequently we go days or weeks without touching them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBon Appetit!<br/>\nHeidiWD<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I prefer a person who will burn the flag and wrap themselves in the <br/>\nconstitution to a person who will burn the constitution and wrap themselves <br/>\nin the flag&quot; --- Molly Ivins</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62925,"nextTopicId":62964}}
