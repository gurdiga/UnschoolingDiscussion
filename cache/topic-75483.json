He says it took him about 5 minutes to play ten <br/>\nversus matches, so he figures it&#39;ll take him less than an hour.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    He&#39;s keeping track of how many matches he&#39;s played, by occasionally <br/>\nadding the number of lost matches, and won matches.  He says he&#39;s won most of them, <br/>\nso it&#39;s really easy to add them up, but that he&#39;s going to finish all 100.   <br/>\nHe said he hopes he wins a good 90% of them.  I didn&#39;t know he knew what <br/>\npercentages were.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    Multiplication, adding, and percentages, from a video game. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Aimee</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75227,"nextTopicId":75484}}
