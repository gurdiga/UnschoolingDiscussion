Some <br/>\nparticipants questioned the ability of school principals to objectively <br/>\nevaluate teachers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to former Education Minister Hirofumi Nakasone, who is the <br/>\nprime minister&#39;s aide in charge of educational reform, seven panel <br/>\nmembers attended the forum, including Keita Asari, head of the Gekidan <br/>\nShiki theatrical company, and writer Ayako Sono.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 330 members of the public listened to the debate between the <br/>\ncommission members and the public representatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the eight members of the public, five mentioned the proposal in the <br/>\ninterim report that community work be made compulsory for students.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll five called for a cautionary approach to the proposal, but agreed <br/>\nthat community work is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nA 42-year-old company president, speaking on behalf of students&#39; parents, <br/>\nsaid, &quot;It is more effective to nurture a sense of cooperation among <br/>\nvolunteers in times of trouble, as was evident in the volunteer work that <br/>\nbegan after the [1995] Great Hanshin Earthquake.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA 57-year-old middle school principal stressed the importance of <br/>\nstudents&#39; independence, saying, &quot;Students gain self-confidence through <br/>\nthe experience of helping others if their independence is respected.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn response, Sono asked participants to show understanding for the report <br/>\nand said, &quot;If we first give students the opportunity to experience <br/>\ncommunity work, they will come to enjoy it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of the participants drawn from the public had experience as <br/>\nschoolteachers, and they expressed their opinions specifically on the <br/>\nissue of improving the teaching skills of teachers.<br/>\n<br/>\nA 43-year-old high school teacher spoke in favor of a proposal in the <br/>\nreport calling for the introduction of a merit-based evaluation system <br/>\nfor teachers.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think an evaluation system is needed in which teachers who strive hard <br/>\nare rewarded,&quot; the teacher said.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, another panelist questioned the evaluation ability of the <br/>\nadministration side, saying, &quot;I wonder if school administrators, <br/>\nincluding principals, are able to evaluate teachers objectively.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were some reactions to the proposal that teachers who have led <br/>\nclasses without difficulty or devised effective teaching methods be given <br/>\nspecial financial allowances.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCopyright 2000 The Yomiuri Shimbun</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13668,"nextTopicId":13676}}
