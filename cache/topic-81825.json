They desire the best for their children. It&#39;s simply that they have not <br/>\ntested the educational philosophy against the Scriptures. In the same manner <br/>\nthat on first glimpse, we may rationalize and justify the secular world&#39;s push <br/>\ntoward natural-consequence discipline or (non)submission to authority, so do <br/>\nmany Christians become sucked into the philosophy of unschooling. Each of these <br/>\nbears a closer look at God&#39;s Word, testing to see if they are true (they are <br/>\nnot). Can one be a Christian and unschool? Certainly. Just as one can be a <br/>\nChristian who disregards other commands of the Lord. But you cannot provide both a <br/>\nChristian education and an unschooling education simultaneously. They are <br/>\nmutually exclusive.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Why does it matter if a Christian calls himself an unschooler? It matters <br/>\nbecause it lends legitimacy to what is largely a pagan movement (pagan, not <br/>\nsecular). The Christian with a relaxed homeschooling style, when he declares <br/>\nhimself an unschooler, gives tacit approval to the unschooling movement. And that <br/>\nunschooling movement is not simply just an education style, it is a lifestyle. <br/>\nA lifestyle that rejects fundamentals of the Bible -- that children are to be <br/>\ntrained, to be taught, to be nurtured in the fear and admonition of the Lord.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(there was more)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81829,"nextTopicId":81801}}
