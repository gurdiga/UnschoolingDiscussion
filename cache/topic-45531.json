Although I wish Aunt Elizabeth had learned the lesson <br/>\na bit further and not have been autocratic anymore, either. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids and Darin and I were watching a movie the other night called *Lloyd* <br/>\n(I think) It was all about the preteen set, in school and their relationships <br/>\nwith peers and other adults. Moly was just shocked at how children are <br/>\ntreated in school. Of course the movie exaggerated some points, but the <br/>\nmessage was clear. How children learn and are treated in school isn&#39;t fair or <br/>\nnice. She kept looking at Darin and me with big eyes. At the time, we were <br/>\nlaughing and reminiscing about how this or that person reminded us of one <br/>\nteacher or another. (the PE teacher was exactly like one of mine in grade <br/>\nschool) After the movie was over she asked if that was really how things are <br/>\nin school. Darin, who had a mostly good school experience said *well <br/>\nsometimes but not usually* but I told her that although many things were <br/>\nexaggerated to be comical, the idea and message of school was right on.<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] TCS the modern view?","postDate":"1034047049","msgId":45710,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDA3LjIxMTcyOS4xNDM2LjUuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":45709,"nextInTopic":45722,"prevInTime":45709,"nextInTime":45711,"topicId":45531,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Liz, I am having a very hard time understanding.
