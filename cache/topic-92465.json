Some family pressure or being<br/>\n  sick or<br/>\n  &gt; worried about money, and you can blurt out the fears of 50 years ago in<br/>\n  the voice<br/>\n  &gt; of your grandmother.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I really needed to read this today.  Our family has been under tremendous<br/>\n  amounts of stress for the last 5 months.   We left our last church (we have<br/>\n  been in ministry for the last 15 years) over issues we could not support.<br/>\n  It was our decision but that still didn&#39;t make it any easier.  We lived with<br/>\n  my dh parents for the first 2.5 months and are now with mine.  We have<br/>\n  finally made a decision on the where in the world we will live and now we<br/>\n  are searching for a home.  We have made major transitions in career, etc...<br/>\n  There are days I feel like a complete failure with my girls.  Just about<br/>\n  everything we own is in storage.  They don&#39;t have the normal access to stuff<br/>\n  to do like their art, games, etc., etc..  Our youngest has really had a hard<br/>\n  time with all of this.

I realize that I am trying to<br/>\nmanipulate him into the realization that he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nneed school to learn. I keep leaving The Teenage<br/>\nLiberation Handbook around, on the couch, on the<br/>\ncoffee table, on the kitchen table, on the bathroom<br/>\nsink. So far he hasn&#39;t said a word or picked it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like we&#39;re THIS close. I also think I&#39;m going<br/>\nto make it impossible if I keep getting my signals<br/>\ncrossed like I did last night. I know I have to get<br/>\nrid of school thinking. I just keep reading more and<br/>\nmore material about unschooling and questioning myself<br/>\nand my husband. We talk about it daily and examine how<br/>\nschool has taught us to think about everything and<br/>\nanything in our lives. I want to let it go and just<br/>\nwhen I think I&#39;ve got it, some new layer appears. It&#39;s<br/>\ninsidious how deep it runs. I know it can&#39;t be<br/>\novernight.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are right about it taking time, and this is one of my ongoing struggles<br/>\nalso - and it has gotten easier for me with the help of the discussions on<br/>\nthis list. You will not get rid of it completely until you are out of school<br/>\nfor good.<br/>\nJust a thought about Teen.Lib.Han. - he may not be picking it up because he<br/>\nis still tied up with certain books being &quot;studied&quot; at a certain grade -<br/>\nperhaps he doesn&#39;t see himself as a teen??? Is this a crazy notion? I<br/>\nremember thinking that way in school - and having the converse that once I<br/>\nhad read a certain book for school it was forever tied to that age/grade as<br/>\nbeing &quot;simpler&quot; or &quot;easier&quot; than the later books. This did not apply to the<br/>\nbooks I was reading for pleasure outside of school. We read &quot;Romeo and<br/>\nJuliet&quot; in Year 7, &quot;Anthony and Cleopatra&quot; in Year 10, but &quot;Othello&quot; in Year<br/>\n12.<br/>\nIt must be hard to have his Grandfather&#39;s love so tied to performance and<br/>\nexternal things. I suppose he fears that he would lose that love if he was<br/>\nout of school without the &quot;objective&quot; measure of grades. Since the amount of<br/>\nmoney is pretty sizeable, it is easy to see it as a measure of love. What<br/>\nelse do they do together? Have you read &quot;Punished By Rewards&quot; (Alfie Kohn)?<br/>\nWouldn&#39;t it be great if your son was freely given gifts of money or stuff he<br/>\nlikes, with no strings attached, just for the pleasure of the giver, without<br/>\nany kind of notion that he was being prepared for &quot;The Real World&quot; where you<br/>\nhave to work for a living.

Then<br/>\n  someone told me about their experience with that<br/>\n  growing up-how her Mom would let her take mental<br/>\n  health days but that she had to have some activity or<br/>\n  project planned. Apparently that stuck in my school<br/>\n  mode head as a &quot;good idea.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n  So when Tyler told me last night that he wanted to<br/>\n  take today off, I blurted out &quot;Well, fine. But you&#39;re<br/>\n  not going to stay home and play gameboy all day like<br/>\n  you did today. You&#39;ll need to plan some kind of<br/>\n  project or have some kind of work you can do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Uh. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Duh.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So he said never mind (of course), but then we all<br/>\n  overslept this morning and he missed the bus. He<br/>\n  wanted me to drive him, but I couldn&#39;t immediately<br/>\n  because I had to get breakfast for the baby. <br/>\n<br/>\n  We started discussing school/no school. I have<br/>\n  succeeded in confusing the hell out of the poor kid<br/>\n  and now he doesn&#39;t know what he &quot;should&quot; do. He said<br/>\n  that if he stays home he just wants to lay around and<br/>\n  do nothing. Of course! He needs to deschool! I am<br/>\n  learning to speak more openly with him, but struggling<br/>\n  with allowing him to see that I am not *in control* of<br/>\n  my own thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He&#39;s home and I told him that if he has a ton of work<br/>\n  to make up, it&#39;s up to him if he wants to do it or<br/>\n  not. I also offered to help if he wants help.<br/>\n<br/>\n  See, his grandpa pays him $10 for every A he gets, so<br/>\n  he&#39;s invested in grades. I think that&#39;s a huge<br/>\n  mistake, and am trying to find a way to gently pull<br/>\n  out of that, but don&#39;t think there is a gentle way. He<br/>\n  wants to do all of the homework and classwork, even<br/>\n  though he knows the material already; because each<br/>\n  assignment counts towards final grade. It&#39;s not about<br/>\n  the material, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He said that if he doesn&#39;t do his work, he feels like<br/>\n  he&#39;s not doing his best work, then got mad and said<br/>\n  &quot;Now I&#39;m starting to sound like the stupid principal!<br/>\n  He&#39;s brainwashing me!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes he is!!! and alas, so am I!<br/>\n<br/>\n  He then made the observation that he feels like the<br/>\n  principal is like the owner of a big company and that<br/>\n  the students are all like little workers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yeah! They&#39;re not LIKE that, they ARE that. So we<br/>\n  talked about how the education system is a business<br/>\n  that employs a lot of people who are all invested in<br/>\n  the success of the school in terms of #&#39;s-grades and<br/>\n  test scores-because then the govt. gives the school<br/>\n  more money!<br/>\n<br/>\n  So some backpedalling today and praying. He spent an<br/>\n  hour or so on the floor in his room playing with all<br/>\n  of his Mage Knight figures. He hasn&#39;t played with<br/>\n  those in months. He&#39;s got out the wooden blocks and is<br/>\n  building fortresses for them and making a big battle<br/>\n  plan. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Now he just got the acoustic guitar we bought at a<br/>\n  yard sale out of the garage and cleaned it up. We<br/>\n  watched *School of Rock* the other night and it<br/>\n  convinced him of what he&#39;s been thinking for a few<br/>\n  months, that he wants to learn to play electric<br/>\n  guitar. We can&#39;t swing that right at the moment, would<br/>\n  have to save for a bit, but we do have this acoustic<br/>\n  one that sounds great, and only cost us $2. So I<br/>\n  called our local music store and after the baby wakes<br/>\n  from her nap we&#39;re going to drop the guitar off to be<br/>\n  restrung and tuned and to ask some questions. We have<br/>\n  a computer program for learning guitar that he can&#39;t<br/>\n  wait to dig into. I want to learn too.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is tricky. I realize that I am trying to<br/>\n  manipulate him into the realization that he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  need school to learn. I keep leaving The Teenage<br/>\n  Liberation Handbook around, on the couch, on the<br/>\n  coffee table, on the kitchen table, on the bathroom<br/>\n  sink. So far he hasn&#39;t said a word or picked it up.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I feel like we&#39;re THIS close. I also think I&#39;m going<br/>\n  to make it impossible if I keep getting my signals<br/>\n  crossed like I did last night. I know I have to get<br/>\n  rid of school thinking. I just keep reading more and<br/>\n  more material about unschooling and questioning myself<br/>\n  and my husband. We talk about it daily and examine how<br/>\n  school has taught us to think about everything and<br/>\n  anything in our lives. I want to let it go and just<br/>\n  when I think I&#39;ve got it, some new layer appears. It&#39;s<br/>\n  insidious how deep it runs. I know it can&#39;t be<br/>\n  overnight.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It just takes a lot of practice, right? Just keep<br/>\n  going and keep questioning and keep talking? It will<br/>\n  get better?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  __________________________________<br/>\n  Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n  Yahoo!
