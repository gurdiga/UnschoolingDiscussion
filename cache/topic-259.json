Don&#39;t let &#39;em bully you!!!  You can talk to CURE as well...the woman I spoke to was very helpful.  I was never bothered and then I got a letter one day asking for my letter of intent.  I informed them very politely that I appreciated their interest (HA!) but, as they knew this was not required and that I didn&#39;t require any of their services...I did not see this changeing in the future...If it did I would let them know.  You get the idea.  Hope this helps.
