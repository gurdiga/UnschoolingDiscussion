Again I find it hard to ignore the research on hours <br/>\nspent watching TV. I accept that you don&#39;t pay much notice to the research, <br/>\nbut it does make me nervous.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what these &quot;experts&quot; view as limitless TV watching is from school <br/>\nkids and most school kids do not have unlimited TV watching rules. They have <br/>\nschool to go to so they are gone, have to go to bed early and have to cram <br/>\nfamily stuff in on weekends. They have TV restrictions even though some <br/>\nparents don&#39;t actually say &quot;no more TV.&quot; So to do studies on limitless <br/>\nwatching that would be more accurate, you would have to actually let <br/>\nchildren be able to watch TV all day long for a long period of time. <br/>\nSomething unschoolers have a chance to do. But just like with limiting snack <br/>\nfoods, kids who don&#39;t have the restriction, don&#39;t feel the need to cram it <br/>\nall in. Whether it be food or TV watching.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough we pay attention to what the kids are watching, I have never <br/>\nlimited their TV at all.. My kitchen opens into the playroom where most of <br/>\nthe toys are and also the TV. I see pretty much on a constant basis what the <br/>\nkids are doing and watching. I watch them with the TV and most of the time, <br/>\nthey&#39;re eating, drawing, building and even acting out with their people what <br/>\nthey have just watched. They aren&#39;t for the most part, &quot;just sitting&quot; and <br/>\nwatching TV. I never have a fear that they are watching too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy MIL asks every week if our 2 year old doesn&#39;t like Barney or something. <br/>\nHer great grandchild was propped in front of Barney since she was 3 months <br/>\nold. She&#39;s also been in daycare that long too. THAT, I have a problem with. <br/>\nMy little one could care less about any TV. It&#39;s on all the time here in one <br/>\nroom or another. (Well, not exactly all the time but a lot. The kids just <br/>\nforget to turn it off.) I don&#39;t worry about her lack of interest any more <br/>\nthan I worry about the others watching too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46264,"nextTopicId":46397}}
