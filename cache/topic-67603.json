I think what got the love for reading <br/>\ngoing was the Harry Potter books and especially Captain Underpants series. He <br/>\ntook them and I think he wanted to impress me with how many he read that he <br/>\ndid three in one night. The next night was the same and so on. He stops and <br/>\ngoes in spurts. Now he is reading a documentary on the Navy Seals and before <br/>\nhe read Halo.  I dont think if the school saw him now if they would believe <br/>\nme but its true. <br/>\nMy main silent wishes for him this year was reading and for our family to be <br/>\ncloser. So far I am thrilled with how it has all come together.<br/>\nWith my son we found out that when he read out loud he didn&#39;t remember much. <br/>\nHis silent reading was much better in comprehension. Your son may be the <br/>\nopposite. <br/>\nMaybe he will never take interest in reading to himself but I also think that <br/>\nif they have something that interests them it will happen.<br/>\nWhen I stopped worrying about the book thing is when he took off with it. He <br/>\nread magazines, comic books, gamer guides and others.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive him time it will happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma2kids","from":"&quot;zenmomma2kids&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: reading worries","postDate":"1052062255","msgId":67654,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI5M2JuZitmaWo1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFlOS43ZjAyMDlmLjJiZTU5YWNlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":67603,"nextInTopic":67699,"prevInTime":67653,"nextInTime":67655,"topicId":67603,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I think back to the big books that I had to read at her age, and think <br/>\nwhat she chooses is junkfood in words. A product of my own schooling. Lately <br/>\nshe has been reading what interests her, like Lizzie McGuire paperbacks. <br/>\nShort and easy. And doesn&#39;t always finish them. I know I shouldn&#39;t worry <br/>\nabout it. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe stayed up half the night the other night reading her Disney Adventures <br/>\nmagazine. I can&#39;t ever remember reading half the night something that I found <br/>\ninteresting, only staying up to late to finish some boring book that I was <br/>\nassigned and procrastinated with. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe just read three Captain Underpants books in a day and a half. I had no <br/>\nidea how funny the books were, until she read aloud to me her favorite parts. <br/>\nI was actually impressed with the vocabulary and adult humor in them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not worried so much anymore. :0)<br/>\n<br/>\nAng<br/>\nUnschooling mom to<br/>\nMegan(10) Ashlyn(3) Christian(1.5) <br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/unolist/index.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/unolist/index.html&quot;</a>&gt;UNO Unschoolers Network of Ohio&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.aol.com/megamom08/page1.html&quot;\">http://members.aol.com/megamom08/page1.html&quot;</a>&gt;My Links Page MEGAMOM08&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67697,"nextTopicId":67267}}
