How much freedom do you give the kids?</tt><tt></tt>\n\n<p><tt>2. In what way do you keep track of what the child had done and\nlearned?</tt><tt></tt>\n\n<p><tt>3. How do you stimulate the child to read?</tt><tt></tt>\n\n<p><tt>4.

Thanks\n<br>&gt;&nbsp; Dianna\n<br>&gt;\n\n<p>You&#39;re still gonna get a lot of that!&nbsp; (contradictions, I mean)\n\n<p>Essentially (IMO) homeschool is any activity that is education at home\nrather\n<br>than a traditional school.&nbsp; Well, that isn&#39;t good either.&nbsp;\nHow about\n<br>education directed by the parents/guardians/family and based from home...?\n<br>Unschooled is less structure.&nbsp; For some it means no structure\nand strictly\n<br>child-led.\n\n<p>I avoid grade labeling.&nbsp; At first it was difficult for ds to know\nhow to\n<br>answer when someone asked what grade he was in; he felt like he somehow\n<br>didn&#39;t belong because he didn&#39;t have a label like everyone else he\nknew.&nbsp; So,\n<br>I took opportunities to point out to him when he had just learned something\n<br>and say something like &#39;Look!&nbsp; You just counted the correct change\nto the\n<br>clerk.&nbsp; That counts as our math lesson for the day.&#39;&nbsp; A few\nexamples and he\n<br>started feeling more confident that he was getting enough &#39;school&#39;.\n\n<p>Now when someone asks what grade he&#39;s in, he simply responds that we\n<br>homeschool and don&#39;t use grade categories!\n\n<p>He will be 12 in October.&nbsp; He has never been to ps.&nbsp; We have\nat times tried a\n<br>more structured approach, but always fall off the wagon.&nbsp; I finally\ngave\n<br>myself permission to decide that our homeschool style was unstructured\nand\n<br>we&#39;ve done great every since!&nbsp; At first I got real nervous about\nthe &#39;what if\n<br>we miss something&#39; dilemma.&nbsp; But, as time has gone on I see how\nsilly I was\n<br>to be concerned.&nbsp; There is no way to STOP ds from learning!&nbsp;\nHe explores\n<br>things on his own.&nbsp; When I insist on a time table or set curriculum,\nI get in\n<br>his way.\n\n<p>I still use a text for math, but not for any other subjects.&nbsp; That\nmay change\n<br>in the future, depending on the needs as we go.&nbsp; Even the math\ntext is used\n<br>very loosely.&nbsp; We don&#39;t follow the schedule and will do a lot\nof on again,\n<br>off again work.&nbsp; It often depends on the weather!&nbsp; If it&#39;s\ndreary outside (or\n<br>too hot!) we&#39;ll do more inside things which may include the math text.\n\n<p>As for assessments...I rely on conversations with my child.&nbsp; I\ncan clearly\n<br>tell he understands use of the English language, for instance (or at\nleast\n<br>our Americanized version!).&nbsp; He often comes to me with a theory\nhe has come\n<br>up with about xyz which will lead to exploration to discover if he\nis\n<br>correct.&nbsp; It truly amazes me what I can learn about my child by\njust talking\n<br>and sharing with him.\n\n<p>We read a lot aloud and silently.&nbsp; I have him read to me as well\nas my\n<br>reading to him.&nbsp; Family reading time leads to great discussions\nand lets me\n<br>know how well he is understanding what he reads and the world around\nhim.\n<br>The questions he asks as we are reading are great clues.&nbsp; For\ninstance, the\n<br>reading might have the word &#39;racism&#39; in it; he has difficulty pronouncing\nthe\n<br>word, so we sound it out; then he asks what it means and it leads to\na\n<br>discussion.&nbsp; Now, the next time we run into that topic, we&#39;ll\nhave a\n<br>different discussion and I can tell he&#39;s learned from one time to another.\n\n<p>As for nouns, verbs, etc.&nbsp; As far as I&#39;m concerned an 8 yr old\nhas no need to\n<br>worry about such things.&nbsp; If he can instinctively put together\ndecent\n<br>sentence structure, who cares whether he knows how many nouns, verbs,\n<br>adverbs, adjectives, etc., were used in the sentence.\n\n<p>Best real life use I&#39;ve ever had for such information was a fill-in-the\nblank\n<br>story game asking me to list nouns, verbs, etc., which were then put\ninto a\n<br>story line.&nbsp; Very humorous and lots of fun, but hardly an essential\nlife\n<br>skill.\n\n<p>Eiraul\n\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;e|-\n<br>&quot;Is It Time To Re-Establish Your Credit?
