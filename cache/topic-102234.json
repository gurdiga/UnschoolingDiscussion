I truly believe that the people who will succeed at <br/>\nunderstanding unschooling are the people who for whatever reason <br/>\nreally *want* to understand it.  I have a friend, a former <br/>\nhomeschooler, who &quot;tried&quot; unschooling briefly.  The only problem was <br/>\nthat she fully expected her kids to just naturally keep up to grade <br/>\nlevel of their own volition.  I also remember her bringing the kids <br/>\nto the library so they could pick their own topics to *study* and <br/>\nbeing almost insulted that they didn&#39;t want to study *anything*.  <br/>\nWhen I tried to talk to her more about the philosophy behind it her <br/>\neyes would practically glaze over.  The fact was she didn&#39;t really <br/>\n*want* to get it, she just wanted to take an easier road to the same <br/>\ndestination (grade level).  When she realized that no such road <br/>\nexisted and she had to change her goals as well for unschooling to <br/>\nwork, she went back to school at home, and then shortly after that <br/>\nput her kids back in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI truly believe that the people who will succeed at understanding <br/>\nunschooling are the people who for whatever reason really *want* to <br/>\nunderstand it.  And those people will continue reading and thinking <br/>\nwell past the point where they could possibly have the idea <br/>\nthat &quot;learning as a by-product of a busy joyful life&quot; means that <br/>\nparents need not do anything but watch soap operas.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatti</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":137729143,"authorName":"Lynn Allen","from":"Lynn Allen &lt;nnylnell@...&gt;","profile":"nnylnell","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: strewing (was doing too little)","postDate":"1104793570","msgId":102234,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMTAzMjMwNjEwLjYzOTM4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjYwNDAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMDQ3Njk5NzUuMTI3OC4zNDYwOS5tMjJAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":102242,"prevInTime":102233,"nextInTime":102235,"topicId":102234,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What I see people being concerned with is a hypothetical newbie-or-potential unschooler coming to the list (or another list, or an unschooling group support","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2054622394\">What I see people being concerned with is a<br/>\nhypothetical newbie-or-potential unschooler coming to<br/>\nthe list (or another list, or an unschooling group<br/>\nsupport meeting) with the urgent question, &quot;But how on<br/>\nearth do they learn geography (science, history,<br/>\netc.)?&quot; -- which we all know happens all the time. And<br/>\nthen not reading very closely, or listening very hard,<br/>\nand staying around for about five minutes, and somehow<br/>\njust remembering vaguely that someone said something<br/>\nabout putting up a map or getting a microscope. And<br/>\nthen deciding that that&#39;s what unschooling is -- you<br/>\n&quot;teach&quot; geography by putting up a map, which magically<br/>\nresults in your child being able to identify the major<br/>\nrivers of the world and the imports and exports of<br/>\nBrazil. And then putting up a map, leaving it there<br/>\nand saying nothing about it, not using it herself, and<br/>\na month later realizing indignantly that not only do<br/>\nthe kids appear not to have noticed it, they still<br/>\ncan&#39;t find their own state on the map and don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat hemisphere Asia is in. Which means unschooling<br/>\nhas failed and they need a curriculum, or at least a<br/>\nlot more &quot;structure.&quot; And they go all over ridiculing<br/>\nunschooling and telling everyone that unschoolers<br/>\ndon&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about and their kids<br/>\nare all ignoramuses.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I think this is a ridiculous fear and that this <br/>\ncould never happen? No, of course not. I think it<br/>\nhappens all the time. Most people don&#39;t get<br/>\nunschooling<br/>\neven if they try, or think they&#39;ve tried. Most people<br/>\ndon&#39;t think very hard, or read very carefully. In my<br/>\nopinion. They fall back on convention and popular<br/>\nopinion because it&#39;s the easiest thing to do and it<br/>\nmakes their brain hurt to think anything too out of<br/>\nthe ordinary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know. I&#39;ve done it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I do understand the concerns, because I think we<br/>\nencounter people like this all the time -- the people<br/>\nwho say, &quot;Well, my son never asked me to teach him<br/>\nanalytic geometry, no matter how many pattern blocks I<br/>\nleft on the coffee table, so I decided to stop<br/>\nunschooling&quot; or &quot;We could never be unschoolers because<br/>\nthe kids never want to learn anything -- they just<br/>\nhave fun all day&quot; (auugghhhh!). The thing is, I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink you can blame strewing, or the people who<br/>\nadvocate strewing, for the misunderstanding of all<br/>\nthose people. Certainly on this list, I can&#39;t imagine<br/>\nhow anyone who reads with their brain engaged for more<br/>\nthan a few days could actually come away with the<br/>\nimpression that unschooling was just about changing<br/>\nyour &quot;teaching style&quot; (i.e., throwing away the<br/>\nmandatory geography workbooks and putting up maps)<br/>\nrather than your whole attitude toward education<br/>\n(i.e., geography is just part of life and the world,<br/>\nand in a rich, supportive environment kids will<br/>\nnaturally and easily learn all they need or want to<br/>\nknow about it). And if they do come away with that<br/>\nimpression (I&#39;m absolutely positive there are people<br/>\nwho do) they would have anyway, whether anyone talked<br/>\nabout strewing or not. <br/>\n<br/>\nStrewing is about *creating* that rich, supportive<br/>\nenvironment that makes learning fun and effortless,<br/>\nnot about being a new and improved technique for<br/>\ninserting unwanted information into the brains of the<br/>\nunwilling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat there are people who may misinterpret the term<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make it any less valuable to do it, just as<br/>\nthe fact that there are people who read the word<br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; as meaning &quot;neglect&quot; doesn&#39;t mean we<br/>\nshould abandon the term, or the lifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nhaving said all that . . . <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Having spent many years helping people lose the<br/>\n&gt; schoolish agenda, it  baffled <br/>\n&gt; me to be accused hard and fast of all kinds of<br/>\n&gt; manipulative evil.
