She said\n&gt; they had plenty of money in their budget for those books.&nbsp; I quickly whipped\n&gt; out my copy of The Unschooling Handbook and she ordered it from Amazon.com as\n&gt; we were talking.&nbsp; She asked me if there were anymore I could recommend.&nbsp; I\n&gt; could only think of the Colfax&#39;s book and didn&#39;t know if that was unschooling\n&gt; or homeschooling.&nbsp; Anyway she ordered that.\n&gt;\n&gt; I told her about the unschooling loop and she asked me to ask you for\n&gt; recommendations of unschooling books.&nbsp; She is more than willing to buy\n&gt; several more books if I can give her the names and authors...</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;</p></span></blockquote></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9583,"nextTopicId":9658}}
