Jane was finding these <br/>\nbeautiful  elegantly worded but mysterious written messages left on <br/>\ntrees in the  jungle. (If my 30 year old memory is serving me.) But she <br/>\nknew they  couldn&#39;t be coming from the equally mysterious but <br/>\nnon-speaking wild  man.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE RIGHT!  <br/>\nHe learned to read and write but not to speak. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy favorite parts of the book were his childhood.  I cried and cried  about <br/>\nthe dead ape-baby.  I think I was 12 when I read that, and I was  really <br/>\nfascinated by his find of his parents&#39; place (without his having any idea  they were <br/>\nhis parents, I think).  That is one great passage, and if anyone  here missed <br/>\nit, it&#39;s Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs.<br/>\n <br/>\nHEY, I was going to to go and give a link and say &quot;You can get it on Amazon  <br/>\nfor a buck fifty&quot; or something, but it&#39;s online in a few places! <br/>\n <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/People/rgs/tarz-table.htm_\">http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/People/rgs/tarz-table.htm_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/People/rgs/tarz-table.htm)\">http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/People/rgs/tarz-table.htm)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\nThere&#39;s one.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s dated, it&#39;s fiction, it&#39;s England-centric, and just like Shogun it  <br/>\nstarts with too much ship-on-ocean and not enough foreign-land, but for its time  <br/>\n(1914) it was like bigtime sci-fi/fantasy.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh.  The cheapest listed on Amazon is not $1.50.   It&#39;s  $0.01.  A penny <br/>\n(plus shipping &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\nThat&#39;s pretty funny!  The next more expensive one is 11 cents.  I  started to <br/>\nsay Burroughs might be rolling over in his grave, but in 1914 11  cents <br/>\nAmerican was probably pretty good for a pulp novel. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nNope.  It was $1.50 new in the U.S.  Here they have the history  of the <br/>\npublication and some of the early cover art.  VERY cool art:<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tarzan.com/bib/0483.html_\">http://www.tarzan.com/bib/0483.html_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tarzan.com/bib/0483.html)\">http://www.tarzan.com/bib/0483.html)</a> <br/>\nI think that red one, first left on third row on the bottom display of  cover <br/>\nart was the one I read.  Not positive, but that one looks really  familiar.<br/>\n <br/>\nOne thing leads to another if you follow those trails...<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106599,"nextTopicId":106017}}
