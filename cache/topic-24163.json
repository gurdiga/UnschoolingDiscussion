Now perhaps there are boys out there who have it all <br/>\ntogether enough that they would be turned off by the fact that <br/>\nthese images are degrading stereotypes of women.  Perhaps, <br/>\nbut what about the other 98% who will be thinking, &quot;Wow.  <br/>\nNaked.  Boobs.  Wow.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not say forbid.  I did not say create a &#39;fobidden fruit&#39; <br/>\natmosphere.  What I was talking about was monitoring content, <br/>\nso you know what is being watched, so you can discuss it.  It is <br/>\ndeliberately designed, produced and marketed to be as <br/>\ncompelling as possible, by very, very smart and sophisticated <br/>\npeople.  I am sure all these unschooled kids are as savvy as <br/>\nthey come, but they are still inexperienced, and vulnerable to this <br/>\nstuff.  However savvy a twelve-year-old may be, he is not as savvy <br/>\nas the team of marketers that are targeting him.   It&#39;s a pretty <br/>\ncomplex issue, and takes a lot of sorting to figure out.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, THIS is directed at you personally, because I am asking for <br/>\nclarification on your personal position.  Are you telling me that <br/>\nyou believe that that kind of imagery (by this I mean the typical <br/>\nhypersexualized images of women) holds no interest for your <br/>\ntwelve-year-old son?  That he regards it as &#39;nasty and awful&#39;?  <br/>\nWhat if he doesn&#39;t? Or, what if he does?  What if he does see it <br/>\nas nasty and awful and gross and scary, but still finds himself <br/>\ndrawn to it?  That is the nature of pornography - it is INTENDED <br/>\nto be thus.  What protection does he have?  You&#39;re telling me <br/>\nhe&#39;s on his own, because you believe if there is a problem, he&#39;ll <br/>\nlet you know?  The purveyors of pornography in our society are <br/>\nsophisticated predators.  You are happy to let them have as <br/>\nmuch access to your son as he deems appropriate, without any <br/>\nmonitoring from you?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not saying he IS watching this stuff.  I am saying that from <br/>\nwhat you are telling me, you can&#39;t say with much authority that he <br/>\nISN&#39;T, because you aren&#39;t really paying enough attention to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots and lots of women out there are just as sure their <br/>\nhusbands would NEVER.  <br/>\n<br/>\nH.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My kids don&#39;t want stuff they think is gross or scary.

I think you hit the concern with not being able to<br/>\nget up early when needed. On Wednesday my kids decided to take classes with<br/>\nthe homeschool cooperative this year. This means we must be out the door by<br/>\n7:15.   I don&#39;t mind giving the kids flexibility with the bedtime, but when<br/>\ndad is home, he expects them to turn in early and it becomes an issue.<br/>\nJohanna<br/>\nLife is the ultimate learning experience!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 05, 2001 4:12 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] bedtimes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 9/5/01 10:44:10 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:saninocencio@...\">saninocencio@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; What do you folks think about having bedtimes?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We don&#39;t have them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kirby is an all-nighter risk, so I ask him to get to sleep by 5:00 a.m.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes he goes to sleep at 2:00 or 3:00 but he&#39;s almost always the last<br/>\n&gt; person up, and he gets up at noon.
