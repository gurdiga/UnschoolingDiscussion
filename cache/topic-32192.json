So I thought school<br/>\n&gt;might give him something all his own & feed his outgoing social nature.  I<br/>\n&gt;hoped we&#39;d see an improvement in his negative behavior. He was behind<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can completely relate and have many times questioned my choice to keep the <br/>\nkids home when they seem so unhappy. My oldest sounds similar to your son. <br/>\nShe is also 7. We have 3 kids 7,5,2. It seems my oldest has a negative first <br/>\nreaction to many things. I have found the more I push her out in the world <br/>\nthe more negative she becomes. So I treaat her very baby like, hold her when <br/>\nI can, spend time one on one. Now my baby is 2 and you have a newborn who is <br/>\nyour primary focus. Do you have 1 close friend who your kids enjoy spending <br/>\ntime with? Now is the time to ask for help so you can focus on the sweet <br/>\nbaby with a difficult nursing situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for money, we have always just gotten by, short most months. Something <br/>\nthat helps us is that many things can be borrowed from libraries, and thrift <br/>\nstories hold many treasures. Kids as young as ours really do not need to own <br/>\nmuch. The internet can lead to many great conversations. We rent tapes from <br/>\nthe library too, like beginning watercolor, then let the kids go. Also, when <br/>\nrelatives ask what you need be very specific. If you really need storage <br/>\nboxes instead of another plastic toy, say so.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow is also a time for your partner to get closer to the 2 older kids. They <br/>\nget their cups full from a loving person and the burden does not weigh on <br/>\nyou. Oh, I let my kids sleep with me while baby is on my other side. <br/>\nSomething about that night time cuddle helps a ton. And it is not your <br/>\nresponsibility to make your little guy happy, though in hurts a ton to see <br/>\nthem unhappy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been tired, burned out from kids off and on during the 7 years I have <br/>\nbeen a mama. I know reaching out to other like minded folks makes a <br/>\ndifference. I wish you well, rest, and peace in your home.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32191,"nextTopicId":32197}}
