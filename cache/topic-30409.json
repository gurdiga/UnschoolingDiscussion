Scott Peck (The Road Less Traveled and others)and the words struck me as something that may be taking place in most homes where a child is considered a problem. (and yes, I&#39;m looking in the mirror... that&#39;s why I&#39;m reading the book!). Anyway, from the back cover:<br/>\n&quot;...People who are evil attack others instead of facing their own failures. Peck demonstrates the havoc these People of the Lie work in the lives of those around them. He presents, from vivid incidents  encountered in his psychiatric practice, examples of evil in everyday life. ...&quot;<br/>\nThe case I&#39;m reading about now is a boy whose brother committed suicide and now, the surviving brother is digging at his own skin, his grades are failing and he&#39;s like a zombie. The parents are not seeking medical help for him... not until he steals a car and crashes it and it becomes a court order to do so. The psychiatrist finally determines that the boy is convinced he&#39;s evil and the child believes he is the cause of his brother&#39;s suicide (not) and because of his parents&#39; bizarre behavior and lack of support, he gets worse and worse. (his parents gave him the weapon his brother used to commit suicide one xmas, for example). If you want to know the end... scroll down, otherwise delete now and go get the book....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nin the end, the boy is removed from his home and taken to an aunt&#39;s home in another state because *he* really isn&#39;t the problem... it&#39;s his parents. He gets better after being in a loving environment after awhile. So far in my reading, the parents are refusing treatment for themselves. :(<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brendaclaspell@...\">brendaclaspell@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n  It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me that a child who is in a totally loving and <br/>\n  supporting environment, free to live any way he wishes would not thrive. So <br/>\n  if there&#39;s no thriving, there may be other issues. It doesn&#39;t mean the whole <br/>\n  family is screwed up, it just means it&#39;s worth exercising other options first <br/>\n  before taking control away from the child.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Brenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
