And yes, I thank my parents. In some respects (learning, curiousity, courage) they gave me great examples and much freedom.

If they&#39;d restricted the candy I might have nicer, less painful teeth, but I might also have some resentment.

That means that in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2020911117\">In our family, *everyone&#39;s* values have merit. So, in my family, I don&#39;t like Disney, and I boycott Nestle and I care for the environment. That means that in my family my money is not spent on Disney, Nestle or very much plastic. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy kids know why I feel the way I do, we talk about it all the time. Do I hope they grow up with the same values? You betcha. Will they? Not neccessarily. I have three kids who are &quot;old enough&quot; to test the theory so far at 26, 17, and 15. Of those three, two have chosen to also boycott Nestle and and one doesn&#39;t care. None of them are much into Disney or plastic, I guess the future will tell if they take the grandkids to Disneyland and buy them plastic toys galore. :-)<br/>\n <br/>\nDo I care? No. They may do what they chose with their money, just as I chose how to spend my money. When they were younger, they could buy a Butterfinger with their allowance, have one at someone else&#39;s home, get one as a gift. They wouldn&#39;t get one from me. If they asked for one at the store, I would tell them that they needed to pick a different candy, mommy doesn&#39;t buy Nestle.<br/>\n <br/>\nI love my kids, and I respect their choices, but I respect my own choices as well. Not using a lot of plastic is important to me, it is how I chose to do what I can do as one individual. I do not want my kids to grow up thinking that their individual acts of selflessness, of service, of kindness, have less meaning because they alone can&#39;t fix the whole problem. I want them to feel that their actions matter, in some small but significant way.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn the same way I feel that my unschooling my small family of children (well, 5 isn&#39;t so small, I guess, but you get the drift) will have a positive impact on our society. Maybe my 5 won&#39;t begin to outweigh the hundreds of thousands of kids their age who are schooled, but I still feel that my contribution is important and meaningful, to myself, my family and my community, even if it is small. I also feel that my family&#39;s boycott of Nestle, our limiting plastic, and our acknowledging the manipulation and civil rights violations of Disny is important and meaningful.<br/>\n <br/>\nPerhaps living with parents who are passsionate has it&#39;s downside. You certainly do have to wait until you are older to act upon your ultimate decisions on some issues. However, living with passionate people has it&#39;s upside. You get to unschool, and you get to have interesting conversations at the dinner table. My children can articulate their beliefs and defend their opinions with aplomb. They do not always agree with us, and sometimes in very important ways. We have a couple who have chosen to go back to public school after years of unschooling, and I am not a fan of public school in the least. That did not influence their decision, and it does not affect our relationship now that they ahve made a different choice than I would make.<br/>\n <br/>\nPart of my respect for my children is my belief that they will not just follow blindly in my footsteps, but have the education and the personality and the respect for their own beliefs to follow their own heart when the time comes. So far that has proven to be true.<br/>\n <br/>\nAriella<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

The brothers lived very differently and are really different in many ways.  Opposite of how their parents lived.  Similar in some ways, temperament for one, but so very different in their current lives and beliefs.<br/>\nLaura J<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":88929938,"authorName":"Seth W Bartels","from":"Seth W Bartels &lt;ecotopian@...&gt;","profile":"lunamama3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: anti-*crunchy* speech","postDate":"1096912557","msgId":100207,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDA0LjEyNTU1Ny44ODAuNS5lY290b3BpYW5AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":100206,"nextInTopic":100208,"prevInTime":100206,"nextInTime":100208,"topicId":100105,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... haven t we all been young and idealistic at one time?  actually, i think that this is where i m personally at right now being 25! ;)  and i don t think","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-279488985\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;We all &quot;muck up the world&quot; to some extent.

But, very &gt;restrictive in my<br/>\nopinion.  <br/>\n<br/>\ni know it sounds restrictive...and maybe it is with the folks you&#39;re<br/>\ntalking about specifically.  but for my family, it&#39;s about values.  we<br/>\nvalue healthy bodies and a healthy earth as well as personal choices. <br/>\nand instead of being a dictator and demanding my kids never play with<br/>\nplastic toys or eat refined foods, we talk to them about what the impact<br/>\nof these choices are and let them choose.  i&#39;m a crunchy veggie mama who<br/>\nprefers certain things, but has kids with their own minds who have eaten<br/>\nham and fish when away from home(tho veggie as well) and candy (sometimes<br/>\nincluding food coloring) and cookies (even with unwholesome ingredients),<br/>\nplay with plastic toys when they want (but usually choose not to), and<br/>\nwatch plenty of advertising-overloaded, schooly type cartoons by choice. <br/>\nnot all of us are as judgmental or restrictive as you&#39;ve experienced!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But, I do feel a little judged when I bring a pepsi or fast &gt;food for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lunch.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Laura J<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i hear ya!  the same happens to me.  but does it really matter if you&#39;re<br/>\nok with your choices?  for me, the twinge of embarassment comes from<br/>\nknowing it&#39;s perhaps not the best thing i could be ingesting.  but, if i<br/>\nwant it...i eat it anyways and ignore the snootiness. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nlisa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Yahoo!
