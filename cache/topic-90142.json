Nothing to do with the kids<br/>\n(thankfully), just myself getting overwhelmed at the number of things that I<br/>\nwant to accomplish...  Anyway, my husband insisted that we go out to eat<br/>\nlast Saturday at a grand reopening of a vegetarian restaurant here in town.<br/>\nHe knows that going out to eat is one of my greatest joys.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile we were looking at the menu, I noticed that they had vegan chocolate<br/>\nshakes.  I am a vegan and we&#39;ve mastered vegan chocolate shakes at home, but<br/>\nI&#39;ve never had one out and about (I&#39;d never seen them at a restaurant<br/>\nbefore).  So, here I was completely stressed, trying really hard to relax<br/>\nand enjoy my wonderful family and I couldn&#39;t get myself to spend $4.25 on a<br/>\nshake because I could make a bigger one at home for less money.  DH,<br/>\nappropriately said, &quot;It&#39;s $4.25, a massage is $60 and a psychologist visit<br/>\nis how much?  $100, $200?  Order the shake.&quot;  I did, it was wonderful and I<br/>\nwas able to calm down and relax for the entire meal and a while after that.<br/>\nTotally worth $4.25.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes &quot;retail therapy&quot; costs a lot less than we would think, because it<br/>\nis therapuetic to the soul.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lisa in AZ</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90052,"nextTopicId":90156}}
