You pursue <br/>\nyours, I&#39;ll pursue mine?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned the hard way that kids need to learn to entertain themselves sometimes - it&#39;s part of learning.  The &quot;real world&quot; doesn&#39;t stop for anyone usually, and what will your kids do when they don&#39;t get their way *right away* when they are older?  I&#39;m battling this right now with my 10yo DD - she has honestly NEVER had to entertain herself, on her own, because I was always dropping everything whenever my kids wanted to play or whatever.  But (bad mommy moment here) - sometimes I need time to do things like catch up on work or what have you, without them underfoot.  (I know I might get beaten up for saying this here LOL)  Sure, I can let her help - I&#39;m sure my boss would LOVE that!  Maybe I have a different take on things because I am a single mom - I don&#39;t have the luxury of dropping everything to play with my kids every single time they ask - it&#39;s just part of our life and it&#39;s part of &quot;real life&quot; for alot of folks.  I *so* wish I could still be a SAHM and do just that, but I can&#39;t and my kids understand that now.  And I think it makes them stronger to have to do things for themselves sometimes (play quietly in their room, play the keyboard/guitar without an audience sometimes, etc) rather than knowing &quot;Oh boy! The world really DOES revolve around me!&quot;  I&#39;m afraid if it still did, they&#39;d get a very rude awakening later in life. :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95003301,"authorName":"Tammy","from":"&quot;Tammy &quot; &lt;qpwithcheese@...&gt;","profile":"tammyof4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] moms doing what they want","postDate":"1051749898","msgId":66997,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFQjA2RTBBLjAwMDAwMS4wMzQ1NkByb3NpZT4=","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjE4YVlYZkFLQWs1eVQwMDAwYjI4YUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":66996,"nextInTopic":66998,"prevInTime":66996,"nextInTime":66998,"topicId":66815,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*********** It also helps to accept the fact that most home/unschoolers *don t* have a clean house.

I&#39;ve found the opposite to be true.  When I take them <br/>\nsomewhere they don&#39;t care about, they fight and complain and whine. <br/>\nAS a matter of fact, my son is a huge behavior problem when I take <br/>\nhim somewhere he doesn&#39;t want to go.  I often put off trips to the <br/>\ngrocery store or library until dh gets home from work so that my 5 <br/>\nyear old doesn&#39;t have to go along.  When I go somewhere for them, <br/>\nthey&#39;re happy.  So what I try to do is find things that I can do <br/>\nwhile we&#39;re there that will make all of us happy.  I take a book <br/>\nalong to Mcdonalds and read for an hour while they&#39;re pretending the <br/>\nball pits are Freddi Fish&#39;s whirlpools.  Sometimes I take them to the <br/>\npark and follow them around for hours with their dump trucks, sitting <br/>\nin the sand box with them, pushing them in swings.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One way I spend time alongside my children while pursuing my own <br/>\n&gt; interests is to have a sofa in their playroom where I can read, <br/>\n&gt; write, or whatever I&#39;m doing.

My kids go shopping with me (when they want to or when <br/>\nthey have no other choice), to appointments, family gatherings, <br/>\nrestaurants, play video games with their dad that they wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nexposed to if they didn&#39;t see him playing them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut they need me to do things with them.  If I only had one child I <br/>\ncould see where I&#39;d have oodles of time to myself.  Or if my children <br/>\nwere all older.  But my 3 kids are all under 10 and even if I only <br/>\njust met their physical needs it would take a huge part of my day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think of the sheer pleasure I feel when I play a boardgame WITH my <br/>\ndaughter and see her figuring something out.

That&#39;s really what I do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  After seeing that my children have all their needs met, making sure all the pets have the same, my husband&#39;s needs and taking care of the house, I have no time or energy for anything else. And I can honestly say I have no desire to get out with friends or have an interest that is solely my own. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t go out with the girls. Our local homeschool group did a moms night out. I never went. I have no desire in the evening to be away from my children and my husband. Once in awhile I may take a trip to the grocery store or Target without any children but that&#39;s it. My husband and I do dinner or a movie alone maybe once or twice at the most in a month. It&#39;s actually been about 2 months though since we did that. Everything we pretty much do is with our children. Everything I pretty much do is with my children. I never do any kind of tupperware or such parties because that would take me away from my famliy to be with a bunch of women instead. Not my idea of fun. <br/>\n<br/>\n  The only time I have been away from my children is when I had one and was in the hospital, spent the night out briefly 2 Valentines days ago and went to Chicago for Oprah with Tara. In 9 years, that&#39;s the extent of my away from the children time. I get my grown up talk when my children meet with others and I have their moms to talk with. I have this list that gets read when the kids are eating or like right now, totally into playing with their hermit crabs. I also stay up until 2 a.m. so I have plenty of time then to read the news and check out this list or anything else on the web I&#39;m searching for. I get an occasional magazine to read once in awhile but mostly the new issue is out before I&#39;ve read the old one. I do vedge with my husband and a tv show every so often but that&#39;s totally with the children either watching with us or coming back and forth to interact. Movies that we only want to watch alone are done after midnight on the weekends when the kids for the most part are alseep.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I really am happy with the way things are. If our health holds up, my husband and I will have plenty of time when the children won&#39;t want to hang around us all the time. We&#39;ll have our alone time then. I see it already with Tara. And if I got hit by a bus tomorrow, I would have no regrets at all as to how I parent. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Mary B <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

If you don&#39;t have your own <br/>\ninterests, you&#39;re robbing your children of an important part of <br/>\nlife.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRead The Continuum Concept.  Children are not biologically designed <br/>\nto have their mothers sit there playing with them all day long.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re designed to follow us and learn what the world is about by <br/>\nseeing what adults do.  That&#39;s why so many toys are miniatures of <br/>\nadult items, like stoves.  Kids play because it&#39;s how they learn <br/>\nabout the world and practice their role in it.  Many, many kids&#39; toys <br/>\nare farms and farm animals.  That goes back to a time in this country <br/>\nwhen children would grow up actually working on a farm and taking <br/>\ncare of animals.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found that when I try to do things specifically because I think <br/>\nthe children will like them, they start whining and throwing <br/>\ntantrums, which is not how they usually act.  For example, we take <br/>\nthem camping or on picnics or to the Renaissance Festival or the <br/>\nbookstore or whatever because my husband and I enjoy these things.  <br/>\nMy children have a great time and everyone&#39;s happy.  But if I take <br/>\nthem somewhere &quot;for kids&quot; that I don&#39;t personally enjoy, like Chuck <br/>\nE. Cheese&#39;s, they start fighting, and yelling, and crying.

It&#39;s actually been about 2 months though since we did that. Everything we pretty much do is with our children. Everything I pretty much do is with my children. I never do any kind of tupperware or such parties because that would take me away from my famliy to be with a bunch of women instead. Not my idea of fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only time I have been away from my children is when I had one and was in the hospital, spent the night out briefly 2 Valentines days ago and went to Chicago for Oprah with Tara. In 9 years, that&#39;s the extent of my away from the children time. I get my grown up talk when my children meet with others and I have their moms to talk with. I have this list that gets read when the kids are eating or like right now, totally into playing with their hermit crabs. I also stay up until 2 a.m. so I have plenty of time then to read the news and check out this list or anything else on the web I&#39;m searching for. I get an occasional magazine to read once in awhile but mostly the new issue is out before I&#39;ve read the old one. I do vedge with my husband and a tv show every so often but that&#39;s totally with the children either watching with us or coming back and forth to interact. Movies that we only want to watch alone are done after midnight on the weekends when the kids for the most part are alseep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really am happy with the way things are. If our health holds up, my husband and I will have plenty of time when the children won&#39;t want to hang around us all the time. We&#39;ll have our alone time then. I see it already with Tara. And if I got hit by a bus tomorrow, I would have no regrets at all as to how I parent. <br/>\n<br/>\nMary B <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I have <br/>\nseven children, 12, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1, and 7 months.  It takes me about 3 hours, <br/>\noff and on just to read all the mail from this list, not to mention the few <br/>\nothers I&#39;m on!  I also heavily pursue MY interests and I don&#39;t feel my <br/>\nchildren are the slightest neglected!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the first trick is having a childproof home.  Read that SAFE!<br/>\nI make sure nothing is within reach that may harm my children or make my <br/>\nlife difficult.  I keep a safety lock on the fridge so my 2 yr old doesn&#39;t <br/>\nempty it out on the floor.  My older children can all open it (4 and up) if <br/>\nthey need something.  Last night, I left it unlocked and Ethan (2) dumped 5 <br/>\nlittle tubs of yogurt on the kitchen floor.  It took about 5 minutes to <br/>\nclean it up, throw away the trash and spot mop the floor.  No big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been up since about 7:30 this morning.  It&#39;s 10:45 now.  I nursed the <br/>\nbaby, had a potty break and sat all the kids down for breakfast.  While they <br/>\nate, I threw a load of laundry in the wash, put the wet ones in the dryer, <br/>\ncleaned up Ethan&#39;s mess, checked a portion of my email and kissed hubby off <br/>\nto work.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the kids finished breaskfast, the little ones (1,2, and 4) went into <br/>\nthe bathtub while I cleaned the bathroom and got dressed.  The baby played <br/>\nin the living room floor while her big sisters watched tv.  Once the little <br/>\nones got out of the tub, I got them dressed and they headed outside to play. <br/>\n  Baby nursed again and I read for about 15 minutes (one of my passions.)  I <br/>\nput her in the sling, pulled out dinner to thaw, set out the side dishes and <br/>\nstarted a load of dishes in the dishwasher.  My 1 yr old came in and helped <br/>\nme empty the dryer...HIS passion &lt;bg&gt;.  The girls came in to help me fold <br/>\nand my oldest daughter threw the wet clothes into the dryer and started a <br/>\nnew load.  After folding laundry, we read a book together while baby nursed <br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids have come in and are playing in the playroom.  I&#39;m back checking <br/>\nemail again.  We have rehearsals for the talent show our local support group <br/>\nis putting on at 1 this afternoon.  I guess after checking email, I&#39;ll get <br/>\nthe kids ready to go (all their clothes, shoes, socks, bows, etc. were laid <br/>\nout last night after they went to bed) make any last minute wardrobe <br/>\nchanges...bound to happen with my 6 yr old!...and the kids will most likely <br/>\nkeep playing in or outside.  All this time, the baby is in the sling, <br/>\nplaying happily on the floor or following me around in her carseat since she <br/>\nlikes to sit up but hasn&#39;t yet mastered it completely on her own.  I think I <br/>\nmay use the remainder of that time to pack lunches for the park and convert <br/>\na regular bra I bought last night into a nursing bra.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize this is long, but I just wanted to give you a taste of my short <br/>\nmorning.  I&#39;ve had plenty of time to pursue my interests but I do it in <br/>\nspurts.  I also clean and do just about everything else in spurts.  If I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t plan ahead it would take me 2 hours to get the kids dressed and ready <br/>\nto go.  Instead,I spend about 15 minutes after they head to bed to find <br/>\neverything we will need for the next day.  I HIGHLY recommend FlyLady to <br/>\nhelp you get organized.  It&#39;s for your home, but somehow it clears up your <br/>\nhead, too!<br/>\n<br/>\nI also don&#39;t spend all day hovering over my kids.  I&#39;m not saying you do, <br/>\nbut it sounds like you feel very taxed.  One thing that helps is to allow <br/>\nthe kids to be independant.  Kids love to do things for themselves.  <br/>\nSometimes, it&#39;s hard to let them make their own lunch, for example.  You <br/>\nfear the mess, etc.  Really, it doesn&#39;t take long to clean up any messes <br/>\nthey might not be able to do themselves.  When my kids want to make <br/>\nthemselves lunch (usually a pb&j and fruit) I help them get what they need <br/>\nand give them a wet wash cloth.  They are very good about wiping up any <br/>\nspills and feel so proud when they *cook* all by themselves :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust relax and let your kids take up a litle slack where they might enjoy <br/>\ndoing so.  It also helps to accept the fact that most home/unschoolers <br/>\n*don&#39;t* have a clean house.  Strive for picked up and clean at night or on <br/>\nthe weekends.  Or in Spurts!  It is possible!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this blabber helped in some way! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] moms doing what they want","postDate":"1051715178","msgId":66827,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4YS4xOTQ3MmJkZC4yYmUxNDA2YUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66815,"nextInTopic":66831,"prevInTime":66826,"nextInTime":66828,"topicId":66815,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Is loving and nurturing one s family full time not a life?-=- Sure.

But part of the nurturing unschoolers need is intellectual nurturing.<br/>\nAn unschooling family in which the mom isn&#39;t interested in anything but <br/>\nhousework is at a disadvantage.  And if taking care of kids is seen in the <br/>\nhousework category (keep them clean and cleaned up after), things will bog <br/>\ndown.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were all little I went weeks without doing anything that wasn&#39;t <br/>\nkid-related sometimes, but it was still colored toward things I enjoyed.  <br/>\nMusic.  Games.  Going out to parks and showing them things I thought were <br/>\ncool.   Showing them movies I liked too, and learning to like Power Rangers <br/>\nand Ninja Turtles  (modern equivalents abound, but I don&#39;t know much about <br/>\nthem &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs they get older they want to know more about the width and breadth and <br/>\ndepth of the world and it&#39;s good when moms don&#39;t just say &quot;Would you like a <br/>\nsandwich instead?&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome moms see being with their kids as drudgery or as sacrifice.  I saw it as <br/>\nlearning something new and fascinating, as trying to figure out how kids saw <br/>\nthe world as they were learning to talk, and how they figured out math and <br/>\ngeography (what direction things were from our house) and I loved their early <br/>\ntheories on how big the world is.   (&quot;There must be thousands of people in <br/>\nthe world!&quot;)  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo lots of it&#39;s in how things are defined in our own heads, and that can be a <br/>\npart of deschooling ourselves.   It was gradual (though speedily gradual, <br/>\ncompared to some, it seems) that I came to see non-academic stuff as just as <br/>\nvaluable, and eventually as just as &quot;academic&quot; as the obviously school-style <br/>\nstuff.  But learning that was something I had chosen to do, because school <br/>\nwas just a few blocks away and I did have a choice.  So I chose to homeschool <br/>\nand unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were little I chose to organize and maintain a weekly playgroup. <br/>\n  It wasn&#39;t just for me, it was community service, and network-creation, and <br/>\nsomething for the kids to look foward to and a place to use balls and <br/>\njumpropes that took more than two kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen that&#39;s not enough, the mom needs to be at least mentally ready to widen <br/>\nand branch out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems the only time anyone says a mom needs to have her own interests is <br/>\nright after a mom says she can&#39;t see her kids getting interested in anything, <br/>\nbut then she herself isn&#39;t interested in anything, and so someone will say <br/>\n&quot;Get interested in things.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo talk about Power Rangers I shared some of what I knew about Japan and <br/>\nmovie making and costuming and traditions about folklore, storytelling and <br/>\nspace fantasy.  Monsters from space.  (Eddie Izzard talks about monsters from <br/>\nspace, how long we&#39;ve been ready for them, and that&#39;s a Power Rangers tie in. <br/>\n And I&#39;ve been reading to Holly from a series of books called The Children&#39;s <br/>\nHour, which I got when I was tiny, published in 1954, and we&#39;re on the <br/>\nScience Fiction and Space Flight stuff.  VERY crude.  But monsters on Mars <br/>\nfeatures.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf all I wanted to do was travel to the north pole or sky dive, I could be <br/>\nmiserable, or I could just go do it and not care if my kids were miserable.  <br/>\nBut within my choice to be with my kids I can still choose what music to <br/>\nlisten to, what trips to go on when Keith says &quot;in-laws or camping?&quot; and I <br/>\ncan go out with friends and we choose each time from thousands of choices, <br/>\nwhether to go bowling or to an art flick or to a concert or shop or just go <br/>\npark out on the mesa and watch the sun set and catch up with each other&#39;s <br/>\nlives.  For a while  a friend and I was going to one of the pottery painting <br/>\nplaces and doing home-stuff.  A teapot as a joint gift for a friend.  <br/>\nSwitchplates with indicators, for my house, of which thing they turned on.  <br/>\nWeird combos.  And we talked.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoms can trade with other families, or leave kids with dads, and go.  An <br/>\nhour, a half an hour, might be all it takes to reconnect with an interest the <br/>\nkids don&#39;t share (yet).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"Sheila","from":"&quot;Sheila&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"moms doing what they want","postDate":"1051708118","msgId":66815,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZTgwMWMzMGYxOSQ5ZDY4ZGM4MCQxNTAyYThjMEBXb3JrR3JvdXA+","referencesHeader":"PDEwNTE2MjIyNTYuMjExMC4zNjExNC5tOEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":66827,"prevInTime":66814,"nextInTime":66816,"topicId":66815,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think to unschool effectively means that we parents have to have lives and interests.

We","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-177099062\">&quot;I think to unschool effectively means that we parents have to have lives<br/>\nand<br/>\ninterests. We have to have a passion for learning stuff, to like to do<br/>\nstuff.<br/>\nWe CAN&#39;T just do it for the kids. Then it becomes a sacrifice, which IS<br/>\nabout<br/>\nus. Kids don&#39;t want us to sacrifice ourselves...that&#39;s leads to guilt. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most I have time to do something of interest to myself is reading this<br/>\nand one other list.  I usually feel guilty about the time spent doing that,<br/>\nbecause while I&#39;m doing it the kids are feeling neglected or the house is<br/>\nbeing trashed.  I often can&#39;t read all the posts and have to skip a whole<br/>\nbunch of them  because I don&#39;t have time to both unschool my kids and read<br/>\nabout unschooling.  How in the world would I have time to pursue my own<br/>\ninterests?  Today I have to go to the grocery store, make sandwiches for my<br/>\n9 year old daughter&#39;s tea party she&#39;s having with friends, help my 5 year<br/>\nold son look for a set of blocks he wants to find, make supper, take dd to<br/>\nsoccer practice. There won&#39;t be much time leftover.   I have 10 more minutes<br/>\nto read this list and then that&#39;s IT.  And even as I&#39;m writing this, my 3<br/>\nyear old just started saying, &quot;Mommy, come play Thomas with me&quot;.  There is<br/>\nno time for interests of my own.  Unless you count watching my kids learn<br/>\nand grow as my passion.  And it really is!  It&#39;s one of the most fascinating<br/>\nthings I can think to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes read interesting books and magazines (mostly about unschooling<br/>\nor parenting).  Sometimes I&#39;ll research a little bit about traditions and<br/>\nwhy people do the things they do.  That&#39;s about the extent of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said:<br/>\n&quot;So, reading the above... I was a bit baffled. Sure, there&#39;s nothing wrong<br/>\nwith buying the brand of toilet paper your family likes -- but why are you<br/>\nthe only one who replaces the roll? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe she&#39;s the only one who will?  Maybe the kids don&#39;t want to?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s not that it isn&#39;t fine for you to have a couple of &quot;Lovey Nurturey&quot;<br/>\nthings you do for your family, but the impression I get is that these are<br/>\njust the tip of the iceberg. I think the first thing you need to do is to<br/>\nGet<br/>\na Life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs loving and nurturing one&#39;s family full time not a life?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What<br/>\nhave YOU always wanted to learn or do?  What are YOUR dreams? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always wanted to be a mommy, ever since I&#39;ve been little.    I used to<br/>\nhave 14 dolls and each had a name.  I always told my mom that I would have<br/>\n14 kids when I got big and that I would name them the same name as my dolls.<br/>\nI dreamed about being a real mommy.  I met my husband when I was 15 and as<br/>\nsoon as I met him, I dreamed about becoming his wife.  He became my passion<br/>\nand at 18 I married him.  So my passion is my husband and kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So, I think maybe you DO need to do stuff that&#39;s about YOU, but not having<br/>\nto<br/>\ndo with your kids.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou must be talking to parents of older kids here.  It must be that older<br/>\nkids require a whole lot less of your time.  Because I don&#39;t have time to do<br/>\nstuff that&#39;s about me, except right now and what I&#39;m doing is talking about<br/>\nmy kids! lol   And I&#39;m not a keep the house spotless fanatic.  Far from it!<br/>\nJust playing with my kids and keeping them fed requires me to busy with them<br/>\n24/7.  If I pursued my own interests, I would be neglecting my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67370,"nextTopicId":67092}}
