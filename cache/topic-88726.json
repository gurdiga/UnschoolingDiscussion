You sound like such a wonderful mother and woman, and I am so sorry for your family&#39;s loss. <br/>\n<br/>\nI read Sandra&#39;s post yesterday, and my heart went out to you. Later as my kids and I were playing outside, my Sam (3.5) went into our fish pond trying to break the ice on it. He only went in up to his waist, but I thought of you and what you must have gone through as my girls and I ran him inside, got him warm and put him by the woodstove. My whole soul mourns for you, Joanna! <br/>\n<br/>\nYou and your family sound so strong and courageous and loving. You are an inspiration as you have found strategies to continue to incorporate your Sam into your lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\ndanielle<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":6770123,"authorName":"BonKnit@aol.com","from":"BonKnit@...","profile":"pampmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[UnschoolingDiscussion] Joanna","postDate":"1074016333","msgId":88726,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQyLjJmY2NlZDUuMmQzNThhNGRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":88900,"prevInTime":88725,"nextInTime":88727,"topicId":88726,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am so sorry to hear of your loss, my heart goes out to you.
