My opinion on spanking is still the same and has nothing to do with<br/>\n&gt; whatever you wrote initially.

I still believe<br/>\n&gt; spanking is abusive and if you don&#39;t that&#39;s ok, that&#39;s what you are<br/>\n&gt; comfortable with.  However I notice you spend a lot of time defending<br/>\n&gt; it and being outraged that other people think spanking is abusive.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s life... People in this world seem to all have differing<br/>\n&gt; opinions about things and just because they don&#39;t jive with yours<br/>\n&gt; does not mean they are offensive, rude or whatever you want to call<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Shirley says:<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the outrage that you noticed came more from being jumped on so<br/>\nseverely for holding a view that contrasted with those of others on this<br/>\nlist. In other words, it was a REACTION to the reactions of others. It&#39;s<br/>\nhuman nature that when we feel attacked, we will suually return the favor,<br/>\nespecially if we feel blindsided, which may have well been the case with the<br/>\nauthor of the original post. After all, after having seen any number of<br/>\nposts on any number of wide ranging topics, she felt free to bring a concern<br/>\nto the table, so tospeak. And promptly got stomped on. Repeatedly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it happens , I don&#39;t agree with her views on spanking, but I don&#39;t agree<br/>\nwith some of the venom that has been slung in her direction either. A little<br/>\nmore civility and a little less self-righteousness would be a real nice<br/>\naddition to the discussion right about now.
