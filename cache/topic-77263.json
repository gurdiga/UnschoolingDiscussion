But <br/>\nremember, the modeling schools are businesses...the more classes you take from them, <br/>\nthe more money they will make.  They&#39;ll tell anyone they have a shot at <br/>\nbecoming a real model to get them in the door and charge hundreds of dollars to put <br/>\ntogether a portfolio.  A lot of what modeling schools teach are somewhat <br/>\noutdated too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all honesty, if someone &quot;has it&quot; (the look a reputable agency is looking <br/>\nfor) the agency itself will &quot;teach&quot; the child/adult how to stand, pose, etc. <br/>\nonce they sign them on.  I knew a couple of kids growing up that professionally <br/>\nmodeled and were in commercials.  None of them went to a modeling school but <br/>\ninstead took ballet or some sort of dance class to help with poise, grace, and <br/>\nposture.  A couple also took acting classes and were in drama at school.  They <br/>\nwere told often as kids how photogenic they were and that they should model, <br/>\nso their parents spent a hefty amount of money getting pictures done by a <br/>\nphotographer that KNOWS what he&#39;s doing (you&#39;d need to find one that knows how to <br/>\nput a portfolio together and has done it for a while) and they sent one or 2 <br/>\npages of photos to real agencies and just waited.  One girls parents hired an <br/>\nagent (they had money to burn) and that helped her get her foot in the door.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I&#39;d stay away from the modeling schools and instead go for dance <br/>\nor some sort of theater club/class.  If you know someone that models <br/>\nprofessionally, ask to see his/her portfolio.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77253,"nextTopicId":77276}}
