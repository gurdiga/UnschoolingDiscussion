We are in Hampton.  Where are <br/>\nyou?  We haven&#39;t really looked into a group, most I have heard of in the area <br/>\n(VA Beach, Norfolk, Etc.) are homeschoolers but I never hear much about <br/>\nunschooling.  There have been several outings but they are during his school hours, so <br/>\nI haven&#39;t gone.  I guess I am so stuck on the decision to pull him out or let <br/>\nhim finish that I have been holding off on participating in anything because <br/>\nI don&#39;t want to &quot;intrude&quot;.  I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m able to be a part of that world <br/>\nuntil the decision is made.  You can email me off the list, I&#39;d appreciate <br/>\nanything because I don&#39;t even know all the right questions to ask.
