It&#39;s absence doesn&#39;t effect what I want and expect<br/>\nfrom life. So it&#39;s certainly not a universal &quot;HAS to&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe what you mean is you really want there to be more because you find the<br/>\nthought that there isn&#39;t more disturbing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think there is overwhelming evidence that<br/>\n&gt; suggests <br/>\n&gt; there are reasons for living other than simple existence due to no &quot;higher&quot;<br/>\n&gt; power or &quot;plan&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the evidence were overwhelming then it would be as accepted as gravity.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere in the US it seems more people *do* believe in some greater power or<br/>\nplan than don&#39;t. It&#39;s easy to extrapolte from the fact that most people<br/>\nbelieve there is something more to the conclusion that there must therefore<br/>\nbe something more. All that belief must mean there&#39;s *something*. There was<br/>\nNewsweek article &quot;Religion and the Brain&quot; Newsweek May 7, 2001 which I wish<br/>\nI&#39;d read but I suspect from what I&#39;ve read about it that it discusses that<br/>\nvery thing: that the answers we come up with for The Reason For It All speak<br/>\nmore to a universal need in our brains for answers rather than to there<br/>\nactually being something there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re pattern loving creatures. We seek pattern in chaos. We can&#39;t help it.<br/>\nAnd we *do* find plenty of patterns in nature and that&#39;s why we have science<br/>\nand literature and art and so on. But it also causes us to be unsettled when<br/>\nchaos is just chaos. We keep striving to find the pattern in it, and that, I<br/>\nthink, leads to a belief in higher powers and higher plans.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is all there is, nothing more, so what<br/>\n&gt; does it matter in the grand scheme of life who we impact in this world or what<br/>\n&gt; we do really?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just wanting and needing something doesn&#39;t make it so. The laws of physics<br/>\ndon&#39;t care what we want spiritually ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Put out all the negative energy you want, doesn&#39;t affect<br/>\n&gt; life... I don&#39;t buy that idea either.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But negative energy does effect life. If we act selfishly, we&#39;re likely to<br/>\nbe responded to selfishly.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing negative and unkind makes a difference to us, to those around us and<br/>\nto the environment we create around us. The kinder and more thoughtful and<br/>\njoyful we are, the nicer people are to us and the nicer our little pocket of<br/>\nsociety is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe get back what we give but we shouldn&#39;t give with that expectation. We<br/>\nshould help because the reward comes from the doing and the helping not<br/>\nbecause we need some return.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe words are pretty inadequate!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we&#39;re giving and no one wants the gift, then we&#39;re wasting our time. If<br/>\nwe&#39;re giving and *expecting* appreciation then we&#39;re likely to be<br/>\ndisappointed. (Though there&#39;s nothing wrong with reminding people if it<br/>\nfeels like they&#39;re taking what&#39;s given to them for granted.)

So they need to be kept away from the rest of society.

So if I hear voices from God that tell me to murder people, that&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;cool&quot; by you? If my beliefs lead me to believe that it&#39;s a mandate from God<br/>\nthat I swat my children for sinful behavior with an appropriately sized<br/>\ndowel chosen from a chart by age, then that&#39;s cool too?<br/>\n<br/>\n***Actually, yes. Though the human part of me may not like it, the spiritual <br/>\npart of my beliefs, would mandate that while on Earth, what you put out, you <br/>\nget back, but even that is only at the human level. Therefore, my disdain for <br/>\nsomething at the human level is not the same as my ability to accept even the <br/>\nhorrors of this life at my spirit level. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me at soul level, there exist no good or bad, while at the human level <br/>\nthere is plenty of both. And while I understand that conceptually it may be <br/>\ndifficult to accept by those who don&#39;t believe that, for me, I strive to classify <br/>\nwhich things in this life are my lessons and what they mean, even the most <br/>\nhorrifc events. I think there has to be a reason for everything. I don&#39;t claim to <br/>\n&quot;know&quot; what that reason is, but I don&#39;t understand how there would be good if <br/>\nthere were no bad. So, in essence, experiencing both good and bad is <br/>\nsomething my soul chose to do.  For me, that would include the best of the best and <br/>\nthe worsed of the worsed. It goes back to the beliefs of lessons and desire to <br/>\nhave them while we are here. For me, everything beyond humanity belongs to a <br/>\ngreater existence. An existence that dosen&#39;t deal in good or bad. For I see <br/>\nthose as earth bound concepts. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I assume you mean is that you are raising<br/>\nyour daughters in a moral atmosphere where murdering, stealing and generally<br/>\nbeing hurtful are not good options. So, as long as their spirituality<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t cross those moral lines, then whatever they believe is cool with<br/>\nyou. Yes?<br/>\n<br/>\n*** No. I can only choose to share how important it is to put positive out so <br/>\nthat they receive positive back while they exist here. On the human level I <br/>\nwant their existence to be full of positive energy. I, like Judie, believe that <br/>\nwe contracted to experience specific events together on Earth. Therefore, the <br/>\nevents that we chose to experience, even the bad ones, were predetermined. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t say that in order to discount the tragedies we have in this life, nor to <br/>\nbe hurtful to those who have experienced tragedies. The humanity in me weeps <br/>\nfor the pain in this world, but the spiritual part of me knows that those <br/>\nevents happened for a reason. The outcomes and circumstances we experience in the <br/>\ninterim of those events, are where free-will is utilzed. So for my daughters, <br/>\nwhile I cannot change the &quot;events&quot; they contracted to experience, I can give <br/>\nthem tools by which they can exercise their free will with positive energy <br/>\nbetween those events.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of people will look at what you said and what I said and think &quot;Well,<br/>\n*obviously* that&#39;s what she meant.

Because had you <br/>\nnot asked, you&#39;d be under the wrong assumptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, I have a question to throw out there.

I guess I don&#39;t know what<br/>\nyou mean by &#39;get their religious urges&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a Trekkie in the sense that I admire the shows as reborn in the 80s<br/>\n(in fact, they are the only TV shows I watch). I admire the values,<br/>\nissues, conflicts, etc they illustrate, but I don&#39;t go to conventions<br/>\nand/or identify with characters beyond merely enjoying their<br/>\nperformances.  One of the best books around is _The Metaphysics of Star<br/>\nTrek_.  I also greatly enjoy the Star Wars movies.  And I love _The Lord<br/>\nof the Rings_, though I think the movies are disappointing.  I don&#39;t get<br/>\nmy religious urges from any of these, books or movies/TV shows, but they<br/>\ndo reflect many of my deeply-held values, which makes them more<br/>\nenjoyable to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Should literature serve as someone&#39;s strongly held beliefs?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure I know what you mean here, either, but surely the Bible and<br/>\nKoran are examples of literature providing religious beliefs, or<br/>\nunderlying those beliefs?  Going back to Bach&#39;s writing, his beliefs as<br/>\nexpressed in the books are not a religion.  But they have helped me<br/>\nchallenge the more or less Christian cultural upbringing I had, and<br/>\nthink more deeply about matters philosophical/religious/spiritual than I<br/>\nmight have otherwise.  His books don&#39;t &#39;serve as my beliefs&#39;.  His books<br/>\nsimply helped me clarify where I stand, what I believe about myself, my<br/>\nexistence after this life, etc.  Another person might take the books<br/>\nmore literally, and build a &#39;religion&#39; around them.  That&#39;s not my<br/>\nchoice, but who am I to deny that person his/her choice?<br/>\n  <br/>\n&lt;&lt;Should we treat the beliefs of a Trek-fan trekker/trekkie/trekoid) who<br/>\nhas read the Bible in Klingon and drinks blood and prune juice as<br/>\nreverently as we treat those of a hard-working, sincerely believing<br/>\nCatholic nun?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone suggested treating another&#39;s beliefs with<br/>\n&#39;reverence&#39;.  The Holly I mentioned above once told me that if I didn&#39;t<br/>\ngo to HER church--not merely her sect, but her specific church building<br/>\nwith her particular minister--that I would go to hell.  I don&#39;t regard<br/>\nsuch a belief with reverence by any means--in fact, I laughed at the<br/>\ntime, and laugh every time I remember the incident :)  Though at the<br/>\nsame time I feel slightly saddened that she&#39;s chosen such a narrow way<br/>\nto view the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I respect that she has a right to her beliefs, as long as she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t act on them in a way that harms me (my physical self--no one can<br/>\nharm my spiritual self) or others I am responsible for.  If she does,<br/>\nthen I walk away.  If she follows, I take whatever steps I need to, to<br/>\nprotect myself and my loved ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the real issue here is an assumption that I, or anyone else,<br/>\nwould believe *all* beliefs are equally valid, equally worthy of respect<br/>\nor &#39;reverence&#39;.  I can&#39;t speak for anyone else, but for myself, of<br/>\ncourse I don&#39;t believe all beliefs are equally valid :)  If I did, I&#39;d<br/>\nbe in a right quandary, wondering whether the other Holly was right that<br/>\nI was going to hell.  Against that, I&#39;d have to place another person&#39;s<br/>\nbeliefs--that person told me I was going to heaven whether I liked it or<br/>\nnot because at one point I was baptized.  Talk about a rock and a hard<br/>\nplace, particularly since I believe neither in heaven nor hell :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal point of view is that I have respect--even to those who harm<br/>\nme--for the PERSON.  I don&#39;t have to respect the motivations, beliefs,<br/>\nor actions and yet be able to respect the person.  By respect I mean<br/>\nthat I (do my best) to accept others where they are in their lives;<br/>\naccept that they are doing the best they can in any given set of<br/>\ncircumstances; accept that their beliefs are different from my own;<br/>\naccept that they, like me, in spite of appearances, are part of the Tao;<br/>\nand accept the fact that sometimes the intersections of our lives will<br/>\nbe painful, while othertimes will be rewarding.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I accept your hypothetical Trekkie exactly as I accept your<br/>\nhypothetical nun exactly as I accept Judie exactly as I accept you.  We<br/>\nare all traveling in this physical life for a time, all struggling to<br/>\nmake sense of the inherent conflict between the &#39;reality&#39; we see and the<br/>\nReality we sense or remember, each of us groping toward a deeper<br/>\nunderstanding of what physical life is all about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question becomes, how judgmental do we need to be of each other on<br/>\nthis journey?  Does it help us each along, or hinder us?  Ultimately,<br/>\nhow much does it matter?  My physical self believes it matters a lot, my<br/>\nspiritual self knows we are all &#39;dust in the wind&#39; and it matters not<br/>\none whit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so the see-saw of life keeps teetering &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] literature as religion","postDate":"1064319194","msgId":81267,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCOTVCMTFBLjFFQ0IzJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY3LjE4ZmZlNTY2LjJjYTA5YzY3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":81231,"nextInTopic":81284,"prevInTime":81266,"nextInTime":81268,"topicId":81218,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That&#39;s what the list is for.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur beliefs, as Pam succinctly put it (but I can&#39;t find it now) and I took a<br/>\nhuge post saying ;-) are what we use to decide what are good and bad<br/>\nchoices. Part of the purpose of the list is to help people figure out how to<br/>\nmake the choices that will get them to unschooling and more joyful lives<br/>\nwith their families. And part of that process is examining the beliefs<br/>\npeople are using to filter their choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut even on a larger scale, do you really mean &quot;whatever floats a person&#39;s<br/>\nboat&quot;? So if I hear voices from God that tell me to murder people, that&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;cool&quot; by you? If my beliefs lead me to believe that it&#39;s a mandate from God<br/>\nthat I swat my children for sinful behavior with an appropriately sized<br/>\ndowel chosen from a chart by age, then that&#39;s cool too?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;Mom, is there a wrong way to believe?

What I assume you mean is that you are raising<br/>\nyour daughters in a moral atmosphere where murdering, stealing and generally<br/>\nbeing hurtful are not good options. So, as long as their spirituality<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t cross those moral lines, then whatever they believe is cool with<br/>\nyou. Yes?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of people will look at what you said and what I said and think &quot;Well,<br/>\n*obviously* that&#39;s what she meant. And it&#39;s nitpicky to even question it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a list where the only tool we have to get our ideas across are the words<br/>\nwe use, those words are very important. If we were talking about things we<br/>\nwere all well familiar with, like how to nurse a baby, then we could rely on<br/>\npeople filling in the gaps of where our words weren&#39;t quite right. But the<br/>\nlist isn&#39;t about familiar things. It&#39;s very often about ideas that many<br/>\npeople have never contemplated before. So the words we use need to<br/>\naccurately convey what we&#39;re thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I definitely disagree and say there are wrong ways to believe -- wrong<br/>\nfor helping people get to unschooling, and wrong for a peaceful society of<br/>\ndiffering beliefs.

My beliefs were in place long before I ever read the <br/>\nbook. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra wrote:<br/>\nShould literature serve as someone&#39;s strongly held beliefs?<br/>\n<br/>\n***I can&#39;t say whether literature alone can lead one to religion, whatever <br/>\nreligion they may claim. Many people use the written words of the bible, the <br/>\nquoran, the torah, to support their choices in religions. But for me they could <br/>\nbe considered literature with good stories, just like &quot;Illusions&quot;. I don&#39;t <br/>\nprescribe to any of the religions that people often base their faiths on those <br/>\nbooks. Then again, I don&#39;t really claim to have a religion. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust like many other things in life, people get stuck in labels. For many <br/>\nyears I said I was a Gnostic Christian. It is kind of like when you say you&#39;re a <br/>\nhomeschooler, even though you know you don&#39;t school at home or school at all. <br/>\nIt&#39;s a label that can sometimes eleviate any questions you aren&#39;t up to <br/>\nanswering. In a group of Christians, all they needed to hear was that word and <br/>\nlittle was asked about my beliefs from that point on. It wasn&#39;t untrue, it just <br/>\nwasn&#39;t as cut and dry as they may have preferred it to be. On the occasions that <br/>\nsomeone would actually ask me what Gnostic meant, I&#39;d cut that definition <br/>\nshort also, depending on how much I knew about their own belief system or <br/>\nreligion. If they seemed interested or asked for more detailed information, I would <br/>\nhappily share. Now, I don&#39;t really call myself anything when asked what religion <br/>\nI am. I usually say I don&#39;t have a religion and somehow that always jumps the <br/>\nasker to the conclusion that I am an Atheist. Back to labels we go. Sometimes <br/>\nI&#39;ll explain, sometimes I&#39;m not in the mood, sometimes I don&#39;t care, just <br/>\ndepends. <br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, to each their own. If being a trekkie (and whatever that may <br/>\nencompass) floats a persons boat, then cool by me.  It&#39;s about them and not about me. <br/>\nThe twins asked the other day, when a friend of theirs was asking them about <br/>\nbeing &quot;saved&quot;, &quot;Mom, is there a wrong way to believe? And how do you know when <br/>\nyou are right?&quot;  My explaination to them was, &quot;Well, to me there is no wrong <br/>\nabout faith/philosophy/religion/beliefs. It&#39;s something personal, so personal <br/>\nthat I don&#39;t know any two people that agree on all of it. It&#39;s also something <br/>\nearthly, so it&#39;s a concern of this plane. There are lots of groups of people <br/>\nwho see somethings similarly, enough to congregate, you know get together, and <br/>\nthey share many things based on having those things in common. As for knowing <br/>\nwho&#39;s right, I don&#39;t. But I don&#39;t think anyone else does. It&#39;s all about what <br/>\nfeels right to you, you have to choose. You may choose something totally <br/>\ndifferent than me, the way I have different beliefs than Grammy. All that I really <br/>\nneed you to always know, is that no matter what you choose, you will always be <br/>\nmy babies, I will always love you and I hope I never ask you to change those <br/>\nbeliefs for me.
