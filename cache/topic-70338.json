So I worried about it with my kids.  Especially when we decided to let them decide on what they wanted to eat or drink.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We started this type of thinking about a year ago and its been fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n  At first my ds (10) would drink Mountain Dew all the time.  After about a month or so he decided that he would have a soda a day,  (sometimes its 2, sometimes its none).   He hardly ever has Mountain Dew anymore, usually its Sprite.  I just said to him that he could have it if he wants it,  told him what was in it,  we talked about it not replenishing his body (if there&#39;s caffeine in it) and all that.   Then I left him alone.   <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n  Does your son get signals from anyone that his choice to have soda isn&#39;t the &#39;right&#39; choice?    I know for me if there&#39;s anyone around who thinks what I&#39;m doing is bad or wrong, I&#39;ll do it even more.   (I&#39;m not saying you are doing this but maybe there&#39;s someone else around?)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know sometimes my youngest would make some really off the wall requests at wierd times just to test me and when I&#39;d say sure, she&#39;d decide she didn&#39;t want it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I know I went through a phase of drinking a lot of Coke,  but now I don&#39;t drink any at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I bet it will pass.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kelli~    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
