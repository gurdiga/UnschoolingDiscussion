After a LOT","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-359918935\">-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Teri Kuiper, Usborne Books &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:usborne@...\">usborne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conference is listed as being Sept 6-10.  Is it 5 days next time?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\nOK.<br/>\n <br/>\nAfter a LOT of thought---and suggestions from past attendees, we have decided to extend the conference <br/>\n*just* a bit. The plan this year is to have an ice cream social on Wednesday night before the <br/>\nstart of the conference on Thursday morning. It will be at the hotel (outside) and will be a time to meet <br/>\nthe speakers and funshop presenters, the vendors, and others from your own &quot;neck of the woods&quot; as well as<br/>\nto put faces with cyber-names.<br/>\n <br/>\nTHis will also allow us to start a bit earlier on Thursday. We will also offer shorter funshops more than <br/>\nonce. The Talent Show will again be two nights, Thursday and Friday. <br/>\n <br/>\nSaturday night we will have a sit-down supper with New Mexican cuisine (I love local flavor! &lt;g&gt;),<br/>\nwith a small &quot;Dinner Show&quot; while we eat, followed by a dance for everyone. This supper WILL cost extra <br/>\nthough! It will be a buffet of New Mexican dishes, and there will be a different price for the younger<br/>\nset. We will try to make it as reasonable as possible so that everyone can attend.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;re hoping that the Ice Cream Social and the Dinner & Dance will be the social aspect that everyone <br/>\nseemed to be craving last year---a chance to sit and *connect* with other unschoolers. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;ll let out early enough on Sunday that you and your families can enjoy some of Albuquerque&#39;s *very* <br/>\nnearby (within walking distance) sights before we meet in a park for our closing picnic.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m still open to other ideas (although there are NO promises! &lt;G&gt;) for making the conference more <br/>\nunschooly. Thanks to everyone who has sent in comments and recommendations. <br/>\n <br/>\n~KellyKelly LovejoyConference CoordinatorLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23505,"nextTopicId":23458}}
