We were right on the bay <br/>\nand it was a wildlife haven. We dealt with snakes regularly. Mostly non <br/>\npoisonus, but also a couple of water moccasins and a pygmy rattler.<br/>\nI also saw poisonus ones while hiking.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that we live in town, I NEVER see snakes. Which surprised me at first, <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s very wooded behind our house and there is a marsh/pond area and <br/>\na creek that empties into the bay. All within a stones throw of the house.<br/>\nBut being in town must mean that the snakes that have survived development <br/>\nare more cautious, or there are just a lot less of them. Or maybe both <br/>\nreasons!<br/>\nAnyway, if you live in suburbia, it&#39;s doubtful you&#39;ll have to deal with the <br/>\nslithery guys very often, if ever.  But they live all over Florida, it&#39;s just <br/>\npart of our state.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible <br/>\nspoon;<br/>\nAnd hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>\nmoon.&quot;<br/>\n                                                --The Owl and the Pussycat      <br/>\n                                        Edward Lear</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65864,"nextTopicId":67695}}
