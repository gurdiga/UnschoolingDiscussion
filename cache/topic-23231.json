Is there <br/>\n any thing else I should watch out for when having  a <br/>\n baby in an American hospital?<br/>\n Sigh. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes there are other things you should watch out for.  <br/>\nSome hospitals are giving Hep B vacc right after <br/>\nbirth.  Find out hospital policy about rooming in.<br/>\nYou might want to look into eye drops and Vit K<br/>\nshot.  They may also do the test where they prick<br/>\nthe baby&#39;s foot, can&#39;t think of the name of that, but<br/>\nits really not necessary to do until your milk comes<br/>\nin around 5-7 days after birth I believe (even if your<br/>\nmilk comes in day 3 still wait a few more days).<br/>\nLastly, what I did not know, even though I had<br/>\nsaid breastfeeding, no formula, they managed<br/>\nto slip a bottle of water to my dd. Who would of<br/>\nknown?  I had three planned homebirths, with the<br/>\nfirst I wound up in the hospital after 26 hrs of labor.<br/>\nI had a nurse that I couldn&#39;t stand telling me that<br/>\nI was too loud, telling me that I had to sign the <br/>\nepisiotomy form just in case, to which I said that<br/>\nthe dr. better not cut me and she said that he might<br/>\nhave to and I said he better not do it, as I am <br/>\nrefusing to sign the form. Turns out I dont&#39; tear,<br/>\neven delivering 9 plus # babies.  It was annoying to<br/>\nsay that least to have my child in the hospital.  Being<br/>\na more experienced mom (now) I would never go<br/>\nto the hospital in my circumstances, as there was<br/>\nno emergency, only a tired mama and a sick <br/>\nmidwife who had just gotten home from England <br/>\ntwo days before.  I kept my baby with me as long<br/>\nas I could, never let her go until she started crying<br/>\nin the middle of the night and I couldn&#39;t get her<br/>\nback to sleep. They took her from me (I had no<br/>\none there to care for her at midnight, she had<br/>\nbeen sleeping in my bed with me, I swear I <br/>\ndont&#39; think that anyone knew that). When I<br/>\nwoke at 4 am I demanded my baby back and<br/>\nhave felt guilty ever since (thats when they gave<br/>\nher the water and I only found that out when a<br/>\nnurse accidentally said something about it to<br/>\nme and I had a fit--much to my dh&#39;s dismay--<br/>\nthat she was successfully breastfeeding and did<br/>\nnot need any supplements including water)  that they<br/>\ntook my baby for those four hours she was alone!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra mentioned the birth plan, a great book for<br/>\nputting one of those together is called A Good<br/>\nBirth, A Safe Birth.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23109,"nextTopicId":23151}}
