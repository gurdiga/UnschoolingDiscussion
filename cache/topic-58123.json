Some normal, and some very thin, which we spread <br/>\nwith strawberry cream cheese and rolled up.  Those made lunch-to-go for her <br/>\nand Kirby.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby needed to work at 11:30.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty got up to eat pancakes with us.  The three kids and I ate together; <br/>\nthat&#39;s unusual for breakfast without company or without a morning outing <br/>\nplanned.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly walked to a collectors&#39; store where there&#39;s a homeschooling Harry <br/>\nPotter tournament.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty was up writing something, something about a game.  Designing a <br/>\ncharacter maybe.  He got a phone call from a friend.  They discussed L5R <br/>\n(another game, with a weeks-long tournament which started last week).<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby called for a ride, Marty wanted to go to the shop for L5R, so I <br/>\ndelivered Marty to Active Imagination, picked Kirby up, took Kirby to where <br/>\nHolly is at Collector&#39;s Paradise.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the driving around involved joking and story telling and plans for the <br/>\nrest of the week and weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve talked to my husband twice.  He went to work for the first time in three <br/>\ndays, and isn&#39;t doing so well.  He&#39;s been sick.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve cleaned a tub and a shower, washed the rubber mats and put them on the <br/>\nline so the sunshine can do its thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaundry&#39;s going through bedding of sick folks so they can sweat on clean <br/>\nstuff tonight (Kirby and Keith are sleeping long and hot, which is good for <br/>\nthem).  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the table are some plastic notch-together attribute-things.  They haven&#39;t <br/>\nbeen out for a long time.  Holly and Marty have been making some cool things <br/>\nwith them.  They&#39;re making full 360 degree symmetrical shapes, with patterns <br/>\nin the colors.  That&#39;s math I can&#39;t describe.  Both of them are way into it, <br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s been working on the little triangle puzzle/game where there&#39;s one <br/>\nempty space, you jump marbles over other marbles until there&#39;s only one left. <br/>\n Working it out on paper, she proved the best way to do it.  But now she&#39;s <br/>\ndoing other patterns, trying to see how many she can possibly leave.  The <br/>\nmaximum would be seven.  She&#39;s trying to find a way to leave more than four, <br/>\non purpose and then describe the findings to her dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby has karate at 5:00.  He usually has a weapons class at 6:00 on <br/>\nThursdays but he&#39;s just going to do the first class and come home.  I&#39;ll <br/>\nprobably drive him and read in the car outside for the hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband got home and is messing with the trailer he&#39;s going to take to the <br/>\nEstrella War next week, a big SCA event near Phoenix.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough people are out and about, this is a really quiet day for us.  And at <br/>\n4:00, no telling what all will yet happen.  Marty and I might go out late at <br/>\nnight (11:00 or so) so he can drive the van on some back streets and a big <br/>\nparking lot.  We&#39;ll probably get french fries, as we&#39;re the two potato fans <br/>\nin the family, and go out in the dark somewhere so he can practice turning <br/>\nand parking.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] new to the  list and can you tell me what you did to...","postDate":"1044567950","msgId":58123,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhYy4xMDJlZjRlZS4yYjc0MzE4ZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":58142,"prevInTime":58122,"nextInTime":58124,"topicId":58123,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/6/03 3:42:02 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

I answered E mail while the boys (5 and 8) played on their <br/>\ncomputers.  One is playing Age of Mythology and the other is playing some <br/>\nstar wars game.  Then I read some out loud to both and we got dressed and <br/>\nwent to get groceries.  Oh yes I think somewhere in there one boy had a <br/>\nstrawberry shake and one had some chocolate milk and a peanut butter cup.  <br/>\nGot home and they went downstairs to watch Star Wars and build with LEGOs and <br/>\neat cheese and crackers while I finished some applique work.  Oh yea, and <br/>\nwatch the snow as it has just started to snowing again.  Love that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can  you tell me your definition of unschooling?
