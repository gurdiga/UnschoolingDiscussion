He was always a rebel and <br/>\neven though he had attended everyday, he was still getting a zero <br/>\ngrade average.  I enrolled him his senior year in the ps high school <br/>\nthat I had attended, almost having anxiety attack just walking in the <br/>\nbuilding!  Anyway, his gpa soared to 3.8 and he spent the first month <br/>\nteaching the kids in his shop class that 1/2 was a &quot;half&quot; not <br/>\n&quot;one-twoith&quot;.  He begged me to let him quit.  At that time I had a <br/>\nclient who was desperate for bodies.  I let my son quit, but insisted <br/>\nthat he go to work learning how to pull cables through walls and <br/>\nceilings. He eagerly agreed and eventually decided that he liked the <br/>\nincome. I filed papers with the state of WI indicating that he was now <br/>\nhomeschooled and filed again for his 18th year.  During that time he <br/>\nbought a car and had to get the license, insurance and registration on <br/>\nhis own.  He moved out and learned to pay bills and budget his <br/>\npaychecks and get his own health insurance. He certainly learned many <br/>\nimportant things. On job applications he states that he was <br/>\nhomeschooled and we&#39;ve never had to &quot;prove&quot; anything.  He has since <br/>\nchanged jobs in the same field twice and has bettered himself each <br/>\ntime.  He&#39;s been on his own for five years with six years of job <br/>\nexperience!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to your cousin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTerese in Milwaukee, WI</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tammy Graves","from":"&quot;Tammy Graves&quot; &lt;tgraves@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"mzp3gf2D7TAEui61Kb6bJpwSPmLboEDGg6LoaxgGS3TdwxvYV1rx41EJZDOTamfnpZgmEgvvSLA6Wyt7l1NytDR5MpoQxsdN0oLCfSI","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] I have a new question","postDate":"990562149","msgId":21740,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg1MjU2QTU0LjAwNkY1NDM1LjAwQG5vdGVzLmJhLmhjaWEuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21751,"prevInTime":21739,"nextInTime":21741,"topicId":21740,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Can a ps high school teenager (ok, well now he is 19) who dropped out at 17 become a unschooler?
