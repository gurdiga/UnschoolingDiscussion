He&#39;d been having a GREAT <br/>\ntime unschooling.  Took to it like a fish to water.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing I did was try not to panic, or to show that I was failing, in <br/>\nmy expression.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second thing I did was validate his request.  He had a reason for asking. <br/>\n I just didn&#39;t know yet what that reason was, but I couldn&#39;t jump to any <br/>\nconclusions or make or pass any judgements.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third thing I did was keep my mouth shut about it for several days, until <br/>\nHE wanted to talk about it again. That was hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt turns out that he was feeling two things.  A little lonely, and in need of <br/>\na little structure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe dealt with each of those things individually, and voila&#39;!  No more talk of <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis desire to go back to school wasn&#39;t so much about school as it was about <br/>\nperceived unmet needs.  I needed to help him figure out a way to identify and <br/>\nmeet his own needs.  It turned into a great object lesson for the both of us.  <br/>\nIf I&#39;d run off half-cocked, in a panic and enrolled him right away in school, <br/>\nwhat a disaster that would have been.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84502,"nextTopicId":84571}}
