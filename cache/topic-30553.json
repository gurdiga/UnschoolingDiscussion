I had friends who grew up w/more unschooling type parents and<br/>\nthese kids never learned to set limits for themselves and ended up in bad<br/>\nsituations w/drugs. I also had one friend w/very progressive parents who<br/>\ngave him a lot of freedom growing up and he was one of the most studious,<br/>\nresponsible guys I knew. So there&#39;s no magic formula.

My parents, especially my dad, were extremely controlling. I remember being 14-17 and my parents didn&#39;t let me do ANYTHING. My dad always told me he &quot;knew&quot; if he let me go out and do things, I would get pregnant or get in trouble or do something to embarras him. I was already untrustworthy and guilty before I even had a chance prove myself otherwise. I was (and still am) very resentful of this treatment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my mind, I knew my own standards of behavior, my own morals and ethics. I knew I didn&#39;t want to get pregnant or take drugs. I just wanted freedom. My parent&#39;s treatment of me made me feel very sad and angry. I had to resort to sneaking around. I am still very sneaky, learned it way back then. I remember my dad even opened, read and confiscated some of my private letters I was writing to a friend (who was a boy). I couldn&#39;t even get phone calls. This probably all sounds extreme, and it was, to me. I know you all probably don&#39;t go this far with social limits on your kids, but I have some of the worst memories of that time in my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I finally was given *some* freedom, it was when I was a senior in high school and beyond. I had a small group of friends. I was exposed to sex, drugs, drinking, but because my own beliefs were so strong, I chose to follow a pretty straight and narrow path and not mess myself up. But it wasn&#39;t because of my parents limits when I was a younger teen. That really just made things worse in my mind. I was okay all along, really I was. I felt slighted by my parents because they didn&#39;t trust me. I probably would have appreciated a more open line of communication with them instead of &quot;you&#39;ll do as I say because I said so&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not quite sure yet how I will handle things with my boys (who are 8 & 10) when the time comes, but like everything else I&#39;ve learned, I will try to make their experience with friends, dating, and my trust in them more positive than mine was when I was growing up. <br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   On Wed, 2 Jan 2002 09:45:54 -0500 (EST), Lorraine Goods wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;I had limits placed on me during certain times of my life when I<br/>\n  &gt;really<br/>\n  &gt;don&#39;t think I would have been able to handle the freedom of making<br/>\n  &gt;my own<br/>\n  &gt;choices.

Looking back on these times, I think<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that if<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I had been allowed to engage in such behaviors the results would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have been<br/>\n&gt; &gt;disastrous -- pregnancy, overdose, etc. By the time I got to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;college, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I did start experimenting w/smoking pot, having boyfriends and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;such, I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;much better able to handle it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wow.<br/>\n&gt; ok.<br/>\n&gt; DD does not have limits about drugs, sex and rock and roll. &lt;g&gt; She<br/>\n&gt; *chooses* not to do drugs or become sexually active... I do not have<br/>\n&gt; to tell her not to; it&#39;s all in her value system and what she has<br/>\n&gt; learned from us, her parents. She&#39;s been informed of what happens<br/>\n&gt; when you do either of those things and SHE&#39;s made the decision not to<br/>\n&gt; go that route. Think about it... who, in their right mind would<br/>\n&gt; *choose* to do either of these things if they are given the facts of<br/>\n&gt; the consequences?!  OTOH, some of her friends who *do* have parents<br/>\n&gt; restricting their kids&#39; activities (you have to be in by 10, you will<br/>\n&gt; be severely grounded if we catch you doing &#39;x&#39;, etc) ARE doing all<br/>\n&gt; these things and more!... sneaking at every chance the get.<br/>\n&gt; imo It all comes back to the issue of respecting your child...<br/>\n&gt; respecting them to have the sense to *make* the right decisions. That<br/>\n&gt; begins when they are little, not later in life.  I doubt my kid will<br/>\n&gt; experiment with drugs when she goes to college.. a time when, as you<br/>\n&gt; put it she&#39;ll be &quot;better able to handle it&quot;. I think she&#39;s learned<br/>\n&gt; long before college age that drugs and irresponsible sex are<br/>\n&gt; dangerous endeavors to pursue.<br/>\n&gt; When I talk to her and we&#39;re discussing what some of her friends are<br/>\n&gt; doing, she refers to their behavior as &quot;dumb&quot;. We openly talk about<br/>\n&gt; it; she tells me that so-and-so snuck out of her house last night and<br/>\n&gt; met this guy, etc.  Doing that, though, is not *necessary* or even<br/>\n&gt; attractive as an option for her be*cause* we, her parents, don&#39;t set<br/>\n&gt; limits that prohibit her seeing a guy.<br/>\n&gt; True experience: dd met this guy and started dating him (not<br/>\n&gt; car-dating.. neither has their license). I knew that this guy was<br/>\n&gt; coming from a less-than desirable lifestyle(imo) which included<br/>\n&gt; neglectful parents, hanging out at the mall *all* the time, smoking,<br/>\n&gt; smoking pot and being sexually active.  I knew if I prevented her<br/>\n&gt; from seeing him, I&#39;d forever have to be monitoring who she was with<br/>\n&gt; at the movies, who she was meeting at the mall. So, instead, I<br/>\n&gt; welcomed him into our household (fed him, too... remember i mentioned<br/>\n&gt; that before?&lt;g&gt;) I *told* dd what concerned me about him but I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; let those concerns dictate what she could do.  It only took a few<br/>\n&gt; weeks for dd to see that my concerns were warranted and she didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to have any part of his &#39;problems&#39; and she broke off the<br/>\n&gt; relationship. (yeah!!!!)  It all worked out this way because of<br/>\n&gt; respect. DD respects herself & knows we respect and trust her to make<br/>\n&gt; good choices.<br/>\n&gt; Do I ever have weak moments or feel myself waivering in my<br/>\n&gt; convictions? yes!!! And usually when that happens, I come to my lists<br/>\n&gt; and talk it out with other unschoolers and friends and I am reminded<br/>\n&gt; of our past successes and I am told to chill. :-)<br/>\n&gt; Sarah<br/>\n&gt; ~xx~ ~xx~ ~xx~<br/>\n&gt; Sarah Carothers<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

You<br/>\nare placing it in the same category as the dangers of drinking and having<br/>\nsex.  There are other people who don&#39;t believe TV is harmful at all and<br/>\nothers who see some harm, but not as dire as the comparison you&#39;ve tried to<br/>\nprovide.  Some see the dangers of show content; some of commercials; some of<br/>\ninactivity; some of the activities that TV is replacing.  So....what I&#39;m<br/>\nsaying is that the issue of TV isn&#39;t as black and white as &quot;TV good&quot; vs. &quot;TV<br/>\nbad&quot;.  Personal values regarding TV will vary.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, there will certainly be people that disagree with you that<br/>\n&quot;drinking&quot; and &quot;having sex&quot; are bad.  Heck--I do both from time to time and<br/>\nseem to handle them just fine.  :-)  I would guess that, since you have<br/>\nchildren, that you&#39;ve done at least one of them at some time.  :-)  So what<br/>\nyou may be asking is about *responsible* drinking and *responsible* sex.<br/>\nWould it follow for you that there is such a thing as *responsible* TV<br/>\nviewing?<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, if you read my version of &quot;no TV limits&quot; you&#39;ll see that I don&#39;t just<br/>\nleave my kids to their own devices w.r.t. TV, but I give them tools to make<br/>\n*responsible* and *conscious* choices.  I think that almost all<br/>\nconscientious parents here are trying to do the same thing--just in<br/>\ndifferent ways.  I expect to be able to do the same w.r.t. drinking, sex,<br/>\nand drugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest is just 15 so I haven&#39;t lived THROUGH the teen years yet, but<br/>\nwe&#39;re well on our way.  I think that issues like drinking and sex are issues<br/>\nthat we can also discuss rationally and that I can help to give my children<br/>\ntools to make *responsible* decisions regarding these issues.  I don&#39;t yet<br/>\nknow how I&#39;ll fare--ask me in about 5-10 years....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m having trouble wording this next part....bear with me if I don&#39;t make it<br/>\nclear the first time.  There is an assumption by people who haven&#39;t had much<br/>\nexperience with children who haven&#39;t been molded by peer influence.  There<br/>\nis an expectation by many that rebellion is &quot;normal&quot; and that teens, given a<br/>\nchoice will choose the WRONG choice automatically.  Or that the wrong choice<br/>\nwill be the easiest or &quot;most fun&quot; choice for them.  I disagree.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids whose parents or teachers have tightly controlled their lives don&#39;t<br/>\nhave experience making hard choices.  There is a basic mistrust of the<br/>\nteen&#39;s ability to make responsible choices.  Kids react to this mistrust in<br/>\na logical way.....if you&#39;re going to mistrust them and punish them before<br/>\nthey make poor choices then they have nothing to lose by making poor<br/>\nchoices.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said in your post, &quot;a bunch of my friends started staying out late,<br/>\nexperimenting w/drugs, sex etc. I was not allowed to do these things and<br/>\nwould have gotten in big trouble if I&#39;d tried them and gotten caught&quot;.  Do<br/>\nyou really think your friends were &quot;allowed&quot; to experiment with drugs, sex,<br/>\netc?  Or you do you think that their parents would not have approved, but<br/>\nthey did them anyway?  Do you think that their parents just didn&#39;t have the<br/>\ncontrol that they thought they did?  It is my guess that if you had *wanted*<br/>\nto do those things, you could have found a way.  I know I wasn&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot;<br/>\nto do those things, either.  But I did do some of them....and chose not to<br/>\ndo others.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t really, at it&#39;s core, a set of choices of things we<br/>\n&quot;allow&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t allow&quot; our children to do.  It is, at the foundation, a<br/>\nRELATIONSHIP we have with our children.  We trust our children to make good<br/>\nchoices and we give them tools to make those choices for themselves.  We<br/>\nacknowledge the things we have control over and the things we delude<br/>\nourselves into THINKING we have control over.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen your teen goes out on a date, unless you accompany him/her, you have NO<br/>\nCONTROL over whether they have sex or not.  You can set all sorts of rules,<br/>\nbut if they want to have sex, they can easily find a way.  Wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>\nbetter to help them make good choices and lay the burden of responsibility<br/>\non them?<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":55326806,"authorName":"rumpleteasermom","from":"&quot;rumpleteasermom&quot; &lt;rumpleteasermom@...&gt;","profile":"rumpleteasermom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 1721","postDate":"1009989760","msgId":30620,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEwdmRhMCtkMzc3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PFBpbmUuR1NPLjQuMTAuMTAyMDEwMjA5MzM0OTAuNDAxNC0xMDAwMDBAbWVyaGFiYS5jYy5jb2x1bWJpYS5lZHU+"},"prevInTopic":30619,"nextInTopic":30621,"prevInTime":30619,"nextInTime":30621,"topicId":30553,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I already have with my oldest two.

I do not have <br/>\nto tell her not to; it&#39;s all in her value system and what she has <br/>\nlearned from us, her parents. She&#39;s been informed of what happens <br/>\nwhen you do either of those things and SHE&#39;s made the decision not to <br/>\ngo that route. Think about it... who, in their right mind would <br/>\n*choose* to do either of these things if they are given the facts of <br/>\nthe consequences?!  OTOH, some of her friends who *do* have parents <br/>\nrestricting their kids&#39; activities (you have to be in by 10, you will <br/>\nbe severely grounded if we catch you doing &#39;x&#39;, etc) ARE doing all <br/>\nthese things and more!... sneaking at every chance the get. <br/>\nimo It all comes back to the issue of respecting your child... <br/>\nrespecting them to have the sense to *make* the right decisions. That <br/>\nbegins when they are little, not later in life.  I doubt my kid will <br/>\nexperiment with drugs when she goes to college.. a time when, as you <br/>\nput it she&#39;ll be &quot;better able to handle it&quot;. I think she&#39;s learned <br/>\nlong before college age that drugs and irresponsible sex are <br/>\ndangerous endeavors to pursue.  <br/>\nWhen I talk to her and we&#39;re discussing what some of her friends are <br/>\ndoing, she refers to their behavior as &quot;dumb&quot;. We openly talk about <br/>\nit; she tells me that so-and-so snuck out of her house last night and <br/>\nmet this guy, etc.  Doing that, though, is not *necessary* or even <br/>\nattractive as an option for her be*cause* we, her parents, don&#39;t set <br/>\nlimits that prohibit her seeing a guy. <br/>\nTrue experience: dd met this guy and started dating him (not <br/>\ncar-dating.. neither has their license). I knew that this guy was <br/>\ncoming from a less-than desirable lifestyle(imo) which included <br/>\nneglectful parents, hanging out at the mall *all* the time, smoking, <br/>\nsmoking pot and being sexually active.  I knew if I prevented her <br/>\nfrom seeing him, I&#39;d forever have to be monitoring who she was with <br/>\nat the movies, who she was meeting at the mall. So, instead, I <br/>\nwelcomed him into our household (fed him, too... remember i mentioned <br/>\nthat before?&lt;g&gt;) I *told* dd what concerned me about him but I didn&#39;t <br/>\nlet those concerns dictate what she could do.  It only took a few <br/>\nweeks for dd to see that my concerns were warranted and she didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to have any part of his &#39;problems&#39; and she broke off the <br/>\nrelationship. (yeah!!!!)  It all worked out this way because of <br/>\nrespect. DD respects herself & knows we respect and trust her to make <br/>\ngood choices.<br/>\nDo I ever have weak moments or feel myself waivering in my <br/>\nconvictions? yes!!! And usually when that happens, I come to my lists <br/>\nand talk it out with other unschoolers and friends and I am reminded <br/>\nof our past successes and I am told to chill. :-)<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n~xx~ ~xx~ ~xx~<br/>\nSarah Carothers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":421095,"authorName":"Lorraine Goods","from":"Lorraine Goods &lt;lg96@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1721","postDate":"1009982754","msgId":30613,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBpbmUuR1NPLjQuMTAuMTAyMDEwMjA5MzM0OTAuNDAxNC0xMDAwMDBAbWVyaGFiYS5jYy5jb2x1bWJpYS5lZHU+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMGQwMWMxOTMwOSQ3YWNjOTBhMCRlYTg5ODUwYUBwYXZpbGlvbj4="},"prevInTopic":30553,"nextInTopic":30618,"prevInTime":30612,"nextInTime":30614,"topicId":30553,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

In relation to<br/>\nunschooling, however,  I believe the challenge is in allowing your children<br/>\nto explore and understand limits *intrinsically*.  What I find most<br/>\nchallenging about unschooling is that it is up to me to provide<br/>\nalternatives.  I find this difficult because my oldest would love for me to<br/>\nplay more games with her....younger sibs don&#39;t understand how to play at her<br/>\nlevel.  BUT,  because of the younger sibs,  my ability to do this is very<br/>\nlimited.  The three yr old *wants* to play,  the toddler *wants* to throw<br/>\npieces everywhere.<br/>\nThe 6 yr old  doesn&#39;t like games and rules...she like to play making up her<br/>\nown rules as she sees fit.  Outings can be difficult with my children&#39;s age<br/>\nrange, too.  The oldest 2 aren&#39;t able to play in many &quot;kiddielands&quot;...and<br/>\nthe youngest 2 can&#39;t sit through theater productions,  are a major<br/>\ndistraction in museums, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point boils down to...the extrinsic &#39;rules&#39; often circumvent a person&#39;s<br/>\nability to listen to and trust their own gut feelings.<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; As far as TV goes, we allow my son to watch once a week. Those are the<br/>\n&gt; rules, so he doesn&#39;t ask for it on the other days bc he is busy doing<br/>\n&gt; other things, seeing friends, reading, playing and what-have-you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think TV is harmful bc it takes away from time kids can be spent doing<br/>\n&gt; other, more productive and imaginative things, like watching clouds float<br/>\n&gt; thru the sky. The images of women and people of color bother me. Its<br/>\n&gt; materialistic emphasis bothers me. Mostly, though, I hate the sound of it,<br/>\n&gt; that ever-present din in the background. I find my own life is richer<br/>\n&gt; w/out it. But that is my own baggage. My brother, on the other hand,<br/>\n&gt; watches tons of TV. He also happens to be a serious and very successful<br/>\n&gt; novelist who lacks nothing in the imagination or hardworking dept. So who<br/>\n&gt; can really say?
