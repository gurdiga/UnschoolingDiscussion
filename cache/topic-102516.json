It seemed to happen a lot in my<br/>\nchildhood that I would be on the point of doing some task, for example<br/>\ngetting up to carry out my plate, when my mother would tell me to do it. It<br/>\nwas infuriating. I felt that I never got the credit for doing the job, or<br/>\neven for being willing to do it. I also felt completely untrusted, and as if<br/>\nshe thought I was stupid. If I ever said, &quot;I was just about to do that&quot;, I<br/>\nwas treated to disbelieving and condescending comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way my husband occasionally does a similar thing now is that he says in<br/>\na somewhat reproachful tone, &quot;I thought you were going to ....... today&quot;, as<br/>\nif I have blown it off when I merely haven&#39;t done it *yet*. He tells me that<br/>\nhe believes that if he didn&#39;t say this kind of thing I would not complete<br/>\nwhatever the household task is - like do the grocery shopping. It drives me<br/>\ncrazy, because there seems no way to get him to stop this commentary except<br/>\nto prove him wrong with utter perfection on my part. I guess it is a hot<br/>\nbutton trigger for me, probably because of my experience with Mum. <br/>\n<br/>\nAmazingly I managed to have clean clothes and food in the house when I was<br/>\nsingle, which I can tell you from our dating days were not by any means<br/>\nassured in *his* apartment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of laundry what works over here (in an apartment complex) is that<br/>\ngenerally I do all the laundry on Wednesdays. OTOH here is something that<br/>\nputs a slightly different spin on the whole housekeeping thing, that I have<br/>\nposted before.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote begins:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Our house is pretty messy, but at one time was much more so than usual<br/>\nfor a while. Jayn was very little at the time, and not being the big creator<br/>\nthat she is now. I was just letting things go some, feeling a little<br/>\noverwhelmed and resentful - alone in the task. I hadn&#39;t learnt to ask for<br/>\nhelp very well yet. Dh was getting snappier and grumpier. And there were<br/>\nsome arguments, where I was baffled at the intensity of his emotions. I mean<br/>\nhe is the person who would step over the doll five times, and then explode<br/>\nabout mess and make it my responsibility, rather than just pick up the doll<br/>\nthe first time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt finally came out, with many tears on both our parts, that he was afraid I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t love him anymore and was planning to leave him, because I wasn&#39;t<br/>\ntaking care of &quot;his home&quot;. He truly saw (sees) the housework I do as a gift<br/>\nof love to him. It had never occurred to me to see it that way, just as I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it occurred to him to have to express that idea, and his<br/>\ngratitude, to me. He just tried to &quot;force&quot; my love back by demanding I clean<br/>\nup. Since from my perspective my love hadn&#39;t gone away I just got hurt and<br/>\nangry. <br/>\n<br/>\nThings have been way better since. He is more relaxed, or at least acceptant<br/>\nof the times when the house gets out of hand. I try harder to stay on top of<br/>\nthings and am much more successful at asking for help, including regular<br/>\npurges of accumulated clutter - my stuff only, sometimes his. Jayn is a<br/>\nhoarder at the moment. He is also more grateful, and I do all I can to<br/>\nexpress love and reassurance to him in other ways. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I believe that change is necessary.<br/>\n  So what do I do? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n  Elissa<br/>\n  ************************<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Elissa, <br/>\n  This is a constant battle for me, too, but I&#39;m finally winning.  I have been rebelling against people telling me what to do ever since I can remember and now at 36, I&#39;m getting a hold on it.  It&#39;s not about socks, it&#39;s not about the cat box, it&#39;s about being told what to do, or *hearing* that we&#39;re being told what to do even when we&#39;re not.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, I do a whole lot of self-talk, affirmations, even chanting--I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s working exactly, but my house is cleaner and I&#39;m not so uptight about it.  Another thing, if my house is clean there&#39;s no way anyone can tell me it&#39;s not.  I might not also turn innocent comments into something they&#39;re not.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  My childhood was very controlled, and punished, etc.  So, though I may choose to clean, like my mother would have wanted and ordered me to, I can likewise make choices that she&#39;d hate, like hanging maps on the walls of the living room, letting my child stay up to 1:30 am, or whenever she wants to go to bed, letting my desk be as messy as it can be for as long as I can stand it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think we change being rebellious or resentful now by choosing what&#39;s best for us because it IS best, not because someone told us to or expects us to.  When it comes right down to it, everything we do is a choice.  I enjoy making choices that benefit my family and myself.  It&#39;s a much less complicated way to live.<br/>\n<br/>\n  HTH,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Nichole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8151304,"authorName":"rubyprincesstsg@aol.com","from":"rubyprincesstsg@...","profile":"rubyprincesstsg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Doing it","postDate":"1105634220","msgId":102558,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkNy4zNDM3YTgwYi4yZjE3ZmRhY0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":102554,"nextInTopic":102560,"prevInTime":102557,"nextInTime":102559,"topicId":102516,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/12/2005 7:41:23 P.M.

I was convinced he should have enough socks, just couldn&#39;t figure out where they&#39;d all gone.  Finally, I bought another 4-pack last week - now there are 8 or 9 pairs in his drawer.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnother helpful thing for me is to do laundry all thru the week, rather than just on one day.  I do a couple of loads every other day or so, and it seems less daunting.  Catboxes get changed the evening before trash day, so it all goes out the next morning.  Having two boxes seems to help, too.<br/>\n <br/>\nI spent some years specifically NOT doing all the things my Mom had required of me, and NOT doing anything the way she had done it.  The negative method didn&#39;t give me great guidelines, but at least I avoided things like spanking and forcing my kids to be house-slaves.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen my Mom was with us (from Halloween to New Year&#39;s -- she&#39;s out now!) she several times mentioned how hard I work, how much I do around the house, and how I should have the kids do more.  I ignored her the first few times.  Some time during her last week here, I&#39;d had enough.  When she said, &#39;you did housework as a kid, now it&#39;s your turn to...&quot;  I interrupted her and said that just because I had done housework as a kid, didn&#39;t give me the right now to demand the same of my kids.  I told her I ask of my kids what I&#39;m comfortable with.  I know it&#39;s not what she&#39;d be comfortable asking of kids, but now it&#39;s my turn to the be Mom, and this is what I&#39;m comfortable with.<br/>\n <br/>\nI realized that&#39;s really what it&#39;s all about.  I clean house -- to the extent that I do -- because it&#39;s what I want.  I like order in the living room, but the playroom can be chaotic.  I really like to find an empty sink in the morning so I do the dishes every night.  I like clean towels, but whether the bathroom floor gets mopped is really a non-issue to me.  If the mirror is too streaked to see my reflection (and if I really want to see what I look like&lt;g&gt;) I&#39;ll clean it when it bothers me.  I do the things that matter to me as an adult, and I&#39;m confident that when my kids grow up, they&#39;ll do the things that matter to them.  They won&#39;t need me to tell them what should be done, or who they should have do it for them.<br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!

I said I thought he had to &quot;go&quot;  really bad, <br/>\nand so I filled up the cat box we used to have and he couldn&#39;t wait  to get in <br/>\nit.  <br/>\n~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nWash the damned socks without attaching angst or history or politics  or  <br/>\npower struggles to it.<br/>\n~~~<br/>\nOr, make it easy for hubby to do it.  In our house, whomever wants the  house <br/>\nthe cleanest does most of the work.  It varies from week to week, day  to <br/>\nday.  I probably do more just because I&#39;m home more.  But I&#39;d  probably go move <br/>\nthe load out of the washer while he went and gathered up his  socks.  I can&#39;t <br/>\nimagine him ever telling me he&#39;s out of socks, and then  expecting me to wash <br/>\nthem.  He does his own laundry.  On  Sundays.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;ve had our share of power struggles over housework, but after 15  years <br/>\nwe&#39;ve worked them out.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Doing it","postDate":"1105554075","msgId":102530,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMC40MTBhOWFjMy4yZjE2YzQ5YkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":102528,"nextInTopic":102531,"prevInTime":102529,"nextInTime":102531,"topicId":102516,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think  cat boxes are so disgusting that I m not willing to have a cat.
