Life is learning, and we dont find out<br/>\nthe answers until we ask the questions, ofcourse my response directly to her<br/>\nwould have been a bit more constructive, such as explaining to her how we go<br/>\nabout learning math in my unschooling household, not criticizing her choice<br/>\nto ask a question on this list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Perhaps she is quite happy with how she is doing this.

Not exactly what was done tho<br/>\nwas it?

There is some fantastic information, for the most part. I am saddened however to see the degradation of topics, when a person comes up with a question about how to get a &#39;lesson&#39; across, I would be the first person to give examples of how we learn in our home without the need for lessons or workbooks, and also plenty of examples where my children choose to use them, ask for them when we are in a bookstore, and guess what folks .. I don&#39;t say to them &quot;ohhh heaven forbid NOOOOOOO we are unschoolers, its a horrible thing to learn from a workbook or lesson book....bite your tongue child&quot;  I happily purchase the book for them and let them mess around with it if they wish.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one has a clue if this was the situation or not, just alot of assumptions, and the usual high horse comments and criticisms.

Life is learning, and we dont find out the answers until we ask the questions, ofcourse my response directly to her would have been a bit more constructive, such as explaining to her how we go about learning math in my unschooling household, not criticizing her choice to ask a question on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Perhaps she is quite happy with how she is doing this.

Not exactly what was done tho was it? I believe her statement was meant to say just that, if my question doesnt apply to how YOU choose to unschool then no response is necessary. Ofcourse there will always have to be these lil comments wont there?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And I don&#39;t think &quot;Look out<br/>\n&gt;here we go again..&quot;  would be a useful &gt;comment when they do.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No its more useful to pick apart why they chose to call it a lesson, when in fact it was an actual lesson book she was learning from.

If you don&#39;t do lessons, then it does not apply<br/>\nto you.  Some of us do help them do lessons, some children enjoy the<br/>\nworkbooks and things of that sort.  Chaelene just finished one on telling<br/>\ntime and enjoyed every page.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t expect that everybody here is doing the exact same things with their<br/>\nunschooling or anything else.  So if you can&#39;t relate to what I am saying or<br/>\nasking,,,I can surely relate to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSharon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, April 20, 2002 7:04 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] math experience<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 4/19/02 9:23:50 PM Central Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;  How do you help someone else learn something that you are not very good<br/>\nat?<br/>\n&gt;  Do you trade with somebody?   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Trade what?
