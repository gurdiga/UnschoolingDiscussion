How do you get comfortable with letting them do<br/>\n&gt;whatever they want, whenever they want.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;i struggled w/ this. my son is only 4 so i don&#39;t have long-term<br/>\n&gt;experience but what i ran into is,  for example he would ask for<br/>\n&gt;something like he wanted to learn math so we looked into all kinds<br/>\n&gt;ways of learning math and he picked out miqoun/cuisenaire rods.  so we<br/>\n&gt;got a set - books & rods - and he would not sit down and do it.<br/>\n&gt;though he continued to ask to be taught math.  i got frustrated<br/>\n&gt;because i had bought this material and thought &#39;we should use it&#39; but<br/>\n&gt;when i thought about it for a bit i realized it has nothing to do with<br/>\n&gt;the money or if and when he uses the material.  it has to do w/<br/>\n&gt;enjoying what you have and playing with it.  i believe he will use any<br/>\n&gt;and all material he asks for, be it today or years from now.  so i<br/>\n&gt;would say yes let them do whatever they want and try to join in if<br/>\n&gt;they let you and you want to, or just do your thing near by.  but most<br/>\n&gt;importantly listen to them, trust them and have fun w/ them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Zak at the moment spends hours on the same thing and I worry that<br/>\n&gt;he&#39;ll never give up building or playing on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; computer or doing whatever it is he&#39;s doing.  Is this something that<br/>\n&gt;comes over time.  When some of your first<br/>\n&gt; &gt; started was this something you had to deal with in yourselves or<br/>\n&gt;were you ok with whatever happened.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;rene&#39; seem to go through phases where he does the same thing over and<br/>\n&gt;over like he&#39;ll play on the computer for long periods then he won&#39;t go<br/>\n&gt;near it for long periods, or it could be legos or chemistry<br/>\n&gt;experiments or whatever catches his fancy.  but everything he does he<br/>\n&gt;enjoys and what he builds for example becomes more and more intricate<br/>\n&gt;and fascinating.  i would recommending reading some of the material<br/>\n&gt;they have available online at sudbury valley school (if you need the<br/>\n&gt;addy i can get it for you).  it really helped me relax and stop<br/>\n&gt;focusing on &#39;results&#39; and trust in the nature craving for learning<br/>\n&gt;that children have.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What if the something includes you doing things over and over again?<br/>\n&gt;  How involved are you in what they are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;if you like it - very involved; if you have no desire to be doing it-<br/>\n&gt;as little as you can get away with :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; All day, when they ask?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;no:) i&#39;m a firm believer in honesty and independence&lt;g&gt;.  if they need<br/>\n&gt;help - yes, but if they can manage it on their own- no.  i have this<br/>\n&gt;problem w/ reading books - i just can&#39;t take reading the same book<br/>\n&gt;over and over again.  luckily my dh doesn&#39;t mind so rene&#39; gets books<br/>\n&gt;read over and over by him.  but since i like to read to him in the<br/>\n&gt;morning i tried to get him to choose chapter books to read but he<br/>\n&gt;refused. so what i did , just a few weeks ago, was pick a book -<br/>\n&gt;&quot;carry on mr bowditch&quot;  (a book he had choosen to buy but would not<br/>\n&gt;let me read him) - and i told him i was reading this myself and that i<br/>\n&gt;would be happy to read it out loud if he wanted me too and he said<br/>\n&gt;sure.  now he not only happily listens but actually asks me to read<br/>\n&gt;another chapter.  so this way we&#39;re both happy!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Feedback would be great.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dawn F<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;take care,<br/>\n&gt;susan,<br/>\n&gt;austin,tx<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;You have to check this out and pass it along!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6016/14/_/448294/_/962412402/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6016/14/_/448294/_/962412402/</a><br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt;Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Addresses:<br/>\n&gt;Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Holly Atchison","from":"&quot;Holly Atchison&quot; &lt;HollyAtch@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"0Y1w3YXMsWvMm21v1CueS-O4UV7MCrmPG2lp3X1FlSnMh517kM8MKwm6BshnxrG2EUbnS7qi1fDFXWSHdb00DtJUx49_Des1WhH8rVGmuA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling - Letting them do anything they want","postDate":"962417606","msgId":10384,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNzAxMDIxMzI2LjY4NjExLnFtYWlsQGhvdG1haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10382,"nextInTopic":10385,"prevInTime":10383,"nextInTime":10385,"topicId":10158,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have the same trouble with the two girls.

It sounds to me like you have a kid with a good attention span who <br/>\nis going to stay with a subject until he gets all he needs from it. My 9 <br/>\nyear old will get intensely interested in a topic, perhaps spending weeks <br/>\nreading about space, or doing math squares, or drawing or just playing <br/>\nPokemon. When he gets his fill, he moves on. Sometimes he comes back to it <br/>\nlater, sometimes not. It has been great watching the way he learns so <br/>\nnaturally and is so self directed. It is not this way for all kids, so trust <br/>\nhim and be grateful. As for repetition, remember when you had to read the <br/>\nsame story over and over, or play peek-a-boo for ever? The best answer I <br/>\nhave found for this one is to have more kids-the older ones can take turns <br/>\nwith the repetitive things and none of us get as tired of it!!<br/>\n<br/>\nCathie-who just last nite had to decide if we should make the 3 year old get <br/>\noff the computer at 10 p.m. or go to bed and leave her there!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NumoAstro@...\">NumoAstro@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi All:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Questions I have... How do you get comfortable with letting them do<br/>\n&gt;whatever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they want, whenever they want.  Zak at the moment spends hours on the <br/>\n&gt;same<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thing and I worry that he&#39;ll never give up building or playing on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; computer or doing whatever it is he&#39;s doing.  Is this something that <br/>\n&gt;comes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; over time.  When some of your first started was this something you had <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; deal with in yourselves or were you ok with whatever happened.  What if<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something includes you doing things over and over again?  How involved <br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you in what they are doing?

I made it my job to look for all the dinosaur resources that were <br/>\navailable to us.  My computer is hooked up with my library, so I spent quite <br/>\na while reserving every dino book, video or audio tape I could find.  When <br/>\nall this bounty came in, I left it up to my son what to do with them.  Some <br/>\nof the books I really liked were ignored completely by him.  I looked at them <br/>\nmyself and then took them back.  Some of the resources I didn&#39;t think were as <br/>\ngood were the ones Colton poured over for hours.  I just littered his path <br/>\nwith opportunities, and let him take it from there.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I had a successful idea of a way to learn about dinosaurs while catering <br/>\nto one of Colton&#39;s big passions these days, trading cards.  I found a dino <br/>\ntrading card game that came with a large stack of informative cards.  We <br/>\nplayed the game as per the instructions, but Colton played with it in other <br/>\nways as well.  He would sort the cards into carnivores and herbivores, or <br/>\nsort them by time period.  In a short amount of time, while having an <br/>\nabsolute ball, Colton learned a wealth of information about the topic, <br/>\nbecause he wanted to, and for his own reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I also took him to our local Science Center for Dino Days and to see an <br/>\nIMAX 3-D movie about T-Rex.  In addition, we purchased a set of five computer <br/>\nprograms about dinos.  I offered these activities and things before I <br/>\ninvested in them; if Colton hadn&#39;t been interested, that would have been OK.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Lately, Colton has gotten back into Harry Potter again, and we&#39;ve reread <br/>\nthe books together.  He is now making his own set of Harry Potter trading <br/>\ncards.  I am sure more activities will follow, and I am happy to go along for <br/>\nthe ride.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NumoAstro@aol.com","from":"NumoAstro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"cb5YuQF5UN5kiiqmyixUmXgJLn5HBm0GcznOXffxNUYpBjeGdfu4UzRgG7S-w7z07YxI7AzxXks","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling - Letting them do anything they want","postDate":"962234189","msgId":10165,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMwLjVhYmFhNGYuMjY4YmUxNGRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":10158,"nextInTopic":10168,"prevInTime":10164,"nextInTime":10166,"topicId":10158,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/28/2000 4:03:24 PM US Mountain Standard Time, kworthen@mediaone.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1121688924\">In a message dated 6/28/2000 4:03:24 PM US Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kworthen@...\">kworthen@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; unschooling does not mean letting kids do whatever they want. it means<br/>\n following their lead. eventually it all falls into place. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you give me an example please?
