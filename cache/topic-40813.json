I<br/>\ncan get lax about it and need reminders.<br/>\n<br/>\nA request: a couple posts sent recently included the entire digest in the<br/>\nreply.  It&#39;s kind of a pain to scan past that on the digests.  I personally<br/>\nappreciate when writers eliminate as much as possible from the end of their<br/>\nmessage.
