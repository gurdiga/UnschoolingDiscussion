Has been for many many years, enjoy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDusting<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A house becomes a home when you can write &quot;I love you&quot; on the<br/>\nfurniture.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell you how many countless hours that I have spent CLEANING! I<br/>\nused to spend at least 8 hours every weekend making sure things were<br/>\njust<br/>\nperfect -&quot;in case someone came over&quot;. Then I realized one day that no<br/>\none<br/>\ncame over; they were all out living life and having fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, when people visit, I find no need to explain the &quot;condition&quot; of my<br/>\nhome. They are more interested in hearing about the things I&#39;ve been<br/>\ndoing while I was away living life and having fun. If you haven&#39;t<br/>\nfigured<br/>\nthis out yet, please heed t! his advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is short. Enjoy it! Dust if you must, but wouldn&#39;t it be better to<br/>\npaint a picture or write a letter, bake a cake or plant a seed, ponder<br/>\nthe difference between want and need?<br/>\n<br/>\nDust if you must, but there&#39;s not much time, with rivers to swim and<br/>\nmountains to climb, music to hear and books to read, friends to cherish<br/>\nand life to lead.<br/>\n<br/>\nDust if you must, but the world&#39;s out there with the sun in your eyes,<br/>\nthe wind in your hair, a flutter of snow, a shower of rain. This day<br/>\nwill<br/>\nnot come around again.<br/>\n<br/>\nDust if you must, but bear in mind, old age will come and it&#39;s not kind.<br/>\nAnd when you go - and go you must - you, yourself will make more dust!<br/>\n<br/>\nShare this with all the wonderful women in your life! I JUST DID.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not what you gather, but what you scatter ! that tells what kind of<br/>\nlife you have lived.<br/>\nMay your path be lighted by your smile. :-}<br/>\nTheresa White Swan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59640,"nextTopicId":59644}}
