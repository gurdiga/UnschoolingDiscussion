If your kids are happy about getting another pet, then they&#39;re ready. Delayed grief can happen whether you get another pet or not. And it&#39;s not going to mess up any grieving process!:)<br/>\nA book that is truly wonderful for kids in any kind of grieving process is called &quot;It must hurt a lot&quot; about a boy that loses his dog and what he learns through the process of hurting.<br/>\nIt touches on some of the typical things people say or do to try and be helpful, but isn&#39;t actually helpful for someone that is grieving.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t find my copy and tell you who the author is, maybe look it up at half.com?<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84423,"nextTopicId":48141}}
