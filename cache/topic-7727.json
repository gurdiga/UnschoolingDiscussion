I find myself struggling at <br/>\ntimes.  It&#39;s like sometimes I feel it&#39;s a parenting decision, then other <br/>\ntimes I think that maybe I should be more trusting of my child.  For example, <br/>\nmy 5yo made instant oatmeal this morning.  He got out the bowl, spoon, and <br/>\npkg of cereal.  Poured milk in it, stirred , and cooked it in the microwave.  <br/>\nI was still in bed!  He has never done this before, and has never asked if he <br/>\ncould use the microwave by himself.  He just did it.  He came down to tell me <br/>\nabout it, and was SO EXCITED about having done this.  While I was feeling <br/>\nproud of him for the accomplishment, I also felt a little taken aback by his <br/>\n&quot;not asking&quot; first.  So, I shared in his happiness, and we hugged, but then I <br/>\ntold him that from now on he needs to tell me first when he wants to use the <br/>\nmicrowave, as there are some things that do not go in it, etc.  I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto &quot;bust his bubble&quot;, but the parent in me needed to tell him about using it <br/>\nsafely.  So, I felt like I handled it right, but there are times that I will <br/>\nlook back and think that I could have and should have handled something <br/>\ndifferently.  So, yes, as I drone on and on, trusting is a difficult hurdle <br/>\nto jump- at least for me! :)                                                <br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7712,"nextTopicId":7793}}
