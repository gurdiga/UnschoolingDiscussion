It&#39;s his style.  He&#39;s a poet/philosopher, imo (although he is famous as a <br/>\nnovelist, essayist, and memoirist), and utilizes lots of sentence fragments <br/>\nand the like for dramatic effect.  He&#39;s not easy to read, so you&#39;re not alone!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor understanding, this quote could easily be translated to say something <br/>\nlike, *Listen to your life.  See it for the fathomless mystery that it is.  <br/>\nExperience the boredom and pain of your life no less than the excitement and <br/>\ngladness of it.  Touch, taste, and smell your way to the holy and hidden heart of <br/>\nit, because in the last analysis, ALL moments are key moments, and life itself <br/>\nis grace.*<br/>\n<br/>\nThat may be clearer, but it&#39;s not as poetic or graceful as Buechner&#39;s <br/>\nwriting.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for grins, here is his original wording and phrasing placed in (my <br/>\nadmittedly klunky) poetic form.  When I read his prose I often breathe it out as <br/>\npoetry.
