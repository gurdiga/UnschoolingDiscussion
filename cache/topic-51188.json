In homes <br/>\nwhere children have these total lack of limits, these problems *do* <br/>\nexist. We&#39;ve seen them discussed on this list, I&#39;ve heard them <br/>\ndiscussed in real life, I&#39;ve seen the problems occur in homes I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen in. Many people do equate unschooling with a lifestyle that <br/>\nincludes absolutely no parental limits on what the *parent* will do, <br/>\nwith a style of parenting that allows their children to do whatever <br/>\nthey want to, when they want to, with little respect for the rights <br/>\nof others. That might work very well for you and yours, and in that <br/>\ncase - great! But it doesn&#39;t work equally well for everyone, and it <br/>\nis also not necessary to embrace this free-for-all lifestyle in order <br/>\nto unschool. The two things are not synonymous. Unschooling means to <br/>\nme that my kid can choose when and where their learning will occur, <br/>\nand that I will support it. But it doesn&#39;t mean that when I&#39;m half <br/>\nasleep at midnight I will read them twenty more pages of their Star <br/>\nWars book, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, in fact, that struggling with when and where to set limits <br/>\nis a big factor in unschooling burnout for many, many parents. And so <br/>\nthis discussion keeps coming up, and I respect that you have one <br/>\nanswer to the question of how to set limits (or not, as the case may <br/>\nbe), but that style may not work for everyon. I have a different way <br/>\nof going about unschooling and setting my own personal limits. It <br/>\nusually works well for our family, so I share that as well. That <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean your way is &quot;wrong&quot;, and I&#39;d hope that my way is not <br/>\nconsidered &quot;wrong&quot; as well. There should be many, many different ways <br/>\nthat unschooling works for families, or else it is just another dogma <br/>\nforced from above.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t think anyone has recommended or claimed that.  They&#39;re <br/>\n </span></blockquote>recommending <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; against arbitrary rules and against the idea that parents have <br/>\n </span></blockquote>rights and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; needs, but kids just have wants and limits-pushing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How about that parents have rights, and kids have rights??? I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave a right to go into my kid&#39;s room when he&#39;s asleep and demand <br/>\nthat he read me a book. He doesn&#39;t have the right to do that to me <br/>\neither. We each have our own limits, and hopefully we each respect <br/>\neach other&#39;s limits. When our own limits are not being respected, we <br/>\neach have the right to say &quot;No, I won&#39;t do that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In your head you have an idea that people are on the brink of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>becoming one <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; another&#39;s servants?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, but I would certainly feel like a servant if my entire life was <br/>\ndedicated to doing whatever my children asked of me. And that&#39;s the <br/>\nfrustration that some people feel when they enter into that <br/>\nlifestyle. That&#39;s the frustration that&#39;s being expressed here, and <br/>\nhas been expressed here in various posts over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It never occurs to me that there is any servitude.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I don&#39;t feel that there is between myself and my children either. <br/>\nIn either direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I see myself as my child&#39;s mentor, partner, and guide.  We&#39;re on <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the same <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; team.   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ditto.

I may have more (or less, who <br/>\nknows?) but it works for us as well.

Still, sometimes they have like 10 games lined up.  &quot;When <br/>\nyou&#39;re done with his, then can you play this with me&quot;.  &quot;No, she said <br/>\nshe&#39;d play with me next&quot;.  &quot;But that&#39;s not fair because your game <br/>\ntakes longer than mine&quot;.  Or sometimes they will want to play the <br/>\nsame game with me, but they want me to themselves, and want to each <br/>\nhave a turn playing the SAME game with me, individually.  So I will <br/>\nplay Lego Creator 3 times in a row, once with each child, and then <br/>\nthey will each be ready with a different game.  Or want something to <br/>\neat. Or one will want a game and another will want something to <br/>\neat.

An unschooling parent is a <br/>\nfacilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with curiosity and <br/>\nenthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and <br/>\nhow of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob <br/>\nSquarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to find out more <br/>\nabout how video games and life in general are filled with learning, come join <br/>\nus!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling is <br/>\n*not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed <br/>\nlearning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest in <br/>\nunschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in <br/>\nmind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways <br/>\ndesigned to help each other become unschoolers or become better at <br/>\nunschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a <br/>\n&quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively <br/>\ndebate and questioning beliefs to their foundations.

I have read all your messages and plan to<br/>\nre-read them and hopefully respond to some of them if I can find the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I have my period :o) but I had been planning on posting about this for a little<br/>\nwhile now. Last night was just worse then it had been and I came in and ripped my<br/>\npost out before I had the chance to talk myself out of posting. Then this morning<br/>\nat 5 am I found out why last night was so bad when Jason woke up, told me he<br/>\nfelt sick and proceeded to throw up. Yet another reason for me to trust him...he<br/>\nkept telling me that something was bothering him but he didn&#39;t know what. sigh.<br/>\nSo I am working on about 5 hrs of sleep and need to head to bed early...Jason<br/>\nfell asleep tonight on the couch next to me after I read him some more from The Emerald<br/>\nCity of Oz...after taking a 3 hr nap this afternoon, poor little guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso to clear something up as well. Last night was not a normal night...<br/>\nthis is the first time that Jeff has traveled in probably about a year or so (although<br/>\nhe does go out in the evenings from time to time as do I). And he has been pretty involved <br/>\nin the boys bedtime routines...used to be that I would nurse Kyle and Jeff would <br/>\ntake Jason upstairs, get him changed,  brush teeth and read a bit. Then I would <br/>\nbring up Kyle, get him changed and then Jeff would take Kyle and rock/walk<br/>\nhim to sleep. I would read with Jason and lie with him until he<br/>\nwent to sleep (or he would stay up in the craft room). Then as Kyle got older, he<br/>\nstarted wanting to go upstairs with Daddy and Jason for some wrestle time and then<br/>\nwanting to be nursed to sleep by mommy. Jeff stays upstairs and reads or plays<br/>\nsome more with Jason until Kyle is asleep and then I get some reading and cuddle<br/>\ntime with Jason. The only part really where I am on my own is on how we handle<br/>\nit if Jason is not ready to fall asleep after we finish reading. Jeff would love<br/>\nto make the call on that one and just make him stay in his room. I am the one looking<br/>\nto find other options. What is frustrating to me is that we had something that was<br/>\nworking beautifully that now is not working. Jeff thinks that Jason is having more<br/>\nproblems going to sleep now because of all the candy/sugar/soda he is eating since<br/>\nwe have stopped restricting junk food. I think that may be partially to blame (and<br/>\nhopefully will improve once we get through the binge period) but also that he<br/>\njust is not as active as he was during the summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne good thing is that Jason and I got lots of cuddle time today. I apologized for losing<br/>\nit with him last night and we had a good talk about that. I also told him that it was <br/>\nunfair of me to tell him that he had to come up with a bedtime plan that worked for both<br/>\nof us (I was frustrated because I had tried to come up with a compromise that did not work).<br/>\nI told him once he was feeling better that we would sit down together and look at what<br/>\neach of us needs in the evening and see if we could come up with a plan that works<br/>\nfor both of us. Hopefully between the two of us we can come up with something.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I really gotta get some sleep so I am coherent tomorrow...ironic thing is that Kyle<br/>\nactually did not wake up last night until Jason starting throwing up at 5...one of these<br/>\ndays I will get both boys in synch and have a decent nights sleep! <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again...I have lots of food for thought and ideas to ponder. I am sure that I will<br/>\ncome back later with even more questions. My ILs are coming down tomorrow (this is a good<br/>\nthing - they are absolutely wonderful and really understand Jason) so I don&#39;t know how<br/>\nmuch computer time I will have. Plus our routines always get messed up while they are<br/>\nhere so who knows what bedtime will be like when they leave LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":68770018,"authorName":"Christina in GA","from":"&quot;Christina in GA&quot; &lt;clr71@...&gt;","profile":"gift_lady","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Need help on finding the balance - this got long...","postDate":"1039664053","msgId":51276,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDkwMWMyYTE4ZiQ1N2ZlYjIyMCQ1MzVjZmVhOUBhbGx0ZWwubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEyNi4xY2E3MTcyZS4yYjI5NGEwMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51275,"nextInTopic":51278,"prevInTime":51275,"nextInTime":51277,"topicId":51188,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes, he is in bed on a school night between 9pm & 10pm.

But if the parent sets a limit, like &quot;I won&#39;t read stories <br/>\nafter 10:30&quot; or &quot;You can get your own snacks from the refrigerator <br/>\nafter dinner time, but I won&#39;t be cooking&quot; and they don&#39;t feel like <br/>\nthey have a right to set a limit, or they don&#39;t feel confident in <br/>\nthat limit, the child might push against it for awhile until they <br/>\nrealize that it&#39;s firm. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If a parent relaxes and acknowledges a child&#39;s need, there will be <br/>\n </span></blockquote>nothing to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; push for and nothing to push against.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would agree with that for &quot;needs&quot;. If a child is scared and needs <br/>\nto be comforted, I would definitely fulfill that need. If a child <br/>\nwants me to read another story at midnight when I&#39;m on the verge of <br/>\nfalling asleep, I think that falls more into the &quot;want&quot; than &quot;need&quot; <br/>\ncategory, and I don&#39;t believe in fulfilling every single thing my <br/>\nchild wants, especially when it conflicts with a basic need of mine <br/>\n(like for sleep). My kids are always welcome to be around me, <br/>\nwhatever time of day, but they have to respect my body as well. If my <br/>\nbody is sleeping, they may not jump on it, for instance, and I will <br/>\nnot be reading stories past the time when I go to sleep. They could <br/>\njump on me during wrestling hour, and they&#39;re welcome to curl up <br/>\nagainst me during the sleeping time, but my limit is no jumping when <br/>\nI&#39;m sleeping. I feel pretty comfortable setting my own personal <br/>\nlimits, and the kids usually respect them. I think it also helps them <br/>\nset limits when they are around other people. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If a parent &quot;relaxes,&quot; but still has the hope that the child will <br/>\n </span></blockquote>pretend the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; rule is still there, and somehow come up with his own bedtime and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>routine, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the parent still has an unrealistic picture of what&#39;s natural.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Relaxing&quot; a rule isn&#39;t enough.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Working from principles instead of rules is what will make the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I see a difference in setting a rule and a personal limit. I <br/>\nwould see a rule as &quot;Your bedtime is 8:00, no matter what. You have <br/>\nto stay in your bed after that time.&quot; Whereas a personal limit might <br/>\nbe: &quot;I need to be asleep by 11:00. You&#39;re welcome to stay up, but you <br/>\nwill need to be quiet since other people in the house are sleeping. <br/>\nYou can read or play quietly downstairs, or you can cuddle up in our <br/>\nbed, as long as you don&#39;t disturb the people who are sleeping there. <br/>\nIf you want me to read to you, I will do so before 10:30, when I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to start getting ready for bed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that it is easy to pretend you have no rules, yet still have <br/>\nthem in your head, and expect kids to somehow come up with ways to <br/>\ncomform to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only rules we have in this family are for safety, and those are <br/>\nnever relaxed.

They slept together (both boys) until they were too big to fit <br/>\ninto a single bed together. It wasn&#39;t part of my family tradition for <br/>\nchildren to sleep with parents, and so I didn&#39;t do it, then.  And as a single <br/>\nmother, I really needed some boundary somewhere.  Thankfully, those two were <br/>\ncapable of falling asleep at the drop of a hat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest is a different story, though.  He sleeps with us, but now at 9, <br/>\nit&#39;s only an on-and-off kind of thing.  It depends completely on his stage of <br/>\ndevelopment, what he happens to be processing, etc.  If he&#39;s in a <br/>\nhappy-go-lucky stage, he&#39;ll go to sleep with a kiss and a hug, but if he&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;imagining what it would be like to be kidnapped&quot; (like he was last night) <br/>\nthen someone&#39;s going to have to sleep with him.

It is not controlling your child to <br/>\nsay &quot;I&#39;m going to be available for 15 minutes to help you get to <br/>\nsleep, and then I&#39;m going to go and read my book (or work on crafts, <br/>\nor whatever). There are ways that you can set limits for yourself <br/>\nwithout attempting to place control over others.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are 3 and 6, and they&#39;re both extroverted chatterboxes, so I <br/>\nsympathize with the need to have some downtime. Is there a way that <br/>\nyour husband can pitch in and give you that time, maybe not at a time <br/>\nwhen the kids are already tired? It&#39;s a requirement for me that I get <br/>\ntwo hours to myself a day, and DH usually has the kids at that time. <br/>\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s too much to ask out of 24 hours (as I&#39;m the one <br/>\nwho still nurses my littlest in the middle of the night, and helps <br/>\nwith nighttime potty stuff, I&#39;m &quot;on duty&quot; for 22 hours a day.) <br/>\nUsually, I take &quot;my time&quot; when DH comes home from work, and I use <br/>\nthat time to exercise. Sometimes I take the time in the morning, <br/>\nbefore DH leaves for work, it just depends on the schedule of the <br/>\nday. On weekends or days that DH has off, I usually take a bit more <br/>\ntime for myself. I think this is an important time for DH to be with <br/>\nthe kids exclusively, and for me to recharge my batteries and keep <br/>\nmyself feeling good. When DH can&#39;t be with the kids, I use the <br/>\ndaycare at the gym, or I trade playdate/babysitting time with other <br/>\nHS moms.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow bedtime works here is that we start our bedtime routine at around <br/>\n7:30 or so. We get a snack, get teeth brushed and get into pajamas. <br/>\nThen I read to the kids. This is something they really look forward <br/>\nto, so getting through the teeth brushing and pajamas usually goes <br/>\nquickly.  I read a couple of picture books, and then a chapter of <br/>\nwhatever book we&#39;re on (currently Lord of the Rings), and then we <br/>\nhead to the kids&#39; bedroom. I lay down and nurse my daughter (the <br/>\nyoungest) to sleep, and my son lays on his bed and quietly looks at <br/>\nbooks. Alternatively, if he&#39;s not feeling sleepy, he can go down to <br/>\nthe living room and play during this time. After that, he and I have <br/>\na little time together where we talk about our day and whatever else <br/>\ncomes up, then if he&#39;s tired I will lay down with him to go to sleep. <br/>\nAfter that, I get up and go about my own business. If he hasn&#39;t <br/>\nfallen asleep or isn&#39;t sleepy, he&#39;s free to play quietly and get <br/>\nhimself to sleep. He usually doesn&#39;t want to do that, so the time I <br/>\nlay down with him is when he goes to sleep. Both of my kids are awake <br/>\nby 7:00 am, so I rarely have time to myself in the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d suggest coming up with some routine that works well for you. A <br/>\ntime in the evening when you start that routine helps get everyone&#39;s <br/>\nbody ready for bed. If you can get your &quot;me time&quot; in at another time <br/>\nof the day, then you won&#39;t feel frantic about making sure the kids go <br/>\nright to sleep and you can enjoy the evening time with them without <br/>\nfeeling cheated. I think many parents tie their &quot;me time&quot; to bedtime, <br/>\nand that makes for a lot of conflict and anxiety. Also, if you have a <br/>\nroutine, then the kids know what to expect, and when to expect it. In <br/>\nour case, they can expect me to read them stories when they&#39;re <br/>\ndressed and ready for bed, and then when I&#39;m done reading stories I <br/>\ndon&#39;t really go back and read more (I get too tired, for one thing, <br/>\nand tend to doze off while I&#39;m reading!).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I really need a new perspective here...but I feel like the more <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that I give up control,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the more Jason pushes and pushes. How do I know when to draw the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>line? Is it ok to draw<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a line? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think kids will definitely push until they find a place where you <br/>\nfeel confident. If you don&#39;t feel confident of what you&#39;re doing, <br/>\nhe&#39;s going to keep pushing and pushing. I think it&#39;s definitely okay <br/>\nto draw lines *for yourself* with your own limits, and stick to them. <br/>\nNot controlling children doesn&#39;t mean you have to disrespect <br/>\nyourself. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Any ideas<br/>\n&gt; for tiring an active 6 yo out? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think your idea of finding a Y or rec center is a good one. Our <br/>\nlocal HS group has a reserved time at a gymnastics center once a <br/>\nweek. Also a playdate at a local pizza parlor with a kid-play area, <br/>\nplaydates at friend&#39;s houses, and other opportunities for indoor <br/>\nenergy-spending during the winter. I make a point to take the kids <br/>\nswimming 2 or 3 days a week, and on any day when it&#39;s not raining, we <br/>\nare either out walking or biking. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing my DH does that the kids really love is that he <br/>\nhas &quot;Wrestle time&quot; with them, usually about an hour before we start <br/>\nour bedtime routine. He takes them up to our bed and they jump <br/>\naround, pile on him, he throws them on the bed, they pillow fight, <br/>\netc. This is a great way to get out big energy and get the kids ready <br/>\nto wind down. He usually does this for at least a half and hour, <br/>\nsometimes up to an hour or more. It&#39;s also a great way for him to <br/>\nconnect with them. My dad used to do this with us, and we loved it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Any ideas for helping hubby not take this personally<br/>\n&gt; and realize that in 10 years this period of our lives will seem <br/>\n </span></blockquote>much shorter and less<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; important then it does now? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe you could try brainstorming with him ways in which you can <br/>\nsolve the problem? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unrealistic of a couple to want <br/>\nto spend some time together without the kids around. You&#39;ll need to <br/>\nfind ways to get that time, whether it&#39;s swapping childcare with <br/>\nother couples you trust, or finding a nighttime routine that works <br/>\nfor all of you, or whatever. It&#39;s not realistic for him to expect <br/>\nthat things will work perfectly every single night. Also not <br/>\nrealistic to expect you to bear the whole burden of the nighttime <br/>\nroutine, and finding time to yourself. My DH knows that the more time <br/>\nhe gives me on my own, the more my nighttime hours belong to him ;-), <br/>\nbecause I have my own needs. Maybe your DH can take charge of <br/>\nteethbrushing, story-reading, etc. so that you have some evening time <br/>\nto do your own thing, then you can get the kids to bed and afterwards <br/>\nyou&#39;ll have couple time? Or however it will work for you. Everyone <br/>\nhas to pitch in, it can&#39;t all fall on you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Any ideas for eeking out some time to get things done <br/>\n&gt; around the house (and please know that I am not expecting to keep <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the house spotless, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but the clutter gets awful and I start going crazy). <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Develop cleaning routines during the day and just do them. Get the <br/>\nkids to pitch in, or let them play on their own, but just do them. It <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t take real long to keep a house clean if you break it down. I <br/>\nhave a simple cleaning chart that we follow. Every day after <br/>\nbreakfast, I clean up the kitchen while the kids are still eating, <br/>\nthen they go and play or else they help me out while I do whatever <br/>\nthe task is that day. It might be vacuuming one floor, or cleaning <br/>\none bathroom, or whatever. None of the tasks take real long because <br/>\nwe do them every week. The living room gets picked up every night <br/>\nbefore we go to bed, so that&#39;s taken care of as well. The laundry is <br/>\nthe only thing that tends to pile up, but I can usually get the kids <br/>\nplaying &quot;sock fight&quot; while I fold clothes. Or sometimes it just piles <br/>\nup. One thing that helps is to have a place for things, and just make <br/>\nsure they go there. Again, routines. Like we have a shoe rack, and <br/>\nwhen we come in we take off our shoes and they go to the shoe rack. <br/>\nWe have a coat rack where the coats get hung up. I love those <br/>\ntupperware-type bins with lids with handles that the kids can put <br/>\ntheir toys in. They can carry a bin with all the superheros, or <br/>\nhorses, or whatever, and when they&#39;re done it&#39;s easy to pick them all <br/>\nup and put them back in the bin.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with all of this. Remember (as FlyLady says) it&#39;s all about <br/>\nbaby steps. Don&#39;t expect everything to be solved overnight, or <br/>\neverything to ever go perfectly. Do what you can, don&#39;t sweat the <br/>\nrest, try to get everyone else to pitch in so you don&#39;t bear the <br/>\nwhole burden on your back.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

It is not controlling your child to <br/>\nsay &quot;I&#39;m going to be available for 15 minutes to help you get to <br/>\nsleep, and then I&#39;m going to go and read my book (or work on crafts, <br/>\nor whatever). There are ways that you can set limits for yourself <br/>\nwithout attempting to place control over others.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are 3 and 6, and they&#39;re both extroverted chatterboxes, so I <br/>\nsympathize with the need to have some downtime. Is there a way that <br/>\nyour husband can pitch in and give you that time, maybe not at a time <br/>\nwhen the kids are already tired? It&#39;s a requirement for me that I get <br/>\ntwo hours to myself a day, and DH usually has the kids at that time. <br/>\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s too much to ask out of 24 hours (as I&#39;m the one <br/>\nwho still nurses my littlest in the middle of the night, and helps <br/>\nwith nighttime potty stuff, I&#39;m &quot;on duty&quot; for 22 hours a day.) <br/>\nUsually, I take &quot;my time&quot; when DH comes home from work, and I use <br/>\nthat time to exercise. Sometimes I take the time in the morning, <br/>\nbefore DH leaves for work, it just depends on the schedule of the <br/>\nday. On weekends or days that DH has off, I usually take a bit more <br/>\ntime for myself. I think this is an important time for DH to be with <br/>\nthe kids exclusively, and for me to recharge my batteries and keep <br/>\nmyself feeling good. When DH can&#39;t be with the kids, I use the <br/>\ndaycare at the gym, or I trade playdate/babysitting time with other <br/>\nHS moms.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow bedtime works here is that we start our bedtime routine at around <br/>\n7:30 or so. We get a snack, get teeth brushed and get into pajamas. <br/>\nThen I read to the kids. This is something they really look forward <br/>\nto, so getting through the teeth brushing and pajamas usually goes <br/>\nquickly.  I read a couple of picture books, and then a chapter of <br/>\nwhatever book we&#39;re on (currently Lord of the Rings), and then we <br/>\nhead to the kids&#39; bedroom. I lay down and nurse my daughter (the <br/>\nyoungest) to sleep, and my son lays on his bed and quietly looks at <br/>\nbooks. Alternatively, if he&#39;s not feeling sleepy, he can go down to <br/>\nthe living room and play during this time. After that, he and I have <br/>\na little time together where we talk about our day and whatever else <br/>\ncomes up, then if he&#39;s tired I will lay down with him to go to sleep. <br/>\nAfter that, I get up and go about my own business. If he hasn&#39;t <br/>\nfallen asleep or isn&#39;t sleepy, he&#39;s free to play quietly and get <br/>\nhimself to sleep. He usually doesn&#39;t want to do that, so the time I <br/>\nlay down with him is when he goes to sleep. Both of my kids are awake <br/>\nby 7:00 am, so I rarely have time to myself in the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d suggest coming up with some routine that works well for you. A <br/>\ntime in the evening when you start that routine helps get everyone&#39;s <br/>\nbody ready for bed. If you can get your &quot;me time&quot; in at another time <br/>\nof the day, then you won&#39;t feel frantic about making sure the kids go <br/>\nright to sleep and you can enjoy the evening time with them without <br/>\nfeeling cheated. I think many parents tie their &quot;me time&quot; to bedtime, <br/>\nand that makes for a lot of conflict and anxiety. Also, if you have a <br/>\nroutine, then the kids know what to expect, and when to expect it. In <br/>\nour case, they can expect me to read them stories when they&#39;re <br/>\ndressed and ready for bed, and then when I&#39;m done reading stories I <br/>\ndon&#39;t really go back and read more (I get too tired, for one thing, <br/>\nand tend to doze off while I&#39;m reading!).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I really need a new perspective here...but I feel like the more <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that I give up control,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the more Jason pushes and pushes.

Is it ok to draw<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a line? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think kids will definitely push until they find a place where you <br/>\nfeel confident. If you don&#39;t feel confident of what you&#39;re doing, <br/>\nhe&#39;s going to keep pushing and pushing. I think it&#39;s definitely okay <br/>\nto draw lines *for yourself* with your own limits, and stick to them. <br/>\nNot controlling children doesn&#39;t mean you have to disrespect <br/>\nyourself. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Any ideas<br/>\n&gt; for tiring an active 6 yo out? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think your idea of finding a Y or rec center is a good one. Our <br/>\nlocal HS group has a reserved time at a gymnastics center once a <br/>\nweek. Also a playdate at a local pizza parlor with a kid-play area, <br/>\nplaydates at friend&#39;s houses, and other opportunities for indoor <br/>\nenergy-spending during the winter. I make a point to take the kids <br/>\nswimming 2 or 3 days a week, and on any day when it&#39;s not raining, we <br/>\nare either out walking or biking. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing my DH does that the kids really love is that he <br/>\nhas &quot;Wrestle time&quot; with them, usually about an hour before we start <br/>\nour bedtime routine. He takes them up to our bed and they jump <br/>\naround, pile on him, he throws them on the bed, they pillow fight, <br/>\netc. This is a great way to get out big energy and get the kids ready <br/>\nto wind down. He usually does this for at least a half and hour, <br/>\nsometimes up to an hour or more. It&#39;s also a great way for him to <br/>\nconnect with them. My dad used to do this with us, and we loved it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Any ideas for helping hubby not take this personally<br/>\n&gt; and realize that in 10 years this period of our lives will seem <br/>\n </span></blockquote>much shorter and less<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; important then it does now? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe you could try brainstorming with him ways in which you can <br/>\nsolve the problem? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unrealistic of a couple to want <br/>\nto spend some time together without the kids around. You&#39;ll need to <br/>\nfind ways to get that time, whether it&#39;s swapping childcare with <br/>\nother couples you trust, or finding a nighttime routine that works <br/>\nfor all of you, or whatever. It&#39;s not realistic for him to expect <br/>\nthat things will work perfectly every single night. Also not <br/>\nrealistic to expect you to bear the whole burden of the nighttime <br/>\nroutine, and finding time to yourself. My DH knows that the more time <br/>\nhe gives me on my own, the more my nighttime hours belong to him ;-), <br/>\nbecause I have my own needs. Maybe your DH can take charge of <br/>\nteethbrushing, story-reading, etc. so that you have some evening time <br/>\nto do your own thing, then you can get the kids to bed and afterwards <br/>\nyou&#39;ll have couple time? Or however it will work for you. Everyone <br/>\nhas to pitch in, it can&#39;t all fall on you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Any ideas for eeking out some time to get things done <br/>\n&gt; around the house (and please know that I am not expecting to keep <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the house spotless, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but the clutter gets awful and I start going crazy). <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Develop cleaning routines during the day and just do them. Get the <br/>\nkids to pitch in, or let them play on their own, but just do them. It <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t take real long to keep a house clean if you break it down. I <br/>\nhave a simple cleaning chart that we follow. Every day after <br/>\nbreakfast, I clean up the kitchen while the kids are still eating, <br/>\nthen they go and play or else they help me out while I do whatever <br/>\nthe task is that day. It might be vacuuming one floor, or cleaning <br/>\none bathroom, or whatever. None of the tasks take real long because <br/>\nwe do them every week. The living room gets picked up every night <br/>\nbefore we go to bed, so that&#39;s taken care of as well. The laundry is <br/>\nthe only thing that tends to pile up, but I can usually get the kids <br/>\nplaying &quot;sock fight&quot; while I fold clothes. Or sometimes it just piles <br/>\nup. One thing that helps is to have a place for things, and just make <br/>\nsure they go there. Again, routines. Like we have a shoe rack, and <br/>\nwhen we come in we take off our shoes and they go to the shoe rack. <br/>\nWe have a coat rack where the coats get hung up. I love those <br/>\ntupperware-type bins with lids with handles that the kids can put <br/>\ntheir toys in. They can carry a bin with all the superheros, or <br/>\nhorses, or whatever, and when they&#39;re done it&#39;s easy to pick them all <br/>\nup and put them back in the bin.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with all of this. Remember (as FlyLady says) it&#39;s all about <br/>\nbaby steps. Don&#39;t expect everything to be solved overnight, or <br/>\neverything to ever go perfectly. Do what you can, don&#39;t sweat the <br/>\nrest, try to get everyone else to pitch in so you don&#39;t bear the <br/>\nwhole burden on your back.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85 &lt;sheran@ptd.net&gt;","from":"&quot;kayb85 &lt;sheran@...&gt;&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Need help on finding the balance - this got long...","postDate":"1039632156","msgId":51219,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGF0ODB1cytraXJkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0MS40ZDZmNzQ3LjJiMjhkMTRkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":51218,"nextInTopic":51221,"prevInTime":51218,"nextInTime":51220,"topicId":51188,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... limits set ... parenting ...

I get grumpy around ten<br/>\nat night and don&#39;t want to be a short order cook if my son wants &quot;second<br/>\ndinner&quot;, dessert or &quot;first breakfast&quot;.  (TM the LOTR movie)  I&#39;m<br/>\nreasonably cheerful about fixing what he wants, when he wants it the<br/>\nrest of the day.  (I only have one kid.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also huffy about starting bedtime stories at that hour.  (Sometimes<br/>\nDH will read them, figuring it&#39;s in his best interest to let me rest and<br/>\nrelax a little before he comes to bed.)  I remind my son at 9pm if he<br/>\nwants to watch a 1 hour TV show that I may not be available after the<br/>\nshow for bedtime reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my approach is that I go &quot;off duty&quot; around 10pm.  My son is eight and<br/>\na half now and can go to sleep without a story and without a parental<br/>\nlie-down, although getting back up and continuing to talk to us happens<br/>\nmore if we skip the &quot;routine&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh recently started a new job that requires earlier rising and I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen aiming to turn the TV off at 9pm, so that my son is asleep ay 9:30<br/>\ninstead of 10:30.  However, I&#39;ve had a tough time following my own rule<br/>\nand foregoing the 9pm TV shows, or taping them.  So I&#39;m even sympathetic<br/>\nto your husband.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found, in my small family in a small house, that the TV and<br/>\ncomputer games need to be shut off before anyone is going to go to bed<br/>\nwillingly.  Then, sometimes, they go back on afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my DH was a child, as the youngest, he was sent to bed at 8pm,<br/>\nwhile the rest of the family watched TV at a blaring volume that<br/>\nprevented sleeping.  It isn&#39;t always easy for him to sacrifice his<br/>\nhard-won adult privileges so that we can treat our son more sympathetically.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know &quot;wanting time with dad&quot; is a major reason for schooled kids to<br/>\nstay up late.

I read your post this morning<br/>\nand wanted to offer some encouragement if I could.  My children are now 17, 15, 12 and 7.  I<br/>\nremember how hard it was when they were all little.  I felt like I was never sleeping and every<br/>\nminute awake was taken up.  Looking back now, the time went so quickly.  I know it&#39;s easier to see<br/>\nlooking back rather than looking ahead.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 3 years ago I was working full time (at night) and homeschooling.  I went and went and went<br/>\nuntil I got really sick and had to quit working completely.  As hard as this time has been, it has<br/>\nmade me realize that time is always passing and we have to decide what is most important to us and<br/>\nbe sure we make it happen.  For me, that was spending time with my children now so that when they<br/>\nwere older, I would have the comfort of knowing that I gave them the best that I could.  My<br/>\nhusband and I have had many discussions about it and God has blessed us with understanding for<br/>\neach other (after MANY DISCUSSIONS.)  I&#39;ve been so sick these past few years that I couldn&#39;t even<br/>\ndrive and quess what?  My 17 year old son has to drive me around.  He never complains and I&#39;m sure<br/>\nhe&#39;d rather be doing something else a lot of the time.  I think being in a family is a lot of give<br/>\nand take.  I give but now I&#39;m having to take too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other side of this coin, even though my children are older I still am &quot;busy&quot; with them.  My<br/>\n12 year old son has started wanting me to stay with him until he goes to sleep.  I worried about<br/>\nit at first and then I remembered being that way when I was about 12.  I think our kids go through<br/>\nso many stages and if we can find a way to get through them without worrying (easy to say, not<br/>\neasy to do) then they pass quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou sound like you are a wonderful Mother.  Don&#39;t feel guilty about needing time to yourself.  My<br/>\nescape is cross stitching but many projects were a long time getting done when my children were<br/>\nlittle.  I would stitch for a few minutes and then have to stop for a few hours.  But on the<br/>\npositive side, I look at my children now and we have a wonderful relationship.  My teenages have<br/>\nbeen such a blessing.  Not all of the worries that a lot of people have.  I thank God that I<br/>\nstarted homeschooling them all those years ago and I cherish each and every moment I have had with<br/>\nthem (even 2:00 am feedings).  Blessings to you and please know that you are not alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nRenee in GA<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

He<br/>\nstayed in our room until he was 4 yrs old and then I would still lay down with him <br/>\nto fall asleep. Last year we had progressed to where I could lay with him for a little <br/>\nwhile and then leave. Then he started having problems falling asleep again, so I would <br/>\nlet him stay up in my craft room with me while I did my rubber stamping. He would tell <br/>\nme when he was tired and fall asleep easily. The first couple of weeks he stayed up until <br/>\n10 or 11. After that he would ask to go to sleep around 8:30 and 9. I felt vindicated! I had<br/>\nalways said that he would be able to self-regulate when given the choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow it is a year later and things have changed. Part of it I am sure is because it is<br/>\ncold out and we are not getting out as much. Part of it is that he no longer has to<br/>\nget up at 8 am for preschool. Plus he is not getting as much activity now (in addition<br/>\nto the activity at the preschool, we usually would play with  his best friend (who<br/>\nwe car pooled with) after school for an hour or more). He is staying up until 11 (or<br/>\nlater). If I let him sleep until he wakes up, he sleeps until around 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is this...I am feeling smothered. Jason is a very intense little boy. <br/>\nI love him to death but he is an extrovert in the extreme sense of the word. If he <br/>\nis awake, he wants interaction. He will play by himself (for short periods of time), <br/>\nbut never alone - he never goes into his own room to play alone. The worst feeling <br/>\nin the world for him is to feel lonely. Most of his favorite activities include some <br/>\nother person. He has never been the type to color at the table while I do the dishes...<br/>\nhe always wanted me to color *with* him. It has gotten a bit better now that Kyle is <br/>\ngetting older (will be 3 in Feb), takes some of the pressure off me. I am coming to <br/>\naccept this part of his personality and trying to work with it...we invite friends <br/>\nover often (still trying to make some hsing connections so we can find more friends <br/>\nduring the day). <br/>\n<br/>\nKyle has just given up his naps and is usually asleep by 9. And up by 7:30. Plus<br/>\nsomething is going on and he has started nursing a lot at night (he starts out in <br/>\nJason&#39;s room and then I get him when he wakes up) so I have not been getting too<br/>\nmuch sleep. So now I have been trying to get to bed around midnight...which if Jason<br/>\nis not asleep until 11 or later does not leave much time for me to get anything done.<br/>\nI do get out to rubber stamping clubs about 3 or 4 times a month. Getting up earlier<br/>\ndoes not help because 7:30 is pretty early for me if I have been up a couple of times<br/>\na night and if I get up early, Kyle usually gets up early too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been trying to talk with Jason about how mommy has needs to...that there are a lot<br/>\nof boring things that I try to leave for when he is asleep. How mommy needs down time and likes<br/>\nto have time alone with daddy or by herself. I think that what is getting to me lately is that<br/>\nI see that he is getting tired, but he is really *trying* to stay awake. We have also<br/>\nbeen talking about listening to your body and what it is trying to tell you. But he is fighting<br/>\nit...it is turning into a control thing ( which I usually try to avoid). Since I have been<br/>\nletting up on controlling him (we gave up tv and food controls about 2-3 months ago), control<br/>\nseems to be more of an issue with him, if that makes any sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other problem I have is dh. He does not agree with my approach at all and thinks that I<br/>\nam being a doormat. He has absolutely no problem with expecting Jason to stay up in his<br/>\nroom after a certain time. He wants to have time to watch his tv shows, relax and spend time<br/>\nwith me. So I feel like I am trying to balance both dh&#39;s and Jason&#39;s needs and it is <br/>\nnot happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not dealing with this well and would appreciate all insight. Tonight I decided that since<br/>\ndh is away until Friday, I would try a new approach. We watched a little tv while I nursed<br/>\nKyle to sleep. Jason then wanted to listen to the Wizard of Oz audio tape we got from the<br/>\nlibrary. I told him that I had some cleaning to do, but when he was tired to let me know<br/>\nand I would go up and lay down with him (thinking that I could get some of my needs met<br/>\nto get something done and still meet his needs of not being alone when he goes to sleep). He<br/>\nsaid that he was tired around 10 but wanted to me to read to him. I said that it was<br/>\ntoo late for that (I really was tired, but looking back on it, it would not have killed<br/>\nme to read a chapter...I think that it was my way of still controlling the situation). We<br/>\nwent up and laid down. He ended up getting fidgety, getting up for water etc etc etc. I<br/>\nended up losing it. All I want is for him to go to sleep when he is tired! <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not the way that I want to end the day. But I am really struggling with giving<br/>\nup the control thing....I go back and forth between completely seeing his point of view<br/>\n(it sucks to know that my two favorite people are downstairs while I am stuck up here<br/>\nin this room) and completely feeling smothered and feeling like a couple of hours in<br/>\nthe evening to myself is not too much to ask. Having him stay up late makes me feel<br/>\nvery stressed for time...btween keeping up with the house, spending time with hubby,<br/>\nkeeping up with my e-lists (which often keep me sane) and trying to find time to<br/>\nrelax and read and now needing more sleep since Kyle is up so much, I am really going<br/>\ncrazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really need a new perspective here...but I feel like the more that I give up control,<br/>\nthe more Jason pushes and pushes. How do I know when to draw the line? Is it ok to draw<br/>\na line? I kind of feel like I have to draw a line or else I start getting resentful.<br/>\nIs this resentfulness something that I just need to adjust my attitude on or is<br/>\nit a sign that things need to come back into balance. And how do I get them back into<br/>\nbalance if that is the case. I just feel like my personality would make it very easy<br/>\nto swing too far out of balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking for a local gym, rec center or y around<br/>\nhere that would have a program for the kids so I can take a yoga class and they can play<br/>\nand wear themselves out a bit. I am working on making connections in the hs community<br/>\nso that Jason can go to friend&#39;s houses for playdates (I had a great network made up of <br/>\nhis friends but they are all in school during the day now). I am also working on getting<br/>\nour living room set up with a tv and comfy couches etc thinking that maybe if dh<br/>\ncan watch his shows in the family room and Jason stays in the living room then maybe<br/>\nthat will take some of the pressure off. Any other ideas? Any ideas<br/>\nfor tiring an active 6 yo out? Any ideas for helping hubby not take this personally<br/>\nand realize that in 10 years this period of our lives will seem much shorter and less<br/>\nimportant then it does now? Any ideas for eeking out some time to get things done <br/>\naround the house (and please know that I am not expecting to keep the house spotless, <br/>\nbut the clutter gets awful and I start going crazy). <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I just need to make that shift in my attitude, but I am having a hard time<br/>\ndoing it. I did it when he was little, but it is harder now that he is 6...I honestly<br/>\nthought that the bedtime thing would be solved by now. I just feel like I have screwed<br/>\neverything up somehow and turned it into a control issue without even meaning to. <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the frantic sound to this post...I am just feeling very exhausted. I need<br/>\nto go to bed now...Kyle will probably be up in a few hours....<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

You cannot be all things to all people. One thing that I&#39;ve done for myself is to give myself a bedtime! I am not a morning person and I hate to get up for work, so I&#39;m sure I&#39;m in bed by 10:30 - 11 at the latest. Ds is put to bed between 9 & 10 pm most nights so I do have a little time to myself and some time with dh before he goes to work. He works nights and has to be up by 10:30 to get ready to leave. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t want to make it seem like you are ordering him to go to bed at a certain I definitely agree on some exercise during the day. At some point even just going for a walk around the block for some fresh air may be just what he needs. My ds has an &quot;Elmosize&quot; video tape with some fun exercises on it. Maybe something like that would be good to do with your son so he can have some movement. But you are the parent, he is the child. There have to be some limits set somewhere just so you can get some peace and rest for yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you find some balance and get some sleep!<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina in GA<br/>\nHappiness comes through doors you<br/>\ndidn&#39;t even know you left open.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Stephanie Elms <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, December 11, 2002 12:37 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Need help on finding the balance - this got long...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  OK.

What time of the month is it? lol <br/>\nSeriously, stuff like this stresses me out at certain times of the <br/>\nmonths more than others. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I struggle with this at all times of the months.  The situation <br/>\nin our family is that all 3 kids want me to lay with them before they <br/>\ngo to sleep.  Sometimes I&#39;m not ready for bed but I&#39;m too mentally <br/>\ntired to keep going doing all kinds of stuff for/with them.  They <br/>\nwould keep me going until 3 am doing all kinds of stuff and <br/>\neventually I would lose it.  No human being can keep being torn in 3 <br/>\ndirections being constantly used all day long and half the night.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI considered agreeing on a bedtime with them, but it wouldn&#39;t work <br/>\nsetting the same time every night, since dh likes to watch tv shows <br/>\nor movies with me on some nights depending on his work schedule, but <br/>\non other nights he&#39;s in bed at 9 pm.  And I like the kids being <br/>\nflexible with their sleeping, so that they can go places and stay up <br/>\nlater and not be crabby and falling asleep.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I&#39;ve been doing is each evening I tell the kids the <br/>\napproximate time that we&#39;re going up to bed.  They know they have the <br/>\noption of staying up later than me and getting themselves into bed, <br/>\nbut they don&#39;t want to do that.  I think just knowing that option <br/>\nexists keeps them from complaining about going to bed.  What they <br/>\nwould complain about is me going to bed and not laying with them <br/>\nfirst. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey fight over who I&#39;m going to lay with first sometimes.  I try to <br/>\nrotate fairly.  If one child seems particularly needy one night, I&#39;ll <br/>\ntry to lay with him first.  Sometimes it works out nice, sometimes <br/>\nthey fight and whine over who I lay with first. <br/>\n<br/>\nTonight&#39;s bedtime went like this: While I was doing something for dd, <br/>\nthe boys got all of the clean washcloths wet, climbed up onto the top <br/>\nbunk bed and cleaned their ceiling fan off.  SIGH!  Then I had to <br/>\nchange the 3 year old&#39;s clothes because he was soaking wet.  The 5 <br/>\nyear old went to get a drink of water from a  cup we had sitting on <br/>\nthe bathroom sink and spilled it.  He cleaned it up, but he was upset <br/>\nbecause he said he hurt his hands on the ice cubes.  And the 9 year <br/>\nold was upset because she thought I layed with the boys too long and <br/>\nshe was tired and wished I could have come to her room sooner.  My 9 <br/>\nyear old and I made up a funny story together, about her stuffed <br/>\nsnowmen.  It&#39;s an ongoing story that we continue each night.  That <br/>\nwas kind of fun.  There was a fly on the wall and the 5 year old <br/>\nwanted me to kill it.  Then when we killed it, I had to find it.  And <br/>\nthe 5 year old&#39;s pillow case came off and I had to put it on, and he <br/>\nfelt the tags on his pillow, some of which seem to be actually inside <br/>\nof the pillow, and he doesn&#39;t like that.  We had to discuss why there <br/>\nare tags on pillows and he wants me to buy him a new pillow that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have tags on the inside. And he wants to know when I will <br/>\nwash his favorite stuffed animal, because the 3 year old threw it in <br/>\nthe toilet tonight and there wasn&#39;t time to wash it before bed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all that, it is really hard for me to just settle down and <br/>\ncontentedly fall asleep.  I need to unwind.  I went into my room for <br/>\na few minutes until I was sure they were all asleep, and then I snuck <br/>\ndownstairs to the computer. :)  I need to unwind and think my own <br/>\nthoughts for just a little while before I can go to sleep myself.  <br/>\nBut I should get upstairs soon, because tomorrow I have promised to <br/>\ngo sleigh riding, bake chocolate chip cookies, buy a new filter for <br/>\nthe fish tank, make a phone call, and find my 5 year old&#39;s directions <br/>\nfor the star wars legos, which he swears is in a &quot;white thing&quot; <br/>\nsomewhere on the booskhelf.  I will probably be able to do all that <br/>\ntomorrow--the problem is that by noon they will have about 10 more <br/>\nthings added to the list that they want me to do.  I cannot do them <br/>\nall and I will start to feel guilty that I am not doing everything <br/>\nthat they want me to do.  There are three of them and one of me.  I <br/>\nam outnumbered! lol <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Stephanie Elms&quot; <br/>\n&lt;stephanie.elms@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; OK.

I think that what is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>getting to me lately is that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I see that he is getting tired, but he is really *trying* to stay <br/>\n </span></blockquote>awake. We have also<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; been talking about listening to your body and what it is trying to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>tell you. But he is fighting<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it...it is turning into a control thing ( which I usually try to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>avoid). Since I have been<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; letting up on controlling him (we gave up tv and food controls <br/>\n </span></blockquote>about 2-3 months ago), control<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  seems to be more of an issue with him, if that makes any sense.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other problem I have is dh. He does not agree with my approach <br/>\n </span></blockquote>at all and thinks that I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; am being a doormat. He has absolutely no problem with expecting <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Jason to stay up in his<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; room after a certain time. He wants to have time to watch his tv <br/>\n </span></blockquote>shows, relax and spend time<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; with me. So I feel like I am trying to balance both dh&#39;s and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Jason&#39;s needs and it is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; not happening.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am not dealing with this well and would appreciate all insight. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tonight I decided that since<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; dh is away until Friday, I would try a new approach. We watched a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>little tv while I nursed<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kyle to sleep. Jason then wanted to listen to the Wizard of Oz <br/>\n </span></blockquote>audio tape we got from the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; library. I told him that I had some cleaning to do, but when he was <br/>\n </span></blockquote>tired to let me know<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and I would go up and lay down with him (thinking that I could get <br/>\n </span></blockquote>some of my needs met<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to get something done and still meet his needs of not being alone <br/>\n </span></blockquote>when he goes to sleep). He<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; said that he was tired around 10 but wanted to me to read to him. I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>said that it was<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; too late for that (I really was tired, but looking back on it, it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>would not have killed<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; me to read a chapter...I think that it was my way of still <br/>\n </span></blockquote>controlling the situation). We<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; went up and laid down.

I am <br/>\n </span></blockquote>also working on getting<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; our living room set up with a tv and comfy couches etc thinking <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that maybe if dh<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; can watch his shows in the family room and Jason stays in the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>living room then maybe<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that will take some of the pressure off.

So I feel like I am trying to balance both dh&#39;s and Jason&#39;s needs and it is <br/>\nnot happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not dealing with this well and would appreciate all insight. Tonight I decided that since<br/>\ndh is away until Friday, I would try a new approach. We watched a little tv while I nursed<br/>\nKyle to sleep. Jason then wanted to listen to the Wizard of Oz audio tape we got from the<br/>\nlibrary. I told him that I had some cleaning to do, but when he was tired to let me know<br/>\nand I would go up and lay down with him (thinking that I could get some of my needs met<br/>\nto get something done and still meet his needs of not being alone when he goes to sleep). He<br/>\nsaid that he was tired around 10 but wanted to me to read to him. I said that it was<br/>\ntoo late for that (I really was tired, but looking back on it, it would not have killed<br/>\nme to read a chapter...I think that it was my way of still controlling the situation). We<br/>\nwent up and laid down. He ended up getting fidgety, getting up for water etc etc etc. I<br/>\nended up losing it. All I want is for him to go to sleep when he is tired! <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not the way that I want to end the day. But I am really struggling with giving<br/>\nup the control thing....I go back and forth between completely seeing his point of view<br/>\n(it sucks to know that my two favorite people are downstairs while I am stuck up here<br/>\nin this room) and completely feeling smothered and feeling like a couple of hours in<br/>\nthe evening to myself is not too much to ask. Having him stay up late makes me feel<br/>\nvery stressed for time...btween keeping up with the house, spending time with hubby,<br/>\nkeeping up with my e-lists (which often keep me sane) and trying to find time to<br/>\nrelax and read and now needing more sleep since Kyle is up so much, I am really going<br/>\ncrazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really need a new perspective here...but I feel like the more that I give up control,<br/>\nthe more Jason pushes and pushes. How do I know when to draw the line? Is it ok to draw<br/>\na line? I kind of feel like I have to draw a line or else I start getting resentful.<br/>\nIs this resentfulness something that I just need to adjust my attitude on or is<br/>\nit a sign that things need to come back into balance. And how do I get them back into<br/>\nbalance if that is the case. I just feel like my personality would make it very easy<br/>\nto swing too far out of balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking for a local gym, rec center or y around<br/>\nhere that would have a program for the kids so I can take a yoga class and they can play<br/>\nand wear themselves out a bit. I am working on making connections in the hs community<br/>\nso that Jason can go to friend&#39;s houses for playdates (I had a great network made up of <br/>\nhis friends but they are all in school during the day now). I am also working on getting<br/>\nour living room set up with a tv and comfy couches etc thinking that maybe if dh<br/>\ncan watch his shows in the family room and Jason stays in the living room then maybe<br/>\nthat will take some of the pressure off. Any other ideas? Any ideas<br/>\nfor tiring an active 6 yo out? Any ideas for helping hubby not take this personally<br/>\nand realize that in 10 years this period of our lives will seem much shorter and less<br/>\nimportant then it does now? Any ideas for eeking out some time to get things done <br/>\naround the house (and please know that I am not expecting to keep the house spotless, <br/>\nbut the clutter gets awful and I start going crazy). <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I just need to make that shift in my attitude, but I am having a hard time<br/>\ndoing it. I did it when he was little, but it is harder now that he is 6...I honestly<br/>\nthought that the bedtime thing would be solved by now. I just feel like I have screwed<br/>\neverything up somehow and turned it into a control issue without even meaning to. <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the frantic sound to this post...I am just feeling very exhausted. I need<br/>\nto go to bed now...Kyle will probably be up in a few hours....<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51440,"nextTopicId":51489}}
