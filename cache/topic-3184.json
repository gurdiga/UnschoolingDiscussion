No Way!!    My 17yo attends both ps/community college under<br/>\ndual enrollment. Yes, she tells me how much she hates me &lt;BG&gt; for<br/>\nputting her thru 13 years of public school. But I didn&#39;t know. 12yo is<br/>\nin first year of hs and seems to be adapting well. 10yo is the reason<br/>\nfor my homeschooling adventure. She is very bright, labelled as gifted<br/>\nbut learning disabled, by ps. After tears, fears, and 4 years I pulled<br/>\nher out of ps. WOW, what a difference! I let her pick her &quot;project&quot; and<br/>\nshe goes to it!    We have grown closer as a family. We have<br/>\ngrandparents, great-grandparents, uncles/aunts, etc. who see the<br/>\ndifference in the hs vs. ps kids. No comments...just awe!    Well,<br/>\nenough rambling!
