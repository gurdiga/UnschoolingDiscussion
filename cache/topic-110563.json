She learned that kind of consideration by having it shown to her.<br/>\n  The other day I was trying to articulate the differences in our house since we moved  to an unschooling lifestyle.  It took us a long while to get to this place because as soon as I thought we &#39;had it&#39;, my understanding would evolve even further.  Anyway, I share this because a friend of mine, who also home schools was asking me what I saw as the biggest advantage to this lifestyle, if I had to pick one, and my answer was relationship.  My kids aren&#39;t just siblings, they are good friend to each other.  Our home school group isn&#39;t just a source of activities like the school at home group was, those in our unschooling group are friends.  My teen girls call me on their cell phones when their out and about to just chat for a bit.  My son pumped gas for his sister the other day because she was in hoes and heels for a special event and he was worried about it being slick.  She surprised him with his favorite candy bar the next day, which he ate for lunch.<br/>\n  I could worry about our cell phone minutes, or that he ate his candy for lunch...whatever.  There was a time when I might have done exactly that.  Now I just enjoy watching my kids have fun.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Ann <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

Some people<br/>\n<br/>\nhave really neat ones, like Walt Disney.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting story below about a believer in &quot;harsh economic discipline&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nwhose children rejected the lesson and went on to live very different <br/>\nlives.  From delanceyplace.com<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been talking a lot on this list about how to spend money on <br/>\nchildren&#39;s wants and needs.  Maybe economic discipline leads to poverty<br/>\n<br/>\nat least some of the time, and not necessarily to good business acumen <br/>\nor happy well ordered lives.  I&#39;m sympathetic to the struggle to keep <br/>\nfinances in order that is evident in Elias Disney, and to the <br/>\ndifficulties this placed on his children to have happy lives growing<br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the story:<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nIn today&#39;s excerpt, we get an indelible picture of<br/>\nlittle seven-year-old Walt Disney.  The year is 1908,<br/>\nthe family is chronically poor and Elias&#39;s--the father&#39;s-<br/>\n-employment is highly unstable.  They are living in<br/>\nKansas, and little Walt is the youngest boy in the<br/>\nfamily--eight years younger than Roy, the brother<br/>\nwith whom he would create the Walt Disney<br/>\nCompany and from whom he will be essentially<br/>\ninseparable throughout his life:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Life on the farm was certainly more pleasant in<br/>\nretrospect than it had been in actuality.  For Elias<br/>\nDisney was a hard man--a believer in physical<br/>\npunishment and harsh economic discipline.  The<br/>\nchildren received no allowances and no playthings<br/>\neither.  For Christmas their presents were practical<br/>\nitems like shoes and underwear.  It was Roy Disney,<br/>\nworking at odd jobs, who supplied Walt and his sister<br/>\nwith an occasional toy and who, as soon as Walt<br/>\nwas big enough to try and handle it, put him on to an<br/>\noccasional good thing.  Mrs. Miller (Walt&#39;s sister) tells<br/>\na story, for example, of Roy&#39;s getting a job washing<br/>\nthe town hearse and allowing his little brother to<br/>\nparticipate in the profits of the enterprise despite<br/>\nWalt&#39;s having spent most of the time playing dead<br/>\ninside the vehicle.  The proceeds were spent at a<br/>\ncarnival that passed through town a little later.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRichard Schickel, The Disney Version, Elephant<br/>\npaperback, 1968, pp. 48-9<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDelanceyplace.com | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:daily@...\">daily@...</a> | Philadelphia | PA | 19102<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!
