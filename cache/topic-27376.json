Some starting points (some of these<br/>\nare schools, but they arent huge institutions and theyre outside of the<br/>\nmainstream):<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 16 (19 years ago) I did a farm apprenticeship on a small family<br/>\nfarm through the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association (MOFGA).<br/>\nDont know whether this still exists.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn college (about 15 years ago) I did an internship in draft animals (mostly<br/>\noxen) and early American farm machinery at the Tillers Small Farm Program,<br/>\nKalamazoo Nature Center, Kalamazoo, Michigan. Visitors came to see - some of<br/>\nthem were Africans looking to introduce these methods to areas in Africa<br/>\nwhere draft animals are not yet used. Another intern built a log cabin<br/>\nsingle-handedly, with hand tools, while I was there.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can make a working solar oven, capable of cooking full meals, out of<br/>\ncardboard, aluminum foil and glass. Ive taught workshops in State and City<br/>\nParks using info from the online Solar Cooking Archives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://solarcooking.org\">http://solarcooking.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHabitat for Humanity might be  a good place to learn building skills. They<br/>\nbuild houses in partnership with low-income people in the U.S. and abroad.<br/>\n(They need other kinds of help more than swinging a hammer, though  all the<br/>\nvolunteers want to do that! Also, theyre mostly Christian and when I<br/>\nvolunteered briefly for them years ago in Americus, Georgia, they would send<br/>\nyou abroad only if you were religious  any religion, but it had to be a<br/>\nreligion. You could volunteer in the U.S. without professing any faith.)<br/>\n<br/>\nShelter Institute and the Yestermorrow School are examples of owner/builder<br/>\nschools. Pop that into a search engine, or see a Department of Energy<br/>\nlisting at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eren.doe.gov/consumerinfo/refbriefs/t311.html.\">http://www.eren.doe.gov/consumerinfo/refbriefs/t311.html.</a> These<br/>\nplaces focus on energy-efficient, easy-to-build structures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe voluntary simplicity movement (try this in a search engine) might be a<br/>\ngood place to find people versed in the truly basic skills (not all of<br/>\nthem rural, but having to do with intelligently using your money and other<br/>\nresources).<br/>\n<br/>\nReal Goods, in Hopland, California, is a company that sells alternative<br/>\nenergy supplies and that is connected to a non-profit organization that<br/>\nteaches workshops on how to build straw-bale houses (dont give me the joke<br/>\nabout the big, bad wolf  some straw-bale houses have been standing for over<br/>\na hundred years), use solar and wind energy, do permaculture gardening, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther things to try in a search engine are Intermediate Technology<br/>\nPublications (inspired by Schumacher, who wrote Small Is Beautiful and<br/>\nSmall is Possible), the Electric Shoe Company (which is developing a shoe<br/>\nthat recharges a special kind of battery using the pressure exerted on the<br/>\nsole in walking), and the book Understanding Pedal Power (you can rig up a<br/>\nstationary bike to power a radio, TV, etc.) Dont have the time to get the<br/>\nlinks right now. If anybody else does, please post.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgricultural extension services like the 4-H might be worth a look. Hmm,<br/>\nwooden boatbuilding schools are another category.<br/>\n<br/>\nIll add more ideas if I think of them. The range is endless and the time is<br/>\nnow. (Why are we bombing Afghanistan? Doesnt it have something to do with<br/>\noil? What if we harnessed the energy of youth  not to mention our own - to<br/>\nthe task of finding ways to overcome our dependence on oil? Wouldnt that<br/>\nfree us to work on the problem of peace?)<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, my husband is looking to work in something like this. Right now<br/>\nhes the manager of a consumer electronics store in Manhattan belonging to a<br/>\nmajor corporation that shall remain nameless. We want out. If anybody has<br/>\nany job leads for us (Im mostly busy with our two-year-old and writing a<br/>\nbook on attachment parenting, but I could maybe work part-time, too), please<br/>\nemail me privately. My husbands got a degree in psychology, for what its<br/>\nworth, and experience in computers and Greek diners as well as the<br/>\nelectronics store. Ive mostly done translating and interpreting, writing,<br/>\nediting, proofreading, teaching English to adults in Spain, environmental<br/>\ned, and alternative therapy for kids under stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nElsa Haas<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"pete","from":"&quot;pete&quot; &lt;plj@...&gt;","profile":"pjesl","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"W8ePJkmcTCT60qMrHtt4wH9kdUugkUXpuMpmaQGQNziRYXboV-Mu8gcycNXxe4SrjkkhwVBdcLcP2MwMmZan","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1561","postDate":"1005741056","msgId":27717,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxYzE2ZDA4JDM1MjcwNDgwJDcxMDQxMGFjQGRlZmF1bHQ+"},"prevInTopic":27399,"nextInTopic":27751,"prevInTime":27716,"nextInTime":27718,"topicId":27376,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey Dan, Pete Jones, Neenah, WI, here.
