You <br/>\nsuggested to pay him a dollar.  I don&#39;t understand the difference between <br/>\nthe two?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOoh, good question. I am wondering now too. I don&#39;t pay my kids to do <br/>\nanything. They get money but don&#39;t have to do anything for it. Even the <br/>\noldest who is 16. I give her money from time to time. She use to get an <br/>\nallowance but once she got a job that stopped. Then she quit her job and is <br/>\nnow looking for another one. No allowance for her but I do give her money <br/>\nfor stuff. She asks to borrow it but I never let her pay it back. She knows <br/>\nshe needs to get a job soon as she has a car coming in the near future. Her <br/>\nwatching the kids or doing anything I ask her to do for me aside from what <br/>\nshe normally does goes unrewarded. Well at least in money terms. We are all <br/>\nrewarded big time in this house!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44915,"nextTopicId":44998}}
