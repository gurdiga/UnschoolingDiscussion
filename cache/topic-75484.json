I waited out their skepticism ~ Hannah, soon 7, began reading her <br/>\nfirst book a couple of months ago.  Suddenly, in the past three weeks (ever since <br/>\nthose teeth started falling out!) she&#39;s been reading about 25+ words from the <br/>\nenvironment, even using context and first letter sounds to figure some out.  <br/>\nThe immediate effect on Hayden has been amazing!
