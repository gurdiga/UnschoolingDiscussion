The teacher in preschool would even make him go all day with <br/>\nhis schools untied, saying he needed to learn to do it himself.  Is this <br/>\nrediculous or what?  They also did a pre K test, and sent the paper home with me <br/>\ntelling me that he wouldn&#39;t be able to attend K this year as he was SO far behind. <br/>\n But at k registration, he blew them away with what he knew.  And for the <br/>\nmost part he did like school, but he tells me he likes our school better   &lt;G&gt; <br/>\near to ear!!!!!!<br/>\n  syndi<br/>\nWe worry about what a child will be tomorrow, yet we forget that he<br/>\nis someone today.<br/>\nStacie Tauscher<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Classic Connections?  was: New and confused.......","postDate":"1069108813","msgId":84940,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwMzExMTcxNDM5MjEuMDI1OTBkODBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDExNS4yYjgwMGE4Yy4yY2VhNzc5NUBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDExNS4yYjgwMGE4Yy4yY2VhNzc5NUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":84935,"nextInTopic":84952,"prevInTime":84939,"nextInTime":84941,"topicId":84933,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
