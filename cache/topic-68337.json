If there&#39;s going to be public school, I think<br/>\nteachers should make $100,000 - BUT, there&#39;s no tenure, class sizes should<br/>\nbe no more than 10 and every student should rate the teacher at the end of<br/>\nthe year. Less than 8 of 10 high ratings - you&#39;re out!<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh salaries might foster competition for jobs and make principals and<br/>\nschool boards carefully select who they want to pay those big bucks to.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t you think someone who sees your kid more hours a day than you do<br/>\nshould be highly valued?
