But that&#39;s assuming the people are already<br/>\nreturning on a regular basis. But what will bring them in the first place?<br/>\nAnd what will keep them coming back to that particular site out of all the<br/>\nother sites on the internet?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you were looking for reading ideas, would the first site you thought<br/>\nof be *this* site? No, regardless of how useful or not categories are, the<br/>\nsite doesn&#39;t offer anything that can&#39;t be found in thousands of other<br/>\nplaces. Organization isn&#39;t the key that will bring people back but unique<br/>\nofferings.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd *which* people does the author want to come back? All homeschoolers? The<br/>\ncontent is way too skimpy. (Check out Ann Zeise&#39;s site<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/\">http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/</a> for something that has mass appeal.<br/>\nIn other words a site needs to be massive to have mass appeal.). All NZ<br/>\nhomeschoolers? There isn&#39;t enough NZ specific content (laws, NZ offerings<br/>\nand such). The Homeschool Association of California<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hsc.org/chaos2confidence.html\">http://www.hsc.org/chaos2confidence.html</a> website is a good example.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe setup *seems* to be offering a small corner on the web for a group of<br/>\nwomen who are drawn by something about the site that calls to them. So far<br/>\nthe only unique thing may be a feeling a kinship with the label &quot;New Zealand<br/>\nHomeschooling Mum&quot; where they&#39;d feel they were likely to get to hang out<br/>\nwith others who also shared that feeling of kinship with the label.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the question is, what would a &quot;New Zealand Homeschooling Mum&quot; like to<br/>\nfind *on the site* once they find *each other*? So first you have to get<br/>\nthem there. (Give some group - &quot;New Zealand Homeschooling Mum&quot;s if that&#39;s<br/>\nwhat you&#39;re going for -- a place that they feel they can identify with.)<br/>\nThen you need to provide the content that will keep them returning. If you<br/>\ncan figure out what it is they want, then they will come to meet each other<br/>\nand stick around.

However, it does not change my opinion or make it less<br/>\n&gt; &gt;valid.  If some one wants to communicate something, they are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;responsible for communicating it in an understandable way and must<br/>\n&gt; &gt;take their audience into consideration if they want to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;understood.  If one were intending to be helpful, then it seems<br/>\n&gt; &gt;logical that one would need to consider their audience even more.  A<br/>\n&gt; &gt;little more difficult on email, but entirely possible if one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;remembers the people at the other end are real w/thoughts and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;feelings.  You said you were asking a question, yet it was worded as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a statement.  Had it been a question, I would not have thought it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;negative.  Posting style differences?  Perhaps, yet when on a list<br/>\n&gt; &gt;where not everyone personally knows each other it seems, as posters,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;we should consider how others might read what we write.  While<br/>\n&gt; &gt;posting style differences do exist, it is my opinion that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;consideration when posting for how others read things could go a long<br/>\n&gt; &gt;way to improving communication.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Kitrina<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Your use of Yahoo!

They are <br/>\nthere so that we can find them when we&#39;d like to, but also to refresh our <br/>\ntired minds when inspiration just isn&#39;t flowing and we&#39;re &quot;bored.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I &quot;organized&quot;  my materials, some were in folders, some in the <br/>\nenvelopes the catalogs came in, and yet others were in crates or in piles on <br/>\nthe floor.

(I&#39;m not oblivious to the fact that my <br/>\nfeeling of being chastised might be me mucking around in my own issues, too) <br/>\n  Anyway, I&#39;m doing my best to unlearn my way out of old convention - a baby <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t just stand up and start to run - there is a process of learning, of <br/>\ntrying and failing, of testing the waters and, perhaps, making different <br/>\nchoices.  It takes a while to build up the strength, stamina, coordination, <br/>\nand determination to tackle the awesome task of walking, and then running.  <br/>\nIt comes most easily with gentle persuasion and encouragement and providing <br/>\na safe environment for the learner to feel comfortable and secure enough to <br/>\nproceed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not directing this comment to anyone in particular, just expressing <br/>\nmyself as a newcomer.
