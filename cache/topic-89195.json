I&#39;ll try put some of what I saw in &quot;schooly&quot; terms:<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce my daughter spent a night creating pets, trying to find unique names for them ... really interesting considering how many millions of pets there are.  Even the most obscure names we could come up with were mostly already taken.  Cool and neat conversation about the &quot;size&quot; of the internet.  My youngest son (he&#39;s 6), spent almost a week playing every day a few months ago.  There are tons of games/puzzles: logic (tetris-like etc), skill (hangman/spelling etc) and luck. Even figuring out which is which is learning.  He loves figuring out high numbers and would play games to rack up his points and they post on the page how many plays the game has had that day (usually always in the thousands).  Then came the strategy of deciding which scores to keep and when to pass and try again (you can always play but you can only take 3 scores a day per game).  Not to mention purchasing food etc for your pet.  You don&#39;t just buy something, you haggle for it. Very fun way to play with numbers ... narrowing in on a final agreed upon price with the shopkeeper.  If you can get it before someone else does!  Tons of logic and math there.  And I could go on ....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course, just seeing the interesting graphics and games and realizing what can be accomplished on the web with some computer programming ... that&#39;s interesting in and of itself!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a bit of food for thought if your daughter does decide to try it out. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164396504,"authorName":"Elizabeth Roberts","from":"Elizabeth Roberts &lt;mamabethuscg@...&gt;","profile":"mamabethuscg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Neopets","postDate":"1074379460","msgId":89201,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTE3MjI0NDIwLjcxMDgyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEyNjAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMzEwMWMzZGQ0MiRlNzY1ZTJlMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":89198,"nextInTopic":89206,"prevInTime":89200,"nextInTime":89202,"topicId":89195,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"DUH!
