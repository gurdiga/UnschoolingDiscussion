I have similar <br/>\nissues with my older son...we are just SO DIFFERENT in some ways I&#39;m s <br/>\nurprised at what he finds interesting and fun and what he doesn&#39;t.  <br/>\nWell, not as much the more I read about unshcooling, his temperament and <br/>\nmult. int.  My younger son however, is much like me and is a <br/>\nHOMEBODY!!!  Balancing my socialite and my hermit is interesting.  they <br/>\nare only 8 and 4 though.   Sometimes I have to say &quot;We are doing this&quot; <br/>\nand one maybe both will enjoy it.  And sometimes one begs to do <br/>\nsomething and I have to say We are staying home today.  I have to try to <br/>\nfind a balance that works for both of them.  It is easier to figure out <br/>\nwhat will be interesting and successful the more I read about Multiple <br/>\nIntelligences....But sometimes I say,  Mommy is interested in this and I <br/>\nneed you to come with me.  Sometimes I play &quot;x&quot; with you even when I&#39;d <br/>\nrather do something else, so now, I need you to come with me even though <br/>\nyou may prefer to do something else.   And it turned out that we found <br/>\nsome common interest at the Art Museum (NOT THAT I EXPECTED TO!!)  <br/>\nSo...some of it may be give and take...you compromise, he compromises....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m new to this and still feeling my way through it.  I feel your <br/>\nfrustration and anxiety.  Sometimes I say,  &quot;Well, Mommy wants to learn <br/>\nabout this, so we are going here.&quot;  AT least that way I&#39;m trying to show <br/>\nthat we are lifelong learners and you&#39;re never too old to have an <br/>\ninterest in something or a desire to learn more about something or try <br/>\nsomething new.  Best of luck to you!!!<br/>\nSusan in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104213,"nextTopicId":104209}}
