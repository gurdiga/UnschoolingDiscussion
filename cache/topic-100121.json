This is not the same as being aware of subjects, something that is hard for me to let go of after nearly two decades of subject indoctrination.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking for subjects, for me, meant that I would be happy to play games like Uno with the kids because it was &quot;math&quot;.  We were &quot;doing&quot; math!  In fact, when I first began unschooling, I thought that it meant learning by playing games instead of learning by doing worksheets.  That was nice and fun, but it wasn&#39;t unschooling.  It was schooling with different tools.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing aware of a subject might mean noticing that a child&#39;s comment on a paragraph in Harry Potter reflects an understanding of the theory of division.  The child may not have any knowledge of the meaning of the word, &quot;division&quot;, yet clearly understands the process of organizing something into smaller pieces, or divisions.  Sure, you can call it math because humans have decided that anything to do with numbers is math, but &quot;math&quot; isn&#39;t the point.  The point is reading something (or hearing, doing, experiencing, seeing something) and making connections in one&#39;s brain.  That is real learning.  The child doesn&#39;t need to know that it can be called division or math in order to have the thought process.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways it is a small, insignificant difference, to say that one looks for subjects vs. one is aware of subjects, but it can make a big difference in getting to unschooling.  If we only see evidence of our children learning when it looks like the school-learning we were taught ourselves, it will be difficult to accept unschooling as a viable method of providing our children with an education.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] back again and discouraged","postDate":"1096824034","msgId":100171,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PGNqbTV2Zis3MTc4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":100159,"nextInTopic":100175,"prevInTime":100170,"nextInTime":100172,"topicId":100121,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-873758149\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  But a lot of textbook math is<br/>\nrare in everyday life (why would a 8 yo need square roots, what the<br/>\nhell is an integer, distributive properties,... ).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is precisely why it is unnecessary.

If I wanted <br/>\nmy kids to fit in at school, sending them to school would&#39;ve been my best <br/>\ncourse.   If I had sent them and found they did NOT fit in whatsoever (which is <br/>\ntrue of many kids, poor things, who have no option to bail), then any fantasy of <br/>\nthem fitting in better by being unschooled would be unrealistic.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling and school are so different that unschoolers can&#39;t simply be <br/>\nplugged back in.  You can&#39;t drop them back on the assembly line as though you <br/>\nnever took them off.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I wanted my 11 year old to be aware of his choices.  He hated<br/>\nit.  He said &quot;the clock never moves, its so boring&quot;, and most of all, he<br/>\nwas embarrassed that he didn&#39;t know the math they were doing.  He was in<br/>\ntears that night because he did not want to go back because he felt<br/>\nstupid. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe couple of times a kid of mine has said &quot;might want to go to school next <br/>\nyear,&quot; I&#39;ve told them then they needed to practice handwriting and formal math <br/>\n(as appropriate) and I&#39;d be willing to help them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-this week I put my kids in<br/>\npublic school for one day-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWas the 11 year old in on that, or was it done against his will?  You don&#39;t <br/>\nneed to tell us, but for me, I wouldn&#39;t put a kid in school cold who wasn&#39;t <br/>\nprepared.  I wouldn&#39;t let one go on his own without trying to coach him toward <br/>\nreadiness for some of the things he missed (mathematical notation and &quot;Don&#39;t get <br/>\nup without permission&quot; kinds of things).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-How do you deal with that; when they don&#39;t measure up to the school kids? <br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of things to say to a question.<br/>\nThe nature of grading and comparisons in school require that 1/3 or more of <br/>\nthe kids who have always been in school &quot;don&#39;t measure up to the school kids.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I have not been pushing the math so he is behind them.  Of<br/>\ncourse, he is ahead of lots of them in reading and other areas.  But he<br/>\ncant see that. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a problem for unschooled kids, particularly from about 9 to 12, I <br/>\nthink.  Joyce and I talked about this with our kids (12, 13, 15) after the Peabody <br/>\nconference and they had some stories too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore 9yo/4th grade, the unschooled kids Do seem to be learning like crazy, <br/>\nand looking at lists of &quot;expected competencies&quot; or what&#39;s expected in those <br/>\nfirst three or four grades shows our kids are just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen for a few years school does some things unschoolers don&#39;t do.  Forced <br/>\ncursive handwriting, maybe (not all schools, and the UK has a &quot;connected up <br/>\nwriting,&quot; I think they call it, that&#39;s more like a simple Italic calligraphy hand, <br/>\nand makes more sense).  Multiplication and division (formally drawn out, <br/>\ncolumn by column CERTAINLY not in one&#39;s head--that&#39;s &quot;wrong&quot;).  History &quot;facts&quot; <br/>\n(more like simplified mythology) about Columbus and the American Revolution (<br/>\nsorry to use U.S. examples, and maybe other English speaking nations have done <br/>\nbetter with their rote beginning history than we have, so disregard this if so).<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, the unschooled kids are still playing games, figuring out math <br/>\ntheir own individual ways in their heads and with toys or whatever, and being <br/>\ncreative and &quot;immature&quot; (by school standards, meaning they&#39;re not involved in <br/>\nshucking off their childhoods or their imaginations), and so that&#39;s the worst <br/>\ntime to compare them to schooled kids or to put them back in school, I think.  <br/>\n(Worst for making unschooling look bad, at least, if not for kids&#39; liklihood of <br/>\nslipping in smoothly.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen when kids are 13 and older, the unschoolers are just starting to blossom <br/>\nwith all kinds of ideas and questions and maybe projects and some kind of <br/>\nphilosophical outreach (some of them, if they have the talents/interests to do <br/>\nso).  They are living in the real world, and starting to care more about what&#39;s <br/>\noutside of themselves.  Their questions are big and good ones.   Their <br/>\nunderstanding of history and science doesn&#39;t look like school&#39;s, but it&#39;s often based <br/>\nin their having started to connect hundreds of dots in their own worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, back in school, 8th graders, 9th graders (translate for <br/>\nBrit-system in your head if you need to, sorry) are about fed up with their <br/>\nnearly-ten-years of forced short-term study/regurgitate/forget, we know you know this, <br/>\njust do it again for practice.   Some of them begin to shut down, or to just go <br/>\nthrough the motions without joy (if they still had any left at that point).  <br/>\nThey become resentful at their lock-up and have all of high school to look <br/>\nforward to.  Not only more of the same, but the teachers start to outright SAY <br/>\n&quot;That history they taught you when you were little was quite oversimplified, <br/>\nhere&#39;s what happened.&quot;   And some of them who read outside of school know well <br/>\nenough that this version is just a higher-level oversimplification.  It&#39;s not real <br/>\nhistory.  It&#39;s an additional layer of facts on the same few myths.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think both &quot;learning curves&quot; (quite a generalization and won&#39;t apply to <br/>\nall individuals) have a flat spot, but for unschoolers I think it&#39;s in the <br/>\nmiddle, when they&#39;re 10, 11ish.  For schooled kids it&#39;s later, when they&#39;re 13 or <br/>\n14 that they stall out a while.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] back again and discouraged","postDate":"1096761825","msgId":100146,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc5LjM1MTQ2N2IxLjJlOTA5YmUxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":100145,"nextInTopic":100158,"prevInTime":100145,"nextInTime":100147,"topicId":100121,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/2/2004 7:07:57 PM Eastern Daylight Time, flyerrod@digital.net writes: ...

I think you know that,  just let it go!<br/>\n <br/>\n ***I find it very difficult to<br/>\nbe creative enough to incorporate math into everyday life on a daily<br/>\nbasis.***<br/>\n <br/>\nThen don&#39;t.  Really.  Don&#39;t incorporate anything.  Just live your lives.  Live them to their fullest, follow what your kids like and want to do and all those other things fall into place. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nThis morning for example, while I&#39;ve been writing this post, my daughter has written a letter with a picture and a message.  She decorated an envelope, wrote and learned about addresses and return addresses, discussed why we need return addresses.  Then talked about why we need stamps and certain things in certain places on an envelope.  She&#39;s 6.   That&#39;s an awful lot of learning in just 30 minutes.  :) <br/>\n <br/>\nIf you want to talk about math, here ya go--  my other daughter (10) doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s good at math.  She thinks her older brother is better at it than her.  Although the other day as I was waiting for her to get some socks on to go walk the dog, she decided to fill in the blanks on a multiplication table.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe had written out one, months ago.  She wanted to know some multiplication so I drew one up for her.  I started filling in some numbers and then she said, &quot;Stop! I want to do it now.&quot;  She didn&#39;t finish it right then,  worked a few and then put it down. <br/>\n <br/>\nSpeed up to our dog walking day, she goes up to get socks and sees the table and wants to finish it.  I always thought doing a multiplication table was fun, kind-of like a puzzle.  That&#39;s what she thinks, and that&#39;s what she was doing and had  to do at that moment.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs I was waiting downstairs for her, I yelled up to her, &quot;are you coming on the walk?&quot;  Her reply, &quot;yep, just a minute I&#39;m figuring out multiplication, but I&#39;ll be done in a minute.&quot; :) Really, if you have someone willing and able, you can learn an awful lot of math in a very short amount of time.  (Right Pam &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n <br/>\nYour children might not learn math everyday. They might not learn English or other subjects everyday.  But you know what, when they do learn them, they are in realistic moments.

Read more, read more about deschooling.  Have you read lots of Holt&#39;s writings?  Have you read lots of unschooling books?  A lot of books written on the subject are by people who once didn&#39;t think in unschooling ways.  And then they saw the light.  &lt;g&gt;  You can too!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOh and also,  maybe one of your children isn&#39;t going to be a math wizard,  maybe they won&#39;t have a head full of math concepts.  That&#39;s OK.  Trust them to learn what they need.  That&#39;s an integral part of unschooling. They might instead have a whole head full of dance steps, or musical notes,  or strategies from video games.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to trust your child and you might be able to do more of that if you step away from those school thoughts. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t give up!  If you have wanted to do this for 5 years, it must be making some important connections for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPS.  One last thing-- you said: <br/>\n***Please tell us you dont do it all perfectly.***<br/>\n <br/>\nWe don&#39;t.  We all make mistakes and fall short sometimes.  For me its when I&#39;m tired or feeling impatient.  But I&#39;ve learned to breathe through those moments.  Knowing that this is the best and only way I want to live my life keeps me going.
