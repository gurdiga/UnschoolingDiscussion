I don t know when you might have most recently visited Germany, Ned.

As I see it, Germans will need many more generations to overcome<br/>\n&gt; their unspeakable shame at being such obedient, horrific sheep.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Growing up, I knew a man from Austria who told of the &quot;old (Prussian) army.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; There, the motto was, &quot;Let the horse think !&quot;  In other words, &quot;Do what<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re told -- don&#39;t think for yourself !&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know when you might have most recently visited Germany, Ned.<br/>\nHowever, I live in Germany right now, so I&#39;d like to address a couple of<br/>\nthese statements.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I see people jaywalking regularly.  German culture is much more<br/>\nproper and formal than American, but they&#39;re really not *that* uptight!  I<br/>\nhave also observed that the horrors of the Third Reich are not unspeakable<br/>\nto Germans today.  They speak of them, they have created art to represent<br/>\nand memoralize them, and they live with the problems of being blamed (still)<br/>\nby the world for something they personally had no part in.<br/>\n<br/>\nGermany has changed since you were growing up, Ned.  That&#39;s a number of<br/>\nyears ago, now.  I spent several days in the former East Germany and also<br/>\nEast Berlin this summer.  Can you tell the difference between the West and<br/>\nEast?  Yes.  By the buildings.  But not by the people.  It&#39;s only been a<br/>\ndecade.  But the people have changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, the German school system is still the envy of many a country, if<br/>\nnot America.  German children attend school only in the mornings, and their<br/>\neducation includes many things eliminated in American schools: art,<br/>\nswimming, music, etc.  The schools here are not perfect, by any means, but<br/>\nit&#39;s still a good education.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My purpose was not to create unnecessary fear<br/>\n&gt;among our troops, but to point out that the reason school employees treat<br/>\n&gt;homeschoolers with disrespect, distrust, disdain and often contempt is that<br/>\n&gt;they see us as their enemy...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just for the record, I have encountered very polite, respectful people in<br/>\nthe schools here.   Furthermore, I don&#39;t think that your above statement<br/>\ndescribes my parents, who have now each dedicated 50 years of their lives to<br/>\npublic education.  We may disagree on my son&#39;s education, but I know that<br/>\nthey have made a positive mark on many children&#39;s educations.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are fully entitled to your opinion, Ned.  However, I personally have<br/>\nbeen offended by some of your sweeping generalities.  I hope that you can be<br/>\nopen to the idea that very few concepts are as black and white as you are<br/>\npainting them.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40498,"nextTopicId":40500}}
