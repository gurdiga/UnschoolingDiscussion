I didn&#39;t know the RIGHT definition of unschooling and felt <br/>\nthat my attitude was pretty much in line with unschooling when joining the <br/>\nlist. Unfortunately the exchanges I&#39;ve had have been frustrating to me in <br/>\nsome sense (partially because we&#39;re going thru my mom having leukemia/cancer <br/>\ntesting and a huge financial blow - that makes anyone a bit sensitive I think <br/>\nand I know it has affected my take on things here) yet the information here <br/>\nhas also been very helpful.<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned that there ARE different levels of unschooling, however, there <br/>\nis a True Unschooling Method and THAT is what I am not. I am eclectic and <br/>\nthat&#39;s just fine by me.  I have difficulty with making sure I&#39;m doing <br/>\nsomething within a certain paradigm, for example being sure that I am doing <br/>\neverything in the unschool manner according to one author. (My opinion only, <br/>\nnot meant as criticism at all.)<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind learning that my understanding of unschooling is wrong. It helps <br/>\nme personally to have a sense of the options out there, how others that are <br/>\nhomeschooling are doing it, and what goes on in other homeschoolers&#39; homes on <br/>\na daily basis. Its great to get that insight and have that kind of support.  <br/>\nI feel that I don&#39;t fit in here because I&#39;m not an unschooler as has been <br/>\npointed out in answer to my posts and some of Kate&#39;s.  THat&#39;s cool by me, <br/>\nthere are lots of other groups out there and we can all find what is right <br/>\nfor each of us.  Good luck on the wording of the description, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll <br/>\nget it right and it will be easier for newbies to know if they are in the <br/>\nright place without disrupting the community that is here =)<br/>\nKristine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34360,"nextTopicId":34385}}
