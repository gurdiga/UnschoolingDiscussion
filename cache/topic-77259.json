(I seem to have missed the original of this.) Maybe you mean when I<br/>\npoint out that a tantrum is the last resort of a child who isn&#39;t being<br/>\nheard. They&#39;ve gone through the skills they know to tell us they want<br/>\nsomething and we&#39;re ignoring them or not taking them seriously or not<br/>\nunderstanding. They don&#39;t have anything left but to melt down in supreme<br/>\nfrustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we tried to tell our husbands we were hungry or tired and they ignored<br/>\nus, dismissed us, and told us to stop complaining for what felt like *hours*<br/>\nwe&#39;d likely melt down too!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a parent waits until the tantrum happens to try to understand what the<br/>\nchild wants, the child can learn that a tantrum is an effective means of<br/>\ncommunication. They can learn to skip over the other ways of communication<br/>\nand go straight to tantrum.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn standard parenting practices that translates into ignore the tantrum so<br/>\nthey don&#39;t learn to use tantrums to &quot;manipulate&quot; the parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter -- *much* *much* better -- is to learn to listen to the child and<br/>\npick up the cues he&#39;s using to try to communicate before it ever gets to the<br/>\ntantrum point. Then offer help or at least understanding. It may not avoid<br/>\nthe additional frustration of not getting their needs met, but at least<br/>\nthey&#39;ll feel they&#39;re being heard and their needs are understood and taken<br/>\nseriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd additionally thinking ahead to the types of things that cause melt downs<br/>\nand preventing the situation in the first place, like making sure they&#39;re<br/>\nwell fed and rested before going shopping, maybe having a little bit of<br/>\nmoney to spend or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Which doesn&#39;t address the highly sensitive child who may have frequent<br/>\nmeltdowns because of frustrations with life in general.
