You hear people remark that if this is global warming then global warming great! No snow anymore! <br/>\n<br/>\nNot a clue of how vulnerable we are, not even a consideration.

Obviously, in your region the climate used <br/>\n  to be slightly different. People got used to putting there warm <br/>\n  clothes up in February and getting their spring stuff out.  The fact <br/>\n  that you can&#39;t rely on the weather to cooperate anymore IS a symptom <br/>\n  of global warming.  <br/>\n  I wish they would find a better word for it.  People seem to think <br/>\n  that it means every place on the planet will get warmer <br/>\n  simultaneously.  That&#39;s not what is happening.  The overall average <br/>\n  temperature is rising (and no reputable scientist says otherwise <br/>\n  anymore).  This is causing climate CHANGE.  Some areas may even get <br/>\n  cooler.  Some like Ohio will get less predictable but milder overall. <br/>\n  Storm patterns will change.<br/>\n  And the problem is that some people cannot disassociate the debate <br/>\n  over WHETHER it is happening (even the Rebublicans are starting to <br/>\n  admit it) from the one about WHY it is happening.  And the majority of <br/>\n  average citizens don&#39;t understand a lot of what they read about it and <br/>\n  don&#39;t take the time to investigate it fully to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n  Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
