It doesn&#39;t have to be 80 degrees out.  The<br/>\nbeach is beautiful when it is 50 and sunny.  The sand is warm and the wind<br/>\ngives you healthy rosy cheeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuild a campfire in your yard (might need a permit) and toast marshmallows<br/>\nor make smores. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlay a board game or a card game. <br/>\n<br/>\nWrite a story.
