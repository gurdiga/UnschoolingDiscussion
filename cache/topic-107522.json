Our favorite for the entire family is Calvin and <br/>\nHobbes.  I love the snowmen and little bits of Shakespeare.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother great series that combines comic books and a chapter book is <br/>\nCaptain Underpants.  I found the comics helped my now 10 year learn to <br/>\nread.  They are filled with words spelled incorrectly yet the way they <br/>\nsound like they should be spelled.  Steven made several of his own <br/>\ncomics inspired by this series.  If your child enjoys the books, check <br/>\nout the website.  It includes a comic book autobiography.  The author <br/>\nwas told many times by his principal and several teachers that he <br/>\nwould be a failure in life.  He has written several other series for <br/>\npreschoolers that are very funny.  My youngest enjoys his Ricky <br/>\nRicotta series.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nBarb in VA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107521,"nextTopicId":107523}}
