She said something about our kids having their special ways <br/>\nthat can be a thorn in our bonnet at times.  She said something about how <br/>\nnothing is accomplished by nursing our inconveniences and offenses.  We <br/>\nshould focus our energy on what our child needs, put aside our emotions and <br/>\nguessing &quot;why&quot; they are that way and work at helping them.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said it more simply but it&#39;s my best effort at paraphrase.  I know I blow <br/>\nit when I &quot;think&quot; about it all too much.  I get frustrated because I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave the answers, no magic bullet.  The poster really helped me get my focus <br/>\nback, concentrate on helping them get through the moment, help them fulfill <br/>\ntheir needs.  Stop looking for a blanket solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve lost count of these moments I&#39;ve had here, reading the wisdom shared <br/>\nhere.
