They had to be home by 10pm every <br/>\nnight, as that was when I wanted to be done for the day and I needed <br/>\nto know where they were before I could be done.  They complained, of <br/>\ncourse, but now they tell me about all the stuff they got away with <br/>\nanyway.

Your friend may feel horrible about <br/>\ntaking control, but everyone will be grateful in the future.  My <br/>\nregret is that my older son got caught up with a Dungeons and Dragons <br/>\ncrowd.  I met most of them and knew there were some older people <br/>\ninvolved.  My son had a level head and was a good kid. The crowd <br/>\nincluded a 28 year old woman who latched on to my son when he was 17 <br/>\nand half.  Unfortunately I was swayed by the male influences in my <br/>\nlife at the time who thought is was cool for him to have such a <br/>\nrelationship.  I wanted to call the police for child molesting, <br/>\nsomething I certainly would have done if he&#39;d been a girl and she a <br/>\nman.  He found out she wasn&#39;t so great of a person and when he tried <br/>\nto break free, she manipulated him with suicide threats.  He didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow how to handle this and never asked for advice.  We didn&#39;t know <br/>\nthis was happeneing as he was no longer living at home.  Eight years <br/>\nlater he&#39;s married to a nice woman closer to his age, but he&#39;s still <br/>\ninvolved with the ex daily, as they are sharing custody of the 2 year <br/>\nold produced as a last attempt by her to keep him.<br/>\nWhile it may seem heavy handed, your friends should follow their <br/>\nhearts which may include putting retrictions on Dan.

I was not certain <br/>\nwhat to tell her so I thought I would ask her question here, everyone here <br/>\nalways have lots of good ideas! <br/>\n<br/>\nI will try to keep this short. The problem is that my friend feels that her <br/>\nson (age 15) runs around with a group of boys (ages 17-19) that she feels is <br/>\nhave become a determent to her son. Her son Dan began to run with them late <br/>\nlast school year. Dan is unschooled but has been in and out of public school <br/>\nseveral times over the last 6 years at his request. His parents are very open <br/>\nto what he wants to do. They have also allowed him much freedom to run around <br/>\ntown (pop 1500) at all hours which may be how he hooked up with the older <br/>\nkids. His Mom thought the older boys were ok at first, kind of mouthy she <br/>\nsaid but she thought they were just kids having fun. Now she is not so sure <br/>\nsince Dan has begun to smoke tobacco, has a bad attitude, swears profusely, <br/>\nand may be drinking alcohol. Dan is an only child. His main problem has <br/>\nalways been not having many friends. But he is very likable, my kids always <br/>\nliked being with him, but we live 68 miles from him so could not see him <br/>\noften. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas would be appreciated. I have not had to deal with this type of <br/>\nproblem myself so I am not sure what advise to give. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nCandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26591,"nextTopicId":26585}}
