But I have seen my sister in law recently go through<br/>\nbreastfeeding problems (challenges!!) that really opened my eyes to how much<br/>\nof an unbelievable challenge it can be.  She had all kinds of support ( her<br/>\nMidwife, My wife who is also a Midwife, and a lactation consultant) but she<br/>\nstill says labout was nothing in comparison to the emotional challenges of<br/>\nthe first couple of months of breastfeeding.  Since then I have noticed many<br/>\nother of my wife&#39;s clients with similar challenges.  It can be a enormous<br/>\nchallenge, and, for instance, if my sister in law had not been successful at<br/>\nsurmounting all her challenges, I would NEVER hold it against her... even if<br/>\nit was medically possible.  I think that by saying there are only 1-2% of<br/>\nwomen who cannot breastfeed that it invalidates the experiences of so many<br/>\nwomen who have such extreme challenges, which may come from a variety of<br/>\nsources...   The last thing a woman needs after deciding it is too<br/>\nchallenging for HER to breastfeed is a whole lot of guilt.  On the other<br/>\nhand, I am completely in favor of promoting breastfeeding as the first<br/>\nchoice, and providing all the support and information that can be provided<br/>\nto make the chances of success as high as possible.<br/>\nJust another mans openion....<br/>\n(I feel funny chiming in on this topic as a man... but I have been reading<br/>\nthe posts for a long time... and I feel I shouldn&#39;t hold back my thoughts<br/>\njust on account of my gender)<br/>\nJoshua<br/>\n<br/>\ncheck out www.alladvantage.com to get paid to surf the net.<br/>\nMY user ID# is LUZ-400<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Sonia Ulan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sulan@...\">sulan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 10, 2000 2:25 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] A father&#39;s view<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello, one and all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s time for another father to speak to this issue.

As our babies have nursed, I have often found myself<br/>\n&gt; drawn in by the beauty of what I am seeing, and lay down beside my wife<br/>\n&gt; and baby to cuddle them both.  Quite a change for a formerly insensitive<br/>\n&gt; and self-centred jock!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I consider myself to be essential to my babies&#39; breastfeeding also, for<br/>\n&gt; the simple reason that I make it possible for my wife to break away from<br/>\n&gt; some of her tasks to have quiet time to nurse our babies.  Of course, I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t do this when I&#39;m away at work, but when I&#39;m home, it&#39;s my greatest<br/>\n&gt; pleasure to enable my babies to nurse.  Then, I have made the time to<br/>\n&gt; bond with our babies by changing their diapers, dressing them, walking,<br/>\n&gt; rocking, bathing and napping with them, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From a purely financial standpoint, I can only say how grateful I am<br/>\n&gt; that nature has provided breast-milk for babies.  I don&#39;t know HOW we<br/>\n&gt; could ever have afforded the $1,500.+  it would cost to bottle-feed a<br/>\n&gt; baby per year.  Furthermore, I don&#39;t really think that a father bonds in<br/>\n&gt; the same way by bottle-feeding a baby, that I have in participating in<br/>\n&gt; the breast-feeding of our babies.  My father bottle-fed me, but he still<br/>\n&gt; never learned to be sensitive or emotionally intimate with his children.<br/>\n&gt; He simply FED me.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In summary, I cannot express adequately just how wonderful an experience<br/>\n&gt; it has been for ME to be part of our breast-feeding team.  Like Sonia, I<br/>\n&gt; understand that there are those 1-2% of cases where breast-feeding is<br/>\n&gt; not possible for medical reasons. But I strongly encourage it for all<br/>\n&gt; the other fathers, if it&#39;s at all an option for them......<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Damian.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ron and Stephanie wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; My DH was the one that started this whole thing by being uncomfortable<br/>\n </span></blockquote>about<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; breastfeeding.
