And I <br/>\ndid not fail to gently mention, &quot;Look at those kids in school, while WE are <br/>\ngoing to the beach,&quot; as we passed by. We rented tapes of sea chanteys and <br/>\ndrew lifesize whales (in chalk) in the street and  went to a museum to see <br/>\nseascapes and visited a &quot;tall ship&quot; and on and on. We had a great time and <br/>\nRoya was thrilled and could absolutely see that this was REAL learning as <br/>\nopposed to wasting her time in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd - she was worried about friends, so I put a big calendar on the <br/>\nrefrigerator and made playdates for her, in advance, and put them, along with <br/>\nGirl Scout meetings and soccer practice times, on the calendar. That was <br/>\nenough for her - knowing that she&#39;d still have time with friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI let her finish school because she was happy there - it was ME who could see <br/>\nhow much better things could be - I was the one with the homeschooling <br/>\nvision, not her.
