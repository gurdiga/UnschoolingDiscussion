We fought our<br/>\nhealth insurance to pay for birth control, and then later for the more<br/>\n&quot;permanent&quot; version of such.  They didn&#39;t want to....but they&#39;d be happy to<br/>\npay for 9 more babies if I wanted to have them!  Well, duh!  Babies are a<br/>\nlot pricier than birth control!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as health insurance for a 20 year old, a couple ideas.  First, can<br/>\nyou &quot;create&quot; a homeschool and enroll him fulltime for the insurance<br/>\ncompany&#39;s benefit?  Probably a stretch, tho.  Also, check with your regular<br/>\ninsurance carrier (car, home, etc.) about short-term health insurance<br/>\npolicies.  They&#39;re generally a bit pricey, but designed for the between jobs<br/>\nor between school and jobs sort.  I had one a few years ago and even used<br/>\nit, and it was decent coverage.  I think mine was through Thrivant, but most<br/>\ninsurance agents could probably steer you in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41089,"nextTopicId":41074}}
