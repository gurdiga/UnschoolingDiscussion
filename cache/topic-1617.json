I have some brochures somwhere around here on it.  <br/>\nHis estate is right next to the Henry Ford estate, they were big time buds.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live about 45 minutes from Edison&#39;s birthplace her in Milan, Ohio.  it was <br/>\nso cool to tour his house and see his family treasures and learn from a guide <br/>\nabout his family.  We are doing a unit on Thomas edison right now using <br/>\nBeyond five in A Row as a guide.  We are reading Thomas Edison, Young <br/>\nInventor.  it is easy reading or the boys and they are enjoying the cool <br/>\nacitvities we are doing.  Sometimes I need a lot of help being creative and <br/>\nB5IAR is a great guide for me.  The boys wanted a summer of science and <br/>\nagreed Thomas Edison would be the man to study.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are going to build door bells, code buzzers, a light bulb, and an electric <br/>\npen.  Along with all of the cool science experiments we are going to be doing <br/>\nfor the fun of it!  Everything is done informally and as we get the chance.  <br/>\nAnd they are happy that they are not being forced to do math and workbooks <br/>\nand stuff like that anymore, hahaha.  And oddly enough, they are not fighting <br/>\nme on doing any of this cool science stuff either....why, they are actually <br/>\nenjoying it I dare say :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, it is time to go waterproof some wood and figure out how long it <br/>\ntakes for sound to reach our ears.  if the boys like, maybe we will even <br/>\nstart on sign language.  who kows what the day will bring....<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all of the info on the Indy Museum... and the other things to see <br/>\nthere!  The Cleveland Science Museum is really cool too, but it doesn&#39;t seem <br/>\nto compare to Indy&#39;s.  Ahhhhh, checking my calendar.....<br/>\n<br/>\nKim in Ohio</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1611,"nextTopicId":1636}}
