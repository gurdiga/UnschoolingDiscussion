Nothing is good or fun when you&#39;re depressed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust around the corner is a time when your kids will be bigger and won&#39;t<br/>\nneed you so much.  You had those years before they came and you&#39;ll have<br/>\nthose years when they&#39;ve moved on.  You will have time to yourself again.<br/>\n It&#39;s not forever that they&#39;ll need you the way they do now.  There is<br/>\noxygen and open space out there waiting for you!&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFigure out a way to get an hour to yourself every day.  Take a walk in<br/>\nthe evening, send them out somewhere with a partner or friend, lock<br/>\nyourself in the bathroom with your favorite music and smelly soap. <br/>\n<br/>\nBetter than just an hour to yourself, exercise.  If you can go to the<br/>\ngym, or take a yoga class or go belly dancing, do that.  Exercise is an<br/>\namazing attitude adjustment.  I&#39;ll do a plug for yoga especially, there&#39;s<br/>\nnothing like it.  You&#39;ll feel like a different person.  Go to a class and<br/>\nabsorb the calmness and the energy of the other people there.  Better<br/>\nthan drugs!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore they can ask you to dive into one of their not so stimulating (to<br/>\nyou) projects, ask them to dive into one of yours.   Ask for their help<br/>\nin what you&#39;re working on if you can find a way.  If you read, see if<br/>\nthey&#39;ll make you some pretty bookmarks.  If you draw, see if they&#39;ll<br/>\nsharpen your pencils.  If you sew ask them to paint some fabric for you. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you strive to do really fun things with them that you enjoy too, then<br/>\nthe things they need your help with that aren&#39;t wildly trilling for you,<br/>\nwill seem thrillinger. &lt;g&gt;  If you create time together that&#39;s really<br/>\nfulfilling for *all* of you, you yourself will take more pleasure in the<br/>\nlittle things your kids do.  It opens them up to you in new ways.  It&#39;s<br/>\nbonding and patience building.   And when you&#39;re sitting at the computer<br/>\nwaiting through the &quot;and, and, and&#39;s&quot; &lt;g&gt; you can think about the way<br/>\ntheir shining faces looked when you were in the pool together or sliding<br/>\ndown the hill together or jumping in the mud puddle together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be hard on yourself.

Here&#39;s my dilemma: sometimes I feel like a really bad<br/>\n  unschooling mother.  I want to stimulate my children and do things for<br/>\n  them, and at the same time, it seems to require so much of a &quot;servant&quot;<br/>\n  attitude--just waiting around to help them all the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Here&#39;s an example: My kids (10 and 7) often want to dictate stories to<br/>\n  me.  I sit at the computer and type their stories.  Their stories are<br/>\n  WONDERFUL and really show me evidence that they&#39;re learning and are<br/>\n  creative, but sometimes I just feel like their SERVANT -- just sitting<br/>\n  there waiting for them to tell me what to write.  Quite honestly, it<br/>\n  can get boring, even though their stories are INCREDIBLE and I&#39;m<br/>\n  always glad I&#39;ve done the work when they&#39;re finished.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Here&#39;s another example:  my 4-year old will ask me to get software<br/>\n  started for her.  I know that she wants to learn and I should jump up<br/>\n  from what I&#39;m doing, all smiles, ready to stimulate her mind, but I<br/>\n  want to continue doing what I&#39;m already doing.  The constant pestering<br/>\n  me to do things for them and to assist them in their learning<br/>\n  efforts can drive me BATTY.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Then, I feel really guilty because I&#39;m not more giving and selfless<br/>\n  for my children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] being a bad unschooling mother","postDate":"1073993889","msgId":88658,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJDMjk0MkQxLjIzMUVFJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJ0djNlOCtoNmliQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":88655,"nextInTopic":88670,"prevInTime":88657,"nextInTime":88659,"topicId":88621,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Hiring a<br/>\nteen on a regular basis to be with them for the afternoon, taking an evening<br/>\nclass once a week, getting up early to do things you find are spiritually<br/>\nrenewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may feel resentful at the end of a break because you feel like you need<br/>\nhours and hours of that. Accept that feeling as normal. You may need to<br/>\nschedule more breaks or accept that you&#39;ve denied yourself for so long that<br/>\nyou&#39;re starving and it&#39;s going to take a while for a little bit at a time to<br/>\nfeel like it&#39;s making a difference in the vaccuum inside you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo, find some strategies for re-establishing the bond between you and your<br/>\nchildren. The feelings you&#39;re having are causing you to pull back and you<br/>\nneed to consciously reach out and open yourself up to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra says she smells her kids hair.

But what I need to do is<br/>\nhug her. It&#39;s okay for me to need not to be touched. But it&#39;s not okay to<br/>\npush her away because her need to be hugged is much more important.

If you need some time to yourself, by all means, pop in a movie or turn on the Discovery channel or whatever you are comfortable with, make use of them,  and take a breather.<br/>\n===========================================<br/>\nGosh. I have to say that post really hit me, too. Mostly, it was one of those moments where I found myself saying, &quot;I have no response to that.&quot; And I always have a response! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only really positive thing I can suggest to this poster is to find more time and space *after hours* to recharge her batteries. After dh comes home, I take some time on the computer or look at a magazine, veg in front of Lord of the Rings for the thousandth time (of course, every one gradually migrates to where I am anyway &lt;g&gt;). Mom&#39;s night out once a month with other homeschoolers has been a lifesaver for me. I would really stress *after hours* though--after you&#39;ve been helping them and they&#39;re in bed or happily playing with dh or each other. I know unschooling doesn&#39;t happen within a set number of hours, but I think that while kids are awake and needing you or asking for your help, you need to be able to be there to offer that without resentment. Not that you can&#39;t get a mother&#39;s helper, but unschooling is fundamentally about being available for your children. If you&#39;re finding that you can&#39;t be available (emotionally, physically) for whatever reason, then I think you need to address why that is. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also not so sure I&#39;m comfortable with the tv as babysitter kind of approach. Yes, I do it myself when cooking dinner or having some one on one time with dh &lt;eg&gt;, but not in lieu of actually being available to my children. And I&#39;m not saying anyone is neglecting her kids by putting on the tv. It just seems to me that the tv needs to be a choice that the kids are making among other stimulating choices, not because they have nothing better to do or no one to play with, know what I mean? <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know. The original post really rubbed me the wrong way with its resentful tone: &lt;&lt;The constant pestering me to do things for them and to assist them in their learning efforts can drive me BATTY. &gt;&gt; That just reads wrong to me. Sounds like more than just mommy burn out. Maybe Susan hit it on the head when asking about an article or research.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] being a bad unschooling mother","postDate":"1073980056","msgId":88652,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMxMEY0REYwLTQ1OUMtMTFEOC04MzBDLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAyMGYwMWMzZDlhMiQ2ODhkMzVjMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBBbG95c2l1cz4=","referencesHeader":"PGJ0djNlOCtoNmliQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDIwZjAxYzNkOWEyJDY4OGQzNWMwJDY0MDFhOGMwQEFsb3lzaXVzPg=="},"prevInTopic":88651,"nextInTopic":88655,"prevInTime":88651,"nextInTime":88653,"topicId":88621,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I don&#39;t feel like a servant, but I do feel the need for space and perspective at times. I think that may be what you are describing.  I&#39;ll explain what has worked for us, but it is still developing and changing and will continue to change as my daughter gets older.  Here goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI work from home running my own business, and I have to (HAVE TO) have blocks of uninterrupted time to work. It was almost impossible when my daughter was younger but we still made it work, and it does get better.  I think the key for me has been to do as much as I can while still making it work.  If this means it doesn&#39;t perfectly correspond to someone&#39;s theory, so be it; sometimes you have to go for the greater good.  Again, I am speaking just for me. You have to honor your feelings of being sucked dry also and find ways to refill yourself.  It&#39;s easier with one child, granted, but I have had great success doing this with more than one also.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn days when I absolutely must have a chunk of time to work during their waking hours, and I need at least 3-4 hours a day, I usually set up, for lack of a better word, stations near my work area.  New library books in one spot, a craft area, beads, etc., a computer game CD already loaded and ready for a double-click (i&#39;ll change it on a break, which I do briefly every 15 minutes or so), a batch of blank audio tapes and a recorder, a story on tape, a video, play doh, whatever I can think of that they are into or would be if exposed to it.  Today I left out two laundry baskets and my daughter amazed me by playing with them for - I kid you not - 7 hours.  One was fun before, but two? I don&#39;t know why I never had two out together before.  Even putting out a roll of masking tape is excitement itself to my daughter.  Anyway, my point is that I trust her to amuse and educate herself, have always done so, and she can keep herself going if offered enough opportunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is also because I am not always immediately available right at the second she wants to know something that she has to use a bit of ingenuity to figure some things out.  Today, for instance, she wanted to know how to spell &quot;witch.&quot;  She knew I had just started working, so she thought of a book that had a witch in it, found the book, and then found the word so she could copy it.  She did this entirely on her own.  If you want to extricate yourself from some of the doing-for, you might put a POSITIVE spin on this aspect of your unschooling, that you are encouraging self-direction. :) I happen to think children need some space to discover ways to improvise, to come up with plan B or C because plan A is not available.  I used to type stories for my daughter also, but something she enjoys MORE is making her own little books with folded pages and staples and her own illustrations. Maybe your kids would enjoy creating their own books as well, if you could provide them with the materials.  If they are not interested enough in creating stories to do it themselves, maybe that&#39;s a sign to put typing stories on the back burner and help them discover things they really DO care enough about to initiate or develop themselves.  Whenever I find myself doing most of the work of learning or creating, I question whether my daughter is getting anything other than my proximity out of it -- which of course is sometimes enough, but I hope you follow what I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething I also do to make sure neither of us feels deprived of each other is to plan blocks of time during the day that are just for my daughter, broken up by work.   By doing this, my daughter is to a certain extent working around my schedule, but it is what is working, after much trial and error, that allows me to earn an income and thus be able to be home and homeschool at all.  She is happy, I&#39;m happy, my husband loves returning to a happy home every day so I figure that&#39;s what counts to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you that you need time to yourself.  I don&#39;t think you should feel guilty about that, if you do.  When I need time to myself and I absolutely cannot get it that day, I try to think of things that we can do together that would provide renewal for me.  I have even made lists so if I am frayed that day I won&#39;t yell or overreact to her demands for me and can choose something I thought of in a more rational moment.  I might ask her to sit in my lap and read to me while I rock and take a 15 minute rest (eyes closed).  She likes to &quot;do&quot; my hair with clips and bands and such, and she is very gentle, having done it since she was 3, and I might suggest she do this, which requires very little interaction on my part (just checking the do after each one and hearing the name she has given me for that do) and is very soothing to me, like a scalp massage).  Another thing that allows me to actually nap (sometimes) is when she burys me with anything soft (stuffed animals, blankets, pillows, etc.).  It always takes about 30 minutes for her to tire of this, and gives me a very refreshing 15-20 minute nap every time.  Going to the library at least once a week to let her find books and play the games at the library computers also gives me time to sit in a quiet place and read, something I never have enough time for.  This is all, to me, part of unschooling.  I find I have to renew myself periodically, and at times daily, to be able to give to my child.  Your activities with your kids will of course be different, but I hope this gives you some idea of what we do and that it helps you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this is the kind of thing you are looking for that will help; I hope so.  I&#39;ll add one more thing.  I have to say that the very best thing I ever heard (Sandra Dodd?) was that it was okay for children to watch television.  I do monitor what is watched, but to have unschoolers defend video-based learning was incredibly revolutionary for me.
