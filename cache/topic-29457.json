Yes, we do lots of fun things where I know they <br/>\nare learning about all sorts of things, including letters and numbers.  <br/>\nBoth of my boys are continually asking questions and that&#39;s how they <br/>\nseem to learn the most.  They are very inquisitive.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe play games like Dominoes, Clue Jr., Scrabble Jr., My First Rummikub, <br/>\nand other games like that.  They enjoy it all.  And, I know they are <br/>\nlearning from them.  My husband, unfortunately, is still at the point <br/>\nwhere he would like them to do some worksheets (ugh!!).   So, we do <br/>\nthem.  I don&#39;t know what else to say.  I know this is an unschooling <br/>\ngroup and I believe I know the unschooling philosophy inside out, but my <br/>\nhusband is part of this family too and I guess we are accommodating him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like confrontations or arguments.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve me, he has come a long way.
