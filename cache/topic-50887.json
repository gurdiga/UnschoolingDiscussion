NHEN, in partnership with<br/>\nAmazon.com, would like to make it all just a little easier for you.<br/>\nMaybe you&#39;re looking for that great new cd for your father-in law. Or, how<br/>\nabout the Harry Potter LEGOs for a favorite niece or nephew? Or an electric<br/>\nteakettle for your tea-loving sister? Or, maybe even a great new<br/>\nhomeschooling book for you to curl up with after the rush of the holidays?<br/>\nDid you know that Amazon.com sells all these things, and more? Housewares,<br/>\ntoys, electronics, music, toiletries, and, of course, books and more books!<br/>\nMany orders over $25 qualify for free shipping. Sitting at your computer,<br/>\nyou can purchase, then have sent, gifts for your immediate family, or for<br/>\nfamily members across the country. You can even include a personalized gift<br/>\ncard and have your gift specially wrapped. What could be simpler or more<br/>\ncost effective?<br/>\nWhen you shop at Amazon.com, via NHEN&#39;s home page, you can get a great deal<br/>\nand help support NHEN at the same time. Just go to NHEN&#39;s website<br/>\n(www.nhen.org), click on the Amazon link on our home page, and &quot;shop till<br/>\nyou drop.&quot;<br/>\nOr, go directly by accessing our Amazon shopping page at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org/cgi-bin/amazonxml/amazon_products.pl\">http://www.nhen.org/cgi-bin/amazonxml/amazon_products.pl</a><br/>\nWith each purchase NHEN will receive a percentage of the sale. This adds up<br/>\nto a significant contribution that will support the important work NHEN<br/>\ndoes for homeschoolers around the world!<br/>\nBut wait! Now that you understand what a great idea this is for NHEN<br/>\nmembers, think of the even greater impact you could make if you forwarded<br/>\nthis e-mail to all your Amazon-loving friends and family so they could<br/>\nsupport NHEN too. Just forward, or copy and paste, this message, and send<br/>\nit on its way.<br/>\nRemember, though, it only counts for NHEN if you shop through our Amazon<br/>\nconnection!<br/>\nHappy shopping!<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50885,"nextTopicId":50892}}
