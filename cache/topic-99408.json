It was back in the days that I didn&#39;t know that there <br/>\nwere so many types of homeschoolers.  I guess I never gave it much thought that <br/>\nhs&#39;ing could look so different in homes across this country.  Well,.......  we <br/>\ngot there and immediately knew we were different when they scheduled &quot;mass&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;service&quot; or whatever they called it.  Went to dinner (very formal) that <br/>\nnight and lo and behold...  Rob and Cindy at my table.  Hmmmm....  a UU at a <br/>\ntable with the head honchos.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe cruise was a week long and I went to most of the discussions and classes <br/>\nand learned a lot.  For the first time in my life I discovered that folks use <br/>\nthe bible in their teaching and make their kids sit down with text books and <br/>\nworkbooks.  I chuckle when I think of myself in that grand hall timidly raising <br/>\nmy hand and shouting out that I was amazed that they used the bible and I had <br/>\nnever thought of it as a historical document.  I&#39;ve always internally <br/>\nclassified it as historical fiction.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son had a great time.  I learned a lot about people, didn&#39;t make any <br/>\nlasting friendships but was invited to South America to work with a missionary <br/>\nfamily for a summer.  (What an interesting mix that would have made, <br/>\nfundamentalist and an agnostic)   My hubby spent almost the entire week in the infirmary on <br/>\nIV&#39;s he was so sick.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow about Costa Rica for a get together?  I&#39;ll skip another cruise!<br/>\n<br/>\nTeenaNH<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  Rain, rain....  go away!       Thanks again Sandra for your hospitality <br/>\nthis summer!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99363,"nextTopicId":99409}}
