Finally she quit w/ a few digs and a no <br/>\nphone calls till after the holidays. I am cold, calculating and insecure b/c <br/>\nI won&#39;t discuss our choices. Discuss? Huh gets yelled at and cursed at is not <br/>\ndiscussing. Thus I am cold. If I truly believed in what I was doing I&#39;d <br/>\n&quot;discuss&quot; it. UGH!<br/>\n<br/>\n     I am sick of it.
