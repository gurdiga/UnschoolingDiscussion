Women, especially, share.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are email lists that don&#39;t allow any actual real personal <br/>\ninformation - it is ALL about theories. I find those incredibly boring <br/>\nand useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut many of us learn by telling our stories to each other and working <br/>\non them together - we chew on them - we dig for the bigger principles <br/>\nat work, we figure out how we feel about things by talking about <br/>\nreal-life situations. Although we post specifics - true anecdotes and <br/>\nsituations - it is the underlying basics that we really focus on. <br/>\nThat&#39;s how we learn from each other. I post that my kids sing all the <br/>\ntime - at the top of their voices - they LOVE to sing. You may not have <br/>\nsingers, but you may have a kid who plays the radio loudly all the <br/>\ntime. Or kids who just use really loud voices. At the same time my <br/>\nspecific issue is looked at, perhaps in some depth with differing <br/>\nresponses, people will be comparing and contrasting it to other <br/>\nsituations that they&#39;ve faced. Two of the most important things we&#39;ll <br/>\ndo will be to see how general unschooling principles apply to this <br/>\nspecific situation and to see if general unschooling principles can be <br/>\ndeveloped out of this specific situation. Either way - it is all useful <br/>\nanalytical discussion. NONE of it is about us all somehow determining <br/>\nwho is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;good&quot; or otherwise. None of it is personal. None of <br/>\nus have any authority over each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, we have simply found that if it is all hypothetical, it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have that ring of truth to it that makes it so real and useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou didn&#39;t share much, to be honest. I didn&#39;t get any sense from your <br/>\noriginal posts of what your decision-making was like, what your <br/>\nrelationship was like, etc. Without that context, people&#39;s responses <br/>\nwill be more shots in the dark - so keeping in mind that they may be <br/>\nuseful to somebody else, you simply need to either ignore what doesn&#39;t <br/>\nfit or expand on your situation more so that the conversation can be <br/>\nmore focused, if that is what you&#39;d like.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not, your comments might be the starting point for a discussion that <br/>\nwill expand and branch out in directions that are no longer even <br/>\nrelevant at all to your own situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way, NOTHING written is really about any individual - we know so <br/>\nvery little about each other (most of the 1600+ of us, anyway), that <br/>\nwe&#39;re all just responding to what WE get from what others write.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake what you can use - if something provokes thought, consider it a <br/>\ngift. Ignore the rest - unless you feel like questioning it or adding <br/>\nto it or expanding upon it or disagreeing with it - or, in other words, <br/>\nanalyzing it yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 17, 2005, at 12:14 PM, Susan Buchholz wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi all.
