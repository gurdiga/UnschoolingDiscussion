Meera, by the way, is doing just fine!  She is an<br/>\nextremely talented gymnast (spends about 20 hours a week at the gym),<br/>\nhas taught herself to play the flute at an extremely high level, is<br/>\ncurrently working her way through Mozart&#39;s 23rd Piano Concerto, and<br/>\noccasionally (though only occasionally) opens a book.  She reads well!<br/>\nit&#39;s just that she has decided she has better things to do with her<br/>\ntime!<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the beginning of the year, Meera started taking band with the local<br/>\n5th grade.  About the 5th week in, the teacher decided she should teach<br/>\nthe other kids (she herself had never had even a single lesson) -- well,<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t allow this to go on very long, got her moved to 6th grade<br/>\nband, where she is bored, and stays in with promises that she&#39;ll be in<br/>\nthe 8th grade band next year.  (she&#39;s only 9)  Meanwhile, she may have<br/>\nbeen the only kid in Washington state enrolled in recess! Recess<br/>\nfollowed band, and she wanted to go to the schoolyard with her friends,<br/>\nso they made us enroll her (allows the school district to capture<br/>\nrevenue! and they think it helps them with liability, though I can&#39;t<br/>\nfigure out how.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, my younger is very different from my older one, but the way we go<br/>\nabout meeting her learning aspirations does not differ in any<br/>\nsubstantive way.  My wife no longer delivers newspapers (she&#39;s still a<br/>\nmassage therapist) -- she now cares intermittently for Alzheimer&#39;s<br/>\npatients in their homes, and has lots of fascinating information to<br/>\nbring home!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; overall i felt it was honest and fascinating, especially your ability<br/>\n&gt; to utilizes your community because this is an area i am very weak<br/>\n&gt; at.   but when you have a child whose interests lay well outside your<br/>\n&gt; own, in your case music and in mine robotics, looking toward the<br/>\n&gt; community would be the next logically step.  i think you covered the<br/>\n&gt; &#39;how to&#39; part very well and you showed just how exciting life can be<br/>\n&gt; when a family embrace learning as a lifestyle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks!
