(and<br/>\nbesides, there&#39;s nothing like one&#39;s *own* bed and snugglies &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d been home about ten minutes when the phone rang. It was Jim, just<br/>\nchecking to make sure I&#39;d made it home safely. Mark said it was his<br/>\nthird call, and on his call before that he&#39;d said he was giving me<br/>\nanother half hour before he started out looking for me.
