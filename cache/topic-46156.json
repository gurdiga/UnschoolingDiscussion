I have always asked that she brush her teeth,<br/>\nget dressed, and make her bed in the morning&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell lucky for me, I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve run into any hygiene problems as I see <br/>\nit with my kids. (so far!) My kids never get dressed unless we are actually <br/>\ngoing out somewhere. My baby wears onesies to bed and the middle 2 wear long <br/>\nt-shirts and the oldest sometimes nothing at all. (okay, she gets dressed!) <br/>\nMy kids go outside in the back and front like that. I don&#39;t see it as a big <br/>\ndeal. If we&#39;re having company, I ask that they put pants on. It usually <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t last. Once one of them goes to the bathroom, the shorts come off. I <br/>\nsent my girlfriend a video tape of our family and we were all hysterical at <br/>\none scene of us all in the backyard releasing a bird we nursed back to <br/>\nhealth. None of the kids had pants on and my oldest daughter&#39;s best friend <br/>\ndidn&#39;t either!!!! We&#39;re pretty relaxed here and luckily the people who visit <br/>\nare okay with that. If they weren&#39;t, they can stay home!!! At least we have <br/>\nsomething on!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as making the beds, what&#39;s the big deal really? I make mine, none of <br/>\nthe kids do. The 3 younger ones really don&#39;t make such a mess when they <br/>\nsleep so pulling up the comforter is fixing it. My oldest sleeps like she&#39;s <br/>\nfighting with someone. If someone is coming over, her room is the first one <br/>\nseen from the dining room, I close the door. It&#39;s her room. If she likes it <br/>\nthat way, okay. My sons room is a disaster at times, as long as I can get in <br/>\nto dust and vacuum, I let him go. One can&#39;t possibly see his room unless you <br/>\ngo right into it. He&#39;ll go for weeks and all of a sudden it will be all <br/>\ncleaned up. Of course it gets messed again, but what are kids rooms for???<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I see dressing and bed making as nothing that &#39;needs&#39; to be done. As far <br/>\nas the teeth brushing goes, I would try something to make sure it got done. <br/>\nMaybe just educate her on what could happen if she stops brushing. Get <br/>\npictures.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;One more question, while I&#39;m at it.  How do you all deal with<br/>\ndisrespect?  Talking back, raising her voice to me, stomping,<br/>\nslamming doors - she gets very frustrated when things don&#39;t go &quot;just<br/>\nright&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell this is much more trickier. I&#39;m sure a lot of people here will give you <br/>\ndifferent advice on this one. With my younger ones, I haven&#39;t run into many <br/>\nproblems with this. They are 2, 6, and 7. When someone talks to someone else <br/>\nin an unacceptable manner in this house, that person is taken aside and <br/>\ntalked to as to why they did it, how they felt or feel now and so on. It&#39;s <br/>\ndiscussed, but at the same time, they are told that it is not acceptable to <br/>\nus all. No TV gets taken away or video games or anything like that. I can <br/>\nhonestly say my younger 3 have not been punished. We discuss and try to talk <br/>\nabout the why&#39;s and if we get no where at the time, we try again at a later <br/>\ndate. Never more than a day later.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow my oldest is a different story. She has always been in school so her <br/>\nupbringing is totally different than the other 3. She&#39;s 16 now and <br/>\nabsolutely fantastic first of all!! When she was 10-13, it was getting <br/>\ntough. She was punished. We tried taking away everything from the radio to <br/>\nher allowance. It never made the slightest difference to her. The only thing <br/>\nthat got to her, was not being allowed to go out with her friends. She was <br/>\ngrounded for one night and if that didn&#39;t work it would be 2 nights. It <br/>\nnever got past two nights and we only had to do it maybe 3 times at the <br/>\nmost. She had an incredible temper and she was taught to go outside and <br/>\nscream or to her room and punch or throw pillows. That helped her. Talking <br/>\nto her at these moments was a big no no. It had to wait until she calmed <br/>\ndown. Sometimes that was quite awhile. She was also a big door slammer. It <br/>\nwas very annoying and with 2 little kids in the house too, not a good thing. <br/>\nWe finally told her that we would take the door off it&#39;s hinges if she did <br/>\nit again. Gave her other ways she could get out her anger and the doors <br/>\nstopped slamming.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am in no way saying these were right things and even that I would go <br/>\nabout doing it all like that again. There are many things I would try <br/>\ndifferently if those problems came up with any of the other 3 kids. I think <br/>\ntaking a breath, choosing your battles wisely, (like bed fixing and dressing <br/>\nas opposed to teeth brushing and mouthing off) and talking and talking and <br/>\ntalking to your child is the best way to go. Respect them like you would <br/>\nwant someone to respect you. I know they aren&#39;t thinking like an adult, but <br/>\nI am amazed at how far you can get by reasoning with a child. I am learning <br/>\nevery day how to handle situations with my children. And there is an awful <br/>\nlot of very good advice here to be found. It just takes time and trust and a <br/>\nlot of patience!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Need advice about child&#39;s responsitilities...","postDate":"1034370347","msgId":46165,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDExMjEwNTQ3LjY3ODg1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGFvNzJsMitlN2lqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46156,"nextInTopic":46176,"prevInTime":46164,"nextInTime":46166,"topicId":46156,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Christine,  I have the same issues with my daughter and son.

I also grew up the same way.    For me, its helped to just let them vent, at the moment.  and then when they&#39;ve cooled down, we talk about it.  I tell them how I used to feel when I was learning things.<br/>\nMy kids love to talk with me about what I went through as a child,  especially when its things they are experiencing.<br/>\nMy parents never talked with me about it and I just had to deal with it on my own, hence, I think I really kept alot inside.  Never learned that most things in life take practice,  gee..<br/>\nIt seems like if we just take a little extra time and talk with them about it and do a little explaining (when they want to hear it) it really helps.<br/>\nAs far as chores,  we have also had those issues but I have also learned to just relax alot about that, not important enough to me to keep on them.  If they have a friend over I might suggest picking up and I&#39;ll help.  They can then play better, find things better,  and not lose things.  But I let them decide,  also with brushing teeth,  education about it is really  all I do.<br/>\nFor most of it I have to just relax, relax, relax!<br/>\nKelli<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n luv2unskool &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cmr0523@...\">cmr0523@...</a>&gt; wrote:We have been unschooling our gifted 9 year old daughter for about a <br/>\nyear.
