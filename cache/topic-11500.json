Our premiums were $300 a <br/>\nmonth and then a co-pay of $15.  My kids go to the doctors about once a year, <br/>\nif that and it seemed such a waste of money.

Our car insurance covers us if we are in any <br/>\nkind of accident, whether it&#39;s my fault or not and people we visit own their <br/>\nhomes and have home owners insurance so the only other accidents or medical <br/>\nissues would be like apendicitis.  We felt that self-pay was the better way <br/>\nto go in our case, as our kids just don&#39;t seem to get sick (touch wood).... <br/>\nMax has never been sick since he was born and he&#39;s 10 months and Zak&#39;s had 2 <br/>\nvery bad colds and that&#39;s it in his 5 years.
