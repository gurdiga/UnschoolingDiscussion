I <br/>\nhave thoughts that might be of some help and I think they go along with what <br/>\na few others have said.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to see the movie so many are loving and hating because I wanted to <br/>\nunderstand a little more about the bible, about the times that are writen <br/>\nabout. I have a hunger for learning. Over the past week though I have <br/>\ndesided that for now it has no place in my life, or my childs.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything we read and watch influence us and change us, even if we do not <br/>\nwant them to or think they do. Do I need to see all the blood, the pain, the <br/>\nhate? No. I am having a hard enough time in my own life with my health. <br/>\nSomeday, I may feel ready to see this movie but for now I do not need it&#39;s <br/>\ninfluence in my life, in my mind. My child is just that, a child, and I <br/>\nbelieve that it is my job to put happy growth into her life for her to grow <br/>\nfrom and form a stable base on. She has enough things to deal with. I want <br/>\nher to see the positive sides of faith for as long as possible. I am not <br/>\ngoing to lie to her, as I do not lie to myself, bad things happen. But I <br/>\nchoose what effects my life and I do not need all that negativity in it <br/>\nright now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Religon, it has killed more people in the world then anything else I <br/>\ncan think of. Not even going to think about what ones have done more harm <br/>\nthen others. I just pray that one of these days people will be happy enough <br/>\nin their own faith that they will stop forcing it on others. All of us here <br/>\nunschool, it is a way of life, what we believe in doing, how would we feal <br/>\nif someone tried to take it from us? I am proud to be an american, and an <br/>\nArmy wife, because we can stand up for our freedoms to believe and live and <br/>\nlove as we chose as long as we cause no harm. My husband and I are willing <br/>\nto fight and gives our lives for freedom. Freedom of religion is one them, <br/>\nand so I am free to not see that movie, and I am happy about it! Someday I <br/>\nam sure I will see it. For now, I have enough to think about and feel.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Just my thoughts.<br/>\n   Blessings,<br/>\n   Kimberly<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nLearn how to help protect your privacy and prevent fraud online at Tech <br/>\nHacks & Scams. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://special.msn.com/msnbc/techsafety.armx\">http://special.msn.com/msnbc/techsafety.armx</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91654,"nextTopicId":91669}}
