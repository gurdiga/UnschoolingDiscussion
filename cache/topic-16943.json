I can&#39;t believe how much he&#39;s learned since he&#39;s left the public <br/>\nschool system and stopped taking Ritilan. Our day is pretty much dictated by <br/>\nwhat he wants to do and he always wants to learn something or do something. <br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing how much your kids will learn when it&#39;s not being crammed down <br/>\ntheir throats. We live in California where the laws are pretty relaxed about <br/>\nhomeschooling, so I&#39;m not tied down to any specific cirriculum or test <br/>\nrequirements. Oh the freedom!! <br/>\nOne of the coolest things about our new situation is that my Andrew teaches <br/>\nme something new every day!  I can&#39;t say enough good about homeschooling--for <br/>\nus, anyway. My 15-year-old could never homeschool. She&#39;s an honor roll <br/>\nstudent, cheerleader, student body treasurer and all around social butterfly. <br/>\nThank God for differences.<br/>\nMy  husband was not convinced that this is the best thing for our son until <br/>\nour middle daughter called my son from work last week to get technical suport <br/>\nfor their computer because a whole office full of adults couldn&#39;t figure out <br/>\nhow to restore the icons on the desktop!<br/>\nHave a great day from sunny California!
