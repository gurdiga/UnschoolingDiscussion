This <br/>\nwould be a great opportunity for you, your husband, and your boys to see HOW <br/>\nunschooling works. You will be inspired by the voices here and from the <br/>\nmessage boards. You can learn the who&#39;s, what&#39;s, when&#39;s, where&#39;s, and why&#39;s <br/>\nof unschooling---and your husband could even challenge our speakers! They&#39;re <br/>\nALL prepared to answer your (and HIS ) questions. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be funshops and activities for all ages. There will be grown <br/>\nunschoolers and parents of grown unschoolers to reassure your husband. It&#39;s <br/>\ndoable; it&#39;s joyful; it WORKS!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you will consider joining us!<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://schoolsoutsupport.org/&quot;\">http://schoolsoutsupport.org/&quot;</a>&gt;Click here: School&#39;s Out Support&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy, Coordinator<br/>\nSchools Out Support<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coordinator@...\">coordinator@...</a><br/>\n803-776-4849<br/>\nFax: 803-776-7006<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org\">http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42576,"nextTopicId":42561}}
