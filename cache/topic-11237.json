I felt compelled to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1921823562\">_____Sonia,<br/>\nI am generally a lurker here and have not even been doing thayt much lately<br/>\nas we prepare for our fourth child&#39;s arrival.  I felt compelled to respond<br/>\nto your post since our toddler has also had more than her share of croup<br/>\nepoisodes.  And she has gotten it last summer as well as this summer!<br/>\n    The virus causing croup is the same one that cause laryngitis in older<br/>\nchildren and adults.  Because its a virus,  it will need to run its course;<br/>\nthough treating the symptoms is important!<br/>\n    You are correct that cold air is one treatment and steam a second.   Our<br/>\nphysican explained that the reason cold air is the first treatment chioce is<br/>\ndue to the fact that it will reduce the swelling in the tracheal area of the<br/>\nthroat.  Steam (cool air, if possible....warm if need be)  can help also.<br/>\nThe difficulty lies in the fact that your child&#39;s airway can be potentially<br/>\nblocked from the swelling,  making breathing impossible if not difficult.<br/>\nFor this reason,  the late night ER may be your best option.<br/>\n    We try a cool humidifier for 10-15 minutes during summer months.   If<br/>\nbreathing remains labored and the barking cough is still present,  we zoom<br/>\nth ethe ER.   Last summer,  our dd did require steroid treatment to reduce<br/>\nthe swelling  and keep her airway passage clear.<br/>\n    Our dau also has tracheo-laryngeal malaysia,  a generally<br/>\nnon-threatening condition in which the thrachea and larnyx are not fully<br/>\nopen.  This condition is something which she will,  indeed almost has,<br/>\ngrown out of.<br/>\n    The croup virus is particularly harder on her because of her smallr<br/>\nopening.  The specialist who diagnosed her told us that many children have<br/>\nthis condition,  but it is often undiagnosed because it doesn&#39;t particulary<br/>\ncause any problems or even strong symptoms.  (For dd,  her breathing as an<br/>\ninfant was &quot;too loud&quot; to me,  especially when she was asleep.  I was<br/>\ninsistent with our physician that this was &#39;odd&#39;  and,  had it checked<br/>\nfurther because it related to such an important function as breathing!)<br/>\n    Best of luck to you!  Summer croup is really scary!!<br/>\nSusan___________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nHi Everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nI need some good motherly (Or fatherly!) advice.  My 22 month old has<br/>\ncroup again.  My other two children never had it and in my family I grew<br/>\nup in none of us ever had it, so I&#39;m not overly sure how to treat it.  I<br/>\nknow about the steam and taking the child out into the cold air trick<br/>\nbut this is summer so what do I do?  Also, when he&#39;s had it before (this<br/>\nmight be his 4th episode), it&#39;s always happened at night and by day he&#39;s<br/>\nfine.  This time it started at 8 this morning and is continuing through<br/>\nthe day...is it going to get worse tonight yet?  He seems basically<br/>\nfine, is not breathing with great difficulty, just wheezing alot.  We<br/>\nall do have bad colds right now so it&#39;s extra tough for him breathing<br/>\nwhen he&#39;s so congested.  Any advice, information or tips please?  I&#39;d<br/>\nappreciate anything anyone has to offer.  A friend in the past told me<br/>\nto try homeopathy and I did try a couple of doses this a.m. and it did<br/>\nnot seem to help at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 20<br/>\n   Date: Sun, 16 Jul 2000 18:27:47 -0400<br/>\n   From: &quot;aworthen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aworthen@...\">aworthen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: help please!<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia,<br/>\nIt sounds to me like this is more than a simple case of croupe. It sounds<br/>\nlike asthma. I would suggest you talk to your pediatritian about getting him<br/>\ngoing on some asthma meds (prob. albuterol and cromolyn mix) via nebulizer.<br/>\nI am an asthmatic mom of three asthmatic children and believe me when I tell<br/>\nyou, diagnosing and treating asthma at a young age can mean much less<br/>\ntreatment and probs. I was not dx&#39;d until this year and I have a lot of<br/>\ndamage to undo. All of my kids were dx&#39;d early on in life and 2 out of the 3<br/>\nonly need meds when they have colds . Please talk to your dr.<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Sonia Ulan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sulan@...\">sulan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, July 15, 2000 5:13 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] help please!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I need some good motherly (Or fatherly!) advice.
