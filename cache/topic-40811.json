Our deal with him is that 10% goes to the<br/>\nchurch, 10% goes to long-term savings and the rest is &quot;expendable&quot;.  He buys<br/>\nbirthday presents for his friends out of it (usually about 5 euros per), and<br/>\nlast year he bought all his own Christmas presents, plus whatever things he<br/>\nwanted.  He&#39;s become very good at budgeting, and generally has 10+ euros<br/>\naround at any given time.  I gave up some control by giving him an<br/>\nallowance, so if he doesn&#39;t buy what I think he should, that&#39;s MY problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your daughter spends her money on something and then wants something else<br/>\nlater in the week, you may want to let her live without it.  It&#39;s the same<br/>\nsituation we grownups find ourselves in.  If I choose to spend money on<br/>\ndinner out one night because I&#39;m too tierd to cook, and a week later some<br/>\nfolks want to go out for lunch, I may have to forego if I don&#39;t have the<br/>\nfunds.  As your daughter becomes accustomed to the idea that the &quot;bank of<br/>\nMom&quot; isn&#39;t going to bail her out, she&#39;ll probably become better at<br/>\nbudgeting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s so important for kids to learn to manage money -- both to save<br/>\nand to spend.  It&#39;s ok to buy junk sometimes...*I* buy junk at the grocery<br/>\nnow and then, why shouldn&#39;t my son!  We just have to learn to not buy ALL<br/>\njunk!<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40810,"nextTopicId":40812}}
