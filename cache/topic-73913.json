Dustin told him to knock it off and that he was a typical public <br/>\nschooler bully.<br/>\nHe was upset that they where being mean and began to cry. The boy told him to <br/>\nrun home baby.<br/>\n <br/>\nToday the other boy called him an F***ing A** hole and the Zack kid smashed <br/>\ninto his bike and messed up his front end.<br/>\nDustin came home all upset and told me. With in 15 minutes the nice boy <br/>\nJarred came by and told him to come back over. I explained nicely (Jarred stutters <br/>\nwhen he gets nervous so I was really talking softly) that I was concerned <br/>\nabout what was happening and I want to make sure Dustin isn&#39;t being treated <br/>\npoorly.<br/>\n <br/>\nTHEN.. the two other boys showed up and I told them that I was NOT going to <br/>\ntolerate ANYONE touching him or his property. That we choose to Homeschool <br/>\nbecause of bullies and public school crap and I&#39;ll be darned if I am going to <br/>\nallow it or put up with it.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe kid Zack is sitting on his bike with a shit eaten grin on his face. I <br/>\nsaid ZACK do you think this is funny??? I said as a matter a fact if I see or <br/>\nfind out this has continued I will be visiting your parents and oh by the way <br/>\nmaybe you both should go home and tell your parents exactly what I have said and <br/>\nif they would like to discuss this have them come by I would love to talk with <br/>\nthem! <br/>\n <br/>\nThey left and later told my son I was a witch, lol. Then I guess the father <br/>\nof the nice boy told them that if they couldn&#39;t be nice that they should stay <br/>\naway also. <br/>\n <br/>\nWho knows what will happen now. I actually stayed out in the yard with <br/>\nCassidy and Nicholas waiting for a parent to come by (pulled then in the wagon, not <br/>\nstood and waited). I know who they are so no surprise to me.<br/>\n <br/>\nI really hope this doesn&#39;t continue.
