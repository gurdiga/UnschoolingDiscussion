Does that description sound like unschooling? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was asked of the following description.  I hope you didn&#39;t make that <br/>\ngirl stop doing what she was interested in to &quot;do math,&quot; I don&#39;t care how <br/>\nmuch sun was shining.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Now that I&#39;ve said that, I&#39;m thinking about my 15 year old daughter. <br/>\nShe is a voracious and very good reader. Better at reading than I am, <br/>\nand I&#39;m a GOOD reader. Because I am a Tolkien fan, I introduced The <br/>\nHobbit to her when she was seven. She ate it up. At age 10, she read <br/>\nLord of the Rings. She read it again. She immersed herself in Middle <br/>\nEarth, checking out books of artwork by various artists, writing <br/>\nabout the strengths and weaknesses in the different characters of the <br/>\nbook, and of course, spent lots of time online chatting with other <br/>\nTolkien people, and looking forward mightily to the release of the <br/>\nmovie. I let her &quot;pursue her interest&quot;...and she followed it into <br/>\nMedieval Europe, and British History. She knows who William the <br/>\nConqueror was, who was King in Britain when he landed. She knows what <br/>\nthe people were called who lived in England before the Saxons came. <br/>\nShe knows all about Arthur and Gueneviere and Camelot. She has read <br/>\nall of Shakespeare&#39;s comedies, and is right now reading through <br/>\nCanterbury Tales...again. She walks around speaking in different <br/>\nEnglish accents: Scottish, Irish, Australian, Cockney, Liverpool. A <br/>\ntrue Anglophile, and it started at age 7, with The Hobbit.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes.  That&#39;s how unschooling works.<br/>\nAnd math can work that way too unless parents prevent it from doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;My younger ones aren&#39;t proving to <br/>\nbe so verbally oriented. They do love their &quot;screen time&quot; though! <br/>\nMovies, computer games, movies again. Seems mindless to me. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo they know more about those things than you do!<br/>\nIf you hang out with them and see what they&#39;re actually doing and thinking <br/>\nand sharing, you will not think &quot;mindless&quot; anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they see you reading this, does it look to them like you&#39;re just staring <br/>\nmindlessly at a computer?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;This has turned out way long. Sorry. I&#39;m more thinking aloud than <br/>\nanything.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother excellent unschooling tactic!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Isn&#39;t unschooling about NOT &quot;providing <br/>\nan education&quot; but simply allowing kids their head, letting them go <br/>\nwhere they will? Where does guidance and provision come into play?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you and your husband met have you guided and provided for one another <br/>\nin any way?  Or did you just make your vows and each allow the other to go <br/>\nwhere you will, separately, alone?  If you have a friend with a similar <br/>\ninterest or hobby, do you share information or help?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;What I meant by illiteracy is an overall inability to do basic skills <br/>\nneeded to have a life.&gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nWe know. &lt;g&gt;  Often the answers here are given in a plain and literal way for <br/>\nthe purpose of showing you what you said in the stark plain vanilla way it&#39;s <br/>\nhard to see when you&#39;re the one doing the agitated thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;Robby&#39;s not telling time, for instance. I really want him to know analog <br/>\ntime...and he gets the general idea of it, but has to rely on digital clocks <br/>\nto know what time it is. I hate <br/>\nthat. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow old is Robby?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the sweetest things among my kids was that the boys could only read <br/>\ndigital even up to the time when their younger sister could tell time, but <br/>\nshe could only read analog.  So when they were somewhere and  needed to know <br/>\nthe time, she might be the one to read it to the boys, or they might read it <br/>\nto her, if it was digital.   That taught them a LOT about learning and <br/>\nknowledge and the futility of depending on age for knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, for various reasons, they can all tell time on all KINDS of clocks.  <br/>\nThey understand military time without effort.  I didn&#39;t teach them.  Had I <br/>\nnot just told you there was a time when they were &quot;behind&quot; (not behind <br/>\nthemselves, behind the imaginary &quot;them&quot;) and limited, and if you met them and <br/>\nasked them the time,  you would never EVER know they weren&#39;t born telling <br/>\ntime (unless you thought about it and realized that everyone learns it in the <br/>\ninstant that they learn it, and no sooner and no later).<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Katie isn&#39;t there yet, though we have been doing phonics <br/>\nthis year, and she&#39;s 8 and a half. I&#39;m confident it will come in <br/>\ntime, but it really is like holding my breath,&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPhonics has been done to death. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nPhonics was &quot;done&quot; before any of us were born.<br/>\nPhonics, like mathematical notation, is an analysis of some everyday <br/>\ninformation, written out in secret-style notation.<br/>\nEnglish has sounds, but Katie knows English.  She just needs to figure out <br/>\nhow to read that clock, and whether she reads analog first or digital, she <br/>\nWILL learn to read English just like reading a clock.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you want her to do it merrily and with no trauma whatsoever?<br/>\nAny book he misses reading while she&#39;s nine, she can read when she&#39;s ten or <br/>\ntwelve, but she probably won&#39;t want to by then, or others will have read it <br/>\nto her, or she&#39;ll be beyond the ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;ike the one article <br/>\nwhere a son didn&#39;t read until age 14! ack! ...&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was Liam, right?  Wasn&#39;t he 16?  He&#39;s 18 now.  He was over here last <br/>\nweek and he&#39;ll be here Tuesday.  You wouldn&#39;t know he was a later reader if <br/>\nyou met him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis mom, Carol, got her first critical response to that article last week.  <br/>\n(I won&#39;t send her your &quot;ack!&quot;)  The teacher who wrote to her said her <br/>\nchildren must have missed some classic literature, and she named Clifford <br/>\nbooks.  Are Clifford books classic literature now?  Are there messages in <br/>\nthere that a warm and loving homelife could totally leave out!?  Or are they <br/>\njust better than other books at a similar &quot;reading level&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;The goal for my teachers in fourth and fifth grades was to have students <br/>\nwho knew their times <br/>\ntables. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut few of them and many adults have know idea what the &quot;table&quot; means in <br/>\n&quot;times table,&quot; or what it all really MEANS.  It&#39;s something people <br/>\nregurgitate without thought or real learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54263,"nextTopicId":54487}}
