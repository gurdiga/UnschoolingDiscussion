If another person comes up to me and says that children <br/>\ncan&#39;t learn without being pushed, I will not only scream, I will run madly <br/>\ninto the night, which of course would only give rise to the misconception <br/>\nthat unschoolers love to run screaming into the night. <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the dilemma, as I see it, is people can judge a group by meeting one <br/>\nperson from that group. They might decide, for instance, after meeting a <br/>\nfamily whose kids are playing Nintendo during “school hours” that video <br/>\ngames are all that family does and that video games are all unschoolers do, <br/>\nperiod. They don&#39;t stop to think that possibly the children were taking a <br/>\nbreak from designing a solar car, creating a replica of the Mona Lisa or <br/>\nbuilding a teepee in the back yard. Maybe Mom is not feeling so hot or maybe <br/>\nthe kids like to play video games and the wise mother, feeling that Nintendo <br/>\nwill help her son&#39;s poor hand eye coordination, lets them play on! Then the <br/>\nperson who finds them playing the video games, who probably was against <br/>\nunschooling in the first place, tars all unschoolers with the same brush and <br/>\nmakes a blanket statement, “All unschoolers do is allow their children to <br/>\nplay video games and watch TV all day. That is, after all what children will <br/>\ndo if not pushed.”<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Unschooling Fallacies: <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled children are completely responsible for their own education and <br/>\nparents never help their children learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis one not only makes me laugh, but really dishonors all those unschoolers <br/>\nwho run their children to classes, find mentors for them, help them when <br/>\ntheir children ask for it, spend hours at the library, carefully choose books <br/>\nfor reading aloud, take countless field trips, and play tons of games with <br/>\ntheir children. Unschooling parents are very involved with their children&#39;s <br/>\neducation...... they just don&#39;t run it.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling parents are too lazy to take the time to sit down and teach their <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee above answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling families have no discipline in their homes. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome do have discipline in their homes and some don&#39;t. Just like any other <br/>\nfamily. I think this misconception stems from the fact that many people think <br/>\nif a child has choices in their education that they get to do whatever they <br/>\nwant whenever they want to and they will always make bad choices. Child <br/>\nrearing techniques are as varied in unschoolers as they are in any other <br/>\ngroup of people.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers never use text books.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is another totally false assumption. Unschooling children and teens use <br/>\ntext books quite a bit, it&#39;s the parents who don&#39;t use text books. The <br/>\ndifference being, of course, that parents do not use them to teach.....the <br/>\nchildren use them to learn. Major difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might be able to unschool young children successfully but you can&#39;t <br/>\nunschool teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeens are at the very best age to unschool. The possibilities for teenagers <br/>\nin regard to volunteer opportunities, internships and focused learning is <br/>\nendless. Younger children often have difficulties getting adults to take them <br/>\nseriously in giving them jobs or volunteer positions. Teens generally don&#39;t <br/>\nhave that problem. The world opens up for them and this is a time when they <br/>\ncan really concentrate on their interests, taking advantage of the freedom <br/>\nmost adults don&#39;t have.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers are hippies, eat granola and sprouts, and wear sandals.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike any other people group unschoolers are diverse in both our dress and <br/>\neating habits. We are also diverse in where we live, our jobs, and our <br/>\nvarious faiths. <br/>\n<br/>\nThough I find these fallacies to be laughable, I also find them rather <br/>\nfrightening. Whenever you lump a group of people together and make <br/>\ngeneralizations about them you are practicing bigotry. From bigotry you will <br/>\nget discrimination. Unfortunately, much of the discrimination that <br/>\nunschoolers receive is from within the homeschool movement itself and <br/>\nespoused by some homeschool leaders. I care not whether these leaders agree <br/>\nwith how my children are educated, I care very much that I retain the right <br/>\nto educate them as I feel best. Only by bursting these fallacies will people <br/>\nbegin to understand what unschoolers are trying to achieve. <br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24620,"nextTopicId":24665}}
