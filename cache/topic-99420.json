I&#39;m looking for new points of view.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe main thing I see with bedtime issues have to do with control. When a bedtime is <br/>\narbitrary, the message is that parents will decide what is right for me and my input is <br/>\nunwelcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our house, we used to have bedtimes. Then we tried what was suggested on this list. We <br/>\ndidn&#39;t remove them (as in, &quot;you can now stay up as late as you want.&quot;). we simply stopped <br/>\n&quot;enforcing&quot; a bedtime. When my kids look tired, I will say, &quot;Looks like you&#39;re tired. Let&#39;s get <br/>\nto bed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey stay up later now (usually they are up until 9:30 or 10:00 - my 8, 10 and 13 yr olds). <br/>\nthe teens stay up to whatever hour they choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for the younger ones, we usually do point out that it&#39;s getting late or that they look <br/>\ntired or that now is a good time for us to help them get ready, if they are wanting help. We <br/>\noften simply help them get ready and then they stay up reading or playing quietly in their <br/>\nrooms.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of them has a reason to stay up late (really into an X box game, or a movie), we <br/>\nusually are fine with it. If there is a reason not to stay up late (we have a long drive the <br/>\nnext day, have to rise early to watch a meteor shower, are going to an amusement park all <br/>\nday the next day), we will record on DVR the show they&#39;re watching and will remind them <br/>\nof the next day&#39;s activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see us as having a gentle bedtime, rather than no bedtime. We are courteous and we are <br/>\nobservant. We help them get ready and we support them in going to bed when they are <br/>\nhappy and ready to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it&#39;s working because now the kids will often come to me and say, &quot;I&#39;m really tired. I <br/>\nwant to go to bed now&quot; and it might only be 8:30. That never happened with bedtimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Right now, the children usually go to bed somewhere between nine and ten o&#39;clock.

The only difference I see is that I cop to those <br/>\nreasons. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kids, we want some alone time. If you want us to help you get ready for bed, we&#39;re <br/>\navailable  now.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nor<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You&#39;re looking pretty exhausted. Want me to record your movie and help you get ready <br/>\nfor bed?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nor<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m feeling so tired myself. It makes me feel funny to think of you staying up later than <br/>\nme. Do you mind playing in your room a bit while I go to bed? Or willyou mind putting <br/>\nyourself to bed if I&#39;m already in bed?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all a matter of talking openly.

I lived with my mother for a year when I<br/>\nfirst came to the US (I was 31), and that was tough enough without a child<br/>\nin the picture.

She will stand to watch television so that she doesn�t fall asleep sitting, and will eat incessantly when tired.  I have offered to tape the shows she likes so she can watch them when she�s more awake too.  I just don�t know what to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\n ***Crockpot from the morning? Take something out of the freezer you made twice as much of another day?***<br/>\n<br/>\n I do this� still takes time to reheat and clean up afterwards.  Perhaps I am just feeling overwhelmed and whiny.  And sometimes I do need to be told.  Sometimes I get overwhelmed and don�t have the ability to see the choices.  I am newer to this than others, and I do need help and insight.  I wouldn�t be here asking if I didn�t know that somewhere I am missing/needing something.<br/>\n<br/>\n ***Who told you you&#39;ll get maggots if you don&#39;t clean the plates and take out the garbage?***<br/>\n<br/>\n No one told me.  It is personal experience.  We have flies and fruit flies.  We don�t have air conditioning and leave the windows and doors open to get the cross breeze.<br/>\n<br/>\n ***flies have to lay eggs, and it takes a while for them to develop into maggots.  More than a week, I think.***<br/>\n<br/>\n It takes 8-20 hours.  Again� personal experience.  Recent example:  DD left a cup of half-eaten soup in the living room.  She had eaten it for lunch on Tuesday.  Weds evening I went in search of the strange smell.  The cup had writhing maggots inside and crawling up the edges.  Sure, I can swat flies � but it only takes one fly seconds to lay a batch of eggs.  Also � not being home all day doesn�t make it 100% possible for me to swat them all.<br/>\n<br/>\n ***And maggots only grow on rotting meat and such, not on plastic bags and paper.***  <br/>\n<br/>\n Our garbage isn�t just paper and plastic.  It�s bones, foodstuff, etc�  I wanted to compost the vegetable matter, but where I live I can�t because of the city�s restrictions on location of compost piles/heaps.  I will just make a more concerted effort to grab it before I leave in the AM.  <br/>\n<br/>\n I haven�t moved completely into joyfully doing for everyone yet.  Sometimes I feel unappreciated and overwhelmed - not directly by my daughter as much as by my mother.  It does affect my daughter though, and part of why I am moving.  I ask for help, and I get �I want to do this�� or �I don�t want to�� or �I�m busy��  I try to accept that, but it�s hard.  There are things I would like to do too.  I even get those responses to the request of �let�s talk while I do XYZ�.  <br/>\n<br/>\n I know some of it is a by-product living with my mother, and that definitely affects a lot of my attitude etc.  I have begun the process of letting go of the idea that �I HAVE to do XYZ right now�� when I REALLY don�t, etc�  There are still things to be done, and even if I don�t have to do it immediately � I do have to do most of it eventually.  Do you know what I mean?  I don�t mean to say that DD�s wants or needs are less important than mine, but I DO have needs and wants too.  How does DD get her needs met adequately and I get mine?  I am simply not home enough to do all the better things I want to do � which is terribly frustrating to me.  I don�t know how to gain that equilibrium and experience that would facilitate a better unschooling and mindful-parenting environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n ***But if the mom&#39;s comfort level is the deciding factor, that&#39;s worth noting and admitting.***<br/>\n<br/>\n Okay� If you are talking relationships though, is there room for some kind of equilibrium between child�s comfort and parent�s comfort?  How does one facilitate this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nY! Messenger - Communicate in real time.
