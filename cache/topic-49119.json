Here is what I said. <br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed you put <br/>\nquotation marks around the word rare, as if to imply that partial birth isn&#39;t <br/>\n<br/>\nreally rare at all. It really is. It is rarely used in women who couldn&#39;t get <br/>\n<br/>\nan abortion in the first trimester, about 1%.

And here we are left with a red guy<br/>\nwith horns and a forked tale that tempts people to do<br/>\nbad. I don&#39;t find I need any help in being tempted to<br/>\nbe &quot;bad&quot;. My own human make-up is enough to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think using a &quot;Satan made me do it&quot; is a co-opt for<br/>\naccepting the logical consquences of our own behavior.<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have to examine ourselves and see if we are<br/>\nliving up tp our true potential (as human beings) we<br/>\ncan blame it on Satan and in order to scare my<br/>\nchildren from doing &quot;bad&quot; I can threaten them with<br/>\nhell and tell them to &quot;watch out for Satan&quot;. If people<br/>\ncould just see that within all of us - there is the<br/>\nability to do both good and evil - <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Hell is in the Bible - but if anyone ever bothered<br/>\nto examine the linguistics of the words it is clear<br/>\nthat the original words have taken on meanings of<br/>\ntheir own from culture and people trying to make sense<br/>\nof life and spirituality.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a believer in Christ. I read the Bible every day<br/>\n- I know we all have differences of opinion on what<br/>\nthe Bible says - and some of us aren&#39;t beleivers in<br/>\nthe Bible. I am finding it hard to listen to the other<br/>\nChristian voices on this list -  each of us has<br/>\nhis/her own &quot;truth&quot; - so to debate this all is not<br/>\nfruitful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on the Creation issue - When the Bible says the<br/>\n&quot;world was without form and void&quot; who knows how long<br/>\nit was like that. Geologists may very well be right.<br/>\nLook at all the planets sitting there now - if God so<br/>\nchose to create another &quot;earth&quot; out of one of them he<br/>\ncertainly could have done it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd who knows that God hadn&#39;t created a &quot;race&quot; before.<br/>\nWhere did the angels come from? They were there at the<br/>\nbeginning of creation. &quot;Let us make man in OUR image&quot;<br/>\nIt says God created the earth. the Hebrew word for God<br/>\nis &#39;Elohim&quot; meaning mighty ones - plural. So some<br/>\nplurality created the earth. AND I know some feel this<br/>\nwas Christ and God. But I think Mighty Ones is what it<br/>\nsays - and I think they were the angels. And then you<br/>\ncan only speculate where they came from. This is a<br/>\nwhole different topic. <br/>\n<br/>\nOk - so my ideas may seem radical from the mainstream<br/>\nChristianity - but I wanted to make it clear that<br/>\nthere is not even one Christian view - from those of<br/>\nus that are believers in Christ. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I apologize to those that don&#39;t want to discuss<br/>\nreligion.

But<br/>\ncreationists are seeing the data filtered through their belief in the young<br/>\nearth and seeing it fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nScientists (and some of them are Christian, though probably not Bible<br/>\nliteralists) see data and look for patterns. They build theories to explain<br/>\nthe patterns they see.<br/>\n<br/>\nCreationists *say* that scientists are fiercely fighting to protect<br/>\nevolutonary and old earth theories. But if scientists are protecting<br/>\nevolutionary and old earth theories over better evidence, why are they? What<br/>\nadvantage do those theories give them? And how is this conspiracy being<br/>\nmanaged? It&#39;s not just &quot;evolutionary&quot; scientists holding their data in<br/>\nsecret, spitting out a theory they want everyone to believe to protect their<br/>\njobs. Evolution and old earth cut across many disciplines.  What do<br/>\nastronomers and geologists care whether man evolved from apes or not? It<br/>\nreally makes no difference to astronomers whether the universe is 4000 or 15<br/>\nbillion years old. The theories cut across many religions, many countries,<br/>\nmany political boundaries. If there&#39;s some conspiracy to protect the<br/>\ntheories, it&#39;s got incredible cooperation among a huge number of scientists<br/>\nthat have no reason to support each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut creationists, on the other hand, have a huge stake in proving<br/>\ncreationism: the foundation of their religion. Everything a creationist does<br/>\nis filtered through the absolute certainty that his theory is right. If a<br/>\ncreationist turns up something that points to the Bible as being in error,<br/>\nhe&#39;s certain the data is wrong because the Bible can&#39;t be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no such pressure for scientists involved in biology, astronomy,<br/>\ngeology, nuclear physics. If one theory falls all it means is another theory<br/>\nthat will help them understand the universe a little better has come along.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Young earth vs. old earth","postDate":"1036524687","msgId":49167,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYuMTg5Yzc4NC4yYWY5NzY4ZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49166,"nextInTopic":49168,"prevInTime":49166,"nextInTime":49168,"topicId":49119,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/5/02 6:04:13 AM Central Standard Time, ...

I wonder whether it&#39;s <br/>\nharder to be a young earth proponent in a place like Utah or <br/>\nColorado, with BIG mountains.&quot;  It&#39;s a good point, and I think your <br/>\nexplanation of tectonic plates covers it:<br/>\n <br/>\n &lt;&lt; The quest for evolutionary evidence is fine as science, but wrong <br/>\nas a disproof(?) of a religion &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Except &quot;Evolutionary scientists&quot; are not TRYING to disprove <br/>\n&gt;religion, it&#39;s not even a part of the picture.  But &quot;Creation-<br/>\n&gt;scientists&quot; ARE trying to disprove evolution. In order to &quot;prove&quot; <br/>\n&gt;religion.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour latter statement is correct.  See site #2 at the bottom of this <br/>\npost for a brief definition of creation scientists (not all literally <br/>\nBible-based).  On the former, I have seen statements in the past by <br/>\nevolutionists who refuse to face the alternative if evolution is <br/>\nwrong; if you are interested, I will look for them.<br/>\n <br/>\n &lt;&lt; Some of these sites will probably back up your current beliefs, <br/>\n&lt;&lt;and others will challenge or expand them. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; How about some sites by non-christians who did not set out to prove <br/>\n&gt;that the bible is true?<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I had done this, but this is a good question.  Of the four <br/>\ncategories of sites I found, the old earth category sites were all by <br/>\nnon-Christians who were not trying to prove or disprove the Bible, as <br/>\nfar I could tell.  The other three (young earth, gap, and comparison) <br/>\nwere coming from some form of belief in God and the Bible.  So <br/>\nalthough I did include the sites you asked about in one category, are <br/>\nyou asking if I can find sites in the other three categories that are <br/>\nnot trying to prove the Bible, but came to these theories in other <br/>\nways?  If so, let me know and I will take a look.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn summary, the purpose of my post is to show that thinking people <br/>\ncan believe in creation or in a young earth, and there are scientists <br/>\nwho support these theories (and have throughout history).<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n                     ---------------<br/>\nSites showing credentialed scientists who believe in creation follow, <br/>\nalong with excerpts from the text of each site:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.christiananswers.net/creation/people/home.html\">http://www.christiananswers.net/creation/people/home.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDo real scientists believe in Creation? Answer...<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is it possible for reasonable, intelligent, well-educated people <br/>\nto hold such diametrically opposite views as Evolutionism and <br/>\nCreationism? Answer...<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://emporium.turnpike.net/C/cs/creatdef.htm\">http://emporium.turnpike.net/C/cs/creatdef.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nA major goal of creation science is to point out the weakness of <br/>\nevolutionary theory, because basically there are only two <br/>\nalternatives for how we got here, and if naturalistic processes are <br/>\nincapable of the task, then special creation must be the correct <br/>\nanswer. On the positive side, creation scientists are developing <br/>\nalternative models and theories in many areas to help our <br/>\nunderstanding of how the universe works. It should be noted that much <br/>\nof day to day scientific activity is not heavily influenced by either <br/>\nevolutionary or creation assumptions, but much scientific energy has <br/>\nbeen wasted over the last century in the search for evolutionary <br/>\nevidences and experimental proofs, which have been unsuccessful so <br/>\nfar and will continue to be. How much further might we be in some <br/>\nareas of scientific understanding if a model of special creation had <br/>\nbeen the working hypothesis? <br/>\n<br/>\n3.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-scientists.html\">http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-scientists.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDespite strong pressure to accept evolutionism, many intelligent and <br/>\nexperienced scientists either openly or secretly dismiss Evolution as <br/>\nhighly unlikely or impossible. In the 1980s, researcher and lecturer <br/>\nDavid Watson noted an increasing trend that continues today, <br/>\ndisturbing those who want evolutionism to be perceived as the <br/>\naccepted scientific consensus...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Science Digest reported:&quot;Scientists who utterly reject Evolution <br/>\nmay be one of our fastest-growing controversial minorities... Many of <br/>\nthe scientists supporting this position hold impressive credentials <br/>\nin science.&quot; 3 <br/>\n<br/>\nOne example is the late Dr. Arthur E. Wilder-Smith, an honored <br/>\nscientist with an amazing three earned doctorates. He held many <br/>\ndistinguished positions. 4 A former Evolutionist, Dr. Wilder-Smith <br/>\ndebated various leading scientists on the subject throughout the <br/>\nworld. In his opinion, the Evolution model did not fit as well with <br/>\nthe established facts of science as did the Creation model of <br/>\nintelligent design. <br/>\n<br/>\n4.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.icr.org/creationscientists.html\">http://www.icr.org/creationscientists.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.icr.org/faqs/sgp15.html\">http://www.icr.org/faqs/sgp15.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRead lists of real scientists in many different fields who believe in <br/>\na literal creation. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday there are thousands of scientists who are creationists and who <br/>\nrepudiate any form of molecules-to-man evolution in their analysis <br/>\nand use of scientific data. Creation scientists can now be found in <br/>\nliterally every discipline of science, and their numbers are <br/>\nincreasing rapidly. Evolutionists are finding it increasingly <br/>\ndifficult to maintain the fiction that evolution is &quot;science&quot; and <br/>\ncreation science is &quot;religion&quot;. When news media personnel and others <br/>\nmake such statements today, they merely reveal their own liberal <br/>\nsocial philosophies-not their awareness of scientific facts.<br/>\n<br/>\n...this is a small sampling of real scientists from around the world <br/>\nwho believe in a literal creation. Nobody has ever taken a <br/>\ncomprehensive survey of the world&#39;s universities, research <br/>\norganizations, etc. to find out who is an evolutionist or <br/>\ncreationist. Whether evolutionist or creationist, most scientists do <br/>\nnot get involved in the creation versus evolution controversy. Also, <br/>\nmany creationists keep their beliefs secret depending on the <br/>\nsituation for fear of discrimination, etc. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":110891718,"authorName":"Nicole Nichol","from":"Nicole Nichol &lt;mom23princess@...&gt;","profile":"mom23princess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Young earth vs. old earth","postDate":"1036506265","msgId":49162,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMTA1MTQyNDI1Ljk3ODkwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0ODAxLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGFxOGMxaSs5ODZkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49161,"nextInTopic":49163,"prevInTime":49161,"nextInTime":49163,"topicId":49119,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you want to learn more about the earth & other scientific facts,please visit www.islam-guide.com  All this information was given to us before any scientist","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1574759717\">If you want to learn more about the earth & other scientific facts,please visit www.islam-guide.com  All this information was given to us before any scientist made any of the discoveries themselves.Pretty interesting info.This is not by any means a coversion tactic but since we are on the topic of earth,I thought I&#39;d share this info.<br/>\nRenee<br/>\n Mike Ebbers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikeebb@...\">mikeebb@...</a>&gt; wrote:I apologize for this long post.

And when people actually dig into the facts, they are <br/>\nsometimes surprised.  This is not only true for fundamentalist <br/>\nChristians, but for most people of any religion or political <br/>\npersuasion.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, when one senatorial candidate (in 2000) came out for <br/>\nabortion but against so-called partial birth abortion, three women <br/>\n(ages 45, 70, and 82) asked my wife what partial birth abortion was.  <br/>\nWhen she told them, they were shocked, and then they understood why <br/>\nthe candidate was against it.  Before that, as sheep they might have <br/>\nbeen reading the media reports and thinking that only closed-minded <br/>\npersons would be against this &quot;rare&quot; procedure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the young earth old earth debate and creation science, <br/>\nthere are many resources on that, and they all sound convincing in <br/>\ntheir own way.  No one really knows, since we cannot yet reproduce <br/>\nthe formation of the universe or the earth.  So it&#39;s all in whom we <br/>\nchoose to believe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy purpose in this post is not to convince anyone of anything (I <br/>\nwould love to but I know I can&#39;t).  I just want to state that there <br/>\nis enough evidence available in favor of a young earth and for <br/>\ncreation science (intelligent design, or whatever you&#39;d like to call <br/>\nthat type of study) so that you don&#39;t have to classify people who <br/>\nbelieve it as liars, bullies, or unthinking sheep.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, even on the highest mountaintops are found evidence of <br/>\nshellfish (such as oysters). So presumably at some point those <br/>\nmountains were covered by water.  Some scientists believe that at one <br/>\ntime those mountains were much lower.  Then they were covered by a <br/>\nglobal flood, then pushed up to their current height.  There may be <br/>\nother explanations, but that one certainly can be believed without <br/>\nbeing classified as an unthinking sheep.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me (and I gather for the scientist Aimee Yermish -- but see her <br/>\narticle at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-</a><br/>\ndotcom/message/46449 , because for obvious reasons she doesn&#39;t like <br/>\nto be quoted out of context), the more important point is that we see <br/>\nthe creator as we look around us.  It doesn&#39;t matter whether it took <br/>\n4.5 billion years or 4,000 years to create the earth, but we can <br/>\nenjoy the results either way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome evolutionists have falsified evidence for their theory, and some <br/>\nevolutionists insist on evolution as the only scientific way because <br/>\nthey do not want to believe in a creator.  The quest for evolutionary <br/>\nevidence is fine as science, but wrong as a disproof(?) of a religion.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those on this list who would like to prepare themselves for <br/>\nquestions by their kids, or who wonder about this young-old earth <br/>\ndebate themselves, I did a little googling and came up with four <br/>\ncategories of sites, in support of various views:  comparison of <br/>\nyoung-old earth in a fairly even-handed fashion, young earth, old <br/>\nearth, and old universe-young earth.

So it&#39;s all in whom we <br/>\nchoose to believe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy purpose in this post is not to convince anyone of anything (I <br/>\nwould love to but I know I can&#39;t).  I just want to state that there <br/>\nis enough evidence available in favor of a young earth and for <br/>\ncreation science (intelligent design, or whatever you&#39;d like to call <br/>\nthat type of study) so that you don&#39;t have to classify people who <br/>\nbelieve it as liars, bullies, or unthinking sheep.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, even on the highest mountaintops are found evidence of <br/>\nshellfish (such as oysters). So presumably at some point those <br/>\nmountains were covered by water.  Some scientists believe that at one <br/>\ntime those mountains were much lower.  Then they were covered by a <br/>\nglobal flood, then pushed up to their current height.  There may be <br/>\nother explanations, but that one certainly can be believed without <br/>\nbeing classified as an unthinking sheep.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me (and I gather for the scientist Aimee Yermish -- but see her <br/>\narticle at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-</a><br/>\ndotcom/message/46449 , because for obvious reasons she doesn&#39;t like <br/>\nto be quoted out of context), the more important point is that we see <br/>\nthe creator as we look around us.  It doesn&#39;t matter whether it took <br/>\n4.5 billion years or 4,000 years to create the earth, but we can <br/>\nenjoy the results either way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome evolutionists have falsified evidence for their theory, and some <br/>\nevolutionists insist on evolution as the only scientific way because <br/>\nthey do not want to believe in a creator.  The quest for evolutionary <br/>\nevidence is fine as science, but wrong as a disproof(?) of a religion.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those on this list who would like to prepare themselves for <br/>\nquestions by their kids, or who wonder about this young-old earth <br/>\ndebate themselves, I did a little googling and came up with four <br/>\ncategories of sites, in support of various views:  comparison of <br/>\nyoung-old earth in a fairly even-handed fashion, young earth, old <br/>\nearth, and old universe-young earth.  Some of these sites will <br/>\nprobably back up your current beliefs, and others will challenge or <br/>\nexpand them.  If you have time, have a glance at the comparisons.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n                   -----------<br/>\n<br/>\nCOMPARISON OF OLD vs. YOUNG EARTH<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sonlight.com/articles/young_or_old_earth.html\">http://www.sonlight.com/articles/young_or_old_earth.html</a><br/>\nA site that seeks to put the young-old earth debate into perspective <br/>\nwithout supporting either side.

When people say homeschoolers <br/>\nshould stick together, what they must mean is that the right-wing Christians <br/>\ncannot themselves defend their methods, so they want ALL homeschoolers to <br/>\nwork together to defend their right to keep their children isolated with <br/>\nfalse history and made-up science.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does quite seem that many Christians have lied to create &quot;creation <br/>\nscience,&quot; and now they want to cajole, bully and shame all the homeschoolers <br/>\nin the world to work to cover for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-<br/>\nThe creationist movement also does not like to talk about the scientists who <br/>\nleave after being given the opportunity to do real field research. In 1957, <br/>\nthe Geoscience Research Institute was formed in order to search for evidence <br/>\nof Noah&#39;s Flood in the geological record. The project fell apart when both of <br/>\nthe creationists involved with the project, P. Edgar Hare and Richard <br/>\nRitland, completed their field research with the conclusion that fossils were <br/>\nmuch older than allowed under the creationist assertions, and that no <br/>\ngeological or paleontological evidence of any sort could be found to indicate <br/>\nthe occurrence of a world-wide flood. (Numbers, 1992, pp 291-293) Hare <br/>\nconcluded, &quot;We have been taught for years that almost everything in the <br/>\ngeological record is the result of the Flood. I&#39;ve seen enough in the field <br/>\nto realize that quite substantial portions of the geologic record are not the <br/>\ndirect result of the Flood. We have also been led to believe . . . that the <br/>\nevidence for the extreme age of the earth is extremely tenuous and really not <br/>\nworthy of any credence at all. I have tried to make a rather careful study of <br/>\nthis evidence over the past several years, and I feel that the evidence is <br/>\nnot ambiguous but that it is just as clear as the evidence that the earth is <br/>\nround.&quot; (cited in Numbers, 1992, p. 294) Ritland, for his part, pointed out <br/>\nthat Morris&#39;s book The Genesis Flood contained &quot;flagrant errors which the <br/>\nuninitiated person is scarcely able to detect&quot;. (cited in Numbers, 1992, p. <br/>\n294) Ritland concluded that further attempts to justify Flood geology would <br/>\n&quot;only bring embarrassment and discredit to the cause of God&quot;.
