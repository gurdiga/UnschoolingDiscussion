IMO, nine times out of ten, you don&#39;t have to <br/>\nhave money to fight ignorance. <br/>\nA principal of a local school tried to tell a friend of mine that she <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t homeschool. She even threatened my friend with truancy charges. <br/>\n(Sent by registered mail, with the date she was expected to show in family <br/>\ncourt to answer the charges against her.) Now my friend had registered her <br/>\nhomeschool with the KDOE, and she had notified the principal of the school <br/>\nthat her son would not be returning. She still had to go through this, <br/>\nalmost. I went with her to a meeting with the principal, armed with a copy of <br/>\nthe statute about private schools. (Kansas doesn&#39;t recognize homeschooling, <br/>\nwe fall under the private school statute.) I asked the principal to show us, <br/>\nin writing, where the law says we can&#39;t homeschool. She couldn&#39;t do it, she <br/>\napologized for being wrong, and that was it. <br/>\nNine times out of ten, things like this are because of uninformed or <br/>\nmisinformed people. Nine times out of ten, four words do the trick. &quot;Show me <br/>\nin writing.&quot; (Then again, there is that tenth time. &lt;g&gt;) <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: 2225 -- what price for freedom?","postDate":"1029092436","msgId":40719,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5N0MyQzk0LkI3MjUlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGFqNmF2MCtta2lrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40717,"nextInTopic":40743,"prevInTime":40718,"nextInTime":40720,"topicId":40654,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
