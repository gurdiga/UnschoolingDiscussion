He heard <br/>\nvoices in a way I never had.  H heard voices like artists see colors.  He <br/>\nwould recognize a voice on a commercial and say &quot;that&#39;s they guy who does <br/>\nMichaelangelo on Ninja Turtles,&quot; and on Sesame Street he figured out which <br/>\nall were Jim Henson and which all were Frank Oz.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we were in a little-kids&#39; homeschooling chat.  I was typing for him; he <br/>\nwas dictating.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the kids wrote &quot;Who&#39;s your favorite singer?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the time he told me to write &quot;Michael Jackson...&quot;<br/>\nand I did, and he added &quot;Julie Andrews,&quot;<br/>\neight or ten other kids had put &quot;Amy Grant.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nNobody else named anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a creepy moment in which I felt proud of Kirby and afraid of all other <br/>\nhomeschoolers on earth.  That&#39;s a weird thing, but it was true at that <br/>\nmoment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had tried to expose Kirby to anything and everything.  When he was asked <br/>\nwhat singer he liked, he scanned his mind for every singer in every style he <br/>\nhad ever heard and picked the two he honestly felt were the best singers.  He <br/>\nwas using the knowledge he had in a guileless and open and honest way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I could think was the others were naming one of the few singers their <br/>\nparents would let them listen to, and that when she was no longer the #1 <br/>\nsinger in her (very small) field, they would move on to some other temporary <br/>\nfavorite.  They weren&#39;t listening to singers in anywhere NEAR the way Kirby <br/>\nwas listening, nor in the range of exposure to music Kirby was getting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes a moment like that strengthens all resolve and belief in <br/>\nunschooling and trusting kids to grow IF you encourage and let them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI repotted some plants I had kinda forgotten about lately.  They were dusty <br/>\nand root-bound and Holly helped me re-pot.  Of course every one of them <br/>\ngreened up, stretched out, and showed new growth.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people keep their kids in a small pot.  Too small and too long.<br/>\nI have NO idea how those plants grow, what their roots are thinking, how they <br/>\nprocess what&#39;s in the soil, but I had been starving them in dust.  My job was <br/>\njust to make sure they had good, fresh soil and water and sun.  THEY know <br/>\nwhat they&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel the same way about my kids.  If they want more music, I get more <br/>\nmusic.  More outings?  Let&#39;s go.  More art supplies?  Okay.  Games?  Yes.   <br/>\nSuper glue and stuff I don&#39;t even recognize?  Parts to fix a TV I&#39;d just as <br/>\nsoon throw out?  For them it&#39;s good, rich material.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27460,"nextTopicId":27541}}
