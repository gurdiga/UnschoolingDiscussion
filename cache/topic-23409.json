My mother thought my sister and I potty<br/>\ntrained early because we were naked most of the time. <br/>\nI think mine potty trained early because they weren&#39;t.<br/>\n Almost from the day they were born I noticed they<br/>\nwould pee or poop almost as soon as I took their<br/>\ndiapers off (often before I had a chance to put the<br/>\nnew diaper under them.) Just since this discussion<br/>\nhave I realized that that is probably why they always<br/>\nwent on the potty when I put them on.  They were going<br/>\nto go where ever because I took their diaper off and<br/>\nthey potty became a habit. But they probably would<br/>\nhave potty trained early no matter what I did because<br/>\nit is sort of pre-programed that way for them. My<br/>\nsister and I and our children all potty trained at<br/>\n18-22 months - but my brother, who is adopted, didn&#39;t<br/>\npotty train until he was about 3-3.5 and neither did<br/>\nhis children, which is what makes me wonder about some<br/>\nsort of genetic connection.<br/>\nMichele<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
