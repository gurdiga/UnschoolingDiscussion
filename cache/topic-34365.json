I think that if you<br/>\nbrought up your thoughts and opinions and the reasons for them and asked<br/>\nhow that would conflict or coincide with unschooling thought, and what<br/>\nare the reasons others would do it differently, you could probably start<br/>\nan interesting discussion and gain a lot of information regarding<br/>\nunschooling.  I think that when people respond to a person&#39;s statement<br/>\nabruptly and emphatically like they are the ultimate authority, it can<br/>\nmake a person wince.  Keep in mind that things often sound like they are<br/>\nlaw when they are really just a person&#39;s effort to state what they<br/>\nbelieve.  Sometimes, too, it seems like everyone is attacking because<br/>\nthere are so many reactions to one person&#39;s words or because it has<br/>\nfollowed a thread and become something other than a response to the first<br/>\nsubject, but the person who started the subject thinks everyone is<br/>\ntalking about them instead of about theories and thoughts with no one&#39;s<br/>\nname attached.  (am I confusing you, this run-on sentence is starting to<br/>\nconfuse me:))  <br/>\nMy experience so far with unschooling has been that when I hit bumps in<br/>\nthe road, I research until I find why it isn&#39;t working.
