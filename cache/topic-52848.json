In the 10th grade I <br/>\nthink it was we read Tennyson&#39;s Idylls of the King.  It was dry stuff with <br/>\nlanguage that shot straight over my head.  But, I had a GREAT teacher.  She <br/>\nwas really animated and fun and pointed stuff out and explored some of the <br/>\ndenser language with us.  The result was that I actually enjoyed that <br/>\nclass.  In fact, I never even cut that class (just all the others).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m grateful to that teacher for showing me the possibilities where <br/>\nliterature is concerned.  It&#39;s interesting:  Liam (8yo son) loves to read <br/>\nat night but definitely lobbies to have me do the reading rather than his <br/>\ndad.  I think it&#39;s because I try to dramatize the reading (change my voice <br/>\nfor the different characters, etc.), and dh just plain reads.  I have Mrs. <br/>\nCostello to thank for that.  I remember the day she introduced <br/>\n&quot;unscrupulous&quot; as a vocabulary word.  She always presented vocabulary words <br/>\nin some funny way; she mimed or acted out the different parts of the word <br/>\nso we would remember it.  The -pu- part was the funniest of all.  In <br/>\nretrospect, I think she probably could see how goofy working on vocabulary <br/>\nwords really was.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, enough of that!

Got me really <br/>\n&gt; depressed.     Thought I missed something when I read it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s several such liberties in the Two Towers, even more so than <br/>\nin the Fellowship. I didn&#39;t mind so much the stuff they changed in <br/>\nthe Fellowship, leaving out Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Wights, which <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have much impact on the story in the first place, and adding <br/>\nthe great horse chase scene with Arwyn (it was nice to have at least <br/>\none woman doing some action in the movie as there isn&#39;t much in the <br/>\nbook). <br/>\nBut the 2nd movie seemed to change a lot more things, and for less <br/>\nclear reasons. I was really surprised to see them leave the whole <br/>\nEnt/Huron part out of the Helm&#39;s Deep scene, and I have no idea why <br/>\nthey would do that. Also can&#39;t imagine why they cast Eowyn as such a <br/>\nwaif. Have to wait until the Director&#39;s cut DVD with voice-over to <br/>\nsee why, I guess. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; These books are amazing,   <br/>\n&gt; I had never read them through and am <br/>\n&gt; doing so right now.   Tolkien was incredible!  <br/>\n&gt; The history and the details he had to have <br/>\n&gt; come up with,   the 4 CD pack we got is awesome too,  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you like the 4 CD set, I&#39;d also recommend finding the National <br/>\nGeographic &quot;Behind the Movie&quot; special as well. It&#39;s not so much about <br/>\nthe making of the movie, but more about Tolkien&#39;s childhood and young <br/>\nadulthood and the things that shaped his vision of the story. It has <br/>\na fascinating part about his interest in the Tolovana, a largely <br/>\nspoken/song history of a people from the far north of Finland (I <br/>\nthink, if my memory serves). Also a fair bit about his participation <br/>\nin WW1 and how that influenced him (some of the earliest bits of the <br/>\nHobbit/LOTR world were written by him in the trenches). Netflix has <br/>\nthis DVD, and some local movie rental places do as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t read this when I was <br/>\n&gt; younger,  Alec, 9yr son, has attempted reading <br/>\n&gt; it but its a bit above him.   He reads more and <br/>\n&gt; more tho&#39; as he watches more and more.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I remember reading the trilogy starting at age 11, I think I had read <br/>\nthe Hobbit a year earlier. That was a perfect time to read it, as age <br/>\n11/12 you still have that magical belief, but you&#39;re poised on the <br/>\nedge of teenage passionate involvement with things. I remember my two <br/>\nbest friends and I would ride our horses far into the woods and <br/>\npretend to be three elven queens. We would gallop through the forests <br/>\nwith the dark forces in imaginary chase behind us. Maybe that&#39;s why I <br/>\nlove that chase scene with Arwyn so much, come to think of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re reading LOTR right now (I&#39;m reading out loud to the kids), and <br/>\nenjoying it all over again. And I agree, that 4-disk set is great! <br/>\nThe kids have been fascinated with all the detail on how such a <br/>\nmonumental piece of fantasy was created on screen.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I didn&#39;t mind so much the stuff they changed in <br/>\nthe Fellowship, leaving out Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Wights, which <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have much impact on the story in the first place, and adding <br/>\nthe great horse chase scene with Arwyn (it was nice to have at least <br/>\none woman doing some action in the movie as there isn&#39;t much in the <br/>\nbook). <br/>\nBut the 2nd movie seemed to change a lot more things, and for less <br/>\nclear reasons. I was really surprised to see them leave the whole <br/>\nEnt/Huron part out of the Helm&#39;s Deep scene, and I have no idea why <br/>\nthey would do that. Also can&#39;t imagine why they cast Eowyn as such a <br/>\nwaif. Have to wait until the Director&#39;s cut DVD with voice-over to <br/>\nsee why, I guess. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; These books are amazing,   <br/>\n&gt; I had never read them through and am <br/>\n&gt; doing so right now.

It&#39;s not so much about <br/>\nthe making of the movie, but more about Tolkien&#39;s childhood and young <br/>\nadulthood and the things that shaped his vision of the story. It has <br/>\na fascinating part about his interest in the Tolovana, a largely <br/>\nspoken/song history of a people from the far north of Finland (I <br/>\nthink, if my memory serves). Also a fair bit about his participation <br/>\nin WW1 and how that influenced him (some of the earliest bits of the <br/>\nHobbit/LOTR world were written by him in the trenches). Netflix has <br/>\nthis DVD, and some local movie rental places do as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t read this when I was <br/>\n&gt; younger,  Alec, 9yr son, has attempted reading <br/>\n&gt; it but its a bit above him.

That was a perfect time to read it, as age <br/>\n11/12 you still have that magical belief, but you&#39;re poised on the <br/>\nedge of teenage passionate involvement with things. I remember my two <br/>\nbest friends and I would ride our horses far into the woods and <br/>\npretend to be three elven queens. We would gallop through the forests <br/>\nwith the dark forces in imaginary chase behind us. Maybe that&#39;s why I <br/>\nlove that chase scene with Arwyn so much, come to think of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re reading LOTR right now (I&#39;m reading out loud to the kids), and <br/>\nenjoying it all over again. And I agree, that 4-disk set is great! <br/>\nThe kids have been fascinated with all the detail on how such a <br/>\nmonumental piece of fantasy was created on screen.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Two Towers and reading Tolkien","postDate":"1041446621","msgId":52899,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJkLjJjYTQ0NDk4LjJiNDQ5MGRkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":52898,"nextInTopic":52903,"prevInTime":52898,"nextInTime":52900,"topicId":52848,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/1/03 10:40:49 AM, kellitraas@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1002488504\">In a message dated 1/1/03 10:40:49 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kellitraas@...\">kellitraas@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Also just found Ian McKlellan&#39;s web site and it has some great pics of <br/>\nthem when they were filming.

We make birthdays about the person and <br/>\nhow special they are and how blessed we are to have that person in our <br/>\nlives and Christmas is more family and a celebration of our faith as <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to sum up- lots of gifts or surprises on the birthday and fewer on <br/>\nChristmas.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that this helps,<br/>\nLeslie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt; &quot;What do you buy a kid that just had Christmas&quot;!  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Starting to drizzle...","postDate":"1041373763","msgId":52883,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxZWUwMWMyYjExZCQwMDMyZWFhMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGF1cjNydStxYjhxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52874,"nextInTopic":52889,"prevInTime":52882,"nextInTime":52884,"topicId":52848,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

All the grown out of toys <br/>\nand clothes that aren&#39;t worn go there. Nice little chunk of change for me <br/>\nwithout all the hassle.

I <br/>\nhave skills, I just cant find anyone to pay me for them.. :-)    Well, tax <br/>\nrefund time is just around the bend. maybe we will survive til Uncle Sam <br/>\nkicks us back a few $$..<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Starting to drizzle...","postDate":"1041287189","msgId":52849,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY3M2NTbFZ2aUZsdVp3MFZjbFgwMDAwMjMwYkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":52848,"nextInTopic":52851,"prevInTime":52848,"nextInTime":52850,"topicId":52848,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m here too.
