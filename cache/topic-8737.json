My 4 year old&#39;s reaction to things is a rash all around her<br/>\nmouth. She recieves no dairy or nuts (2 products that I know set her off)<br/>\nand she still breaks out quite often. Sometimes the reaction is so delayed I<br/>\ncan never pinpoint the food. I am begining to suspect tomato products too.<br/>\nShe also is allergic to Huggies pull ups (which she needs for bed). Talk<br/>\nabout diaper rash! Most other brands she does o.k. with. I had to take her<br/>\nout of cloth because she pees too much to hold it. My 2 yr. old has severe<br/>\nallergies to nuts and eggs, but luckily seems to have outgrown her wheat and<br/>\ndairy allergies. All 3 of my kids have asthma and very sensitive skin. It&#39;s<br/>\nso hard to go out because we have to travel with at least one epi pen, 2<br/>\ninhalers, and a nebulizer. Whew. Anyway you might want to check ou<br/>\nwww.fan.org for food allergy info. Sorry I rambled. Good Luck.<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jaam1224@...\">Jaam1224@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 29, 2000 10:12 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] alternatives<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Nicoletta, Brynn and all,<br/>\n&gt; I love all the information you all have been sending!!! :  )  Please, keep<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; coming: ) : )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am new at this veggie stuff and I am always interested in new ideas<br/>\n&gt; ecspecially where food is concerned.

Wonderful. Gives you omega3 oils on top of being<br/>\ncompletely nutritious.<br/>\n1/3 cup whole flax seeds<br/>\n1 cup water.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a blender or food processor, blend the seeds to an even meal. Then slowly<br/>\nadd water while blending. Blend until mixture resembles a thick milkshake.<br/>\nTransfer to a sealable container and store in the fridge (will keep for 3-6<br/>\ndays). If you like you can pour through a straner to remove the seeds. Makes<br/>\nthe equivalent of 6 eggs. Flax eggs are great for binders in pancakes,<br/>\nbreads, and other baking, but not to eat on their own. 3 Tablespoons of flax<br/>\neggs equals 1 egg.<br/>\n<br/>\nA note on the soy/rice cheeses. If you&#39;re looking for  vegan alternatives to<br/>\ncheese, there are very few that do not contain casein, a milk derived<br/>\nprotein. If you have little ones that are sensitive to dairy, casein can<br/>\ntrigger the same reactions. SOYMAGE is a vegan cheese, as well as<br/>\nVEGANRELLA. HOWEVER, when you&#39;re not eating cheese, you do not crave it.<br/>\nThese types of cheese are not meant to be consumed like dairy cheese. They<br/>\nare meant to be used very sparingly. I use them rarely. Maybe a tiny bit<br/>\nsprinkled VERY lightly on a veggie pizza every now and then, but I haven&#39;t<br/>\ndone that in a while. We just don&#39;t use them often.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrynn~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best night and day<br/>\nto make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human<br/>\nbeing can fight and never stop fighting.&quot;<br/>\n--e.e. cummings<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jaam1224@...\">Jaam1224@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jaam1224@...\">Jaam1224@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 29, 2000 10:12 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] alternatives<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNicoletta, Brynn and all,<br/>\nI love all the information you all have been sending!!! :  )  Please, keep<br/>\nit<br/>\ncoming: ) : )<br/>\n<br/>\nI am new at this veggie stuff and I am always interested in new ideas<br/>\necspecially where food is concerned.
