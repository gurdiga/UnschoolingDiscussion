I <br/>\nfigured out how to thread the thing. I could load a bobbin. I never made <br/>\nclothes with it, but I used it to make curtains and pillows, etc---household <br/>\nthings. For about 7 years. <br/>\n<br/>\nMine became crooked somewhere along the line (maybe all those military <br/>\nmoves?), and the needle hits the foot. And breaks off. AND HITS ME JUST LEFT <br/>\nOF MY RIGHT EYE!!! I freaked the first time, and bought a new needle. It did <br/>\nit again, (freakier!), so I bought another. After the third time, I put the <br/>\nSOB in the box and back in the closet. I haven&#39;t brought &quot;The Blinder&quot; out <br/>\nsince.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never got really good at it, but I was OK. My mother is an incredible <br/>\nseamstress---she made my wedding gown and the boys&#39; christening gown (along <br/>\nwith most of my dresses when I was a child). <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a neat thing to be able to do, ....but can I recommend......STITCH <br/>\nWTICHERY???<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58398,"nextTopicId":58399}}
