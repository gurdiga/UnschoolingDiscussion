Skye has managed to <br/>\ninherit our lousy teeth and had to have the top 4 front ones pulled just <br/>\nbefore age 2.  Heather insisted on brushing for a long time, but it seemed <br/>\nto be making Skye dig in more on the issue.  She finally let it <br/>\ngo.  Recently, as Skye is about to turn 7, she has been brushing her teeth <br/>\nvoluntarily.  I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s going to last, but we can <br/>\nhope.  One thing that made it more appealing was buying and electric <br/>\ntoothbrush.  I&#39;m just glad Lars inherited his father&#39;s good teeth.  He just <br/>\nhad a checkup and still no cavities at age 14.
