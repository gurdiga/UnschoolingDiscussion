As far as a <br/>\n personal <br/>\n  relationship with God, biblical-based, spiritual type-Christianity  goes, I <br/>\n  think there are no conflicts with unschooling. Once you get into a doctrine <br/>\n  that attempts to take control and create a lot of extra rules instead of <br/>\n  offering worship and fellowship; therein lies the discrepency. And there <br/>\nyou <br/>\n  have my humble opinion, Lori in TX &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis CAN be true but I tend to look at OR&#39;s as the &quot;one size does NOT fit <br/>\nall&quot;.  Some folks NEED this kind of structure.  Some folks, like myself, can <br/>\ndance pretty freely amongst those who do need more definition.  I guess I <br/>\nthink outside the box, choose to do my innermost living and thinking outside <br/>\nthe box but visit those IN the box.  I like to think it offers more contact <br/>\nwith people and an understanding of how those &quot;inside&quot; think.  I also get <br/>\nbetter and better and gently deflecting their attempts to rein me in.  I even <br/>\nmanage to help them get a glimpse of the dance floor just outside.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for the record, I know quite a few &quot;conservative Christians&quot; who are <br/>\nfairly radical unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nLouisaM<br/>\nbtw - my real name is Kris and from now on I&#39;ll be signing my posts with way. <br/>\n : )</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2882,"nextTopicId":2908}}
