Adriane (12) takes lots of classes<br/>\nand such.  She is at gymnastics 7 hours a week, karate 2 hours, dog training<br/>\n1 hour.  She is in 4-H and is a club officer and a council delegate.  She is<br/>\nin the rabbit project, goat project, sewing project and organic gardening<br/>\nproject.  She is co-chair of the Youth Day committee.  But she LOVES it.<br/>\nShe keeps up with her schedule, she knows she can quit anything at any time.<br/>\nAdriane needs the social stimulation (think the Olsen twins but nicer and<br/>\nthat is Adriane).<br/>\n<br/>\nZach is 10. He plays baseball during season and takes karate a couple of<br/>\ntimes a week.  He is in 4-H but isn&#39;t interested in doing anything but<br/>\nraising his goat.  Zach likes to have lots of free time to interact with<br/>\nobjects in motion through space (any object, any space).<br/>\n<br/>\nMarsie is 6 and takes a gymnastics class once a week.  She likes being in<br/>\nflux, going from activity to activity as she sees fit (something that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t jive too well with classes).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I hear of a class I think the kids might like, or a movie they might<br/>\nlike, or a museum exhibit they might like, etc., I ask them and of course<br/>\nthey tell me how they feel about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53308,"nextTopicId":53431}}
