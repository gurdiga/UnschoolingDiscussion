My daughter will be 11 in March.  It is my belief that she is so sick of reading, from school, that she refuses.  She honestly refuses anything to do with anything that might be &quot;learning&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe will sit for hours tho, and listen to me read to her. We spend about 2 hours every night before bed reading, me aloud, then her sister aloud (she is 8 and has never been to school) and I have lately asked that Emily read.  I told her it&#39;s nice for me to be read to also.  She chose Black Beauty.  She has asked to read for longer, has admitted to loving this book, but still refuses to read on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe enjoys reading the book aloud. But still prefers to be read to.  Where as her sister is frustrated because she can&#39;t read completely on her own yet.  It is funny, Emily, who went to school, still tends to read in a monotone.  Ellen, who never went uses many inflections, laughs while she reads, comments on what will happen....<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we are making baby steps though.  She will now occasionally choose a book from the library.  usually one that she knows her sister will enjoy--or at least that&#39;s what she says.  :)  She has also decided that she loves the Little House Books and has them all ready for me to read in order.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think, Carolyn, if what you are doing works, keep at it.  I have picked out books to read aloud that I remember enjoying and she has enjoyed them also...that&#39;s how we started on Little House...and Black Beauty too.  I know someday, I am not going to be able to read enough to her and she will take over in impatience.  i will joyously let her!<br/>\n<br/>\nI also find that both of them rarely discuss what we have read right away, but later, sometimes weeks later, it comes up...I don&#39;t even realize I am holding my breath until I exhale at those comments!  So, for now, this works...<br/>\n<br/>\nTeri<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMake a difference, help support the relief efforts in the U.S.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clubs.lycos.com/live/events/september11.asp\">http://clubs.lycos.com/live/events/september11.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Carolyn","from":"Carolyn &lt;nielsonc@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"auQYL-TcLgYYLmtNwtIFfmmWKzpgPPuEZn2yRo770Jwuzfc0YLVupkYICVJYScoVvr4xYHW-ebY1KTwVZOzxd3jxGn3o","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"book choosing","postDate":"1002299653","msgId":26718,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNCQkRFMTA0LkRFNTQzRUI1QHBhY2JlbGwubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGJjLjFhYzc5M2VmLjI4ZWJjZjU2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26726,"prevInTime":26717,"nextInTime":26719,"topicId":26718,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been noticing lately that my daughter will not pick out books at the library.

Most of the time, she&#39;s very enthusiastic about what a good<br/>\nbook she just read.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just wondering if I should stop getting her books, in hopes that<br/>\nshe&#39;ll start looking for herself.  I can&#39;t even imagine not wanting to<br/>\npick books out for myself.  On the other hand, I hate messing up a<br/>\nmostly good thing.    Now that I&#39;ve written this, I&#39;m wondering how<br/>\nother kids hear about good books and how they make their choices.
