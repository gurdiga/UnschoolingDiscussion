I know it is a vauge question <br/>\n&gt; but I am having trouble wording it.  How do you handle it when they <br/>\n&gt; do something *wrong*, both if you find out and if they tell you <br/>\n&gt; themselves?  How do you create that trust to *insure* they do come to <br/>\n&gt; you?  Right now, my ds, 4, is pretty open but I want to maintain that <br/>\n&gt; as he gets older (right now it is that mommy I love you stage and <br/>\n&gt; mommy is all good stage&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Like I said, my boys are 8 and 6 so I might not be the best person to answer <br/>\nthat.  It is a process of trust.  I have always trusted that my boys were <br/>\ndoing the best they could.  Meaning that they were not out to get in trouble. <br/>\n They didn&#39;t spill their juice on purpose.  They come to me and say &quot;Mom I <br/>\nspilled my juice on the rug.&quot;  I say &quot;OK do you need help cleaning it up?&quot;  <br/>\nThen they either say no and go get a towel or they say yes and we clean it up <br/>\ntogether.  There is no punishment.  I don&#39;t scream at them for spilling the <br/>\njuice.  And they have just always come to me. I am hoping that by doing these <br/>\nlittle things now that when the challenges are larger they will continue to <br/>\ncome to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also try to help whenever asked.  Even if I think they can do it <br/>\nthemselves.  If my oldest asks me to make him a peanut butter sandwich, <br/>\nunless there is some reason that I can&#39;t, I will say yes.  I don&#39;t say can&#39;t <br/>\nyou do it yourself, even though I know he can.  I just assume that there is a <br/>\nreason that he wants his Mom to make it for him.  Not that he is lazy or <br/>\ntrying to take advantage of me.  I guess I am trying to build a relationship <br/>\nof trust that will carry us through a lifetime, not just a set of rules for <br/>\nnow.<br/>\nHope that makes some sense.<br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69912,"nextTopicId":70189}}
