What I have found is that because <br/>\nthe boys are &quot;out in the world,&quot; seeing people interact with each <br/>\nother, that their &quot;internal&quot; set of morals and manners are just <br/>\nfine.  For example, one day, they were with me at the post office.  <br/>\nThe line was rather slow, they were bored, so they asked if they <br/>\ncould go hold the door open for people.  Of course, I agreed. I <br/>\nthought it a very nice idea, in fact. :) But then, being just 8 and 5 <br/>\nat the time, they couldn&#39;t hold the door open from the outside (heavy <br/>\ndoor)...they had to lean against it from the inside.  That meant that <br/>\npeople had to walk around them a bit when coming through the doorway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost adults would pass around them and thank them very politely.  <br/>\nThey *knew* what the boys were doing and although it actually created <br/>\na bit of an inconvenience, they understood.  They were <br/>\nappreciative. :)  Unfortunately, one lady decided to &quot;scold&quot; them for <br/>\nbeing in the way (they told me this later).  Basically, they <br/>\nsaid &quot;That wasn&#39;t very nice of her, was it, Mama?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that in the artificial environment of school, where natural <br/>\nbehaviors are so &quot;skewed,&quot; children learn to ignore their inner <br/>\nvoice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"manners and morals","postDate":"1082314370","msgId":92823,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMwLjU0NWEzYzdiLjJkYjQyODgyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":92825,"prevInTime":92822,"nextInTime":92824,"topicId":92823,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=--=- I think it is a negative thing for a parent to not present a child with what they think they should know.
