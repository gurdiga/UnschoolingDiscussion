The UU church is not considered Christian by other Christians.  I don t believe that they think they are, either.  Christians believe in the Trinity ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2079292662\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; I am wondering... Why isn&#39;t the UU church Christian? Because they accept<br/>\n&gt; every one? Isn&#39;t that a basic tenant of Christianity?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The UU church is not considered Christian by other Christians.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve that they think they are, either.  Christians believe in the Trinity<br/>\n(Father, Son, Holy Spirit) and that Jesus Christ is the path to God.  The<br/>\nUnitarians believe in 1 God (unity, unitarian), but many routes to that God,<br/>\nand each of us must find our own.  By the way, the Unitarians go back to our<br/>\nfounding fathers (and then some), but merged with the Universalists only in<br/>\nthe last 50 years, I believe, if even that much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; this, why aren&#39;t the Catholic, Mormon and other churches considered<br/>\n&gt; Christian, by other Christian denominations? They consider themselves<br/>\n&gt; Christian. I just don&#39;t get this whole *I&#39;m a Christian, but they aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; because they are ____! I don&#39;t care if they call themselves Christian, their<br/>\n&gt; not!* attitude. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Catholics, back in Vatican II, made many changes to their practice of faith,<br/>\nand accepting salvation outside the Catholic church is one of them.<br/>\nHowever, getting those changes to be part of the belief system of the<br/>\nmembers takes time.  Lots of time.  (Last rites is another, for example.  It<br/>\nwent out with Vatican II, in the 1960&#39;s.  You&#39;d never know it, people still<br/>\nask for it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMany protestants, particularly the &quot;mainline protestans&quot; like Lutherans,<br/>\nMethodists, Presbyterians, etc. have no problem with Catholics.  Some other,<br/>\nmore conservative denominations do.  The emphasis of the Catholic faith is<br/>\non the sacraments (baptism, communion, etc.), and less on your personal<br/>\nrelationship with Jesus Christ.  To some people, the sacraments are the<br/>\nroute to a relationship with God, to others they are so much ritual hooey,<br/>\nand Catholics are missing the boat by not having that relationship with<br/>\nChrist.  Hence, they aren&#39;t Christian enough for certain folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMormons consider themselves Christian, and technically, they are, since<br/>\nChristians are the followers of Christ.  However, the Book of Mormon, and<br/>\nthe 3 other Mormon books that form the basis of their faith tell stories of<br/>\na different nature of Jesus Christ, which do not come under the commonly<br/>\naccepted canon of Christian literature, the Bible.  Because their belief<br/>\nsystem is SO different than most other Christian denominations, for the most<br/>\npart, they are not accepted as Christian by other Christians.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Jews have every bit as many problems with fundamentalism and who&#39;s<br/>\nJewish and who&#39;s not as the rest of us.  Those of us with Christian<br/>\nbackgrounds just aren&#39;t as familiar with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In fact the Catholics and Episcopalians are getting really chummy!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The Episcopal church is the American branch of the Anglican church (Church<br/>\nof England), which split from the Catholics after after the Reformation &<br/>\nCounter-Reformation, which is where most Protestant churches began.  As a<br/>\nresult, they have always had very close ties to the Catholics.  To an<br/>\nextent, the Episcopal church stands between Catholic and Protestant; a bit<br/>\nof each and not totally either.  In the last few years, however, the<br/>\nEpiscopal church signed a major agreement with the Evangelical Lutheran<br/>\nChurch (the largest American Lutheran denomination) which basically says<br/>\nthey can share everything from pastors onwards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So the fundamentalists are really just trying to protect people&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;souls by pointing out who is and isn&#39;t Christian. Sort of the Consumer<br/>\n&gt;Reports of the True Christian faith ;-) (I&#39;m teasing partly but not totally.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know you&#39;re teasing, Joyce, but it&#39;s amazing how accurate that really is.<br/>\nSome Christians can be very exclusive about who is and who isn&#39;t saved,<br/>\nbased on whether they go to the &quot;right&quot; Church and whether their faith is<br/>\ntrue enough.  That frightens me some, that Christians can be so unloving,<br/>\nbut also that we have so much trouble respecting differences and seeing how<br/>\nour beliefs are similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m married to a guy that&#39;s TOTALLY into this stuff, and I&#39;ve learned it by<br/>\ndefault.  ;)  I hope that if you&#39;re still reading that it was somehow<br/>\nuseful.
