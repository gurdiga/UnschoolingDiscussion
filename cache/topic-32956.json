Why unschooling<br/>\ndoes<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mean unparenting.

(Are you here Nancy?) She&#39;s a bit of a ringer (who came up<br/>\n&gt; legitimately! :-) since she&#39;s an ex-AOLer who would have been used to<br/>\nseeing<br/>\n&gt; unparenting used to mean not parenting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/library/essays/essay09.shtml\">http://www.unschooling.com/library/essays/essay09.shtml</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unschooling scares people, because there are no guarantees. What they<br/>\nfail to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; realize is, public school, private school, or school-at-home offer no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guarantees, either. What unschooling is about is *freedom.* How it<br/>\nappears in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different homes is as individual as the child himself. It does not mean<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;unparenting,&quot; though a wide range of parenting philosophies are<br/>\npracticed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (most unschoolers are pretty relaxed, though, since you aren&#39;t trying to<br/>\nforce<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the kids to do things all day long). The basic tenet is not new age;<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;what is best for this individual person, my child?&quot; In some cases,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschooling parents will find their child desires a structured<br/>\ncurriculum, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they provide it. The difference is in WHO is asking for the curriculum,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; who is responsible for doing it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then, after many animation references, a frustratingly unlinked (or<br/>\nperhaps<br/>\n&gt; unparented?) link to an essay entitled &quot;Unschooling or Unparenting?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And another missing page that starts: &quot;... My response to that is to<br/>\nremind<br/>\n&gt; them that unschooling doesn&#39;t mean &quot;unparenting&quot;. My kids have plenty of<br/>\n&gt; responsibilities and structure in their lives. It&#39;s ...&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Finally an independent, relevent use which ironically ties into the<br/>\nfeminism<br/>\n&gt; discussion :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gotcannedgoods.com/a_didactic_dialectic/add18-15Feb2001.cfm\">http://gotcannedgoods.com/a_didactic_dialectic/add18-15Feb2001.cfm</a><br/>\n&gt; (waaaaay down at the bottom)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In the end, the values of feminism and individualism are good. The<br/>\nproblem is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that our time-place has not yet developed the cultural responses to<br/>\ncompensate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for the familial losses feminism has helped create. We have yet to solve<br/>\nsuch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; problems as homemakerless houses, unparenting parents, independencism,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; isolationism (oh yea, lots of us feel alone and depressed Â­ where have<br/>\nour<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grandparents gone?!). I think it is the undervaluing of the family, and<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; overvaluing of the individual, that produced this mess. (We value the<br/>\ngroup<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as a whole very much, btw). We forget our place in life: our duty. We<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not frogs; we are mammals: we must raise our young with precious time<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; energy if we want to make them happy and successful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And then, frustratingly, a reference that could arguably go either way<br/>\nfrom<br/>\n&gt; a Pagan homeschooling page:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.tripod.com/acorns3/acorns9.html\">http://members.tripod.com/acorns3/acorns9.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My view of this is that people sort themselves out by associating with<br/>\nothers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; based on commonalities and what meets their needs as time goes by.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Homeschooling families may find that they actually have little in common<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; &gt; each other, except for an intense interest in the well-being of their<br/>\nchildren<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and a desire to be left alone by the school district. Families who come<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this primarily from a religious motivation may share a great deal more<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; &gt; each other; many such groups dictate a unified way of life. However, the<br/>\nmore<br/>\n&gt; &gt; secular homeschoolers are indeed a diverse lot, particularly the adults.<br/>\nThey<br/>\n&gt; &gt; include rich and poor, mainstream and alternative lifestyles, families<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; &gt; professional degrees and those with high school diplomas, urban,<br/>\nsuburban and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rural, liberal and conservative, young and middle-aged, new and old<br/>\n&gt; &gt; homeschoolers, etc. Even with regard to child-rearing, homeschoolers<br/>\ninclude<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all philosophies from what I call unparenting to rigid behavior<br/>\nmanagement. Is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there any reason to think all these folks are likely to be friends?<br/>\nAbout the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only way to bring them all together would be in defense of homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; itself, if the legislature were proposing some drastic reduction of our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rights. Even then, each part of the homeschooling &quot;community&quot; would have<br/>\nits<br/>\n&gt; &gt; own critique and analysis of the proposal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And another vote for unparenting being a pejorative term:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/wrightway2/011500.htm\">http://www.geocities.com/wrightway2/011500.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; I read a post on the internet later that evening that really hit home as<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what was missing in our unschooling efforts, other than compliance :)<br/>\nThe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lady that posted said she felt that unschoolers actually have more<br/>\nstructure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than other homeschoolers - only internal not external. We expect our<br/>\nkids to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; learn to care for themselves. She said &quot;that being responsible for your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; actions and taking care of what God gives you is completely biblical.<br/>\nShe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also said that unschooling doesn&#39;t mean unparenting&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joyce<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
