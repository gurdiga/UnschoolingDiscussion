He does have interests, but is <br/>\noften saying he is bored and wants to go somewhere. We usually go <br/>\nsomewhere new at least once a week, but he rarely admits that it&#39;s <br/>\nfun, even if I see him enjoy the activity. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, some of the dumbest things I&#39;ve heard about homeschooling, <br/>\nor the &quot;choice&quot; to homeschool, have been made by my mother in her <br/>\ndesperate attempts to convince me to &quot;send him to High school.&quot; She <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Do you think he&#39;s really old enough to make that kind of <br/>\nchoice?&quot;  &quot;Maybe he wouldn&#39;t be so bored if he went school, where he <br/>\ncould be exposed to all kinds of things, and trying new things that <br/>\nyou can&#39;t expose him to because you have the other two little ones <br/>\nthere.&quot; (The  &quot;little ones&quot; are 8yo and 5yo) I told her that how can <br/>\nschool expose him to more than the world outside of school, besides <br/>\nthe fact that he&#39;s already been to school and he knows what they <br/>\nhave to offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a more personal note, my mother said, &quot;It&#39;s (homeschooling) is <br/>\nfine for the younger ones because it&#39;s working. I don&#39;t see it <br/>\nworking with him (my 13yo). He&#39;s not doing anything. He&#39;s unhappy <br/>\nand he resents you.&quot; I was too defensive to even think to ask her <br/>\nhow she knew he resents me! But it immediately filled me with such <br/>\nGUILT! I&#39;m pretty sure that he is past the point where he would give <br/>\nup his freedom to jump through the hoops of traditonal school. We&#39;ve <br/>\ntalked about it. But could he be resenting me for starting us all <br/>\ndown this path?  I can&#39;t really talk to him right now, because he is <br/>\non his first trip to a sleepover camp!!! Ugghhhhh!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe none of this is remotely related. Maybe I&#39;m just grasping at <br/>\nstraws because I&#39;m panicky, with no one to talk to right now. It&#39;s <br/>\nso true, &quot;with great freedom, comes great responsibility.&quot; (Who said <br/>\nthat?) I thought I had courage in making the choice to unschool, but <br/>\nI think I need to review the risks of NOT unschooling. I think I <br/>\ncould use some backup here, if anyone is so inclined (or not too <br/>\nworn out from reading this post!)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeanne<br/>\n(counting the days until the L&L conference -- 117)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106545,"nextTopicId":106585}}
