Let me define this register as that level of speech which we<br/>\nassociate with Triple-J and other forms of media addressed to our hapless<br/>\nyoung. Next we might consider the level of educated discourse, the kind<br/>\nof speech that one would expect to hear in ordinary conversation between<br/>\neducated people. Then there are technical registers: the language of<br/>\nsailors, or motor mechanics, or cricketers for example. This leads on to<br/>\nliterary registers � the language of books � which may themselves be<br/>\nclassified chronologically: Johnsonian, Shakespearean, Chaucerian English<br/>\nfor example.<br/>\n_____________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBook to check out if you are really interested in the topic:<br/>\n<br/>\nDimensions of Register Variation<br/>\nA Cross-Linguistic Comparison<br/>\nDouglas Biber<br/>\n ISBN: 0521473314<br/>\n_____________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve read this far you must be interested . . . <br/>\nThere seems to be a brewing debate among linguists who want to separate<br/>\ndifferences based on profession or technology from differences based on<br/>\nsocio-economic status and situational differences.
