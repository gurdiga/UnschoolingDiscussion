So if it is going to be a health or safety hazard, or if <br/>\nyour daughter will lose things, she might want to choose to be extra <br/>\nvigilant.

Personally, I separate my parents from our own parenting <br/>\ndecisions. They can agree or disagree with them, but that doesn&#39;t <br/>\nchange what we decide.

I constantly tell him about something I read somewhere or print something out to be read and I share all the little bits that I pick up here. Mine is quite open to unschooling, but sometimes he feels uneasy with the parenting practices that go together with the philosophy. I shamelesly repeat phrases that I pick up here. Last night we talked about how I think we as a family should encourage team efforts more - instead of saying please pick up your blocks, say let&#39;s pick up your blocks. His response was that would only teach him to do nothing at all. I asked why expect the worst from him and I could see that thought really clicked with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain this morning we spoke about him pushing independence - I feel it will happen when my DS is ready - last week someone mentioned how she often reminds her husband that he had 30 years before kids to himself and probably will have another 30 after kids.

Before, they felt like they were &#39;missing out&#39; on something if they went to play outside instead of watching every Simpson&#39;s episode. (Had to be inside @ 5p. to watch it every day no matter how much fun they were having.)   Now, they spend much more time on other interests.   At first, my ds would watch hours of Animal Planet, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, Discovery, etc....  Hours and hours.  Gradually, I think he got bored with the TV.   Lately, he has been spending hours playing with his Transformers, army guys, looking at toy catalogs (gotta have that list ready for Mema), whittling, playing Sorry with dd, and even reading.  He now only watches about 2-3 hours a day.  Somedays he spends the whole day outside and doesn&#39;t watch at all.  And only because I quit controlling it.  At least that&#39;s the way it seems to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       &lt;&lt;&lt;2.  Cleaning there rooms.... Do you require that your kids keep their <br/>\nroom clean or just close the door. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids&#39; rooms are marginal............at least by my standards.  There are dirty clothes, Polly Pocket pieces, Barbie stuff, books, and lots of shoes in my dd&#39;s floor.  I like things very neat.  She doesn&#39;t.  We usually try to compromise on room cleaning.  I won&#39;t go round up their dirty clothes, so they have to take them to the laundry room if they want them washed.  Usually, when I am doing laundry, I have to haul my stuff from my bathroom and I will let everyone know &quot;Hey guys, I&#39;m washing some clothes.........better bring &#39;em out if you want them clean.&quot;  Usually, they are glad that their favorite outfit will get washed and everyone scurries about to get dirty stuff to the laundry room.  It works for us.  :)  I have also started using a milk crate for each family member&#39;s clean clothes.  When it is full, they can take it to their room and put away the stuff.  ( I read that on this board, I think.  Great idea!  Thanks!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the dirty dishes, I kinda do the same thing when I load the dishwasher daily.  I will announce that &quot;I need all the dirty dishes, please.  I am gonna run the d/w.&quot;   Dishes start flowing back into the kitchen pretty quickly without much grumbling.  I think it&#39;s because they have seen the &#39;science experiments&#39; that can come from dirty dishes left in a room too long.  I also remind them that if they want to be able to eat/drink things throughout the house, that they really have to be able to get their dirty dishes back to the sink.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       &lt;&lt;&lt;3.  What about when their messiness intrude on others space.  I have a <br/>\nchild that always leave their clothes on the bathroom floor.  It drives <br/>\neveryone else crazy to have to step over it.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am too neat freaky to let the stuff lay around too long.  Usually about once or twice a day I will announce that it&#39;s getting too messy for me in here...... living room, kitchen, bathroom... any &#39;public area&#39;.   They grumble a little but they do know &#39;mom is just that way about it&#39; and usually comply without too much trouble.  We work together to make it look neater, gather up the dirty dishes, put away the forgotten card game, and pick up the trash. ( my dd thinks the floor is her trash can....any wrapper she opens still falls to the floor.)  It only takes about 10-15 minutes to pick up, Mom is happier, and they have the room to start a new project/game/puzzle. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKimber<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117801964,"authorName":"Todd M.","from":"&quot;Todd M.&quot; &lt;Ozarkren@...&gt;","profile":"trozark","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] few questions from a newbie","postDate":"1035045934","msgId":46882,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4xLjYuMi4yMDAyMTAxOTExMzUxNS4wMDlmZDAxMEBlZGlzb24ucmlwaW50ZXJuZXQuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDZmLjJmOTAwMTY3LjJhZTJkMzk3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46881,"nextInTopic":46883,"prevInTime":46881,"nextInTime":46883,"topicId":46878,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... == Congratulations to you all :-) ... == I m sure you ll get lots of not-so-quick answers to them.  ... == Keep in mind that she s spent the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-257383279\">At 11:26 AM 10/19/02 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have just pulled my children from public school this year and after<br/>\n&gt;researching many life styles have chosen to work hard at a life style of<br/>\n&gt;unschooling.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>==<br/>\nCongratulations to you all :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Now for a few quick questions.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>==<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get lots of &#39;not-so-quick&#39; answers to them. &lt;smiling&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;          1.

I have a friend who <br/>\nwas reported to children and youth for a messy house, and one of the <br/>\nthings they checked was the bedrooms.  She was told to have them <br/>\nclean by the next day or the children would be removed.  I don&#39;t ever <br/>\nwant to face a situation like that.  When I say clean, I mean that <br/>\nclothes can&#39;t be on the floor up to the knees.  No dirty dishes or <br/>\ndirty clothes on the floor.  There has to be a path to the bed.  <br/>\nRight now dd&#39;s big problem is too much stuff in too small of a room. <br/>\nI&#39;ve never forbidden it, but for some reason no one ever brings food <br/>\nupstairs except for water on the nightstand.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;        3.
