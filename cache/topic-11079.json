Most soy milks are slightly sweet, so you don&#39;t need to add sugar to<br/>\nunsweetened cereal. I like plain soy milk, not the vanilla).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen with boxing up books, loading boxes into the van, driving to the<br/>\nconference, unloading boxes from the van and then unboxing books and setting<br/>\nup displays - well you can see it was physically demanding work. Under such<br/>\nspecial circumstances, Nancy usually keeps me motivated and going strong by<br/>\nsupplying me with a bag of special &quot;power pellets&quot; that can be found at many<br/>\nstores. They have a crunchy, protein center derived from a plant overlaid<br/>\nwith a sweet, dark colored high energy compound which is covered with a<br/>\nhard, brightly colored shell so that they only melt in your mouth, not in<br/>\nyour hand. They go by initials that when combined spell the sound I make<br/>\nwhen I eat them! (LOL) A 10 oz bag supplied most of my nutrition for the<br/>\nrest of the day (I told you didn&#39;t want to know!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not typical of course, but I think it points out that being<br/>\nvegetarian doesn&#39;t necessarily mean being some fanatic, ascetic,<br/>\nnutritionally obsessed oddball. People don&#39;t realize how easy it can be to<br/>\neat vegetarian, and how many meals are easily adapted.<br/>\n<br/>\nBreakfast can be cereal. If you are ovo-lacto vegetarian (eat eggs & dairy<br/>\nproducts), you can have an omelet or french toast. Pancakes, waffles - are<br/>\nyou feeling deprived yet?<br/>\n<br/>\nLunch can be a soup and a sandwich. For canned soups, I like Progresso<br/>\nLentil soup. One of my favorite &quot;treat&quot; sandwiches is a toasted bagel with<br/>\ncrisped Breakfast Strips (Morningstar Farms), a slice of tomato, and<br/>\nlettuce. A BLT never tasted so good!<br/>\n<br/>\nDinner can be spaghetti (just no meatballs), pizza, tacos with refried bean<br/>\nfilling instead of meat (most name brand canned refried beans are no longer<br/>\nmade with lard, but check to be sure), lasagna, pierogis, french fries -<br/>\nlots of &quot;normal&quot; food. And yes, you can have salad too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you eat out, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Wendy&#39;s, and Subway have the best<br/>\nselection of fast food vegetarian offering, although we have gone to<br/>\nMcDonald and Burger King and ordered cheeseburgers with lettuce and tomato<br/>\ninstead of the beef.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more upscale restaurants, Chinese and Italian also tend to have many<br/>\nselections that are naturally meatless. But as with the fast food, even if<br/>\nthey don&#39;t list a meatless offering, they can usually prepare a dish without<br/>\nmeat if you request it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people don&#39;t realize that even a generation or two ago, meat was not a<br/>\nmain course the way it is today. It was usually more of a side dish and<br/>\nportions were much smaller. This is especially true of the South were more<br/>\nvegetables were available.<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; So what do you<br/>\n&gt; eat?

I have read them before but don&#39;t remember them...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jaam1224@cs.com","from":"Jaam1224@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"XqGtWNXf8yXeH08reaUJs-DLsIMKHfpTN__zl3Qj_cOIqrXvE59nCsMU8shJz_yXSnpkGpKE","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: vegans","postDate":"963588329","msgId":11079,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGExLjgwOWM2NWQuMjZhMDhhZTlAY3MuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11084,"prevInTime":11078,"nextInTime":11080,"topicId":11079,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/14/00 8:56:20 AM Eastern Daylight Time, FUNLists@IQCweb.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-964804255\">In a message dated 7/14/00 8:56:20 AM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FUNLists@...\">FUNLists@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; If you are having problems with wild mood swings and blood sugar levels, it<br/>\n is more likely to be because of something you are eating, not because you<br/>\n aren&#39;t eating meat or getting enough protein. Maybe you are getting too many<br/>\n simple carbohydrates or waiting too long between meals. &gt;&gt;<br/>\nBilly,<br/>\nThis could be a possibility.    I was eating tons of pasta and fresh vegies, <br/>\nlittle eggs and dairy and almost no meat.  So what do you eat?  Please share <br/>\nwhat you have eaten in, say the last 2-3 days, just to give us hopefulls some <br/>\nideas.  I think part of my problem is not know what to eat or how to prepare <br/>\nit so it is tasty.  If you could pass along some simple no lose receipes, <br/>\nthat would help too......Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11141,"nextTopicId":11112}}
