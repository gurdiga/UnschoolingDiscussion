I&#39;d really love<br/>\n&gt;  to read these numerous studies.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; You believe that you cannot be supportive *and* set<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; boundaries/inflict a certain amount of stress?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I believe I am a helper.  And yes, I avoid causing her stress.<br/>\n&gt;  Sometimes I f*** up, and in that situation, I am the first to tell her,<br/>\n&gt;  and I am the first to apologize.  Purposely inflicting anything on<br/>\n&gt;  anyone seems very wrong.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; My<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; son, for instance, finds it extremely stressful to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; talk about or deal with learning social skills such as<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; meeting people&#39;s eyes, dealing with bullies, making<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; friendly advances to people, etc... but if I indulge<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; him in his avoidant behavior he will not learn these<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; things,<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Or maybe, just like talking or walking, he would learn these things on<br/>\n&gt;  his own, when he felt ready.  &quot;Sorry, Johnny, I know you can&#39;t swim and<br/>\n&gt;  you are very afraid of the water, but lets just start you right here in<br/>\n&gt;  the cold deep end, shall we?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; and without them he is vulnerable to a variety<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; of abuses from others.  I might look like a bad guy<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; for a little while to him... as I did when I did<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; holding therapy with him as a toddler<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Again, I mention the method used in Son-Rise.<br/>\n&gt;  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.option.org/index.html\">http://www.option.org/index.html</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; ... but in the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; long run he will benefit and it will make our<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; relationship stronger (as the holding therapy did,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; although at the time it was *very* stressful and<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; unpleasant).<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  How do you know it will make your relationship stronger.

Why can&#39;t we talk about the best possible<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; situations for our<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; children?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I believe I am.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  How is it the best thing to inflict stress?  I suppose you felt it was<br/>\n&gt;  just jim dandy when Dad said you had to go to bed now even though you<br/>\n&gt;  weren&#39;t tired?  Or Mom pestered you thirty times a day to say please, as<br/>\n&gt;  if you weren&#39;t smart enough to figure it out?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Why are you assuming that this is not what I am<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; espousing?  Why is setting reasonable boundaries not a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; part of our duties to make life a &#39;best possible<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; experience&#39;?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Who decides what &quot;reasonable&quot; boundaries are?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Lots of studies show that children feel<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; frustrated and angry with boundaries when they are<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; inconvenient to temporary urges, but long-term are<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; more secure and better able to deal with the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; vicissitudes of life.  What&#39;s so bad about that?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  How can a study show that a child is more secure when his trusted<br/>\n&gt;  helpers are voluntarily and methodically planting known stressors in his<br/>\n&gt;  path?  I do not see how a study could use this kind of reasoning.<br/>\n&gt;  Again, I beg to read these many studies.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I find that the school system available to us is not<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; aimed to provide a &#39;reasonable&#39; amount of stress for a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; child of my particular child&#39;s combination of needs<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; and personality traits... the amount of stress caused<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; by the sexual harassment and physical abuse he is<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; experiencing there goes beyond his ability to cope.  I<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; could, of course, be wrong.  I hope not.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;m sure he is better off at home.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I am also not entirely unschooling my child, in the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; pure sense of the word.  I am adjusting the process to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; fit my and my child&#39;s needs as best I can... we will<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; have a certain amount of housework scheduled in, for<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; instance, although I know my child will find this<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; stressful and unpleasant to some degree. Tough.  Ifind it unpleasant,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; too, to a much greater degree<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I understand that you are ill, and I am sorry, but how do you know that<br/>\n&gt;  you find it more unpleasant?  And if it is so unpleasant, maybe you<br/>\n&gt;  could brainstorm for some better options.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; (because it is physically painful for me), but it<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; needs to be done, and as part of the family unit he<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; has the responsibility (IMO as his parent) to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; participate in the necessary processes of upkeeping<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the family&#39;s quality of life.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Is quality of life synonymous with a clean house?  Is quality of life<br/>\n&gt;  synonymous with stress?  Is quality of life synonymous with imposing<br/>\n&gt;  one&#39;s will upon another being?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I can empathize with<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; his frustration, I can help him problem solve to make<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; it as easy to tolerate as possible... that will<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; hopefully give him some useful coping skills to use in<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the future.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I agree.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; But he still needs to deal with it, like<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; it or not, and I will be inflicting stress... and<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; believe that it will be good for him.  Same goes for<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the social training.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Some people like to be alone.  Social training, for them, would be<br/>\n&gt;  synonymous to forced basketball practice for someone who loathes sports.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I think in the end it is more<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; important for me to be his parent than to be his<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; friend, when I have to choose between one and the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; other... I believe that in doing so I am being more<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; truly his friend in the long run.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  What is your distinction between parent and friend?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; AND I think he will still manage to find me a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; supportive person in the fulfillment of his dreams...<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I hope he does.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Sarah Anderson-Thimmes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________<br/>\nSend a cool gift with your E-Card<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bluemountain.com/giftcenter/\">http://www.bluemountain.com/giftcenter/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tami Labig-Duquette","from":"&quot;Tami Labig-Duquette&quot; &lt;labigduquette@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"uT7T-HXpflOkp5-7OZHM0S_9MoqyAXYXzp1fozNv7jRWn3bWStwl6Z5FTTAOKKotcaEnO0N5MWgIj5GWmm-ureYOE72raLwdAQrEy6NxNscAc_K7R6BDDA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Brain atrophy (Eileen)","postDate":"989996348","msgId":21306,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY5N3poVk9Kd256c0xxSWZRZG0wMDAwMGE3M0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":21305,"nextInTopic":21308,"prevInTime":21305,"nextInTime":21307,"topicId":21298,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Now I read this original post and deleted because, well I just did not have the words.

I am saying that<br/>\n&gt;children get a pretty incredible amount of stress naturally.  Nobody<br/>\n&gt;needs to impose it upon them.  I also think it is a sad statement to say<br/>\n&gt;that a child is in for a miserable life if they have a happy childhood.<br/>\n&gt;My definition of happy childhood=adult helpers showing children how to<br/>\n&gt;avoid stress, not run right into it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am saying that it is a parental duty to impose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; boundaries.  When we say &#39;do not touch the element<br/>\n&gt; &gt; coils on the stove, because it is hot and will burn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;, that is a boundary.  When we say &#39;you may play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with your friend for two hours, and then we must<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;must?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; go to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the store to get food for dinner&#39;, that is a boundary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In our house, we would try to find a better solution.  I might suggest<br/>\n&gt;that the child could stay with the friend while I went to the grocery<br/>\n&gt;store, or wait until Dad got home, or hire a sitter, or wait until the<br/>\n&gt;morning when the child wants to go to the store.  I might suggest we<br/>\n&gt;order pizza or eat *gasp* spaghettios.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Often children find these boundaries frustrating and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unpleasant, but for their own good and the good of our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; families,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How is this good for the family?  I have never seen a family that is<br/>\n&gt;happy at the expense of someone else&#39;s happiness.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is important to help our kids learn to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tolerate a certain amount of frustration, anger, hurt,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Perhaps a parent could help the child learn to experience anger.  A<br/>\n&gt;parent need not inflict this frustration or hurt in order to help a<br/>\n&gt;child.  The child will get plenty in due time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so, I would love to hear one source stating this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fact.  No one needs to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have stress imposed on them, particularly by a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trusted advisor, namely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their parent.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes, they do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ummm, nah.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Otherwise the world imposes an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unnecessary amount of stress on them later in the form<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of burns, social ostracism, inability to deal with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grief, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How do you know this?  When I hear of grown unschoolers, free schoolers,<br/>\n&gt;and adults with relatively easy childhoods, I hear of  people who seem<br/>\n&gt;happy and fulfilled.  These are the people who are not focusing on the<br/>\n&gt;horrors of the world.  These are the people that bounce back from the<br/>\n&gt;burns and social ostracism because these are the people with high self<br/>\n&gt;esteems, people with unconditional love backing them, people who trust<br/>\n&gt;the world because, at least, they could trust their parents as toddlers<br/>\n&gt;and young children, and even teens.

I might suggest<br/>\nthat the child could stay with the friend while I went to the grocery<br/>\nstore, or wait until Dad got home, or hire a sitter, or wait until the<br/>\nmorning when the child wants to go to the store.  I might suggest we<br/>\norder pizza or eat *gasp* spaghettios.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Often children find these boundaries frustrating and<br/>\n&gt; unpleasant, but for their own good and the good of our<br/>\n&gt; families,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How is this good for the family?

A<br/>\nparent need not inflict this frustration or hurt in order to help a<br/>\nchild.  The child will get plenty in due time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so, I would love to hear one source stating this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fact.

When I hear of grown unschoolers, free schoolers,<br/>\nand adults with relatively easy childhoods, I hear of  people who seem<br/>\nhappy and fulfilled.  These are the people who are not focusing on the<br/>\nhorrors of the world.  These are the people that bounce back from the<br/>\nburns and social ostracism because these are the people with high self<br/>\nesteems, people with unconditional love backing them, people who trust<br/>\nthe world because, at least, they could trust their parents as toddlers<br/>\nand young children, and even teens.  These are the people who can handle<br/>\nchallenges because boundaries  weren&#39;t arbitrarily crammed down their<br/>\nthroats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also wondering what your world view is?

Many studies have been<br/>\n&gt; done (in the US and in the Netherlands, particularly)<br/>\n&gt; on prosocial behavior, depression and anxiety, and<br/>\n&gt; abusive/aggressive personalities, all of which have<br/>\n&gt; shown that children who are overprotected from<br/>\n&gt; experiencing a certain amount of stress grow up<br/>\n&gt; without being given the chance to learn (primarily<br/>\n&gt; through parental role modeling and parental behavioral<br/>\n&gt; training/counseling) valuable skills in dealing with<br/>\n&gt; stress, adverse behavior of others, frustration,<br/>\n&gt; anger, compromise and negotiation, prosocial behavior,<br/>\n&gt; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Could you please give me the source, link, reference?

And yes, I avoid causing her stress.<br/>\nSometimes I f*** up, and in that situation, I am the first to tell her,<br/>\nand I am the first to apologize.  Purposely inflicting anything on<br/>\nanyone seems very wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My<br/>\n&gt; son, for instance, finds it extremely stressful to<br/>\n&gt; talk about or deal with learning social skills such as<br/>\n&gt; meeting people&#39;s eyes, dealing with bullies, making<br/>\n&gt; friendly advances to people, etc... but if I indulge<br/>\n&gt; him in his avoidant behavior he will not learn these<br/>\n&gt; things,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Or maybe, just like talking or walking, he would learn these things on<br/>\nhis own, when he felt ready.  &quot;Sorry, Johnny, I know you can&#39;t swim and<br/>\nyou are very afraid of the water, but lets just start you right here in<br/>\nthe cold deep end, shall we?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and without them he is vulnerable to a variety<br/>\n&gt; of abuses from others.  I might look like a bad guy<br/>\n&gt; for a little while to him... as I did when I did<br/>\n&gt; holding therapy with him as a toddler<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I mention the method used in Son-Rise.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.option.org/index.html\">http://www.option.org/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ... but in the<br/>\n&gt; long run he will benefit and it will make our<br/>\n&gt; relationship stronger (as the holding therapy did,<br/>\n&gt; although at the time it was *very* stressful and<br/>\n&gt; unpleasant).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How do you know it will make your relationship stronger.  Do you feel<br/>\nespecially tight with those who have imposed their will on you?  Do you<br/>\nthink, &quot;Thank God you knowingly inflicted stress on me, I feel honored,<br/>\nand now we&#39;re just as tight as we can be.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; It is painful for any loving parent to see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their child experience pain and even suffering,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certainly we don&#39;t want our children to experience<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more pain than they can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (developmentally/personality-wise) handle, but the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; best favor we can do them is teaching them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; effective<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; skills for *handling* those experiences, not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; protecting them from ever experiencing them at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why?  Why can&#39;t we talk about the best possible<br/>\n&gt; &gt; situations for our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I believe I am.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How is it the best thing to inflict stress?  I suppose you felt it was<br/>\njust jim dandy when Dad said you had to go to bed now even though you<br/>\nweren&#39;t tired?  Or Mom pestered you thirty times a day to say please, as<br/>\nif you weren&#39;t smart enough to figure it out?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Why are you assuming that this is not what I am<br/>\n&gt; espousing?  Why is setting reasonable boundaries not a<br/>\n&gt; part of our duties to make life a &#39;best possible<br/>\n&gt; experience&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who decides what &quot;reasonable&quot; boundaries are?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Lots of studies show that children feel<br/>\n&gt; frustrated and angry with boundaries when they are<br/>\n&gt; inconvenient to temporary urges, but long-term are<br/>\n&gt; more secure and better able to deal with the<br/>\n&gt; vicissitudes of life.  What&#39;s so bad about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How can a study show that a child is more secure when his trusted<br/>\nhelpers are voluntarily and methodically planting known stressors in his<br/>\npath?  I do not see how a study could use this kind of reasoning.<br/>\nAgain, I beg to read these many studies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I find that the school system available to us is not<br/>\n&gt; aimed to provide a &#39;reasonable&#39; amount of stress for a<br/>\n&gt; child of my particular child&#39;s combination of needs<br/>\n&gt; and personality traits... the amount of stress caused<br/>\n&gt; by the sexual harassment and physical abuse he is<br/>\n&gt; experiencing there goes beyond his ability to cope.

Many studies have been<br/>\ndone (in the US and in the Netherlands, particularly)<br/>\non prosocial behavior, depression and anxiety, and<br/>\nabusive/aggressive personalities, all of which have<br/>\nshown that children who are overprotected from<br/>\nexperiencing a certain amount of stress grow up<br/>\nwithout being given the chance to learn (primarily<br/>\nthrough parental role modeling and parental behavioral<br/>\ntraining/counseling) valuable skills in dealing with<br/>\nstress, adverse behavior of others, frustration,<br/>\nanger, compromise and negotiation, prosocial behavior,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\n I hope to be the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; least stressful person in her life, the person who<br/>\n&gt; helps her achieve her<br/>\n&gt; dreams, not the person inflicting stress so she is<br/>\n&gt; adequately prepared<br/>\n&gt; to enter a harsh world in umpteen years.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>You believe that you cannot be supportive *and* set<br/>\nboundaries/inflict a certain amount of stress?  My<br/>\nson, for instance, finds it extremely stressful to<br/>\ntalk about or deal with learning social skills such as<br/>\nmeeting people&#39;s eyes, dealing with bullies, making<br/>\nfriendly advances to people, etc... but if I indulge<br/>\nhim in his avoidant behavior he will not learn these<br/>\nthings, and without them he is vulnerable to a variety<br/>\nof abuses from others.  I might look like a bad guy<br/>\nfor a little while to him... as I did when I did<br/>\nholding therapy with him as a toddler... but in the<br/>\nlong run he will benefit and it will make our<br/>\nrelationship stronger (as the holding therapy did,<br/>\nalthough at the time it was *very* stressful and<br/>\nunpleasant).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; It is painful for any loving parent to see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their child experience pain and even suffering,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; certainly we don&#39;t want our children to experience<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more pain than they can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (developmentally/personality-wise) handle, but the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; best favor we can do them is teaching them<br/>\n&gt; effective<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skills for *handling* those experiences, not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; protecting them from ever experiencing them at<br/>\n&gt; all!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why?  Why can&#39;t we talk about the best possible<br/>\n&gt; situations for our<br/>\n&gt; children? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe I am.<br/>\n<br/>\n Why can&#39;t we, as aware and kind parents,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tell our children<br/>\n&gt; about a potentially harmful situation?  If they<br/>\n&gt; still choose that<br/>\n&gt; situation, why isn&#39;t it our duty to be there to make<br/>\n&gt; it the best<br/>\n&gt; possible experience?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why are you assuming that this is not what I am<br/>\nespousing?  Why is setting reasonable boundaries not a<br/>\npart of our duties to make life a &#39;best possible<br/>\nexperience&#39;?  Lots of studies show that children feel<br/>\nfrustrated and angry with boundaries when they are<br/>\ninconvenient to temporary urges, but long-term are<br/>\nmore secure and better able to deal with the<br/>\nvicissitudes of life.  What&#39;s so bad about that?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are you an unschooling/deschooling/free learning? <br/>\n&gt; If so, why?  To<br/>\n&gt; protect your child or children from unnecessary<br/>\n&gt; stress?  To give them<br/>\n&gt; the best possible start?  To be with them?  To help<br/>\n&gt; them?  To ensure<br/>\n&gt; that their ability to trust, exhibit kindness, and<br/>\n&gt; focus on love does<br/>\n&gt; not atrophy?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find that the school system available to us is not<br/>\naimed to provide a &#39;reasonable&#39; amount of stress for a<br/>\nchild of my particular child&#39;s combination of needs<br/>\nand personality traits... the amount of stress caused<br/>\nby the sexual harassment and physical abuse he is<br/>\nexperiencing there goes beyond his ability to cope.  I<br/>\ncould, of course, be wrong.  I hope not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am also not entirely unschooling my child, in the<br/>\npure sense of the word.  I am adjusting the process to<br/>\nfit my and my child&#39;s needs as best I can... we will<br/>\nhave a certain amount of housework scheduled in, for<br/>\ninstance, although I know my child will find this<br/>\nstressful and unpleasant to some degree.  Tough.  I<br/>\nfind it unpleasant, too, to a much greater degree<br/>\n(because it is physically painful for me), but it<br/>\nneeds to be done, and as part of the family unit he<br/>\nhas the responsibility (IMO as his parent) to<br/>\nparticipate in the necessary processes of upkeeping<br/>\nthe family&#39;s quality of life.  I can empathize with<br/>\nhis frustration, I can help him problem solve to make<br/>\nit as easy to tolerate as possible... that will<br/>\nhopefully give him some useful coping skills to use in<br/>\nthe future.  But he still needs to deal with it, like<br/>\nit or not, and I will be inflicting stress... and<br/>\nbelieve that it will be good for him.  Same goes for<br/>\nthe social training.  I think in the end it is more<br/>\nimportant for me to be his parent than to be his<br/>\nfriend, when I have to choose between one and the<br/>\nother... I believe that in doing so I am being more<br/>\ntruly his friend in the long run.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND I think he will still manage to find me a<br/>\nsupportive person in the fulfillment of his dreams...<br/>\n<br/>\nEileen<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
