The patient is unable to focus on the learning needs or desires of<br/>\n&gt; any individual child (or at least not for more than 3 minutes at a<br/>\n&gt; time<br/>\n&gt; -- hence the &quot;attention deficit&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; 2. The patient is unable to interact flexibly with the learning<br/>\n&gt; timetable of any individual child.  On the contrary, the patient<br/>\n&gt; expresses irritability (sometimes extreme) when children cannot or<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; not conform to his or her teaching timetable.<br/>\n&gt; 3.  The patient suffers from a minor form of dementia or other<br/>\n&gt; &quot;thought<br/>\n&gt; disorder&quot; and believes that learning takes place through the<br/>\n&gt; unadulterated transfer of information from her or his own head to that<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; of another.  At its worst, this thought disorder may express itself in<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; feelings of grandiosity regarding one&#39;s own thoughts, and a belief<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; little is to be gained by allowing children to express their own.  It<br/>\n&gt; may also manifest itself in tone of voice.<br/>\n&gt; 4.  The patient suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorders.  These<br/>\n&gt; may<br/>\n&gt; take the form of requiring regimentation in arrangment of furniture,<br/>\n&gt; rigorous requirements regarding handwriting or form of address, the<br/>\n&gt; lining up of objects or other human beings in size places or<br/>\n&gt; alphabetically, a lack of regard for the personal space of others, the<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; overly fastidious arrangement of materials on walls and bulletin<br/>\n&gt; boards,<br/>\n&gt; and a sometimes fanatical regard for the importance of what s/he<br/>\n&gt; regards<br/>\n&gt; as &quot;neatness&quot;.  The disorder may also manifest itself in repetitive<br/>\n&gt; speech.  Disruption of expected spacial or chronological patterns may<br/>\n&gt; express itself symptomatically in irritability, expressions of anger,<br/>\n&gt; difficulty in focusing and other attention deficits, and, in some<br/>\n&gt; cases,<br/>\n&gt; may result in the patient choosing to self-medicate, usually with<br/>\n&gt; alcohol, tobacco, or the illicit use of prescription drugs.<br/>\n&gt; 5.  The patient believes that  most effective learning takes place<br/>\n&gt; within his/her own highly controlled environment, with strict grouping<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; of human beings according to chronological age, and reduced contact<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; other human activity taking place outside the small indoor cubic space<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; to which s/he is confined.<br/>\n&gt; 6.  The patient has grandiose opinions regarding the importance of the<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; activity in which s/he is engaged, regardless of the opinions of those<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; around her/him as expressed in financial remuneration or social<br/>\n&gt; status.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Treatment:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; EEDD and ADTD are difficult to treat effectively, especially as Stage<br/>\n&gt; 2<br/>\n&gt; and 3 of the disorder are often accompanied by denial.  It is<br/>\n&gt; important<br/>\n&gt; to recognize both EEDD and ADTD as diseases, and to treat them<br/>\n&gt; accordingly.  Pharmacological interventions are under development.  It<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; is recommended that the patient be removed from the environment where<br/>\n&gt; symptoms manifest themselves, preferably for the long term.  Group<br/>\n&gt; therapy and self-help groups such as EA (Educators Anonymous) have<br/>\n&gt; shown<br/>\n&gt; promise.  Large amounts of outdoor exposure during daytime hours are<br/>\n&gt; recommended.  It is also highly recommended that exposure to children<br/>\n&gt; during recovery be highly controlled, and limited to recreational<br/>\n&gt; activities.  Once symptoms are under control, patients should be<br/>\n&gt; encouraged to engage in therapeutic learning activities, preferably<br/>\n&gt; those which may have been denied to them in their own childhood.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (I am very interested in hearing from people on these lists who are in<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; recovery from EEDD and/or ADTD -- I am hoping to work on a book about<br/>\n&gt; schoolteachers or former teachers who have chosen to homeschool their<br/>\n&gt; own children -- you can find more info. on my website --<br/>\n&gt; www.skylarksings.com  under &quot;Other Projects&quot;.
