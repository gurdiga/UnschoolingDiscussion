Maybe thats why some people don&#39;t let their kids go<br/>\non sleep overs. I would have never thought of something like that. Sick<br/>\nminds&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m having to put this image out of my mind.  I just began to let my<br/>\ndaughter spend the night at a couple of friend&#39;s homes.  I&#39;ve known them<br/>\na very long time and have a good knowledge of how their ethics work BUT I<br/>\nrealize that it&#39;s still a possibility, however remote.  Knowing what has<br/>\nhappened to some friends has made me cautious enough to wait until I<br/>\nthought she was able to stand her ground.  Actually, I let her tell me<br/>\nwhen she was ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trusting in my discernment as well as my daughter&#39;s and our open<br/>\ncommunication.  I think at her age the trust and freedom are important. <br/>\nI know the odds are in our favor so I have to make as wise a decision as<br/>\nI can and stop my mind from rambling in the wrong direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
