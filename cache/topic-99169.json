Compulsary age is 8-17, my oldest is 9 and this is our 2nd year to comply. You have to file a notarized affidavit and objectives. My objectives are very open and vague and state as interests the child numerous times.We are required to cover certain subjects in Elementary and Secondary years, and at least 180 days or 900/990 hours. We are to keep a log, a portfolio of samples and have an evaluation at the end of the year. The evaluator signs a letter that you put in your port to give to your district. There is testing in grades 3, 5 and 8. How I comply... I keep my &quot;log&quot; as a list of materials used, I write down websites, books, brochures, maps, cd-roms, games etc. that my son has used. He does generate a few writings here and there and pictures, I keep everything in a folder and then pick out a few to turn in. I do not require him to do anything, he knows the law and he knows if we missed something that we will just do something for the port. That hasn&#39;t happened yet, he has a broad range of interests and activites that could cover any subject. My son is not in a grade so we haven&#39;t tested, they haven&#39;t asked me yet but it&#39;s only our 2nd year. I tried not to be too long so if anyone has a question I&#39;ll try to answer. One more thing, all of the districts are not the same, some are friendly and some cause trouble it&#39;s very scary for some people.<br/>\n  Stephanie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":172750465,"authorName":"b229d655@cs.com","from":"b229d655@...","profile":"robeyboyz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] unschooing and meeting state requirements","postDate":"1096056822","msgId":99781,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzZi4yNGZhYmZlLjJlODVkOWY2QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":99780,"nextInTopic":99783,"prevInTime":99780,"nextInTime":99782,"topicId":99169,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/24/2004 3:35:33 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

This will be <br/>\nour 1st &quot;official&quot; home/unschooling year.  We have always been at home except <br/>\nfor DS&#39;s small stint in daycare while I worked there as well and the same DS <br/>\nwas in Kindergarten last year, which was a pure waste of precious time and <br/>\nenergy.  Our 2 DS&#39;s (6 and 3) are happily home now and learning tons every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in VA, which seems relatively strict.  We sent our Letter of Intent and <br/>\ngot a Letter of Approval.  I have a degree so that was all I really needed <br/>\nthere.  But I did have to provide a list of curriculum stuff that we&#39;d use.  I <br/>\nhave heard others say they will invalidate their results for the SOL&#39;s (I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure how to do that) or take the tests for their kids or they take them <br/>\ntogether and make it fun.  As for being assessed by a certified school teacher and <br/>\nhanding in portfolios, who knows?  I wouldn&#39;t even know where to begin finding a <br/>\nteacher willing to &quot;assess&quot; an unschooled child and find anything positive.  <br/>\nPortfolios of your child&#39;s work or journals made up in &quot;teacher lingo&quot; sounds <br/>\nlong, tedious, and highly &quot;schooly&quot;.  So I don&#39;t know how we&#39;ll meet the VA <br/>\nrequirements.  I have to choose a method, so it will be the testing.  It seems <br/>\nthe least intrusive (we can test at home with CAT and turn in only the Language <br/>\nand Math results) but I don&#39;t know what to do about the actual testing.  I&#39;m <br/>\nnot big on being dishonest with it but I really don&#39;t want him to have to sit <br/>\nand color in little dots for hours at the kitchen table either.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPamela<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"unschooing and meeting state requirements","postDate":"1096054506","msgId":99780,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ2RDY2OUI3LTBFNjAtMTFEOS04NDE4LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwOTI0MTgwODQ4LjUwODUzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwOTAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQwOTI0MTgwODQ4LjUwODUzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwOTAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":99779,"nextInTopic":99781,"prevInTime":99779,"nextInTime":99781,"topicId":99169,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Unschooling in difficult states - we don t want to get too bogged down with details of state laws, here, but I need some information from people who are","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1330332142\">Unschooling in difficult states - we don&#39;t want to get too bogged down <br/>\nwith details of state laws, here, but I need some information from <br/>\npeople who are unschooling in states where regulation would seem to <br/>\nrequire curriculum or other more traditional approaches.
