Adopting the ban on metadiscussions as <br/>\ndescribed in your post would be very good for the list. You have my vote.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if that policy were adopted, your post would have been banned.  You could <br/>\nhave written to Jennifer privately, but it went to 850 people (give or take a <br/>\nhundred, it fluctuates).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we&#39;re discussing people&#39;s seeming intent and the effect of their choice <br/>\nof words, that&#39;s part of the discussion of the validity of their advice.  If <br/>\nI come in and say &quot;I have one child and he&#39;s always loved Calvert curriculum, <br/>\nand he&#39;s smart and I&#39;m smart and so if any of you are smart you&#39;ll use <br/>\nCalvert curriculum,&quot; it would be fine for people to question my logic and my <br/>\nmotives.  It would be kinda goofy if they didn&#39;t.   So that sort of <br/>\nquestioning and request for clarification or documentation or reality check <br/>\nis part of a real discussion.   But discussing discussions in the absence of <br/>\nan actual discussion, THAT is twice-removed from talking about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids get along really well with their friends.  I&#39;m surprised sometimes at <br/>\nhow much they&#39;ll put up with, not because they&#39;re afraid the friends will <br/>\nleave, but just because they&#39;re so confident that relationships will come and <br/>\ngo and those who like them will stick around.  So rather than having the urge <br/>\nto &quot;fix&quot; their friends, they just observe them and apply the information to <br/>\nother later interactions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they WILL defend the peace of a game, or a party, or an outing.
