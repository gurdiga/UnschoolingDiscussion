Us americans can be a crude bunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you really think people see that all blacks are poor? I don&#39;t see it that <br/>\nway. I see that no matter who the person of color is, some people just don&#39;t <br/>\nthink they can be their equal and therefore find a way to degrade and knock <br/>\nthem down. My daughters father is extremely racist and I know just with him <br/>\nand his family, they just don&#39;t see many people other than themselves <br/>\n(Italian Americans) as being &quot;as good&quot;. They feel the same way about <br/>\nhispanics, jews, blacks, asians, it&#39;s really pathetic.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny thing is, the daughter married a cuban and one son married a girl who <br/>\nhas a puerto rican child. Of course, those were the exceptions right? That&#39;s <br/>\ntheir reasoning. Thank God my daugher is nothing like any of them and sees <br/>\nhow stupid they can all be. Of course it causes problems for us every now <br/>\nand then as my daughter doesn&#39;t see color when deciding who to date. I&#39;ve <br/>\nfought with her dad on this one a few times. He&#39;s a moron.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy in laws are also prejudice and my husband is nothing like them. Not sure <br/>\nwhat makes certain families stay with that mentality and others escape it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57162,"nextTopicId":56613}}
