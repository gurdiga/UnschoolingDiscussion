Would be neat to see the statistics on it. <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW I liked most of the teachers in the school.

It was the enviroment that just did not suit him.<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations on your daughters, they sound like they are doing very<br/>\nwell. <br/>\nOne of the biggest changes i&#39;ve noticed with my sons esp the oldest<br/>\nwas , the change of having no peer pressure.
