I&#39;ve have been thinking about this a <br/>\nlot and remembering way back when I first pulled my son out of <br/>\nKindergarten. I took tons of books out and read and it was all I <br/>\nate, slept and breathed. I was unschoolng before I had a name for <br/>\nit. I also new that even though the schools labeled my child he was <br/>\nsmart as a whip and he is my child - So I pulled him out. I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure if I have made the &quot;padigram shift&quot; as of yet but I know I am <br/>\nnot the same person I was two years ago. This list gave me the <br/>\nstrength I needed while I was unschooling in a schooling world and <br/>\ngetting flak from non-believers in homeschooling forget <br/>\nUNSCHOOLING !! I never announced that I was unschooling but people <br/>\nprobed me for questions including my husband LOL................ <br/>\nWell <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m here to say good-bye for a little while. As you know I said I <br/>\nwould be going back to work and I will be training for 10 weeks and <br/>\nthe whole process takes about 9 months total(state job). The hard <br/>\npart is that I don&#39;t know when that call will come and I have to be <br/>\nready !! I know what it takes because my sister works there now and <br/>\nhas seen over time what it takes. I know this has nothing to do with <br/>\nunschooling but................I have made the tough choice of <br/>\nputting my son back in school for this time period. VERY TOUGH <br/>\nCHOICE ! I visited the school (not public) and asked them what they <br/>\ncould do for &quot;US&quot; not what could we do for them since we are paying <br/>\nthem. I told them my son doesn&#39;t read and that I had no ciriculum <br/>\nand that I did not want him to be pushed. We bought all of his <br/>\nuniforms and he is dressed to shoes in it right now and he doesn&#39;t <br/>\neven have school today LOL..... I have different eyes now compared <br/>\nto the older me. I have explained to my son that I want this to be a <br/>\nfun experience and I do not want him to feel any pressure to perform <br/>\nbecause learning is suppose to be FUN. He understands that he is not <br/>\nwhere the other children are and he said to the teacher &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>\nread yet&quot;. The only thing that comforts me in this whole thing is <br/>\nthat the children are not aloud to tease the other children and they <br/>\ndon&#39;t single out children with differences. The school I have chosen <br/>\nwas started by home schoolers so while they may not be &quot;Unschoolers&quot; <br/>\n@ least they are not mainstream schoolers. We are schedued for <br/>\nthe &quot;Live and Learn&quot; conference and I look forward to being there <br/>\nand meeting you all. I trust that my son and I will make it through <br/>\nthis unscathed :)<br/>\nFunny I just looked up the word &quot;unscathed&quot; to make sure my spelling <br/>\nwas correct and guess what word was directly under it &quot;unschooled&quot;<br/>\nMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!<br/>\nSee you all @ the conference :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSonya<br/>\nAttleboro,Mass.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren","from":"Ren &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"late readers","postDate":"1076010754","msgId":90305,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMjA1LjExNTMxNC4yNjU0Mi40OTcwMzhAd2VibWFpbDAxLm55Yy51bnRkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":78765,"nextInTopic":90339,"prevInTime":90304,"nextInTime":90306,"topicId":4197,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"well all of your proffessional unschoolers let me ask you this - How do you know if your child has a problem or if he will end up being just a late reader.

I accept that my children are each unique individuals...with or without real disabilities (I&#39;m coming to hate that word) I am going to honor them for who they are, right now, today.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy awareness of their needs might make me research specific traits, especially if it were causing them frustration or discomfort. Understanding those traits might help me give that child what they need, but labeling them, or pushing them to learn something that may be difficult for that child, would never be the answer.<br/>\nHave you read Anne Ohman&#39;s account of her child? &quot;I am what I am&quot; is a beautifully written article, that sums up exactly why I feel disability labels are not only unecessary in unschooling, but harmful.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can google it, or there&#39;s a link at Sandra&#39;s site.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are going to have real life disabilities that keep them from reading well, or even at all. How would pushing something they can&#39;t do ever help? People can be whole and happy, leading productive lives without reading well!! Truly.<br/>\nIt would have to be a very real and serious problem to prevent them from reading entirely. In that case, focus on the things the child CAN do well. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am amazed at how focused our society is on weaknesses or &quot;disabilities&quot;.

Children in Asian countries learn to eat with <br/>\nchopsticks.  It&#39;s natural for them to do so.  Children here can learn to use a spoon <br/>\nnaturally, by trying it, playing with it and watching others do it.  There are <br/>\nhumans who live where the people around them use neither spoons nor <br/>\nchopsticks.  They can&#39;t learn naturally to use what they&#39;ve never seen.   If one of us <br/>\nwent there, we wouldn&#39;t know how to eat--we would need to watch others and <br/>\ncopy their methods.  It could be something kind of complicated, and it would take <br/>\npractice, or it might be something similar to something we already do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is natural for children to learn their cultures.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Do you think if a child were surrounded with written materials, access to a <br/>\ncomputer, games, all the books you can imagine but never were read to or <br/>\nnever <br/>\nintroduced to or helped sound out words or recognize letters they would still <br/>\nbe able to read those books at some point?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere you come into whether the deaf can learn to read.  They do it all the <br/>\ntime.  It has nothing to do with &quot;sounding out,&quot; it&#39;s associating a pattern <br/>\nwith an object or idea.  Some kids are talented with patterns, and could probably <br/>\nfigure out a LOT!  How else could antiquarians figure out how to read <br/>\nEgyption or Babylonian, if it can&#39;t be figured out from the patterns themselves?  <br/>\n(With Babylonian, they had a good starter clue, with the Rosetta Stone, I think.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It does take someone else I think to at the very least &quot;help&quot; them <br/>\nrecognize <br/>\nthe letter A is an A and so on.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you care whether they call &quot;A&quot; that.  The same symbol is not pronounced <br/>\nthe same way by people who speak different languages right now.

Sending children out in the fields to work because that was more<br/>\nimportant and not having hardly any kind of reading materials available is<br/>\ncertainly not how we talk about out children growing up. It wasn&#39;t something<br/>\nthat happened because a lot of people then didn&#39;t do it. Because there<br/>\nweren&#39;t available resources like there are now. And later on, schools and<br/>\npeople would make fun of others who couldn&#39;t read, which would in turn<br/>\nsquash any kind of spark in that person to want to. Someone here said they<br/>\nknew someone who was actually embarrassed to have someone know they couldn&#39;t<br/>\nread. If there was no taboo about not being able to read no matter what the<br/>\nage, I really have no doubt that even 70 year old people would learn to do<br/>\nit. I do know of stories, not personally, where older individuals did learn<br/>\non their own. Think of a 14 year old child in a loving home looking at a Pat<br/>\nthe Cat book trying to read it.

In retrospect I would totally wait on him now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, the GOOD news for those parents who are fidgeting about this, my son started reading when he discovered he could &quot;get&quot; something for it, ie, he could read the instructions about installing and using his favorite computer programs WITHOUT waiting for mom or dad to &quot;finish up&quot; whatever they were working on at the time! He found a use for reading, and now he reads well above &quot;grade level&quot; (whatever that is).<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of...he is curious as to his own &quot;standing&quot; on &quot;grade level&quot; and would like to check out a vocabulary test. I know there are several on the Net, but can&#39;t remember where.
