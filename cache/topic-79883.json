My MIL brought gifts for each of the children and <br/>\ngrandchildren that were momentos from his life.  She gave each of the girls a carving <br/>\nthier Grandpa had made.  She gave the boys each a hat from his &quot;fishing hat&quot; <br/>\ncollection.  She gave my DH his dad&#39;s wallet.  She gave the other children items <br/>\nlike a favorite book of his or a handerkerchief that he carried.    I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow where she got the idea to give gifts in honor of him on his birthday.. but <br/>\nit was very touching and very meaningful.

I mean I talk about my parents to the kids <br/>\nall the time but Jackson isn&#39;t like that.  I sometimes mention to him that the <br/>\nboys won&#39;t really know anything about his mother because he never mentions her. <br/>\n The &quot;day of the dead&quot; could be a really neat idea to celebrate all those <br/>\npeople in our family that have passed before us and tell stories that the boys <br/>\nwill remember.  Just a thought I had, will have to mention that to Jackson and <br/>\nthe boys and see what they think.<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren","from":"Ren &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Diane&#39;s death day celebration","postDate":"1062688762","msgId":79883,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwOTA0LjA4MTk1My4yNzMxMy4yNzA4MDBAd2VibWFpbDA2Lm55Yy51bnRkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":79886,"prevInTime":79882,"nextInTime":79884,"topicId":79883,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I had meant to comment on your Death Day party last night and forgot to Diane...I think it sounds really cool.
