So I&#39;ll rent the other <br/>\ntwo before long and Kirby and I will probably watch them together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the same as getting a movie they  never heard of and saying &quot;I&#39;d <br/>\nlike for you to watch this with me.&quot;   Once you get going with a shared movie <br/>\nhistory, one will lead naturally to another.  You can go by director, or <br/>\nsubject (submarine movies or westerns) or actor (Holly asked last night what <br/>\nTom Cruise was in, and we couldn&#39;t think of anything offhand that she would <br/>\nhave seen or might like), or time period or place or language (I&#39;ve decided <br/>\nnever to watch a French movie ever again, after Brotherhood of the Wolf and <br/>\nThe Piano Teacher [which nobody should watch ever]).</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57415,"nextTopicId":57417}}
