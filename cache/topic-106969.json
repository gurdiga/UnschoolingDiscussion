We reside in West Virginia, USA. I pulled <br/>\nmy son out of PS in Dec 04. I started the traditional homeschooling <br/>\n(ie- using county books) in Jan- with failure. I know, now, part of <br/>\nit is not taking the time to &#39;deschool&#39;. But the more I looked around <br/>\nat ways people homeschool, I think unschooling might just be up our <br/>\nalley. My son was diagnosed adhd in Kindergarten, repeated 1st grade <br/>\n(due to maturity and at suggestion of his teacher who also was friend <br/>\nof family). He&#39;s been medicated since K. I am still medicating but <br/>\nslowly lowering medication. <br/>\n<br/>\nD has always had anger management issues- especially at come off meds <br/>\ntime. He tends to be destructive and verbally irrate (to put it <br/>\nmildy). A few months ago I came upon an idea to help both of us calm <br/>\ndown in these situations. I said why don&#39;t we try calling a word and <br/>\nwhen that word is called we both have to stop what we are doing and <br/>\nhave a time out. D agreed and we proceeded to look for our word. We <br/>\nhit the childrens&#39; encylopedia. Just turning pages closing our eyes <br/>\nand pointing. We finally found &quot;OUR&quot; word- ZENO - to be precise-<br/>\n &quot;Zeno of Citium (c.340- c.265 BC)- Greek philosppher. He founded the <br/>\nStoic school of philosophy, so named because he taught in the Stoa <br/>\nPoikile (Painted Colonade) market place, Athens. Zeno saw the world <br/>\nas one organic whole and declared that man&#39;s duty was to live in <br/>\npeace and harmony with the rest of nature.&quot; Over the past few months <br/>\nwe have refined our ZENO method. <br/>\n<br/>\n1. Call ZENO<br/>\n2. Turn on Cd with soothing music<br/>\n3. Get our paper, pens, pencils, and art stuff on table<br/>\n4. Whoever called it tells the reason they called it<br/>\n5. Set timer for 5-10 minutes<br/>\n6. Individually write or draw or express our feelings in some manner <br/>\nand tell in some way what &quot;I&quot; could have done differently (we try to <br/>\navoid telling what someone else did or could have done)<br/>\n7. Timer goes off<br/>\n8. Each discusses our feelings<br/>\n9. Each tell what we could have done differently<br/>\n10. That&#39;s it- the anger is gone and we each feel a whole lot better!<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes our days are busy with things that have to be done away <br/>\nfrom home and we can&#39;t always do this method. But I can sure tell you <br/>\nthat it hurts when we can&#39;t and there are bad feelings in the air. I <br/>\njust thought we need to come up with a quick-y zeno method. I&#39;ll talk <br/>\nto D when he wakes up. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to share that method of calming anger.  I am also going <br/>\nto post this at unschooling message board so please forgive me if you <br/>\nrecieve it twice. <br/>\n<br/>\nBe Well,<br/>\nRachel<br/>\nPlease Don&#39;t Take Your Organs to Heaven,<br/>\nHeaven Knows We Need Them Here!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106963,"nextTopicId":106996}}
