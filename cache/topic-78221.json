I have been pretty free with the snacks, they go with dad to the store everyone has a candy bar, special things at the grocery, and they have a little money of their own to buy with.Last week Caitlin dd10 would have spent her 5 dollars on candy, but my mom made me aware of it, and then it suddenly didn&#39;t look right.  UGH!! Now I wish I had shrugged and let her do it.  And the dinner thing, yeesh, and I asked them, I miss dinner together I guess, but they wish to stay out and not break from playing. Sooo Caitlin says well I guess we don&#39;t have any choice *BG* but they do now.  Maybe I will just make dinner later... like 8 or 9    we stay up till all hours anyway, it couldn&#39;t hurt.

Sometimes they <br/>\n  eat one meal a day.  They rarely eat breakfast, I generally like the <br/>\n  idea that people need to eat when hungry and not eat when they aren&#39;t <br/>\n  hungry, and not look at the clock much.  And we never say finish your <br/>\n  food or one more bite or any of that.  We totally unfood, and my kids do <br/>\n  very well.

They might eat candy before <br/>\n  dinner instead of after.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  To be honest, my kids don&#39;t really see foods in categories like good <br/>\n  food/bad food.  They usually get a treat when we go shopping.  Janene&#39;s <br/>\n  favorite treats are grape tomatoes, blueberries, and chocolate.  Lexie <br/>\n  usually goes for broccoli , olives (she likes to try gormet, different <br/>\n  flavors, etc.), and chocolate.

My father recently had a conversation with Lexie, 8, about <br/>\n  how Romans had toilets and indoor plumbing and hot water and baths, etc. <br/>\n  so what happened to them?  I was not only amazed at how much she knew <br/>\n  about history but that she was an equal in the conversation, not a kid <br/>\n  being taught.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mostly we read, go do things, go to museums, have LOTS of conversation <br/>\n  about lots of different things, read, watch tv, and read.  <br/>\n  Joylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I know <br/>\n  that sounds stupid, but I am learning a totally new thing here. <br/>\n<br/>\n  There are no stupid questions. it takes hundreds of exposures to <br/>\n  change thinking and then to conceive of how to put that new <br/>\n  thinking into actual practice. One thing that helped me right away <br/>\n  was to stop asking hypothetical questions and to deal directly <br/>\n  with the real issues my children were offering me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  when I think aobut brushing teeth or bath times, in our house <br/>\n  they just aren&#39;t grounds for battles. I do say &quot;Time to brush our <br/>\n  teeth&quot; to the younger ones (6 and 8) but the older three (11, 14, <br/>\n  16) I never mention it to. We don&#39;t have powr struggles here <br/>\n  because the power struggles in our relationship are mostly gone <br/>\n  now.<br/>\n<br/>\n  These little areas become battle fields, in my experience, when <br/>\n  parents control all different aspects of their children&#39;s lives. Then <br/>\n  arguing over bath taking is just one more front for the battle.<br/>\n<br/>\n  With unschooling, it took me awhile to just let go of my <br/>\n  expectations for all aspects of life. I had to step back and watch <br/>\n  for awhile without suggesting toothbrushing, bath time or math. It <br/>\n  was time to learn what my kids did or didn&#39;t do naturally without <br/>\n  all my cajoling, controlling and prompting.<br/>\n<br/>\n  After several months they&#39;ve grown convinced that I&#39;m not out to <br/>\n  control them and they receive suggestions to me in the same <br/>\n  spirit I receive them from them. We are in a cooperative effort to <br/>\n  help each other. So far, I help them a lot more than they help me <br/>\n  but that makes sense too since I&#39;m the adult with more <br/>\n  experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;If you ask them to do something and they say no, do you just <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  say ok?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; So if they don&#39;t want to eat dinner the moment you have it ready, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  they don&#39;t have to eat right then?  If they decide to eat candy from <br/>\n  the neighborhood children instead then they just do?  I mean <br/>\n  that is what mine are doing LOL, so just throwing this out. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess what it sounds like to me is that your home has a lot of <br/>\n  detox going on. Your kids are wanting to have more say in their <br/>\n  lives because they haven&#39;t had it for so long. So right now they <br/>\n  are finding out if what they see starting to happen is actually real, <br/>\n  not just a facade.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Usually after several months, kids settle down into the routines <br/>\n  of the family (or not) and then it won&#39;t feel as chaotic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; The childrens ages are 17, he&#39;s working and paying restitution <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  for a burglary he did, drinking some with some friends, maybe <br/>\n  some other things... I&#39;m not pleased, any suggestions for this?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wouldn&#39;t be pleased either. Is he getting some help? <br/>\n  Counseling? I&#39;m reading a fabulous book right now called &quot;Yes <br/>\n  Your Teen is Crazy&quot; (the title is based on new brain research that <br/>\n  shows that teen brains are still developping hence the title--it&#39;s <br/>\n  tongue in cheek) by Dr, Michael Bradley. He has great advice for <br/>\n  families with teens who are going through some of what you <br/>\n  shared here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; The 14 ydd is only interested in finding all she can about <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  eminem.  Anyone have anything on that, that I can direct her in. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I have to admit: I&#39;m a closet eminem fan. I don&#39;t always love all <br/>\n  his songs, but I find him to be a really relevant artist and his <br/>\n  songs are not just catchy but insightful. The movie 8 Mile is a <br/>\n  terrific look at how rap is a non-violent release valve for kids who <br/>\n  would otherwise have every reason to act out violently and <br/>\n  criminally. I learned a lot watching that movie and I came to <br/>\n  appreciate rap in a new way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;Do I just throw some workbooks on the table and leave them <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  there for them to do if they want to?  When they were younger we <br/>\n  did no school type activities and I heard them talking and they <br/>\n  were saying they thought I was trying to keep them dumb LOL, <br/>\n  so we picked back up.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  There are some great threads on unschooling math in the <br/>\n  archives. I hope you can find them. The idea isn&#39;t so much to <br/>\n  throw workbooks on the table as it is to allow math to be a <br/>\n  meaningful part of all your lives. One of my sons is running a <br/>\n  cookie business. He&#39;s learned a ton about math through the <br/>\n  cooking, pricing, purchasing, accounting and using a bank <br/>\n  account that goes with it. Another one uses math in his <br/>\n  obessession with yu-gi-oh card games. My oldest uses math in <br/>\n  his computer programming.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Math is a normal part of life. Change how you see it before you try <br/>\n  to figure out how to &quot;get it to your kids.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hope some of that was helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Julie B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

We do not need to keep picking away at their minds to make sure they are learning.  What we need to do, and all we need to do, is bring as much of the world as we can into their lives.  Give children as much help and guidance as they ask for; listen respectfully when they feel like talking; and then get out of the way.

I have been reading here and at RUL, and I have been gathering lots of great information..... My name is Stepheny, I live in N. Fl, have 7 children.  Started hsing when my now 17 y ds was 8.  Took him out of PS started 2nd gr., very relaxed, lots of reading, some forced schooling, until he balked too much.  His sisters and younger brothers never saw the inside of a school which is fine by me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow he really fought me over schooling so much that we just put it all down and said forget it, that was about 4 years ago, funny he still listens when I read aloud, and I only know this by the comments he makes as I&#39;m reading to the other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeres the questions: I notice Sandra, that you said something about Kirby taking the GED cold, are you or could you make him a diploma? From the great unschooling high school of your choice? <br/>\n<br/>\nNow for some more.  I noticed a post on brushing teeth how one child decided he didn&#39;t want to do it at all, (an episode of Ren and Stimpy took care of that here) but do any of you push bath time, or suggest that it may be time to take a bath?  I know that sounds stupid, but I am learning a totally new thing here.  If you ask them to do something and they say no, do you just say ok?  I can see where I am inconsistent in some things, making them do some things by force, other times I let it go, it would probably be better to wait until they just do it on their own.  No mixed messages.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if they don&#39;t want to eat dinner the moment you have it ready, they don&#39;t have to eat right then?  If they decide to eat candy from the neighborhood children instead then they just do?  I mean that is what mine are doing LOL, so just throwing this out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I say you I don&#39;t mean any particular you, please don&#39;t be offended.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe childrens ages are 17, he&#39;s working and paying restitution for a burglary he did, drinking some with some friends, maybe some other things... I&#39;m not pleased, any suggestions for this?<br/>\nThe 14 ydd is only interested in finding all she can about eminem.  Anyone have anything on that, that I can direct her in. <br/>\nThe 12 ydd is going to do alright with this as she is pretty self directed already... has an iguana, and is generally enjoying life right now.<br/>\nThe 10 y dd is following the 12, likes to crochet, reverses some letters and words in her reading, loves books with tapes so she can read along or just listen.<br/>\nThe 9 y ds loves games of all kinds, cartoons, cartoons, games, plays well on the computer, does not enjoy reading but does like being read to.<br/>\nAll are doing some math, but since I am not going to force them anymore I don&#39;t know where that will go.  I know not to worry as you all have said in posts I have read.  Do I just throw some workbooks on the table and leave them there for them to do if they want to?  When they were younger we did no school type activities and I heard them talking and they were saying they thought I was trying to keep them dumb LOL, so we picked back up.  Just some thoughts anyway.  <br/>\n                                  Thanks, Stepheny<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: moonstarshooter <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, August 07, 2003 9:13 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-Discussion] Re: Florida<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Where are you in Florida?<br/>\n  &gt; I do not know any unschoolers here.<br/>\n  &gt; I am in Kissimmee.<br/>\n  &gt; Is there anyone &#39;out there&#39; remotely near me????<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Peace~<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Jennifer<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  I almost posted the same question!
