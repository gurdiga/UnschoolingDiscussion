It<br/>\ncould be another room in the house, outside or at a park, just a walk away<br/>\nfrom the group. I do it in my own home around our family and pass that same<br/>\nrespect on when we&#39;re out with others.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSame here. I think it&#39;s not only respectful of other folks, to remove the distressed child, it&#39;s also more respectful of the child so they can continue the melt down in private.<br/>\nAnd allowing verbal abuse to take place is not an acceptable form of tantrum in my home. Melt downs happen, but I respect myself too much to allow someone to direct all their rage at me. It is possible, I have to believe, to help an intense person direct their rage in healthier ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80223,"nextTopicId":80435}}
