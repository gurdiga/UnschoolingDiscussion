(That&#39;s a joke. <br/>\n I don&#39;t think spinach is a good thing in high doses -- too much vitamin K <br/>\nfor our family&#39;s blood condition.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You&#39;re free to disregard this whole thread and think I&#39;m nuts BTW.

He thinks it&#39;s fun.  And funny.  I have been <br/>\ncursed with a child much like myself.
