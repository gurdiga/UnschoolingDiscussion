I struggle with my own issues<br/>\ndaily.  Luckily, I&#39;m at a place where I can recognize the voice in my head<br/>\n(the one telling me to limit, create rules, become dictator, or knee-jerk<br/>\nrespond) as one I don&#39;t necessarily want to listen to.  The voice remains<br/>\nthere, I can choose to turn down the volume, however &lt;bg&gt;  Even sometimes as<br/>\nthat voice does sneak out of my mouth, I tell the kids &quot;that&#39;s MY issue, not<br/>\nyours, don&#39;t worry about what I just said, here is how we&#39;re gonna handle<br/>\nthis: ________&quot;  Most of the time, I have to make up, right there on the<br/>\nspot, how it is we&#39;re gonna handle the situation without a voice telling me<br/>\nwhat&#39;s right.  Sometimes, and more often now, I hear a replay of the<br/>\nPeaceful Parenting tape I picked up at the conference (Richard telling me to<br/>\nreturn to breathing and Sandra telling me not to choose until my brain has<br/>\ngiven me more than ONE choice).  You can create peace for yourself in the<br/>\nmidst of your chaotic moment ~ go to the corner and breathe, breathe in the<br/>\nJOY you&#39;re giving your children and breathe out your self-judgement.  The<br/>\nmore you practice, the better you&#39;ll get.  You must have a peaceful, quiet<br/>\nplace within YOURSELF to return to in order to refill your *tank* so you can<br/>\nshare peace with your family.  Hold a family meeting when everyone is happy<br/>\nand getting along, set up time for you to get your needs met (request some<br/>\ntime during the day as *quiet time* let the kids fill you in on which times<br/>\nwon&#39;t work because of favorite show conflicts ~ their needs treated as<br/>\nimportant and yours will be too).  We&#39;ve been listening to the tape together<br/>\nin the car... we&#39;ve had great talks about taking *time out* when we&#39;re<br/>\nangry, about practicing what&#39;s important to us, the importance of breathing.<br/>\nNot because they were forced to listen, but because it was there and it was<br/>\ninteresting and it applied to where we are right now.<br/>\nI was also blessed with a copy of &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner&#39;s Mind&quot; which is an<br/>\namazing insight into beginning the journey toward peace. It&#39;s a little book<br/>\nwith great points, perfect to pick up when you&#39;re in need of calm but not<br/>\ncalm enough to focus on breathing (the 35 seconds you have before you say<br/>\nsomething really horrible, run to the corner and open it anywhere and read).<br/>\nThe nominal cost of the tape (check out Sandra&#39;s website for it) and the<br/>\ntrip to the library/used book store to get the book are well worth the<br/>\ninvestment into yourself and your family.<br/>\n<br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nPeace is not the absence of tension ~ MLKjr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.771 / Virus Database: 518 - Release Date: 9-28-2004</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100291,"nextTopicId":100191}}
