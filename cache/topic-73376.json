In fact,  dh insisted we have a<br/>\nface-to-face meeting.  SO the supervisor comes out and actually fixed<br/>\nthe locks in question, for one.  I had thought it through and did tell<br/>\nhim I don&#39;t want that technician again.  I was able to find some<br/>\nspecific behaviors that I could point out.  The primary one being that<br/>\nhe asked if I&#39;m &quot;trying to get him fired&quot;.  And I have actually thought<br/>\nof many more specifics that built up my distrust of him.  (When he was<br/>\nin our basement,  he would *look things over* and ask if I wanted to<br/>\nsell them; he frequently mentions the poor quality of subcontractors<br/>\nused by the builder)  I know it would come down to my word against<br/>\nhis...and the supervisor is very loyal to his employees.  I found myself<br/>\nwishing I had recorded some of these conversations!  But I did insist<br/>\nthat he send a different technician.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of what gets my shorts in a bundle is the attitude even the<br/>\nsupervisor has about &quot;homeschooling, stay at home moms&quot;.  He says in<br/>\nalmost every conversation...well, you&#39;re home all the time.  I have<br/>\nexplained to him that I certainly am Not  and that even if I were, I<br/>\nneed the courtesy of a call to schedule work at the house.  However, I<br/>\nfind I often don&#39;t get my point across because I couch it too &quot;gently&quot;.<br/>\nI asked Joe (dh) later how I did and he said he thought I was too easy<br/>\non him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had been doing so much better in this area last year!  I even got<br/>\ncalled a &quot;hothead&quot; for the first time in my 38 (then) years!  Joe says I<br/>\nneed to maintain some of that &#39;hotheadedness&#39; ...meaning say what I<br/>\nthink and don&#39;t be concerned about how the other people feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have another test of this currently.  Our neighborhood is newly<br/>\nbuild/building and has a Social Committee.  They were haphazardly<br/>\nelecting new officers at the last meeting.  Prior to the meeting several<br/>\nneighbors asked me if I would be an officer.  I said &quot;no&quot;.  When they<br/>\nasked, I explained that I didn&#39;t consider planning social activities to<br/>\nbe an area of talent for me.  To one of them I confided that I do not<br/>\nwant to commit to anything this year.  To one I (who knows about my<br/>\nparents deaths and my exhausting caregiving experience),  I confided<br/>\nthat I consider myself on sabbatical (&quot;year of rest&quot;) for this year.<br/>\nAnd that means my needs and those of my dh and children consume my time.<br/>\nSpecifically, it means I certainly would not make long term commitments,<br/>\nthough I may assist in small ways if it falls into place.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway,   at the meeting, when no one was volunteering,  this neighbor<br/>\nannounces that she has a &#39;package deal&#39; in mind - she will be VP and I<br/>\n(me) will be secretary.  I said no and said I had other commitments for<br/>\nthis year that do not allow time for this.  But these people continue to<br/>\nask me if I&#39;ve &#39;thought about it&#39; and the neighbor seems to think I am<br/>\nthe secretary. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I need to put my position in writing, but have avoided it. I<br/>\nam spending way too much time wondering how pissed the neighbor will be;<br/>\nwill it affect our dd&#39;s (her 5yo) has become friends with my dd.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan ...needs ome communication lessons!<br/>\nPS.
