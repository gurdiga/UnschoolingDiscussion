He knew <br/>\nnothing of unschooling back in those days (WAAAAAY back in the 70&#39;s) <br/>\nbut he was definitely an unschooler at heart. He has always pursued <br/>\ninformation with a passion and reads, investigates, discusses and <br/>\nexplores many, many topics that interest him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral times along the way he&#39;s gotten the &quot;you need to go to <br/>\nschool&quot; lecture. (NOT from employers or potential employers, mind <br/>\nyou, more from well meaning relations.) So he&#39;s attempted and dropped <br/>\nout of community college, university, and trade school at various <br/>\npoints in the past 20 or so years. Each time he went, he felt school <br/>\nwas in no way better or more informative than him doing the research <br/>\non his own. And he was easily able to get, keep and move up in the <br/>\njobs he pursued. His preference is to live his life and learn as he <br/>\ngoes. <br/>\n<br/>\nJon has worked in publishing and computers for the past 20 years. He <br/>\nsupports our family of 4 and never stops learning new things. This <br/>\npast summer we all decided it was time to get out of the corporate <br/>\nworld. We bought a coffee shop and have been happily (and <br/>\nsuccessfully) running it ever since. Some people still asked if Jon <br/>\nwas going to go to school to learn how to run a business. &lt;sigh&gt; He&#39;s <br/>\ndone so much research, and knows so much about marketing, payroll, <br/>\nemployee relations, cooking, design, purchasing, etc. And he&#39;s still <br/>\nlearning. It never stops. That&#39;s being an unschooler. And for Jon, <br/>\nand our family, it&#39;s living a life we have chosen and love.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] losing faith in persuasion & in  myself","postDate":"1071120554","msgId":86054,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwMzEyMTAyMTI4NDAuMDI1ZDhlYzBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGJyOGRybCsyZTZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGJyOGRybCsyZTZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":86039,"nextInTopic":86081,"prevInTime":86053,"nextInTime":86055,"topicId":86036,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
