I talk about peaceful parenting to other people and Frank hears me and nods his head in affirmation.  So I know he is hearing me.  And he sees me trying the different things.  It is obvious.  He is ok with it.  He didn&#39;t like it when I brought the candy home and let them have all they wanted but I just do it anyway and he hasn&#39;t said anything else.  I told him eventually they wouldn&#39;t eat that much of it, and he thought I was crazy but he&#39;s interested in it as much as I am.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut when he tells them something they know they cannot come to me afterwards and try to get it turned around.  They have learned quick who to go to when they want to do something.  And he has this thing about they have to ask they just can&#39;t tell they are going to do something and he always says yes, he just thinks it sounds better to ask for something rather than demand it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if he says something and they look to me sometimes I shrug and we just talk about it later.  He isn&#39;t real demanding though.
