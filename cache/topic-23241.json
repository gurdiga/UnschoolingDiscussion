I am Jewish (very reformed)  When my son was born, it was no question, although my sis-in-law was shocked and disgusted.  I didn&#39;t know anyone that wasn&#39;t circumsized and thought about not doing it, then thought, why not?  3000 years of history and all the men  managed to do just fine with out that foreskin.  I really didn&#39;t want my son standing in the locker room wishing that he looked like the rest of the  guys.  Or like his dad for that matter(who is not jewish).  What about his girl friends and wife?  I don&#39;t know if I would have touched one that wasn&#39;t &quot;cut&quot;.  As far as all of those rituals that you mentioned, especially that statement about the kid cutting off the tip of his penis, you must not have paid any attention to the previous post.  About the loving and gentle ritual.  no body tied down a kid and snipped off the tip of his penis, there is little bleeding!<br/>\n and not much pain.  Less I think than those vacc&#39;s we give them in their thigh.  It is still a tough choise...what would your son do if he weere able to choose?  Oh...what if he wants it done latter in life?  That is much more painful!  I cried at the sound of my son whimpper, but then he stopped and knd of giggled at the face of his grandfather and all was over.   It is a matter of choise and all should be respected for their choise...I am sure that whatever someone chose, it was in what they believed to be in the best intrest of THEIR  child.<br/>\n<br/>\nhava great day!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:athterath@...\">athterath@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Frances said, &quot;. . .It is a Jewish ritual(I don&#39;t consider it <br/>\n&gt;mutilation) In Judaism it is done to symbolize basically signing on <br/>\n&gt;the dotted line in each generation to follow the covenant of God.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I haven&#39;t chimed in on this discussion because others have been <br/>\n&gt;saying, quite well, what I would if I did.
