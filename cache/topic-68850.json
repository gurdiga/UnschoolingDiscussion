I am a married single parent &lt;bg&gt; and I <br/>\ngave up chores and such a long tie ago.  I find my children are much more <br/>\nwilling to help and do things on their own, for their own personal pleasure <br/>\nor the pleasure of being helpful.  Yesterday, Haleigh came in and asked me <br/>\nif I would help HER clean up the kitchen and living room!  The floor was <br/>\nsticky (not uncommon here) and she wanted to sit at the kitchen table and <br/>\ndraw and the living room was hiding behind a mountain of toys and pillows <br/>\nand blankets from movie night the night before.  Of course, I was happy to <br/>\nhelp.  While we were picking up, she told me she noticed how much better we <br/>\nall feel when the house is clean and that she likes cleaning with me because <br/>\nwe always end up talking about cool stuff so it doesn&#39;t even seem like <br/>\ncleaning.  I almost cried. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are days when I feel like my house is consuming me.  Seven kids make a <br/>\nlot of messes and it is easy to feel like all I ever do is play human vacuum <br/>\nraces behind them.    What helped me regain control of the house while <br/>\nmaintaining my sanity was placing wicker laundry baskets around to store kid <br/>\nstuff.  The little kids don&#39;t mind helping when they know they can just toss <br/>\neverything into a basket and go on about their business.  In the evening, I <br/>\njust collect baskets and return the contents to their proper homes.  It <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t take long and it keeps the house manageable during the day without <br/>\nall the wars we used to have.  Before, when I asked them to pick up, they <br/>\nwould carry a toy back to their room and get side-tracked so I was <br/>\nconstantly having to drag them back to task.  How joyous that those days are <br/>\nlong gone and we can finally breath again while keeping the messes contained <br/>\nin the meantime.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\">http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2892732,"authorName":"Lee Roversi","from":"Lee Roversi &lt;ncfarms@...&gt;","profile":"roversi5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"new to group and high schoolers","postDate":"1052865752","msgId":68951,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMuMC41LjMyLjIwMDMwNTEzMTI0MjMyLjAwN2NhNDMwQG1haWwuYWxvaGEubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":68905,"nextInTopic":68958,"prevInTime":68950,"nextInTime":68952,"topicId":68850,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is an interesting discussion to me - especially about housekeeping and such.

I rarely have<br/>\nany issues with my children when I say &quot;Will you give me a hand with<br/>\nfolding this laundry?&quot; or &quot;I need someone to help with getting these<br/>\ngarbage cans to the street.&quot; or &quot;Let&#39;s get these dishes done quickly before<br/>\nwe head to the beach.&quot; even &quot;Do you need me to help you organize your<br/>\nroom?&quot; or &quot;Wanna slice these carrots and potatoes with me?&quot;  The most<br/>\nappropriate and precious talks often follow, while we work side by side.<br/>\nAnd, sometimes, I get the answer of &quot;No, mom, I&#39;m working on this drawing&quot;<br/>\nor whatever. Or - &quot;Can you wait and when I&#39;m done I&#39;ll give you a hand,<br/>\nmom.&quot; Seems reasonable to me. And, if I really reflect, it seems perfectly<br/>\nappropriate that I do the bulk of the household work around here . . . I am<br/>\nthe one with the often insanely high standards. We have no assigned chores<br/>\nand it all gets done and usually with good humor. I&#39;m a single mom with<br/>\nthree kids at home (19, 16 and 12) and three home businesses. I really like<br/>\nto preserve our relationships - WAY MORE important to me than any power<br/>\nstruggles. I am deeply grateful that my kids want to be with me, talk with<br/>\nme, work with me. Even though somedays it all seems to be too much. I<br/>\nprefer that to the alternatives I see around me all the time . .  .parents<br/>\nwho can&#39;t wait for school to start again after the summer, or kids who<br/>\nwould rather be anywhere than with their parents. How lucky I feel to walk<br/>\nout of a movie theater with a teen holding each hand, babbling about the<br/>\nmovie together - and how sad to see other teens slinking to the cars<br/>\noutside, hoping no one will see their parents waiting. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy thoughts for the day, on a misty rainy spring day on Kauai from a mother<br/>\nwho has just been reminded how fortunate she really is!<br/>\n<br/>\nAloha, Lee<br/>\nNorth Country Farms<br/>\nAn Eco-Tourism Destination<br/>\nP.O.

A need they have for themselves. We don&#39;t<br/>\nalways have to understand why the children choose what they do. But giving<br/>\nthem the freedom to do so is what is important. It won&#39;t last forever.<br/>\nReally it won&#39;t. I have seen and heard the Wizard of Oz so much for the last<br/>\n2 weeks I have munchkins in my dreams. I don&#39;t get the why of wanting it on<br/>\nso much, but it makes Alyssa happy and there&#39;s something she&#39;s getting from<br/>\nit. I don&#39;t expect her to be watching it twice a day when she&#39;s 18. She&#39;s<br/>\nalready moved on to Snoopy!!<br/>\nYour kids just sound like they haven&#39;t had enough time to do everything they<br/>\nwant for as long as they want. Even if that&#39;s not &quot;enough&quot; for you. It<br/>\nobviously is for them. And that&#39;s what unschooling is all about. Trusting<br/>\nthem to know what and how much they need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;When they do go they usually end up enjoying the time and or learning<br/>\nsomething new...when they go it is to a field trip most times, I do not make<br/>\nthem go usually to the playground days unless we have an errand to run<br/>\nbefore or after that they need to be there for..&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre they responsible enough that you would feel comfortable leaving them<br/>\nhome alone? Even if you say they usually have fun and learn, maybe they are<br/>\njust great kids who make the most our a situtaion they have no choice in.<br/>\nBut, maybe at their age, they would really like to be home alone if even for<br/>\nan hour. They like it and a lot of kids need it. My 17  year old loves when<br/>\nwe all leave the house and she doesn&#39;t have anywhere to go. She doesn&#39;t<br/>\nthrow big parties or drink or smoke. She stays home alone with the stereo<br/>\nblasting (something she doesn&#39;t do when people are here) and dances around<br/>\nnaked (another thing she doesn&#39;t get to do) and sings her guts out.<br/>\n(something we have all been unfortunate enough to hear!!!) Those times when<br/>\nshe gets to play house all by herself and when she gets to play grown up<br/>\nwith her friends away on a trip are enough for her now. Her having the<br/>\nfreedom to do it makes her not in any hurry at all to leave home. And<br/>\nremember, learning to our children doesn&#39;t always look like learning to us.<br/>\nTo unschool, you need to throw that &quot;learning&quot; attitude out the window. The<br/>\nkids are learning in ways you don&#39;t realize.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I have tried this to no avail....I am personally tired of trying to find<br/>\nthings that interest them...there is an excuse for every thing we suggest.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you asked them what they would like to do or just suggest and set<br/>\nthings up? If they don&#39;t give you an answer, maybe it&#39;s because they just<br/>\ndon&#39;t know yet. They&#39;re not sure what would interest them aside form the<br/>\ncomputer and games. For right now, it IS the computer and games. Let them do<br/>\nthat until their wants and needs take them elsewhere. And it may still be<br/>\ncomputer and games but in a different way. You have to realize that now if<br/>\nyou really want to unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Such as?  The kitchen will not clean itself and I am not able to clean our<br/>\nwhole house myself physically (I have some medical issues), nor should I<br/>\nhave too, these kids live here too and they should care about their home and<br/>\nhow it looks (this is a problem for our 14 yr old as well when it comes to<br/>\nher room, which she shares with her lil sister...should her lil sister have<br/>\nto deal with the pigsty??  nothing works in getting the older one to clean<br/>\nup her crap, so the lil on some days can not even walk into their<br/>\nroom)....the kitchen is the only real chores these kids have other then<br/>\noccasional things I ask them to do and their rooms.  I have zero problems<br/>\nwith my younger ones about chores or finding things to do. I am here 24/7<br/>\nother then about 4 nights a month when I work the midnights shift...not<br/>\nenough to make a difference in my opinion.  I do not feel I was put on this<br/>\nearth to be these teenagers maid and that is what I feel like some<br/>\ndays...after cleaning all day I am physically exhausted and have no energy<br/>\nto play/do things with the lil kids....so then they suffer because the older<br/>\nkids would not help with keeping the house in a livable manner, even though<br/>\nthe lil kids did do their jobs.  So in the end 3 people suffer because 2 did<br/>\nnot do their part...that is my dilemma.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course your children live there too but they obviously don&#39;t have the<br/>\nsame wants when it comes to how YOU think the house should look. You need to<br/>\nfind another way to talk with them and let them know what&#39;s important to YOU<br/>\nin how the house looks. Not them. If it&#39;s a matter of sharing a room, make a<br/>\ndeal with her so she can keep her side the way SHE wants it and ask if she<br/>\ncould please allow a path and some room for sister to play. There has to be<br/>\na way to divide the room and allow her the freedom to keep her stuff the way<br/>\nSHE wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you mentioned that you were not put here to be a maid to the teenagers,<br/>\nI immediately thought that the teenagers probably feel that way too. They<br/>\ndidn&#39;t ask to be here and clean a house that they don&#39;t see as dirty and<br/>\nmessy. YOU see it that way. You should try and look at things in a different<br/>\nway from what you are accustomed to. Maybe even loosen up on some things and<br/>\nmake compromises all around. Like let them have their room messy and maybe<br/>\nanother family room or something in the house where they hang out but ask if<br/>\nthey can help out keeping the &quot;whole family&quot; rooms a bit neater. At the same<br/>\ntime maybe you can ease up on what you think is necessary. You have to find<br/>\na way to talk to them so they listen and understand where YOU are coming<br/>\nfrom. At the same time, you need to understand where they are coming from in<br/>\nwhat&#39;s important to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] new to group and high schoolers","postDate":"1052846610","msgId":68900,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlLjExMzFjNTM0LjJiZjI4NDEyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":68888,"nextInTopic":68905,"prevInTime":68899,"nextInTime":68901,"topicId":68850,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/13/03 10:30:57 AM, becqui@comcast.net writes:  Such as please go and read the discussions I mentioned, because I don t want","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-692701398\">In a message dated 5/13/03 10:30:57 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:becqui@...\">becqui@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; <br/>\nSuch as?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch as please go and read the discussions I mentioned, because I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto try to reconstruct them here.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;pigsty??  nothing works in getting the older one to clean<br/>\nup her crap,&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPigsty and crap are not the kinds of words I use about my children or their <br/>\nthings.<br/>\nThe negativity is more harmful than hours of video games and worse than any <br/>\namount of messy stuff in their rooms.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I do not feel I was put on this<br/>\nearth to be these teenagers maid and that is what I feel like some<br/>\ndays..&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWere they put on this earth to clean your house?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou had way more say in them getting here than anyone else.
