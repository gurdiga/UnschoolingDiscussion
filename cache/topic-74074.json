Only THEN","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1495663670\">I just have to say....for all the time I spent &quot;getting to&quot; unschooling was worth it, the best part was when I actually just did it (fears and all).  Only THEN is when you actually get the confidence to continue.  I was lucky that I had one child who had never been formally schooled.  She was my example and my inspiration to let the other two alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe change is absolutely amazing...and its not just a change in perception on my part because I&#39;ve changed some of my expectations.  The kids are really changing &quot;who they are&quot;.  They are taking active interests in things of their own choosing.  They are becoming such responsible young adults (well except for some of the usual immature friend stuff I&#39;ve already posted about).<br/>\n<br/>\nI could see the difference today when we went to a restaurant with two other kids.  The owner made it pretty clear that she saw a difference without actually saying so.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently I started giving them an allowance each week.  There are no real strings attatched other than it would be nice if they would help me out with stuff...no requirements, just a general request.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I am now giving them each an allowance, I do not have extra money to &quot;stretch&quot; to buy &quot;extra&quot; stuff for them.  That is what the allowance is for. And I am VERY happy to say that they are MUCH more content with generic stuff now that it is *their* money they are spending :o).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe no longer have to go the mall, the Dollar Store will do just fine.  My daughter just bought a pair of sandals at the Dollar STore today.  No more &quot;pigging out&quot; at a restaurant when we could have eaten lunch at home.  &quot;Just ice cream&quot; is enough so they have their money for other stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey just seem so much more content in general (except where the friend issues are concerned, but I&#39;m expecting that to improve in the next few weeks as we get more involved in other things).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this week was such a treat for me.  NO SPORTS!  I was able to just relax, go for evening walks with my dog, and sit at the pool or swim if I wanted to.  No rushing around.  It was *almost* a vacation!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, anyway...Just wanted to share :O).<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73465,"nextTopicId":73677}}
