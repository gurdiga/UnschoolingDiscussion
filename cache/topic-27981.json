We knew there wasn&#39;t much<br/>\nchance of seeing the meteor shower.  We laid on a tarp, wrapped in<br/>\nsleeping bags, my son&#39;s little warm hand in mine.  While we were hoping<br/>\nfor the clouds to break,  we began to hear the geese.  They came over our<br/>\nlittle town in waves,  their bellies shimmering like silver ribbons<br/>\nagainst the grey sky.  The sound was indescribable.   I can&#39;t begin to<br/>\nimagine how many there were.  When our hot chocolate ran out and my son<br/>\nfell asleep, we carried him inside.  We went out again about two o&#39;clock<br/>\nand still the geese were coming.  We watched and listened for two more<br/>\nhours, before their numbers seemed to dwindle.  It was all so utterly<br/>\nmagical.   Not one shooting star but thousands of shining geese, and they<br/>\nsang to us too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Diane","from":"Diane &lt;cen46624@...&gt;","profile":"dwesner123","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"eLNx6q6tuuoo7Ui9iXaO3UAdjf0e84ApBrX91SiZuuJWaQZk6zy0PO0U6VKiiyCy-gd4Y5I252Dk7J4Rh0zFgv2I9e5Mo-Y","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"How&#39;s the weather?","postDate":"1006138743","msgId":27981,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNCRjg3NTc3Ljk4N0FBRkZBQGN5YmVydHJhaWxzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PHAwNTAwMTk1NGI4MWRiODVjNWQ5N0BbMjA4LjI2LjIzNS4xXT4gPDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAxMTExODE0MjUxMy4wMGEyMWM1MEBwb3AuaXNsYW5kbmV0LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":27999,"prevInTime":27980,"nextInTime":27982,"topicId":27981,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here in Tucson it s still warmer than I d like, but we ve had a couple of days where we could break out the long pants.
