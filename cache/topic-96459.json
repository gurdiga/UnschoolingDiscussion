I would verbally stop her<br/>\nmany times during the day, and she took to hiding to do it.  And she would<br/>\ndo it at night.  Also, she sometimes seemed to be doing it to get my<br/>\nattention.  Then, one day in the car, I looked in the rear view mirror and<br/>\nsaw her biting her nails.  She saw me &quot;see&quot; her.  For some reason, I decided<br/>\nto do nothing.  I didn&#39;t say a word, but went back to driving along and<br/>\nhumming the song I was humming.  Well, this was just too much for her!  She<br/>\nstarted doing it more vigorously when she saw me glance back at her.  Then<br/>\nshe said, &quot;Mommy, didn&#39;t you see me biting my nails?&quot;  I said, &quot;MmmHmmm...I<br/>\ndid.&quot; Really matter of factly.

But a few<br/>\ndays later I noticed her hands and her nails had obviously not been chewed<br/>\nin awhile.

I<br/>\nused to bite my nails, but now only do so if one of them is cracked and<br/>\ncatching on stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI�m about to Google nail biting.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts, either on the nail biting, or ways of ending the conflict? I�m<br/>\nsure I am missing something really obvious. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
