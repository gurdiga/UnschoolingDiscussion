I praticed at church and in club meetings and I wtched to see which <br/>\nadults did it really well.<br/>\n<br/>\nPete Domenici.  Senator from New Mexico.  I&#39;ve been to two social events of <br/>\nhis close family.  A LLL leader friend of mine married his son and I did the <br/>\nwedding music, and then Keith and I played  Hogwarts teachers for a surprise <br/>\nHarry Potter party for his teenaged grandson.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth times, he impressed the heck out of me with his social  skills.  And <br/>\nthink how easy we were after international diplomacy situations! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nToday there was an open house at Honeywell, where Keith works.  It was the <br/>\nfirst one since Holly was little, and we had fun.  One of the vice presidents <br/>\nwas in the dunking tank when we were leaving.  If adults missed their three <br/>\nballs, they were done.  If kids missed, the woman running the game sent them to <br/>\npush the switch, so pretty much he was getting dunked every minute or two for <br/>\nhalf an hour.   He was probably not 40, maybe early 30&#39;s.  Keith said he&#39;s <br/>\nmanagement because he has the skills to do that job--he remembers everyone&#39;s name <br/>\nhe&#39;s ever met, and is more business minded than engineering minded.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we think kids need math and science but we don&#39;t think of how much <br/>\nnurturing their existing talents with other people could help them out in the <br/>\nworld!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76512,"nextTopicId":76526}}
