(Another kind of intro.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBenefits of Video Games for Unschoolers [02 26]<br/>\n<br/>\nPanel: (standing and walking around, not sitting, but the sound quality is <br/>\nAMAZINGLY good!)<br/>\nSandra Dodd, Dan Vilter and Kathy Ward,<br/>\nPlus one child of each:  Jonathan Ward who was 18 I think, Matthew Vilter who <br/>\nwas 12, and Holly Dodd, who was 10, who were demonstrating games (Dan had set <br/>\nup a big projection screen) and describing what they were doing.<br/>\n    (After all that Intro, I find I only have one copy left of this one.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo Question, or Not to Question—That is the Question  [01- ? at least tell <br/>\nhim it was 2001]<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Richard Prystowsky, (editor of Paths of Learning magazine), I was <br/>\ndiscussing how a parent whose family of origin did NOT encourage question-asking, <br/>\nwhose parents tended to shush them, can learn to enjoy and encourage <br/>\nquestion-and-answer dialogs, and how wonderful that is for unschoolers.  The underlying <br/>\ntheme was whether Jewish childrearing tradition has some principles that <br/>\nChristian families could greatly benefit from knowing.  I was raised Baptist, <br/>\nRichard was raised Jewish, and we’re both now Buddhist-esque, though Richard much <br/>\nmore than I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeaceful Parenting  [02 36]<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso with Richard Prystowsky.<br/>\nThis is the tape more people have bought than all the others combined.  We’re <br/>\ndiscussing practical ways to make family life more peaceful.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I charge $7.50 to mail one from here, and I take paypal, and if other list <br/>\nowners see me selling something on the list they  might throw me off or put me <br/>\non moderation so I hid it at the bottom.
