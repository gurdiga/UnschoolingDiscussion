This person showed up in our lives last summer when she moved into the neighborhood, but has only begun to be a problem since this fall. It just built slowly...a favor here, a favor there..something else there, another thing there...<br/>\n <br/>\nYes, I&#39;m HSing legally; but if DSS thinks I&#39;m overwhelmed or anything they can petition for legal custody and put them all in school/daycare even if they don&#39;t remove the children. Not that they WILL necessarily, but that they COULD. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe only thing I&#39;m really needing to do with Megan (and all of them), I think, is be home and playing more than on the road helping out someone else. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m trying really hard not to beat myself up right now...I&#39;m back on Paxil for PPD by the way if that also helps anyone to understand all of this mess that once was my life. But I wanted to meet people, and I&#39;ve managed to only meet people who aren&#39;t really doing us any good. One is a major drain on us, and one isn&#39;t so much a drain as just..well, she&#39;s a drain in a couple different ways although she does reciprocate with things and truly enjoys my children and doesn&#39;t disparage the way I&#39;m raising them......we have more of a real friendship but here lately because of this other person I haven&#39;t even had time to say hello to this friend! <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, Susan, thanks for your kind words. I do know you from another list or two, and it&#39;s good to see you here. <br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not?!<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
