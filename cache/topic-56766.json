But, I think that no matter how much they say it <br/>\namong themselves.. when they get called the N word by a white person, its <br/>\npainful.   And, yes, its shameful.   My dilema was trying to explain to my <br/>\nchildren that it was OK for black people to say it, but not for white people. <br/>\n They had never heard it in a negative  way.  They had never heard a white <br/>\nperson call a  black person the N word out of hate or prejudice.  To JP.. <br/>\n&quot;Nigger&quot; was an term, like &quot;buddy&quot;, &quot;homey&quot;  .. I really had to stress to him <br/>\nthat it was not nice.. it was downright ugly, hateful, when used by white <br/>\nfolks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56391,"nextTopicId":56405}}
