His only exposure in recent years occurred when an item<br/>\ncontained peanuts that wasn&#39;t supposed to.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few years ago, the 6yo -- I can&#39;t remember if she was 2 or 3, but I&#39;m sure<br/>\nshe was in the 2.5-to-3.5 range -- chose to eat some chocolate that grandma<br/>\nhad sent that contained walnuts. I mentioned to her that it contained<br/>\nwalnuts and that she would likely have some problems with it. She chose to<br/>\neat the candy (and a lot of it) anyway. In the past she had had mild<br/>\nreactions to a small taste of nuts. This time, her reaction was rather<br/>\nintense. It went away with Benadryl, though. (My son with the peanut problem<br/>\nhas a more intense reaction that Benadryl doesn&#39;t stop.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo this day, nearly 4 years later, she has not eaten any kind of tree nut,<br/>\neven accidentally -- she can tell by the smell if something would be a<br/>\nproblem. <br/>\n<br/>\nI carry Benadryl and my son has an Epi-Pen, just in case -- but they have<br/>\ndone an excellent job on their own in avoiding the allergens. I admit I was<br/>\nable to allow the daughter to eat the walnuts before I knew all the<br/>\npotential consequences. Food just doesn&#39;t become a big issue in my house,<br/>\nand I&#39;m glad because it was always a big issue for me. I struggle with my<br/>\nweight while my kids are fit and lean and make healthy choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a short time, I kept peanut butter out of the house. It has returned,<br/>\nhowever. It&#39;s one of my 6yo&#39;s favorite foods, and I didn&#39;t want her to have<br/>\nto suffer. We know to be careful.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease understand that in sharing about my kids being able to monitor their<br/>\nown consumption of hazardous (for them!) foods at a young age I have no<br/>\nmisconceptions that I am anywhere near where I want to be in our unschooling<br/>\njourney. I expect to learn a lot more than I can contribute.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen<br/>\nin Culver City, CA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104890,"nextTopicId":104776}}
