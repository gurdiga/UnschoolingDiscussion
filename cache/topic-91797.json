If you are using a sling, make sure the sling is spread wide across your back for the best support.  I never felt comfortable in any other type of carrier.  I have mid-back problems due to large breasts and for both my dd&#39;s had to stop carrying all the time when they reached about 17lbs regardless of their age, while I have friends who continued to use the sling through the fourth year with their kids.  What i did when a child wanted to be picked up is to stop what i was doing, sit down and hold them.  I couldn&#39;t continue to carry the children and their need was to be held.  So i held them.  Once the need was fulfilled, they would move on and i could get back to whatever, cooking, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the bed, we have two queen sized beds next to each other.  Wall to wall bed.  This helps with restless sleepers.  And the movement tended to reduce as the kids got older.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa H.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77662315,"authorName":"arcarpenter2003","from":"&quot;arcarpenter2003&quot; &lt;arcarpenter@...&gt;","profile":"arcarpenter2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"OT:  Good attachment parenting lists?","postDate":"1079071338","msgId":91797,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMycmpwYStzbXBpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":91800,"prevInTime":91796,"nextInTime":91798,"topicId":91797,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I searched Yahoo!
