The attitude of public schools (and their rules)<br/>\nsays that children of a certain age belong in certain classes, regardless of<br/>\nwhat they know and/or can do. Thus, as we&#39;ve read on this list, and often<br/>\nhear from callers, children who are ahead of their age-mates are punished by<br/>\nbeing made to sit through classes that bore them, and kids who are behind<br/>\nare treated badly for that. In fact, hardly anbody fits the mould well.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren who will be going to school at age five are guided into that<br/>\nexperience by NOT being allowed to learn too much OR too little, but just<br/>\nthe right amount so that they&#39;ll fit into the school mould. Good readers are<br/>\nnot wanted in kindergarten classes, or even in first or second grade. The<br/>\nschools normally have no way to deal with child who is advanced beyond the<br/>\nclass. Who suffers? The child. If a kid wants to do something that&#39;s not on<br/>\nthe school menu, forget it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd pre-school is designed to prepare kids for kindergarten, not to allow,<br/>\nor even less encourage, them to investigate their real intelligence.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, Children whose parents plan to unschool grow up differently. The<br/>\nparents turn the child loose to advance at his/her own pace in any area that<br/>\ninterests the kid. There&#39;s no reason to hold them back, and homeschoolers<br/>\nknow that schools do not often offer opportunities to express their true<br/>\nintelligence, because the goal is not high achievement, but mediocrity -- a<br/>\nlarge mass of middle-achievers. There are exceptions, but they&#39;re rare, and<br/>\nthey exist usually because a teacher is breaking the rules, and the schools<br/>\ndon&#39;t look kindly on such &quot;creative&quot; people.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40975,"nextTopicId":40977}}
