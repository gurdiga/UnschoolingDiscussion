Let me take this opportunity to thank<br/>\nyou all for contributing to my project to help families in southeast India<br/>\nbuild their own cyclone-proof housing under the auspices of Land for the<br/>\nTillers Freedom (LAFTI), which was founded by my mother and father<br/>\nKrishnamal and S. Jagannathan.<br/>\n<br/>\nI called them on the third day of Pongal (South Indian Thanksgiving) to<br/>\nannounce that we had raised all the necessary funds for the brickmaking<br/>\nmachine.  My brother, a psychiatrist working with children of war victims in<br/>\nCambodia but home for the holidays said that they were ready and planned to<br/>\nbuild 8,000 houses in three years.  My mother, standing in the background,<br/>\nyelled into the telephone �Two years!�  This will really be a dream come<br/>\ntrue for 11,000 families who, even twenty years ago, could not have even<br/>\ndreamed of eating three square meals a day, no less owning their own land,<br/>\nstarting cottage industries, or having real roofs over their heads.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore good news: with funds raised from sales of my book (�And the Skylark<br/>\nSings with Me� � visit my website at www.skylarksings.com for more<br/>\ninformation � credit card orders now accepted), I was able to purchase two<br/>\nused portable computers for LAFTI�s  offices.  This will enable the foster<br/>\nkids to communicate with their supporting families (who are mostly in<br/>\nItaly), for LAFTI to communicate with funders and supporters more<br/>\neffectively, and my father to stay in touch with ecological organizations<br/>\nand developments around the world.  A friend from my Quaker meeting was kind<br/>\nenough to transport the computers, which should have arrived today.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now for the biggest news of all: on Wednesday, I received an e-mail from<br/>\nSweden, informing me that Krishnamal and S. Jagannathan had been nominated<br/>\nfor the Year 2000 International Right Livelihood Award.  The Right<br/>\nLivelihood Award is best known as the �Alternative Nobel Peace Prize�, and<br/>\nis given to individuals and groups �offering practical and exemplary answers<br/>\nto the crucial problems facing the world today.� It is awarded at ceremony<br/>\nbefore the Swedish Parliament the day before the Nobel Prize presentations.<br/>\nA list of previous winners since 1980 reads like a who�s who of the best of<br/>\necology, community development, human rights, peace, and justice programs<br/>\nworldwide.  (To read more about the Award, visit www.rightlivelihood.se)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe e-mail I received from the Director, Kerstin Bennett, specifically<br/>\nsolicited letters of support.  So I invite those who know of the efforts of<br/>\nmy parents and LAFTI to please write to the Awards Administrative Office.<br/>\nThey said they prefer to receive letters by mail.  Send to: International<br/>\nJurors, Right Livelihood Award, c/o Kerstin Bennett, Administrative<br/>\nDirector, Administrative Office, PO Box 15072, S-104 65 Stockholm, Sweden.<br/>\nIf you can�t write a letter, an e-mail will do: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:info@...\">info@...</a><br/>\nEnclosed you will find a sample letter which I hope you can improve on.  And<br/>\nif you can�t see your way to writing your own letter, I hope you will<br/>\nconsider signing and sending this one along.  (P.S. -- just ask, and I&#39;ll<br/>\nforward the letter to you in WORD.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again to all of you for making this best 50th birthday celebration<br/>\nI�ve ever had! (I can�t wait for the next one!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid H. Albert<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(P.S. Tax-deductible donations to the Gandhian Foundation are still being<br/>\naccepted and will be used for purchase more tools needed in the<br/>\nhousebuilding program.  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n February 20, 2000<br/>\n<br/>\nInternational Jurors<br/>\nRight Livelihood Award<br/>\nc/o Kerstin Bennett � Administrative Director<br/>\nPO Box 15072<br/>\nS-104 65 Stockholm<br/>\nSweden<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Distinguished Jurors:<br/>\n<br/>\nI am writing to you to support the nomination of S. and Krishnamal<br/>\nJagannathan and the Land for the Tillers Freedom (LAFTI) organization to<br/>\nreceive the Year 2000 Right Livelihood Award.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe work of the Jagannathans on behalf of the poorest of the poor people of<br/>\nSouth India now spans some six decades.  Through their tireless efforts,<br/>\nthousands of families � many of whom were landless for up to forty<br/>\ngenerations � now are able to own and till their own land, provide for their<br/>\nfamilies, and build strong, vibrant communities. And they can do so not as a<br/>\nresult of government largesse or large scale international assistance, but<br/>\nthrough their own labor.  The Jagannathans have returned to the people<br/>\nthemselves a sense of their own power and the responsibility that comes with<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Jagannathans are a living example of what it means to do more with<br/>\nless.  They have, with the support of their communities but without any<br/>\ninstitutional or organizational backing, confronted major ecological<br/>\ndevastation caused by multinational corporations and assisted by<br/>\ngovernmental indifference, and in the face of overwhelming odds, have<br/>\nprevailed.  In doing so, they have educated their communities on the<br/>\nimportance of being forever vigilant, and the power of committed communities<br/>\nwilling to stand together and, harnessing the power of nonviolent action,<br/>\nconfronting obstacles in the path of sustainability.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you know, LAFTI was literally formed out of ashes � the deliberate<br/>\nburning to death of 43 women and children who were rounded up and locked in<br/>\na house which was then set afire in the village of Killevanmani in 1968. To<br/>\nthis day, Krishnamal Jagannathan says she carries the light of those 43<br/>\nwomen and children in her heart, and sees this light growing stronger in the<br/>\nfaces of the thousands of children who now know a freedom they never would<br/>\nhave imagined even a generation ago.  In honoring the Jagannathans, who are<br/>\nnow in the 90s and 70s respectively and still going strong, the Right<br/>\nLivelihood Award would be honoring the memory of these women and children,<br/>\nand help the flame of human rights, justice, and community and ecological<br/>\nsustainability blaze ever so much more brightly, both for their descendants<br/>\nand for generations to come<br/>\n<br/>\nI do hope you will give this nomination the most careful and favorable<br/>\ndeliberation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely yours,</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6432,"nextTopicId":6459}}
