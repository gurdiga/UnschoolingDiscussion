Never held hands for anything but sefety<br/>\nand an adults need to hurry you along.  Because those things have been<br/>\ndiscussed.  I was thinking more about those who do snuggle, tussle, tickle,<br/>\nand tease.  With all that physical contact in relaxation and play are we<br/>\nteaching our children how to touch others?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Alowing them a greater comfort zone and mastery of basic touch skills.<br/>\n(Like one of my kids learned today if you lean your pointy chin on a womans<br/>\nbreast she may find it painfull, as a breast isn&#39;t a fatty mass but full of<br/>\nsensitive mammery glands.)  Hmmm.  going to have to think about &#39;mastering<br/>\nbasic touch&#39; a bit more.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI find this topic very interesting.  I too think there must be a sexual<br/>\nintelligence.    <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the topic of touch though.  I have two children.  My oldest (11) is<br/>\na lot like her dad in many ways.  My youngest (9) is more like me. (from<br/>\nlooks to personality with both of them) I enjoy touch/snuggles more than my<br/>\ndh.  My dh doesn&#39;t seem to need as much touch as I do and my older dd is<br/>\nlike that too.  She likes to be close and even still sits on my lap often,<br/>\nbut she doesn&#39;t ask for back rubs and snuggles and kisses like my younger dd<br/>\ndoes.  Snuggling with my younger dd really makes her shine.  It is obvious<br/>\nwhen she needs a dose of love in that way.  The connection that my older dd<br/>\nneeds when she is down is more of a listening ear rather than touch so much.<br/>\nOf course, they both need a listening ear and they both need touch, but it&#39;s<br/>\nvery obvious that there is a difference in their needs.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThat need/lack of need for touch between my dh and I does play a role in our<br/>\nsexual relationship too.  Not sure I want to go into that here though.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":113001,"nextTopicId":113026}}
