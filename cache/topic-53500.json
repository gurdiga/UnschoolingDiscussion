You can learn more about me at my website: www.brandiland.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We started the kids in a head start type program the last semester<br/>\n&gt; of last school year.  I regret ever having introduced them to the<br/>\n&gt; school system because now it is *impossible* to unteach them the<br/>\n&gt; behaviors that they have learned from their peers whose parents fail<br/>\n&gt; to recognize polite, respectful means of expressing themselves (ok,<br/>\n&gt; was that nice enough and did it convey my point?? No?  Ok, the kids<br/>\n&gt; were smarty pants, brats :-)  We, once again, started them in this<br/>\n&gt; same school, different class (year-round Montessori school-- what a<br/>\n&gt; joke!) hoping they&#39;d have a different experience.  They both<br/>\n&gt; DETESTED it.  They didn&#39;t like their teachers, they didn&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt; their peers, their environment was HOTTTT in the summer because of<br/>\n&gt; lack of air conditioning, etc. etc. etc.  I heard about charter<br/>\n&gt; schools and began investigating them.  I found a brand new one that<br/>\n&gt; had opened up and they had 2 spots for 2 kindergartners-- perfect!<br/>\n&gt; My kids were enrolled the following week.  Let me preface this by<br/>\n&gt; saying that I used to work in the school systems as an interpreter<br/>\n&gt; for the Deaf.  As a matter of fact, I worked at the<br/>\n&gt; *very* &quot;Montessori&quot; (ha, a joke) school my children initially<br/>\n&gt; started.  This new charter school is, hands down, the best public<br/>\n&gt; school I&#39;ve ever seen in my entire life.  My son absotively has the<br/>\n&gt; best teacher I&#39;ve ever met and he loves her to death.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let me give a little background on my children.  Firstly, my son,<br/>\n&gt; Coliya, is exceptionally gifted-- he&#39;s tested off the charts.  We<br/>\n&gt; brought him home from Ukraine and he had some attachment issues<br/>\n&gt; related to abuse and neglect.  He has come a VERY long way from a<br/>\n&gt; little boy who had no conscience, caring, genuine concern or<br/>\n&gt; feelings for anyone but himself to a boy who is respectful,<br/>\n&gt; empathetic, sensitive and just as selfish as any other 5 year old<br/>\n&gt; is :)  (Yes, I&#39;m patting myself on the back for this-- I can blow<br/>\n&gt; raspberries at all of the naysayers who disagreed with the methods I<br/>\n&gt; used to parent him INCLUDING my husband, initially!)  Coliya is also<br/>\n&gt; hyperactive.  To be perfectly honest, I think there&#39;s a *definite*<br/>\n&gt; connection to intelligence and the degree of one&#39;s perceived<br/>\n&gt; hyperactivity.  Having said that, I&#39;d still say he&#39;s hyperactive---<br/>\n&gt; LOL.  He&#39;s the most curious, quickest learner, who doesn&#39;t forget a<br/>\n&gt; thing, ever.  Let&#39;s move to my daughter, Lyllia.  Lyllia is &quot;stuck&quot;<br/>\n&gt; emotionally at about a 3 year old level.  She&#39;s quite intelligent<br/>\n&gt; and very imaginative, she is just very emotionall immature &quot;for her<br/>\n&gt; age&quot; (comparing to the &quot;norms&quot;, whatever those are!).  She lives in<br/>\n&gt; her own little world, doing things at her own pace, as she pleases,<br/>\n&gt; IF she pleases, as the notion strikes her.  This is in *everything*<br/>\n&gt; she does from schoolwork to getting dressed, to eating, to walking,<br/>\n&gt; to playing-- EVERYTHING.  I&#39;ve tried to change this behavior (don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; yell at me-- I was ignorant then!) to no avail (OBVIOUSLY!)  I have<br/>\n&gt; since learned that this is her and for me to even attempt to change<br/>\n&gt; this about her would be detrimental to her as a person.  (It took me<br/>\n&gt; awhile to come around but, I did, finally!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Enter my predicament.  I am wanting to take Lyllia out of school<br/>\n&gt; because it&#39;s not working and it hasn&#39;t worked and it&#39;s not going to<br/>\n&gt; work because it just doesn&#39;t work for her.  I also feel that I<br/>\n&gt; should take Coliya out, although it&#39;s working for him at least in<br/>\n&gt; theory, right now.  I&#39;ll be honest-- I don&#39;t think I can handle<br/>\n&gt; unschooling both of them at the same time, initially.  Can I tell<br/>\n&gt; you how much GUILT I feel about that???  I feel completely<br/>\n&gt; inadequate.  Like any other mother on this list or in the world<br/>\n&gt; could take both of them out and be super-mom and I&#39;m failing in so<br/>\n&gt; many ways!  As if leaving him in makes me a bad mom.  I honestly<br/>\n&gt; feel this way.  These are all feelings I have and I haven&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; STARTED the process!!!  Should I take them both out and try this?<br/>\n&gt; Should I take her out and leave him in because it&#39;s currently<br/>\n&gt; working for him?  Should I just forget the whole thing altogether<br/>\n&gt; and keep it as it is?  (Yeah, right!)  I seriously think that if I<br/>\n&gt; took them both out to do it, I&#39;d go insane :-)  I wish I were<br/>\n&gt; kidding.  But I will do anything, if it&#39;s best for my children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband is a self-learner.  He was unschooled his whole life.  Of<br/>\n&gt; course, they didn&#39;t call it that back then.  He was taken out of<br/>\n&gt; school to work for his family, to support them (he&#39;s only 35).  The<br/>\n&gt; man is nothing short of a genius.  His unschooling has made him far<br/>\n&gt; more capable than any of his counterparts in his field (engineering)<br/>\n&gt; however, he lacks a formal education which sometimes stands in his<br/>\n&gt; way.  The strange part about this whole thing is, he has more doubts<br/>\n&gt; than me.  Here&#39;s a man who is living proof that you don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; to &quot;attend school&quot; to develop your potential and to LEARN.  Yet,<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s scared about our daughter not &quot;learning enough&quot;.  &quot;How will she<br/>\n&gt; learn her ABC&#39;s if there&#39;s no structured environment?&quot;  &quot;How will<br/>\n&gt; she learn to read?&quot;  &quot;How will...&quot; these are questions he continues<br/>\n&gt; to ask.  And guess what?  I don&#39;t have an answer for him because I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have a clue.  And I told him *just* that.  He&#39;s supportive of<br/>\n&gt; me homeschooling and unschooling, to a certain extent because, as he<br/>\n&gt; said, &quot;I have always believed that&#39;s how a child should learn---<br/>\n&gt; hands on, from everything around him-- going to the store, mowing<br/>\n&gt; the lawn-- everything is a learning experience.&quot;  I know that if he<br/>\n&gt; feels that I feel it&#39;s best, he will trust my judgment, at least for<br/>\n&gt; a little while, just to see how things go.  I feel it certainly<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t hurt.  What we are doing right now isn&#39;t working so, trying<br/>\n&gt; something else couldn&#39;t work any LESS-- what do I have to lose?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, where do I begin?  How do I &quot;meet the requirements&quot; of Ohio by<br/>\n&gt; unschooling?  I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be thrilled to get the piece of paper<br/>\n&gt; across their desk that says I&#39;m withdrawing her from school (sorry,<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know the formal names of the paperwork yet!) saying &quot;yeah,<br/>\n&gt; we are just going to see what happens&quot;...lol.  No, no, I&#39;m being<br/>\n&gt; facetious.  I know that I have to put something under curriculum--<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just not sure what?  Also, where do I start with a 5 year old<br/>\n&gt; who is, emotionally 3 or 3.5 years old, at best?  As far as<br/>\n&gt; attempting to progress her emotionally, I plan on regressing her,<br/>\n&gt; going back through the stages she missed when I wasn&#39;t there to be<br/>\n&gt; her mommy.  I think this will be *highly* beneficial based on the<br/>\n&gt; research I&#39;ve been doing.  But as far as &quot;schooling&quot; goes-- what<br/>\n&gt; approach do I take for someone who is so young?  I read Sandra<br/>\n&gt; Dodd&#39;s website this morning-- the part that concerned deschooling<br/>\n&gt; and I&#39;m thinking that might, indeed, be the way to go.  But, what do<br/>\n&gt; I know?  I am TOTALLY clueless.  I feel like I&#39;m like I&#39;m a sailboat<br/>\n&gt; in the middle of the ocean, waiting for a strong wind to give me<br/>\n&gt; some direction.  The question is-- will y&#39;all be my strong wind and<br/>\n&gt; guide me?  I&#39;m really lost and I sincerely need help and I *really*<br/>\n&gt; want to make this work.  I want to do what&#39;s right for my children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you so much, in advance, if you&#39;ve made it through this<br/>\n&gt; novel.

What is the mandatory age<br/>\nfor schooling in Ohio.  I am sure you can find that on the internet or by<br/>\ncalling a Homeschool association in Ohio.  I took my son out of school when<br/>\nhe was beginning the first grade.  He was six years old at the time.  I live<br/>\nin North Dakota, and didn&#39;t know much about homeschooling at the time (we<br/>\nmade the decision on a Friday and withdrew him the next Monday), but what I<br/>\nfound out is that the age for compulsory education is 7, so legally he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t even have to be in school.  I suspect that may be true in Ohio too.<br/>\nI will try to find that and let you know.  If that is the case, all you have<br/>\nto do is say you do not feel she is ready to be in school.  Actually, that<br/>\nis all you have to say anyway at this point.  I know many people in this<br/>\narea who have waited a year to put their children in school.  Just because<br/>\nyou don&#39;t intend to ever put her back in, does not mean that you cannot tell<br/>\nthem that now.  It is true, from what you say.  And then just go back to<br/>\nliving like you did before the children started school, and read, read, read<br/>\nabout unschooling, homeschooling, etc.  She will be fine :&gt;! (As he will,<br/>\nand I am sure once you figure the whole thing out you will know what is best<br/>\nfor the whole family).<br/>\n<br/>\nmany blessings,<br/>\nerin<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beaglette@...\">beaglette@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 07, 2003 8:18 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Need help-- please!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This is long but please bear with me-- I need some help!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll start off by introducing myself.

Human beings have much greater<br/>\nlearning abilities than birds and rodents.  Children don&#39;t need an<br/>\norganized system of deprivation and reward to make learning happen.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t even think they need a &quot;structured environment&quot;.  I think they<br/>\nneed an interesting environment and exposure to a rich life.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour husband might really benefit from reading Linda Dobson&#39;s column,<br/>\nThe Gift of Flow, in the Nov-Dec 2002 issue of HEM.  I really thought it<br/>\nwas great.  (And it sounds complicated and scientific.  I just don&#39;t<br/>\nknow if it&#39;s clear for someone who hasn&#39;t had a lot of exposure to<br/>\nhomeschooling and unschooling already.  It&#39;s pretty sophisticated stuff.)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe quotes from Csikszentmihaly&#39;s book, Finding Flow: The Psychology of<br/>\nEngagement with Everyday Life.  The third condition for achieving flow<br/>\nis &quot;A person&#39;s skills are fully involved in overcoming a challenge that<br/>\nis just about manageable.&quot;  I think this is the level that unschooled<br/>\nchildren seek out for themselves.  In education school, my husband (a<br/>\nteacher) studied similar concepts, but it&#39;s nearly impossible for him to<br/>\nestablish tasks for his 9th Graders that engage them that much and<br/>\nchallenge them just the right amount.  Yet this happens very naturally<br/>\nin unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe decision about taking one or both kids out of school is a tough one.<br/>\n Especially when you are pregnant and will soon be busy with an infant. <br/>\nIf you feel that one of your children is being more harmed by<br/>\nKindergarden than the other, then I can understand why you would want to<br/>\ntake that child out first.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\n**He&#39;s supportive of <br/>\nme homeschooling and unschooling, to a certain extent because, as he <br/>\nsaid, &quot;I have always believed that&#39;s how a child should learn--- <br/>\nhands on, from everything around him-- going to the store, mowing <br/>\nthe lawn-- everything is a learning experience.&quot; **<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a good start.  Maybe he&#39;s just having a hard time believing it<br/>\nalso works with less concrete topics, like the alphabet.<br/>\n<br/>\n** Also, where do I start with a 5 year old <br/>\nwho is, emotionally 3 or 3.5 years old, at best?**<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say start where you are: love, cuddling and play.

My name is Brandi.  I&#39;m a 30 <br/>\nyear old stay-at-home mom of the most wonderfully intelligent, <br/>\ngorgeous children on the planet whom we adopted from Ukraine in <br/>\n1999.  They are both 5 years old, one boy, one girl, four months <br/>\napart in age.  They are currently enrolled in kindergarten.  We lost <br/>\na baby in 1998 and I am pregnant with our fourth child and due in <br/>\nJune. You can learn more about me at my website: www.brandiland.com <br/>\n <br/>\nWe started the kids in a head start type program the last semester <br/>\nof last school year.  I regret ever having introduced them to the <br/>\nschool system because now it is *impossible* to unteach them the <br/>\nbehaviors that they have learned from their peers whose parents fail <br/>\nto recognize polite, respectful means of expressing themselves (ok, <br/>\nwas that nice enough and did it convey my point?? No?  Ok, the kids <br/>\nwere smarty pants, brats :-)  We, once again, started them in this <br/>\nsame school, different class (year-round Montessori school-- what a <br/>\njoke!) hoping they&#39;d have a different experience.  They both <br/>\nDETESTED it.  They didn&#39;t like their teachers, they didn&#39;t like <br/>\ntheir peers, their environment was HOTTTT in the summer because of <br/>\nlack of air conditioning, etc. etc. etc.  I heard about charter <br/>\nschools and began investigating them.  I found a brand new one that <br/>\nhad opened up and they had 2 spots for 2 kindergartners-- perfect!  <br/>\nMy kids were enrolled the following week.  Let me preface this by <br/>\nsaying that I used to work in the school systems as an interpreter <br/>\nfor the Deaf.  As a matter of fact, I worked at the <br/>\n*very* &quot;Montessori&quot; (ha, a joke) school my children initially <br/>\nstarted.  This new charter school is, hands down, the best public <br/>\nschool I&#39;ve ever seen in my entire life.  My son absotively has the <br/>\nbest teacher I&#39;ve ever met and he loves her to death.  <br/>\n <br/>\nLet me give a little background on my children.  Firstly, my son, <br/>\nColiya, is exceptionally gifted-- he&#39;s tested off the charts.  We <br/>\nbrought him home from Ukraine and he had some attachment issues <br/>\nrelated to abuse and neglect.  He has come a VERY long way from a <br/>\nlittle boy who had no conscience, caring, genuine concern or <br/>\nfeelings for anyone but himself to a boy who is respectful, <br/>\nempathetic, sensitive and just as selfish as any other 5 year old <br/>\nis :)  (Yes, I&#39;m patting myself on the back for this-- I can blow <br/>\nraspberries at all of the naysayers who disagreed with the methods I <br/>\nused to parent him INCLUDING my husband, initially!)  Coliya is also <br/>\nhyperactive.  To be perfectly honest, I think there&#39;s a *definite* <br/>\nconnection to intelligence and the degree of one&#39;s perceived <br/>\nhyperactivity.  Having said that, I&#39;d still say he&#39;s hyperactive--- <br/>\nLOL.  He&#39;s the most curious, quickest learner, who doesn&#39;t forget a <br/>\nthing, ever.  Let&#39;s move to my daughter, Lyllia.  Lyllia is &quot;stuck&quot; <br/>\nemotionally at about a 3 year old level.  She&#39;s quite intelligent <br/>\nand very imaginative, she is just very emotionall immature &quot;for her <br/>\nage&quot; (comparing to the &quot;norms&quot;, whatever those are!).  She lives in <br/>\nher own little world, doing things at her own pace, as she pleases, <br/>\nIF she pleases, as the notion strikes her.  This is in *everything* <br/>\nshe does from schoolwork to getting dressed, to eating, to walking, <br/>\nto playing-- EVERYTHING.  I&#39;ve tried to change this behavior (don&#39;t <br/>\nyell at me-- I was ignorant then!) to no avail (OBVIOUSLY!)  I have <br/>\nsince learned that this is her and for me to even attempt to change <br/>\nthis about her would be detrimental to her as a person.  (It took me <br/>\nawhile to come around but, I did, finally!)<br/>\n <br/>\nEnter my predicament.  I am wanting to take Lyllia out of school <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s not working and it hasn&#39;t worked and it&#39;s not going to <br/>\nwork because it just doesn&#39;t work for her.  I also feel that I <br/>\nshould take Coliya out, although it&#39;s working for him at least in <br/>\ntheory, right now.  I&#39;ll be honest-- I don&#39;t think I can handle <br/>\nunschooling both of them at the same time, initially.  Can I tell <br/>\nyou how much GUILT I feel about that???  I feel completely <br/>\ninadequate.  Like any other mother on this list or in the world <br/>\ncould take both of them out and be super-mom and I&#39;m failing in so <br/>\nmany ways!  As if leaving him in makes me a bad mom.  I honestly <br/>\nfeel this way.  These are all feelings I have and I haven&#39;t even <br/>\nSTARTED the process!!!  Should I take them both out and try this?  <br/>\nShould I take her out and leave him in because it&#39;s currently <br/>\nworking for him?  Should I just forget the whole thing altogether <br/>\nand keep it as it is?  (Yeah, right!)  I seriously think that if I <br/>\ntook them both out to do it, I&#39;d go insane :-)  I wish I were <br/>\nkidding.  But I will do anything, if it&#39;s best for my children.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband is a self-learner.  He was unschooled his whole life.  Of <br/>\ncourse, they didn&#39;t call it that back then.  He was taken out of <br/>\nschool to work for his family, to support them (he&#39;s only 35).  The <br/>\nman is nothing short of a genius.  His unschooling has made him far <br/>\nmore capable than any of his counterparts in his field (engineering) <br/>\nhowever, he lacks a formal education which sometimes stands in his <br/>\nway.  The strange part about this whole thing is, he has more doubts <br/>\nthan me.  Here&#39;s a man who is living proof that you don&#39;t have <br/>\nto &quot;attend school&quot; to develop your potential and to LEARN.  Yet, <br/>\nhe&#39;s scared about our daughter not &quot;learning enough&quot;.  &quot;How will she <br/>\nlearn her ABC&#39;s if there&#39;s no structured environment?&quot;  &quot;How will <br/>\nshe learn to read?&quot;  &quot;How will...&quot; these are questions he continues <br/>\nto ask.  And guess what?  I don&#39;t have an answer for him because I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have a clue.  And I told him *just* that.  He&#39;s supportive of <br/>\nme homeschooling and unschooling, to a certain extent because, as he <br/>\nsaid, &quot;I have always believed that&#39;s how a child should learn--- <br/>\nhands on, from everything around him-- going to the store, mowing <br/>\nthe lawn-- everything is a learning experience.&quot;  I know that if he <br/>\nfeels that I feel it&#39;s best, he will trust my judgment, at least for <br/>\na little while, just to see how things go.  I feel it certainly <br/>\ncan&#39;t hurt.  What we are doing right now isn&#39;t working so, trying <br/>\nsomething else couldn&#39;t work any LESS-- what do I have to lose?<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, where do I begin?  How do I &quot;meet the requirements&quot; of Ohio by <br/>\nunschooling?  I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be thrilled to get the piece of paper <br/>\nacross their desk that says I&#39;m withdrawing her from school (sorry, <br/>\nI don&#39;t know the formal names of the paperwork yet!) saying &quot;yeah, <br/>\nwe are just going to see what happens&quot;...lol.  No, no, I&#39;m being <br/>\nfacetious.  I know that I have to put something under curriculum-- <br/>\nI&#39;m just not sure what?  Also, where do I start with a 5 year old <br/>\nwho is, emotionally 3 or 3.5 years old, at best?  As far as <br/>\nattempting to progress her emotionally, I plan on regressing her, <br/>\ngoing back through the stages she missed when I wasn&#39;t there to be <br/>\nher mommy.  I think this will be *highly* beneficial based on the <br/>\nresearch I&#39;ve been doing.  But as far as &quot;schooling&quot; goes-- what <br/>\napproach do I take for someone who is so young?  I read Sandra <br/>\nDodd&#39;s website this morning-- the part that concerned deschooling <br/>\nand I&#39;m thinking that might, indeed, be the way to go.  But, what do <br/>\nI know?

The question is-- will y&#39;all be my strong wind and <br/>\nguide me?  I&#39;m really lost and I sincerely need help and I *really* <br/>\nwant to make this work.

You can learn more about me at my website: www.brandiland.com <br/>\n<br/>\nWe started the kids in a head start type program the last semester of last school year.  I regret ever having introduced them to the school system because now it is *impossible* to unteach them the behaviors that they have learned from their peers whose parents fail to recognize polite, respectful means of expressing themselves (ok, was that nice enough and did it convey my point?? No?  Ok, the kids were smarty pants, brats :-)  We, once again, started them in this same school, different class (year-round Montessori school-- what a joke!) hoping they&#39;d have a different experience.  They both DETESTED it.  They didn&#39;t like their teachers, they didn&#39;t like their peers, their environment was HOTTTT in the summer because of lack of air conditioning, etc. etc. etc.  I heard about charter schools and began investigating them.  I found a brand new one that had opened up and they had 2 spots for 2 kindergartners-- perfect!  My kids were enrolled the following week.  Let me preface this by saying that I used to work in the school systems as an interpreter for the Deaf.  As a matter of fact, I worked at the *very* &quot;Montessori&quot; (ha, a joke) school my children initially started.  This new charter school is, hands down, the best public school I&#39;ve ever seen in my entire life.  My son absotively has the best teacher I&#39;ve ever met and he loves her to death.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me give a little background on my children.  Firstly, my son, Coliya, is exceptionally gifted-- he&#39;s tested off the charts.  We brought him home from Ukraine and he had some attachment issues related to abuse and neglect.  He has come a VERY long way from a little boy who had no conscience, caring, genuine concern or feelings for anyone but himself to a boy who is respectful, empathetic, sensitive and just as selfish as any other 5 year old is :)  (Yes, I&#39;m patting myself on the back for this-- I can blow raspberries at all of the naysayers who disagreed with the methods I used to parent him INCLUDING my husband, initially!)  Coliya is also hyperactive.  To be perfectly honest, I think there&#39;s a *definite* connection to intelligence and the degree of one&#39;s perceived hyperactivity.  Having said that, I&#39;d still say he&#39;s hyperactive--- LOL.  He&#39;s the most curious, quickest learner, who doesn&#39;t forget a thing, ever.  Let&#39;s move to my daughter, Lyllia.  Lyllia is &quot;stuck&quot; emotionally at about a 3 year old level.  She&#39;s quite intelligent and very imaginative, she is just very emotionall immature &quot;for her age&quot; (comparing to the &quot;norms&quot;, whatever those are!).  She lives in her own little world, doing things at her own pace, as she pleases, IF she pleases, as the notion strikes her.  This is in *everything* she does from schoolwork to getting dressed, to eating, to walking, to playing-- EVERYTHING.  I&#39;ve tried to change this behavior (don&#39;t yell at me-- I was ignorant then!) to no avail (OBVIOUSLY!)  I have since learned that this is her and for me to even attempt to change this about her would be detrimental to her as a person.  (It took me awhile to come around but, I did, finally!)<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter my predicament.  I am wanting to take Lyllia out of school because it&#39;s not working and it hasn&#39;t worked and it&#39;s not going to work because it just doesn&#39;t work for her.  I also feel that I should take Coliya out, although it&#39;s working for him at least in theory, right now.  I&#39;ll be honest-- I don&#39;t think I can handle unschooling both of them at the same time, initially.  Can I tell you how much GUILT I feel about that???  I feel completely inadequate.  Like any other mother on this list or in the world could take both of them out and be super-mom and I&#39;m failing in so many ways!  As if leaving him in makes me a bad mom.  I honestly feel this way.  These are all feelings I have and I haven&#39;t even STARTED the process!!!  Should I take them both out and try this?  Should I take her out and leave him in because it&#39;s currently working for him?  Should I just forget the whole thing altogether and keep it as it is?  (Yeah, right!)  I seriously think that if I took them both out to do it, I&#39;d go insane :-)  I wish I were kidding.  But I will do anything, if it&#39;s best for my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is a self-learner.  He was unschooled his whole life.  Of course, they didn&#39;t call it that back then.  He was taken out of school to work for his family, to support them (he&#39;s only 35).  The man is nothing short of a genius.  His unschooling has made him far more capable than any of his counterparts in his field (engineering) however, he lacks a formal education which sometimes stands in his way.  The strange part about this whole thing is, he has more doubts than me.  Here&#39;s a man who is living proof that you don&#39;t have to &quot;attend school&quot; to develop your potential and to LEARN.  Yet, he&#39;s scared about our daughter not &quot;learning enough&quot;.  &quot;How will she learn her ABC&#39;s if there&#39;s no structured environment?&quot;  &quot;How will she learn to read?&quot;  &quot;How will...&quot; these are questions he continues to ask.  And guess what?  I don&#39;t have an answer for him because I don&#39;t have a clue.  And I told him *just* that.  He&#39;s supportive of me homeschooling and unschooling, to a certain extent because, as he said, &quot;I have always believed that&#39;s how a child should learn--- hands on, from everything around him-- going to the store, mowing the lawn-- everything is a learning experience.&quot;  I know that if he feels that I feel it&#39;s best, he will trust my judgment, at least for a little while, just to see how things go.  I feel it certainly can&#39;t hurt.  What we are doing right now isn&#39;t working so, trying something else couldn&#39;t work any LESS-- what do I have to lose?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, where do I begin?  How do I &quot;meet the requirements&quot; of Ohio by unschooling?  I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be thrilled to get the piece of paper across their desk that says I&#39;m withdrawing her from school (sorry, I don&#39;t know the formal names of the paperwork yet!) saying &quot;yeah, we are just going to see what happens&quot;...lol.  No, no, I&#39;m being facetious.  I know that I have to put something under curriculum-- I&#39;m just not sure what?  Also, where do I start with a 5 year old who is, emotionally 3 or 3.5 years old, at best?  As far as attempting to progress her emotionally, I plan on regressing her, going back through the stages she missed when I wasn&#39;t there to be her mommy.  I think this will be *highly* beneficial based on the research I&#39;ve been doing.  But as far as &quot;schooling&quot; goes-- what approach do I take for someone who is so young?  I read Sandra Dodd&#39;s website this morning-- the part that concerned deschooling and I&#39;m thinking that might, indeed, be the way to go.  But, what do I know?  I am TOTALLY clueless.  I feel like I&#39;m like I&#39;m a sailboat in the middle of the ocean, waiting for a strong wind to give me some direction.  The question is-- will y&#39;all be my strong wind and guide me?  I&#39;m really lost and I sincerely need help and I *really* want to make this work.  I want to do what&#39;s right for my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much, in advance, if you&#39;ve made it through this novel.
