You really have a much harder time doing the defining sorts of<br/>\nthings if you are not there more often than not.  He returns to this theme quite<br/>\na bit.  It really also has to do with being proactive towards children.  Not just<br/>\nreacting to what they do but to their &quot;just being&quot;.  It involves making a big<br/>\ndeal over them and engaging them.  We do this automatically with babies but have<br/>\nmore trouble doing it as they get older.  Just remember that feeling you have<br/>\ntowards babies.... focus, total wonderment, etc. and find it with your kids when<br/>\nthey are older.  That seems to be the heart of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe talks about &quot;passing the attachment baton&quot; when leaving your kids in the care<br/>\nof someone else.  By this he means introductions and orientation. e.g. This Betty<br/>\nwho is going to be looking after you. Betty this is Olivia who you will be<br/>\nlooking after. Olivia, Betty will be showing you what you need to do here and if<br/>\nyou have any questions you will ask Betty.  Words to that effect.  It requires<br/>\nthe adult caregiver to make an effort to get to know the child and pay direct<br/>\nattention to that child.  Some people do this well and intuitively others are<br/>\nthick as bricks and just don&#39;t get it.  If it is done successfully the child has<br/>\nmuch less anxiety and knows who to orient themselves around.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is so hard to do this stuff justice.  We are going to session #8 tomorrow<br/>\n(tonight really).  That will make 16 hours of material and he is always behind<br/>\nwhere he wants to be.  Really what he is talking about could be a degree program<br/>\nas far as I can tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur experience in this class is very much one of having someone put into words<br/>\nand a theoretical model much of which we know intuitively.  It is nice to have<br/>\n&quot;academic&quot;  and &quot;professional&quot; support for what we know.  Though at this point in<br/>\nour lives we don&#39;t really care what the experts think because they are so<br/>\nconfused on so many issues.

He believes that if attachment needs<br/>\nare used to manipulate behaviour it causes children to experience enormous<br/>\nanxiety which they of necessity desensitize themselves to feeling.  Examples<br/>\nwould be separation. &quot;You go to your room.&quot; I don&#39;t want to see you around here<br/>\nuntil..... If you go on behaving that way I am just going to ......  Don&#39;t talk<br/>\nto me.....  Things which involve withdrawal of affection.  He is of course<br/>\nadvocating something hard to do namely don&#39;t let your emotions get the better of<br/>\nyou.  He also talks of the necessity for lots of proximity, generously given<br/>\ntime, expressions of delight in our children not when they are &quot;being good&#39; or<br/>\nwhen they accomplish something but when they are just being.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is the punitive edge of &quot;consequences&quot; to which I believe he is referring.<br/>\nIf there are natural consequences to someone&#39;s behaviour and they are able to<br/>\nhandle the consequences it is fine.  You don&#39;t let the 18 month old tumble down<br/>\nthe hillside to learn about the consequences of going too far from their<br/>\nparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou of course are &quot;way ahead&quot; by not spanking and talking lots and modeling what<br/>\nyou believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for teaching our children we do in fact rely on their desire to please us but<br/>\nalways with the utmost care, respect and thoughtfulness.  We have enormous power<br/>\nand if we use it to manipulate our kids behaviour simply to get our way we will<br/>\nlose it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople use to (and probably many still do) use threats of fearful things to get<br/>\nbehaviour they want from their children.  The bogeyman et. al. were used in many<br/>\ncircles as what was considered a valid form of childrearing.  You scared the<br/>\nchildren into obedience.  Of course eventually they weren&#39;t scared anymore and<br/>\ntold you to bugger off not to mention feeling more than a little angry and at<br/>\nbeing lied to and frightened.<br/>\n<br/>\nGordon Neufeld is really quite big on adults &quot;taking charge&quot;.  More than I am<br/>\ncomfortable with but I understand his rationale.  He believes that we must<br/>\nengage our children&#39;s attachment needs and meet them or they will attach to<br/>\nothers (usually peers) and will be lost to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe maintains that emergent behaviours (independence and individuality) come in<br/>\ntheir own sweet time and we are generally in much too great of a rush for such<br/>\nthings.  We value a great deal of superficial sociability in the place of real<br/>\nintimacy and connectedness.  Peer interaction comes naturally at its own pace<br/>\nand always within the context of a solid home base never as a substitute.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is so much material that has been covered I am hard pressed to do it<br/>\njustice.

He is absolutely intense about the<br/>\nneed for<br/>\n&gt; restricting peer interaction especially at younger ages but absolutely at<br/>\nolder<br/>\n&gt; ages too if need be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He describes the process of &quot;wooing&quot; children who have drifted from their<br/>\n&gt; parents.  He took his adolescent daughter to a geographically isolated<br/>\n&quot;favorite&quot;<br/>\n&gt; place, made sure the TV was broken, and lived with her bitter complaints<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; boredom for about three days before he was able to reconnect with her.<br/>\nThey<br/>\n&gt; reestablished the connection they had when she was a child and have never<br/>\nallowed<br/>\n&gt; it to be broken again.  She is 27 now, studying music in Salzburg and<br/>\nstill has a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;special&quot; time with her father once a week by phone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gordon believes that even with adolescents there is a need to restrict<br/>\npeer<br/>\n&gt; interaction.  He believes in taking a proactive stance of organizing<br/>\nactivity for<br/>\n&gt; families which brings them together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is of course complicated when the children in question are &quot;defended&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Meaning that they have hardened, lost their sensitivities and resist<br/>\nattachment<br/>\n&gt; driven relationships (except for the primarily sterile substitutes they<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; found with peers).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think if I found myself with teenagers who were being absorbed by peer<br/>\nculture<br/>\n&gt; I would do whatever was necessary to break the cycle. This would include<br/>\nmoving<br/>\n&gt; if that is what it took.  Spending lots of time with them is a key.  If<br/>\nthey are<br/>\n&gt; peer identified this of course is the last thing they want to do.  It has<br/>\nto be a<br/>\n&gt; process of wooing with the velvet glove being foremost with iron resolve<br/>\nbeneath<br/>\n&gt; but not a fist.  If I am not mangling metaphors too badly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Defendedness occurs when attachment has been used as a weapon to<br/>\nmanipulate<br/>\n&gt; behaviour.  Separation, time-outs, &quot;consequences&quot; these result in<br/>\nemotional<br/>\n&gt; desensitivty and take a lot of effort to undo.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Children follow the lead of their parents naturally if parents understand<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; developmental needs of their children.  Most people are terribly confused.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; People have come to accept &quot;typical&quot; behaviour as &quot;normal&quot; which is<br/>\nabsolutely<br/>\n&gt; not the case.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Much of this language reflects Gordon Neufeld&#39;s approach. For us it is<br/>\nagain<br/>\n&gt; reinforcement for that which we hold true already.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Being proactive and defining your families &quot;life&quot; to reflect your values<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; crucial.  It must be done with sensitivity and respect but with<br/>\ninsistence.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The &quot;wooing&quot; which comes automatically with infants cannot be abandoned<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; older children.  I have first hand experienced this change in my own<br/>\n&gt; relationships with my children. If I bring the same &#39;focus&#39; to bear with<br/>\nmy six<br/>\n&gt; and ten year olds that I had when they were babies we do great.  It is a<br/>\nkind of<br/>\n&gt; enthusiasm and willingness to accommodate their needs, listen to them with<br/>\n&gt; enormous sensitivity and spend lots of voluntary time with them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; People are fooled by the superficial independence of peer identified<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n&gt; They have less &quot;work&quot; as parents because their kids seem to &quot;take care&quot; of<br/>\n&gt; themselves.  It is, of course, a lie.  They don&#39;t take care of themselves<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; try to meet their attachment needs with peers which is an empty pursuit<br/>\nwhich<br/>\n&gt; leaves them hungry and addicted to peer interaction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of course the economic smoke and mirrors we live in doesn&#39;t help.  The<br/>\nfact that<br/>\n&gt; it now takes two incomes to maintain what we have come to expect as a<br/>\nnormal<br/>\n&gt; lifestyle further erodes home life.  We are told we live in boom times but<br/>\nNorth<br/>\n&gt; Americans work more hours than any industrialized country.

I know this is a long <br/>\nshot but I really don&#39;t know what else to do. <br/>\n    Not even sure this is doable, dh worries that something will happen to us <br/>\nand I would worry too in his place.

Since then, she has become a <br/>\nperson who stays home a lot, reads things that she finds interesting, doesn&#39;t <br/>\ndo drugs, and has stopped hanging out with her gang friends because she just <br/>\nfeels like she doesn&#39;t relate to them very well now.

He is absolutely intense about the need","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-899993883\">Attending the Gordon Neufeld parenting course has reinforced many observations we<br/>\nhave had about children generally.  He is absolutely intense about the need for<br/>\nrestricting peer interaction especially at younger ages but absolutely at older<br/>\nages too if need be.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe describes the process of &quot;wooing&quot; children who have drifted from their<br/>\nparents.  He took his adolescent daughter to a geographically isolated &quot;favorite&quot;<br/>\nplace, made sure the TV was broken, and lived with her bitter complaints of<br/>\nboredom for about three days before he was able to reconnect with her.  They<br/>\nreestablished the connection they had when she was a child and have never allowed<br/>\nit to be broken again.  She is 27 now, studying music in Salzburg and still has a<br/>\n&quot;special&quot; time with her father once a week by phone.<br/>\n<br/>\nGordon believes that even with adolescents there is a need to restrict peer<br/>\ninteraction.  He believes in taking a proactive stance of organizing activity for<br/>\nfamilies which brings them together.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is of course complicated when the children in question are &quot;defended&quot;.<br/>\nMeaning that they have hardened, lost their sensitivities and resist attachment<br/>\ndriven relationships (except for the primarily sterile substitutes they have<br/>\nfound with peers).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if I found myself with teenagers who were being absorbed by peer culture<br/>\nI would do whatever was necessary to break the cycle. This would include moving<br/>\nif that is what it took.  Spending lots of time with them is a key.  If they are<br/>\npeer identified this of course is the last thing they want to do.  It has to be a<br/>\nprocess of wooing with the velvet glove being foremost with iron resolve beneath<br/>\nbut not a fist.  If I am not mangling metaphors too badly.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefendedness occurs when attachment has been used as a weapon to manipulate<br/>\nbehaviour.  Separation, time-outs, &quot;consequences&quot; these result in emotional<br/>\ndesensitivty and take a lot of effort to undo.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren follow the lead of their parents naturally if parents understand the<br/>\ndevelopmental needs of their children.  Most people are terribly confused.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have come to accept &quot;typical&quot; behaviour as &quot;normal&quot; which is absolutely<br/>\nnot the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch of this language reflects Gordon Neufeld&#39;s approach. For us it is again<br/>\nreinforcement for that which we hold true already.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing proactive and defining your families &quot;life&quot; to reflect your values is<br/>\ncrucial.  It must be done with sensitivity and respect but with insistence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;wooing&quot; which comes automatically with infants cannot be abandoned with<br/>\nolder children.  I have first hand experienced this change in my own<br/>\nrelationships with my children. If I bring the same &#39;focus&#39; to bear with my six<br/>\nand ten year olds that I had when they were babies we do great.  It is a kind of<br/>\nenthusiasm and willingness to accommodate their needs, listen to them with<br/>\nenormous sensitivity and spend lots of voluntary time with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople are fooled by the superficial independence of peer identified children.<br/>\nThey have less &quot;work&quot; as parents because their kids seem to &quot;take care&quot; of<br/>\nthemselves.  It is, of course, a lie.  They don&#39;t take care of themselves they<br/>\ntry to meet their attachment needs with peers which is an empty pursuit which<br/>\nleaves them hungry and addicted to peer interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course the economic smoke and mirrors we live in doesn&#39;t help.  The fact that<br/>\nit now takes two incomes to maintain what we have come to expect as a normal<br/>\nlifestyle further erodes home life.  We are told we live in boom times but North<br/>\nAmericans work more hours than any industrialized country.  We are blind to the<br/>\nenormous decline in our standard of living as we revel in the booming economy.<br/>\nThe rich continue to become richer, democracy wilts, and in the midst of this<br/>\npeople try to have a &quot;home&quot;.  It is not a wonder that it is hard to create a home<br/>\nin the midst of intellectual and ethical poverty.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo spare no expense. Do what it takes.

All<br/>\nthought is influenced to some degree by ones surroundings and to a true<br/>\nindependent thinker, main stream life would only be something that one<br/>\ntakes what one needs from it and then tosses the rest aside.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can only &quot;encourage,&quot; not force.  So, if a child has the type of<br/>\npersonality that is not comfortable being a truely independent thinker,<br/>\nthen they won&#39;t.  We  can hope all we want but each child is an individual<br/>\nand only so much of their growth and development is within our powers to<br/>\nhelp or harm.  They have a core personality that is simply them and no<br/>\namount of outside influence, be it good or bad, is going to change the<br/>\nessential them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;John O.
