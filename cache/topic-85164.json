I have been married for 17 years as of next month.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy computer room is wallpapered in coca-cola advertisement wallpaper, <br/>\nI have a coca-cola mousepad and a bright red rug in here, and I am <br/>\ndrinking a coke right now.  I have Johnny Depp&#39;s picture as a <br/>\nscreensaver on the computer, and I have seen Pirates of the Caribbean <br/>\n13 times and the Lord of the Rings movies at least 8 times each in <br/>\ntheaters.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love rocking chairs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am the most unusual person my friends know since I am a christian <br/>\nwho unschools, most of my family is vegetarian except for the 12yo <br/>\nboy who is a carnivore to the max, I wear tye-dye t-shirts and jeans <br/>\nand go barefoot most of the year, love all types of music including <br/>\ncountry and classical, practice attachment parenting and no spanking <br/>\nand am working on no coercive punishment threats (hard habits to <br/>\nbreak, and sometimes the threat slips out of my mouth before I can <br/>\nshut it).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve only been really unschooling since Fall 2002.  Before that we <br/>\nwere relaxed/unit study type homeschoolers, so we have been <br/>\nhomeschooling for 14 years now.  The 5yo has never been &quot;schooled&quot;, <br/>\nand won&#39;t be unless by his choice.  My husband doesn&#39;t understand <br/>\nunschooling, but he doesn&#39;t put much effort into making the kids do <br/>\nschool work, so he seems happy too.  He says, &quot;as long as they are <br/>\nlearning something...&quot;, well, that gives me a ton of leeway, doesn&#39;t <br/>\nit!?  DH jokingly tells people I can make cleaning toilets sound <br/>\neducational :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in a very happy home, I think, anyway.  Right now my 14yo is <br/>\nupstairs resting because she might have mono, my 12yo is out gaming <br/>\nwith some of his older friends, and my 5yo is in his own little world <br/>\nin the living room with hot wheels cars spread all over the room in <br/>\nevery nook and cranny.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have two new little puppies who are 13 weeks old tomorrow, and I <br/>\nam wondering if unschooling works for puppies as well as children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve actually been on the list for a while.  The first time I came in <br/>\nhere thinking I already knew all about unschooling, didn&#39;t take the <br/>\ntime to read for a while, and proceeded to get huffy and offended <br/>\nwhen I was put in my place (and rightly so), so I left.  I later <br/>\nfound out how wrong I really was, and that Sandra had been right, so <br/>\nI came back and lurked a little more humbly and took time to read and <br/>\nthink.  When I disagreed I took more time to think.  Had to sign off <br/>\nagain for a while when family was too busy, but now have returned <br/>\nsince life has slowed a bit for winter, and am enjoying reading and <br/>\nthinking here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past summer, after spending lots of time at the pool with a <br/>\nschool-at-home family, the older kids thought they were tired of <br/>\nunschooling and wanted to return to &quot;curriculum&quot; again this year, so <br/>\nwe sat down and picked some out, but after about 2.5 months, realized <br/>\nthat it was getting in the way of the important things they wanted to <br/>\ndo and enjoyed, so they asked to return to unschooling.  I think that <br/>\nwas the hardest time for me, knowing that we would all be miserable <br/>\nand letting them make that choice anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter, who plays sports for a nearby private christian school, <br/>\nwas toying with the idea of actually going there next year, but went <br/>\nto a party where some of her &quot;friends&quot; were, and they laughed in her <br/>\nface when she told them.  They told her that she would never be able <br/>\nto keep to a schedule or stick to the dress code, that she could <br/>\nnever learn latin, and that she would be &quot;murdered&quot; within 2 weeks by <br/>\nthe workload.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe came home and said she would not want to turn into the snobbish <br/>\njerks her friends were, and that she didn&#39;t want to give up her <br/>\nfreedom to have metallic green hair, sleep late, volunteer for the <br/>\nRed Cross, and paint whenever she wanted to.  In my heart, all I <br/>\ncould think was, &quot;WHEW!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I think I have so many questions to ask everyone, but <br/>\nusually if I just lurk long enough, they get answered. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, with no restrictions on food...my children are allergic <br/>\nto artificial coloring so I feel I do have to restrict that, to keep <br/>\nthem safe...at least for the 5yo who can&#39;t understand that this stuff <br/>\nmakes him a very angry person and hyperactive.  The older two <br/>\nchildren must make their own decision as to whether or not they want <br/>\nto eat that type of food and suffer the migraine headaches and <br/>\nshortened attention span that comes during a reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of this list, we&#39;ve almost successfully eliminated all <br/>\nrestrictions on gameboy, nintendo, food, the 5yo&#39;s pacifier, and tv <br/>\nand bedtimes.  (DH still gets twitchy about bedtimes and too <br/>\nmuch &quot;noise&quot; from the tv.)  I&#39;ve stopped seeing my children&#39;s <br/>\ninterests as &quot;just playing&quot; and &quot;hobbies&quot;, and realized that they are <br/>\nthe avenues by which they are learning important things, and have <br/>\nstopped trying to limit the $$ and time spent pursuing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, Sandra, about rules vs. principles, I love the line from Pirates <br/>\nof the Caribbean when the girl says to Captain Barbosa that he must <br/>\nstick to the Pirates&#39; Code, and he says, &quot;they&#39;re more like <br/>\nguidelines, really...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, enough, the flood gates are closing again.
