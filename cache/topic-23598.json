You can often<br/>\npick up supplies you couldn&#39;t otherwise make at clearance prices.  Even if<br/>\nit isn&#39;t something that you think you would be using right away, or<br/>\nsomething that you haven&#39;t found a use for yet, the clearance stuff can make<br/>\ngreat additions to a rainy day or anytime box ... you&#39;d be surprise what the<br/>\nkids come up with all on their own.  Or maybe not.  We are unschoolers after<br/>\nall.
