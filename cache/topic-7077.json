A suggested pace is two<br/>\nworksheets a day. Some of these sheets can be done in two minutes each<br/>\nothers are way more involved. It is worth working through the K/gr 1<br/>\nbook even ifyour child is say in gr 2. It gives them a chance to get<br/>\nused to how the rods work. Later in the more involved books they are<br/>\nused to explain fractions etc.<br/>\nI like the series because they introduce complicated subjects in their<br/>\nmost simplistic form so when the kids hit something like geometry or<br/>\nalgebra in later years they are familiar with the concepts and aren&#39;t<br/>\npanicked by them.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample...even in the lowest grade books they introduce the concepts of<br/>\n*sets* and algebra; A=2, B=3, C=5 so given that key at the top of the<br/>\npage the kids are asked to find out what A+B= or C+A= then A+B+C=?.<br/>\nThey intoduce negetive numbers in an extremely easy to understand<br/>\nfashion....my oldest was in gr 8 in PS went through her brother&#39;s books<br/>\ncasualy and had a look and went &quot;DUH! now I get it&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey emphasize not pushing and the Lab Sheet Annotation books suggest<br/>\nother activities to reinforce conepts that a child is having difficulty<br/>\ngetting. They even suggest skipping over sections that aren&#39;t being<br/>\nunderstood and going back to them at a later date and letting those who<br/>\nare understanding a concept well, skip ahead to those relative sections<br/>\nin the following books.<br/>\nAll the sheets are consumable and are tear outs. If your child is really<br/>\ngetting to understand a concept well you can go to those related pages<br/>\nthrough out all the books, tear them out and make up a booklet for them<br/>\nin just that concept.<br/>\nWhat passes for drill work in these books is innocuous.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuzz....who wishes the Miquon went past the gr 3/4 range.<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   <br/>\n The Klement Family       &quot;Education is what survives when <br/>\n Darryl, Debbie,           what has been learned has been <br/>\n Kathleen, Nathan &        forgotten&quot;<br/>\n Samantha                  B.F.

Makes it sound like they thought<br/>\nit was too hard but too babyish at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of people are surprised that in the very first Miquon book you get<br/>\ninto things like multiplication and division of fractions. Traditional math<br/>\nprograms don&#39;t get into this type of stuff until much later, but using the<br/>\nrods makes it seem like common sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nI second the opinion that the &quot;Labsheet Annotations&quot; is important to have,<br/>\nalthough the &quot;Notes to Teachers&quot; is not as important. Using the Labsheet<br/>\nAnnotations not only gives you explanations of answers and other activities,<br/>\nbut it also has a chart that explains the code letters and numbers on the<br/>\nwork book pages. These codes enable you to use the system in very different<br/>\nways. You can take a standard approach and just go page by page through the<br/>\nbooks. If your child suddenly develops a fascination with fractions, you may<br/>\ndecide that you want to pursue that. The codes will tell you how to skip<br/>\nthrough the books so you can find just the sections on fractions, going from<br/>\nthe introductory concepts to more advanced concepts. This means you can<br/>\neither go through the books page by page to focus on the level of the<br/>\nmaterials, or you can decide to focus on concepts (adding, length, area,<br/>\nvolume, factoring, squaring etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several things I like about the program. One of the first things<br/>\nis the idea of using colors for the different levels instead of ranking them<br/>\nby grade or age. This frustrates some people because they want to know what<br/>\ngrade level their child is at, but I think kids should work at their own<br/>\nlevel and not have to endure negative pressure because the book says its<br/>\nfor kids younger than them. If grandma asks what level math youre doing and<br/>\nthe response is I finished orange and am just starting red, theres no<br/>\njudgmental information there. Colors are neutral unlike grade levels or<br/>\nnumbers. (By the way, I think there can be just as much negative pressure if<br/>\neveryone is complimenting the child for being ahead of their grade level).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I like is the variety of approaches used. There is good use of<br/>\nmanipulatives and presentation of problems in a variety of ways. There are<br/>\nalso different strategies given for solving problems. For example, one<br/>\nsection on the  addition of a string of numbers shows 8+1+2+9+3=  ? The<br/>\nsolution is not to just get the totals, but to do it by drawing lines to<br/>\nconnect the numbers that add to 10 and then adding them (8+2, 1+9, 3+7).<br/>\nKids too often memorize multiplication tables and learn how to get correct<br/>\nanswers but dont really understand what they are doing. Math is usually<br/>\ntaught as if there is only one right answer and only one right way to get<br/>\nit. But that is not true. At a recent support group meeting, most people<br/>\nsaid that 3x9=27, and they just knew it from memorizing the multiplication<br/>\ntables. I was one of two people that said they rounded the 9 up to 10 and<br/>\nthought of the problem as 30-3.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like that the program is fairly inexpensive. If you find it doesnt<br/>\nwork for your child, you dont feel the urge to force them to use it to get<br/>\nyour moneys worth. If it works very well and your child wants to move more<br/>\nrapidly, you dont have to feel like holding them back because the next book<br/>\nis so expensive. Although the program is designed for grades 1 through 3,<br/>\nmany people use it for 1 through 6 as you are basically at a pre-algebra<br/>\nlevel when you complete the program.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line is that I think most programs teach you to do math, while this<br/>\none puts more emphasis on understanding it on several levels. You see<br/>\ndifferent strategies for solving problems, you do hands on activities that<br/>\nare fun, and you apply what you learn to different situations. Rote<br/>\nmemorization may be good for tests where there is a time limit and you have<br/>\nto answer quickly, but understanding concepts will help you solve more<br/>\nproblems in the long run (especially later in life after you forget all<br/>\nthose equations that you so diligently memorized for a test).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you made it this far and are interested in more information or a place<br/>\nwhere you can get the entire set of Miquon books for under $50, go to the<br/>\nfollowing web page:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.FUN-Books.com/mathematics.htm#Miquon\">http://www.FUN-Books.com/mathematics.htm#Miquon</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to get so long winded!<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly<br/>\nFamily Unschoolers Network<br/>\nwww.unschooling.org<br/>\nwww.FUN-Books.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"The Mowery Family","from":"&quot;The Mowery Family&quot; &lt;jkkddmowery@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"oIapsMWf9N7zl8sgrczJPidL6F3ubLLq0yqroYUb9_hflOomlaICw73iCNkkjDHLcfWhmDuxT9EOkS_bduRA-jbwC51axqiJ7z5jRxTHmALgS8hDyiGl","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] cuisenaire rods & miquon math","postDate":"952589251","msgId":7079,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGYwMWJmODk5ZSQ4NjgwZjZhMCQ2MWI1YWVjN0BvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":7078,"nextInTopic":7080,"prevInTime":7078,"nextInTime":7080,"topicId":7077,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... fascination) until he learned math  so we were looking into getting cuisenaire rods & miquon math and would be interested in the opinions of other and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-468524623\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;rene&#39; told me he couldn&#39;t understand science (chemistry is his present<br/>\n </span></blockquote>fascination) until he learned math  so we were looking into getting<br/>\ncuisenaire rods & miquon math and would be interested in the opinions of<br/>\n<br/>\nother and where the best place to buy it.  we are not interested in<br/>\ndrill type sources.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLast summer we were visiting my mother-in-law up (in midland, mi - home of<br/>\ndow chemical) and a retired chemist was selling a how bunch of stuff - I<br/>\ncould shoot myself for not buying it then, but did not have the car space.<br/>\nI would try garage sales for traditional chemistry stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the others, what about normal kitchen measuring tools.
