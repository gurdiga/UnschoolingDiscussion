Since the subject offers a<br/>\nwide open door for suggesting all sorts of methods of helping &quot;folks&quot;<br/>\nacquire some degree of literacy in order to participate in &quot;the economy,&quot; I<br/>\nam asking permission to respond, since my previous post triggered theirs and<br/>\ntheir assumption seems to be that a communal/ institutional education<br/>\nestablishment is needed, and that implies political activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, we all read that the Cannons are fresh off a &quot;grass-roots&quot; campaign<br/>\neither for or against a state income tax (TN is one of nine states that<br/>\ndon&#39;t have such a tax and it was defeated again last month) so they are<br/>\nadmittedly political animals, so to speak, especially since they posted<br/>\nlinks to Nolan charts and such. Heck, they said they could post enough<br/>\npolitical stuff to &quot;highjack&quot; the list. Imagine that. Where would they get<br/>\nsuch an idea?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, there&#39;s a warning here, the proposed discussion could be just a bit<br/>\nuncomfortable for some, in fact it could turn into a midnight cat fight,<br/>\nbut there&#39;s also some meat on this bone, if it&#39;s thrown up for grabs, and<br/>\nthe group might get off on it -- unschoolin&#39; at its finest. After all it&#39;s<br/>\nAugust, the dog stays under the porch, the pond went dry and the alfalfa is<br/>\njust turnin&#39; blue waitin for the swather.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the Cannons have posed two big questions. Several books have been<br/>\nwritten about both of them already with no end in sight, so literacy is no<br/>\ntrifling matter. Maybe they&#39;re just pulling our chain, hoping to see some<br/>\nmore fur fly. In fairness though, they aught to be taken seriously, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I take a crack at it, I&#39;m asking for permission. I&#39;ve promised not to<br/>\nbe militaristic (never liked the army anyway) so I&#39;ll be kind as a Sunday<br/>\nSchool teacher (which I was once, and the pianist to boot), but the ideas<br/>\n(like Hell and Religion that were so well attended) might raise a cockle or<br/>\ntwo. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhaddya say Joyce?
