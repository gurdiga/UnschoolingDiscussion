I have to say that I<br/>\nhave put toys games etc. in timeout if they won&#39;t put<br/>\nit away when they are finished or if they start<br/>\nfighting over the toy/game and won&#39;t resolve the<br/>\nproblem. Usually/always I put it up high to where they<br/>\ncan&#39;t get it down but where they can see it to remind<br/>\nthem that they can&#39;t play with it because of thier<br/>\nbehiavior. It usually works. Haven&#39;t had a toy in time<br/>\nout for a few weeks now. Oh, I only keep it there for<br/>\nand hour or so depending on how bad the situation is.<br/>\nThe worse the situation the longer it is in. I always<br/>\nget the toy out by the next day. They are 3.5 and 5 so<br/>\nanything longer than that and they forget why it is in<br/>\ntimeout just that they can&#39;t play with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
