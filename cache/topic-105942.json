Danielle Conger got a good mention, but  from <br/>\nsomeone cranky about other stuff.  The good mention was this:<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;I received a copy of your March/April issue today and read it with  <br/>\ninterest, as we are unschooelrs.  I particularly ejoyed Danielle Conger&#39;s  &quot;An <br/>\nUnschooling Landscape.&quot;  Unfortunately, I then stumbled  across...&quot;   [and she goes <br/>\noff about things that weren&#39;t clearly  proven, as the editor and author both <br/>\ncame back in defense.  It was a  threat not to subscribe.]<br/>\n <br/>\nBut that&#39;s not what I came here to say.  There was something about  chores <br/>\nlast time, not by any of us here who are so frequently on about not  requiring <br/>\nchores, but by Naomi Aldort.  There are two very negative  responses and one <br/>\npro to that.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat strikes me is that the two lengthy harangues have those emotional  <br/>\nphrases that people repeat because they heard them.  What seems to have  upset the <br/>\nauthors is that the advice has upset the grandmothers that dwell  inside of <br/>\nthem.  They&#39;re hosts to nay-saying negative inside-people whom  they&#39;re quoting <br/>\nlike crazy in their letters to the editor.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat&#39;s worse is one is anonymous.  If I were a magazine editor I would  never <br/>\nallow anonymous letters.  If people are too cowardly to use their  names, why <br/>\nshould they get an international forum for their negativity?<br/>\n <br/>\nOne thing the anonymous person said was &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if you like it  or <br/>\nnot, it just has to be done.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m going to add that to my &quot;have to&quot; page, I think.
