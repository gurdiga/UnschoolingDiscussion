I <br/>\n  felt out of sync because of sleeping in and got busy with all the things I <br/>\n  had to do. Found my very pregnant neighbor is on bed rest to get to 36 weeks <br/>\n  without having baby first,  and needed to make her some supper, have a grumpy <br/>\n  20month old , dirty dishes, dirty house, wanted desparately to have a shower, <br/>\n  the phone kept ringing. Needed to get supper for my husband to take to work <br/>\n  on his afternoon shift, etc etc. Overwhelmed I guess. My poor 7 year old was <br/>\n  full of ideas for things for us to do, and I couldn&#39;t do them cause I was so <br/>\n  busy. No time for that stuff!!<br/>\n  I finally got the cooking over with, had a shower, even got dressed. Did I <br/>\n  mention that the &quot;Lovely&quot; in-laws dropped by with their &quot;delightful&quot; <br/>\n  pomeranian to pick up some of my horse manure for their plants, looked <br/>\n  horrified with my daughter in nothing but her diaper(her choice, not mine) <br/>\n  and left.(Yaay)<br/>\n  When everything that could be done was done and my husband left for work, I <br/>\n  asked my son if he wanted to go down the road to the regional park at the <br/>\n  river. We decided to do this. How perfect!!! No one else was at the place, <br/>\n  and we walked to the river&#39;s edge and threw rocks and sticks. We listened to <br/>\n  the birds, the wind, the water. My daughter walked in the water with her <br/>\n  shoes on. At first I tried to stop her, but, wise child that she is , she <br/>\n  ignored me. She simply continued to delight in the rocks, water, wind, sticks <br/>\n  and birds. My son enjoyed the sound of a stick whipping in the air, water, <br/>\n  dirt. We found rocks with cracks, stripes, colors. The same stick formation <br/>\n  his dear friend built last year was still there. We talked about the friend, <br/>\n  who has since moved. We looked at the swimming hole, saw minnows, deer poop, <br/>\n  compared it with the moose poop. <br/>\n  A magical afternoon right when a tired frazzled mom needed it. Again and <br/>\n  again my kids can catch me when I am falling, and help me see the wonder of <br/>\n  the small things.I feel so blessed to have this time with them, and to have <br/>\n  their help in preserving my sense of awe at the world.<br/>\n  This list has done this for me as well.
