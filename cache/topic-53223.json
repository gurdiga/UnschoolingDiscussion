I may be mistaken, but <br/>\ndid someone in this group say that he was in a Robin Hood movie?  I looked at <br/>\nmy library for such a video to no avail.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe plays the sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, a pretty <br/>\nhorrible movie for which we can blame Kevin Costner.  It suggests that Robin <br/>\nHood&#39;s band of men &quot;hid&quot; in the forest by building some sort of Ewok Village <br/>\nup in the trees.  Kind of hard to move your camping spot when you&#39;ve built in <br/>\nthat way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFriends of mine who don&#39;t like it call it &quot;Dances with Saxons,&quot; but I prefer <br/>\n&quot;Robin Hood in the Ewok Village.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I hate it, but here&#39;s another review (from Amazon) from someone who liked <br/>\nit:<br/>\n<br/>\nEditorial Reviews<br/>\nAmazon.com<br/>\nKevin Costner&#39;s lousy English accent is a small obstacle in this often <br/>\nexciting version of the Robin Hood fable. That aside, it&#39;s refreshing to have <br/>\na preface to the old story in which we meet the robber hero of Sherwood <br/>\nForest as a soldier in King Richard&#39;s Crusades, coming home to find his <br/>\npeople under siege from the cruelties of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan <br/>\nRickman). After Robin and his community of outcasts and fighters take to the <br/>\ntrees, director Kevin Reynolds (Fandango, 187) is on more familiar narrative <br/>\nground, and he goes for the gusto with lots of original action (Robin shoots <br/>\ntwo arrows simultaneously from his bow in two directions). Mary Elizabeth <br/>\nMastrantonio, as Marion, makes a convincing damsel in distress, and Morgan <br/>\nFreeman brings dignity to his role as Robin&#39;s Moor friend. Alan Rickman, <br/>\nhowever, gets the most attention for his scene-chewing role as the rotten <br/>\nsheriff, an almost campy performance that is highly entertaining but perhaps <br/>\na little out of sorts with the rest of the film. The DVD release includes <br/>\nproduction notes, theatrical trailers, optional French and Spanish <br/>\nsoundtracks, optional English, French, and Spanish subtitles, widescreen <br/>\npresentation, and Dolby sound. --Tom Keogh</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53213,"nextTopicId":53227}}
