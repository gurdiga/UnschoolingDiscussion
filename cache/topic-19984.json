If you all like walking around towns and such I&#39;d hit NewHope and <br/>\nthen cross the bridge to Jersey......more shops and such (Frenchtown) You <br/>\ncould visit a winery in Bucks County, Buckingham Valley Vineyard they do <br/>\ntours and such. I believe you can get something from the Chamber on covered <br/>\nbridges and go from bridge to bridge, great scenery. Peddlers Village in <br/>\nBucks County is great too. How old are your kids?
