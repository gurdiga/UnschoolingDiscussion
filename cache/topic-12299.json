I am really happy it <br/>\nis working out so well.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just wanted to share our recent interest catalyst.  Yes it was... THE TV.<br/>\n&gt;(g)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Alex (6) surprised me at breakfast the other day by asking me about the<br/>\n&gt;story of Macbeth. Through our ensuing conversation, I learned that there<br/>\n&gt;had been something on Arthur about Macbeth.  Also, this week, the movie<br/>\n&gt;of choice in the house has been Hercules (Disney).  This was being<br/>\n&gt;requested 2 times a day!  Well, it does have great music and some pretty<br/>\n&gt;funny dialog, so I was roped in each viewing.  This led to some of the<br/>\n&gt;following questions from Alex:  Who was Odysseus, who was Pandora (of The<br/>\n&gt;Box fame), what was the Trojan Horse, what is Cerebus.  We looked in the<br/>\n&gt;encyclopedia for some answers and also got books from the library.  There<br/>\n&gt;are some great books for kids about what you would consider &quot;adult<br/>\n&gt;stuff&quot;.  Alex has been reading (or read to) about the adventures of<br/>\n&gt;Odysseus, the Trojan War, and Greek Mythology.  We also got a kick out of<br/>\n&gt;learning the 12 labors of Hercules and then noticing what was made<br/>\n&gt;mention of in the movie.  Also, we got a great book called the Tales of<br/>\n&gt;Shakespeare, which has some of the plays in a sort of comic book lay out.<br/>\n&gt;  Very cool.  Yesterday we read Macbeth and Romeo & Juliet.  Alex really<br/>\n&gt;liked all the fighting and mayhem.  I wanted to cry at the end of R & J.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sorry this was so long, I just thought it was all way too cool.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;~Shelley<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt;Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Addresses:<br/>\n&gt;Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12306,"nextTopicId":12322}}
