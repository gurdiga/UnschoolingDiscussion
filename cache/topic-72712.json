If only she <br/>\ncould see the wonderful things that have come from this unschooling life change.  <br/>\n&lt;sigh&gt;-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the same day I read that we were lazy hedonists, this happened:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe final day, graduation from the Junior Police Academy, they march in like <br/>\nsoldiers, doing face drills and filing in and pledging allegience (we briefed <br/>\nMarty on that this week; he said he knew it from a humorous version in the <br/>\nbathroom, just leave out the joke parts)...<br/>\n<br/>\nCeremonial this&#39;n&#39;that, certificates, pins, Marty was awarded a certificate <br/>\nas &quot;Top Gun&quot; (electronic target practice guns, F.A.T.S. and paintball guns) <br/>\nwhich also came with $15 gift certificate to a sporting goods store.  Seven or <br/>\neight other kids (of 32) got awards like most pushups, most improved, most <br/>\nphysically fit male.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf Marty, I thought &quot;All that Nintendo Duck Hunt paid off.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we ate good local barbecue, served up by their instructors, and as <br/>\npeople were taking pictures and saying goodbye, I went up to one of his instructors <br/>\nand sat to thank him.  He said Marty was just a joy to work with.  Chit chat <br/>\nyou&#39;d expect.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he said the big thing.   (Brace yourselves.   And I really like the guy.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said &quot;You can always tell a kid who comes from a family with discipline, <br/>\nwith rules.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said Marty was really well behaved and enthusiastic and cooperative.  (I <br/>\nwish I had the exact quotes there; I wish I had VIDEOTAPE.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI said &quot;We hardly have any rules at our house.  We just tell them to always <br/>\nmake the best choice, to be helpful and not hurt people.&quot;  (That&#39;s maybe 85% <br/>\nclose to exact words; I need my audio back!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said they had talked about a lot of things like that over the week.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to make light again, because it was maybe kinda tacky to counter <br/>\n&quot;you can always tell&quot; with &quot;GOTCHA!  Wrong!  CAN&#39;T always tell.&quot;  So I said, <br/>\n&quot;Y&#39;know, Monday was really his first day at school of any sort.   It was his first <br/>\nday taking notes or anything like that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh, right, he&#39;s homeschooled, right?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Most of the homeschooled kids I&#39;ve met were not so good at social <br/>\ninteractions.  Marty&#39;s really confident and outgoing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him he had gone home and re-written his notes from Monday, and had <br/>\nbeen really focussed on his assignments and getting ready for the next day.  He <br/>\nsaid &quot;Initiative!  Good!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably there was nobody there who was as eager and excited to be there as <br/>\nMarty was.  So we made some more sweet chitchat and that was it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI could hardly wait to get into the van and close the doors so I could tell <br/>\nKeith, Marty and Holly what he had said about discipline and rules.  We talked <br/>\nabout that most of the way home.  Holly can hardly believe that some people <br/>\nthink that rules upon rules will make people &quot;good&quot; away from home.  It just <br/>\nmakes no sense to her.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMarty said one of the kids got in bad trouble this afternoon, threatened with <br/>\nbeing sent home, for throwing pieces of rubber at other kids, and for <br/>\nthrowing paintballs.  One broke on the exercise track.  NOT at the targets, where the <br/>\nmess was supposed to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarty couldn&#39;t fathom why someone would be at such a cool place and act that <br/>\nway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut Marty had also told me there were two people there who hadn&#39;t even wanted <br/>\nto be there.  I didn&#39;t ask (yet) whether this kid was one of those.  Marty <br/>\nwas exhausted when he got home and went to bed at 10:00.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis evidence is really important, that someone who works with kids a lot <br/>\n(Police Athletic League volunteer), someone who&#39;s in law enforcement, sees an <br/>\nenthusiastic, well-behaved, cooperative kid, and is confident that he came from a <br/>\nhouse with discipline and rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline and rules?   All-fired flaming hedonists?  (Whatever the <br/>\naccusation was.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of the above.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72322,"nextTopicId":72752}}
