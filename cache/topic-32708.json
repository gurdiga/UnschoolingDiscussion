I just","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-68756308\">I have been getting a sensation that there was something about the Holt <br/>\ndiscussion on definitions of unschooling that I was really uncomfortable <br/>\nwith. I just realized what it is. John Holt was a terrific advocate for <br/>\nunschooling and wrote some great books, but ultimately I don&#39;t look to his <br/>\nwork as an authority on what unschooling is. It seems to me that focusing on <br/>\nwhat John did or did not say in his works as a mantra or dogma we should <br/>\nfollow is giving away our own power. I may be fumbling my words here. . . but <br/>\nlet me try again. I have read probably just about everything written on <br/>\nunschooling. .. from a variety of authors. I have participated in many <br/>\ndiscussions in real life and online about unschooling. John&#39;s words and books <br/>\nhave great value but so do many other sources. To rely too heavily on what he <br/>\nsaid or didn&#39;t say seems to fly in the face of what he himself would <br/>\nadvocate. The simplest definition would be the best. I like Lynda&#39;s idea of <br/>\nasking the young people. Because we have such a tremendous influence on them <br/>\nas parents, we will probably find some of our words coming back at us in ways <br/>\nwe never thought of saying them. I think most of us would probably agree that <br/>\nindividual(child) led learning is unschooling in its purest or simplest form. <br/>\nAnthing beyond that is individuals putting their own interpretation of what <br/>\nthat might look like in their own family. Anyway, just some ramblings while I <br/>\ncan&#39;t sleep. I would be anxious to hear what all of the other young people in <br/>\nyour families would say to the question of &quot;what does unschooling mean to <br/>\nyou&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving in Abundance<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32756,"nextTopicId":32785}}
