Zak is watching the Magic School Bus (the <br/>\ndinosaur one) for the 3rd time.  He&#39;s also been doing The Land Before Time <br/>\nMath on his computer for a while.  I&#39;ve offered to do other things with him.  <br/>\nBut no he only wants to do what he wants to do.  He did let me play a game of <br/>\nDinosaur Monopoly when my 2 year old was asleep... So what&#39;s the problem you <br/>\nare asking? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s me... I feel like he ought to be doing more or I ought to be &quot;making&quot; <br/>\nhim do more by offering him more things.  He went to the park this morning <br/>\nfor an hour with his dad and brother, then the grocery store and since then <br/>\nwe&#39;ve been home.  It&#39;s about 96 and hummid outside and he just wants to watch <br/>\nThe Magic School Bus....<br/>\n<br/>\nSo help me let go of this need to want to take control and also the thoughts <br/>\nthat he ought to be &quot;doing&quot; more.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also did some math this morning with DH.  He thinks it&#39;s puzzles and he <br/>\ndid that for about 20 mins.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo some emotional support and support that this is normal and I&#39;ll get used <br/>\nto this and the guilt will go away....<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nDawn Falbe  <br/>\nPersonal Development Coach<br/>\nRelocational Astrologer<br/>\n(520) 579-2646<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nThe Path of Least Resistance is Inside of You<br/>\nwww.astrologerdawn.com<br/>\nEnlightening women on how to live their Soul Purpose<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The people who get on in this world<br/>\n are people who get up and look for the<br/>\n circumstances they want, and, <br/>\nif they can&#39;t find them, make them.&quot; - George Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school.&quot;-George <br/>\nBernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25995,"nextTopicId":26021}}
