I have seven and 15 year old boys. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I&#39;m a *little* tired of The Simpson&#39;s Halloween DVD we just got two <br/>\ndays ago! I enjoyed it the first 12-15 times!  But over and over and over and <br/>\nover...*I* know more than half the lines by now! And even though we spent five <br/>\nhours at the fair yesterday, I was reciting Simpsons in my DREAMS last night! <br/>\nI may ban the sucker today!   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, after these last two days, I&#39;ll venture to say that I *may* do some <br/>\nrestricting! &lt;g&gt; Can we watch Cat-Dog or Cow and Chicken or Ed, Edd, & <br/>\nEddie----PLEEEEEEEEEASE?????<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think I can work toward trusting him, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>knowing he will choose content that he finds compelling and therefore is not <br/>\n&quot;trash&quot; (even Power Rangers -- that&#39;s a new one for us and my ex-teacher self <br/>\nis <br/>\nsilently struggling with that), but are there any pitfalls with that attitude <br/>\nthat I need to be aware of? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSee above! &lt;BWG&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As far as bedtime goes, do most of you just let your kids sleep when <br/>\n </span></blockquote>they&#39;re <br/>\ntired?  (Gee, it sounds so sensible when I put it that way. &lt;g&gt;)  It&#39;s a <br/>\nbeautiful night and I love the idea of Fisher being able to enjoy it with me <br/>\n(I&#39;m a <br/>\nnight walker) . . . but I also get kind of an icky feeling when we get in the <br/>\nhabit of sleeping late in the morning.  I hate to miss the beautiful early <br/>\nmorning hours, and I guess years of socialization has taught me to feel lazy <br/>\nwhen I (or my son) sleep in.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you think naps were invented? I&#39;m up early. I often go to bed <br/>\nlate---although sometimes I crawl in @ 8:00. Just depends on how tired I am. I&#39;m a big <br/>\nbeliever in naps. Forced naps are rough----you learn to avoid naps AT ALL <br/>\nCOST! Both my boys will go to bed in the middle of the afternoon if they are <br/>\ntired. It&#39;s not a punishment----and THEY know when they are tired. And they see me <br/>\nnap a lot. I think it&#39;s natural. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82446,"nextTopicId":24673}}
