It&#39;s a  continuum.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy entry to the parenting continuum/cycle is from loving, mindful  <br/>\nconsideration of their feelings and comfort, and the knowledge that  they can learn from <br/>\nplaying.

They never even heard of  the discussion.<br/>\n <br/>\nToday I was telling Kirby about a letter I got (on paper, not e-mail,  so I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t just forward it to him) thanking our whole family for  helping the <br/>\nauthor&#39;s family live more peacefully.

We did it nicely, we explained the situation, we sympathized <br/>\nwith her not wanting to go and leave her new friends, but we didn&#39;t let <br/>\nher reticence be the deciding factor that made us miss our plane. We <br/>\ndid NOT open up the decision to all possibilities and we didn&#39;t offer <br/>\nour theories and work on creative problem solving until we could come <br/>\nto a mutually agreeable solution. We, the two adults in the situation, <br/>\nwho knew and understood what the repercussions would be of any or all <br/>\nof us missing that plane, put our greater understanding and information <br/>\nabove her immediate desire to stay with her two new friends (who were <br/>\nhysterically crying and hanging on to her and making it nearly <br/>\nimpossible for Holly to think clearly enough to make a reasonable <br/>\ndecision even within her limited understand and information).<br/>\n<br/>\nThese would be unacceptable behaviors to NCPers. I&#39;m just not willing <br/>\nto go as far as they do - so I&#39;m NOT saying that NCP is the same as the <br/>\nkind of trusting unschooling that we talk about here.<br/>\n<br/>\nNCP says that when a mutually-acceptable solution can&#39;t be found, the <br/>\npriority becomes &quot;not coercing the child.&quot; I understand the reasoning. <br/>\nI think it sounds great in theory and that its one huge big <br/>\n(theoretical) error is not accounting for the unfortunate reality of <br/>\ntime constraints and that its secondary error is not accounting <br/>\nadequately for differences in parents and children in ability to <br/>\nunderstand consequences and to comprehend information.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot coercing is &quot;a&quot; priority for me, but not the ultimate priority.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also thought there was a small amount of hypocrisy evident - or maybe <br/>\ndouble-talk. For example, if a young child runs into the street and is <br/>\nabout to be hit by a car, TCS/NCP people didn&#39;t have a problem with <br/>\nsomebody else swooping them up and out of harm&#39;s way. Their reasoning <br/>\nwas that the child didn&#39;t want to be hit by a car so this doesn&#39;t count <br/>\nas coercion.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - the argument is that if the child really understood he/she was <br/>\nabout to be hit by a car, he/she would want to be moved.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis argument could be used for anything - I could say that if Holly <br/>\nreally understood the repercussions of us missing our plane, she would <br/>\nhave wanted us to make it. I could say that if my 2 year old really <br/>\nunderstood the repercussions of her dancing on the neighbor&#39;s coffee <br/>\ntable, she&#39;d want to be stopped.
