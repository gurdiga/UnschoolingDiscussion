I feel like since he doesn&#39;t go to school, maybe he should be in some classes.  So I signed him up for a tumbling for tots class, the description of the class sounded great.  I thought he would run around, do obsticle courses, socialize with the other kids and maybe learn to do somersaults.  Boy was I wrong!  He spend most of the class sitting with his back against the wall waiting for his turn.  Ok, actually, he didn&#39;t, the rest of the kids did, but he refused and instead sat on my lap.  The instructor actually yelled at him for not sitting with the other kids.  We left.  It was everything I hate about school and the whole reason I&#39;m not sending him to school.  The instructor actually told one girl that she couldn&#39;t go to the bathroom, she would have to wait until class was over.  And this was a fun class.  Yikes!  So, I think now when I get guilt about the taking classes thing, I will remember this one and hopefully decide he is better off without them.<br/>\nChristy<br/>\n Betsy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ecsamhill@...\">ecsamhill@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n**There&#39;s too many cars<br/>\nfor them to go<br/>\nbiking in the street so they don&#39;t have the freedom I had as a child :-(**<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest taking your kids someplace where they can go biking,<br/>\ninstead of a class.

Even my <br/>\noldest in school doesn&#39;t like the whole sports or club scene. She likes to <br/>\ncome and go as she pleases and the younger 2 of the 3 so far seem to be the <br/>\nsame way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son when he was 5 wanted to do T-ball. My husband and I were coach and <br/>\nteam mom so we could closely watch the goings on there. He had fun but by <br/>\nthe end of the season was really tired of &quot;having&quot; to be somewhere at a <br/>\ncertain time on a certain day. Now the middle two are 8 as of Sat. and soon <br/>\nto be 7 in 4 weeks. The only thing they do on a regualar basis is a <br/>\nhomeschooling sports camp every Friday at the park for 3 hours. That runs <br/>\nevery week from Sept. until May. We have two regular park days once a month. <br/>\nOne we run ourselves so we are always there, the other one is up for grabs <br/>\ndepending on weather and how the kids feel. Other than that, nothing <br/>\norganized. The field trips we do are at our choice. Sometimes 5 a month, <br/>\nsometimes none. Everything else is spur of the moment. Aside from about 3 <br/>\nother families I know that homeschool, we are unusual in what we don&#39;t do. I <br/>\nmust also add that when something comes up, I always explain to the kids <br/>\nwhat it is and what will be expected and let them decide. If they get to <br/>\nwher they want to do more organized stuff, we would be happy to oblige. My 8 <br/>\nyear old has actually just asked to join an organized soccer team, <br/>\nunfortunately it&#39;s not soccer season now and he&#39;ll have to wait.

Compared to everyone else I know my kids are not in enough,  (their opinion)  my daughter (8) is in a gymnastics class and girl scouts.  My son (9) is in a science club. My youngest daughter(5) isn&#39;t in any.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think for our family its been up to them,  and alot of times they don&#39;t want to be in classes.  When I go through,  &quot;They aren&#39;t doing enough&quot;  and I suggest some, they just kind-of shake their heads and say they want to do stuff at home or other things.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe cost thing is definitely an issue too,  for us the science club is very low priced and so is girl scouts,  but the gymnastics is pretty costly.   This is her first and I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll continue through out or not.<br/>\n <br/>\nI guess what really bothers me about classes is when its the parents who want to be there more than the kids. <br/>\n <br/>\n  Some moms I know used to say &quot;its my social time&quot;  that pretty much made me sick,  especially when the kids were sooo over scheduled that they didn&#39;t know which way was up.   <br/>\n <br/>\n  I remember being at swimming lessons a few years ago and I was soo proud to be at a lesson, (ha!) and I&#39;m talking with another mom and she tells me that this was her kids second activity and they still had one more to go to!  And this was only in the morning?     Insane,  in my opinion.  And this was summer,  supposed to be the kids vacation?????<br/>\n <br/>\nI suppose a certain level of activity is healthy and good,  but isn&#39;t that up to the child?   I don&#39;t think you should feel guiltied into putting the kids into classes.   Also when they are younger isn&#39;t it more the kids getting together with other kids?  You can do that with friends,  and from some earlier posts by you, you&#39;ve indicated that you are attempting to do that!<br/>\n <br/>\nFrom my point of view I think you are worrying needlessly,   <br/>\n <br/>\nOn the whole environment thing,  is there a Y?   a community center? or a university?  In our town we don&#39;t have a Y, but our university has some activities that they hold that are very reasonably priced, some free.<br/>\n <br/>\nHope I&#39;ve helped!<br/>\n <br/>\nKelli<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Shyrley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shyrley.williams@...\">shyrley.williams@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking about &#39;classes&#39; recently, mainly cos a lot of people here sign their kids up for 4 or 5 classes a week.
