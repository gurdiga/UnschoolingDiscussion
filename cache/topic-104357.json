Julian got the sickest, with a fever of 103.5 at one  <br/>\npoint. Pain in the butt, unpleasant, but...<br/>\n <br/>\nJulian is 15, and pretty independent. One of the sweetest things this week  <br/>\nhas been that I got to take care of this very big boy. I brought him juice and  <br/>\ntasty foods to nibble on, medicine and the tv remote. I covered him up in a  <br/>\ncomforter, and took his temp and brought him a cool washcloth. When he was  <br/>\nfeeling particularly awful, he snuggled into me on the couch and fell  asleep.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s hard when your kid feels so sick, but so nice to be able to take care  <br/>\nof him.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20189,"nextTopicId":104358}}
