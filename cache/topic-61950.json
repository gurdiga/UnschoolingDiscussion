If you have a VCR, maybe you can record one and watch another.  <br/>\n  That&#39;s what we used to do when kids were little and we only had one TV.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I agree with Sandra. If the kids each have favorites, try to find a way, hopefully that they both can watch them. We have 4 tv&#39;s here and still the kids occasionally have a squabble over the tv. Mostly because they all like to watch in the playroom. With me though, I just try and send one somewhere else to watch. Once in awhile, one child will go into the playroom to watch tv and one other one will follow just because. Then that 2nd person wants control over the remote. I make sure that the first person to go in to specifically watch tv is the one that gets the remote. Seems only fair because it was their idea first. We don&#39;t have time limits either as no one child here really has a favorite show that they can&#39;t miss. Generally if Joseph has had enough of Animal Planet, he&#39;ll get up and go play. If we only had one tv and Sierra had been watching for an hour or so, I would try to make a compromise so the other one who isn&#39;t interested can have some time with something different.<br/>\n  With the computer, we have 2 hear. One in the library/computer room and one in Joseph&#39;s room. Joseph doesn&#39;t have internet access yet as he hasn&#39;t cleaned his room from all the stuff so Joe can get in there to hook it up!!! Whoever gets on or asks for the computer first has it until they want off. My kids are good as they usually watch the other one and more times than not, the first one on will ask the other if they want a turn to play. The less fuss you make about it, and be matter of fact and show concern for both, the quicker the kids will work out something on their own too.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] plug in drug","postDate":"1048642803","msgId":62036,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkOS41ZWM3YmE0LjJiYjI1ZWYzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":62035,"nextInTopic":62041,"prevInTime":62035,"nextInTime":62037,"topicId":61950,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/25/03 6:26:08 PM, nellebelle@charter.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1511481165\">In a message dated 3/25/03 6:26:08 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nellebelle@...\">nellebelle@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  But later in her book she<br/>\n<br/>\nsays that mothers have to entice their young children to watch TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently, very young children somehow sense that TV is not real, so they<br/>\n<br/>\nhave to be taught how to watch it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s very strange.<br/>\nEspecially if she thinks it&#39;s addictive, why would a mother &quot;entice&quot; them any <br/>\nmore than she would get them training-cocaine or blow cigarette smoke into <br/>\ntheir noses?  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the idea that children wouldn&#39;t look at moving pictures with music and <br/>\nfunny voices makes me think maybe the woman is from another planet, or very <br/>\nold.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and I watched a DVD of old Howdy Doody shows.

My three year old wanted to join them, which meant that I needed to go out also to monitor him near the street.

They turn into little <br/>\nzombies and I can&#39;t get anyones attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is your job that is made harder by having tv in your home?  &quot;Little zombies&quot; is a pretty disrespectful term.  I think what you mean is they are interested and absorbed.  I don&#39;t watch much tv, but I do spend a fair amount of time on the computer, and if the conversation is good I might appear totally absorbed in the screen.  I&#39;d be highly offended if my husband got rid of my computer and then announced that he had to do it because it turned his wife into a &quot;little zombie.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you feel the same way if you had a child who loved to read and got so absorbed in his/her book that you couldn&#39;t get his/her attention easily?  Would you feel that you had to get rid of all reading material so their attention was always easily gotten?  <br/>\n<br/>\nPatti</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62504,"nextTopicId":62420}}
