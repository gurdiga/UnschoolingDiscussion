He was escalating.  You endured a flood of abuse <br/>\nquietly.  You caused your daughter to have to suffer it too.  That&#39;s not <br/>\npsychoanalysis.<br/>\n<br/>\nA mom at a homeschooling activity here a year and some ago let her son hit <br/>\nand kick her and didn&#39;t say a word, didn&#39;t even look at him, just kept on with <br/>\nher conversation with other moms.   He had hit me just moments before that.   <br/>\nAccidently?  Could&#39;ve been claimed, except for the dirty knowing look he gave <br/>\nme when I said &quot;Don&#39;t hit me.&quot;   A homeschooling group dissolved over people&#39;s <br/>\ninability to deal with that boy and his mother&#39;s oblivion.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mother, by ignoring him, while he was hitting her in front of eight or <br/>\nten moms and 20 kids, gave him the clear message that hitting was okay with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might have made her feel good to think that by ignoring it she wasn&#39;t <br/>\nmaking it powerful, but she was enabling him to continue and to feel justified and <br/>\npermitted.

I did not ask for advice, suggestions or solutions. <br/>\n  I know that posting on a public group is an open invitation for others to <br/>\noffer these types of responses, but, just to reiterate, I did not ask for <br/>\nanyone&#39;s &quot;help&quot;.    I did ask for alternatives to handling these types of <br/>\nsituations when folks came on with thier psychoanalysis of my parenting and my <br/>\nrelationship with my son.  <br/>\n<br/>\n   I really appreciate the other folks who have contributed thier own <br/>\nexperiences and how they deal with explosive anger.  I know there are kids with this <br/>\ntype of personalities/dispositions.    For some children, it may be excessive <br/>\ncrying, it may be flailing around, kicking and screaming, it may be verbal, <br/>\ncursing, threatening.   For the folks who seem so appalled at the harsh <br/>\nlanguage.   I find that a bit funny.   Words like f&#39;ing b***. , coming from an enraged <br/>\nchild who is out of control, are no more abusive to me child getting mad and <br/>\nholding thier breath.  It is just a different means of communicating.. I AM <br/>\nANGRY.    Do you not agree that the more  alarm, reaction, &quot;boundaries&quot; I set, <br/>\nin response to harsh language, the more powerful it becomes to him?<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8151304,"authorName":"rubyprincesstsg@aol.com","from":"rubyprincesstsg@...","profile":"rubyprincesstsg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: unschooling sibling relationships","postDate":"1063504661","msgId":80424,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2Mi4yNThjNTFlZS4yYzk1MjUxNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":80423,"nextInTopic":80425,"prevInTime":80423,"nextInTime":80425,"topicId":80380,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/13/2003 8:40:24 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

So, in the past, I would either remove myself from the child&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;presence, and let them know I have done nothing to be treated like this, and when <br/>\n&gt;they are ready to talk to me the way I speak to them, they can come and sit <br/>\n&gt;with me and we&#39;ll talk.  If they continue to harass, I completely ignore them.  <br/>\n&gt;Pretend they&#39;re not even there.  Or, if I was in the middle of something, they <br/>\n&gt;would have to leave the room, go upstairs, go outside...think about <br/>\n&gt;things...but remove themselves from my presence.  Same situation if they are harassing <br/>\n&gt;another child or sibling.  It really worked for us.  When the kid is ready to <br/>\n&gt;talk about things in a decent, kind way, they&#39;re welcomed back with open arms, <br/>\n&gt;the situation is resolved, everyone is happy.  But like others have said, no <br/>\n&gt;one deserves to be treated like s**t.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get other solutions, but this worked for us.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Nancy B. in WV<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, I ignore it myself as long as no-one is being hurt.

If I have to do some running around I try to wait until my husband is home and just ask who wants to come.

Once they lose control of their frustration","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1761712811\">&lt;&lt;I have found the best way to deal with these outrages is to wait <br/>\nthem out.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is what I have found as well. Once they lose control of their frustration and/or anger, I&#39;ve found they recover the quickest by me waiting it out.  I have found the best thing I can do for them at that point is to minimize any additional external stimuli - it just sends them back over the edge.  I have found that any talking, touching, environment changes (even changing the lighting, or me changing position in the room standing to standing etc.) often gets them worked up again until the episode has completely passed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids recognize this as well.  In fact, if my husband tries to reason with Alyssa (9) when she is close to or over &quot;the edge&quot;, one of my sons (6 and 11) will often recognize the situation and remind him not to speak to her right now, that she&#39;ll just get more upset.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvice?  Well, I can just tell you what I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talk with the kids about this regularly - when they are calm.  We talk about trying to notice when they are getting overly frustrated or angry, the things they can do to try to calm down, reasonable ways to express their anger, ways they can work out a compromise with each other (if they are getting angry with someone else over something), and I ask what they would like me to do to help when they feel that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy eldest son Joseph asked me to point the situation out to him and gently suggest he spend some quiet time in his room to calm down - but he made a point of telling me that I should not express any frustration with him even in my tone of voice or body language.  Alyssa says she wants me to stay with her but do nothing (i.e. no talking, touching etc. - she is the most sensitive to any movement when she has lost control).  My youngest Michael is a silent rager, which is easier on the ears but is turning out to be just as difficult work with.  He hasn&#39;t yet been able to tell me much about what I can do to help him out so I just keep trying different things.  These aren&#39;t long, complete conversations - they don&#39;t have patience or interest for that - but shorter ones, especially as they relate/connect to things that come up during the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also work hard to recognize when they getting close to their tolerance level or breaking point for frustration/anger... and that is a moving target based on the situation and environment.  When I see them getting frustrated or angry I evaluate the situation and see if there&#39;s something I can do to help before it gets out of control: offer some food or a new/quiet activity (alone or with me), help work out compromise or offer help with whatever&#39;s causing the frustration (look up a game guide, hold the paper etc.), or leave the environment entirely (like a crowded or noisy function etc.).  I also try to connect with the child and talk with him/her right away about how I can see they are getting frustrated so they can label what they&#39;re feeling and I&#39;ll go through with them the stuff we&#39;ve talked about before to help them calm down or work it out.  But sometimes it doesn&#39;t work, or the rage comes seemingly out-of-the-blue with practically no visible warning signs.  When that happens I create the best environment I can for them until they calm down.  And later calmly talk again ... and again ... and again.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my kids we&#39;ve found that usually the best environment is in their room - a comfortable, familiar place with no additional stimuli to keep pushing them over the edge.  If we&#39;re not home, like in the car, we all know not to say or do anything (i.e. no more external stimuli) and I&#39;ll try to put a distracting,soothing CD in - one that the particular child enjoys, while he/she calms down.  What works for helping them come out of a rage is particular to each child.  This you&#39;ll need to find by trying different things out and by asking them later what they think you could do to help them.  But don&#39;t invest yourself in that as the final solution!  You may find yourself saying after next time - &quot;I tried to do that but it didn&#39;t seem to help you, what else can you think of?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am seeing that the cumulative effort of many shorter conversations along with maturity and experience as they get older seems to be helping.  Joseph has pretty much learned how to handle himself when he gets really frustrated or angry so he very rarely goes over the edge and rages.  He can usually catch himself and he moves on to another room or activity until the frustration/anger subsides.  Alyssa also loses control less and less frequently now as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, it has also helped me to realize this is just part of their personality/makeup.  I remember that since they were babies they have always had a certain tolerance level for things and past that they lost control.  I have always strived to minimize situations where they would approach their tolerance level and if it happened, comfort them the best I could to help them regain control as quickly and painlessly as possible.  And as they get older, to help them learn how to recognize these situations, head them off, or regain control for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":42924764,"authorName":"Marjorie Kirk","from":"&quot;Marjorie Kirk&quot; &lt;mkirk@...&gt;","profile":"mdlfkirk","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] unschooling sibling relationships","postDate":"1063472600","msgId":80399,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjIwMWMzN2ExOCRlZWY1NDEwMCQ2NjAxYThjMEBlbWFjaGluZT4=","referencesHeader":"PDE3ZC4yMDQyM2E2ZS4yYzk0OGZlMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":80398,"nextInTopic":80400,"prevInTime":80398,"nextInTime":80400,"topicId":80380,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... the ... child s ... and when ... sit ... them. ... they ... are harassing ... to ... arms, ... no ...

And, as I said earlier, sometimes <br/>\nit&#39;s a matter of age, maturity.. the older a child gets, the more they can <br/>\nunderstand thier own body signals and the better a code word, or a gentle <br/>\nencouragement to calm down can help.    At almost 17, Landon has not had an <br/>\noutrageous epidsode since he was about 13.. At at that time, he had a lot of stress and <br/>\nmitigating factors going on in his life to perpetuate his frustration.   <br/>\nLandon does not cuss at me, he would NEVER dream of hitting me.  He is polite and <br/>\nwell adjusted.   Sometimes he is appalled at JP&#39;s behavior, but with a little <br/>\nreminder, he remembers that he used the behave very much the same way.  At <br/>\nalmost 12, Ethan rarely blows up.. He does still occasionally lose control, but <br/>\nvery less often that say, a year ago.   JP is now 8 and he seems to be hitting <br/>\nhis peak for explosive behavior.    He will be fine.   He will learn to work <br/>\nthrough his overwhelming emotions and find better ways to deal with frustration <br/>\n( with my support, of course) <br/>\n<br/>\nNancy in BW talked about how she deals with foster children who exhibit these <br/>\ntypes of behaviors.   I agree, lots of kids with emotional issues come from <br/>\nbroken homes, abusive situations,  it&#39;s the only way they know to relate to <br/>\nothers.    My children have never been abused.  My family , even my extended <br/>\nfamily to Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, are all very close, loving..  Two <br/>\nof my nephews ( my sisters son and my bil and sil son..) are also very high <br/>\nstrung with volitile tempers.

How does she do this?  <br/>\nHow would others recommend a remedy for this situation?  When things have gone <br/>\nthis far (I&#39;ve seen it with a friend) it&#39;s hard to turn around.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll give my 2 cents, and some may not agree with it.  I&#39;ve had to deal with <br/>\nfoster children who came to us out of control with no respect, especially for <br/>\nme, problems with respect for women.  I&#39;ve been told I&#39;m a f***ing b**ch, <br/>\nwhore, I&#39;ve been told they want to kill me, hit, bit....LOL...the whole gamit!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, the natural thing that happens in life when someone treats another <br/>\nlike crap, is those people no longer want to be around or spend time with the <br/>\nperpetrator.  So, in the past, I would either remove myself from the child&#39;s <br/>\npresence, and let them know I have done nothing to be treated like this, and when <br/>\nthey are ready to talk to me the way I speak to them, they can come and sit <br/>\nwith me and we&#39;ll talk.  If they continue to harass, I completely ignore them.  <br/>\nPretend they&#39;re not even there.  Or, if I was in the middle of something, they <br/>\nwould have to leave the room, go upstairs, go outside...think about <br/>\nthings...but remove themselves from my presence.  Same situation if they are harassing <br/>\nanother child or sibling.  It really worked for us.  When the kid is ready to <br/>\ntalk about things in a decent, kind way, they&#39;re welcomed back with open arms, <br/>\nthe situation is resolved, everyone is happy.  But like others have said, no <br/>\none deserves to be treated like s**t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get other solutions, but this worked for us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":158112576,"authorName":"Teresa","from":"&quot;Teresa&quot; &lt;TeresaBnNC@...&gt;","profile":"tbb1967","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: unschooling sibling relationships","postDate":"1063461645","msgId":80386,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJqdjd1ZCsycGJ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDMwOTEzLjA2MjkwNC4yNDIzNC4xMzExMzVAd2VibWFpbDE3Lm55Yy51bnRkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":80385,"nextInTopic":80391,"prevInTime":80385,"nextInTime":80387,"topicId":80380,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There are ways to protect YOU from abuse while not being punitive with the frustrated person.
