My daughter just had her first &quot;date&quot; on Monday.  She is 14 (nearly 15 she <br/>\nwould add) and her, her best girlfriend and their &quot;boyfriends&quot; went to see a <br/>\nmovie here in town.  She&#39;s been plenty of times to the movies with boys/girls <br/>\nbut none that she considered an actual boyfriend in a romantic way.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou would think being the fourth child, second daughter I&#39;d have this dating <br/>\nthing figured out, but I still hold my breath.  Not so much for fear of what <br/>\nmight happen sexually, because we talk about that often.  More so now that she <br/>\nhas a girlfriend she&#39;s known since preschool who is having sex and it&#39;s <br/>\ncausing big problems in her life.  More of the fear is just the average run of the <br/>\nmill mother fear of broken hearts, car accidents, (watching her drive away with <br/>\na teenage driver nearly stopped my heart but I smiled and waved as they drove <br/>\nout of sight) and not being able to completely protect her from whatever is <br/>\nout there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if that &quot;whatever&quot; was really out there, I&#39;d have encountered it long <br/>\nago, but it&#39;s just that motherly instinct to protect our own that kicks into <br/>\nhigh gear I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boy was nice enough, she&#39;s &quot;known&quot; him for a while through her friends <br/>\nmother but this was the first time we&#39;ve met him.  First impression was good, he <br/>\nstayed around awhile before they left and he talked, was very pleasant.  I <br/>\nthink Cait breathed a sigh of relief when her 18 year old brother finally got up <br/>\nfrom between them and headed back downstairs.  I guess that was his &quot;mark of <br/>\napproval&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere it&#39;s not so much the parents that a boy would be concerned about meeting <br/>\nand getting to know, it&#39;s the brothers and sister, they are TOUGH.  Maybe <br/>\nbecause she&#39;s the youngest?  Maybe because she&#39;s so trusting?  I know they think <br/>\nshe&#39;s &quot;babied&quot; because she&#39;s not in school around all the &quot;bad stuff&quot; to know <br/>\nwhat goes on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll went well on her date and after the movie he dropped her off at the <br/>\nbaseball field where we were, they hugged and he left.  Wasn&#39;t a good place to have <br/>\nsuch a giddy conversation as mother and daughter discussing a first date.<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t wait to get home but it was big moment on the ball field.  So I <br/>\nhad to wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got home, we went to my room and talked about her first date.  I <br/>\nthink I was as giddy as she was.  How exciting is it?  The best part is that DAD, <br/>\never the stick in the mud and overly protective about Cait handled it all just <br/>\nas I had hoped he would and she thanked me for that, but I really had nothing <br/>\nto do with it.  I guess he is finally catching on that life is not about <br/>\nbattles and confrontations and little girls DO grow up, no matter how much their <br/>\nfathers wish they didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t it exciting and scary to be the mother or a young teenager?  Such <br/>\nwonderful adventures lay ahead for our daughters, and our sons too of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like some advice on helping hurting hearts of young ones in love.  <br/>\nWith my oldest, all I could seem to muster was allowing them a day or two to <br/>\n&quot;wallow&quot; in it, comfort them, make them feel loved and then it was time for a <br/>\nparty.  At first Sarah thought I was insane but I insisted a party was in order <br/>\nbecause now that this particularly bad for her person was out of her life, it <br/>\nmeant she could now have something MORE wonderful just around the corner and <br/>\nthat was cause for celebration!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not so sure that&#39;s the best way to handle it but it seems to work.  <br/>\nEspecially with my oldest, she can sometimes dwell on things that can&#39;t be changed <br/>\nand blame herself and the party does often remind her that she IS loved by <br/>\nMANY friends and family.  It reinforces there is joy in the world and fun to be <br/>\nhad and who knows who is waiting to meet her.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a mother is great isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Boys and Girls","postDate":"1054139365","msgId":71120,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyLjM4ZWVmODA4LjJjMDYzZGU1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":71116,"nextInTopic":71128,"prevInTime":71119,"nextInTime":71121,"topicId":71059,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/28/03 9:56:59 AM, jmcseals@msn.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-737505996\">In a message dated 5/28/03 9:56:59 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmcseals@...\">jmcseals@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;I&#39;d write and then re-write a note to the owners explaining what<br/>\nhappened.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been doing just that.

I think once she understood that I <br/>\nwas worried, she felt much better about being open with me.  I was able to <br/>\nshare some of my own experiences with her and mistakes I had made.  We <br/>\ntalked about friendships and boyfriend/girlfriend relationships and broken <br/>\nhearts, hormones, sex, pregnancy, STD&#39;s....all things we have discussed <br/>\nbefore but had much more relevance this time.  It was a good conversation <br/>\nfor both of us.  She asked a lot of questions and we worked through a lot of <br/>\nscenarios and answers together, rather than me just giving her yes and no <br/>\nanswers.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Hey, you could go to camp with her and make a point to meet this boy<br/>\nand talk to him. Embarrassing for her but if he wants to be around<br/>\nher...well? It&#39;s very hard to address this because he does live far<br/>\naway.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe met Scott when we took her to camp.  I really liked him!  He and my <br/>\nhusband talked car audio stuff and he very kindly greeted Haleigh when he <br/>\nwalked up.  My first impression was *very* good, which helps a lot!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Fighting with teachers is common. My 17yo P.Sch. stepson has<br/>\ngotten into it with one or two teachers. He&#39;s not a bad kid; he just<br/>\ngoofs off too much and they finally get enough of him...but he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t physically fight. I wonder more about his situtation?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said he did something or said something (wasn&#39;t sure which) and the <br/>\nteacher slammed the door in his face.  He then popped off with some comment <br/>\nthat didn&#39;t go over well. She said he told her it just sort of slipped on <br/>\naccident.  Sounded reasonable to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your suggestions!  I wrote a reply last night but my computer <br/>\nshut down just as I was ready to send.

Since she was alone (most everyone <br/>\nhad siblings or long time friends with them. she was to share a tent with <br/>\nthe owner and an older teenage girl.  As luck would have it, it began <br/>\nraining and hailing around 11pm.  They have a shed-type building with a <br/>\nlarge covered patio area.  Everyone grabbed their sleeping bags an slept <br/>\nunder the covered patio.  Everyone except Haleigh (12) and a 14 yr old boy.  <br/>\nThey slept in the shed.  She said the doors were open out to where everyone <br/>\nelse was sleeping.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried not to let my head run wild but it really bothered me.  I casually <br/>\nasked some questions and it sounded like it was no big deal so I did my best <br/>\nto put it out of my mind, though I was and still am bothered that the owner <br/>\nwould have allowed that without my permission or bothering to tell me <br/>\nafterwards.  Haleigh said they didn&#39;t exchange numbers or anything so it <br/>\nreally didn&#39;t seem to be a big deal at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, today I was looking for a real estate agents number I had dialed on my <br/>\ncell phone and came across a number I didn&#39;t recognize.  When I asked <br/>\nHaleigh about it, she said it was this boy&#39;s number and she had called him.  <br/>\nTwice.  We talked about her lying to me and telling me she didn&#39;t exchange <br/>\nnumbers with him.  I didn&#39;t really feel good about it afterwards though.  <br/>\nShe seemed to dismiss everything I was saying like it was no big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw that she tried to call him today and told her that he was probably in <br/>\nschool.  She said he was suspended for fighting with his teacher.  She said <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t know more than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now I&#39;m really bothered.  My husband is freaking out about them staying <br/>\nin the shed together.  I told him I wasn&#39;t worried about them having sex, <br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t feel like Haleigh was &#39;there&#39; at all.  His reply was that I <br/>\nobviously know nothing about 14 year old boys, especially public schooled <br/>\nboys on suspension.  He thinks this boy is BAD news.<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe to say that now I am doing everything in my power not to lose my mind.  <br/>\nI want to be level headed about it but I&#39;m feeling a though I can&#39;t trust <br/>\nher now.  This camp is a monthy camp and she wants to go back next month.  <br/>\nNow I don&#39;t even want her to go.  Am I wrong?  I don&#39;t even know where to <br/>\nbegin in trying to handle this situation.    I don&#39;t want to be way too <br/>\noverprotective but at the same time, I don&#39;t want to be naive and put her in <br/>\na dangerous situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need a gentle helping hand here.
