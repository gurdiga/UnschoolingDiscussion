They said <br/>\nit deteriorated, got more mature (i.e. sexual reference) and less fun, too <br/>\ncrowded.  But...<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night there was a party here.   One of the regulars was missing.  <br/>\n&quot;Is Sadie coming?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;She&#39;s still in Germany.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Oh, right!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I seemed to be the only one who didn&#39;t know she was in Germany.  Why?  <br/>\nVisiting a guy they all knew from playing AoN.  Kirby met him online about four <br/>\nyears ago, they said, and liked him, and so he got to interacting regularly <br/>\nwith Brett, Marty and Sadie.  He&#39;s American, has joined the service ands <br/>\nstationed in Germany.  Sa<br/>\nZdie wanted an excuse to visit Germany anyway, so cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s been playing Halo II.   That&#39;s not so cheap.  Kirby and Marty already <br/>\nhad arranged for DSL and the game itself.  Kirby bought the XBox a couple of <br/>\nyears ago, I guess.  Holly only had to buy her own headset and pay $50 for a <br/>\nyear of online.  Keith and I paid for her subscription, because she needed <br/>\nsomething engrossing and distracting so she would stop telling us &quot;I&#39;m going to <br/>\nENGLAND!&quot; three or five times a day.  Time was crawling by for her before, but <br/>\nnow she&#39;s making friends all over the place, learning a LOT of geography and <br/>\nhistory from it (one was in Canterbury, one is in New Zealand, she was on a team <br/>\nthe other night with four Brits and a few other Americans, against a <br/>\nFrench-speaking team; she has a friend in Arkansas and she&#39;s trying to learn his <br/>\naccent &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":124797388,"authorName":"Melissa Watts","from":"Melissa Watts &lt;melissawatts@...&gt;","profile":"mwatts0","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Need help finding on-line RPGs","postDate":"1113769442","msgId":105394,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyNjJDNUUyLjYwMzA2MDJAdXNmYW1pbHkubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDExMTM1NTg3NjQuNzAwLjg5NzEubTE3QHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDAyYTMwMWM1NDFkZiRmMzQyYTIzMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBCcmVuZGE+"},"prevInTopic":105343,"nextInTopic":105396,"prevInTime":105393,"nextInTime":105395,"topicId":105317,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t play these myself, but my 12 yo says to try Runescape: www.runescape.com Melissa ...
