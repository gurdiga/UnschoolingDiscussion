After reading these various books I thought  I<br/>\n&gt; *got it*. But reading this list has me convinced that I don&#39;t. I<br/>\n&gt; understood &quot;unschooling&quot; to be child-led, not child-controlled. I thought<br/>\n&gt; that unschooling was a way to do away with the mainstream&#39;s way of<br/>\n&gt; pigeonholing children into a particular set of standards and learning<br/>\n&gt; methods, only to find out that there are the militant unschoolers that<br/>\n&gt; say there is only one way of unschooling.  I thought unschooling involved<br/>\n&gt; giving your children all the resources they need to accomplish what they<br/>\n&gt; want, whether it be textbooks, videos, pots and pans, whatever. I guess<br/>\n&gt; my question is, can bits and pieces of mainstream educational methods be<br/>\n&gt; used, if at the leading of the child or the suggestion of the parent, and<br/>\n&gt; this still come under the definition of unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wende,<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, welcome to the list.  I hope that you&#39;ll hang out for awhile; every<br/>\nlist has its off-days and this one&#39;s been tense lately, but there&#39;s still<br/>\ngood stuff here.  Lots of it.  Just delete, or scan fast on digest mode.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my opinion on unschooling your girls right now: you don&#39;t have to get<br/>\nit.  You already have the patience to be a good unschooler -- you&#39;ve<br/>\nconfessed to a &quot;sporadic lifestyle&quot;.  I love that description!  You&#39;ve<br/>\nprobably been unschooling your children anyway -- letting them play,<br/>\nexplore, create, invent, and all that.  Taking trips, going on picnics (even<br/>\nif they&#39;re only in the living room because it&#39;s too cold outside!), visiting<br/>\nthe library, reading books, watching videos, and enjoying each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that everyone here agrees that each of our unschooling lives looks<br/>\ndifferent.  Even within families, different children are unschooling<br/>\ndifferently.  Perhaps what comes across as only one way to unschool is the<br/>\npoint that the only way to unschool is by letting your children have the<br/>\ncontrol over their education ALL the time.  They&#39;re saying that you can&#39;t<br/>\nunschool *except* for math, or just during vacations; you can&#39;t unschool<br/>\nafter the lessons are done, or on even-numbered days or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here&#39;s what originally came across as radical to me, but later fell into<br/>\nplace.  After you&#39;ve been giving your children control over their education,<br/>\nwhich is really control over how they spend their time, perhaps you&#39;ll start<br/>\nlooking at the other places you exert control in their lives.  I grew from<br/>\nwanting to unschool with a math curriculum (not really possible to do, but I<br/>\nwas trying!) to letting go of the whole curriculum idea, to letting go of<br/>\nrestrictions on tv/video time, restrictions on foods, etc.  But it takes<br/>\nTIME to get there for a lot of us.  (And you may strongly defend some<br/>\ncherished ideas on the way.  I&#39;m still slightly chargrinned over some of my<br/>\nposts 8 or 9 months ago before I let go of more control areas!)<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I use textbooks, workbooks, chalkboards, and the other acoutrements of<br/>\nschool in my unschooling?  Yep.  I myself got a lot out of a very nice math<br/>\neducation textbook last year.  Very interesting.  My son has a couple of<br/>\nworkbooks he used last month a few times, I think.  And boy, we love<br/>\nchalkboards.  Great for coloring on when the sidewalks are all wet.  My<br/>\npoint is that anything is fair game, it&#39;s just about being willing to see it<br/>\nused in any way.  And not requiring anyone to use it in one particular way<br/>\nor at any particular time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that help?  I really think &quot;getting it&quot; has the most to do with &quot;living<br/>\nit&quot; than &quot;thinking it&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53453,"nextTopicId":53328}}
