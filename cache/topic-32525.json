But did she know it?  I don&#39;t think so.  In fact, her older<br/>\n  sister was severely abusive and made my mom look like a saint.  My Mom&#39;s<br/>\n  family was Italian and Irish, and yelling and slapping was the norm.  My<br/>\n  Dad&#39;s family was Mexican and did not yell or slap, but had very violent<br/>\n  tempers.  Both my parents were physically abused by one of their parents.<br/>\n  So, when I got married and got mad and spewed abuse, my husband turned<br/>\n  around and said, &quot;I&#39;m done.&quot; And went to the other room.  I had to think<br/>\n  about my actions, and about how am I respecting others when I am angry. <br/>\n  Then I had kids, and when I was frustrated, the pitch and volume of my<br/>\n  voice would rise.  My husband would tell me, &quot;You&#39;re yelling.&quot;  I didn&#39;t<br/>\n  even realize it.  I used to say, &quot;Well, I&#39;m Italian and Mexican and<br/>\n  Irish.  We have bad tempers.  We yell, but it doesn&#39;t mean anything.&quot;  It<br/>\n  took years for me to accept that my mother was abusive to me.  I had<br/>\n  already known that my father was physically abusive to her, which is why<br/>\n  they&#39;d divorced.  So, I know what you mean about doing things without<br/>\n  realizing it.  Fortunately, I&#39;ve stopped making excuses for my<br/>\n  misbehavior.  When I get upset, and my voice starts to become shrill, my<br/>\n  kids and I have a codeword which means I&#39;m crossing the line into a<br/>\n  tirade and they want me to stop.  It&#39;s &quot;Peace&quot; accompanied by the peace<br/>\n  sign.  We talked a lot before deciding on that word.  All the other words<br/>\n  had negative connotations for me and only fed my anger and frustration. <br/>\n  I have also found that it is worth the time it takes to go for a cooling<br/>\n  off walk before trying to communicate when I&#39;m angry.  As time goes on,<br/>\n  and I learn that it is not about getting control of my kids but about<br/>\n  listening and having a good relationship with them of respect, it is less<br/>\n  and less that I need the &quot;Peace&quot; sign.  (My mom has expressed an interest<br/>\n  in learning new ways of relating with children after hearing about my<br/>\n  discoveries in this area.
