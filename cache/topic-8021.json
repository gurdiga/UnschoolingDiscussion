It<br/>\nis about my son, Colton, who is 9 1/2.  I thought it might speak to the<br/>\nhearts of moms who have kids growing up way too fast.<br/>\n<br/>\n   This is perhaps a tacky story to tell you, but if I can&#39;t vent to my<br/>\nkindred spirits I will surely go mad.  We have noticed some changes in<br/>\nColton<br/>\nlately.  He has been emotional and moody.  He can spit out his words with<br/>\nthe<br/>\nspeed of an auctioneer.  He can captain a debating team.  He can hold my<br/>\nhand<br/>\none minute and be rolling his eyes at me the next.  Bud and I have wondered<br/>\nwhat is going on with him.  We have even gone so far as to ask, &quot;OK, so who<br/>\nare you, REALLY?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n   I finally have it figured out.  I can sum up the changes in one single,<br/>\nhorrifying word...<br/>\n<br/>\n   ...puberty.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how the mystery was solved.  As Colton was about to take a shower<br/>\nlast<br/>\nnight, I heard him yank back the shower curtain.  Then he yelled for my<br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n I ran up to his bathroom to find him naked as the day he was born (only<br/>\nconsiderably taller), clutching the shower curtain rod in his hands.  This<br/>\nwas nothing new to me because I&#39;ve experienced it too; the rod will fall<br/>\nright off the wall if you pull too hard on the curtain.  While I was putting<br/>\nthe curtain rod back up, I smelled an unmistakable odor.  Was it really?<br/>\nCould it be?  YES, it was.<br/>\n<br/>\n   SWEAT!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n   It didn&#39;t take long to pinpoint where the odor was coming from, since I&#39;d<br/>\njust had my shower.  I congratulated Colton on growing up, found him a stick<br/>\ndeodorant in a manly &quot;cool breeze&quot; scent and told him how to use it.  Then I<br/>\nset the deodorant on his bathroom counter, right next to the bottle of hair<br/>\ngel which has recently taken up residence.  Yes, Colton is now *styling* his<br/>\nhair, whereas six months ago he rarely combed it.  He wears it in a style I<br/>\nthink of as &quot;shiny bedhead,&quot; but my son assures me this is &quot;cool.&quot;  I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t know, as I haven&#39;t been cool in 400 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Intellectually, I knew my son was growing up.  But I don&#39;t think with my<br/>\nhead, I think with my heart.  And my heart is several years behind.  So if<br/>\nyou see me this week, give me a comforting hug.  Here is how you will<br/>\nrecognize me: there will be tears in my eyes and I&#39;ll be holding Colton&#39;s<br/>\nold<br/>\nteddy bear.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nEnjoy the award-winning journalism of The New York Times with<br/>\nconvenient home delivery.

That whole business about it being o.k. is simply<br/>\n&gt; manufacturers trying to get more customers.  When I went through the<br/>\n&gt; classes back in the dark ages, we were told they were definately not o.k.<br/>\n&gt; for anyone who wasn&#39;t sexually active and were really not designed for<br/>\n&gt; anyone who hadn&#39;t had a child yet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We now know that they contain Dioxin and this push for younger and younger<br/>\n&gt; girls to use tampons would seem to correlate with the increase in various<br/>\n&gt; cancers and the younger and younger age that women are getting cancer<br/>\n&gt; (ovarian, cervical, uterine and breast).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, this is really weird because this seems to be a topic on several lists<br/>\n&gt; right now so I have my whole Dioxin speel down.  Dioxin is in the top 10 of<br/>\n&gt; known carcenogens.  It is the &quot;evil&quot; from Love Canal, etc.  It is fat<br/>\n&gt; soluable, not water soluable which means it resides in fatty tissues and is<br/>\n&gt; found in humans, mammals, birds and fish and seeks them out, so to speak.<br/>\n&gt; Dioxin is the by-product of the bleaching process that cotton goes through<br/>\n&gt; and is residual.  Rayon is also another problem as are the chemicals that<br/>\n&gt; are put in tampons.  There are unbleached tampons available that are<br/>\n&gt; chemical free.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lynda, who will stop ranting now %-}<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Tamilooch@...\">Tamilooch@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Parental Crisis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, April 11, 2000 12:06 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This board has been quiet for a while. But I hope all you supportive moms<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; somewhere near your computers. I am having a Mother Moment I think and<br/>\n&gt; need<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some real good advice soon.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; okay here is the situation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My dd is 81/2.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Over the weekend while she was at my girlfriends house, I went on a<br/>\n&gt; cleaning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spree. In the process I found a pair of undies that I just bought for her<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; last weekend, rolled in a ball under her bed. There was signs of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;spotting&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on them .<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Okay I know this is normal but 81/2? Isnt that a bit young , I was 11<br/>\n&gt; myself<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my sisters were both 14, my bestfriend was almost 16. Although I believe<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; husbands sisters were younger than that?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway I asked her about it and she seemed to not know what I was talking<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; about. I told her it was okay to tell me , even if it was a little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; embarrassing but she insisted so I didnt push the issue. I called my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bestfriend who has a 12yod that went through this over the summer. Her 10<br/>\n&gt; yod<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just had a class on this in school she had some booklets tha she gave me<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bring home to my dd. which I did and she read them on her own , I left<br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out for her. when I asked her about it , she said &quot;Mom that is sick!&quot;  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried to make light of it and giggled and said I know but do you have any<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; questions? She said no and I thought maybe I should drop the subject for<br/>\n&gt; now<br/>\n&gt; &gt; .What do you guys think? I know shes a bit young to be able to grasp this<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; concept , so I dont want to freak her out, but at the same time I want to<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; make sure she knows what shes doing too. She absolutely hates to go to<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Drs. and I think she is too young for that kind of Dr. Does anyone agree?<br/>\n&gt; The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; booklet also said that its okay to use Tampons for swimming, ??????

Glad I grew up in the 80s<br/>\n&gt; and the info wasnt hard to come by even if I would have rathered  hear it<br/>\n&gt; from mom. Anyway I think your right that she dosnt need a Dr. right now, and<br/>\n&gt; Im so relieved to hear you say that because getting her into the Dr. office<br/>\n&gt; of the ped. she has had since she was 2 is a process. She really hates it.<br/>\n&gt; She wont even pee in the cup, we have to bring it home. I also do not think<br/>\n&gt; it is an injury as she tends to be somewhat of a hypercondriac(sp) (thats<br/>\n&gt; just my way of saying she loves to make sure I tend to all her boo bos.) She<br/>\n&gt; definately would have said something to me. And as for utis and fisures Im<br/>\n&gt; not sure so I think well just keep and eye on it and see if we need to see<br/>\n&gt; the DR.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for keeping me grounded.<br/>\n&gt; I really appreciate it.<br/>\n&gt; Tamie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Avoid the lines and visit avis.com for quick and easy online<br/>\n&gt; reservations.

It <br/>\nis about my son, Colton, who is 9 1/2.  I thought it might speak to the <br/>\nhearts of moms who have kids growing up way too fast.<br/>\n<br/>\n   This is perhaps a tacky story to tell you, but if I can&#39;t vent to my <br/>\nkindred spirits I will surely go mad.  We have noticed some changes in Colton <br/>\nlately.  He has been emotional and moody.  He can spit out his words with the <br/>\nspeed of an auctioneer.  He can captain a debating team.  He can hold my hand <br/>\none minute and be rolling his eyes at me the next.  Bud and I have wondered <br/>\nwhat is going on with him.  We have even gone so far as to ask, &quot;OK, so who <br/>\nare you, REALLY?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n   I finally have it figured out.  I can sum up the changes in one single, <br/>\nhorrifying word...<br/>\n<br/>\n   ...puberty.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how the mystery was solved.  As Colton was about to take a shower last <br/>\nnight, I heard him yank back the shower curtain.  Then he yelled for my help. <br/>\n I ran up to his bathroom to find him naked as the day he was born (only <br/>\nconsiderably taller), clutching the shower curtain rod in his hands.  This <br/>\nwas nothing new to me because I&#39;ve experienced it too; the rod will fall <br/>\nright off the wall if you pull too hard on the curtain.  While I was putting <br/>\nthe curtain rod back up, I smelled an unmistakable odor.  Was it really?  <br/>\nCould it be?  YES, it was.<br/>\n<br/>\n   SWEAT!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n   It didn&#39;t take long to pinpoint where the odor was coming from, since I&#39;d <br/>\njust had my shower.  I congratulated Colton on growing up, found him a stick <br/>\ndeodorant in a manly &quot;cool breeze&quot; scent and told him how to use it.  Then I <br/>\nset the deodorant on his bathroom counter, right next to the bottle of hair <br/>\ngel which has recently taken up residence.  Yes, Colton is now *styling* his <br/>\nhair, whereas six months ago he rarely combed it.  He wears it in a style I <br/>\nthink of as &quot;shiny bedhead,&quot; but my son assures me this is &quot;cool.&quot;  I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t know, as I haven&#39;t been cool in 400 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Intellectually, I knew my son was growing up.  But I don&#39;t think with my <br/>\nhead, I think with my heart.  And my heart is several years behind.  So if <br/>\nyou see me this week, give me a comforting hug.  Here is how you will <br/>\nrecognize me: there will be tears in my eyes and I&#39;ll be holding Colton&#39;s old <br/>\nteddy bear.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tddy_Br@juno.com","from":"Tddy_Br@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"xYHriPUNRAayx9qOmVxujjcgwVIVUsTtE7-_qe3LV27vDlXf5qI_KNQjwYK0UYEjqXdCWC1IBw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Parental Crisis","postDate":"955483993","msgId":8021,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNDExLjE1MTMxMy4tMjY0MDkxLjExLlRkZHlfQnJAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8025,"prevInTime":8020,"nextInTime":8022,"topicId":8021,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi  -- I just HAD to chime on on this one!!

My dd (8 1/2) started last<br/>\nmonth!  I thought it was a bit young, too, but it wasn&#39;t just spotting -<br/>\nshe actually started.  I spoke to her pediatrician and he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nrecommend any type of GYN exam until she is about 16 or so unless there<br/>\nare problems.   He also suggested AGAINST tampons until she has finished<br/>\ngrowing ... something about it possibly affecting growth and maturity of<br/>\nher internal genital organs?? I&#39;m not sure about that but I am definitely<br/>\nagainst tampons in &#39;children.&#39;  Maybe when she is a teen (or better yet,<br/>\nan adult) she can make that decision but for now ... no.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when I was a kid they made &#39;mini&#39; pads that were just the<br/>\nright size for teens.  I couldn&#39;t find them anywhere!  It seems all they<br/>\nhave now are the thin maxis and they are too wide.  I finially found a<br/>\nnon-thin maxi that is pretty narrow (generic brand, it figures) and they<br/>\nseemed to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nOddly, she handled it just fine ... Mommy is the one who freaked out!  I<br/>\ncan&#39;t believe how young kids are &#39;growing up&#39; these days.  I decided it<br/>\nwas a good time to cover that in a health unit (not geared towards her<br/>\nbut just general information and teaching).  She took to this pretty<br/>\nwell.  I found a site owned by Tampax (go  figure) that sent a free<br/>\nteaching packet including a video tape.  I took out the parts that dealt<br/>\nwith tampons and used it as a very informative addition to our health<br/>\nunit.  It had a full color diagram of reproductive organs and was<br/>\npresented in a very &#39;biologic&#39; fashion.  It seemed to make it easier for<br/>\nher to talk about when we were taking about &#39;women in general&#39; instead of<br/>\nher.  It even covered puberty in males, as well, so it didn&#39;t seem like I<br/>\nwas focusing on her.  I can&#39;t find the web site off hand but if<br/>\ninterested I will look for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Putting on a cup of tea just thinking about my &#39;baby&#39; growing up so<br/>\nearly&gt;&gt;  Want to join me?  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I can help, let me know.  We seem to be on the same path at the<br/>\nmoment.

It is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fact that the chemical in the gel used to make disp. diapers so absorbant<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the same chemical that was removed from tampons in 1988 because it was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;linked to TSS.

So, some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; pre-spotting prior to that age doesn&#39;t sound too out there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, as to the tampons.  That whole business about it being o.k. is<br/>\n&gt; simply<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; manufacturers trying to get more customers.  When I went through the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; classes back in the dark ages, we were told they were definately not o.k.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for anyone who wasn&#39;t sexually active and were really not designed for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; anyone who hadn&#39;t had a child yet.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; We now know that they contain Dioxin and this push for younger and<br/>\n&gt; younger<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; girls to use tampons would seem to correlate with the increase in various<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cancers and the younger and younger age that women are getting cancer<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (ovarian, cervical, uterine and breast).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, this is really weird because this seems to be a topic on several<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lists<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; right now so I have my whole Dioxin speel down.  Dioxin is in the top 10<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; known carcenogens.  It is the &quot;evil&quot; from Love Canal, etc.  It is fat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; soluable, not water soluable which means it resides in fatty tissues and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; found in humans, mammals, birds and fish and seeks them out, so to speak.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Dioxin is the by-product of the bleaching process that cotton goes<br/>\n&gt; through<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and is residual.  Rayon is also another problem as are the chemicals that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are put in tampons.  There are unbleached tampons available that are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; chemical free.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Lynda, who will stop ranting now %-}<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Tamilooch@...\">Tamilooch@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Parental Crisis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, April 11, 2000 12:06 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This board has been quiet for a while.
