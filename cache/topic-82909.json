I&#39;ll get him to send you<br/>\nsome sites - and also make him available for PEM if she wants<br/>\nthe socio political economic analysis of what was actually going<br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is something of his that was published today in AMERICAN<br/>\nVEXILLUM.  It isn&#39;t exactly &quot;on-point&quot; but Civil War history is<br/>\nso fraught with myth and political correctness that it is<br/>\nprobably helpful to take a look at the pig in the poke (that&#39;s<br/>\nAppalachian for shopping bag):<br/>\n<br/>\nA petition has been circulated which demands that the flag of<br/>\nthe United States not be displayed at the funeral ceremony for<br/>\nthe heroic crew of the Confederate States Submarine H.L. Hunley.<br/>\nThe objection is raised in the petition that the soldiers and<br/>\nsailors of the Hunley died fighting for the independence of<br/>\ntheir country from the United States , and that, therefore, the<br/>\nflag of the United States represents the &quot;eternal enemy&quot; of<br/>\nthose brave naval pioneers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is true that the United States forces were the enemy against<br/>\nwhom Confederate States servicemen struggled for the<br/>\nindependence of their homeland.  That struggle ended with the<br/>\ndestruction of Confederate independence.  Sad as that result may<br/>\nhave been for Southern soldiers and sailors, especially for<br/>\nthose who sacrificed their lives in the struggle, the survivors<br/>\nsaw that their sacrifice need not be in vain.  The vindication<br/>\nof the Cause, however, would not come by continuing the struggle<br/>\nfor independence, or view the United States as the &quot;eternal<br/>\nenemy&quot;, but rather by struggling for the cause of states&#39; rights<br/>\nand constitutional government within the context of a re-united<br/>\nAmerica.  This continuing struggle was enunciated by President<br/>\nDavis in 1880, when he encouraged us to, &quot;[b]e obedient and good<br/>\ncitizens, and if Secession ever comes again, let it come from<br/>\nthe North.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot long after President Davis gave that advice, Confederate<br/>\nveterans and their sons rallied under the flag of the United<br/>\nStates , and marched off to war against Spain .  They did not<br/>\nsee that flag as the flag of the &quot;eternal enemy&quot;.  Throughout<br/>\nthe 20th century Southerners fought for the United States and<br/>\ntheir flag.  Now, in the 21st century, Southerners contribute<br/>\nmore than their proportional share to the armed forces, still<br/>\nfighting, as did their Confederate ancestors, for constitutional<br/>\nliberty and independence.  These same Southern veterans, those<br/>\nwho fought under the Southern Cross and those who fought under<br/>\nthe Stars and Stripes, find their final resting places marked by<br/>\nmonuments provided by the government of the United States ,<br/>\nhonouring them all as American veterans.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1875 General Nathan Bedford Forrest attended a reunion of the<br/>\nveterans of the 7th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment, among whom was<br/>\nmy great grandfather, Henry Cannon.  At that reunion, General<br/>\nForrest said to the veterans, &quot;Comrades, through the years of<br/>\nbloodshed and weary marches you were tried and true soldiers.<br/>\nSo through the years of peace you have been good citizens, and<br/>\nnow that we are again united under the old flag, I love it as I<br/>\ndid in the days of my youth, and I feel sure that you love it<br/>\nalso.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can we, their descendants, show that flag any less respect<br/>\nthan did the men who &quot;rode with Forrest&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDevereaux D.
