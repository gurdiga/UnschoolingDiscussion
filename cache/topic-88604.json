Oh coarse this just irritated his school as they had no manipulation <br/>\nover him and were forced to be genuine. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my babbling thoughts this evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way I see their are several new to this list.<br/>\nWelcome to the list.

I have been reading the posts here for a <br/>\nweek or so, and at first did not grasp the concept of &quot;unparenting&quot; (heh heh <br/>\nI like that term now).  I DO understand unschooling, but had not considered <br/>\nthe fact that my children could indeed make their own choices with bedtimes, <br/>\nfood, etc., and end up not watching TV all day and eating sugar.  Well, <br/>\nafter a few days of reading, a little bell went off inside my head and I <br/>\nrealized that this IS the continuum concept in a industrialized society.  <br/>\nRight?<br/>\n<br/>\nI &quot;did&quot; the continuum concept with my children as babies, and have seen the <br/>\nwonderful results.  Then, as they started to get older (they are 3 and 4 <br/>\nnow), I did not know how to incorporate the CC into our lives and decided <br/>\nthat it was impossible in our society.  Now after reading these posts, it <br/>\nseems to me that unparenting/unschooling IS it.  I always remember in the CC <br/>\nthe part where the man did not force the boy to follow him into the woods to <br/>\ngo hunting (if I remember correctly), because if the boy did not WANT to <br/>\nfollow the man he would lose all sense of himself (I don&#39;t think I am <br/>\nexplaining myself well, but I hope you know what I am attempting to get at <br/>\nhere).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, in these past few days I have taken off restrictions regarding TV, <br/>\nfood, and bedtimes.  These last few days have been the first time since my <br/>\nchildren were babies that I felt like I was connected to them again and am <br/>\nseeing them in that same CC way I used to when they were babies.  For awhile <br/>\nI really felt like I had lost that connection where I could see them as <br/>\n&quot;people&quot; and not just &quot;kids.&quot;  I also feel such a tremendous amount of <br/>\nrelief that I am not a &quot;bad&quot; parent because I don&#39;t make my kids eat some <br/>\nallotted amount of vegetables or something.  Anyway, I will stop as I feel <br/>\nlike I am rambling, but I was hoping I will get some feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nErika  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nFind high-speed �net deals � comparison-shop your local providers here. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://broadband.msn.com\">https://broadband.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88680,"nextTopicId":88675}}
