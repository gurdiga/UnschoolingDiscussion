We saw armor that had really <br/>\nbeen used in jousting tournaments, and I would barely have fit in it (I&#39;m <br/>\n5&#39;7&quot;). In the Tower of London, they have the armor of many of the kings <br/>\ndating back hundreds of years. Sure, Henry VIII&#39;s is noticeably large, but <br/>\nmany of them are quite small. They also have the biggest and smallest suit <br/>\nof armor there - the big one is pretty darned tall, so obviously they did <br/>\nhave some tall folks back then. The smallest was made for a young prince.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt turns out that people haven&#39;t been getting taller and taller on a steady <br/>\ncontinuum from ancient times.
