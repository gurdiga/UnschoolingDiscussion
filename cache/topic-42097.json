But the Eiffel Tower<br/>\ndidn&#39;t appear overnight, and the most beautiful cathedrals of the world took<br/>\ndecades to complete.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to think of yourself not as &quot;teacher&quot; the way you remember it, but<br/>\nlike the supplier whose purpose is merely making sure the builder - your<br/>\nchild - can get his hands on the necessary materials when he needs them. Be<br/>\nhappy when you make any sale, however modest. The true architect will use<br/>\nthe <br/>\nmaterials in his own way, in his own time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools force a child into using his limited resources today. &quot;Build a bird<br/>\nhouse,&quot; they demand, &quot;so that we may count how many sticks you&#39;ve<br/>\ncollected.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt home there&#39;s no need for immediate &quot;proof&quot;. Be patient. Don&#39;t measure.<br/>\nWho <br/>\ncan say what exquisite masterpiece your child will shape and build from the<br/>\nscraps tomorrow - or ten years from now? The more he collects, the greater<br/>\nthe structure he&#39;s capable of building. And when that structure is life<br/>\nitself, don&#39;t settle for a bird house today.
