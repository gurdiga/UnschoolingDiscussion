I bet a creative unschooled child who wanted a toy cardboard box<br/>\nviolin would make one for herself. It somehow seems manipulative and<br/>\nuntrusting. It&#39;s a moot point now because the original poster has already<br/>\nsaid they have found an inexpensive one - I think. It reminds me of the<br/>\npassage in &quot;How Children Learn&quot; when Holt describes the Montessori math<br/>\nmanipulatives that can only be used the &quot;correct&quot; way or the teacher takes<br/>\nthem away. Naturally Holt disagreed with this approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn (recently 4) has two small electronic keyboards, the second one we<br/>\nbought because she wanted the microphone attachment to sing into. I guess we<br/>\ncould have given her a cardboard tube and the old keyboard, but she would<br/>\nhave continued to ask for the microphone one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the china analogy, Jayn has several tea sets. Some are china. She<br/>\nalso has a number of fragile china dolls. She knows they are breakable and<br/>\nplays with them accordingly. Some have had broken limbs from accidents, and<br/>\nI have repaired them. It doesn&#39;t mean that she should be given only pictures<br/>\nof dolls, or paper tea cups, until I deem she will be careful enough. There<br/>\nis a whole range between &quot;the best china&quot; and something completely fake. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think the kid who was asking for a violin was planning to &quot;throw it<br/>\naround&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I volunteered you! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      I won&#39;t post your answer to the list if you just want me to send it to <br/>\n&gt; her private email addy, or if you would like to help over 1,000 unschoolers <br/>\n&gt; reading along but don&#39;t want me to use your name or email, I could post it <br/>\n&gt; without those. Any perspective or advice you can offer would be so appreciated <br/>\n&gt; --  JJ<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your concerns about the &quot;toy&quot; violin sounding awful are made reality for <br/>\n&gt; many people!   Fact is, any violin you can buy for $100 (or $150, for that <br/>\n&gt; matter) isn&#39;t going to have a very good sound, and yes, that can turn kids off not <br/>\n&gt; only because they know what does and doesn&#39;t sound good, but also because <br/>\n&gt; playing the violin takes some dexterity---good equipment is necessary as it <br/>\n&gt; &quot;responds&quot; to the player&#39;s efforts.  It&#39;s a complex instrument w/many factors <br/>\n&gt; that contribute to  sound production.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My best suppliers for real violins are:  Shar Music Co. (mail/online order) <br/>\n&gt; and The String House-Rochester.  As for TOY violins, I am pretty old <br/>\n&gt; fashioned in my thinking.  Because the &quot;real&quot; instrument is pretty fragile,  the <br/>\n&gt; &quot;toy&quot; is an opportunity to teach a child to be careful as well as enjoy. It is <br/>\n&gt; imperative that the child has learned to be careful before starting with a real <br/>\n&gt; instrument---and &quot;turning it over&quot; to a child is a process.  Would you hand <br/>\n&gt; your 3 yr old your best china?  I start my little beginners (3-5) on a &quot;box&quot; <br/>\n&gt; violin before moving to the real one.  Boxes are available from Shar Music <br/>\n&gt; Co. (online) or can be made by stuffing a flat 1 lb. margarine box w/newspaper <br/>\n&gt; (for weight), then wrapping with wide masking tape to cover the entire box.  <br/>\n&gt; Cut a 1&quot; slit along the center of one of the sides, toward the &quot;top,&quot; and <br/>\n&gt; insert a paint &quot;paddle&quot; (as can be found for free at a paint store).  This is <br/>\n&gt; the &quot;toy&quot; violin I used w/my students before the cardboard box &quot;violins&quot; came <br/>\n&gt; out.  For a toy to throw around...well, I can&#39;t help you there.  There is, <br/>\n&gt; however, a cool wood violin puzzle (very 3D) that&#39;s composed of colorful <br/>\n&gt; interlocking alphabet blocks.  Found it in the Atlanta Symphony gift shop (online <br/>\n&gt; store) and probably elsewhere, $20.     <br/>\n&gt; *************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I first answered thusly:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dunno if this will help, but my little guy wanted to play the violin <br/>\n&gt; at age four. So I bought one and signed him up for Suzuki, in which the mom <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; child supposedly learn together. Well, the first assignment was to build a <br/>\n&gt; toy violin, from a box covered in brown shopping-bag paper and strings drawn <br/>\n&gt; on <br/>\n&gt; with red magic marker. One end had a paint paddle attached to be the &quot;neck.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      No sound to worry about sounding bad at least! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      The idea was that little children really need to be able to make <br/>\n&gt; mistakes, to be rough, to fumble and drop it, whatever. The first task is to <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ingrain the standing still, the standing straight, the tucking under the <br/>\n&gt; chin at the <br/>\n&gt; right spot, the lifting and lowering and repositioning, et cetera, ad <br/>\n&gt; nauseum. Not making actual sound.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      I don&#39;t mean to misrepresent the method or diss violin playing -- it <br/>\n&gt; did not work for us, obviously, probably for were many reasons other than <br/>\n&gt; this <br/>\n&gt; and that wouldn&#39;t apply to your situation anyway. My only real point is that <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; when this method DOES work, it all starts by building and handling your own <br/>\n&gt; toy <br/>\n&gt; violin and then not playing at all. If you can get anything helpful out of <br/>\n&gt; this, more power to you! &lt;gg&gt;  JJ<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Poor JJ and son---I can see how the magic wore off!  I have always felt that <br/>\n&gt; minimizing the &quot;soundless&quot; stage of learning the violin was important.  My <br/>\n&gt; approach is somewhat different:  Teach the child to &quot;baby&quot; the toy violin, <br/>\n&gt; treat it carefully (yes, there will be spills, but this is to learn on);  Teach <br/>\n&gt; the child how to hold the toy violin, dowel-stick bow, and move the bow in <br/>\n&gt; small strokes that are perpendicular to the strings (cool scientific principal <br/>\n&gt; here, as any bow that is not truly perpendicular will create squeaks).  When <br/>\n&gt; the above steps have been learned well, THEN get the real instrument.  If <br/>\n&gt; done well, the first time the child holds the real violin, he/she will make good <br/>\n&gt; (not squeaky) violin-sounds.  Now many of you can see why Holt &quot;dissed&quot; the <br/>\n&gt; Suzuki Method---too structured (sequenced)---too much adult control.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Honestly, I do not know if it is possible to truly &quot;unschool&quot; learning to <br/>\n&gt; play the violin, tho I&#39;d like to try.  There is no doubt it can (and should) be <br/>\n&gt; taught in a positive, fun manner and include plenty of games (that <br/>\n&gt; ultimately teach good technique), but to NOT get structured instruction and expect <br/>\n&gt; real progress, well success is questionable under those circumstances.  The <br/>\n&gt; instrument is just very complicated and would be tricky to figure out.  The <br/>\n&gt; instrument &quot;hold&quot; and bow &quot;hold&quot; require very specific instruction, or it is <br/>\n&gt; impossible to do that &quot;perpendicular move,&quot; thus, impossible to create a <br/>\n&gt; sterotypical violin-sound.  As a teacher, I&#39;d be willing to experiment (provide <br/>\n&gt; &quot;guidance&quot; and suggestions to a parent and leave things very open)!  My home school <br/>\n&gt; students have always been my best students (and are the reason MY kids learn <br/>\n&gt; at home).  If any body could &quot;unschool&quot; violin, it would be a home learner!  <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ******************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85692,"nextTopicId":85678}}
