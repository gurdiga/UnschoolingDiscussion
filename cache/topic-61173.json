Even if I couldn&#39;t hear it, I thought I could, because I&#39;d<br/>\nheard it so much before, and I knew he was just trying to make me crazy. <br/>\n It drove me wild.   I had once told my mom what he was doing, and she<br/>\nsaid &quot;don&#39;t let him bother you&quot; as if I had those skill to ignore him or<br/>\nturn off my sensitivity to his little noise.

Sure could use some words of wisdom. For the last couple of months, I&#39;ve noticed a change in Sierra. She&#39;s not as easy going as she use to be. Meaning that she is being more troublesome than she ever was. She&#39;s fighting more with Joseph and Alyssa. She&#39;s whining and complaining more and just harder to deal with. There has been nothing of a change that I know of at all with our house or her friends or how we do things. I thought maybe it was a stage so I&#39;ve been working extra hard to do the proper thing when she gets upset. You know about the crying and that has been more so also, although she&#39;s always been like that. She&#39;s almost defiant about things and blames everyone else when something happens. <br/>\n<br/>\nRecent example today that finally made me write and ask for HELP!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was cutting Sierra&#39;s nails in the playroom. I was sitting on the step stool and she was on my lap. I did one hand and the phone rang. When I came back to the playroom, she was almost on the verge of tears and Joseph was asking her what he did wrong. Come to find out that Joseph and her were talking and he did something that upset her. She said to him that he hurt her feelings and to stop. So far so good. Joseph really didn&#39;t have a clue as to what he said to upset her. Now Sierra and I had a very long talk just this morning about when Joseph is bugging her, she can&#39;t just say you&#39;re bugging me and stop. She has to let him know exactly what he&#39;s doing. Bugging me is not clear enough for Joseph. And in fact during this last episode, Joseph was even saying to her that same thing. He just didn&#39;t understand what he said. So I explained again that if she told him, he would know not to say things like that to her. She refused to say what he said. Joseph even asked her to come into the hallway thinking maybe she just didn&#39;t want to in front of me. She refused that also. So I explained that it was up to her to decide. How could Joseph stop upsetting her when he didn&#39;t know what it was he did? She wouldn&#39;t say a word. So I let it go and asked her to come over on my lap so I could finish her nails. The 3 kids were wanting to go outside and Joseph was waiting for her. She told me I cut her nails already. I told her I only did one hand. She refused again to come to me and let me finish. Now I&#39;m only about 4 feet away from her and the space didn&#39;t allow me to go to her and do the job. I asked her 3 times and she looked me right in the face and said not a word but didn&#39;t move. Today was the first day I was feeling like I wasn&#39;t dying and I just got very upset. I know I didn&#39;t help things but I lost it. I reached over and took her by the arm and brought her to my lap and cut her nails while she screamed in my ear. I told her it would probably be best if she went to her room. When I suggest they go to their room, it&#39;s to cool down and they never have to stay there or even go. But she went and screamed and cried in there. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a while, I went in and tried to talk to her and she said she didn&#39;t want to talk to me about it. I left and she fell asleep. When Joe tried to go in to her, she started to cry again and didn&#39;t want to talk. Later she came out like nothing was wrong and we haven&#39;t said another word about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow it wasn&#39;t that she was tired or I&#39;ve been really sick. This is the kind of thing I&#39;ve been trying to work out for a while. I know I should have left the nail thing go. But it wouldn&#39;t have helped the situation with Joseph and her. And to be honest, I&#39;ve heard the two of them before and she makes things up about Joseph. Saying he said something he didn&#39;t.  How can I talk to her about how to handle things when she won&#39;t talk to me? All I get is I don&#39;t know and he&#39;s bugging me. Joseph is not a bugging kind of kid although they both have their moments.
