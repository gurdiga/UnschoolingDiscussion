We have the &quot;neighborhood <br/>\npool&quot;---so we are the summer hang-out (besides, we&#39;re the &quot;cool&quot; parents). After one <br/>\nHORRIBLE summer---five boys & two girls here from 9:00 am to dark two <br/>\nsnacks/day---and often lunch and supper---and VERY often overnight as well---we sent a <br/>\nnice letter to all the parents. We explained how much we had spent the last <br/>\nsummer on snacks and drinks. We were one girl short (moved), so there were 6 <br/>\nguests. They each were in charge of the snack and meals that day. They could have <br/>\nthe children show up there at their homes for scheduled lunches and suppers or <br/>\nthey could send it here in the mornings with the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorked out great.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72984,"nextTopicId":72997}}
