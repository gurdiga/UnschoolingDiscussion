It&#39;s a matter<br/>\nof what *the kids* are ready for. (Though an environment where reading is<br/>\nfun and useful and accessible to the child does need to be there.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child has an environment that encourages it, some will walk at 9 mos.<br/>\nBut no amount of encouragement will make a child who won&#39;t walk until 18 mos<br/>\nwalk earlier. (And if it did push it ahead, what would be the benefit to the<br/>\nchild? At 18 years will a late walker still be 9 months behind?)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the same with reading. I&#39;ve been reading to my daughter since she would<br/>\nsit still for it. She recognized a good portion of the alphabet at 18 mos.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve played word games and talked about words. I&#39;ve answered her questions.<br/>\nShe&#39;s been writing since she was 5 or so -- *well* before she could read a<br/>\npage in an easy reader. But it&#39;s only now at 11 that she will occasionaly<br/>\nread for pleasure. (She will *listen* for pleasure for hours! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn *school* late reading is cause for worry for many reasons: 1) The<br/>\ndemoralization process starts as soon as some significant (to the child)<br/>\nportion of the other kids can read and the child can&#39;t. 2) The schools can&#39;t<br/>\nadequately continue to provide a reading environment (as poor as it is) for<br/>\nolder children. They have a curriculum they need to adhere to and big chunks<br/>\nof reading time just don&#39;t fit in anymore. 3) Getting the information in the<br/>\ncurriculum into the child depends on the child being an independent reader<br/>\nby 4th grade. Schools can&#39;t adequately accomodate a nonreader at that point<br/>\nwithout special services. At that point the child has both a poor<br/>\nenvironment for reading and a poor environment for learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt *home* a later reader is just a child learning through other methods.<br/>\nAnd, though school emphasizes reading as the far and away most important<br/>\ngateway to learning, other ways are just as good. (And actually *better* for<br/>\nkids who are more visual or auditory or kinesthetic or whatever learners.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And you know what I have helped others too learn to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>School is a *very* hard place to learn to read. Why *would* a child want to<br/>\nlearn to read books they don&#39;t want to read when they don&#39;t feel like<br/>\nreading?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the ones you&#39;ve helped are the ones who were ready to read but were<br/>\nhandicapped by their environment. They wouldn&#39;t have been asking questions<br/>\nand been eager to learn if they didn&#39;t feel like they were right on the<br/>\nbrink and just needed a couple of missing keys! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou haven&#39;t been seeing the kids who aren&#39;t ready to read. If they&#39;re older<br/>\nthan average for readers, they&#39;re probably already pretty good at hiding the<br/>\nfact that they can&#39;t read. They certainly won&#39;t call attention to themselves<br/>\nto ask for help on something they&#39;re sure they can&#39;t do or have been<br/>\nconvinced they can&#39;t do or decided is really dumb so why should they bother.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So you tell me once again what I did that was so wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like you did nothing wrong with your kids. :-) If there&#39;s a<br/>\n&quot;wrong&quot; it&#39;s in leading others to believe that what you did with your kids<br/>\nis all that&#39;s necessary for any child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Reading is a key that every child should get<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They will.
