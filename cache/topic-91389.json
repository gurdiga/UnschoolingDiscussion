It stays soft and moldable with a huge <br/>\nvariety of wonderful colors, then you put it in a glass oven proof dish and back <br/>\nfor 15 min for each 1/4 inch thickness.  I ball park it.  At 275 degrees.  It <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to be exact in the timing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also something put out by crayola usually with all the other crayola <br/>\nstuff.  It is like a really light clay, light as in light weight.  You mold <br/>\nit and it air dries into something in the range of Styrofoam for weight, they <br/>\nhave some colors but you can paint it when you are done and just use the white.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I saw yesterday they had a clay that is more like potters clay, they had <br/>\nwhite, and several different brown colors.  That also has to air dry.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThose are the ones that don&#39;t need any special equipment or a kiln.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe love clay and have lots of fun and have used both the sculpey stuff that <br/>\nyou bake in the oven and the crayola stuff.  The boys like the sculpey stuff <br/>\nmore. I think it is because they have so many different colors.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175898140,"authorName":"Marti","from":"Marti &lt;marti@...&gt;","profile":"nestmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Craft","postDate":"1077717186","msgId":91400,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMC4zLjAuMC4yMDA0MDIyNTA4NDkyMy4wMWMwMTdlOEAxMjcuMC4wLjE+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTMwMWMzZmIwNSQ0NDY4YzEzMCQ4M2ViZTJkMUB1c2VydWN3N3dzdTJzYz4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMTMwMWMzZmIwNSQ0NDY4YzEzMCQ4M2ViZTJkMUB1c2VydWN3N3dzdTJzYz4="},"prevInTopic":91399,"nextInTopic":91415,"prevInTime":91399,"nextInTime":91401,"topicId":91389,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
