","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-154534462\">Being a sort of newbie I just had to share this tidbit for other<br/>\nnewbies out there.<br/>\nDS 14 and 10 decided to make level 60 characters in D & D just for fun.<br/>\n(This gives them practically god-like ablilies. Quite cool!) They<br/>\nspent hours on this.  Then they decided to have a battle. What<br/>\nfollowed was dice rolling then some mulitplication and then addition<br/>\nof at least 20 2-digit numbers with subtraction at the 3 to 4 digit<br/>\nlevel.  They did this mostly in their heads with the occasional<br/>\nscribble (they could have grabbed a calculator at any time.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that we don&#39;t always recognize math in our unschooling lives<br/>\nand this may not make it any easier but..they were having such fun I<br/>\nhad to share.  I could not keep up with the mental additon etc they we<br/>\ndoing.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you imagine making kids sit at a desk and do this?!  Shudder!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nNote to Sandra&#39;s kids and any other D & D players who may understand<br/>\nthe situation...whoever went first techically killed the first<br/>\n(something about criticals?) but they continued to add up damage<br/>\nanyway and then they would start over with the others turn.  Too funny!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah and prior, they were working on buying items and trying to <br/>\nspend 1 million gold pieces!  They had not done it yet.  I wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthere to help :) <br/>\n<br/>\nBeth in MD</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62200,"nextTopicId":62822}}
