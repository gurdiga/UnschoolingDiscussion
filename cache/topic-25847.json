On a trip to the zoo with his gma and gpa, they <br/>\nwere quizzing him. Which animal has the long neck, or trunk, etc. I&#39;m sitting <br/>\nuncomfortably, not knowing quite how to intervene, but my son did great. They <br/>\nasked him a couple of questions about animals, then he quizzed them! Asked <br/>\nthem which animal had the hump, then when they answered he said, &#39;Good!&#39; It <br/>\nwas a laugh for everyone and an eye opener too!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25822,"nextTopicId":25829}}
