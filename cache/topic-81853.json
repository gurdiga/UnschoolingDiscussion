THANK GOD you told me this!  Kidding aside, I want to finish my <br/>\ndegree in Special Ed (yea, I know, Homeschool the kid, and then go and teach in <br/>\nbrick & mortar), but my daughter is only one year away from finishing <br/>\nhomeschooling, and my first love is education, not only could I do the job I like, but <br/>\nI could help other homeschoolers.  I started college when Kaycee was 2, she&#39;s <br/>\nnow 17, and I&#39;ve never finished.  WHY?  MATH!  I&#39;m just not a genius here <br/>\nwhen it comes to Algebra.  So, I do great in the other classes, but when it comes <br/>\nto Algebra, I just can&#39;t get it through this thick skull.  And, never being <br/>\ngreat at math, I didn&#39;t take Algebra in HS; I got away w/basic & business math!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter many failures, I&#39;ve finally discovered that I DON&#39;T NEED TO TAKE THE <br/>\nHARDEST MATH classes in the world!  LOL, I&#39;m just going to do the math at a <br/>\ncommunity college; not the 4 year where the same damned class is harder!  Took me <br/>\n3 tries to figure this one out.  My problem was that I *thought* I *had* to <br/>\ntake the hard classes to get a *good job*!  NOT!  NOBODY CARES as long as you <br/>\ntake the class and pass it!  My other problem WAS that I&#39;d be getting all &quot;A&quot;&#39;s <br/>\nin EVERY OTHER class I&#39;d be taking until I took that first Math exam and get a <br/>\nhorrid grade on it.  I&#39;d get so discouraged that it would affect my other <br/>\nclasses!  Well, I&#39;ve got a fix for that one too!  I&#39;m ONLY going to take the MATH <br/>\nclasses; NO OTHER CLASS w/IT!  It may take longer that way, but, it CAN&#39;T <br/>\naffect those other classes that I do so well at!<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren","from":"Ren &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"typical unschooling","postDate":"1065021565","msgId":81853,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMxMDAxLjExMjAxOS4yMjA2Ny4yMzI4OUB3ZWJtYWlsMDQubnljLnVudGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":81857,"prevInTime":81852,"nextInTime":81854,"topicId":81853,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"/out math, I am condemning my child to poor wages.
