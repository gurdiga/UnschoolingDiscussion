Sounds like it is <br/>\nfrustrating HER.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Lauren is left handed.  She has been since birth, although it appeared <br/>\nthat she was ambidexterous.  She still uses both hands while writing.  When <br/>\none hand gets tired, she switches.  I&#39;ve heard this is more common in left <br/>\nhanded people than in right.  When my grandmother used to *encourage* her to <br/>\nuse her right hand, she would become frustrated and irritable.  My guess is <br/>\nthat Kai&#39;s teacher is probably pushing the *wrong* hand and causing him <br/>\nfrustration, rather than he being frustrated by not having a *chosen* <br/>\nhandedness.  Left to his own accord, he will choose the hand that works best <br/>\nfor him at the right time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if this helps any, but if he were my child, I&#39;d make it clear <br/>\nthat whatever hand he chooses is HIS choice.  It is very damaging to <br/>\nchildren who are left handed to be forced into being *right*.  If he was a <br/>\nsolid right handed kid, I&#39;m sure she would have other judgements as to the <br/>\nreasons behind his frustrations.  Unless he expresses frustration in his <br/>\nhandedness, how is she to know?  This used to be a wide spread problem &#39;back <br/>\nin the day&#39;.

So he was able to decide for<br/>\nhimself which way worked best. And sometimes, in sporting things, right<br/>\nworked and sometimes it was left. Everyone except for one nephew is right<br/>\nhanded in both our families. If I just assumed Joseph would be a righty too,<br/>\nthat wouldn&#39;t have been any better than if I never let him try right handed<br/>\nthings because he was obviously a lefty.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143939629,"authorName":"Kris","from":"&quot;Kris&quot; &lt;louisa@...&gt;","profile":"louisam1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"A question about &quot;handedness&quot;","postDate":"1054185981","msgId":71223,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyMDMwMWMzMjVhMiRkODA4ZjA2MCQ5YWJjYTNjZUBrcmlzPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":71227,"prevInTime":71222,"nextInTime":71224,"topicId":71223,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m posting this hoping that one of you has some information I can share with a friend on the issue of handedness in children.

The head instructor was telling Lindsay that Kai didn&#39;t seem to have a hand preference, he even changes from one hand to another for most tasks.  She says it may be causing him frustration and suggested that they begin encouraging him to use one hand or the other for each task.<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan hasn&#39;t shown a hand preference yet either and seems adept at using both.  I&#39;ve never given it a thought and figured he would be double blessed to have full use of both.  My first instinct is that this woman is full of &quot;hooey&quot; and that saying things like, &quot;Maybe you can draw/paint/build with just one hand this time.&quot; is stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m very interested to know what you wise ones might know on this subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70302,"nextTopicId":71516}}
