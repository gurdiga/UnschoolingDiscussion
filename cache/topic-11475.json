My youngest <br/>\nis 5 so he isn&#39;t offically schooling yet.  This was my first year and I loved <br/>\nit.  I was wondering if anyone on this list lives near Youngstown, Ohio area? <br/>\n I get my assessment tommorow and I am nervous about it because my children <br/>\ndid more computer work and hands on things.  I  now have a camera and video <br/>\ncamera to use so I guess this will help for next year.  How does everyone <br/>\nkeep track for all the projects and such?  Thanks so much for the answers to <br/>\nthese questions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11474,"nextTopicId":11479}}
