So far, in my (I hope) gentle probing, I&#39;ve gotten &quot;yeah, sort of&quot; <br/>\nanswers to questions about needing a larger group of friends and some <br/>\nindependence, wanting to be like everyone else and wanting to be around <br/>\nkids more.  I got a &quot;not really that&quot; to questions about whether he <br/>\nwondered if he could handle the work.<br/>\n<br/>\n   And I got a solid yes - I&#39;m both devestated by this and glad of it <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s one I can do something about- when I asked if he was feeling <br/>\nalone and not accepted in our family.  Wow.   But this kid springs back.  A <br/>\ncouple of days of me really working on my relationship with him, getting to <br/>\nknow him again it feels like and we both feel way more connected.  And <br/>\nthat&#39;s great (although the six year old suffers!  I can never find the <br/>\nright balance.)  But he still says he wants to go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have many more things to talk about.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Let him know clearly why YOU chose not to send him to school<br/>\nand what your concerns are about him going. Be honest. BUT - you can do<br/>\nthat while still honoring HIS opinions - you don&#39;t have to (I know you<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t) make him feel like an idiot for wanting to try it out.

I think my struggle as an <br/>\nunschooling mom is ALWAYS about staying positive.  And I think that&#39;s a <br/>\ngood insight on how the falling out with friends played into this.  I also <br/>\nlike your approach about making the school people a little afraid.  Should <br/>\nbe easy enough as I was once a sixth grade teacher.  Except it won&#39;t <br/>\nbe!

Let him know clearly why YOU chose not to send him to school <br/>\nand what your concerns are about him going. Be honest. BUT - you can do <br/>\nthat while still honoring HIS opinions - you don&#39;t have to (I know you <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t) make him feel like an idiot for wanting to try it out. It is <br/>\nSO understandable that a kid who has never gone to school might think <br/>\nthat is THE answer if he&#39;s feeling out of sorts - socially, especially. <br/>\nYou can offer your information and ideas and listen carefully to his <br/>\nAND you can even say, &quot;Well, it is part of my own philosophy to support <br/>\nyou when you have strong interests like this so that IS what I&#39;m going <br/>\nto do.&quot; You don&#39;t want to lie to him by pretending that you think it is <br/>\na great idea - but you DO want to be honest with him that you&#39;re going <br/>\nto help and support him in his choice even though it wouldn&#39;t be your <br/>\nchoice. AND - you can be honest with him that you&#39;re really pleased <br/>\nthat he&#39;s thinking for himself and trying to find FOR HIMSELF what <br/>\nworks.

I <br/>\nthink you said it has been around a year - maybe he&#39;s just coming to <br/>\nterms with the fact that this is permanent - a bit like coming to terms <br/>\nwith death. So he&#39;s sort of deep inside decided it is time to do <br/>\nsomething about developing a new social life, and school looks, from <br/>\nthe outside, like the prime place to do that.  Makes sense and is a <br/>\ngood and healthy and smart move on his part, if that is what is <br/>\nmotivating it. HE doesn&#39;t know what the social life of middle school is <br/>\nreally like - the miserable parts of it are made fun of on Malcolm in <br/>\nthe Middle, as if it is all a joke. So - if you respect that he <br/>\nabsolutely does have valid reasons for  wanting to go, and accept them <br/>\nJUST like you&#39;ve accepted his interests in everything else for the past <br/>\n10 years, treat it the same way as if he&#39;d said he wants to go to any <br/>\nother activity - help him weigh the pros and cons, respect HIS <br/>\nopinions, support his decisions, make sure he FEELS that his option to <br/>\nchange his mind is wide open, I think you&#39;re going to do fine with <br/>\nthis, Pam.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to stop feeling it as a personal failure and see it as just <br/>\nanother interest of his - since it is problematic in so many ways, <br/>\nyou&#39;d want to explore what he wants out of it, what the problems are <br/>\nthat you (and he) see with it, etc. JUST as if he decided to take up <br/>\nscuba diving or sky diving or something else that seems dangerous and <br/>\nscary to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mar 19, 2005, at 2:02 AM, Pam Tellew wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; OK, Sandra, re-reading your school choice article was helpful.

And it is kind of like that at our house, <br/>\non my best nights. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Simpsons is a funny show that shows some of the ugly side of school in a very knowing way.  If you watch, there will be lots of classroom, playground and school bus scenes that you can discuss.<br/>\n<br/>\n**And I think he&#39;s wanting to feel just like everyone else.  What do I do with that?**<br/>\n<br/>\n(My first thought was read lots of Spiderman comics that show the loner as hero, but those might be too sad.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s shake and rattle some of our assumptions about individuality as a good thing.  I do think individuality is important, but, on the other hand, learning how to blend in and function in groups can be a very useful skill.  (Nobody yell at me until reaching the end of this paragraph. &lt;g&gt;)  I *don&#39;t* think a classroom is a good way to learn this stuff, especially not a middle school classroom.  But doing some roleplaying at home about group dynamics, and reading Miss Manners at the breakfast table, and looking for some pleasant group activities and integrating more social coaching might help.  It is useful to be able to assess new group situations and understand their dynamics and join in that new community without making a lot of waves.  (I realize this may be tangential to what you asked.)<br/>\n<br/>\nStretching even more, it&#39;s possible that doing some kind of volunteer work in the community is a way to meet the need to feel good about oneself and to feel happy about being connected to other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I wish there were more activities that welcomed kids and adults simultaneously.  But maybe I&#39;m just not using enough imagination right now.  There are certainly some activities that don&#39;t exclude kids.  Bird-watching?  Pickle-making?  umm...)<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to be kind of chaotic person, but maybe Sam likes structure and predictability in his Saturday class.

I can hardly stop crying and I keep trying to hide it from the <br/>\nkids but they know.  My son so clearly knows this isn&#39;t what I want that he <br/>\nreally seemed afraid to say it was what he wanted - that&#39;s not what I want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess there are two issues:  all the intense feeling I&#39;m having and how <br/>\nto deal with them when I really have very little time away from my kids... <br/>\nand how to handle things with Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the more straightforward part is how to handle it with Sam.  So far <br/>\nwe&#39;ve asked why and he says he wants to be around kids his age more.  He <br/>\nunderstands the limitations of school interactions but he seems to like <br/>\nbeing in a big group and kind of observing what all the other kids are <br/>\ndoing.  Big unstructured groups like park day have always been hard for him <br/>\nbut he lives for this weekly nature program he goes to because he gets to <br/>\nhang around with kids and be part of a group but if he&#39;s not really being <br/>\naccepted into a small group he can still be there for a reason - <br/>\nhiking.  He loves this group even though he had problems with teasing (the <br/>\nadults there handled it well).  I think he thinks school will be like that <br/>\ntoo.  Or like Malcolm in the Middle - just the social parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t want to go for a day and just check it out and I learned that <br/>\nthe school district doesn&#39;t allow child visitors, only parents.  I figure I <br/>\ncan visit and talk to teachers about bringing him by after school to look <br/>\nat the books and all that.  (I say I can; really I&#39;m not sure I won&#39;t start <br/>\ncrying!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe knows that the things he knows and has mastered hardly intersect at all <br/>\nwith the reading and writing of school.  He asked me to teach him spelling <br/>\na couple of weeks ago (it turns out it was because he wanted to &quot;get up to <br/>\nspeed&quot; to go to school).  He says he wants to see what&#39;s expected and work <br/>\non areas he&#39;s &quot;behind&quot; on before fall.  It feels like a lot to me and I&#39;m <br/>\ntrying to stay positive.  I know it needs to be his thing, not mine, but I <br/>\nreally do cringe inside thinking of having to face teachers who will think <br/>\nI&#39;m educationally negligent.  (Not feeling very strong right now.)  I&#39;m <br/>\nwondering how much I should say to him.  I mean, I think he&#39;ll probably get <br/>\nteased for writing slowly in big crooked capital letters, but maybe he <br/>\nwon&#39;t.  Do I keep quiet or try to prepare him emotionally and if so, how?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as his lack of kids:  what happened is that we had a falling out <br/>\nwith some close friends a year ago, also had some uncertainty about moving <br/>\nand have had the least social year since he was born.  I feel socially <br/>\ndeprived too!  Last week, after we finally decided not to move, I started <br/>\narranging a whole bunch of homeschool social things for us.  Felt like <br/>\nspring was coming to me, but maybe it was too late for him.   He says he <br/>\nwas happy with our group before we had this falling out and homeschooling <br/>\nwas working for him.  He doesn&#39;t seem optimistic about new groups meeting <br/>\nhis needs.  He has a point that there aren&#39;t lots of kids his age and <br/>\nhomeschoolers around here often go to high school - few teens.  I was <br/>\nhoping to use my pretty good organizing skills to try to create a pool of <br/>\nhomeschooled teens for my kids.  But I thought I had more time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe might change his mind before fall but he usually doesn&#39;t.  He did say he <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want to do it if he didn&#39;t have the option to quit (which of <br/>\ncourse he would).  And I know it might not last.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what do I do now?  Do I not try to talk him out of it?  (I&#39;m so bad at <br/>\nkeeping my opinions to myself - maybe that&#39;s why he wants to go.)   What do <br/>\nI do with all my sad (not necessarily rational) feelings - that I&#39;m losing <br/>\nhim, that he&#39;s somehow rejecting our values, that he thinks unschooling <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work...I don&#39;t know.
