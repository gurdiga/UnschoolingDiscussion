I&#39;m almost positive that Vargas Llosa coined it. <br/>\nThe book though is about Garcia Marquez&#39;s rise as one of the leaders <br/>\nof the Latin American Literary Boom. The book is about his books and <br/>\nthe process of his writing;  how his work is about creating a <br/>\nuniverse and in essence, about how novelists just want to be little <br/>\ngods. What I remember most about the book was how he described his <br/>\nrituals for writing  --in that, he has a kindred heart in Stephen <br/>\nKing. They both write, no matter what, for 7 hours every day! On the <br/>\nother hand, Julio Cortazar would write in spurts (The movie Blow Up <br/>\nis based on a screenplay he wrote based on one of his short stories. <br/>\nAlso, does anybody remember the video for REMs &quot;Everybody Hurts&#39;?

It is almost <br/>\nwritten by two different King&#39;s  --each one a before and after his <br/>\naccident (the one that nearly killed him in Maine).

The post was about how <br/>\nPhonics, by taking away context, is robbing a lot of people of a <br/>\nbetter understanding of the English language.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a moment, especially for people who want to go on to writing <br/>\nand doing more abstract work, that they will need to have more than a <br/>\nconcrete understanding of words. I just want to bring hope to parents <br/>\nthat are freaking out because of their kids hardship. There is a way <br/>\nof overcoming those writing road blocks and it is a way that can be <br/>\nfun. I am allergic to pain, so take it from me that it can be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, you bring an interesting issue. My exercise was not about <br/>\nlearning languages; it was about better understand English through <br/>\nthe word JOURNAL. One of the side effects is that, by doing so, one <br/>\ncan come across information that can broaden our knowledge of other <br/>\nlanguages.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning how to speak a new language, whether French, German or <br/>\nFarsi, is another story. The learning skills involved go way beyond <br/>\nthe scope or Phonetics or Etymology. The way you describe how you <br/>\nlearned to speak Farsi is very productive for learning any language. <br/>\nIt is the way we as babies learn how to speak. Babies do not learn <br/>\nthrough phonics or phonetics. Babies learn by pointing to a tree and <br/>\nsaying &quot;TEE&quot;. And the more they say it, the more proficient they get. <br/>\nEven babies who seemed to not talk for a while and then just start <br/>\ngabbing away do so in their play.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, Phonics may work for a while but I have found, by teaching other <br/>\nlanguages, that people develop a better understand of the mechanics <br/>\nby looking under the hood. My post had to do with that aspect of <br/>\nlearning how to write. Phonics seems to be a way of learning <br/>\nautomatically how to read or write a word without knowing the &#39;how&#39; <br/>\nand &#39;why&#39; about it. This may make a child proficient for an <br/>\nassessment exam but will not necessarily give her the tools necessary <br/>\nfor better expressing herself through her writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my case, because I am dyslexic and because my native language is <br/>\nSpanish, writing in English was a horrendously painful process that I <br/>\ndid not master until I turned 21. Some of it was fear and some of it <br/>\nwas really the chore of having to spend long hours re-writing my <br/>\nwork. Something clicked and what did it for me was: (1) playing more <br/>\nwith my dictionaries, (2) writing more, (3) reading more, (3) MSWord <br/>\nspell check. I swear, it is that simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can pick and choose which ever way you want to attack writing <br/>\nbut, any published writer will tell you the same. For that I highly <br/>\nrecommend Stephen King&#39;s book On Writing. It is truly a jewel (and <br/>\nthis coming from a woman that is too chicken to read his Scaryness). <br/>\nThe book that changed my life, though, was a book about Gabriel <br/>\nGarcía Márquez called History of a Deicide (Historia de un Deicidio); <br/>\nwritten by another demi-god of Latin American literature, Mario <br/>\nVargas Llosa. Unfortunately, I believe the book is out of print. <br/>\nKing&#39;s book, though, I highly recommend.

I like it when <br/>\nother people tell me interesting things about word origins, but I don&#39;t find <br/>\nmyself out looking for such information on my own. When I wanted to learn to <br/>\nspeak Farsi (my husband&#39;s language) - I didn&#39;t care one whit about word <br/>\norigins - I just wanted to learn the words for things and how the language <br/>\nwas structured. What worked super well for me was very concrete learning - <br/>\nI&#39;d touch a tree and someone would say, &quot;This is a tree. It has leaves.&quot; Then <br/>\nthey&#39;d pull a leaf off and say, &quot;This is a leaf.&quot; And so on. Then I&#39;d do <br/>\neverything I could to find opportunities to use the words I&#39;d learned - I&#39;d <br/>\ntalk about trees and leaves and so on right away and for the next week, as <br/>\noften as possible. PLUS - I talked in Farsi as much as I could. If I didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow a word I&#39;d try to describe it, still in Farsi (didn&#39;t know how to say <br/>\n&quot;mirror&quot; but I said, awkwardly, &quot;glass that I can see my face in.&quot;) and, if I <br/>\ncould not do that or if I needed to move on in what I was saying, I&#39;d just <br/>\nstick in English words. And, on the side, I&#39;d read a bit about the syntax of <br/>\nthe language, and other stuff like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo - on the one hand I think it is a COOL way to learn a language if it does <br/>\ndraw on your own natural curiosity and, on the other hand, I just wanted to <br/>\nremind people that what is very cool for one person could be very wrong for <br/>\nanother. I can just imagine someone trying to get their kid interested in <br/>\nword origins, when the kid just wants to speak Spanish so they can understand <br/>\nsome other kids who speak Spanish among themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is SO tempting to think that we&#39;ve got it all figured out &lt;G&gt; -- that <br/>\nwe&#39;ve figured out the best way for people to learn something.

Now, I am a Caribbean mutt, so this is but just one aspect <br/>\nof my heritage. What is interesting is that, even though up to this <br/>\ndate the Catalonian Sabater [sa-ba-TER] identify themselves as <br/>\nCatholic, there are some Jewish genealogists who claim that it is a <br/>\nconverto last name. The last name is from Barcelona and although, on <br/>\none level it means the first Sabater was part of a guild; on another <br/>\nlevel, it means it could be a Jewish last name.<br/>\n<br/>\nCatalonia became a safe-heaven to Jews fleeing Castille & Leon and <br/>\nmost of the working and middle class in that region were Jews. So <br/>\nthere is a great historical probability that Sabater is indeed a <br/>\nJewish last name (as well a code word for the Sabbath). Given that my <br/>\ngreat-grandfather was a son of the original Sabater hacendado that <br/>\nsettled in Puerto Rico (he wasn&#39;t a slave with a given name but a <br/>\nlegitimate &#39;bastardo&#39;), that would technically make part of my <br/>\nheritage Jewish!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been pondering your book question and really, the only answer is <br/>\nto get a dictionary with a really good etymological section or, just <br/>\nfor kicks, a good etymological dictionary.

I <br/>\nalso love Larrouse on the web.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally have been avoiding formal education in Latin because I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think I can go through learning however many conjugations it <br/>\nhas --I had enough with Spanish, French & Portuguese. Still, if you <br/>\nare not afraid of an academic text you should check out Historia de <br/>\nla Lengua Española by Rafael Lapesa. It is a classic and I am <br/>\nassuming that there are translations out there. As I said, it is an <br/>\nacademic text but makes really interesting reading. As to the Jewish <br/>\nand Muslim influence in Spanish culture, you can start with Américo <br/>\nCastro&#39;s classic, La realidad histórica de España.<br/>\n<br/>\nGotta go, Aidan is being ornery --gotta get the Spawn and Beast out <br/>\nof the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLiza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Totally cool post, Liza!

I think you might really like the mother in &quot;Davita&#39;s Harp&quot; -- a novel by Chaim Potok.

It dawned on me","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-90803167\">Hi all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am delurking big time for a moment of geekatude.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverytime I start writing a reply to the Phonics thread I stop and <br/>\nnow I know why. It dawned on me just now that you are not talking <br/>\nabout Phonetics but of something else. A lot of these terms are <br/>\nactually more of a US thing, so my question is, am I to assume that <br/>\nPhonics is Phonetics without a context?<br/>\n<br/>\nSpanish is my native language. I grew up in Puerto Rico where I <br/>\nlearned English alongside Spanish. I do not know how the techniques <br/>\nof ESOL have changed but I can say that, while I was in school there, <br/>\nwe learned everything based on three principles: Phonetics, Etymology <br/>\nand Ortography. This is how Spanish has always been taught, even in <br/>\nthis country. I cannot imagine learning a language any other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can you learn what a word sounds like without knowing why; <br/>\nespecially in a country like the US, where regional accents can <br/>\nboondoggle drastically a word&#39;s original sound? If Phonics is indeed <br/>\nPhonetics without a context, I can see why all the craziness. It does <br/>\nnot mean that a child has to sit down everyday and do academic work. <br/>\nIt means, though, that, when learning a new word, if you do not know <br/>\nwhy it is spelled a certain way, just get your dictionary out and <br/>\nfind the reason for it. This usually clarifies the sounds and <br/>\nspellings of words.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also is a cool game of sleuthing. My brother and I would spend <br/>\nhours just going through dictionaries trying to find as many links <br/>\nbetween Spanish and English words as we could find. And once I <br/>\nlearned other languages (French and Portuguese), it has turned into a <br/>\nlife long obsession. Let&#39;s take the word JOURNAL, for example. This <br/>\nis what I found on Yahoo! American Heritage Dictionary:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;journal<br/>\n&gt;SYLLABICATION:\tjour·nal<br/>\n&gt;PRONUNCIATION:\tAUDIO: jûrnl     KEY<br/>\n&gt;NOUN:<br/>\n&gt;1a. A personal record of occurrences, experiences, and reflections <br/>\n&gt;kept on a regular basis; a diary. b. An official record of daily <br/>\n&gt;proceedings, as of a legislative body. c. Nautical A ship&#39;s log.<br/>\n&gt;2. Accounting a. A daybook. b. A book of original entry in a <br/>\n&gt;double-entry system, listing all transactions and indicating the <br/>\n&gt;accounts to which they belong.<br/>\n&gt;3. A newspaper.<br/>\n&gt;4. A periodical presenting articles on a particular subject: a <br/>\n&gt;medical journal.<br/>\n&gt;5. The part of a machine shaft or axle supported by a bearing.<br/>\n&gt;ETYMOLOGY:\tMiddle English, breviary, from Old French, daily, <br/>\n&gt;breviary, from Late Latin diurnlis, daily. See diurnal.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now, as a child, up to #5 I would get excited because this would <br/>\nexplain the Spanish words JORNAL [hor-nal] which means day job, and <br/>\nJORNADA [hor-nada] which means day trip. But once I learned French I <br/>\ngot easily the meanings of the words JOUR, JOURNEE, JOURNAL just by <br/>\nlooking at them and guessing ---I already knew what their English and <br/>\nSpanish cousins meant.  Then came Portuguese and JORNAL was not a <br/>\nproblem. Still, check at the etymological explanation. How can the <br/>\nroot of JOURNAL be DIURNAL? When did that D turn into a J? Call me a <br/>\ngeek but here I go:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;diurnal<br/>\n&gt;SYLLABICATION:\tdi·ur·nal<br/>\n&gt;PRONUNCIATION:\tAUDIO: d-ûrnl     KEY<br/>\n&gt;ADJECTIVE:<br/>\n&gt;1. Relating to or occurring in a 24-hour period; daily.<br/>\n&gt;2. Occurring or active during the daytime rather than at night: <br/>\n&gt;diurnal animals.<br/>\n&gt;3. Botany Opening during daylight hours and closing at night.<br/>\n&gt;NOUN:<br/>\n&gt;1. A book containing all the offices for the daily canonical hours <br/>\n&gt;of prayer except matins.<br/>\n&gt;2. Archaic a. A diary or journal. b. A daily newspaper.<br/>\n&gt;ETYMOLOGY:\tMiddle English, from Late Latin diurnlis, from Latin <br/>\n&gt;diurnus, from dis, day. See dyeu- in Appendix I.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, OK. So we see the meaning of diurnal but still have no idea why <br/>\nthe change from D to J. But, WAIT! There is that etymology key at the <br/>\nend. So it is not just a D sound but a DY sound. Now, I did not know <br/>\nthis was the YOD of Romance languages until I was studying to be a <br/>\nSpanish language teacher, STILL, as a kid, I would have killed to <br/>\nhave had a computer that would have given me this kind of information <br/>\nso fast. This would have meant that I would have had to wait until I <br/>\ncould get to a public library and look into a historical dictionary. <br/>\nNow, with the web, it is so easy, so here I go again:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Appendix I<br/>\n&gt;Indo-European Roots<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ENTRY:\tdyeu-<br/>\n&gt;DEFINITION:\tTo shine (and in many derivatives, &quot;sky, heaven, <br/>\n&gt;god&quot;).

How can you not be excited about this! Look at the first item. <br/>\nNow, I grew up Catholic so I would have known from Catholic <br/>\niconography &#39;I&#39; was translated into J, Y or G as in IAN = YANNI = <br/>\nGIANNI = JAN = JOHN = JUAN. So now we are getting somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut WAIT! I had no idea up until today that DYEU means &#39;To shine&#39;! So <br/>\nnow I also know that DIA, DAY, DIEU, DIOS are all the same!!! They <br/>\nare referring to the SUN! Well, check that out!<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT WAIT, now I also know why it is that in Spanish we say DEE-AH, <br/>\nbut in Brazilian Portuguese we say GEE-AH. WOW!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, by the way, was what I would do in my classes. It was the &#39;did <br/>\nyou know&#39; moment. I cannot tell you how much my students, young and <br/>\nold, LOVED those moments. To this day I have former students stop me <br/>\nand thank me for it. A lot of them say they actually ended with <br/>\nminors in Spanish and still others felt they just wanted to learn <br/>\nmore about English and feel grateful for my making it fun and <br/>\ninteresting to them. I do not know what you call this kind of <br/>\nteaching but I know it works. As I always said my students, we have a <br/>\nlifetime to learn. Some know a little bit more than others and that&#39;s <br/>\nwhy they teach; does not mean it is a reason to stop learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould I go on a tangent like this with my 4 year old? Not all the <br/>\ntime, not BUT, time and again, it is by just getting lost in tangents <br/>\nthat he &#39;gets&#39; the meanings of words. I definitely pare it down so I <br/>\nwon&#39;t overwhelm him because I know he will come back to it whenever <br/>\nhe is ready for more. We anyhow have a lifetime to learn these <br/>\nthings. What is important is to have the tools --without the tools, <br/>\nit can be a chore, a pain in the butt or just pure hell. This way, <br/>\nthough, I find is waaaaaaaay more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLiza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nps: I can also read Italian, so that makes 5 languages I can dabble <br/>\nin. My brother dabbles in 4: Spanish, English, German and Arabic <br/>\n--and he is not half the geek I am! Still, I cannot tell you how <br/>\njealous I am that he knows those other two languages. Oh well, back <br/>\nto learning some more ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Phonics, Key to reading [and Numbers,  key to math?)","postDate":"1027799820","msgId":39544,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDcyNzEyNTYxMi4wMWM4YmI4MEBwb3AuaXNsYW5kbmV0LmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDQwMWMyMzU5OSRlZTJkMjY4MCQyN2E2NTYxOEBlZC5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDE3ZS5iYWNmOWU4LjJhNzQzZTJmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39541,"nextInTopic":39546,"prevInTime":39543,"nextInTime":39545,"topicId":39536,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
