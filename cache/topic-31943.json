No sounding out, no figuring, no nothing.  Just started reading.  And hasn&#39;t stopped since. 3 years of reading and he now reads &quot;Scientific American&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, anything!  When he did come across a word he didn&#39;t know, I just gave it to him, didn&#39;t ask him to &quot;sound it out&quot; or anything.  He knows phonics (kids pick that up naturally, I believe)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell...now my youngest 2 aged 5 and 7 have decided to read!  I&#39;ve known for a while that they had the pre-reading skills because we read constantly around here.  They&#39;d do things like &quot;hey mom, moon and monkey start with the same letter!&quot; and they know to read left to right.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we went to the library and picked out BOB books.  They&#39;re very simple - Mat. Mat sat. Mat sat on Sam. etc.  My 7 year old started sounding out the words!  I was very impressed!  He read the books sounding out all the words.  When he came to &quot;the&quot; and &quot;and&quot; I just gave him the words.  My 5 year old appears more like his older brother.  When he comes to word he doesn&#39;t know he might sound the first sound and then just goes with what he thinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so here&#39;s the question.  I have always believed that making children sound out words was cruel and took away from the enjoyment of reading.  YET...my 7 year old seems capable of working it out himself and actually enjoys it.  Should I say &quot;sound it out&quot;?  Any thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I&#39;m just so excited about this!  See, unschooling works!  I just want to walk up to people who don&#39;t always give me such an easy time and say &quot;Look, they can read!  They know phonics!  They never touched a workbook or went to school and listen to a teacher say a is for apple.

It might be helpful to show them how to<br/>\nsound out by syllable at a time when they are not in the middle of<br/>\nreading.  But maybe their brain wants to do it a different way?
