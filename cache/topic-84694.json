The woman who will be taking care of them works part time <br/>\nduring the week, so is mostly home every weekend. I will be taking <br/>\nher children during the week while she works.  When I said I was <br/>\nworried about it being hard on them spending time with her, then time <br/>\nwith me.. I was worried at the time about the kids switching back and <br/>\nforth between projects, but we have talked more, and she usually does <br/>\nmostly art projects during the weekend.. and if they&#39;re in the middle <br/>\nof something here and don&#39;t want to have to wait to finish, i&#39;ll <br/>\nsimply take it to her. It&#39;s actually funny. They&#39;ve only been out of <br/>\nschool 2 days, and I already see a difference in my son. He made <br/>\neveryone breakfast in bed this morning.... this child who usually <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t get up to get his own bowl of cereal or pop-tart... and he <br/>\nhas drawn me 4 pictures this morning, and all included hearts and <br/>\nflowery sayings. I haven&#39;t seen him this relaxed and affectionate in <br/>\na year or more. I should have done this sooner.<br/>\nJennifer</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84575,"nextTopicId":84555}}
