Now, the reasons <br/>\nwe homeschool, and especially unschool, are much different.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSocialization is a big part of that.  We don&#39;t want our children to spend <br/>\ntheir childhood cooped up in a classroom with one teacher and 30 other <br/>\nchildren, all the same age, wearing the same clothes, talking about the same <br/>\nthings and having the same experiences.  Instead, our children have the <br/>\nbenefit of learning to live and thrive in the &quot;real world&quot; from birth, not <br/>\njust from age 18.  We take classes, visit museums and places of business, go <br/>\non field trips, read books, have play dates, attend plays and concerts, go to <br/>\nthe doctor and the grocery store, play sports, organize activities, listen to <br/>\nand play music, do art projects, run the family business, learn how to cook, <br/>\nsew and take care of the house.  With 7 or more hours of school and another <br/>\ncouple hours of homework, school kids don&#39;t have much time for the &quot;real <br/>\nworld&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother big part of our unschooling experience is knowing that we are not <br/>\nsquelching, but rather enhancing and fostering our children&#39;s love of <br/>\nlearning.  We believe that all children from birth have a practically <br/>\ninsatiable thirst for learning and knowledge.  Unfortunately, school saps <br/>\nmost of that thirst from the first day we enter kindergarten.  When we&#39;re in <br/>\nschool we&#39;re not allowed to work on projects that we&#39;re interested in.  When <br/>\nwe are interested in a project or a subject, we&#39;re forced to put it away at <br/>\nthe end of a set time period.  We spend many hours a day on make-work <br/>\nprojects, worksheets and homework to reinforce concepts that we have long <br/>\nsince learned or grown bored with.  We spend much time on administrative <br/>\ntasks necessary to keep 30 kids in line.  We spend much time on classes and <br/>\nactivities that have no relation to the world outside the classroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut aren&#39;t there just some things that everybody needs to know?  I don&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve so.  The body of knowledge is so vast and is changing so rapidly, <br/>\nthat it is now virtually impossible for a traditional school to teach a child <br/>\nwhat he or she will need to make a living and be a productive adult.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLook at computers.  How many of us work in the field of computers?  How many <br/>\nof us learned about computers when we were in school?  Not many, I&#39;ll bet.  <br/>\nWhere and when did we learn what we need to know to make a living?  Maybe <br/>\ncollege, but probably long after we were even in college.  And how rapidly is <br/>\nthe field of computers changing?  And if you did learn marketable skills in <br/>\ncollege, are you still using those skills, or have you changed jobs or <br/>\ncareers?  How much of what you learned in school actually benefits you now?  <br/>\nWhat will the world look like when your child finishes school in 10 or 15 <br/>\nyears?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that in order to get along in the world, what we know isn&#39;t <br/>\nreally very important.  It is more important that we are motivated to learn <br/>\nand have the skills to gain the knowledge that we will need at any point in <br/>\nour lives.  School does very little toward teaching us to love knowledge and <br/>\nlearning.  School is still designed to give us facts, facts that will be <br/>\nuseless to us in 10 or 15 years.  Worse still, school squelches our love of <br/>\nlearning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe believe that homeschooling, and unschooling in particular, fosters a love <br/>\nof learning.  We spend much time discerning what it is that we need or want <br/>\nto know, then learning how to find it.  What better preparation can there be? <br/>\n A 15 minute lecture in the library on how to use the card catalogue?  A 30 <br/>\nminute lecture in how to organize a term paper?  No, we get our hands dirty.  <br/>\nWe learn how to work with the librarian, how to experiment with the catalogue <br/>\ncomputer.  We learn how to ask questions -- by doing it!  We don&#39;t write term <br/>\npapers.  We read everything we can get our hands on about a subject.  We <br/>\ndon&#39;t take tests because there&#39;s no one to answer to but ourselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs unschoolers we&#39;ll learn what we need to learn when we need to.  As my <br/>\nchildren grow, I have confidence that they will learn to read, but even more <br/>\nconfidence that they will continue to love books, because they will not be <br/>\nworried about whether someone is going to test them on what they know.  I <br/>\nhave confidence that they will learn to manipulate numbers, but even more <br/>\nconfidence that they will not be afraid of math, because they will not be <br/>\nworried about whether they&#39;re going to pass an algebra class.  Instead, <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be thinking about how to apply what they&#39;ve learned to that robotics <br/>\nproblem.  And, if they don&#39;t learn math?  It will be because they never <br/>\nreally needed it after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve come such a long way in our thinking over the past few years about <br/>\nhomeschooling in general and unschooling in particular.  And a big part of <br/>\nour evolution included many opportunities to talk to people who&#39;ve been <br/>\nthrough it.  Books and e-mail messages are great, but one-to-one contact I <br/>\nthink is vital.  I&#39;d like to invite anybody who&#39;d like to talk about this to <br/>\ncontact me.  As you can see, I do love to go on and on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCarron</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Shirley A Richardson-McCourt","from":"&quot;Shirley A Richardson-McCourt&quot; &lt;thediva@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"I9JDZWQ3wBFs9AXijOn37jNlwtA9AN0ncqwPrQTxH3CWs8wSTcl71xRQHcbRJDTFVFNSzJW0Cvrh0YOZDoYo5Cs9Gw9LuHSJyV_geTVYhqg7HQMLXTZqytmM-pjqiJsr","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] help-why unschool?","postDate":"967891862","msgId":12407,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZTMwMWMwMTRkMSRlMDhlMGNhMCRiNDZhNGMwY0BvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDAwOTAxMjAyMy5lODFLTm5iMTA0ODRAc20wMTAxLnByb21lZGlhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":12381,"nextInTopic":12429,"prevInTime":12406,"nextInTime":12408,"topicId":12365,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Lynda: How long did it take your son to deschool?

(I bet you&#39;ll stump him.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think most people who insist on school attendance believe two things:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Forced memorization is the best or only way to learn things.  No pain, no <br/>\ngain.  &quot;I would never have chosen to learn this stuff.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n2) An inherent belief that it is safer and better to do things the way they <br/>\nhave been done before.  (Repeating the same schooling pattern the parent <br/>\nhad.)  An ingrained belief that one&#39;s schooling was &quot;good for&quot; oneself, and <br/>\nthus that it must be necessary to inflict an education like this on everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe counter arguments to #1 are:<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Watch a child learn to walk and speak a first language.  Both are <br/>\nextremely difficult tasks.  The child undertakes these tasks willingly and <br/>\nmakes much more rapid progress than an adult would.  Drills are not <br/>\nnecessary.  The child finds his or her own opportunities to practice, when <br/>\nready.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Look back at what you really did learn in 12 years of schooling.  How much <br/>\nscience did you learn in elementary school?  In middle school?  Can you solve <br/>\na physics problem or balance a chemical equation to save your life?  If you <br/>\nstudied a foreign language, can you speak it at all, beyond just saying Hello?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to run, but maybe you can come up with good counter arguments for <br/>\npoint 2 yourself.  I&#39;m having a hard time getting past &quot;Duh.... get a clue!&quot;  <br/>\n(And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s very persuasive. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  (I think setting aside all argument and getting your BIL to reminisce <br/>\nabout his school experiences is helpful.  It&#39;s good to see where he is coming <br/>\nfrom.  I hope he can remember both good and bad things about going to school. <br/>\n I swear some men are so un-introspective they don&#39;t remember anything that <br/>\nhappened to them... at least they don&#39;t access these memories when they <br/>\ndiscuss sending their kids to school.  I think sometimes it&#39;s due to too much <br/>\nemotional scar tissue... but I don&#39;t know.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(Men, I apologize for generalizing.... but I have seen an awful lot of <br/>\nboneheadedness, from dads, on the &quot;need&quot; for the schooling experience.  Ugh.  <br/>\nMost moms, again generalizing, are less sold on any experience that involves <br/>\nmaking their children suffer.)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"marbleface@aol.com","from":"marbleface@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"-HLdrhgcpQVHYDLKmkcLh0jsHd1_UK5qX0C5eyhr-yi_YH8QJC_CUdUVqxWjaipCvnxN-_nGe0__","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] help-why unschool?","postDate":"967813036","msgId":12366,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNiLjk2OTcwMTQuMjZlMTAxYWNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12365,"nextInTopic":12371,"prevInTime":12365,"nextInTime":12367,"topicId":12365,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 09/01/2000 12:25:19 PM !!!First Boot!!!, Jaam1224@cs.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1588177984\">In a message dated 09/01/2000 12:25:19 PM !!!First Boot!!!, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jaam1224@...\">Jaam1224@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; So, I was wondering if you would take a few minutes to write &quot;why <br/>\n you unschool&quot; so I can pass on your thoughts.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi BIL --<br/>\n<br/>\nWe unschool/relaxed homeschool because the education the school system was <br/>\noffering was completely inadequate to meet the needs of our two children.  <br/>\nThe kids are bright and the class was geared toward the lower end of the <br/>\nspectrum.  There was little flexibility in the school&#39;s approach -- sending <br/>\nmy son up a grade for reading once a day was the best they had.<br/>\n<br/>\nBIL -- you are right to be wary of this or any method of hsing!  Your house <br/>\nand your life will be taken over.  You will become completely immersed in the <br/>\nlearning that your children are doing.  There will be books everywhere.  You <br/>\nwill need at least one more computer.  Your children will never be able to <br/>\njust walk thru anywhere -- the zoo will take twice as long because they will <br/>\nhave to stop and examine the animals and comment and add what they know.  <br/>\nThey will actually pay attention to the world around them and this makes life <br/>\nmove more slowly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd your wife -- you will not recognize her after a while.  She will be <br/>\ncovered with poster paint and glue and will be running to the book store or <br/>\nthe music lessons or the office supply store or the library at all hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd she will need your help.  The kids will not be content to just know what <br/>\none book says.  They will want to know what you, Dad, think about things.  <br/>\nThey will ask you approximately 1,000,000 questions a day and expect you to <br/>\nactually help them find the answers.  They will get better at this as they <br/>\nget older and learn how to do research all by themselves but . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nRun now, Dad.
