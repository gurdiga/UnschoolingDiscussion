I think they are missing the biggest element of the <br/>\nunschooling philosophy: that children *can* be trusted and respected. <br/>\nThat they *want* to be good people and *need* to feel appreciated for <br/>\nwho they are, when they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling only academically just doesn&#39;t get to the *point*.

Fill me in...is there a rift  between these communities <br/>\nthat I&#39;m unaware of?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t think there&#39;s a rift, necessarily.  After all, unschoolers  aren&#39;t <br/>\nsome monolithic &quot;community&quot; to have a riff with.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t believe the two philosophies are incompatible with each  other.  I do <br/>\nbelieve they are very different and very separate.  To  me, NCP/TCS puts the <br/>\nchild clearly at the center of the universe, AND creates a  vacuum around them <br/>\nthat implies their actions don&#39;t influence or harm or benefit  others.  <br/>\nUnschooling embraces and encourages the interdependence and  mutuality of <br/>\nrelationship between parent and child.  An unschooling parent  wouldn&#39;t have any <br/>\nproblems with asking their child to conider the parent&#39;s  feelings, needs and <br/>\ndesires in the child&#39;s decisions.  In my experience  with NCP/TCS, the child can <br/>\nflat out refuse to consider anyone else&#39;s feelings,  needs and desires, and the <br/>\nparent would be philosophy-bound not to coerce them  in any way, regardless of <br/>\nthe direness of the situation. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe various applications of this philosophy that have been discussed in the  <br/>\n10 years I&#39;ve been online were always in the hypothetical, with no real-life  <br/>\nexamples of win-win.  It&#39;s always a discussion of what &quot;might&quot; work or what  <br/>\n&quot;could&quot; work, and unschoolers usually can point to something in their  <br/>\nunschooling lives that &quot;has&quot; worked.  That&#39;s not a criticism of the  philosophy <br/>\nitself, I suppose, but an example of how difficult it is to gain an  understanding <br/>\nof the philosophy as compared to unschooling.  <br/>\n <br/>\nUnderstanding NCP/TCS can helped me understand unschooling better.   It&#39;s can <br/>\nbe a subtle difference in any given situation, and so it&#39;s hard to  explain.  <br/>\nI do carry with me a natural gut-check about coersion because of  those <br/>\ndiscussions, but it always bumps up against my instincts for relationship,  <br/>\npracticality and self-preservation.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOne of the greatest things I learned from the NCP/TCS discussions was the  <br/>\nideas about time coersion and money coersion.  I have a tendency to rush if  I&#39;m <br/>\nlate, to my detriment and that of my children.  Recognizing that it&#39;s  the <br/>\n*time constraints* that is making me rush has helped me be more calm and  <br/>\npeaceful with myself and my kids.

What I&#39;ve seen of non rift is when a family really likes the NCP <br/>\nphilosophy and jumps straight to that, and it makes their unschooling easier.   <br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve seen of rift is when TCS/NCP people criticize unschoolers for ANY <br/>\npersuasion or inspiration (saying it&#39;s coercive) and criticize unschoolers for <br/>\nsharing personal details of their children&#39;s lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd from the unschooling point of view (online discussions over a dozen <br/>\nyears),  when someone says &quot;I believe this&quot; and another says &quot;How has it worked <br/>\nout?&quot; and the answer is &quot;I&#39;m not going to tell you,&quot; it seems a waste of time to <br/>\ndiscuss it much more.  But that, I think, is because many unschoolers came out <br/>\nof La Leche League and other experience-sharing groups and mutual help groups <br/>\nin which sharing was the core of the whole situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in a way, unschooling is more scientific because we will share evidence <br/>\nfreely back and forth and let other people unschoolers meet and talk with our <br/>\nkids behind our backs (maybe not all unschoolers, but LOTS).   The very few <br/>\nTCS/NCP people who will share ANYthing won&#39;t share real life stories.   Their take <br/>\nseems to be that if the premise is sound that results aren&#39;t the point.  I <br/>\nthink (and could be wrong) that the premise takes great precedence over the <br/>\nchild&#39;s happiness and wellbeing, and it seems to me (personally) that NCP can be a <br/>\ncop-out for parents who don&#39;t have much natural interpersonal skill, and so <br/>\nthey want a cool set of rules to fall back on (and to blame if the outcome <br/>\nisn&#39;t ideal).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the unschoolers I&#39;ve liked and respected most, the outcome and the <br/>\nprocess WERE important, and the methods were tweaked to get a better outcome (peace, <br/>\ncloseness, learning, joy).   <br/>\n<br/>\nAt La Leche League meetings moms hear birth stories and see the babies and <br/>\nknow their names and watch other moms nurse babies and really learn from seeing <br/>\nand knowing.  If the philosophy didn&#39;t work, they would see it right away, <br/>\nclearly.   If unschooling didn&#39;t work, no one would come to it new, because they <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t see any results to be aimed for or families to be emulated.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people reconcile the two in their own minds, but I haven&#39;t seen <br/>\nreconciliation of the methods of helping others understand and implement.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":220780607,"authorName":"cordjax","from":"&quot;cordjax&quot; &lt;cordjax@...&gt;","profile":"cordjax","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Not really unschoolers","postDate":"1114605471","msgId":105637,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ0bzEyditvYzhmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGQ0bnZxZCszMjkyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":105636,"nextInTopic":105638,"prevInTime":105636,"nextInTime":105638,"topicId":105602,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just a quick follow up.

I think the schools degrade both science and religion, and<br/>\ndo not encourage either strong faith or strong critical thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome feel that the school curriculum is dull, fragmented, devoid of<br/>\ncontext, in George Dennison&#39;s words, that it destroys &quot;the continuum<br/>\nof experience.&quot; Others may feel that the school curriculum is fine,<br/>\nbut that they don&#39;t do a very good job of teaching it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is important is not that all readers of GWS should agree on<br/>\nthese questions, but that we should respect our differences while we<br/>\nwork for what we agree on, our right and the right of all people to<br/>\ntake their children out of schools, and help, plan, or direct their<br/>\nlearning in the ways they think best.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all these matters, we at GWS have our own opinions, and will<br/>\nexpress them.

And &quot;unschooling&quot; was his word for not sending kids to school - <br/>\nno matter what kind of schooling they might have been getting at home. <br/>\nThe meaning has changed, since then. Billy Geer, at FUNBooks, has a <br/>\nnice little explanation of that development.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days, unschooling generaly simply means &quot;not schooling&quot; - it <br/>\nmeans not imposing schooling on their kids - school-at-home or &quot;just <br/>\nmath&quot; or any other schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people want to nitpick about how John Holt used a term - they need <br/>\nto read what he said about the word, &quot;education.&quot; I&#39;m not saying they <br/>\nneed to stop using the word, just that they need to realize that how <br/>\nJohn Holt happened to define something on any particular occasion might <br/>\nbe very interesting, but should not be considered the final say. Hence, <br/>\nHEM, for example, felt free to name their magazine Home &quot;EDUCATION&quot; <br/>\nMagazine, in spite of this definition of the word, education, by John <br/>\nHolt.<br/>\n<br/>\n  John Holt wrote this about &quot;education&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I choose to define it here as most people do, something that some <br/>\npeople<br/>\ndo to others for their own good, molding and shaping them, and trying to<br/>\nmake them learn what they thing they ought to know. Today, everywhere in<br/>\nthe world, that is what &quot;education&quot; has become, and I am wholly against<br/>\nit. People spend a great deal of time- as for years I did myself-<br/>\ntalking about how to make &quot;education&quot; more effective and efficient, or<br/>\nhow to do it or give it to more people, or how to reform or humanize it.<br/>\nBut to make it more effective and efficient will only be to make it<br/>\nworse, and to help it do even more harm. It cannot be reformed, cannot<br/>\nbe carried out wisely or humanely, because its purpose is neither wise<br/>\nnor humane. &quot;<br/>\n~John Holt<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Apr 25, 2005, at 11:19 AM, jimpetersonl wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; There are a variety of definitions of unschooling (Holt&#39;s, for<br/>\n&gt; example, in his advice to Nancy Wallace sounds much more like these<br/>\n&gt; other families you are describing).

If Tuckervill had <br/>\nwaited to find unschoolers just like her (and God knows I&#39;ve never been <br/>\nan unschooler like her) we would have never met her and her kids or all <br/>\nthe other cool families we&#39;ve known over the last 7 years. Nor had the <br/>\nprivilege of witnessing how her &quot;pure unschooling&quot; works which in turn <br/>\nhas inspired other families.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie W<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jwoolfolk.typepad.com/theothermother/\">http://jwoolfolk.typepad.com/theothermother/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9206405,"authorName":"jimpetersonl","from":"&quot;jimpetersonl&quot; &lt;jimpetersonl@...&gt;","profile":"jimpetersonl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Not really unschoolers","postDate":"1114453150","msgId":105605,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ0amNhdSsxMTNiMkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwN2MwMWM1NDliYyQ2NDQ4ZDA2MCQxYzI5OWYxOEBjaGFydGVydG4ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":105604,"nextInTopic":105606,"prevInTime":105604,"nextInTime":105606,"topicId":105602,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You might want to try more patience and less ugh.
