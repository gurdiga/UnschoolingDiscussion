The more I play I think wow I <br/>\ncould really make this more interesting :0) Anyway, I have a friend <br/>\nwho loves different kinds of dice and I bought two cans from her <br/>\ncatolog / web site (essential Mothers - I think ?) they are fron <br/>\nGermany and are so cute. One has #&#39;s and there is a little booklet <br/>\nfor it with some ideas. The other one has the alphabet (all sides)on <br/>\nit and I&#39;m not quite sure what to play with that game. <br/>\nI really love the games because they are fun and Hasbro has come out <br/>\nwith a multitude of games this year (near me anayway)they must be on <br/>\nto the home school community LOL........................<br/>\nI would love to hear from more of you about your favorite games that <br/>\nyou and your children play.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSonya</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82447,"nextTopicId":82451}}
