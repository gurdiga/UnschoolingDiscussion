I can&#39;t answer the question with a <br/>\nyes or no, because I think (correct me if I&#39;m wrong) that you&#39;re equating <br/>\nspanking with being unsafe, and I don&#39;t feel that way. A spanking is not <br/>\ngood, it can damage the relationship with the child, etc. but it does not <br/>\nput their lives in danger.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay so again it seems to be a definition of words. Can&#39;t one be unsafe from <br/>\nhaving harmful words said to them? It&#39;s a different kind of hurt but can&#39;t <br/>\nit be just as detrimental, if not more so? I think most of us would agree on <br/>\nthat. People can say some damaging things that do hurt. Think about the lady <br/>\nin the store with your son. You blame what she said on undoing things you <br/>\nhad done with your son. That caused your son not to be safe did it not? <br/>\nWasn&#39;t he trying to kick you and maybe in turn hurt himself? And do you see <br/>\nit as hurting him psychologically? He trusts a stranger&#39;s word over yours. <br/>\nWords can do harm and make one unsafe in mind. Well spanking does the same <br/>\nthing. It hurts the child. Maybe not on the butt, but look at a childs face <br/>\nwhen they are getting a spanking. It hurts. That&#39;s not safe. So if that <br/>\nchild has the right to be safe, then he needs not be spanked.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChoose an Internet access plan right for you -- try MSN! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/default.asp\">http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/default.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: truths","postDate":"1035422623","msgId":47630,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDIzLjE5MjM0My44NDQuNS5kZHppbWxld0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":47624,"nextInTopic":47638,"prevInTime":47629,"nextInTime":47631,"topicId":47465,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We all know spanking is legal.

They felt so horrible,  these things are just now coming out after 30 to 40 years.  Spanking is emotionally depilitating, to both the person getting spanked and to the siblings around that know that it is happening.

They DON&#39;T necessarily know the situation <br/>\nbest. They wouldn&#39;t bat an eye if we raised our hands to our boys---they&#39;d be <br/>\nnodding in agreement! And be picking the switches for us!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s NOT GOING TO GO AWAY if all the family members believe it&#39;s the right <br/>\nthing to do! CAN&#39;T YOU TWO SEE THIS????<br/>\n<br/>\nIf &quot;the village&quot; believes that abuse is fine, IT WILL HAPPEN!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one family abuses and the village says they&#39;re wrong to do it, it MAY <br/>\nstop.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if Mommy was spanked and Daddy was spanked (as well as the grands and the <br/>\naunts and uncles of that extended family you two think are so important), and <br/>\nthey turned out just fine (and well-behaved after the spanking---right, <br/>\nMike?), WHAT&#39;S TO STOP THEM? THAT VILLAGE???????<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the capital letters mean I&#39;m SHOUTING!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard for me to believe you two would show up at an unschooling list to <br/>\nadvocate spanking----and DON&#39;T TELL ME YOU&#39;RE NOT! It&#39;s obvious to everyone <br/>\nhere but the two of you that we think children (ALL CHILDREN) deserve the <br/>\nsame respect you&#39;d give another adult. What you&#39;re advocating DOESN&#39;T DO <br/>\nTHAT!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey become property. And property that belongs to the &quot;village&quot;. Foxes <br/>\nguarding the hen house. If everyone close to the children thinks that <br/>\nspanking&#39;s OK, IT WILL HAPPEN! None of them will step in to protect the <br/>\nyoungest and most vulnerable. And mental hurt is hurt too. Pain is pain---it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to be physical.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve chosen to remove ourselves and our boys from that family village you <br/>\nthink should intervene (but WON&#39;T). We&#39;ve made out own community of <br/>\nlike-minded people who value children as young humans, not grubs. All my <br/>\nfriends speak respectfully to my boys (well, John Tudor doesn&#39;t do a very <br/>\ngood job in a crowd, but he&#39;s great one-on-one! &lt;G&gt;) and treat them as they <br/>\nwould like to be treated. My boys are JUST as respectful in return. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re telling you things that WORK and that are gentle and kind and joyful <br/>\nand giving and sweet. You&#39;re saying, yeah, but spanking works too---for some <br/>\npeople (because they&#39;re the parents) and we shouldn&#39;t interfere. You&#39;re on an <br/>\nUNSCHOOLING LIST! <br/>\n<br/>\nAs Sandra said, there are lists that will agree with you. THIS ONE WON&#39;T<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47477,"nextTopicId":47852}}
