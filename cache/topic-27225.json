I personally have found it a<br/>\nsaving grace for me this year. I am a single parent<br/>\nthat has recently moved into a new community and I am<br/>\nlooking for work and not finding much available to do<br/>\nfrom home. Therefore I am finding it a real struggle<br/>\nto survive financially at the moment. The &quot;budget&quot; I<br/>\nhave been given has helped me to aquire the materials<br/>\nthat I would like to use to unschool my daughter in a<br/>\nwaldorfy manner.I have to say though, I&#39;m hoping that<br/>\nI&#39;ll be in a better financial situation next year (or<br/>\nsooner, I hope!) and then I will choose to take her<br/>\nout of the program (mainly because I don&#39;t like the<br/>\ntesting thing). I don&#39;t feel as though I have been<br/>\n&quot;sucked in&quot; and I also know that I am free to leave at<br/>\nany time and file an R4 (in CA). Regardless of my<br/>\nfinancial situation, if they started changing the<br/>\nrequirements (and giving me less freedom) I would pull<br/>\nher out in a second! Also I belong to a great,<br/>\nsupportive homeschool group in my area that I found<br/>\nthrough HSC. We are a very diverse group. Some of us<br/>\nuse public charter school programs, others use a<br/>\nprivate homeschool program and yet others do the R4<br/>\nthing. So I think there is room for everyone.<br/>\nMeghan<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nMake a great connection at Yahoo!
