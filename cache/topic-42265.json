I was visiting <br/>\ncousins in Dallas, Tx. and my Aunt took us to see A Midsummer&#39;s Nights Dream <br/>\nat the local Shakespeare in the park production.

I was miserable, so I <br/>\nfound a copy that didn&#39;t have all the directions and still, I didn&#39;t *see* in <br/>\nthe book what I saw on stage. I have tried over the years to read Shakespeare <br/>\nand am always left with this feeling that I am not getting it! Maybe someday <br/>\nI will find a book on how to read Shakespeare, or someone will show me what I <br/>\nam missing. Once a boyfriend tried to help me, he told me to read with my <br/>\nheartbeat...
