Let me<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; say that I took my daughter out of school last December, we started off<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; school at home. That was a nightmare!! My daughter goes in two directions<br/>\n&gt; either she catches on real fast and then gets bored  to death or she has a<br/>\n&gt; hard time and gets really frustrated and starts with the poor me , Im so<br/>\n&gt; dumb, or Im stupid. The latter part of it really bothers me. So began the<br/>\n&gt; unschooling journey, I have read and reread all the books I can get my<br/>\nhands<br/>\n&gt; on (lucky for me I love to read.) Any way it was very hard for me to see<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; big picture and still is , we started officially unschooling in April of<br/>\nlast<br/>\n&gt; year and all seemed well in the beginning ..After reading the books again<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; reading the posts on the list , I felt confident to go with it. I have<br/>\nspent<br/>\n&gt; the last 6 months watching my daughter sit in front of the t.v. or play<br/>\n&gt; gameboy(Im with the mother who said she would like to throw gameboy out<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; window)some days she does nothing but eat all day. Let me just say I think<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; this point I have very little tongue left as I have bitten right off<br/>\ntrying<br/>\n&gt; to keep my nagging mouth shut. Everyone says this is the de-schooling<br/>\nstage<br/>\n&gt; and I should let her be. So I have. I have spent many sleepless nights<br/>\n&gt; wondering if what I feel in my heart could truely be what is right in my<br/>\n&gt; head. I love the idea of unschooling but the schoolish part of me needs to<br/>\n&gt; see results. We are required by law in NH to test once a year. We did that<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; July with the PASS Test from Hewitt Resources. I JUST recieved the results<br/>\n&gt; Friday. She did really good. 90th% on the nationals  ( with no help from<br/>\nme<br/>\n&gt; other than organizing the pages)<br/>\n&gt; I am so sorry to go on but this week has been very difficult for me.<br/>\nBefore<br/>\n&gt; we started unschooling my daughter loved to read , draw, make concoctions<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; the kitchen. (which I hated) Now when she says shes bored and I suggest<br/>\nshe<br/>\n&gt; read one of the million books I have bought for her, she replies with &quot;Mom<br/>\n,<br/>\n&gt; I dont want to do school work.&quot;  when the &quot;school&quot; year started this sept.<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; thought I would be prepared for ALL the great things that would happen so<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; ordered all kinds of books  like Cartooning for beginners and Easy drawing<br/>\n&gt; lessons  and How to draw animals. She has not touched them. I bought  The<br/>\nBig<br/>\n&gt; Book of How. and other reference materials , nothing specific , just stuff<br/>\n&gt; that she could use if she had a motivation. I DID NOT push them on her ,<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; let her know they were there if she wanted them. I have mentioned music<br/>\n&gt; lessons and theater(shes a Drama Qween)  She takes Riding lessons  and<br/>\nloves<br/>\n&gt; that but shows no interest in the two horses that we own. She is an only<br/>\n&gt; child and is lonely sometimes but when I bring up a support group (we even<br/>\n&gt; went to one) she shrugs it off. When I suggested 4-H  she had no interest.<br/>\nOr<br/>\n&gt; she replies with &quot;Mom , that is so queer&quot; Truthfully at this point I am at<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; complete loss .Now I am having a problem with family members. I had<br/>\nmentioned<br/>\n&gt; to my sister that Kearstins test results came in and she did really good<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; them. She said that was great. But while we are on the subject I wanted to<br/>\n&gt; talk to you about this homeschooling thing. (None of my family members<br/>\n&gt; supports me on this , except my wonderful husband.) So of course I was a<br/>\n&gt; little on gaurd. She said that my family had a &quot; Family Discussion&quot; about<br/>\nme<br/>\n&gt; and that they felt that homeschooling was not in &quot;The Best Interest of<br/>\n&gt; Kearstin&quot; as there is no  structure and every kid needs stucture!!! I was<br/>\n&gt; livid at first . My reaction was who the hell are you to discuss my family<br/>\n&gt; and who do you think you are telling me that I might unknowingly hurt my<br/>\n&gt; child . My poor sister was elected by the family to have this talk with me<br/>\n&gt; because she is the most likely to be open and compassionate.??? She said<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; is was discussed that maybe someone should make a phone call to child<br/>\n&gt; services so that I would comply with my familys wishes and send my<br/>\ndaughter<br/>\n&gt; back to school where she will recieve stucture!!!  You will be happy to<br/>\nknow<br/>\n&gt; that I did not lose control.,...... or my temper I did not even raise my<br/>\n&gt; voice. I talked it out with my sister I put myself in there shoes and<br/>\nthought<br/>\n&gt; how I could explain my views and hopes. She felt aweful and asked me if I<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; mad at her. I said no Im not mad. I am hurt and disappointed that nobody<br/>\n&gt; called me to ask me in the first place . That if they were so concerned<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; would have gone to the bookstore and read up on homeschooling and<br/>\nunschooling<br/>\n&gt; and tryed to see where I was coming from. That really it was none of their<br/>\n&gt; business how I bring up my daughter, but because they said they were<br/>\n&gt; concerned I would try to help them understand.  I asked my sister that if<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; brought her some books , would she read them and try to at least get an<br/>\nidea<br/>\n&gt; of unschooling. Then at least even if she dosnt agree she will know why<br/>\nshe<br/>\n&gt; dosnt agree. I told her I wouldnt change my mind about unschooling because<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; believe in my heart that its the right thing to do. But that I would keep<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; family updated on her progress. (as soon as I figure that one out.)<br/>\n&gt; So I left there feeling very unsure of myself and found myself questioning<br/>\n&gt; yet again if I really knew what I was  doing. I talked with my husband (<br/>\nwho<br/>\n&gt; just about went through the roof when I told him of the family discussion)<br/>\n&gt; But he assured me that we were doing fine and we should keep waiting for<br/>\n&gt; Kearstin to show signs of Motivation. If any kind soul would like to send<br/>\nout<br/>\n&gt; some advice or reassurences. I would be most grateful as I turn to the<br/>\nlists<br/>\n&gt; for my support.
