Enuresis alarms are a very <br/>\neffective treatment if the child wants to use one. Not waking when <br/>\nthe alarm goes off is quite common and often parents have to be <br/>\nsupportive and help wake the child up.<br/>\n<br/>\nBedwetting is technically called nocturnal enuresis over here (UK).<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally there is a big difference between primary nocturnal <br/>\nenuresis which is where the person has always had a problem being <br/>\ndry at night and secondary nocturnal enuresis where a person has <br/>\nbeen dry for some time and then starts to be wet at night. Primary <br/>\nis primarily developmental/maturational and will usually stop by the <br/>\ntime a person reaches puberty, alarms can help. With secondary <br/>\nenuresis there is usually an emotional/psychological cause, or <br/>\nsometimes an illness, so secondary is more cause for concern than <br/>\nprimary.<br/>\n<br/>\nWaking when an enuresis alarm goes off has a different effect from <br/>\njust waking a child to take them to the loo. What I was trying <br/>\ninitially to say was that waking or lifting a child up in the night <br/>\nto take them to loo in the hope that it will prevent or stop <br/>\nbedwetting will not work. In fact it can have a negative effect and <br/>\nprolong the bedwetting in to adult hood.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child wants a bed alarm as they want to stop wetting the bed <br/>\nand parent wakes them as the child doesn&#39;t hear the alarm has a <br/>\ndifferent effect from arbitrary waking. <br/>\n<br/>\nGot these stats below off a UK enuresis support site. This is an <br/>\namazingly common problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nBedwetting often runs in families and affects over half a million <br/>\nchildren between the ages of 6 and 16 in the UK. So your children <br/>\nare by no means isolated. In fact, according to surveys taken in <br/>\nGreat Britain, Holland, New Zealand and Ireland in 1998, the number <br/>\nof children who regularly wet the bed average: <br/>\n1 in 6 five year olds <br/>\n1 in 7 seven year olds <br/>\n1 in 11 nine year olds <br/>\n1 in 50-100 fifteen year olds and older [including adults] <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                          BWs Elaine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132394532,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day!","from":"&quot;Have a Nice Day!&quot; &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"litlrooh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] the alarm WAS Bedwetting-couple questions","postDate":"1135784879","msgId":110869,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYWIwMWM2MGJjNiQxNDZmNWFiMCQ1MTFhODk0NUBrcmlzdGVueDMxZHZkOD4=","referencesHeader":"PGRvcm1naSs0cGhkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NkMwMzU3NzAtNTg1Qi00NTNBLUE0NjQtMEM4ODgzNTgzRjQyQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8MkQ4NjU1MEItMDU1Qi00NUEyLThBOTMtNkQ5NTM1MTk1N0Q1QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+IDw0M0IyMTc4My40MDEwNzA0QGdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":110868,"nextInTopic":110870,"prevInTime":110868,"nextInTime":110870,"topicId":110839,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What happened to you is awful.

My oldest daughter is a VERY sound sleeper - still is at 21  <br/>\n  &gt;years old. She was still wetting the bed every night, at 8 or 9 years  <br/>\n  &gt;old. This was hard on her - she REALLY didn&#39;t want to do it, but she  <br/>\n  &gt;slept a lot - about 12 hours per night, and she slept VERY deeply. A  <br/>\n  &gt;neighbor loaned us one of the little underpants alarm thingies - it  <br/>\n  &gt;turns out that kids often &quot;leak&quot; a little urine before they really  <br/>\n  &gt;let it all out. The alarm senses this moisture and sounds JUST before  <br/>\n  &gt;the child is about to really wet.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Roya wore it for about a week, but it only went off one time - she  <br/>\n  &gt;never wet the bed again.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!
