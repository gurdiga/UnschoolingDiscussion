We have the responsiblity as good parents to not<br/>\nbring more children into this world that we can&#39;t provide for.  This<br/>\nmeans emotionally and educationally as well as financially.  Clearly,<br/>\nthose who don&#39;t want more children, should NOT have more children.  Why<br/>\nwould we want more unwanted children in this world?   We need to enjoy<br/>\nand appreciate and honor and provide for the children that already exist<br/>\nbefore adding more to the lot!  Wonderful for you that your family is<br/>\ncapable of this.  Most families are not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the longest time I thought that I wanted 3 children.  Now that I<br/>\nhave two, I am strongly believing more and more every day that 2 is my<br/>\npersonal limit.  I love my children with everything in me.  I spend<br/>\npractically 24 hours a day with them and I treasure every second (even<br/>\nthose hard ones).  However, I am realistic.  My children wear me out. <br/>\nMy children cost A LOT!  There are times with two when I am home alone<br/>\nthat I cannot physically meet both of their needs.  How would I do this<br/>\nwith more than what I have?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love seeing happy and healthy large families.  Those that are<br/>\nfulfilled seem SO fulfilled.  I envy them.  I look at them and see<br/>\nchildren that aren&#39;t as demanding as mine and I think that perhaps that<br/>\nis HOW their parents were capable of being good parents to the number of<br/>\nchildren in their family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might be more capable of properly caring for more children in the<br/>\nfuture.  I&#39;ll keep that option open for a little while, but not for too<br/>\nlong since when I have an infant in the house my oldest gets neglected<br/>\nand that is not fair to her.  However, I am very concerned about the<br/>\nworld overpopulation problem and I can&#39;t justify another pregnancy for<br/>\nme.  If I have more children, it will be through adoption or an<br/>\naccidental pregnancy (and I work very hard to make sure the latter won&#39;t<br/>\nhappen).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lisa in AZ</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120413350,"authorName":"Troy Brown","from":"&quot;Troy Brown&quot; &lt;troybro@...&gt;","profile":"troybro2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: little ones growing","postDate":"1033929778","msgId":45486,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY4MXJkdXNsdUNCY0tmRXh2V3YwMDAxMDg4MUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":45479,"nextInTopic":45488,"prevInTime":45485,"nextInTime":45487,"topicId":45263,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How about a remedy for a selfish, totally unsupportive husband??

You wouldn&#39;t tell someone with a broken leg to just stop<br/>\n&gt; walking because his leg hurts, you tell them to go get the broken<br/>\n&gt; bone set and a cast on it.  I think it&#39;s the same thing with people<br/>\n&gt; who don&#39;t enjoy their children, have no desire to be with their<br/>\n&gt; children or have any more children.  It&#39;s not the having children<br/>\n&gt; part that&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s something more emotionally that the parents<br/>\n&gt; need to deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s probably true in many cases.  But I don&#39;t believe that a<br/>\nperson who doesn&#39;t want children at all or only wants one or two is<br/>\nnecessarily emotionally wounded.  For some people, been there done that<br/>\nhappens after one or two.  For others it happens when the kids stop<br/>\nhappening.  Who&#39;s to say one is better than the other.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m against guilting people into having more children than they<br/>\n&gt; really want.  I&#39;m even against encouraging people to have more<br/>\n&gt; children than they really want.  What I do think is good is to<br/>\n&gt; encourage people to see what a joy being with your kids can be.  To<br/>\n&gt; see children as blessings rather than burdens.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To this point, I agree with you, and helping people to experience that joy<br/>\nwould help so many children.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo heal emotionally<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so that they can see that those female hormones that make us want to<br/>\n&gt; desire more children are a good, natural thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is where we part company.  For one thing, not everyone seems to<br/>\nexperience those hormones as a desire for children.  I don&#39;t believe that<br/>\neveryone who lacks that desire is in need of emotional healing, though I&#39;m<br/>\nsure some are.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The problem with Andrea wasn&#39;t having another baby, it was the<br/>\n&gt; depression.

Maybe she could have coped in a few<br/>\nyears.  Who knows?  But she certainly wasn&#39;t able to at that time.  What I<br/>\ngot from all those news stories was that she (or her husband) felt it would<br/>\nbe *wrong* to delay another child.<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: little ones growing","postDate":"1033865748","msgId":45453,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY0NUZoS2t0a3BnbmtUbGhrUUwwMDAwMGQ2ZUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":45444,"nextInTopic":45460,"prevInTime":45452,"nextInTime":45454,"topicId":45263,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1202664230\">&lt;&lt;It really isn&#39;t different, but we&#39;ve all felt this I&#39;m sure.

Children<br/>\nhave needs: emotional, spiritual, and physical. Meeting those needs fully<br/>\ntakes a whole, mature and secure parenting unit. What I&#39;ve seen in a lot of<br/>\nbig families, not all by any means, but many of them, is that the needs of the<br/>\nparents come first. The older children end up parenting the younger children<br/>\nand the older children do not usually have the experience, wisdom, or strength<br/>\nto parent the younger children in the family in the way that children deserve<br/>\nto be parented. Many children in big families do not get enough of a parent&#39;s<br/>\ntime or energy. This was probably just as true in the past as it is today, but<br/>\nin the past at least food wasn&#39;t as expensive or supportive help as hard to<br/>\nget and keep. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this day and age, they must also be financially secure. If one doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nenough money then life is a daily struggle: teeth don&#39;t get fixed and children<br/>\ndon&#39;t get taken to doctors when they need it. I have met many children of<br/>\nlarge families who choose to have no or few children just because they learned<br/>\nclose up just what those restrictions can mean to the individual. I also know<br/>\nparents of families who loved the baby years but find the older teen years a<br/>\nliving hell and although they love all of their children, acknowledge that<br/>\nthey really didn&#39;t understand how difficult, both emotionally and financially,<br/>\nraising so many children to adulthood would be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are happy, wonderful, strong, secure big families out there, but, they<br/>\nare also the ones with the resources, both emotional and financial, to support<br/>\nthem. Just as a having a partner doesn&#39;t make one whole, having a child<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make one mature and responsible. We need to do the work on ourselves<br/>\nso that we can give to others rather than take. Too many people have children<br/>\nand use them to meet their own needs. We see these walking wounded around us<br/>\ndaily. Maybe we were those walking wounded ourselves and have worked years to<br/>\ngrow and mature to the point where we can give instead of just take. Bringing<br/>\nlife into this world should never be just about how it makes US feel. And<br/>\nlet&#39;s be honest, most of us here have had and nursed babies. Those hormones<br/>\nare powerful. They make us feel GOOD. But being responsible is more than<br/>\nkeeping those baby hormones going. Maybe some young mothers don&#39;t even realize<br/>\njust how powerful those hormones are?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAre those who advocate for large families really concerned with the growth of<br/>\neach individual to its maximum potential? Or are their motives based in the<br/>\nfear &quot;other&quot; and so they encourage the increase of &quot;us&quot; against &quot;them&quot;? I<br/>\nthink it is natural to be concerned about &quot;other&quot;. I think we all have a bit<br/>\nof this fear inside of us. I absolutely believe that each family has the right<br/>\nto determine how many children they will have, but I also believe that they<br/>\nhave the obligation to parent each child in their family so that their<br/>\nemotional, spiritual, and physical needs are met.

She was 9 at the <br/>\ntime and I had seen one of the mom&#39;s of one of her classmates. Hadn&#39;t seen <br/>\nher in awhile and she was aghast at my obvious state. Looked at me in horror <br/>\nand very serioulsy asked me if I was nuts having another kid. How she just <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t imagine having more than one. I was horrified that she would <br/>\nactually verbalize those thoughts, especially to my face. Needless to say, I <br/>\nwas pregnant with Sierra 4 months after Joseph was born and people really <br/>\nthought I had totally lost it. This was coming from friends and family at <br/>\nthe time. I had lost a baby after Sierra was born and even my in laws just <br/>\ndubbed me fertile mrytle and told me not to worry about the loss. Nice <br/>\nfamily huh??<br/>\n<br/>\nI was so happy when I found my homeschool support group here. Just wonderful <br/>\nloving thoughts for the kids and families. And when I was having Alyssa at <br/>\nthe age of 42, my hs group was so supportive and embraced the birth with us <br/>\nall. Encouraged me so much and don&#39;t even look at me with a blink of an eye <br/>\nwhen I express my thoughts of wanting another baby. What a difference it <br/>\nmade for me. I still have people look at me with shock when they see the 4 <br/>\nlittle gold kids hanging around my neck.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I drop my kids off once a week for a few hours of homeschool sports <br/>\ncamp and see the moms with 5, 6 and 7 kids and just smile with a bit of <br/>\nenvy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45487,"nextTopicId":32898}}
