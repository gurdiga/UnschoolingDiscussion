My 7yr old and 3 ½ year old sometimes get in territorial<br/>\nfights or seek my attention when it is directed elsewhere (phone, speaking<br/>\nwith another adult).  Weve recently split them up so that now  they have<br/>\ntheir own bedrooms (our den and office space were sacrificed) because the 3<br/>\nyr. old only sleeps 5 hours a night and keeps the older one awake,<br/>\nconstantly wanting the other to play with him.  So the torment goes both<br/>\nways. The fights have diminished slightly, but still, I also feel that my<br/>\napproach needs to be retooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older son is very emphatic towards animals : less so with his little<br/>\nbrother (unless he is physically hurt, falls down, etc then he rushes in<br/>\nwith band-aids and ice), situational empathy  I dont think he gets that<br/>\nyet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRebeca Z.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want a tender, gentle suggestion, sit with him and ask if he<br/>\nremembers any times when someone said something mean to him when he was<br/>\nlittle or called him a name he still remembers.
