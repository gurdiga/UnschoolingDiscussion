I feel <br/>\nso much empathy toward you.  When I read your first posts, I thought too that <br/>\nyou need to relax and let nature take it&#39;s course, all children develop at <br/>\ntheir own rate.  This last post, however, jumps out at me.  Now I&#39;m beginning <br/>\nto think that you may want to consider taking some action.  Have you had your <br/>\ndaughter tested by a psychologist or an occupational therapist trained to <br/>\nrecognize developmental delays?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son was slow to develop, too, and his preschool teacher suggested that he <br/>\nhad ADHD.  We had an extensive evaluation done by a child psychologist, and <br/>\nshe told us that his problem is not ADHD, but sensory integration <br/>\ndysfunction.  It is considered an autistic spectrum disorder, but not as <br/>\nsevere.  In effect, he doesn&#39;t process sensory stimuli the same way &quot;normal&quot; <br/>\npeople do, and it has resulted in delays in gross and fine motor development. <br/>\n But, intellectually he is not affected.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the diagnosis, we had an additional evaluation done by an occupational <br/>\ntherapist, who confirmed the diagnosis.  He was in occupational therapy for <br/>\nabout two years, and is still in group therapy with other boys his age to <br/>\ndevelop better social skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany SI children also often have speech delays which benefit from speech <br/>\ntherapy.  The acting out often comes from frustration over the inability to <br/>\ncontrol the body or communicate effectively.  These are all things that can <br/>\nbe successfully addressed in therapy.  Our insurance company (we&#39;re on an <br/>\nHMO) recommended the psychologist (who we learned even later has an excellent <br/>\nreputation).  Then our school system recommended the occupational therapy <br/>\nagency who did the second evaluation and the therapy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne important thing I learned from this process is that the earlier the <br/>\nintervention, the better.  OT for these children is designed to help the <br/>\nbrain reroute signals and reprocess them in the brain.  The brain, however, <br/>\nbecomes hard-wired about age 10, and it becomes progressively more difficult <br/>\nto retrain the sensory areas of the brain after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, our son is doing very well.  He&#39;s reached the therapy goals we <br/>\nset when he was four.  He&#39;s still uncoordinated, and doesn&#39;t have a lot of <br/>\nphysical confidence.  But he addresses all of these issues in his own way.  <br/>\nHe won&#39;t play team sports (his choice), but he takes karate and just started <br/>\ntaking ice skating lessons (at his own suggestion)!  He looks a bit ungainly <br/>\non the ice, and progress is a bit slow, but he loves it!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe decided to homeschool because he could not function in a classroom.  It <br/>\nwas the best decision we ever made.  Now, of course, we homeschool for <br/>\ncompletely different reasons -- because it&#39;s the best thing we can do for our <br/>\nchildren.    <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;d like to talk about this some more, feel free to post or to e-mail me <br/>\noff-list.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCarron</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Cathie _","from":"&quot;Cathie _&quot; &lt;cathie_98@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"2HHaIL7DnJHaVjKkf_iWaKiIGpSBSMsTaftqu5hSv9VFGYqdC8DXRiLKFQoDPVHA4id4BStmDXHvutjh2e2jwX0qTVzhTDmflA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] My 4 year old","postDate":"966544704","msgId":12045,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYyMjlDMXNaVjRDbGxQRjZwMFYwMDAwMzgwOEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12044,"nextInTopic":12063,"prevInTime":12044,"nextInTime":12046,"topicId":12008,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kandace, I know very little about autism, but I read an article about it yesterday in Good Housekeeping magazine-I don t know what issue it was, but from what","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1225619853\">Kandace, I know very little about autism, but I read an article about it <br/>\nyesterday in Good Housekeeping magazine-I don&#39;t know what issue it was, but <br/>\nfrom what I read there are treatments that are effective for autistic <br/>\nchildren now, but early intervention is crucial.

My <br/>\ndaughter was adopted from Russia at 22 months and was unable to speak even <br/>\nvery simple words until about 3.  At 4 she began to use more words, but <br/>\nthey were still unintelligible to most people outside our family.   She has <br/>\nhad a lot of speech therapy  (as well as occupational therapy and physical <br/>\ntherapy), and she now, at 5-1/2, is speaking in 3-4 word sentences, though <br/>\nshe is still difficult to understand.  She has many emotional and social <br/>\nissues that make it a challenge for her to interact with other kids, <br/>\nincluding my two younger kids (2 & 3).  She has many screaming fits, and <br/>\nthere is often major frustration for her in trying to make us understand <br/>\nher needs.  She also unreasonably wants what the other kids have much of <br/>\nthe time, and she can often be quite aggressive with them.  This is not to <br/>\nsay that she can&#39;t be a wonderful kid.  She definitely can be and is.  She <br/>\ndefinitely has her own set of challenges, however, challenges that we don&#39;t <br/>\nalways know how to handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is important to realize, however, is that there are MANY resources <br/>\navailable for kids with these kinds of challenges.  You can contact your <br/>\nlocal area education agency, and they will provide free evaluations of your <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s needs.  We have chosen to have Sheridan attend a special needs <br/>\npreschool that is located at the local public school, although we are <br/>\nhomeschooling the younger two kids.  Even if she did not attend this <br/>\nschool, however, Sheridan would be eligible for speech therapy, <br/>\noccupational therapy, and physical therapy (and now, starting this fall, <br/>\nmusic therapy, which we are THRILLED about because she responds incredibly <br/>\nwell to music) paid for by the local school district.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kim, who hasn&#39;t officially introduced herself yet but who has been lurking <br/>\nabout for the last few weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 07:58 PM 8/16/00 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Kandice, have you visited our message boards yet?

I have heard that this usually occurs at about 3<br/>\n&gt; years.<br/>\n&gt; Since that time, she has gone from being our very sweet loving baby to being<br/>\n&gt; very difficult for anyone in the family to live with.

I just don&#39;t know if everything is okay with her or not.  If<br/>\n&gt; more time and freedom to do her own thing is all she needs, that would be<br/>\n&gt; great.  She is free to have it here.

I decided on a whim to go to an ENT DR. I found out he \ncould not hear. He had fluid build up behind his ears(not due to ear infections) \nand his adnoide were 80% enlarged.

I would have her checked for allergies right away!!  In the meantime, until you can get in to see an allergist, start an elimination diet beginning with all the major suspicious items (dairy, wheat, etc) and remember that it may take weeks for effects to leave here system, so be patient.  Stick to whole foods, raw fruits and veggies (as long as she is not allergic to them) and get educated about allerges if you are not already.  Look for behavior changes after mealtime, or addict type behavior in demanding certain foods also.  Pay attention to self limiting in her diet and whether she obsesses over certain foods.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we have a highly allergic family, and also one acutely allergic child, I have been learning a lot about allergies in the past few years.  It sure sounds to me like this &quot;changed&quot; little girl is profoundly unhappy and suffering in some way.  If allergies prove not to be the problem (which would surprise me) I would look into chemical brain imbalances and whether she needs help to regulate that and allow her to function normally.  She may be depressed.  I was at that age, and I was NOT a pleasant child, let me tell you.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12060,"nextTopicId":12064}}
