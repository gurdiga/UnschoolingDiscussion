I am so glad I found my way to<br/>\nJohn Holt. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a big day of video watching, Jade decided to do<br/>\nsome work with playdo.  She had made some playdo food<br/>\nthen she wanted to write a menu. So she asked me how<br/>\nto spell a few words.  I spelled them out and she<br/>\nwrote the words herself like it was the most natural<br/>\nthing in the world. Its amazing to watch the learning<br/>\nunfold.  She is learning how to write and read just<br/>\nlike she has learned to walk, talk, ride a bike, and<br/>\ntie her shoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking forward to learning from y&#39;all.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nSamantha<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Loose your mind and come to your senses&quot; Tim Leary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
