However, it freezes differently, also.  The ice that results <br/>\nin an ordinary ice tray in the freezer when cold water is frozen is &quot;normal&quot; <br/>\nice, safe to put into your ice tea or Pepsi Cola.  the ice frozen from very <br/>\nhot water, while freezing faster, is not always so safe.  it has a tendency <br/>\nto explode rather violently when put into anything warm or hot, like freshly <br/>\nmade hot tea that is being iced or Pepsi that has been sitting in a closet <br/>\nrather than the refrigerator.  And if put into cold liquid, such as Pepsi <br/>\nthat cames from the refrigerator, it has a tendency to &quot;slush up&quot; more than <br/>\nice made with cold water.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, while I don&#39;t really understand the reasons for hot water <br/>\nfreezing faster, it isn&#39;t practical to freeze hot water into ice to be used <br/>\nfor drinking purposes unless you like exploding ice.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTry it ...
