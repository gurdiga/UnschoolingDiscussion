But for many reasons<br/>\nsome babies do not thrive on breast milk.  They may be<br/>\n(as my son was) lactose intolerant *and* allergic to<br/>\nmilk.  Their mother may be eating something to which<br/>\nthey are allergic.  They may be severely hypoglycemic<br/>\n(again, as my son was) and the milk simply doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhave enough sugars in it to keep them alive.  They may<br/>\nbe too weak to suck.  Their mothers may be unable, due<br/>\nto stress, nutritional problems etc, to provide<br/>\nsufficient breastmilk.  They may need a different<br/>\nbalance of nutrients for a variety of health reasons<br/>\nthan breast milk can provide.  They may be too<br/>\nunderdeveloped to process breastmilk.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe majority of babies in the NICU my son was in could<br/>\nnot use breastmilk for one reason or another.  And<br/>\nmost babies will refuse the breast once they are<br/>\ninitiated on a bottle... the bottle provides faster<br/>\nservice with less work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne may accurately say that the female human body was<br/>\ndesigned to breastfeed, and that biologically and<br/>\notherwise *most* babies benefit from breast feeding. <br/>\nBut it is a sweeping generality to say that *all*<br/>\nchildren benefit from breast feeding in infancy.  Some<br/>\nbabies would die or fail to thrive from breast<br/>\nfeeding, so it is not factually the case that all<br/>\nchildren benefit from breast feeding in infancy.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeed a lift back onto the soapbox?<br/>\n<br/>\nEileen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- DiamondAir &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:diamondair@...\">diamondair@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Eileen M.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ravensegg@...\">ravensegg@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The same type of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sweeping generality, for instance, would be that<br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children benefit from breast feeding in their<br/>\n&gt; infancy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ummmm, sorry but I don&#39;t understand why this<br/>\n&gt; &quot;generality&quot; would be a<br/>\n&gt; problem.
