I wasn&#39;t expecting that, just giving my view to get it off my chest so someone other than my husband (and my dad) could hear it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, I would be honored if you were to use my quote, and no, my mother doesn&#39;t even have a computer so I am happy to have you quote me.  I actually met you at Good Vibrations and bought your Big Book of Unschooling (which I loved), however I didn&#39;t introduce myself! (I heard your kids speak too which just made me more sure of the path I was heading down...oh, and the coolest thing, Holly took a picture of my family at the beach day...we were so excited when we saw that because we had not brought our camera.) <br/>\n<br/>\nI discovered unschooling in April of 2008, the day before my eldest sons 3rd B-Day.  So, I have been working very much towards this path since then. I have read so many books, we have been to three conferences (soon to be four), which I find at this point to be very helpful, fun, and nurturing. <br/>\n<br/>\n I came to realization that my mom would never accept me for who I was (just who I should be) a long time ago, although it didn&#39;t stop me back then from trying to please her...go figure that out!!!  There are also many &quot;ghosts&quot; that I know she fights all time, so I just accept her for the way she is, and share with her how I perceive things to be.  Some people are more open to change than others. I wish to make peace with myself in order to move forward, and that is me.  She is only willing to look backwards and find the negative in everything.  She may change though, and I am always hopeful, but I don&#39;t sit around waiting for it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSelena, I hope everything goes better for you.  That made me very sad reading your post.

A little","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-874322155\">Hello everyone...I am new to the group (joined about 2 minutes ago), but I felt the need to address this question since it is very close to home. A little background<br/>\n<br/>\n          My mother is a professional pianist/accompanist/teacher.  She worked with Jascha Heifetz, Leila Josefowicz, Dylana Jenson (etc.). When I was born she was determined that I would become the next great violinist and I started when I was 2 ½ . I was miserable to say the least.  One day when I was about seven I found a tape recording of myself at age 3.  My mom was pregnant with my brother and was asking me whether I wanted a brother or sister to which I answered I wanted a cello.  My mom dismissed the answer and went on talking.  Well, my grandmother heard the recording and suggested she switch me to cello.  At eight I began lessons and excelled quickly.  (Yes, musical family 4th generation.)  Thing is, I also liked ballet, gymnastics, ice skating and sports.  My mom though asked each of my coaches whether I had any potential to develop a career out of them.  The answer was no.  All of my lessons, except for cello stopped.  I was made to practice every day, and threatened with many things if I did not.  I began to resent the cello.<br/>\n<br/>\nside note.  I have always loved working with children, always was the &quot;game leader&quot;, and involved with peer counseling and other things at school<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I graduated High School I was sent (literally the next day) to a Training Camp to &quot; learn how to teach. &quot;  I started teaching that August and within two years had a studio of about 20 pupils.  So here is the catch I love teaching. I mean really love it.  There is nothing I enjoy more than going out to work with children (and adults) of all ages and levels.  I have so much fun my work seems more like play to me.  (I have been teaching 21 years now).  But when it comes to the actual cello part, well, I could switch it to something else (if I knew something else as well).  My whole life was set up to do what I do now.  (Although I am constantly reminded by my mom what a great performer I could have beenhaven&#39;t performed since the kids were born.)  I don&#39;t go out of my way to hear concerts, or listen to cello music but I have numerous students at conservatories around the country though that do have this passion.  I do still love the cello, and the little three year old in me who asked for it is still there, but there is also so much baggage and memories that are painful.  Because of this I know I teach differently than the teacher who finds the cello (or any instrument) to be the most important thing in life.  I have always strived to make lessons enjoyable for my students, and for them to want to learn cello.  (I think even more so since I have started down this path). And yes, I have had many students whos parents have forced them to play (and practice), but none of them have wanted to stop lessons because they enjoy coming.  And you know what? They do learn.  They may not learn as much as the students that practice daily, but many of them have a love for the cello the others who are forced to do not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your child is enjoying the lessons, continue them.  If the lessons are not enjoyable, stop.  Not everyone needs to learn how to play an instrument, or how to play it &quot;correctly&quot;.  Let him or her come to it because it is something they have a passion for, and want to do. Then it will be something they will carry with them for the rest of their life with good feelings associated with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, that was the other thing I was going to say.  When I turned 20 I started skating again, sometimes as much as 4 hours a day.  I loved it, the smell of the ice, the cold, the feeling of the blades against the ice.  For 8 years I followed this passion, and my mom protested the whole time about me breaking something and not being able to teach.  I didn&#39;t listen.  Then I got to the point where I just really couldn&#39;t go any further, mostly my own fear at that point. (I think!) I then started scrapbooking (&quot;waste of time my mom said, you should practice&quot; OMG I was 28!), and then when the kids were born doing home movies (&quot;horrible rock music, can&#39;t watch it&quot; was the response I got), and now for the last few years it has been gardening and raising our chickens. My mom, although she loves me and my husband and kids very much still thinks I have not reached my true potential.  I agree with her in that one, except for her it is about, always has been, and will be, about the music, and for me it is about my family and parenting in a much different way than I was raised.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Music Lessons","postDate":"1279802605","msgId":113424,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE0NERBRTNFLTEzQTctNEJCMS1BQjEwLTUzRjkxNThCNTE1M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJFRTQ1MDFDLTlCMDItNDJERC05MjgyLUM0N0QyREVCN0E2N0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDdlZjIzLjQ2MzMzYWUyLjM5NzhkYmJhQGFvbC5jb20+IDxCRUU0NTAxQy05QjAyLTQyREQtOTI4Mi1DNDdEMkRFQjdBNjdAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":113423,"nextInTopic":113425,"prevInTime":113423,"nextInTime":113425,"topicId":91095,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-MANY people would come over for two or three hours for $25, -=- Wait, wait.... for $25 you could get one person.

Seems <br/>\nhard to swallow but the truth is it&#39;s even worse to continue to pay for  <br/>\nsomething they&#39;ve lost interest in.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy sister in law (whom I&#39;ve known since we were 13 and not even thinking of <br/>\n being related, plays piano by ear, she taught herself.  When it was <br/>\npointed  out to her parents that she might even be GREAT if she had lessons, they <br/>\ngot her  some.  She didn&#39;t want them.  She was too advanced on her own for  <br/>\nweekly piano lessons with a classically trained teacher who was appalled at <br/>\nher  lack of &quot;correct form&quot;.  She could play any song she heard and play  <br/>\nwell.  While she was taking lessons she learned to HATE to play for  practice <br/>\nor for anything remotely close to the lessons.<br/>\n <br/>\nThey finally figured out their money would be better spent on other  <br/>\nthings.  Surely, over time, she began to enjoy playing again, without  lessons.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m not saying everyone that WANTS to play an instrument will figure it out <br/>\n on their own, I supposed there is some degree of natural talent or an ear <br/>\nfor  music that doesn&#39;t exist in everyone, but it certainly speaks to <br/>\nmotivation and  the LOVE of the music and playing it.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m thinking the answer is to just talk the child and ask them if they  <br/>\nreally want to continue with the lessons, maybe they&#39;re just don&#39;t want to do  <br/>\nlessons right now, maybe they&#39;ll want to do it at another time.  Maybe at  <br/>\nanother time the lesson money won&#39;t even be so hard to come up with.  If  <br/>\nthey still want lessons maybe they have to figure out how to do what the music  <br/>\nteacher requires for each class without feeling forced but see it as a <br/>\ncontinuum  of the lessons that they DO want. <br/>\n <br/>\nI know it&#39;s sometimes hard to reconcile that we GAVE them what they want  <br/>\nbut now they don&#39;t WANT it.

She never stopped playing.  Her parents gave her music lessons <br/>\nwhich she took for a while and got what she needed and then stopped taking them. <br/>\n She still plays the piano.  She plays all the time, she loves it.  It isn&#39;t <br/>\npractice, it&#39;s real playing, the same as when she first started doing when she <br/>\nwas about 6 or 7.<br/>\n<br/>\nPracticing a musical instrument has some merit, but ultimately it&#39;s not playing <br/>\na musical instrument, it&#39;s practicing, doing drills and such.  That can be fun, <br/>\nbut only if the person likes doing those sorts of drills.  I took violin lessons <br/>\nfor many years.  I liked doing those drills, but mostly because I pretty much <br/>\nsuck at actually playing the violin.  I could be good at all those exercises and <br/>\nplaying the various songs that I practiced, but that never expanded beyond.  I <br/>\nnever played just because I loved to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like housework, don&#39;t make it something to hate or dread.  Don&#39;t force it, <br/>\ndon&#39;t coerce it.  If you want to do housework, then do housework, if you want to <br/>\nplay music, then play music.  Do it because you enjoy it, not because you have <br/>\nto.  What is the point otherwise?  Is there some goal at the end, a prize to be <br/>\nwon?  That&#39;s the kind of thinking school does to us, do this ____ and attain <br/>\n_____.  It&#39;s very goal oriented.
