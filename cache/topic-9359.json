My father wanted to name me Jessica Catherine and as far as he knew <br/>\nthats what my name would be.  Well my Mother was mad at my father for <br/>\ngetting her pregnant as she didn&#39;t want me in the first place so she decided<br/>\n<br/>\nat the last minute to name me Bridget (because my father didn&#39;t like the <br/>\nname) and  Mary (because she was supposedly Catholic at the time) Apparently<br/>\n<br/>\nshe also thought that having the initials B.M. or B.S. (my maiden name is <br/>\nSchwaderer) would be a cute way of getting back at my father too.  After <br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t want my name anymore so I changed it to Holly because I liked <br/>\nit and my friends said that the name Holly suited me better anyway.   <br/>\nHowever, now that I go by Holly I kind of feel like a fake using that name <br/>\nsometimes and wonder If I overreacted to my biological mothers hurtful <br/>\ncomments by changing my name.   Either way, thats how I came to be called <br/>\nHolly. =)  I didn&#39;t mean for it to be such a long story =)<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bctswim@...\">bctswim@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Meeting new people..Fill in the <br/>\n&gt;blanks...Please.<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 15 Jun 2000 00:11:14 EDT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;holly,<br/>\n&gt;how did you end up as holly?<br/>\n&gt;bridget<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt;Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To Unsubscribe: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFind long lost high school friends:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/5535/7/_/448294/_/961174343/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/5535/7/_/448294/_/961174343/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\nCheck it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo Unsubscribe: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9334,"nextTopicId":9364}}
