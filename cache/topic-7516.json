Believe me, after trying for 7 years to get pregnant, I know <br/>\nthat homeopathy will not cure everything.  But I was hoping to say that <br/>\nsymptoms can be relieved or even eliminated.  Even doctors of homeopathy <br/>\nrecognize that some illness can also be hereditary.  This may mean that they <br/>\nare very deep rooted and may take a long time to heal.  I believe this may be <br/>\nthe cause of my infertility.  But I also know that my daughter had migraine <br/>\nheadaches  3 times a week as a small child and she was allergic to many <br/>\ndifferent foods which would then bring on migraines, and thru homeopathy she <br/>\nis now headache and allergy free.  I would never push anything on anyone - I <br/>\njust want to share what has helped me and my family.  If I have offended or <br/>\nhurt anyone, please accept my apologies and know that my intentions are pure. <br/>\n Good Luck to you!     jackie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7515,"nextTopicId":7514}}
