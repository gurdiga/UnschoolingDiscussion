She only writes at christmas <br/>\nand keeps me up with what her children (all grown now) are doing.    <br/>\nThey all went to ps and all have qualificatins and degrees and have <br/>\nwon scholarships to study in America and taught english in French <br/>\nschools.  These children are the same age as my older children.  I am <br/>\nvery proud of my childrens attainments - none did well at school - <br/>\nbut all have succedded in life.  So why does this friend make me feel <br/>\nas though her children are better than mine - Oh! she doesnt do it <br/>\nintentionally.<br/>\nI feel the same way about h/s ing.   We do hear so much about how <br/>\nsucceful h/s ers are, that we expect miracles from our own children - <br/>\nacedemically miracles.  When my dd has no interest in anything much <br/>\nat all, I wonder why...... why isnt she like all these other h/s <br/>\nchildren who greed for knowledge......<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved grandma on the computer!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nmarianne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14973,"nextTopicId":14907}}
