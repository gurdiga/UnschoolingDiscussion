Hope <br/>\nyour summers are going okay. We had a B-Day party for DD on Sunday. She just <br/>\nturned 9. She had a great time, but  I often wonder if its wise to put7/8 <br/>\ngirls in one spot(we are so catty sometimes!) One of the girls has asthma(sp) <br/>\nand smoke from campfires bothers her as does childrens play makeup anything <br/>\nperfumey. Anyway the other kids were doing sparklers as did she but my dad <br/>\nlit off the canon and that bothered her a bit. So she used her in-haler and <br/>\ncame and sat with me for a while. Not all of these girls  knew eachother most <br/>\nof them are cousins but two of the girls who came are from my dd&#39;s first <br/>\nschool (she went 1st and 2cd0 The girl with asthma  and one of her other <br/>\nfriends. So they were calling her a snob. I felt so bad for her. I really <br/>\nsnapped and yelled at them all if they didnt learn to get along then everyone <br/>\nwas going home! (no Mary Poppins here!! EG) They were just so &quot;Clicky&quot; And I <br/>\nreally felt *Weird* because Im pretty close to that little girl she spends <br/>\nalot of time at my house even though we moved two towns away. But some of the <br/>\n*other* girls are my nieces. (&#39;That I love dearly) I did not like the feeling <br/>\nthat I had for the rest of the day. BTW my dad did not know she couldnt be <br/>\naround the smoke otherwise he would have never lit off the canon.  She is <br/>\nbeginnig to grow out of it though , thats really good. Anyway sorry if my <br/>\nthoughts are not all in one place tonight  like I said SCATTERBRAINS!! I just <br/>\nfeel  funny lately like Im disorganized or something. But when I look around <br/>\neverything seems fine. I dont know sorry for babbleling and thanks for <br/>\nlistening. <br/>\nIf anything came out of the party its DD had a great time and I remembered <br/>\none of the reasons for homeschooling. She was the only one and it showed. BG<br/>\n<br/>\nTamie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10969,"nextTopicId":10972}}
