Children need to be left<br/>\n&gt; &gt; alone as well. They need to use their own abilities to entertain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; themselves.  Distractions and entertainment come in many forms. While<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a mother who keeps her kids busy with activity is using a more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sensory approach then TV or video games it is ultimately steering<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children in the mothers chosen direction.  I am definitely not saying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that you should sit around the house all day but I also don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that running all over the place trying to keep kids &quot;busy&quot; is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; answer.  There are a LOT of homeschooling/unschooling moms who do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this and I just don&#39;t agree...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tara, I completely agree with you (and I&#39;ll wager most unschoolers here<br/>\ndo,<br/>\n&gt; too).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My posts on activities may have been confusing -- I was trying to get<br/>\nacross<br/>\n&gt; that if there is consistently nothing more interesting than TV (and TV is<br/>\n&gt; pretty interesting to most humans) that that is what a child will do. I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t mean for everyone to be constantly on the move. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Boredom is, IMHO, a vital part of unschooling. From boredom comes the<br/>\n&gt; motivation to do amazing things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
