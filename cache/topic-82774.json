Western <br/>\nMass. was a great place to live.   My stepfather is living there now and <br/>\nmoved there from Cambridge to get away from the things you seem to want to <br/>\nleave.  There are a lot of small and larger, village-y like towns and five <br/>\nmajor colleges (Amherst, Smith, Hampshire, UMass and My. Holyoke).  I lived <br/>\nin both Northampton and in Amherst and there is a large college pop. but <br/>\nthe locals have a firm standing.  Unless it&#39;s changed a lot, you don&#39;t feel <br/>\noverrun by the college pop.   I gave my step-father a book named _Home <br/>\nTown_ by Tracy Kidder, that is about Northampton.   Reading it convinced my <br/>\nstep-father&#39;s wife (my mother is no longer alive) to check out the area.  I <br/>\nhave read it and don&#39;t know exactly what did this, but it is a good <br/>\nbook.  There are a lot of possibilities in that area and it is beautiful; <br/>\nmountains, valleys,  great swimming watering holes in hidden bits of the <br/>\nforests, a huge variety of culture and of people...  I would love to move <br/>\nback there.  I don&#39;t know about the local hschooling laws there though.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadeline<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cUnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">cUnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <br/>\n&gt;&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!

The town always<br/>\nhad many tourists when we visited a few times last year so I think such a shop could do ok.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH,<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Olga [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mccluskieo@...\">mccluskieo@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, October 11, 2003 10:44 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] sort of OT: great places to<br/>\nlive/homeschool<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question for everyone in the northeast and canada.  Me and <br/>\ndh have decided that we want to relocate.  Huge decsion for us!  <br/>\nRight now we are in the preliminary stages of getting the business <br/>\nready to sell, figuring out how his parents will survive or if they <br/>\nshould come with us and of course where our business would do well.  <br/>\nWe are considering the northeast (narrowed down to VA, MD, DE, CT, <br/>\nME, MA, PA, NH, VT and even considering PEI in Canada.  <br/>\n<br/>\n1: How are these states for homeschooling, obviously unschooling in <br/>\nterms of being relaxed?<br/>\n2. We really want to live a more relaxed, laid back lifestyle.  Any <br/>\nrecommendations on cities that have an appreciation for that instead <br/>\nof what car you drive? (we live in Boca Raton, FL now pretty much a <br/>\nplace of excess and we have had our fill)<br/>\n3. completely OT: We run a british grocery business and bakery.  We <br/>\nwould like to continue that and specialize in teas and such.  Anyone <br/>\nknow any places that are needing of such a thing or would appreciate <br/>\nartisan baking and the such.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny info would be appreciated since we don&#39;t kow much about the <br/>\nspecifics of those places.  THANK YOU!<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
