When kids are interested, then algebra <br/>\ncan be learned in a variety of different ways. I like the book, Algebra <br/>\nUnplugged, as a starting point - it is a math book for &quot;word people&quot; more <br/>\nthan any other, but even for us number-lovers it is a great introduction to <br/>\nall the main ideas of algebra. I&#39;d definitely read through that before <br/>\nstarting or along with starting any kind of more traditional algebra <br/>\nprogram that involves just mostly learning &quot;how to do&quot; algebra.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarold Jacobs algebra book is rigorous and good - perfect for pretty mature <br/>\npeople who enjoy delving into things, really investigating and thinking <br/>\nabout stuff. There is as much learning in the questions as in the content <br/>\nof the text.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Key to Algebra series is good for just plain old practice - it is &quot;how <br/>\nto do&quot; algebra, with almost no information about why you&#39;d ever want to do <br/>\nit or why it works. Not very interesting - but friendly practice stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think getting really good conceptual understanding BEFORE doing the &quot;how <br/>\nto do&quot; stuff is a good idea. You could get algebra puzzle stuff from <br/>\nCritical Thinking Press and algebra games from other sources.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally do not think doing a formal algebra program before the age of <br/>\n14 or 15 or even later is a good idea unless the kid is SO self-motivated <br/>\nthat he just does it himself and clearly loves it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might fool with Calculus by and for Kids as an alternative -- there is <br/>\nalso Calculus for Cats by the same author as Algebra Unplugged.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - he could fool with Astro Algebra -- the computer game in the Mighty <br/>\nMath series - not a rigorous algebra course, but excellent for developing <br/>\nconceptual understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49157,"nextTopicId":49171}}
