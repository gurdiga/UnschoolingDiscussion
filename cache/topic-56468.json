He spent the <br/>\nnight at his new friends&#39; house last night, an exciting place with all this <br/>\nstuff that they have that he doesn&#39;t have.  Yet, when invited to stay a <br/>\nsecond night, he wanted to come home.  The reason why is that he likes <br/>\nbeing home.  He loves visiting friends, and he loves being home.  And he <br/>\nknows himself enough to be where he wants to be.  He knows that when an <br/>\ninvitation comes up for him, he&#39;s not going to get interference from his <br/>\nfolks.

Late by minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s  never so much as taken a soda to pay for it later.
