Like your next<br/>\ndoor neightbor, someone you interact with on a regular basis, someone whose<br/>\nchildren you witness interacting without the &quot;company is coming&quot; faces put<br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many unschooling families do you know who have adult children?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know many over a period of 40 years.

I also know families that have seen many &quot;bumps&quot; in the<br/>\nroad.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I have never seen an &quot;unschooler&quot; discouraged or run off by what<br/>\nother folks say.  I&#39;ve seen them discouraged but go looking in another<br/>\ndirection.  If someone is so easily dissuaded by chitchat on the net, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think they are going to get there anyway.  Unschooling is not exactly<br/>\nthe easy road.  It takes effort to set aside a whole life time of<br/>\nprogramming.  It takes, to put it bluntly, starry eyed idealists who go<br/>\nmerrily on their way listening to no one but that inner voice that says &quot;I<br/>\nknow I can, I know I can&quot; or just plain stubborn folks who KNOW that there<br/>\nis a different way and come h*ll or high water they are going to find &quot;it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think that all the continual harping on one person is more<br/>\nlikely to run off the &quot;newbie&quot; than the minor sharing of the learning style<br/>\nof one child.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be wise for folks to remember the unschooling is NOT some<br/>\n&quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; garment.

I simply got rid of cable, and since we don&#39;t get reception where we live, except for PBS, that limited TV viewing somewhat. The other part was that I had to be assertive and tell them not to pop movies in to watch whenever they want. I let them watch an hour or 2 (if they get up early enough) in the morning, then it goes off.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 3 year old has it the worst. She whines for it and is more clingy when it&#39;s not on.

We&#39;ve told her since she was around 2 1/2 that pottying is best done in the potty, but we still allowed her to wear diapers.  A couple of weeks ago, she asked to wear panties and has not had an accident since. She still wears a diaper to bed, but she does not yet wake up dry.  It was her decision to potty train not ours. My 6 year old did the same thing on her 3rd b-day. We bought her Scooby panties as a gift, and from then on she was potty trained.  It&#39;s a heck of a-lot easier than spanking and humiliation, which I&#39;m sure none of us do.<br/>\nNew to the list but not to home-schooling,<br/>\nJosefa<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blali@...\">blali@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So Karin,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a 3 1/2 yr old and an 11 month old. TV seems to be an issue in my house. If I let Shawn watch all he wants and whatever he wants I find that his behavior deteriorates...so do you find that some things need to be controlled until a certain maturity occurs? or am I being too concerned over it?  I fully intend and consider myself unschooling. I don&#39;t expect Shawn to DO anything other than behave like any normal 3 yr old...and sometimes he truly surprises me and I think I have a 5 yr old in the house! He is very articulate and loves documentaries and movies about mummies. We&#39;ve had a number of conversations-which he initiated-on why people die and what happens etc, etc. He loves watching Nik jr and Disney and Noggin....and at night he always wants to watch Junkyard Wars on TLC  and of course on the weekend he cant get enough of Monster Jam on TNN :)  My boy loves monster trucks...well actually all form of motor vehicles. And my 11 month old girl seems to also enjoy playing cars<br/>\n&gt; and says vrrooom quite clearly.  She also kisses all the stuffed animals and dolls in the house...of her own initiative:)  I am continually amazed at the difference between them that seems to be solely due to gender differences as I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t parent her much differently than I did him at the same age. Have any of you come across this in your family???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This was  a lot longer than I intended...guess I&#39;m no longer lurking:)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Beth- busy mommy to Shawn and Shannon, my precious angels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; oh...today we started intense potty training....I think I&#39;m not using the unschooling method here because I initiated it, but Shawn had NO accidents today and went to bathroom to pee a number of times without telling me! So I&#39;m pretty sure my gut instincts were right and he is ready, but was holding out for the attention due to little sister. What is your experience with this?<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Karin<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Monday, March 11, 2002 5:17 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] question<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hi Vivian,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Completely off topic, but have you read The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood? One of the main characters is named Vivian (Vivi for short) and seeing your name reminded me of that book. If you haven&#39;t read it, consider it! I really enjoyed it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Anyway, just thought I&#39;d share how we are unschooling in our family.<br/>\n&gt;   I have 2 boys, 9 & 10 (soon to be 11) and we&#39;ve been unschooling since September. I homeschooled them for 5 years previously.<br/>\n&gt;   Since we started, we have changed almost every aspect of our lives. Unschooling applies to EVERYTHING around here. After learning as much as I could about unschooling and how it works best, I figured if I wanted unschooling to work like it was supposed to, I needed to go &quot;all the way&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Since unschooling I have dropped any and all expectations required of my boys. The only thing I expect from them is to treat others and themselves respectfully and not to hurt each other.<br/>\n&gt;   So, that means that I don&#39;t make them do any schoolwork anymore, like math, spelling, grammar, science, history, etc...<br/>\n&gt;   They have unlimited tv viewing access all day long. I have removed the rules of when they can or can&#39;t watch tv and how long.<br/>\n&gt;   They have unlimited computer and/or gameboy playing time all day long, as long as they want.<br/>\n&gt;   I used to require that they do chores around the house, but I stopped that too. They even had to take turn&#39;s doing dishes every night, but that too is stopped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   What have all these changes done to our household? Brought chaos and confusion and spoiled kids you might wonder?<br/>\n&gt;   No, in fact, compared to before unschooling, we have much more peace and joy and most importantly, more love. I&#39;ve found that since I&#39;ve dropped all expectations of my boys, I no longer get dissapointed in them (for something they didn&#39;t complete or accomplish). They are simply allowed to &quot;be&quot;, to do whatever they want to do. I love them and appreciate them more now than every before. My whole perception of them has changed for the better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   About chores, I have a lot of prior experiences with all different chore systems. It always ended up the same - me nagging at them to do their chores (even if they were getting paid for it) and me and them feeling terrible.<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;ve gone back to doing all the sweeping, vacuuming, laundry, bathroom cleaning, cooking, etc. all by myself. But you know what I found out? That when I don&#39;t require them to do chores, after a while they will spontaneously do odd cleaning jobs around the house without me telling them to do so. They really do have their own desire to help out around the house, but don&#39;t appreciate being told to do so. Imagine how you would feel if your dh TOLD you it was time to clean the toilet, wash the windows, vacuum the floors, etc. I don&#39;t know about you, but I would get pretty upset! So that&#39;s why I felt it was best to change the way we handled chores around here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Now, I&#39;m not telling ANYBODY to change their lives and live the way that we do. That would be CRAZY! :-) But I am so happy since unschooling and it has fit our family like a glove. Sorry this turned out to be so long, but I got on a roll! Just sharing.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Karin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   vivrh wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I dont have any specific questions. I just would like everyone to comment on how they feel their children stay motivated. I have only been &quot;un&quot; schooling since December but I have been home schooling since October 2000.<br/>\n&gt;   With our &quot;unschooling&quot; now, I dont require them to do anything but occasionally write in their journals. I also read to them daily and they have a daily quiet time. But I guess what I am asking is what are your days like? And while I have seen some progress, I worry a little about wether or not they will progress overall.<br/>\n&gt;   God bless<br/>\n&gt;   Vivian<br/>\n&gt;   Mom to three Happy little Monkeys<br/>\n&gt;   Austin 10/31/93 Sarah 8/28/95 Emmalee 8/15/00<br/>\n&gt;   And loving wife to Randy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   **If fifty million people say a foolish thing, it is still a foolish thing.<br/>\n&gt;   -Anatole France***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!
