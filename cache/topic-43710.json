Let HIM finish the stories<br/>\nsometimes - and don&#39;t cringe if he finishes them violently on occasion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis suggestion reminded me of an event yesterday. Ds, 5.5 is easily and<br/>\nfrequently frustrated. He explodes into raging fits and tearful breakdowns.<br/>\nYesterday he was hammering a planter box together and really wanted to start<br/>\nthe nails in himself. He got one in and then tried another. He started<br/>\nhammering into a knot in the wood and his nail bent 3 times. He has a full<br/>\nsize hammer in his hand. He starts pounding with it, crying and I attempt to<br/>\ntake possesion of the hammer. I asked him once I had secured the tool, what<br/>\nhis solution was for the bending nail problem. He screamed kill you with the<br/>\nhammer. I said I would be all gone and would miss being with him. He crumbled<br/>\ninto a teary heap and then asked if I would start the nail for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, after he finished the planter he told me he was just kidding, that he<br/>\nwas really mad the nail bent. He has now experienced the frustration of<br/>\nhammering into really dense wood.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43656,"nextTopicId":43582}}
