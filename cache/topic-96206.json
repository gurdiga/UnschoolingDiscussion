Every once in a while -- if she <br/>\nsees me lighting a candle -- she&#39;ll want to do a few, but (because she <br/>\nCAN) it&#39;s not so exciting any more.  :)<br/>\n-Tracy-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":102372243,"authorName":"deedeanne","from":"&quot;deedeanne&quot; &lt;deedeanne@...&gt;","profile":"deedeanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"playing with fire.....","postDate":"1089734808","msgId":96206,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNkMTFhbytpaWY1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":96210,"prevInTime":96205,"nextInTime":96207,"topicId":96206,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When I was around 8yo I was playing with matches and toothpicks, seeing how close they could get before igniting.

I was alone in our <br/>\nbasement/playroom because I was forbidden to play with matches. <br/>\nAfter blowing them out, I threw them away.  Of course, one wasn&#39;t <br/>\nfully out and started a fire in the trash can.  I ran straight for a <br/>\nbucket of water, put it out, and went upstairs after I stopped <br/>\nshaking enough and &quot;confessed&quot; to my parents. They had no idea, and <br/>\nwere quite shocked as I rarely disoebeyed, and that scary experiment <br/>\ngave even more weight to the &quot;Mom&#39;s always right. She has more <br/>\nexperience and knows what she&#39;s talking about.&quot; tape that played in <br/>\nmy head for too many years.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, my 12yo has been allowed to experiment with fire, legal <br/>\nfireworks, and such with our supervision from a younger age than I <br/>\nwas comfortable. DH was happy to participate and guide him in those <br/>\nendeavors! I was so amazed when DS and his friend figured out how to <br/>\nstart fires with magnifying glasses on a camping trip. I had never <br/>\nseen or done that as a child so I was just as excited as the kids! <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were at a local park, not long after that camping trip, a <br/>\nwoman came up to us and asked if we had any matches. She was with a <br/>\nbig group of people who had a whole picnic set up, but no one had <br/>\nmatches to start the grill. I said, &quot;No, sorry.&quot; Then I <br/>\nremembered, &quot;But we do have a magnifying glass.&quot;  She looked at me <br/>\nlike I had three heads and said, &quot;So?&quot; I pulled it out of my <br/>\nbackpack, gave it to my son and told him to go and help them start <br/>\ntheir fire. He and his friend went, and were back in a few minutes <br/>\nwith huge grins on their faces. That was one of my favorite <br/>\nunschooling/thinking outside the box moments.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I guess I just wanted to agree with everyone who is saying <br/>\nthat forbidding things from children obviously doesn&#39;t protect them <br/>\nfrom whatever it is. Information, experience appropriate to that <br/>\nchild&#39;s age, personality, tempermant is much better insurance in my <br/>\nmind.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeanne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96201,"nextTopicId":96211}}
