I was raised to believe that words are words and<br/>\nthat&#39;s it.  We attach meaning to them.  I don&#39;t appreciate name calling<br/>\nor hurtful talking in our house, but swear words (shit, fuck, damn,<br/>\netc...) even the kids say these.  We have discussions about appropriate<br/>\ntimes and places, but they know they are ok to use.  The result?  They<br/>\nrarely use them, but when they do it is definitely in context.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43654,"nextTopicId":43659}}
