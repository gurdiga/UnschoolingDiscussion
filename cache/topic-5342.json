Aside from some irritating songs about having no &quot;dessert&quot; until <br/>\nyou clean your plate and a little girl who never says please and is sent <br/>\noff into the woods ntil she can &quot;learn&quot; to say please, it was a neat video.  <br/>\nThere is a song about the wind.

Deaf people seem to have a special connection/link that<br/>\nspeaking and hearing people have &quot;lost&quot;.

Too intimate,<br/>\n<br/>\ni think because asl itself really &#39;demands&#39; that you not be self-conscious and<br/>\nreally be involved physically (body and face) with what you are expressing, that it<br/>\nruns contrary to every form of english language &#39;etiquette&#39;.  also because the deaf<br/>\nrely on what they see and use this to identify and describe it proves to be all to<br/>\nreal for many speaking people who prefer to ignore what is right in front of their<br/>\nface.<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. i&#39;m glad you like the website<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Thad Martin","from":"Thad Martin &lt;tmartin@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"zh9750tRQ5qF67oCbEs07lsdfzhlVmy-HZRLniZ4phWjm6zgSUWuT3bKiphvjENJGfcGmX2BRuFiGjkAvlDZN9yKLdDtpqbsqXk","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"structure/foreign lang/art","postDate":"945447847","msgId":5342,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNDMuNTM0Mi45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5344,"prevInTime":5341,"nextInTime":5343,"topicId":5342,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hi, my husband  and i are both artist as well.  he s a sculptor and works in clay, if you re interested you can see his work @ http://www.deafart.org/.

We went only twice.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Each week there was a different &quot;project&quot; - making a marionette or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;working with clay....There were many different materials - seemed neat...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I spoke to the &quot;teacher&quot; after she explained about the &quot;class&quot;.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;explained my point of view - that it was the creative *process* that is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;interesting and important. That I was seeking something free and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;*unstructured*.  I must have been dreaming.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I hung out reading a book.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The teacher took the black marker that Claire chose for her marionette,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;explained that it was dark and not good - and she began to show<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Claire how to do it - coloring almost all of the marionette as Claire<br/>\n&gt; &gt;watched.  I put my book down, and explained again to the teacher that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it is *Claire* who is creating something in her own way.  &quot;Where is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;problem with black&quot;, I asked?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;It&#39;s sad&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Really&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Yes&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;No. Claire does not see this black color as sad.  *You* see the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;black color as sad.  I like it.  Nice contrast&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I placed the black marker back within reach of Claire and said she<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was free to choose any color she wishes and that her Marionette is fine<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and beautiful.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I gently recapped my ideas.  The teacher said she thoroughly understood<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my point of view, but went on to stress the importance of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;finished product. She discussed that the *parents* were going to see<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the artwork.  She went on to tell me how much more &quot;free&quot; and &quot;open<br/>\n&gt; &gt;minded&quot; she was.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I felt as if I were talking to a tree trunk.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Anyway - I was told the following week that I could not stay - that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;no parents were permitted to stay.  Needless to say - I no longer<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wanted to stay.  Claire and I left - went to the park to breath some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fresh air.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The pottery class that we attended months before at the same place<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(Maison du Temps Libre - House of Free Time - Ha!) had the same<br/>\n&gt; &gt;overwhelming structure and pressure.  Claire was enjoying forming<br/>\n&gt; &gt;clay into a shape, then poking and sculpting it with a tool when she<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was told to make a mobile.  Stars and moons were set in front of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;here and she was told to quickly get going - with much rush and clapping.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;She ignored the instruction, thoroughly engrossed in what she was doing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I mentioned she seemed to be enjoying what she was already making.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I explained the same stuff to this teacher, once again, as I had done<br/>\n&gt; &gt;only moments early, just as I did with the other teacher.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Another tree trunk.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Gymnastics was even worse - but a better end to a story:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The teacher explained that no parents were permitted to cross the metal<br/>\n&gt; &gt;barrier. This was unacceptable to Claire, as the &quot;class&quot; was being held<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in the other corner of a huge gymnasium.  We bowed out but I hung out<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to check out her &quot;program&quot; and to watch what was supposedly free choice<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - using any and all of the gym equipment (one staying on the trampoline<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for as long as one wanted - and moving onto the rings if one chose to,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for example...)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The teacher sat upon a &#39;horse&#39; and had a big queen paper hat on.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;She sat upon this explaining something to all the children who sat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;around her below.  This went on for about 10 minutes.  The children<br/>\n&gt; &gt;all moved together - following the teachers instructions - back and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;forth - and then gathering around her again.  I have no idea<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what she was saying - her back was to me and she was far away...Seemed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to me, though, that these kids did little more than listen to the Queen<br/>\n&gt; &gt;talk.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;In front of us, though, there was a group of boys - 6 - from ages 5 to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about 11.  They were not sitting and listening to someone talk - they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;were *moving*. They jumped onto a &#39;horse&#39; from a spring board and flipped<br/>\n&gt; &gt;off onto a huge thick mat.  The teacher, Jean Pierre, invited Claire,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;who was watching and wanted to join in, into the line.  She did a few<br/>\n&gt; &gt;jumps and was having a ball.  They did &quot;tarzan&quot; on the rings, swinging<br/>\n&gt; &gt;out onto a huge mat. I took my shoes off and hung out by the edge of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mats - crossing the No Parent barrier.  The queen didn&#39;t kick me out<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and JP didn&#39;t seem to mind...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I asked later if it were possible for Claire to join the boys group.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;No way.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;She had to be in the baby class with only children her age (3/4).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This group - the *fun* group that *moved*, was only for boys.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve gone on much too long here - I just wanted to share that it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my experience that any activity (or class - or book or program or idea)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;*specifically designed for children*, often *stinks*.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It seems to me that incorporating children into the real world<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- of all that we are already doing or choose to do - offers so much.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And so, if I feel like doing pottery - or if Claire feels like doing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;some pottery - I&#39;ll get some clay and just do it.  Or take a class<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for adults and bring her with me.  She can join in without limits that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;are imposed on her simply because she is a child.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Last night, too, I saw a first ray of hope when Jean Luc, my husband,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;told me he did understand the no schooling thing - that he wished<br/>\n&gt; &gt;he had been free to choose to seek out freely what he wanted to know<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- and without testing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Thanks for reading my ramblings...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Diane McBryan Alignan<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(Hello again, Lesley)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5383,"nextTopicId":5347}}
