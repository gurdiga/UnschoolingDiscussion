At first, my kids were<br/>\nworried because they &quot;didn&#39;t do anything all day.&quot;  Because of their, albeit<br/>\nbrief, school experience, they believed that everything good came from<br/>\nworksheets (which they despised by the way).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think having younger siblings helps with the understanding.  I pointed out<br/>\nthat I thought the kids could learn anything and didn&#39;t need me to decide<br/>\nwhat they needed to know and to teach it to them.  I used the baby as an<br/>\nexample.  Who had taught her to sit up?  To crawl?  To walk?  To talk?  And<br/>\nin English, yet?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids were OK with that until Adriane hit a bump last year with the kids<br/>\nat gymnastics quizzing her on multiplication facts and laughingly pointing<br/>\nout that perhaps her mother shouldn&#39;t be teaching her.  Adriane wanted a<br/>\ncurriculum.  She was scared that life was going to pass her by, she would be<br/>\na failure, all because she didn&#39;t know 6x7 at the age of 10 off the top of<br/>\nher head.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did all the standard &quot;look what you know that they don&#39;t know&quot;, etc., but<br/>\nAdriane was really scared and sad.  So I dug out the old MathBlaster<br/>\ncomputer game and got her a Spelling type computer game (she was also<br/>\nworried about spelling).  Adriane worked day and night until she knew most<br/>\nof the multiplication stuff.  I pointed out to her that she wanted to learn<br/>\nsomething, she requested some resources and she taught herself.  VOILA!!<br/>\nUnschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids now are quite comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37161,"nextTopicId":37168}}
