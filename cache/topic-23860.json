Her dd only nurses for very short stints. But <br/>\nI did notice she nursed for a long time last night at dinner. The mother had <br/>\njust started on the wine. Over the course of Sunday she had had 2 full <br/>\nbottles and a mini bottle of wine. The 11 mos. dd was cranky and barely <br/>\nnursing. To me that is a hell of a lot of wine for a nursing mother to drink. <br/>\nBy bed last night the baby was again very fussy and irritable. Could be <br/>\nnormal fussiness or could be alcohol content IMO. She said the baby woke all <br/>\nnight every hour trying to nurse. During the day (w/out wine) this child is <br/>\nthe happiest baby I have ever seen. She is very cranky by evening. Which <br/>\ncould be normal but seems to me tied to the consumption rate that day.<br/>\n&#39;<br/>\n   Turns out over our visit this mother and I have very different views and <br/>\nmothering styles anyway so maybe I am just being overly .......something <br/>\ncan&#39;t think right now my neck is killing me.
