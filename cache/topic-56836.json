I do definitely think that those who have a<br/>\npassion for music will learn to play no matter what.  I don&#39;t know if my<br/>\ndaughter has a passion for it.

I cannot even carry a tune, but fortunately, both my children<br/>\nhave more musical ability than I.  I haven&#39;t given up though.

In spite of not <br/>\never practicing, Liam has always been REALLY good at whatever instrument he <br/>\nattempts and has been extremely focused during his lessons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently (well, today) suggested to DH that Liam might be more into <br/>\nplaying his guitar if he were learning to play the chords to the Songs that <br/>\nHe Likes rather than the notes on the first string of the guitar!  I <br/>\nremembered that I taught myself to play the guitar when I was a kid, and <br/>\nwhat I wanted to play were the songs I liked.  DH remembered that he taught <br/>\nhimself and learned from friends that same way, playing the songs he <br/>\nliked.  Then, when he got older and saw the need to learn more theory, <br/>\netc., he found a teacher and dedicated himself to it.  Now, DH is really a <br/>\nworld-class player (jazz and classical).  That&#39;s because he has and has <br/>\nalways had the passion for it.  Me, too (having the passion for playing the <br/>\ninstrument, I mean), although I wouldn&#39;t call myself  anything near being a <br/>\nworld-class player.  But, I am a pretty competent player, and I&#39;m happy <br/>\nwith my playing and always trying to get better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think passion for something can be like a budding flower, and it&#39;s very <br/>\nsusceptible to the elements.  I can see that Liam has the competence for <br/>\nplaying an instrument; he just needs the passion.  He loves music, and Liam <br/>\nwas a little surprised and delighted when I suggested to him that he could <br/>\nlearn to play the songs he likes right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad DH saw my point and is going to lay off the Hal Leonard method <br/>\nbooks for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts (while I&#39;m supposed to be working).<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":6958287,"authorName":"Jim Selvage","from":"&quot;Jim Selvage&quot; &lt;jselvage@...&gt;","profile":"jselvage_jemj","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Piano Lessons, etc.","postDate":"1043781872","msgId":56881,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMDEwMWMyYzcwMiRlNjYzM2FjMCQwMTAwYThjMEBocHBhdmlsaW9uPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE4Mi4xNWVmZDIzZC4yYjY4MjdmZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56866,"nextInTopic":56886,"prevInTime":56880,"nextInTime":56882,"topicId":56836,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra, Thanks, that is exactly what I needed to hear!
