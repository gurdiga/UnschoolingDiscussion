He is learning a lot about people and toddlers and diapers <br/>\netc. so I guess it is one big unschooling experiment! We are somewhat limited <br/>\nby Lesley Ann&#39;s needs , but she is pretty portable, with breastfeeding and <br/>\nall. We haven&#39;t missed out on much, we find it worth it, tho it is a shock to <br/>\ngo back, and I feel my age while chasing her around when we go places. Good <br/>\nluck, I would dearly love to have one more, but my husband says he would only <br/>\nvisit me on weekends!!
