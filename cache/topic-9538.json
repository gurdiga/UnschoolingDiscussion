I was making over $10 an hour full time and <br/>\n&gt;had full benefits and Employee Stock Ownership and was soon to be vested in <br/>\n&gt;the 401K.  But I quit when I was 8 months pregnant with my first, and I <br/>\n&gt;always knew that I would, for my children.  Luckily my husband was able to <br/>\n&gt;support us, also had investment and benefits, and enjoyed his work a great <br/>\n&gt;deal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It was a natural choice and a very easy one.  I sometimes regretted the <br/>\n&gt;loss of working friends and getting out of the house, etc, but it was just <br/>\n&gt;a lifestyle change that required an adjustment for me.  I am happily <br/>\n&gt;adjusted now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Why are we so often pressured by society that we don&#39;t measure up and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;aren&#39;t real women if we prefer the domestic life and make our children <br/>\n&gt; &gt;our priority?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I agree.

I started an at home business that is very ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-890343789\">Sonia:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I didn&#39;t give up our second income, we found a way to have <br/>\nboth the kids and the work.  I started an at home business that is very <br/>\nsuccessful, that I work around my kids.  Now I could probably make twice as <br/>\nmuch if I went back to my old profession and went out of the house and dumped <br/>\nthem in daycare, but I just can&#39;t bring myself to do that.  When our son Zak <br/>\nwas 11 months old we moved from Las Vegas to Tucson, to be close to my <br/>\nparents and so that Zak would have grandparents.  I was also not willing to <br/>\ndo daycare and needed to find something else.  My husband got out of the <br/>\nairforce and got unemployment for a while of $156 per week.  I didn&#39;t have a <br/>\njob and we just bought a house with $800 mortgage payment.  We had $5000 in <br/>\nsavings and I said to people &quot;I&#39;m going to start a new business&quot;  The <br/>\nresponse was you are crazy, you should go work for someone else.  My husband <br/>\nthen announced he hated being a Fireman and wanted to get into computers and <br/>\nso that&#39;s what he was going to do.  So in effect we both changed our careers. <br/>\n What started off as one thing for me has moved into something different.  I <br/>\nnow help people with making sure their careers and relationships are moving <br/>\nin the best direction for growth in all other aspects of their lives.  This <br/>\nis not quite what I started out to do.  My husband got a seasonal job <br/>\nlearning computers with Intuit (tax people) went on to another company to do <br/>\ntechnical support, went back to school with the GI Bill and graduates on <br/>\nSaturday with his BA in Computer Managment.  He then kept taking new jobs <br/>\nevery 9 months that gave him more money and paid for him to take more <br/>\ncertifications.  After 4 years he&#39;s a Network Manager with a very large <br/>\ncompany here in Tucson.  Did we have problems with not paying our credit <br/>\ncards and mortgage???  Sure we did... But so what.. We are not our credit <br/>\nreport and eventually that all got sorted out to where our credit is in good <br/>\nstanding (seems to be very important in this country).  We didn&#39;t do daycare <br/>\nin all of this and at the beginning Steve worked from 2pm-11pm and I worked <br/>\nin the mornings, so our son had both of us.  This continued until he was <br/>\nabout 3 and Steve started working more regular hours.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that we have Max as well we are re-evaluating how simple life was when we <br/>\njust had Zak and how much time we put into him.  We&#39;ve noticed that it&#39;s easy <br/>\nto get caught up in the money and what it can get us.  But for us it take us <br/>\naway from the basics of what we wanted to do which was raise our own kids, <br/>\nhence the idea of unschooling for us.  So now we are spending our time <br/>\nfiguring out how Steve can get back to the place he was at so that he&#39;s more <br/>\ninvolved and that we do this as a shared experience, which will benefit our <br/>\nboys enormously.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I abhore about the feminist movement is this idea that <br/>\nraising children is somehow beneath women and that the goal of a woman should <br/>\nbe to make money.  When did the almighty dollar become the most important <br/>\nthing in life.  Doesn&#39;t seem to make Donald Trump, Demi Moore, Bill Gates or <br/>\nanyone else who has buckets of it, very happy.  I believe you can have both <br/>\nthe stimulation of working with adults and children if you do what it is you <br/>\nlove and turn it into a career that you fit around your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my clients asked me last night about having more children and I asked <br/>\nher &quot;what would be the point?  You already have an 8 yr old and 5 yrd old <br/>\nthat dumped in daycare at 6 weeks and you went back to corporate america, so <br/>\nhow would having anymore benefit that child?&quot;  She said she&#39;d never thought <br/>\nabout it that way.... (Daycare is a big issue for me)..<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway that&#39;s enough rambling for me... It&#39;s thunder and lightening at 5:30am <br/>\nhere in Tucson and here I am with my cup of tea knowing that all my boys <br/>\n(including hubbie) are safely asleep in their beds.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sonia Ulan","from":"Sonia Ulan &lt;sulan@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"5ZwPx6l7XVcTl7zmQNuucCAmC7u5R7BGWz8n4psZ21tt9H-3ICibNpqYEpg3IqYPcqaHT4EOcQ6ia29OMkLLlapS","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Changing friends b/c of homeschooling","postDate":"961666422","msgId":9678,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5NTFERDc2LkEzQzIxNjgxQGhvbWUuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDAwNjIyMTg0NTExLjk2MTExLnFtYWlsQGhvdG1haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9677,"nextInTopic":9683,"prevInTime":9677,"nextInTime":9679,"topicId":9538,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Nanci, it takes real courage to go against the norm and form your own path.

That took guts.  My husband and I are fairly worried about our<br/>\nfinancial future as our income is about to drop by $20,000.00 - and we<br/>\nweren&#39;t earning the &quot;big bucks&quot; at that either!  My husband isn&#39;t happy<br/>\nwith his current position and is considering a career change.  He just<br/>\nearned his MCSE and will see about a new job in the computer field as<br/>\nwell...It&#39;s a tough sacrifice to leave one position to start at the<br/>\nbottom and break into a new one.  But I am determined to not put the<br/>\nkids in public school (for &quot;free&quot; babysitting) or daycare if I have to<br/>\nstart working again.   My husband and I are prepared to work shifts too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NumoAstro@...\">NumoAstro@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sonia:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband and I didn&#39;t give up our second income, we found a way to have<br/>\n&gt; both the kids and the work.  I started an at home business that is very<br/>\n&gt; successful, that I work around my kids.  Now I could probably make twice as<br/>\n&gt; much if I went back to my old profession and went out of the house and dumped<br/>\n&gt; them in daycare, but I just can&#39;t bring myself to do that.  When our son Zak<br/>\n&gt; was 11 months old we moved from Las Vegas to Tucson, to be close to my<br/>\n&gt; parents and so that Zak would have grandparents.  I was also not willing to<br/>\n&gt; do daycare and needed to find something else.  My husband got out of the<br/>\n&gt; airforce and got unemployment for a while of $156 per week.  I didn&#39;t have a<br/>\n&gt; job and we just bought a house with $800 mortgage payment.  We had $5000 in<br/>\n&gt; savings and I said to people &quot;I&#39;m going to start a new business&quot;  The<br/>\n&gt; response was you are crazy, you should go work for someone else.  My husband<br/>\n&gt; then announced he hated being a Fireman and wanted to get into computers and<br/>\n&gt; so that&#39;s what he was going to do.  So in effect we both changed our careers.<br/>\n&gt;  What started off as one thing for me has moved into something different.  I<br/>\n&gt; now help people with making sure their careers and relationships are moving<br/>\n&gt; in the best direction for growth in all other aspects of their lives.  This<br/>\n&gt; is not quite what I started out to do.  My husband got a seasonal job<br/>\n&gt; learning computers with Intuit (tax people) went on to another company to do<br/>\n&gt; technical support, went back to school with the GI Bill and graduates on<br/>\n&gt; Saturday with his BA in Computer Managment.  He then kept taking new jobs<br/>\n&gt; every 9 months that gave him more money and paid for him to take more<br/>\n&gt; certifications.  After 4 years he&#39;s a Network Manager with a very large<br/>\n&gt; company here in Tucson.  Did we have problems with not paying our credit<br/>\n&gt; cards and mortgage???  Sure we did... But so what.. We are not our credit<br/>\n&gt; report and eventually that all got sorted out to where our credit is in good<br/>\n&gt; standing (seems to be very important in this country).  We didn&#39;t do daycare<br/>\n&gt; in all of this and at the beginning Steve worked from 2pm-11pm and I worked<br/>\n&gt; in the mornings, so our son had both of us.  This continued until he was<br/>\n&gt; about 3 and Steve started working more regular hours.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now that we have Max as well we are re-evaluating how simple life was when we<br/>\n&gt; just had Zak and how much time we put into him.  We&#39;ve noticed that it&#39;s easy<br/>\n&gt; to get caught up in the money and what it can get us.  But for us it take us<br/>\n&gt; away from the basics of what we wanted to do which was raise our own kids,<br/>\n&gt; hence the idea of unschooling for us.  So now we are spending our time<br/>\n&gt; figuring out how Steve can get back to the place he was at so that he&#39;s more<br/>\n&gt; involved and that we do this as a shared experience, which will benefit our<br/>\n&gt; boys enormously.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of the things I abhore about the feminist movement is this idea that<br/>\n&gt; raising children is somehow beneath women and that the goal of a woman should<br/>\n&gt; be to make money.  When did the almighty dollar become the most important<br/>\n&gt; thing in life.  Doesn&#39;t seem to make Donald Trump, Demi Moore, Bill Gates or<br/>\n&gt; anyone else who has buckets of it, very happy.  I believe you can have both<br/>\n&gt; the stimulation of working with adults and children if you do what it is you<br/>\n&gt; love and turn it into a career that you fit around your family.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of my clients asked me last night about having more children and I asked<br/>\n&gt; her &quot;what would be the point?  You already have an 8 yr old and 5 yrd old<br/>\n&gt; that dumped in daycare at 6 weeks and you went back to corporate america, so<br/>\n&gt; how would having anymore benefit that child?&quot;  She said she&#39;d never thought<br/>\n&gt; about it that way.... (Daycare is a big issue for me)..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway that&#39;s enough rambling for me... It&#39;s thunder and lightening at 5:30am<br/>\n&gt; here in Tucson and here I am with my cup of tea knowing that all my boys<br/>\n&gt; (including hubbie) are safely asleep in their beds.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dawn F<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; SALESFORCE.COM MAKES SOFTWARE OBSOLETE<br/>\n&gt; Secure, online sales force automation with 5 users FREE for 1 year!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/2658/14/_/448294/_/961677819/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/2658/14/_/448294/_/961677819/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To Unsubscribe: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"HPaulson5@aol.com","from":"HPaulson5@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"TiWtAwZoDBmOCMnkSNxhIb_uyhHg7JtlFv6Y4SehN1d-4UQAdNMFZ7otxFkWy6yr2dMELHmIRFo","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Changing friends b/c of homeschooling","postDate":"961645378","msgId":9581,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJkLjQ3YWJmNGMuMjY4MmU1NDJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":9579,"nextInTopic":9589,"prevInTime":9580,"nextInTime":9582,"topicId":9538,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/21/00 4:31:12 PM Central Daylight Time, x_t_sipr@mindspring.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-730341591\">In a message dated 6/21/00 4:31:12 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:x_t_sipr@...\">x_t_sipr@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; wellllllllll*, if this DOES happen to you, Dawn F, ***cheer up***, you&#39;ll<br/>\n find soon find a new circle of like~minded h-s&#39;ing friends to fill that<br/>\n space!!!

I<br/>\ntalked<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my best friend yesterday who is having marriage problems, compounded by<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fact that he kids are really wild since attending pre-school and she was<br/>\n&gt; sort<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of quiet about the whole thing (except for the screaming and shouting<br/>\nshe<br/>\n&gt; did<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to her kids, while we were on the phone)... She did say she couldn&#39;t do<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because she would kill them as they drove her crazy now without being<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them all day and of course that brought up all fears in me of being<br/>\n&gt; &quot;stuck&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with 2 screaming children and I&#39;d be helpless.  That thought quickly<br/>\n&gt; passed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when I realized I was in a different kind of marriage to her and had 2<br/>\n&gt; very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different children to her.  My husband decided this morning to devise a<br/>\n&gt; plan<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to give to his boss where he trains somebody else up to the next level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whereby they can have the office covered (he&#39;s in computers) from 5am -<br/>\n&gt; 9pm.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He is also going to suggest that he works from 5am -1pm and the other<br/>\nguy<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other 8 hours.  This way he&#39;ll be able to be at home as well in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; afternoons with the kids.  This has also helped with my fears of &quot;can I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cope&quot;...  Hubbie says if they won&#39;t go for it, I&#39;ll quit and start my<br/>\nown<br/>\n&gt; &gt; business, which is the goal anyway.

She includes dd in her<br/>\ngreetings, but does not call, no longer invites us over and does not<br/>\nreturn letters. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it&#39;s just natural that you drift apart from some people. I was<br/>\nsaddened this past Memorial Day weekend when I realized I was drifting<br/>\nfrom my old college friends. We got along really well when I was<br/>\ndrinking and partying. Now that I&#39;m married and a mom, I have nothing to<br/>\ntalk about with them (how many times can you listen to the same &quot;I was<br/>\nsoooooo drunk&quot; story?).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you are real friends then the friendship survives. If you are<br/>\nonly friends cuz of something external (go to the same college, both<br/>\nlike to drink, both breastfeed etc.) then that friendship will not last<br/>\nwhen that external factor is gone (graduate, go on the wagon, the child<br/>\nweans, etc). Boy, do I sound like an after school special?
