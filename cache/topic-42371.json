Sometimes I think something like Homer Simpson and <br/>\nhis &quot;18 And You&#39;re OUT the DOOR! WhOO!&quot; I just get so excited at the idea <br/>\nthat by the time I am 40 both my kids will be 18 or over. Most of the time I <br/>\nwant them to stay with me forever, but sometimes that emotional immaturity <br/>\ncreeps in. I often wonder if I would have been a more patient parent if I had <br/>\nwaited till I was in my late 20&#39;s or even into my 30&#39;s to have kids. <br/>\nObviously I wouldn&#39;t have the ones I have now. &lt;g&gt; My Mom says I am so laid <br/>\nback it amazes her. She says she could have never just sent us kids out to <br/>\nplay, or let us paint at the table without her being right there. It really <br/>\namazes me what my Mom thinks is being laid back, and what I think is being <br/>\nlaid back. I don&#39;t think kids need me to direct something they already know <br/>\nhow to do. (like play) But I can get a big fit of the screaming mimis when I <br/>\nsuddenly decide the house needs to be cleaned up and everywhere I look I see <br/>\nkids, toys, books, magazines, paper, glue, paint, an assorted collection of <br/>\noutside nature inside, the dog, games, videos, food, more kids... My Mom, <br/>\ncould deal with situations like that. Actually, situations like that didn&#39;t <br/>\nhappen too often, and if they did, she probably had a sweet smile on her face <br/>\nand a wooden spoon behind her back, so maybe my screaming isn&#39;t quite as bad. <br/>\nBut I think maybe it is. My Mom thinks I am laid back, I think I need to be <br/>\nmore laid back, and sometimes I think that would have happened if I had <br/>\nwaited to have kids. Other times, I think I would have been more like my Mom. <br/>\nWould I have been a better Mom if I had waited? Maybe, but then I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave the kids I have now! :o)<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Swordplay, Weapons and Violence","postDate":"1030640635","msgId":42495,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDgyOTEwMDE0Ny4wMWNlMzJjMEBwb3AuaXNsYW5kbmV0LmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFhYi43OTQxOTQ2LjJhOWY4MGZiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":42487,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":42494,"nextInTime":42496,"topicId":42371,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It hurts some things.<br/>\n<br/>\n    The silly thing is, they have never even asked to play guns.  I don&#39;t know why I am even worried, except that so much of what I have done in the past has been aimed at preventing problems.  Unschooling is so much about fully living in the here and now ... it&#39;s still hard to make that shift in some areas.  I feel like I am giving up all vestiges of parental control, and then I think more about it and realize I *have* no parental control.  Their choices are their own.  I am sure I could get them to comply, but at what cost?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt;&gt;I would talk to them instead of putting toys up.  If talking doesn&#39;t work, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>    then maybe.  But not for a really long time. The trust between parent and child is worth way more than any rules about toy weapons, and when moms are calling all the rules and making dire predictions and shaming their kids, pretty much those predictions turn out NOT to be <br/>\n    true, and so the child&#39;s trust in the mother erodes a little.  And the peace of the house is disturbed more by arguments and begging and the negativity of all that than the &quot;danger&quot; one plastic sword, or water gun, or cap pistol would bring to a house where the mother is willing to listen to her son and the son is then more likely to want to listen to his mother.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Once it is put like that, I find it simple to agree.  I wish I already had those thoughts internalized, but when I measure how much I have already grown I know I am at least on the right track, and at 35 with my oldest only 9 1/2, I still have time.

REALLY in the SCA.  <br/>\nMy sons are 16 and 13 and have always had &quot;boffers,&quot; always been with and <br/>\naround sword-fighting guys.

Marty owns three knives.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s his &quot;knife collection.&quot;  We got him a Leatherman for Christmas, and he <br/>\ntakes good care of it, but very rarely takes it anywhere.  Even when I say <br/>\n&quot;Marty, take your leatherman&quot; when we&#39;re going camping or to a birthday party <br/>\nwhere gift-opening might be a problem, he forgets.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And can I still ban guns? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can, but it doesn&#39;t help anything.

One of Kirbys favorite toys of all time was <br/>\nthe plastic sword that came with a &quot;NeNardo costume&quot; when he was three.  A <br/>\nNinja Turtle costume with a VERY cool sword with the turtles logo embossed in <br/>\nthe blade.  I wish we still had it, or another like it.

This feels <br/>\n&gt; too much like a gift with strings.  Am I being ridiculous here?  Did any of <br/>\n&gt; you involved with SCA have similar feelings?  I know weaponry is a really <br/>\n&gt; big part of the Middle ages.  And can I still ban guns?

I know the former <br/>\n&gt; would be really great for their imagination, but I also know that they <br/>\n&gt; would really prefer them to look authentic.
