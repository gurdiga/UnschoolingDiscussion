No one even figured it out until I was in the 11th grade, my<br/>\naccounting teacher finally figured out what was wrong.  I would get the<br/>\nright answers but how I go to it would be all wrong, he finally figured out<br/>\nI inverted almost all of my numbers.  I don&#39;t really have many problems with<br/>\nnumbers anymore tho, once it was pointed out to me, I never really realized<br/>\nwhat I was doing until then.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;It takes him 10 to 15 minutes to read one type written page.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is really to bad, because it doesn&#39;t have to be this way. I do read<br/>\nslower then most people, and if im tired I have to read things a few times<br/>\nto get what it says.  No matter how hard the PS tried they never shot down<br/>\nmy self esteem, and I never give up.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Chaelene actually sees the letters moving and changing positions while<br/>\nshe is looking at them.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nActaully this isn&#39;t as bad as it sounds.  Since she can see it happening,<br/>\nshe should know, or will learn, that she should look at it again.  Makes you<br/>\nslower, but you don&#39;t make as many mistakes, and with time you get faster.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I hate to say it but sometimes it is hard to be patient and I feel like I<br/>\nam going to scream.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand how fusterating it must get for you.  Our society is based<br/>\noff the PS, and there set standards.  Kids are supposed to be at a certian<br/>\nplace at a certian time.  Well, you&#39;ll have to through that out the window,<br/>\nshe isn&#39;t going to be able to do it overnight.  The &quot;programs&quot; that &quot;drill&quot;<br/>\ndyslexics often do more harm then good, although I hear they are getting<br/>\nbetter.  No longer is it thought that dyslexics just see things wrong, we<br/>\nactually think differently, more abstract I think is a good word.  Also she<br/>\nmight enjoy activites that are geared more towards kinetic learners, I&#39;m a<br/>\nhuge kinectic learner and I&#39;ve talked to other dyslexics that are also.<br/>\n<br/>\nBec,<br/>\nCamano Island Homeschoolers,<br/>\nWashington Unschoolers,<br/>\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/Washingtonunschoolers/<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.342 / Virus Database: 189 - Release Date: 3/14/02<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34750,"nextTopicId":34812}}
