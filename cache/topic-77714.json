So rather than say &quot;Many don&#39;t understand <br/>\nit until they have a real-world need,&quot; they set up a situation in which they <br/>\nask the other to think back to personal experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nA longer dialog where more questions are asked like &quot;Why would someone want <br/>\nto do that anyway?&quot;  &quot;What WOULD you do if he didn&#39;t?&quot;  &quot;What&#39;s the worst that <br/>\ncan happen?&quot;  &quot;What is the purpose for it, ultimately?&quot; can be leading someone <br/>\ntoward a pre-thought goal.   In a one-on-one (as Socrates worked often) or in <br/>\na voluntary exchange like this, why would there be any risk of humiliation?  <br/>\nWe&#39;re not calling on anyone to state their answers to those questions.
