I happen to have the last issue of &quot;Growing Without <br/>\n&gt;Schooling&quot;  (fantastic mag - SO sad they&#39;re gone) that had the annual <br/>\n&gt;list of subscribers.  (Jan/Feb 2001)  If you do not have access to <br/>\n&gt;that and would like to see if there are families in your area, I would <br/>\n&gt;be happy to help.  Just send me a personal email with your zip code and <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ll be happy to send you the names and addresses of the families whose <br/>\n&gt;zips are closest to yours. (Knowing the name of the town might also <br/>\n&gt;make it easier for me to scan (there&#39;s 1.3 columns of names for VA <br/>\n&gt;and it&#39;s fairly small print - so maybe there&#39;ll be a lead!) <br/>\n&gt;Good luck!
