But - that doesn&#39;t mean I know <br/>\nanything about their real lives - one way or the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d have to agree that it would be disconcerting to discover that they <br/>\nnever unschooled. BUT - to be fair - what Pat talks about is learning <br/>\nwithout a curriculum, etc., he is generally talking to audiences filled <br/>\nwith people who are trying to select the perfect curriculum and he&#39;s <br/>\ntrying to get them to at least step away from that. Maybe that&#39;s as far <br/>\nas they ever went - not using a formal curriculum, but still teaching <br/>\n&quot;lessons&quot; etc., of their own mix and match design. I don&#39;t think that <br/>\nwould be terribly surprising. Whether they are unschooling or not - <br/>\nmight be subject to interpretation, I guess. And I can tell you that we <br/>\nwill never all agree fully on a definition.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids sometimes do &quot;courses&quot; and stuff like that. Some of you would <br/>\nundoubtedly argue that they are no longer unschooling when they sign up <br/>\nfor an online writing course at &quot;secret school,&quot; for example. I think <br/>\nyou&#39;re wrong - but I don&#39;t care enough to argue extensively about it.  <br/>\nWhen these things are truly child-chosen (if not initiated) with no <br/>\npressure or compulsion from parents or other adults - I don&#39;t see <br/>\n&quot;writing course&quot; as any different than a karate class or soccer team <br/>\nmembership. I think it is a bias against intellectual pursuits that <br/>\nrears its head occasionally among unschoolers. My 12 yo daughter has <br/>\nhomework - assigned by her 4H club horse leader. She gets tested on it. <br/>\nHow to help her learn that material is a useful thing for me - she&#39;s <br/>\nreading from a manual and will, this next year, be using a <br/>\ncollege-level textbook on equine studies. It is tough stuff and if I <br/>\ncan learn to help her, that&#39;s a good thing because she LOVES it and <br/>\nreally really wants to gain the knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - again - please don&#39;t say that I think anything, one way or the <br/>\nother about whether or not they are unschooling.
