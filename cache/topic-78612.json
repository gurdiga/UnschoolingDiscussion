We&#39;re going to try to catch the 6:40 am flight to San Jose, <br/>\nwhich gets in at 9 am or so.  Then we sit for about 3 hours and then its <br/>\nreally crunch time as we try to get the flight from San Jose to Kansas City <br/>\n(booked 139) which goes on to Raleigh/Durham, NC.  Keep your fingers <br/>\ncrossed.  If you hadn&#39;t already guessed, we fly standby.  Hubby&#39;s a pilot <br/>\nwith Southwest and has a thing about not buying tickets since &quot;he&quot; can fly <br/>\nfor free.  Anyway...IF all goes well, we will arrive in Raleigh by 9:30 pm <br/>\nEastern standard time!  Whoooo.  Then its 8 or 9 days tripping around the <br/>\nstate sighting seeing and down to Charleston and back to Columbia and then <br/>\ncatching up with hubby and the conference!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope to meet some of you all there for the first time....<br/>\n<br/>\nYour friendly lurker from the Seattle area....wish us luck!!<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina Morrissey<br/>\n<br/>\nTravis (almost 15)<br/>\nErin (11)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78581,"nextTopicId":78614}}
