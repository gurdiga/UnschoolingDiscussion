He is wide shouldered and very strong. Built like a bull. He<br/>\ngets frustrated very easily. He has been labeled dyslexic and bipolar. I<br/>\nknow I struggle with these labels. I just wonder sometimes...:) It&#39;s<br/>\nhard to be a teenager no matter what year we are in. There are so many<br/>\nup&#39;s and down&#39;s. He was &quot;tortured&quot; for the nine years he was in public<br/>\nschool. What a farce that was... Last night he swore at me at Costco&#39;s<br/>\nin front of a crowd using the &quot;f&quot; word about 6 times. He walked out of<br/>\nthe place. It was over a game I couldn&#39;t afford. Everything was fine an<br/>\nhour later. I know he still isn&#39;t used to the idea of unschooling. He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t understand the &quot;unrules&quot; since he has had so very many adults in<br/>\nhis life - actual teams of adults - giving him rules upon rules. The<br/>\ntension in our house has gone down 80% since we began unschooling. We<br/>\nare on our 12th hour of Oregon Trail here today. He is READING on his<br/>\nown and they said he COULDN&#39;T. I am not saying much to him except to<br/>\nhelp him out with one or two &quot;big&quot; words and say &quot;isn&#39;t this great!&quot; He<br/>\nis off all med&#39;s. Lost 16 pounds. It&#39; s been a very short time since we<br/>\nbegan this new journey in our lives. I know it is only going to get<br/>\nbetter!
