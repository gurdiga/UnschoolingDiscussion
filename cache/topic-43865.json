Play lots of games, read aloud to <br/>\nthem, dig in the dirt, cook, run around, play dressups, sing songs, bang on <br/>\nthe piano, play with a tape recorder, build with legos or blocks, do puzzles, <br/>\ndraw and paint and color wildly......<br/>\n<br/>\nYour job is to look at all the things they do and get in touch with WHY they <br/>\nare doing them - what are they learning?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are ALWAYS learning if it is something they are choosing to do <br/>\nthemselves. Learning is the same as living IF a person is free to choose how <br/>\nto live their own life.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep a journal for a while, jotting down the learning you see happening, <br/>\nuntil you don&#39;t need to anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\nThe National Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43859,"nextTopicId":43767}}
