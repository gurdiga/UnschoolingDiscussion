As John Holt tells us, the job of parenting is to give<br/>\nchildren access to the world, and that doesn&#39;t mean the school world which<br/>\nis totally artificial. Einstein is talking about freedom from what schools<br/>\ndo. Unschooling is the key, and it means Anything Except what schools do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of unschooling as letting your child&#39;s own life begin, in which the<br/>\nchild begins to take the reins and control his/her own learning. Unschooling<br/>\nparents accept the truth that learning is happening all day, every day. We<br/>\naccept that we cannot be aware, nor can even our children, of what is<br/>\nentering their minds as &quot;learning&quot; and what is being filtered away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we must do is trust that if we have provided them with tools and access<br/>\nand the freedom to choose what interests them, we are doing the best we can.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40753,"nextTopicId":40755}}
