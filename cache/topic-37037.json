Happiness is apparently not all that easy and not all that <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; common. I WONDER if maybe that&#39;s because it wasn&#39;t encouraged in people <br/>\n&gt; when <br/>\n&gt; they were children.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It seems that people start hanging out at the self-help section of the <br/>\nlibraries/bookstores at about thirty years old. Let&#39;s say they&#39;re in school <br/>\nfor 12/13 years (add more for preschool, day care, etc.), then college for <br/>\n4/5 and maybe graduate school of some sort---then add all those years up. <br/>\nTack on the year or three after &quot;graduation&quot; when they STILL believe that <br/>\nschool&#39;s good for you. I&#39;m guessing that with the one month per year of  <br/>\n&quot;education&quot; of deschooling necessary, thirty is about the right age for <br/>\npeople to start looking for &quot;something&quot;---happiness or peace or their <br/>\n&quot;souls&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother-in-law said that she just wanted her children to be happy adults. <br/>\nSeems to me that the best path there is to have happy childhoods. My goal is <br/>\nhappy childhoods for my children. I think the happy adulthood will follow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37036,"nextTopicId":37060}}
