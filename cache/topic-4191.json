I tend to be a person who tries out many <br/>\nthings and jumps back and forth from interest to interest.  Some of these <br/>\nstay with me for life and others just don&#39;t turn out to be a good fit.<br/>\n     My 15 yr old son and I are taking a Physical Geology class with Lab this <br/>\nsemester (his first college class and my first in over ten years).  I am so <br/>\nglad I am in it with him because the instructor is unbelievably difficult.  <br/>\nHe insults students regularly, including us, and seems irritated when we <br/>\nactually try to learn the subject rather than just copy down the answers he <br/>\nposts as the Lab progresses.  He&#39;s like a really bad high school teacher and <br/>\na great reminder of why I would never put my kids in public school again.  <br/>\nBefore this class, I had a very positive view of college teachers and <br/>\nclasses.  I had 59 units of general ed. and had actually loved every class I <br/>\nhad taken.  I had told Justin how great college is, how the teachers treat <br/>\nyou with more respect and aren&#39;t so discipline oriented and then we get this <br/>\nguy.  We have chosen to finish out because we only have a month and a half <br/>\nleft for our credits but at least we both knew we could drop if we chose to.  <br/>\n<br/>\n        Lucy in Calif.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Natrlmama@xxx.xxx","from":"Natrlmama@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"VPmCD3pUn1cKdlD51r6zR067-NO3CYSbY4WPo89g8Gws4oDmhNfo4MQSfLO_GXcSoW1AkbAM_OY","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: quitters?","postDate":"941655762","msgId":4191,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNzkuNDE5MS45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4247,"prevInTime":4190,"nextInTime":4192,"topicId":4191,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/03/1999 8:10:54 AM Pacific Standard Time, tn-k4of5@if.rmci.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1307302478\">In a message dated 11/03/1999 8:10:54 AM Pacific Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tn-k4of5@...\">tn-k4of5@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  I think it makes much more sense towards a<br/>\n person&#39;s emotional health to teach them that it is OK to not do something<br/>\n anymore if it is not good for them, or they do not enjoy it.
