I think it was Massachusetts Mutual. We decided not to<br/>\nhave a homebirth because of the sudden and still unexplained problems our<br/>\noldest had at birth (greenish skin tone, bad smell, cord not pulsing,<br/>\nhypotonic, seizures, etc.) which led to 2 weeks in the NICU.  It was the<br/>\nscariest thing that has ever happened to me.  The second was big, healthy<br/>\nand everything went perfectly.  The third was medium-sized, healthy and<br/>\neverything went perfectly.   I still regret not having a homebirth, but I<br/>\nwas too scared.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarjorie<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Paula Sjogerman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sjogy@...\">sjogy@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Saturday, January 17, 2004 7:50 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Digest Number 4406<br/>\n<br/>\non 1/17/04 5:36 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And I know of no insurance<br/>\n&gt; that covers a homebirth.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Both my homebirths were covered by insurance.
