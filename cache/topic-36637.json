Walked towards the Exit, and found<br/>\nmyself face to face with a Dunkin Donuts.  I about fell over in shock!  (And<br/>\nyes, I did splurge and take a dozen home to my family!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s soldiers spent several weeks debating whether a 14-hour<br/>\n(one-way) train trip to Rome to get donuts was too ridiculous.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36625,"nextTopicId":36151}}
