I knew no other hsers <br/>\nbut one family who did school at home, which I didn&#39;t feel would work in our <br/>\nsituation, but figured a tiny bit of structure would be needed.  However, my <br/>\noldest son&#39;s intense need to deschool led directly to unschooling, and we <br/>\nnever looked back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boys are now very nearly 21 (2 weeks) and 18.  The elder is in the Army, <br/>\nhas been since before he turned 18, and is doing very well.  Getting him in <br/>\nthe Army was a challenge, as our Clonlara diploma was not recognized as <br/>\nvalid.  But we got past that hurdle, then 6 weeks after Chris joined, my dh <br/>\nretired from the Army, and we left TX to move onto our land in MI, where we <br/>\nnow have a small farm.  The younger son left home a few weeks after his 18th <br/>\nbirthday to move *back* to TX :) where he&#39;s employed by an Internet ecommerce <br/>\ncompany, and making a very nice salary along with 80 hour workweeks.  <br/>\nPersonally, I hope he quits and finds something less stressful, but that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat he wants for now :)<br/>\n <br/>\nMy youngest child is a girl, 8 going on 18, who is exceptionally sensitive <br/>\nand strongwilled, so life is never dull.  At the moment she&#39;s minding the <br/>\nbatch of 28 baby chicks we picked up this morning.  We still unschool, in the <br/>\nmanner I&#39;ve been told is nowadays called &#39;radical unschooling&#39;, meaning, I&#39;m <br/>\ntold, folks who don&#39;t use unit studies.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the comment.  Susan wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; imo the fact that you wanted to learn piano and the opportunity to acquire <br/>\nthis skill was not afforded to you would say to me that you were not <br/>\nunschooled because your parents did not respect your desires and did not <br/>\nfollow your lead.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI strongly disagree with this :)  Unschooling, IMO, is indeed about following <br/>\nthe child&#39;s lead--I like to refer to it as child-led learning.  However, <br/>\nparents are not obligated to allow the child to lead anywhere she wants!  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think you&#39;d let your child lead you to give her lessons in arson, if <br/>\nshe were interested in burning things, would you? :)  There are always limits <br/>\nin the real world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my daughter had her way, we&#39;d provide gymnastics, swimming, horseback <br/>\nriding, piano lessons, and a host of other enriching activities.  I would <br/>\nlove to give her ample opportunity for each and every one of these <br/>\nactivities, but there&#39;s a few problems.  One, there&#39;s simply not enough time <br/>\nto do all these things; Two, we don&#39;t have the money; and Three, she is not <br/>\nreal serious about any of the ones she&#39;s tried so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I can work out lessons that I feel are of the quality that provides <br/>\nlearning with respect, for a reasonable amount of money or labor (I have <br/>\nbartered my labor for her lessons with friends), I give my daughter chances <br/>\nto try different activities.  But when she doesn&#39;t follow through on her end <br/>\nof the deal--for example, wearing the safety equipment needed, or placing her <br/>\nhands on the keys like her teachers says--then it&#39;s time to rethink the <br/>\nlessons.  Periodically we&#39;ll give her a new chance to try if she&#39;s still <br/>\ninterested, and if she&#39;s willing to be fully cooperative with the <br/>\nrestrictions inherent in the situation, then lessons will continue as long as <br/>\nshe is cooperative and we can work out any other problems.  But I&#39;m under no <br/>\nobligation to provide opportunities to someone who won&#39;t appreciate and make <br/>\nthe most of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my child had a burning *need* to do something--for example, a child who is <br/>\na serious competitive swimmer, or who finds that music, or animals, or <br/>\nwhatever, is her life, then I would move heaven and earth to provide that <br/>\nopportunity.  But most kids are just experimenting, which is fine, if done <br/>\nwith the understanding that it not take over the family&#39;s time and income.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, so much for my plan to lurk :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hjshaltz@...\">hjshaltz@...</a><br/>\nHJS Studio and Shaltz Farm Shetlands and Angora Rabbits<br/>\nList Mom, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FiberFlock@onelist.com\">FiberFlock@onelist.com</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FiberProfessionals@onelist.com\">FiberProfessionals@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8220,"nextTopicId":8226}}
