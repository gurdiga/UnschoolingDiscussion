new connection to something familiar, allowing each of us to gradually build on our unique understanding of the world. &nbsp;That learning can be inspired by something as personal as how one prefers to address washroom practices. &nbsp;What shape that learning takes depends on how one addresses the experience. &nbsp;</span><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial,

VIII had a Groom of the Stool? &nbsp;I didn&#39;t. &nbsp;But I was thinking about my son&#39;s practices when he was younger, after thinking about something written here, after thinking about this question about how bathroom practices are part of unschooling, leading me to wonder if royalty at one point had someone looking after these personal needs, which further led me to look it up and find a little piece of writing on a site called Historic UK about the job of Groom of the Stool. &nbsp;This led me to remember a book Doug, Ethan and I read at night together for a while called &quot;Worst Jobs in History,&quot; and reflect briefly on some of the ways our simple bodily functions and the byproducts of those functions have been made into jobs of some sort, somehow. &nbsp;</div><div

of any kind to happen naturally at any time, is crucial, I think, to successful unschooling and successful life-long learning. &nbsp;The parent from the original question has an opportunity to learn more about her son. &nbsp;Her son, if given room to do so, has an opportunity to learn more about himself. &nbsp;Where that learning will take them depends on how open they are to the many opportunities that initial position offers. &nbsp;</div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34,

his own facing similar challenges. &nbsp;He might have a friend of a friend of a friend with questions. &nbsp;He might read a book or watch a program that prompts him to draw on his own experiences, allowing him make a unique link in the chain of his own understanding of the world. &nbsp;Or, he might never think of it directly again. &nbsp;But how this parent and child move forward will influence future learning in some subtle or greater way because that&#39;s how we build our model of the world--one humble, or profound, or everything-in-between experience at a time. &nbsp;The more we can be open to that, the bigger and more interconnected our model of the world will become.</div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;\"

</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-1651270583MsoNormal\">Thanks, Melissa</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-1651270583MsoNormal\">  </p><p><span><br></span></p>\n\n\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\n    <div style=\"color:#fff;min-height:0;\"></div>\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote></div>\n </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":443923164,"authorName":"CASS KOTRBA","from":"CASS KOTRBA &lt;caskot@...&gt;","profile":"cass.kotrba","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Dealing with obsessive behavior.","postDate":"1438705171","msgId":76087,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENPTDEzMC1XNTNDRkNFRUNFMEY4MUEzNDZGMkJEM0M0NzYwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PDg2NThERDY1MjM5MzRDQkJBMEQyNEU0NTRFMzYxMkNGQE5ld1BDPg==","referencesHeader":"PG1wcDhnNisxM29ranZhQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4sPDg2NThERDY1MjM5MzRDQkJBMEQyNEU0NTRFMzYxMkNGQE5ld1BDPg=="},"prevInTopic":76086,"nextInTopic":76089,"prevInTime":76086,"nextInTime":76088,"topicId":76080,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-. -=-  IÆd love to take a vacation, but there is no way we could leave the bathroom behind. -=- We have a smallish hard shell camper that acts as a home","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1294860311\"><html>\n<head>\n<style><!--\n#ygrps-yiv-1294860311 .ygrps-yiv-1294860311hmmessage P\n{\nmargin:0px;padding:0px;}\n#ygrps-yiv-1294860311 .ygrps-yiv-1294860311hmmessage\n{\nfont-size:12pt;font-family:Calibri;}\n--></style></head>\n<div dir='ltr'><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1294860311ecxygrp-mlmsg\" style=\"\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1294860311ecxygrp-msg\" style=\"\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size:1px;\">-=-.</span></div>\n</div>\n\n  <img width=\"1\" height=\"1\">&nbsp;-=-&nbsp;<span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;line-height:16.25px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">&nbsp;I’d love to take a vacation, but there is no way we could leave the bathroom behind. -=-</span><div><font color=\"#3f3f3f\" face=\"Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:16.25px;\"><br></span></font></div><div><font color=\"#3f3f3f\" face=\"Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:16.25px;\">We have a smallish hard shell camper that acts as a home away from home for us and allows us to take short trips. &nbsp;It has a little toilet that flushes, a small shower and a kitchen sink. &nbsp;We pile in all of our familiar bedding and stuff in there (honestly, we never shower but use it as storage). &nbsp;Having that camper makes it easier for us to get away and still feel safe. &nbsp;We feel like we have a mini version of our home with us.

(This is a new camper for us. &nbsp;We had a pop up for 11 years and while it was very comfortable to stay in we were not able to pull off and use it easily. &nbsp;The new camper is smaller but the

Parents pull that germ <br/>\ncard a lot when they&#39;re trying to get their kids to always remember to wash <br/>\ntheir hands after going potty, to not touch other people&#39;s things, to not <br/>\nshare their ice cream with the dog, etc., and one pretty logical consequence <br/>\nof that is some can become overly grossed out by the knowledge germs are <br/>\neverywhere. (Can you imagine how - was it Leeuwenhoek? - felt when he <br/>\ndiscovered his drinking water was teaming with living creatures?)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I took care of my mom who had dementia, and no sense of personal <br/>\nhygiene, I became obsessed about disinfecting everything she might have <br/>\ntouched. I knew it was excessive, but I still did it. It may have been a <br/>\nresponse to things that were out of my control, or it may have been stress <br/>\nor tiredness contributing, but I understand that even something that&#39;s a <br/>\npain in the ass, can feel important.  He&#39;s not wrong. Germs are everywhere. <br/>\nYou will leave some on your leg if you accidentally touch it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can, without shaming or anger or accusation, sometimes point out that <br/>\nno one else in the family has a schedule or showers after poo and they&#39;re <br/>\nok. If you press it, it could make him more insecure, but if you find a way <br/>\nto talk about it matter-of-factly, you might help him think of things he <br/>\nhadn&#39;t considered before.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have funny and horrible poop stories from when he or his brother were <br/>\nbabies? Funny stories about pooping in the woods while camping. How many <br/>\nshit idioms can you think of together: You can give someone shit. You won&#39;t <br/>\ntake any shit off anyone. You were so surprised you shit a brick. (Imagine <br/>\nshowering with bricks?) You can have a shit eating grin, or be in deep shit, <br/>\nor beat the crap out of someone. I&#39;m thinking if you can find ways (both of <br/>\nyou) to relax and think of funny shit, and crap, it might begin to bring <br/>\nthings into a more normal perspective. I think lots of people are weird in <br/>\nthe bathroom (weird or icky) it&#39;s that most we never know about. We know <br/>\nabout our kids (and old mothers) because we&#39;re in there with them. The rest <br/>\nof us have blissful privacy in which we can be weird without witnesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s an inconvenience for you now, and if it&#39;s a behavior that stays with <br/>\nhim forever it&#39;ll be an inconvenience for him. Lot&#39;s of people live with <br/>\ninconvenience because on some level it makes them feel better. Some people <br/>\nlive with religious dietary or work restrictions, or other religious <br/>\nrituals. We don&#39;t necessarily think of those as nutty, and lots of people <br/>\nwho do those things are otherwise normal and happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably it&#39;s something he&#39;ll work out. In the meantime there are personal <br/>\nwipes that claim to kill germs. The expense might be worth the time saved in <br/>\nshowering. There are bidet attachments for regular toilets.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":342782030,"authorName":"K Pennell","from":"K Pennell &lt;mrsringsabre@...&gt;","profile":"mrsringsabre","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Dealing with obsessive behavior.","postDate":"1438693624","msgId":76085,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":true,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NTM0MjQ0NjkuMzk3MTM2LjE0Mzg2OTM2MjQ3OTMuSmF2YU1haWwueWFob29AbWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PG1wcDhnNisxM29ranZhQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG1wcDhnNisxM29ranZhQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76084,"nextInTopic":76086,"prevInTime":76084,"nextInTime":76086,"topicId":76080,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 13 yo, Griffin, really wantsto go out more but during the day we don’t go because Quinn doesn’t want to be homealone.  Griff and I often will goout","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2084075882\"><html><div style=\"color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\"><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-2084075882yui_3_16_0_1_1438690757656_5620\"><i id=\"ygrps-yiv-2084075882yui_3_16_0_1_1438690757656_5760\">My 13 yo, Griffin, really wants\nto go out more but during the day we don’t go because Quinn doesn’t want to be home\nalone.&nbsp; Griff and I often will go\nout after my Husband gets home.&nbsp;\nGriffin is usually fine with this, but I can tell he gets frustrated\nthat we can’t get up and go. <br></i></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2084075882yui_3_16_0_1_1438690757656_5919\" dir=\"ltr\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2084075882yui_3_16_0_1_1438690757656_5920\" dir=\"ltr\">Is there a relative or family friend you could get to stay with Quinn during the day?

If it&#39;s something you all feel willing to wait out for a while, maybe that is the best course of action at the moment, if you can manage to still get to outings and your older son isn&#39;t missing out because of it?<br><br>How does your son feel about his schedule? Does he feel anxious about it? Does he want it to stop? Does he feel like it&#39;s getting out of his control and stopping him doing things and going places? If it&#39;s feeling like a problem to him, i&#39;d certainly consider talking to someone about it - one of the counselors or therapists on Sandra&#39;s page. I don&#39;t&nbsp;think you need to tell him it&#39;s &#39;all in his head&#39; to discuss it? Just ask him how he feels about it?<br><br>My husband also suggests an unschooling friendly counselor. His brother didn&#39;t get counselling as a child, but has seen people about his ongoing OCD&#39;s as an adult and found it helpful - I think he wishes he had seen someone earlier.<div><br></div><div>All the best,</div><div>Jo<br><div><div style=\"color:#fff;height:0;\"></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <style><!--\n#ygrps-yiv-1614804987 .ygrps-yiv-1614804987ExternalClass

search at Amazon just now, and there are personal portable bidets. &nbsp;Perhaps your son would be willing to try this and use one in place of a shower when he is away from home. &nbsp;Maybe he&#39;d like to pick one out for himself.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#39;ve shared this story before, but my son had a really hard time throwing out wrappers when he was younger. &nbsp;It felt very sentimental to him if he had touched something, and having it discarded made him feel incredibly sad. &nbsp;He told me he thought the wrapper was lonely. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know why he felt that way. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t ask or argue. &nbsp;I kept the wrappers and cans and boxes for a couple years (after washing them), storing them in boxes and baskets around the house. &nbsp;When we went on a longer trip, I saved his wrappers, and mailed them back to us in a box I picked up from a grocery store. &nbsp;The postage cost us $20 or something, but like Sandra says, that&#39;s way cheaper than therapy would have been later on, and it seemed so important to him. &nbsp;<br><br>Ethan outgrew the need to save things. &nbsp;I say outgrew. &nbsp;I don&#39;t really know what changed, or why he didn&#39;t feel the need to hold on to everything any more. &nbsp;I&#39;m not sure what I would have done if it had gone on very long, but for that period of time, I was able to store his things without being inconvenienced. &nbsp;Just last night he told me that even in a game he likes to play he used to have a hard time using the potions and items he found because he was sad when they were gone. &nbsp;Similar mindset, it sounds like. &nbsp;Again, I&#39;m not sure what changed for him, but I think our unconditional support and room to come to his own resolutions didn&#39;t hurt. &nbsp;<br><br>We talked with Ethan about what would work out best for him, and came to some solutions we could all live with. &nbsp;Perhaps that would work for your son and your family as well. &nbsp;Maybe setting timers on your phone and assuring him you&#39;ll do your best to not miss his scheduled washroom break would allow him to take small steps away from home, leading to bigger steps when he is ready. &nbsp;<br><br>Karen

I think the clock is more important than his bowels or bladder.  He will never use the toilet without showering (which is a bit inconvenient due to our ongoing drought in CA! -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t make him feel guilty about drought; that won&#39;t help him OR the drought.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he&#39;ll be able to wipe easier if you get gloves for him.  At Sally Beauty (and probably other places, but I know their stock on this) you can get latex or non-latex in boxes, so he could use singles or doubles.  They&#39;re not in pairs, and will fit either hand—several sizes, too.  I used to use them to pick up dog poop, and more recently for snails.  Show him how to pull them off inside out so the dirty part is like in a trash bag already, and won&#39;t be touched by anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn India, there are sprayers in some newer houses that people can use.  MAYBE (maybe) a spray bottle with water to spritz before or after he wipes (or both) could prevent a full shower, and if not—I&#39;d consider the showers a medical necessity and not worry about outside issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers here might have better ideas, but it seems maybe you could tell him that when he&#39;s grown and has his own place, he can set his schedule however he wants to, but for now you have other obligations that keep you from being his fulltime assistant.  It&#39;s really asking a lot, seems to me, for him to be setting arbitrary schedules in a home trying to get away from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo stories that might be discouraging or encouraging, but they&#39;re data.<br/>\nMy husband is very methodical and regular but there are variations and seasons.  For a few weeks he might wake up at the same time at night and go to the bathroom.  Then for a while, sleeps through.  Or when he was going to work, he always went to the toilet at the same time of day (within fifteen minutes) and when he was home, it didn&#39;t work the same way. So there might have been other triggers or factors.  He thought about it, but we didn&#39;t do a full analysis.  It was just a curiosity more than anything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have another friend who can&#39;t poop anywhere but his own home.  He did, at my house, one time, and was fairly proud of himself for being able to do that.  He was in his 30&#39;s.  We talked about why, and what his feelings were about it.  He was hugely disturbed by the idea that anyone might hear him, so when he went, I turned music up loud and made noises that indicated I was two rooms away, and other people in the house were off doing other things.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThose might or might not have useful clues, but there are people who grow up with oddities and live happy lives. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do hope things go easier for you, and if you need someone to talk to who won&#39;t say &quot;put him in school; that will be $130,&quot; try someone here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy\">http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":386666394,"authorName":"","from":"boisei@...","profile":"melgqd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Dealing with obsessive behavior.","postDate":"1438655814","msgId":76080,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG1wcDhnNisxM29ranZhQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":76081,"prevInTime":76079,"nextInTime":76081,"topicId":76080,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All, I have two boys 13 and 10.
