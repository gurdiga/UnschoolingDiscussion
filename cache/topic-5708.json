My husband & I both grew up in Charlotte, not the<br/>\nbiggest but still holds it&#39;s own.  Now we live in a VERY rural area & have<br/>\nto drive 25-30 minutes to NEAREST store (only 1 grocery store in town) and<br/>\n40-45 minutes to Walmart, library, YMCA, etc.   My husband got the job he&#39;s<br/>\nin now & I was finally able to stay home all the time, so we jumped at the<br/>\nchance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are SO TIRED of wasting whole days just to go to the library or to the<br/>\nstore.  I can&#39;t find any time to go that we don&#39;t have to eat out because<br/>\nwe&#39;re gone so long.  My husband also drives at least twice a week to MBA<br/>\nclasses aprx 1.5 hrs one way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe really like the rural part of where we live.  I have no fears sending the<br/>\nkids out to play by themselves (7 & 3).  I&#39;m never afraid and many times<br/>\nforget to lock my door.  BUT, I think I can get this all somewhat closer to<br/>\nreal civilization.  Even the town we go to for Walmart (Martinsville VA) is<br/>\ntoo small...we usually drive to Winston for real shopping and all our<br/>\ndoctors are either in Winston or still in Charlotte.  Luckily my family<br/>\nlives just north of Charlotte so we are able to &quot;get to town&quot; fairly often.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it&#39;s cheaper in the boonies, but think of all the gas, the tires on<br/>\nyour car, the TIME you spend commuting, the higher your odds of having an<br/>\naccident just because you&#39;re in your car so much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually grew up just north of the Charlotte city limits but went to<br/>\nCharlotte city schools.  My grandpa had cows, we had horses & lots of<br/>\nanimals...yet we were about 10 minutes from downtown Charlotte.  Now I know<br/>\nthat things have changed a lot in the last 35 years, but I contend that we<br/>\ncan find a place closer to a city, yet still offers all the advantages of<br/>\nrural life.....it just may not be quite as cheap as the boonies!<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully we will find our dream place this summer (or sooner) as my husband<br/>\nwill be finishing his MBA & looking for new opportunities.  Hopefully your<br/>\nfamily will find one too!<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5738,"nextTopicId":5734}}
