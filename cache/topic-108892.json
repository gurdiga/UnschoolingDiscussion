You don&#39;t say what is needs are, but are part of these needs communication based?  Do you need to work with him to find better ways for him to express himself? Is he frustrated from lack of words? <br/>\n <br/>\nAs for him helping pick up...  it starts at all different ages and maturity levels. My Jack is nine and helping out is hit and miss with him. But my little brother was the same way when he was little. He recently got married, but has been a bachelor for years and his housekeeping skills put mine to mortal shame. Moly OTOH, has been my helper from the get go. I remember having a spotless house in anticipation of a visit from my folks or Darin&#39;s mom, and within minutes of a grandparent sitting down Moly would have found all the microscopic dirt in the carpet and presented it to said grandparent with a self satisfied smile and a &#39;thear grandma&#39;. <br/>\n <br/>\nBut those cute stories don&#39;t help you. I suggest model behavior. Saying &#39;its time to pick up your room&#39; can be daunting to a child. Saying &#39;I&#39;m going to pick up those puzzle pieces in your room, will you please help?&#39;  gives them a bit more breathing room. It is one single task, you are going to help, a little less overwhelming. I used to grab three or four hula-hoops and throw them on the floor on top of a mess. Then everyone could grab a circle and just be responsible for that area, and a big, messy, Lego strewn, Barbie with her clothes and friends everywhere, room became less of a challenge and everyone was more or less equal in their responsibilities. <br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, do you need to evaluate your expectations on cleanliness, and helping out? Are they too high for a five year old? For a five year old with special needs? For a five year old who has been in a school setting for two years up until three weeks ago, who is still adjusting to a HUGE move in his life? <br/>\n <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanne &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oh.kneel@...\">oh.kneel@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nMy five year old throws things around when he is angry.
