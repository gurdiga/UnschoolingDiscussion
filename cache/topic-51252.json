As well as <br/>\nmany other issues.  We ALWAYS learn from our parents.. We either learned what <br/>\nworked, and remember what we loved ( and made us feel loved) and we pass that <br/>\non to our children,. Or, we learn what they did wrong, what we hated, and <br/>\nmade us feel awful , and we vow to not follow in thier footsteps.    <br/>\nSometimes, unfortunately, we learn the &quot;wrong ways&quot; and we continue the <br/>\nlegacy with our own children.   I hate that you have some bad memories, and <br/>\nthat you feel your needs were&#39;nt met by your parents,.. But, I am very glad <br/>\nfor you and your children that you didnt learned what NOT to do ..  I had <br/>\n(have) the best Mother in the world.  My had (have) a wonderful father too.  <br/>\nFor all the good stuff my Daddy is, for all he taught me that was right and <br/>\nvaluable, I love him dearly.   I learned other lessons from him too, lessons <br/>\nin what NOT to do.  Like be an alcoholic or marry one.     Many children of <br/>\nalcoholics grow up to be alcoholics themselves, but neither my sisters ( or <br/>\ntheir husband) nor I have ever had a drinking problem.. Heck, we really don&#39;t <br/>\neven drink, just a very occasional social cocktail.   <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, the way Sandra has forged her own path in raising her children and <br/>\ndiverged from her past, and the fact that children of alcoholics have grown <br/>\nup to NOT be drinkers,  is just more proof that we are not destined to turn <br/>\ninto our parents.   Although, I wish I could turn into my mother.. heck, I <br/>\nturned out so good,  I know she was perfect :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51240,"nextTopicId":51257}}
