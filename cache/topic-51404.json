This was a family we had known for years and their two daughters were close in age to my sister and me.  Anyway, we were being loud after &quot;light out&quot; and the dad came down and said if it happened again we wouldn&#39;t like it.  Well, it did happen again and he came stomping down the stairs - this big, intimidating father.  He told me, as the oldest, to come into his study for discipline.  I followed him and he said &quot;I&#39;m going to smack the desk with my belt and I want you to cry and scream like I&#39;m spanking you&quot;.  I was too terrified to cry or scream  when he hit the desk so he laughed and said &quot;Oh, go back to bed but you girls had better be quiet&quot;.  We were quiet after that!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause the parents were friends of my parents I never told my parents about that scary experience until this year.  My mom was shocked and said that I should have called her or at least told her the next day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51403,"nextTopicId":51414}}
