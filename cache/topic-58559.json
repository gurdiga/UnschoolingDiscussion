And it&#39;s also the hardest, because it is so <br/>\ndifficult to see your own kids struggle with things that come so <br/>\neasily to others. I was relatively lucky because my special needs kid <br/>\nwas my first, and I threw away books like &quot;What to Expect&quot; right off <br/>\nthe bat, so I really didn&#39;t know (except for that gut feeling) <br/>\nhow &quot;behind&quot; he was, or how much extra work I was putting in <br/>\nparenting him, over and above what you do with a &quot;normal&quot; kid. I only <br/>\nlearned that after I had my second kid and realized how easy it all <br/>\nis when you don&#39;t have to deal with all that extra stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are still things that my kid struggles with that other kids <br/>\ndon&#39;t, and I&#39;ve come to find that it&#39;s okay. But it doesn&#39;t make it <br/>\neasier when other people don&#39;t understand and give you &quot;The look&quot; <br/>\nbecause your kid is howling in protest that the floor is too cold and <br/>\nto him it feels like his feet are getting frozen on ice cubes, so <br/>\nhe&#39;s really upset, but to other people, he just looks like an overly <br/>\ncoddled brat having a tantrum (other people&#39;s thoughts, not mine). It <br/>\njust gets so wearing after awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis thread is very timely. My kid&#39;s &quot;disability&quot; doesn&#39;t pop up too <br/>\noften anymore, but when it does it can be a real whammy. These are <br/>\nthe times I most feel like an unschooling failure - like anything I <br/>\ndo is wrong. Yesterday it was The Haircut. He&#39;s been growing his hair <br/>\nlong for a year (fine by me), but he can&#39;t brush it himself (motor <br/>\nskills issues) and doesn&#39;t want me to brush it (extreme tactile <br/>\nsensitivity triggers a fight or flight response every single day when <br/>\nwe try), but he also doesn&#39;t want it to become all matted or to be in <br/>\ndreadlocks, and doesn&#39;t want to wash it or get it wet to make combing <br/>\nit any easier (again, tactile sensitivity). So he had asked me to <br/>\ncall our haircutting person and have her come over to our house (she <br/>\nis the only person who has ever been able to cut his hair, she is an <br/>\nangel with a ton of patience). But when our haircutter gets here, he <br/>\nstarts freaking out, very loudly vocally and physically. He is <br/>\ntotally scared by the idea of the haircut, but also unable to deal <br/>\nwith any of the other possibilities. So what the heck do I do? What <br/>\nends up happening is I hold him in my lap, he continues to freak out, <br/>\nand our hairdresser does the best job she can in the shortest amount <br/>\nof time. I&#39;m sure she has no idea what the heck is wrong with my kid, <br/>\nI attempt to explain some of it after he&#39;s disappeared upstairs. But <br/>\nif he hadn&#39;t gotten his hair cut, we would&#39;ve gone through the same <br/>\nfreak out every day over hair brushing. Yet he doesn&#39;t want no hair <br/>\nbrushing or no hair cut either, he *chose* the haircut without me <br/>\neven suggesting it. Now he&#39;s mourning the loss of his long hair, <br/>\nwhich he really wanted but was unable to deal with. It all feels very <br/>\nLose-Lose-situation to me, and I&#39;ve been pretty bummed over it. If I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have this child, I would think that you could go along <br/>\nrespecting a child and honoring their choices and it would all come <br/>\nout perfectly as it does with my daughter. But some kids teach you <br/>\notherwise. Some times there is no easy way. We&#39;ve been through this <br/>\nsame scenario in many different variations over the years. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has read this far, thanks for letting me ramble.

Those things that make them SHINE.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn Carol Stock Kranowitz&#39;s book *The Out of Sync Child,* she says <br/>\nsomething like, &quot;Even the best-loved child in the world will feel <br/>\nunloved.&quot;  I know what she&#39;s talking about.  It was my life.  It&#39;s my <br/>\nson&#39;s life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, they feel like many things are against them.  How you handle <br/>\nthat is key.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is imperative that you don&#39;t just write it off.  It is important <br/>\nto acknowledge how he feels.  How frustrated he is.  And, yes, how <br/>\ndifficult life can be for him at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then it&#39;s important to move on.  Don&#39;t dwell on the negative.  Go <br/>\non to something where he can SHINE.<br/>\n<br/>\nWHen my son is totally frustrated, I&#39;ll hug him and say, &quot;It&#39;s a <br/>\ndifficult job to be Jake, isn&#39;t it?&quot;  He&#39;ll collapse in my arms and <br/>\ncry.  And then I&#39;ll let him know that I think he&#39;s wonderful, and I <br/>\nthink he&#39;s doing a great job at being Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then we move on to those things that make him Jake.  We&#39;ll talk <br/>\nabout his comic strips that he draws, or his monsters.  We&#39;ll talk <br/>\nabout his video games, or the book he&#39;s reading.  Or we&#39;ll curl up <br/>\ntogether and read a book or watch a movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot of stress and anxiety in these children&#39;s lives.  Do <br/>\nwhat you can to move away from that and move towards the Joy and the <br/>\nLove and the Strengths.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no need to push anything new.  Let him stay where he is <br/>\ncomfortable.  Go to his world, in his place of comfort.  Meet him <br/>\nthere and get to know him there.  Let him enlighten your world and <br/>\nlet him know that his unique perspective on life enlightens your own <br/>\nlife.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime helps, also.  My son would try to draw a couple of years ago, <br/>\nand get so frustrated and cry.  A friend of mine told me the same <br/>\nstory about her 5 year old son.  He would draw something and take it <br/>\nto her and angrily say, &quot;Would you just throw this away because I <br/>\nHATE IT!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s what I said:  their vision does not match their physical <br/>\ncapabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son stopped drawing and began working with clay (Sculpey).  He was <br/>\nAMAZING with it.  He made Pokemon after Pokemon with it, and they <br/>\nwere WONDERFUL.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis helped his confidence, and his motor skills.  After awhile, he <br/>\ntried drawing again, and was better at it.  So he kept drawing.  Now <br/>\nhe&#39;s a wonderful artist and creates his own comic strips.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think most parents approach a frustrated child in the wrong <br/>\nmanner.  They always try to fix what went wrong.  That&#39;s not what the <br/>\nchild wants ~ especially these perfectionist children.  They want to <br/>\nfix it themselves.  And right now, they just want to be frustrated <br/>\nwith it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are learning.  They are learning about the world.  They are <br/>\nlearning about themselves.  They are learning how to handle having <br/>\nvideo games in their home.  They are learning how to handle <br/>\nfrustration and challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow YOU handle it and approach it will be their *teacher.*  <br/>\n<br/>\n~ Anne</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":56051484,"authorName":"grlynbl@aol.com","from":"grlynbl@...","profile":"tbb1967","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] re: special needs children...","postDate":"1045160663","msgId":58598,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI4LjMzODUyNjgyLjJiN2QzY2Q3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58597,"nextInTopic":58604,"prevInTime":58597,"nextInTime":58599,"topicId":58559,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/13/03 12:45:22 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

Then he gets upset and angry or sad.. he feels like &quot;nothing <br/>\nworks for him&quot;  , like everyone and everything is against him.

We didn&#39;t go to the park<br/>\nday yesterday, because we had to be out of the house Monday and today.  We<br/>\nall agreed that it would be better to have a day at home, even though we<br/>\nknew that we would have enjoyed the park while we were there.  Three days of<br/>\nactivities in a row is just too many for us.  When we are home all day, I<br/>\ncan alternate my chores and projects with spending time with them.  When we<br/>\nare on the go, either the house ends up a disaster or I&#39;m just not able to<br/>\nspend time with them because I need to do the household stuff.  Neither of<br/>\nthose makes me happy if it happens too often!  Also, my kids are more likely<br/>\nto get involved in a project of their own when we have long stretches of<br/>\ntime at home.  Our homeschool group had a Valentine&#39;s Party this week, but I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t even mention it to them.

But it doesn&#39;t take very many extra activities to throw<br/>\neverything off.  When people are all stressed and can&#39;t get ready to go to<br/>\nsomething that sounds like fun, I find myself wondering if they really don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to go.

Maybe give <br/>\nhim a punching bag or trampoline to work out some of those urges. Don&#39;t try <br/>\nto stop them, channel them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe channeling is difficult.  So much of the &quot;blow ups&quot;  are so impulsive and <br/>\nfast happening.  Before I can intervene, the remote control has been broken <br/>\ninto a thousand pieces.  Gosh, if I listed the damage these boys have done.. <br/>\nits unreal..  Holes in walls,  we only have 1 out of 6 dining room chairs <br/>\nleft.. numerous electronics (including a video camera), countless toys, games <br/>\nCDs, damage to our vehicles, furniture. its endless.  .. And this ties into <br/>\nyour next statement...<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I wouldn&#39;t keep replacing them forever. He has no incentive then <br/>\nto try a different method of displaying his anger. And anyway, it&#39;s just too <br/>\nexpensive. I&#39;m honest with my kids about how much we make and have and how <br/>\nmuch we can spend on things. If the money&#39;s not there, it&#39;s not there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey just dont understand how these damages affect our family.  If its one of <br/>\nthier own toys or belongings .. well, then, they no longer have that toy.  <br/>\nEven though sometimes I will replace it.. But for family stuff ( like the <br/>\ngame controllers) we are just out of luck and out of pocket to replace the <br/>\nstuff.. Our house looks like a war zone..  My husband has just given up on <br/>\nkeeping up repairs.. Most all of our doors are broken.( beaten or kicked in). <br/>\nwindows broken, holes in walls, peeled wall paper. Dh feels like its a losing <br/>\nbattle to keep things repaired.. and, really, it is.. We bought new entrance <br/>\ndoors over a  year ago.. Dh has never installed them.. Every time one of the <br/>\nboys knocks another chunk out of the doors, Dh says,.. see, Im glad that <br/>\nwasnt the new door.    This destructive behavior usually happens so fast, we <br/>\ncant stop it.  To &quot;channel&quot; thier aggression elsewhere would require CONSTANT <br/>\nsupervision., which seems unreasonable for kids thier age..( and really, <br/>\nimpossible) <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, tantrums happen. Some people are hard wired to naturally calm <br/>\nthemselves and deal with frustration. Others have to work at it. Venting, to <br/>\nme, is okay. Hitting, breaking things or hurting each other is not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree.. Everyone is different in the way they handle thier stress <br/>\nand frustration.  I see it so clearly among my own family.  My older son is <br/>\nmore &quot;verbal&quot;  my daughter more &quot;sulky&quot; and pouty.  The younger boys.. WHOOO <br/>\nWEEE, its all physical.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand. Do they generally have trouble with transitions? Casey (my 9yo <br/>\ndd) has a LOT of trouble transitioning to anything. Even things she loves<br/>\n<br/>\nYESS.. I written here before out the trouble they have with transistions.  <br/>\nOther parents have spoken of similar situations.  I try all of that <br/>\n&quot;beforehand&quot; stuff.. Sometimes it works, sometimes it just stresses them out <br/>\nbecause they start worrying that much sooner that they will have to make a <br/>\ntransition.   Here&#39;s a prime example. We had been planning on going to a hs <br/>\nvalentine party on Monday.  We made candy over the weekend.. made our <br/>\nvalentines.. talked about the party.. Everyone was excited..  But on Monday, <br/>\nEthan wouldnt get out of bed.  He normally gets up before anyone else to <br/>\n&quot;claim&quot; the game system.  But he wasnt up by noon.. The party was at  2..  I <br/>\nwent in around 12:30 to check on him.. He wasnt even asleep.  I said..&quot;Ethan, <br/>\nthe party is today .. you wanna get up and get ready?&quot;  He immedieatly <br/>\nstarted to protest and say he didnt want to go.  I assured him it would be <br/>\nfun.. lots of games, snacks, playing..  He insisted he didnt want to go.   I <br/>\nthought he might change his mind as Anna, JP and I got ready, but he didnt.  <br/>\nThe party was only a few minutes away from our house.. So, Iet him stay home. <br/>\n  I really didnt want to.. I knew that if I &quot;made&quot; him go, he would probably <br/>\nhave a good time.  AT LEAST he wouldnt be home alone.  But, I didnt make him. <br/>\n Of course, when JP and Anna got home, he wanted to eat thier candy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think folks who do not deal with this type of behavior do not understand <br/>\nthat these kids REALLY will not take the initiative on &quot;getting interested&quot; <br/>\nin things.. Yes, Ethan does have some interests ( very limited) and I do <br/>\neverything in my means to  make these things available, encourage and support <br/>\nhim in them.   But, I also know that if I dont encourage and sometimes even <br/>\ninsist that he go somewhere or try something new ,he would never know that he <br/>\nDOES like it.   Is that wrong????<br/>\n<br/>\n.  He is the same way about foods.  I dont &quot;make&quot; him try new foods.. but I <br/>\nhave paid him to taste something.. Lots of times he finds  out that he likes <br/>\nit!!!!.. I wish I didnt have to pay him to try something new.   Now, he went <br/>\nwith his Grandpa ( my Dad) to a BBQ one time.. He refused to eat.. Dad gave <br/>\nhim a plate and told him that if he was hungry , he better eat some.  ( yeah, <br/>\nold school, no BS Grandpa)   Well, Ethan tried it, and he LOVED it!!.. If <br/>\nthat had been me, I probably would have bought him some chicken tenders on <br/>\nthe way home and Ethan would have never known he liked BBQ.  <br/>\n  Oh.. I just reread that and I need to clarify.  I know, that if Ethan had <br/>\ntasted the BBQ and hated it.. His Grandpa would have never made him eat it.   <br/>\n Yeah, Ethan would have been hungry for a while., but he would have had to <br/>\nwait til they got home and then Grandpa( or most likely  Grandma)  would have <br/>\nmade him something he liked.. But the point is, Ethan didnt automatically <br/>\nassume that he would be &#39;catered&quot; to for his limited preferences in food, <br/>\nlike he does at home with me and his dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts easy for folks to say &quot;kids will do this or they will do that.. given <br/>\nenough time&quot;  But I think those are &quot;typical&quot; kids ..( I dont like labels <br/>\neither.. but I dont know any other way to describe it)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMary, you have been SOOOO helpful, sensitive and understanding..
