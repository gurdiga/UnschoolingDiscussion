There is good and bad in both media (not <br/>\nto mention art/clothing/food). It should be up to our children to decide <br/>\ncritically what&#39;s good and bad to *them*. If they can learn that when they&#39;re <br/>\nyoung, they won&#39;t sit and vege-out as adults! They will watch what they find <br/>\ninteresting ONLY.

You ought to see the Rosemond column in my local paper today, <br/>\nheadlined &quot;Mothers face hurdles with home-schooling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n       It&#39;s about a 6-year-old being hsed since August, after kindergarten at <br/>\nschool last year.<br/>\n<br/>\n       The mom writes that his motivation to work was &quot;never&quot; a problem at <br/>\nschool but he won&#39;t do his &quot;work&quot; for her at home.<br/>\n<br/>\n       &quot;I have beautiful and interesting hands-on Montessori materials for <br/>\nhim. Nonetheless, the [discipline] problems are nearly constant. Today for <br/>\nexample, he ended up in his room by 10am, allowed to have only books and no screen <br/>\ntime for the rest of the week. I punished him for complaining, for lying down <br/>\n(saying he was tired), not following directions and generally goofing off. Am <br/>\nI on the right page here?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n      Rosemond tells her yes. Put him back in school so he can be forced and <br/>\nbroken. You can&#39;t police him well enough on your own yet. (And naturally <br/>\npolicing and controlling and limiting are what learning is all about!)<br/>\n<br/>\n       As an unschooler, my sad thought was that the mom was honoring the <br/>\nbeautiful hand-on Montessori materials and HER need to obey her own internalized <br/>\nrules every minute of every day,  much more than she was willing to honor her <br/>\nliving, breathing, learning little boy. <br/>\n<br/>\n       Ironic, when you consider that Montessori materials are supposed to be <br/>\nall about first-hand, child-constructed learning and discovery. How could <br/>\neven a mom brainwashed by authority decide that Montessori should be forced on a <br/>\nschedule as &quot;work&quot;? How could she not see the daily deprivation she doggedly <br/>\ninflicts with her &quot;eat this with a smile, or starve&quot; power struggle approach to <br/>\na six-year-old? It&#39;s no different than power struggles over eating and <br/>\nchores, and imo it can induce similar disorders and disabilities. <br/>\n<br/>\n       Meanwhile, can there be much doubt that internalized rules create <br/>\nmisery for both parents and kids?<br/>\n<br/>\n      Obviously this mom isn&#39;t coming HERE for advice. She wanted confimation <br/>\nfor her authoritarian approach, and got it. (Doesn&#39;t mean she isn&#39;t miserable <br/>\nthough!)  The reason I bring it here is to show that even when your child is <br/>\nhome doesn&#39;t mean the spectre of school is lessened, unless you consciously <br/>\nand conscientiously make it so. <br/>\n<br/>\n       And also, to show even committed unschoolers stumble over an <br/>\ninternalized rule now and then. Blind spots, Joyce just called them.<br/>\n<br/>\n       For me it was never the badness of tv, thank goodness, but I did try <br/>\nhard for years to impose the &quot;goodness&quot; of arithmetic and daily piano practice. <br/>\nWith the predictable &quot;miserable&quot; results for all concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\n       In fairness, I didn&#39;t know then that what we were doing was considered <br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; -- we were making it up as we went along, without outside help <br/>\n-- but I see now that these were two unschooling blind spots that my <br/>\nfirst-born had to live through.

I guess I am trying to <br/>\nresolve two things here, the first is my own logical disconnect from <br/>\nmy understanding of unschooling and the role of TV (I just didn&#39;t <br/>\nexpect to find the enthusiasm for TV here that I did - feeling TV <br/>\nwas a bit schoolish) and the second thing was coming to terms with <br/>\nmy own issues surrounding TV in my own home.

The first question, <br/>\nI&#39;m pretty close on, but I have a ways to go on the second. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I don&#39;t put reading in the same category as TV since it <br/>\nleaves so much more to the imagination - relying on the reader to <br/>\ncreate a substantial body of original supplementary material, <br/>\nwhereas TV does so much of that for you.

I <br/>\nguess I am just someone who sees real value in a little boredom. I <br/>\nknow when my son has a few minutes of it, that&#39;s when his best ideas <br/>\nseem to hit, and I worry that the TV will interfere with that...

Here are some things I&#39;ve done to help me <br/>\ndeal.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe try to separate sources of noise as much as possible...one computer <br/>\nupstairs, one down; same with the video games.  Everybody is encouraged to shut <br/>\ndoors to avoid spreading noises to other parts of the house.  We have headphones <br/>\navailable for people to use when they are listening to things by themselves.  <br/>\nThese are used most often by Emily who likes to watch music DVD&#39;s on the main <br/>\nTV.  Everybody feels free to ask others to turn things down if they start to <br/>\nfeel stressed out by the noise levels.  We all try to be respectful of each <br/>\nother and take turns having our favorite *sources of noise* on.  Everybody also <br/>\nturns anything off if they&#39;ve stopped listening/watching.

She <br/>\nis playing with her toys, turning on her radio and singing along, <br/>\ngetting out her books and reading them, playing story games with me, <br/>\nplaying board games with me.  And, if the weather permits, we go to <br/>\nthe park a lot or go out do other things that we all enjoy as a <br/>\nfamily.  She can be really into a movie or tv show and, as soon as I <br/>\nsay, &quot;let&#39;s go play with Blue (her dog)&quot; she turns around and heads <br/>\nstraight for the back door.  Or if I say &quot;Karen, want to go out and <br/>\ndo _______&quot; she looks at me and yells &quot;yes!&quot;  Just make sure that <br/>\nthere are other options available to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the noise, I like to have the tv on for background noise <br/>\nmyself.

I threw<br/>\nsome food their direction at the proper times of the<br/>\nday, and that was about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo wonder they never turned off the tv!  I didn&#39;t sit<br/>\nand watch with them, I didn&#39;t make suggestions about<br/>\ngoing places or things we could do together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI kept thinking, &quot;when they have had enough they will<br/>\nturn it off and come ask me for something else to do.&quot;<br/>\n It wasn&#39;t until I read a post here that said<br/>\nsomething to the effect that turning on the tv and not<br/>\noffering (strewing) other things is not good.  That if<br/>\ntv is the only choice offered, why would they choose<br/>\nanything else?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow they choose to watch tv a lot, and we do, but I<br/>\nmight also say, &quot;Does anyone want to make cookies?  go<br/>\nto the store?  hey, the new air and space museum is<br/>\nopen, let&#39;s go check it out!&quot; and they are just as<br/>\nlikely to choose one of those things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother suggestion here that was most helpful to me<br/>\nwas not to just drop all restrictions all at once, but<br/>\nto just say &quot;yes&quot; more and more when asked, and ease<br/>\ninto it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I dropped all the restrictions at once the first<br/>\ntime we tried it, the kids were sort of scared and<br/>\nlost, didn&#39;t adjust well, and I threw up my hands and<br/>\ndeclared that unschooling didn&#39;t work and went back to<br/>\nour miserable way of doing things because it felt<br/>\nsafer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis time we eased into it a bit more slowly, and as<br/>\nwe (I) gained confidence, and said &quot;yes&quot; more and<br/>\nmore, the kids have felt safe and cared for and free<br/>\nall at once.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n--Susan in VA<br/>\nWifetoVegman<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.

By late morning the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2096191851\">So last week I decided to take the plunge and let the kids spend as much time as they wanted watching tv and playing on the computer.  By late morning the constant tv and computer noise was wearing on me.  I have the same reaction on the weekends when my husband&#39;s home.  He likes to have the tv on as background noise.  I don&#39;t think this is just the need for a paradigm shift on my part but I would like to get some feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan V <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90398,"nextTopicId":90910}}
