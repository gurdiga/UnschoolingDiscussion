How they can grow up to be <br/>\n  anything they want to be. Another scene was a (cartoon) princess who&#39;s father <br/>\n  wanted her to marry and she wanted to see the world.

Aimed <br/>\n  at the 4 to 8 y/o age group, but good for all ages. I think it was made in <br/>\n  1973 or 74. Anyway, I was asking Darin if he had ever seen it, and I was <br/>\n  surprised to learn that he had never seen it and had no clue what I was <br/>\n  talking about.
