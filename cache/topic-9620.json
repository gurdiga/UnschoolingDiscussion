I went to my library this morning and talked to the Branch <br/>\nManager who was wonderful..  I told her there were no books on unschooling <br/>\nand 7 on homeschooling and she asked me if I could suggest some. She said <br/>\nthey had plenty of money in their budget for those books.  I quickly whipped <br/>\nout my copy of The Unschooling Handbook and she ordered it from Amazon.com as <br/>\nwe were talking.  She asked me if there were anymore I could recommend.  I <br/>\ncould only think of the Colfax&#39;s book and didn&#39;t know if that was unschooling <br/>\nor homeschooling.  Anyway she ordered that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told her about the unschooling loop and she asked me to ask you for <br/>\nrecommendations of unschooling books.  She is more than willing to buy <br/>\nseveral more books if I can give her the names and authors...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo please let me have the names of books that you guys would recommend for <br/>\npeople who are insterested in unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9604,"nextTopicId":9629}}
