I think the (sometimes very insidious) lie is that all kids are <br/>\nsupposed to develop in lock step and when they don&#39;t, there is something wrong <br/>\nwith them.   I think that particular datum would have to be much more closely <br/>\nexamined than it is, in general, before we could determine if it had any <br/>\nvalidity at all, whatsoever, under any possible circumstance.  Minimally, kids <br/>\ndeveloping at different rates would need to be examined 20, 30 or even 50 years <br/>\nlater to see how they were doing in life.  Other factors would need to be <br/>\ncontrolled for (i.e. schooling, home life, health factors, etc).  Studies like that <br/>\nare difficult to do and there is not much (if any) financial incentive for <br/>\ndoing them.  Maybe some have been done, I don&#39;t know of any personally (I&#39;d love <br/>\nto hear about any others may know of).  My view is that until science has <br/>\nproven that kids encouraged and/or manipulated into developing with the &quot;norm&quot; are <br/>\nbetter off than kids allowed to develop at their own pace and given love and <br/>\nrespect and stimulation, I&#39;m going with my own personal observations and my <br/>\ngut.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so glad I found this group!  I&#39;ve been unschooling for a couple of years <br/>\nnow after my kids had bad experiences in school.  We&#39;ve had some wonderful and <br/>\nprecious experiences doing this, but lately it&#39;s been going rougher, <br/>\nespecially with my younger child, and I really need this daily infusion of wisdom and <br/>\nencouragement from others who are doing this.  Thanks for being there!<br/>\n<br/>\nCory<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":86381,"nextTopicId":86468}}
