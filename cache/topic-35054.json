Actually, I think that ps might have the <br/>\nopposite effect and<br/>\ncould turn a quiet, homebody into a total introvert.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI think schools make a BIG difference in how kids feel about themselves as <br/>\nsocial beings, and in how their natural bent on the introvert/extrovert <br/>\nspectrum gets expressed. Social butterflys can become clique leader <br/>\nterrorists. The shy and quiet withdraw permanently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what passes for socialization in schools damages everyone, the <br/>\nunpopular and the popular alike. What passes for interaction between boys and <br/>\ngirls in junior high schools damages both sexes. Many never get over it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman beings truly aren&#39;t meant to be raised in packs, but that&#39;s what <br/>\nhappens when we send them to schools. They spend a large part of each day <br/>\nsurrounded by others who are just as unskilled at civilzation as they are, <br/>\ntold to &quot;work things out&quot; by outnumbered adults without being given the <br/>\nskills and guidance necessary to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a newish middle school in a nearby town that holds 2100 students in <br/>\n6th - 8th grades. That&#39;s just about the scariest thing I can think of <br/>\n(outside of wars and other disasters) - that many hormonally challenged <br/>\npeople all bouncing off of each other every day all day.
