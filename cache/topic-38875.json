When <br/>\nJack went to school last year, they didn&#39;t call any snow days, and we had a <br/>\nfew that needed to be called. In the district we live in the kids walk to <br/>\nschool if they live 2 miles or less from the school. Many of these kids had <br/>\nto walk through this. I was so pissed when I took Jack to school and saw all <br/>\nthese kids walking. I was ticked already because I had to go out in the <br/>\nweather... (I guess I didn&#39;t HAVE to, but...) I made a statement to the <br/>\nprincipal and she informed me that these kids have no where else to go. The <br/>\ndistrict had set specific standards on snow depth, wind chill factor and <br/>\ntemperature in dealing with snow days. She told me that many of the children <br/>\nwould get their only hot meal of the day at school and if there was no <br/>\nschool, there would be no food. She also informed me that many children would <br/>\nbe left alone if there was no school, and how would I feel about a 5 year old <br/>\nbeing left alone all day? I informed her I was all for the hot meals and the <br/>\noh so wonderful baby-sitting service the district provided to the poor in our <br/>\ncommunity, but what good would it all do if the kids were frozen to death! (I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think she liked me much &lt;g&gt;) <br/>\nAny way, movements to lower the mandatory attendance age, removing snow days, <br/>\nlengthening the school day are all part of the governments fingers grasping <br/>\nat our children.<br/>\nThen there are all the things done in the name of Brown here in my town that <br/>\nreally flabbergasts me!<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38898,"nextTopicId":38879}}
