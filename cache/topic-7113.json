So I explained to<br/>\nhim about day and night, and we made a model of the solar system with<br/>\nmandarin oranges and a table lamp (shade removed).  We found some great<br/>\nwebsites, and now he knows so much about the solar system.  Though we do<br/>\nsome simple role playing sometimes (usually after he&#39;s had some trouble<br/>\nwith his friends), I don&#39;t teach him much except by example.  Mostly he<br/>\nteaches himself.  If he has a question, I answer, and sometimes he wants<br/>\nmore info.  So we go look it up together.  &quot;What does this word say?&quot;<br/>\nhas become the phrase of the month.  (his, not mine)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds to me like what you&#39;re doing is unschooling - you don&#39;t need<br/>\nour approval, anywho.  Helping your children follow their interests is,<br/>\nIMO, unschooling.  Sometimes I expand on Mook&#39;s interests a little.  Say<br/>\nfor example, Pokemon.  (Mook couldn&#39;t care less about pokemon, but I<br/>\nhear it&#39;s really big everywhere - not just in Japan)  Pokemon comes from<br/>\nJapan, so you could learn related stuff about Japan.  Like, the Japanese<br/>\npronounce Pokemon poh*keh*moh*ng (and anime is pronounced ah*nee*meh),<br/>\netc.  Maybe they&#39;ll want to know other Japanese words, so you search the<br/>\ninternet, or get a tape from the library, and before you know it,<br/>\nthey&#39;re learning Japanese.  Or history, or math, or who knows what<br/>\nelse.  It&#39;s amazing how one thing leads to another.  Just by following<br/>\ntheir interests.  Sometimes something just dies out.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is not worrying about what you &quot;should&quot; be doing.  Just<br/>\nlearning in a way that works for you and the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMelanie in Japan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7112,"nextTopicId":7111}}
