I love that <br/>\nabout unschooling, and it reminds of something I read long ago, maybe somebody <br/>\nwill remember where this comes from.  I read so much I can never remember <br/>\nsources!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have different capabilities to reach certain levels of mastery in <br/>\nvarious subjects. At a certain point, the work required to reach the next level of <br/>\nmastery becomes exponentially greater, and for some people, that is not a <br/>\nhard reach, as they have the ability to comprehend large batches of that kind of <br/>\ninfo at a time,  and for others, the time and energy involved would be <br/>\nincredibly large to improve a small amount of skills or knowledge.   <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, a friend of mine has taken the GED four or five times since she <br/>\ndropped out of school.  She has studied and gone to classes for years now, but <br/>\neach time she takes the test, she only improves by a few points, still not <br/>\npassing.  For her, the skills that she must develop to pass take her an <br/>\nextraordinary amount of time and effort to develop.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat girl has saved my ass quite a few times in life. lol  We&#39;ve known each <br/>\nother since about 5th grade, and she is street smart in ways I have never even <br/>\ntried to understand.  My mind just doesn&#39;t work that way, and it&#39;s so funny <br/>\nwhen she tries to explain something to me, it&#39;s the same as when I am teaching <br/>\nher how to diagram sentences, blank looks and confused questions.  We just have <br/>\nradically different ways of being in the world.  She&#39;s told me before, for <br/>\nsuch a smart girl, you sure are stupid.  ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nWe help each other out when we can, but most of the time we give up, it just <br/>\ntakes too much time and energy to explain.

And you would just have to do too much to your own brain to <br/>\ncomprehend the VCR.  The point is, if you WANT to, you can, but it would mean spending <br/>\na long time on a learning plateau first, before the understanding would come. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI love this idea, and I love that it explains why &quot;well rounded education&quot; <br/>\ncan really only go so far.  When people reach these learning plateaus, it&#39;s <br/>\nridiculous to expect students to work thru them.  You can only do so when YOU <br/>\nREALLY WANT TO.  There has to be an incredible amt of motivation and passion <br/>\nbehind it for it to happen eventually.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout my friend, she&#39;s taking the damn test again soon.  She feels she has <br/>\nto.  I can&#39;t talk her out of it, and so I&#39;m helping her as best I can. I <br/>\nunderstand her well enough that I can explain things in a way that&#39;s not as hard for <br/>\nher to process, and she&#39;s improving.  She gets frustrated with how slow the <br/>\ngoing is, and of course, when I first started explaining learning plateaus, she <br/>\nhad no idea what I&#39;m talking about, but she&#39;s starting to understand that too. <br/>\n She&#39;s not as hard on herself anymore.
