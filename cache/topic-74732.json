My husband and I have welcomed our <br/>\nchildren in our &quot;family bed&quot; for ten years now, and it has *not* <br/>\naffected our marriage or our sex life.  With communication and <br/>\ncreativity *everyone* can get their needs met.<br/>\nYou seem to have set up a dichotomy in your mind... it&#39;s either <br/>\nbeing &quot;consumed with children&quot; or having a happy, healthy marriage <br/>\nwith children kept in their place (away from parents) at night.<br/>\nThere is a lot of middle ground in between that you seem to have <br/>\npurposefully overlooked.<br/>\nFor us, what works has changed over the years.  When the older two <br/>\nwere little and both in our king-sized bed we always had an <br/>\nalternate place to go in the house (after they were asleep) when we <br/>\nwanted to be alone at night.  These days our youngest is happy to <br/>\nstart off the night in a room shared with his brother (he falls <br/>\nasleep quickly while being read to and having his back rubbed by me <br/>\nor his Dad) with the understanding that if and when he wakes up in <br/>\nthe night he&#39;s welcome to join us right across the hall.  This way <br/>\nwe get a few hours in the early part of the night to be alone.  And <br/>\nif our son wets our bed- big deal.  We do an extra load of laundry <br/>\nin the morning.  It doesn&#39;t bother us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Some children would nurse forever I guess. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a dangerous and wrong assumption, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatti</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8151304,"authorName":"rubyprincesstsg@aol.com","from":"rubyprincesstsg@...","profile":"rubyprincesstsg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: thumb sucking?/ending breastfeeding","postDate":"1055949277","msgId":74732,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExZS4yMmQ1ZWExYi4yYzIxZGJkZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":74736,"prevInTime":74731,"nextInTime":74733,"topicId":74732,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/18/2003 9:27:40 AM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

In almost 25 years there have been less than a <br/>\nhandful of &quot;serious&quot; talks with the man.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s been married over forty years.  For the last 19 years he&#39;s shared his <br/>\nmarriage bed with one grandchild or the other that my MIL talked her daughters <br/>\ninto giving to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s never said a word about this and I always thought he WANTED it this way <br/>\nand accepted it as their life together.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wishes he HAD said something at some point.  He sleeps in a small bed in <br/>\nthe same room with his wife and grandson.  The grandson wets the bed and sleeps <br/>\nwith his hands between MIL legs.  He doesn&#39;t like that, so he sleeps in the <br/>\nbed he bought for the grandson.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe feels cheated, he feels neglected, he feels less than and loved less for <br/>\nall these years.  Now, these are not his flesh and blood children, but they are <br/>\nhis flesh and blood grandchildren and now his legally adopted children.  He <br/>\nloves them beyond words but he also loves his wife and wants a relationship <br/>\nwith her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen his own children were young he said that he understood that the children <br/>\ncame first and they both worked hard at the common goal of being parents but <br/>\nat night they were able to come together and share space of their own.  A <br/>\nspace that wasn&#39;t consumed with children.  They could reach out and touch each <br/>\nother in the night and he even said that sex was not the main goal of his <br/>\nrelationship with MIL but it would be nice on occasion.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is thinking of moving away to their vacation house.  He said he will miss <br/>\nthem terribly but now that he&#39;s retired he just can&#39;t be there and not be a <br/>\n&quot;part&quot; of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say that my MIL caters to the children 24 hours a day.  Indulges them <br/>\nwhenever and with whatever they want.  The two kids there are homeschooled, <br/>\nwell one is done but the other homeschools and she takes this raising children <br/>\nthing seriously.  Not like the mothers here do.  More in the line of what <br/>\nSandra sometimes describes.  Really intent on making them think the world stops <br/>\noutside their doorway and keeping them believing that she is the world to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if your husband ever feels this way or not.  No one could have <br/>\ntold me my FIL wasn&#39;t thrilled with his life but now that he&#39;s spoken the words <br/>\nto me, I can see where he must have felt left out and unimportant at times.  <br/>\nI would think it very hard to give up your marital bed for almost twenty years <br/>\nas well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I spend a lot of time with my children, I do more for them than <br/>\nfor my DH and it&#39;s opened my eyes to make some of the extra effort that I go to <br/>\nwith my children spill over onto DH.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end I&#39;d say that you as the mother have a right to your own body and <br/>\nthat your feelings are just as valid as your child&#39;s.  If it has become too <br/>\nmuch for you, then only you can make the decision to stop nursing.  I&#39;m sure <br/>\nthere are other ways you can comfort your child that will be just as meaningful to <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI nursed all of my children, until they decided to stop but none really had <br/>\nmuch interest much over a year old.  There was too much too do and see and they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to sit still too long for nursing, except at bedtime for a minute <br/>\nor two and that even stopped before the age of two.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome children would nurse forever I guess.  My nephew was six or so when he <br/>\nwould still walk up to my sister sitting in a chair, unbutton her place, lift <br/>\nout the breast and bend down and nurse sometimes he would just stand there and <br/>\nfondle the breast then go back out and play.  I will say it caused a lot of <br/>\ncontroversy but she didn&#39;t mind at all.  I&#39;m not sure when he stopped breast <br/>\nfeeding or even if he has yet, he&#39;s going to be eight in Feb.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess it really is up to the mother and child to decide what works best <br/>\nfor both of them, not just one or the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thoughts are with you as you figure this out.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74873,"nextTopicId":74731}}
