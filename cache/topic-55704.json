I remember my 11th grade English teacher ruining many a good <br/>\nbook. Everything we read had a God/Jesus symbolism in it whether it did or <br/>\nnot. All those horrible papers in which we had to talk about symbolism that I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t agree with. I sure could make it up though. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Huck Finn was one of the books. The kids and I recently listened to it on <br/>\ntape. What a fun book. I didn&#39;t remember most of it because it had been <br/>\nruined for me. I&#39;m glad my kids got to enjoy it without having to dissect it <br/>\nor write a paper. The tape even started off with a warning not to try to find <br/>\nthe symbolism in the book but to just enjoy it. Why didn&#39;t/don&#39;t all those <br/>\nteachers listen? My kids had a ball listening to Huck&#39;s adventures. We had <br/>\ndiscussions, but they were natural not forced.<br/>\n<br/>\n    It took me thirty years, but it&#39;s fun to read or listen to those books <br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Ginny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55617,"nextTopicId":55695}}
