They&#39;re 13, 15 and 18 now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is Keith.  He used to do a lot of holding the baby, when there was <br/>\na baby, and many times a baby or toddler fell asleep on dad, and then was put <br/>\nin the bed.  I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s an unschooling thing, but I also don&#39;t <br/>\nknow where unschooling ends, and I think it&#39;s gloriously useful if the <br/>\nchildren trust dad to be as safe and reliable as mom.

Some days he gets quite involved with one or <br/>\nanother, or two, and spends a couple of hours involved.  He and Holly do Celtic <br/>\nknotwork together and talk about that, or he&#39;ll show her something he&#39;s <br/>\nplanning on wood, or she&#39;ll show him something she&#39;s discovered on graph paper.   He <br/>\nand Marty like the same kinds of movies, and they watch the dollar movie <br/>\nschedule to go together.   Keith&#39;s having a heavy SCA involvement (medieval combat <br/>\nstuff, and music, for his part) but I haven&#39;t been going lately, and though <br/>\nboth the boys have been involved in the combat some, neither is very into it in <br/>\nthe past year, so they&#39;re missing a potential opportunity, but everyone&#39;s <br/>\ncalm about it.  I kinda wish the boys were more into it, but I don&#39;t want to <br/>\npressure them because everyone&#39;s happy these days.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-How do you discover what your kids are good at?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nJust by giving them all kinds of opportunities to catch interests or to try <br/>\nthings.  And when one does perk up about one thing or another, don&#39;t peg them <br/>\nwith it and press it.  They might have a big interest in dinosaurs or airplanes <br/>\nor horses that plays itself out someday.  They&#39;ll reach satisfied saturation <br/>\nand go on to other things.  A kid who LOVES playground equipment might have no <br/>\ninterest in gymnastics.  And sometimes a kid&#39;s favorite activity might be one <br/>\nhe&#39;s not noticeably &quot;good at,&quot; but enjoys anyway.  Singing, drawing, <br/>\npuzzles... some do those things who aren&#39;t loaded with talent, but they like it anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nHoward Gardner lists different intelligences (you could google for details) <br/>\nin these areas:<br/>\nkinesthetic<br/>\nmusical<br/>\nverbal<br/>\nspatial<br/>\nlogic<br/>\ninterpersonal<br/>\nintrapersonal<br/>\nnature<br/>\n<br/>\nI left one out, I think.

Sometimes he&#39;s with our kid at work,  too!  <br/>\n <br/>\nDads should do the same things with their kids as the moms do.  Like  <br/>\nchanging diapers and refilling the sippy cups and folding the towels.  And  then dads <br/>\nshould do the things with their kids that dads do, like  &quot;wrestle-fighting&quot; <br/>\nand changing the oil in the van and watching a football  game.  Just like when <br/>\nmom weeds the flower bed, drives them all to  the park, or cleans out the car.<br/>\n <br/>\nLive in relationship with your kids.  Forge your own relationship with  them <br/>\nthat is not dependent on or filtered through mom.  Don&#39;t ask her  permission <br/>\nto hold the toddler against the ceiling over your head.  Be  fun, have fun, do <br/>\nwhat they like, do what you like, point out stuff they didn&#39;t  know about <br/>\nsomething that interests them.  Shut up about things that  don&#39;t.  Be your <br/>\nauthentic self.  Let them get to know you.  Tell  them about the time in high school <br/>\nyou rolled a giant rock in front of the  school door.  Tell them about the <br/>\nfight you had with your brother over a  game of Monopoly.  Let them help you <br/>\nwrite the check to the gas  company.<br/>\n <br/>\nSpeak up for your wife when she&#39;s not being heard.  Ask her what she  would <br/>\nlike for you to do.  Do things without being asked.  See the  dirty sock that&#39;s <br/>\nbeen in the corner for 3 days, and pick it up.  Do  the dishes.  Don&#39;t expect <br/>\ngratitude for it.  Get the grocery shopping  done.  Buy her favorite brands <br/>\nand go by the list.  Help your  kids show gratitude for what she does.  Don&#39;t <br/>\nbe mean to them.<br/>\n <br/>\nTrust your kids to know what they want to do even if they&#39;re not good at  it. <br/>\n Let them try new things even if it&#39;s hard for them and they will never  be <br/>\ngood at it.  Figure out why you think it&#39;s important to you for them to  be <br/>\ngood at something.  Recognize that they&#39;re good at being  themselves.  Don&#39;t put <br/>\nunjust expectations onto them.  Follow them  along and strew interesting <br/>\nthings.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou sound like a good dad.  Trust yourself.

Sometimes just to talk and watch what they are<br/>\ndoing. In the evening he gets the 3 younger ones ready for bed by taking<br/>\ncare of the showers and snacks for them.

His verbal defence in public means<br/>\na lot to me. He&#39;s also very confident about the decisions I make concerning<br/>\nthe children on a daily basis. He trusts my decisions and supports me 100%.<br/>\nHe also calls me on some things like me having a frustration day and not<br/>\nbeing so joyful. I appreciate that and he&#39;ll come and take over and let my<br/>\n&quot;moment&quot; pass without taking it out on the kids.
