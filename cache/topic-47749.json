Are<br/>\n&gt; these kids her same age? I know my Alyssa (2) doesn&#39;t like to play with 2<br/>\n&gt; year old stuff and does much better with older kids.

Tim has always enjoyed playing with older<br/>\nkids who were willing to include him, and really enjoys littler children,<br/>\nbut the fastest way to start a fight was to put him in with other kids his<br/>\nown age.  It was true at 2, and 3, and 4.  These days he chooses to play<br/>\nwith kids of different ages than himself, but he doesn&#39;t fight with the<br/>\nother 6 year olds, he just avoids them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if this might be the entire root of the problem with age-grouping.<br/>\nOlder children are able to be kind to younger ones, and then the little ones<br/>\ngo off and enjoy being the &quot;big kids&quot; to even littler ones for a change, but<br/>\nthere&#39;s just something psycologically wrong with being with all kids the<br/>\nsame age.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm.
