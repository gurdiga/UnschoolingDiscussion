How did each get its<br/>\nname? And are there any other countries named the same as animals or food?<br/>\nIs there a place named Chicken? --Aron Siegel<br/>\n<br/>\nSDSTAFF bibliophage replies:<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s all I know for sure: Despite several crackpot theories to the<br/>\ncontrary, the bird was named after the country, but in a very roundabout way<br/>\nso that the details are uncertain. Oh, one other thing I know for sure: No<br/>\nEuropean should ever have been allowed to name any New World species. The<br/>\nAztecs, who kept domesticated turkeys for hundreds of years before the<br/>\nEuropeans arrived, had a perfectly good word for the bird in their Nahuatl<br/>\nlanguage: xuehxolotl, which, of course, is pronounced. Don&#39;t ask me how it&#39;s<br/>\npronounced, but I&#39;m sure it can be done. If the Europeans had been smart<br/>\nenough to stick with the original name, there would have been no need for me<br/>\nto write this Staff Report, and on Thanksgiving we&#39;d sit down to &quot;xuehxolotl<br/>\nwith all the trimmings.&quot;  Oh, the things that might have been.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst let&#39;s talk about the country. Turkey was named for the Turks, believe<br/>\nit or not. Turk can mean either &quot;a citizen of the modern state of Turkey&quot; or<br/>\nmore broadly, &quot;an individual of the Turkic-speaking people.&quot; The many Turkic<br/>\nlanguages are spoken not only in Turkey but also in a large area of central<br/>\nAsia and in northern Siberia. The real question is the origin of the name<br/>\nTurk. The word is essentially the same in many languages, including English,<br/>\nTurkish, Arabic, and Persian (Farsi). It probably comes from some Turkish<br/>\nroot, but there&#39;s no consensus on which one. It may be one root meaning<br/>\n&quot;strong&quot; or &quot;vigorous&quot; (according to the American Heritage Dictionary) or it<br/>\nmay be another meaning &quot;the people&quot; (according to the Encyclopedia<br/>\nAmericana). <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple of other theories of how the country got its name, both<br/>\nwrong. The first has it that the country was named after the first leader of<br/>\nthe Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. But like most Turks, Mustafa<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have any surname at all until 1934, when he chose Atatürk (&quot;Father of<br/>\nthe Turks&quot;) for himself. He had already given the country its<br/>\nwestern-influenced name Türkiye several years earlier. During the period of<br/>\nthe empire, the Turkish name for the country had nothing to do with the<br/>\nTurks. Rather, it was named for the Osman (Ottoman) dynasty that ruled it.<br/>\nAnother theory has it that the English named the country after the bird, as<br/>\na taunt. But the country was already called &quot;Turki&quot; or &quot;Turkeye&quot; in English<br/>\nby 1275, hundreds of years before the bird was known in the Old World.<br/>\nNow I&#39;ll give you the bird. It&#39;s likely the first bird called &quot;turkey&quot; in<br/>\nEnglish wasn&#39;t the familiar Thanksgiving fowl (Meleagris gallopavo), but a<br/>\nsmaller domesticated bird originally from sub-Saharan Africa: (Numida<br/>\nmeleagris), which we now call the Guinea fowl. This bird was introduced to<br/>\nthe Mediterranean in ancient times and was known (as a rarity) to the Greeks<br/>\nand Romans. It was named after the mythical Meliagrides, who were the<br/>\nsisters of Meleager and who were turned to birds after his death. This bird<br/>\nseems to have disappeared from Europe and was reintroduced from west Africa<br/>\nby Portuguese traders at the end of the fifteenth century. If this bird was<br/>\nfrom Africa, why was it called &quot;turkey&quot; in English? Probably because it was<br/>\nintroduced to England by so-called &quot;Turkey merchants&quot; who traded with the<br/>\nMediterranean region, including the Ottoman Empire (which then controlled<br/>\nthe eastern third of that sea). A similar confusion caused another New World<br/>\nspecies, maize or corn (Zea mays), to be called &quot;Turkey wheat&quot; or &quot;Turkey<br/>\ncorn&quot; in England.<br/>\n<br/>\nM. gallopavo was introduced to Spain from America sometime between 1498 and<br/>\n1526 (but most likely before 1511), and thence to England sometime between<br/>\n1520 and 1541 (but probably before 1530). It too was named &quot;turkey&quot; in<br/>\nEnglish, perhaps because it was confused with N. meleagris, or because it<br/>\nwas likewise introduced by Turkey merchants. In citations from the Oxford<br/>\nEnglish Dictionary, &quot;turkey&quot; dates from 1541, but it is unclear which<br/>\nspecies is meant. Among unambiguous citations, the N. meleagris meaning of<br/>\n&quot;turkey&quot; beats out the M. gallopavo meaning by only three years (1552 vs.<br/>\n1555). The OED doesn&#39;t say so but according to Schorger, the word has also<br/>\nbeen used to describe other birds the males of which use tail displays, such<br/>\nas the peacock. It is even possible that &quot;peacock&quot; was the original meaning<br/>\nof the word in English, but that seems unlikely. For the same reason, the<br/>\ncapercaillie (a kind of grouse) has sometimes been called a peacock (pavo)<br/>\nin Latin as well as &quot;turkey&quot; in English.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other theories of how the bird got its name. John Smith (of<br/>\nPocahontas fame) is sometimes given credit for naming the birds he saw in<br/>\nVirginia &quot;turkey,&quot; having confused them with the Guinea fowl. But as we have<br/>\nalready seen, both birds were established in England decades before Smith<br/>\nwas born in 1580. Another story is that the bird was named after its<br/>\ncaruncle (wattle), which is sometimes blue, the color of Turkey stone<br/>\n(turquoise). Okay, but just because you like &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmean you have to grasp at straws trying to explain the name.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother story is that Christopher Columbus named it tuka, after the Tamil<br/>\nword for &quot;peacock.&quot; (He may or may not have been the first European to see a<br/>\nreal turkey; the credit sometimes goes to Pedro Alonso Niño or Vincente<br/>\nYáñez Pinzón, but it&#39;s less certain that the birds they saw in earlier years<br/>\nwere really turkeys). It&#39;s hard to imagine why Chris would choose a Tamil<br/>\nword when Spanish already had a perfectly suitable word for the domesticated<br/>\npeacock, which was not at all uncommon in Europe at that time. But in fact<br/>\nhe named the bird he saw in Honduras in 1502 not tuka, but rather gallina de<br/>\nla tierra (&quot;ground chicken&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the peacock theory isn&#39;t entirely fantasy. In the early days, there were<br/>\ndozens of different names for the turkey in Spanish, but the one that<br/>\nfinally caught on was pavo, which originally did refer to the peacock. To<br/>\ndifferentiate it from the turkey, the peacock is now called pavo real in<br/>\nSpanish (which could be translated &quot;royal turkey,&quot; and coincidentally this<br/>\nis exactly what I call mybrother-in-law). The two birds may not look very<br/>\nmuch alike to us, but the association isn&#39;t completely unfounded:<br/>\n<br/>\n*    They act the same. The males of both the peafowl and the turkey spread<br/>\ntheir tail feathers in mating displays, though the turkey&#39;s display is much<br/>\nless impressive.<br/>\n*    They sound the same. Both of them have unpleasant calls, a fact noted<br/>\nby the writer Motolinía who visited Mexico in the sixteenth century.<br/>\n*    They taste the same according to at least three early reports,<br/>\nincluding that of Columbus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, there is a related species found in Central America, the<br/>\nocellated turkey (Meleagris ocellata, also called Agriocharis ocellata),<br/>\nwhich resembles a peacock in having eye spots on its tail feathers. It may<br/>\nhave been this bird that the earliest Spanish explorers saw, or it may have<br/>\nbeen any of several other birds of the region that have been confused with<br/>\nthe peacock. This confusion is a big part of the uncertainty of exactly when<br/>\nM. gallopavo was introduced to Spain.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnglish is not the only language that incorrectly associates the turkey with<br/>\nTurkey. Welsh borrowed the English usage and calls the bird twrki. But it is<br/>\ninteresting that many other languages incorrectly associate the bird with<br/>\nother countries. In many languages (including Turkish and French), the bird<br/>\nis called by names indicating it&#39;s from India. This may derive from the<br/>\nconfusion between the East Indies and West Indies that was rampant in those<br/>\ndays. In fact, one of the early Spanish names, gallina de las Indias, means<br/>\n&quot;hen of the Indies.&quot; But other languages (such as Dutch and Danish) are<br/>\nstrangely specific in calling the bird by names indicating the bird is from<br/>\nthe Indian city of Calicut. At that time, Calicut was the most important<br/>\ncity for the trade between Europe and India. So it would not have been<br/>\nunreasonable for Western Europeans to assume that anything exotic came from<br/>\nCalicut, or more generally, from India. Incidentally, &quot;calico cloth&quot; is also<br/>\nnamed after Calicut.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Portuguese, the bird is called peru, despite the fact that the bird was<br/>\nnot introduced to Peru until after the Spanish conquest. The most reasonable<br/>\nexplanation for the association is that the bird became popular in Portugal<br/>\nshortly after Pizarro conquered Peru in 1532, and the Portuguese made a<br/>\nnatural assumption. In Brazilian slang, peru can also means &quot;penis,&quot; which<br/>\nmust make life interesting along the Brazil-Peru border. One word for the<br/>\nbird in one of the several dialects of Hindi is also peru or piru, which is<br/>\nprobably borrowed from Portuguese. That makes sense, since the turkey was<br/>\nintroduced to India by the Portuguese (sometime before 1612). Another<br/>\nsuggestion, discounted by Portuguese etymologists, is that Portuguese and<br/>\nHindi both borrowed the word from a Tamil source. Tamil again? It&#39;s hard to<br/>\nunderstand the fascination Tamil holds for the inventors of false<br/>\netymologies. Maybe they figure most of us can&#39;t speak it and so will believe<br/>\nalmost anything about it. In case you were wondering, in Tamil the bird is<br/>\ncalled by names meaning &quot;sky chicken&quot; or &quot;foreign chicken,&quot; but neither name<br/>\nlooks anything like tuka or peru.<br/>\n<br/>\nLest you think the scientific name of the turkey makes more sense than the<br/>\ncommon ones, it is my duty to inform you that it is perhaps even more messed<br/>\nup. Meleagris gallopavo is composed of the names of three different birds,<br/>\nnone of them the turkey. Meleagris was the ancient Greek name of the Guinea<br/>\nfowl (mentioned above). For hundreds of years, European naturalists believed<br/>\nthe turkey was a kind of Guinea fowl, for reasons that are not entirely<br/>\nclear. Gallopavo was one of the early Spanish names for the turkey (often<br/>\nspelled gallipavo). Gallo- comes from gallus, the Latin word for the common<br/>\nbarnyard fowl (chicken), Gallus domesticus. And -pavo comes from Latin word<br/>\nfor the blue peacock, whose scientific name is Pavo cristatus. The Spanish<br/>\napparently gave it that name because the bird combined several traits of the<br/>\ntwo birds. Some later naturalists took the name too literally and assumed<br/>\nthe turkey was a hybrid of a peacock and a chicken or of a rooster and a<br/>\npeahen. <br/>\n<br/>\nOther foods that share names with countries? Well, there&#39;s chili or chile<br/>\n(as in pepper) but it&#39;s not etymologically related to the name of the<br/>\ncountry Chile. Guinea is an obsolete shortened form of the edible &quot;Guinea<br/>\nfowl&quot; (mentioned above). And from the Brazil nut tree (named after the<br/>\ncountry) we get brazils (or Brazil nuts).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ll accept geographical features smaller than nations, you can make a<br/>\nwhole meal out of places. You could have a Bologna and Cheddar Sandwich with<br/>\nDijon, and a cup of Java to wash it down. You could even serve it on fine<br/>\nChina. And since you asked, there is a place called Chicken, Alaska (pop.<br/>\n17). There&#39;s also an airport in California called Chicken Strip. No word on<br/>\nwhether it&#39;s tender, juicy, and golden-brown. I could continue in the same<br/>\nsilly vein, but that would be beneath the dignity of the Straight Dope. I&#39;m<br/>\nnot Ghana do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAw, who am I kidding?<br/>\n<br/>\nOman, all this talk of food is making me Hungary. Iran over as soon as I<br/>\nsmelled your cooking. Jamaica nuff for me? Why, yes, I would like some<br/>\ncoffee. Just one Cuba sugar, though. You&#39;re out of cream? Why don&#39;t you just<br/>\nmilk Macao to get Samoa? Bring me some booze instead. Lots of it, because I<br/>\nreally want to Taiwan on. This is what you call food? It&#39;s nothing but<br/>\nGreece.

Abby<br/>\ntells me when they got home:  &quot;Mom,  they had a dead turkey and they said<br/>\nthey were cleaning it and going to eat it!&quot;  Then she remarked that she<br/>\nfound watching this and thinking about it to be &quot;totally disgusting&quot;  She<br/>\nsaid she missed the plucking, but saw the cut off head,  watched it being<br/>\nskinned, etc.  Katy also said later that it was disgusting to her, too.  She<br/>\ntoys with the vegetarian idea lately,  but this didn&#39;t seem to push her one<br/>\nway or the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt led to much lively discussion about where our food comes from and how it<br/>\nis processed.  I told her that our relatively new neighbor had raised<br/>\nchickens at her previous home and that their grandmother (my mom) had LOTS<br/>\nof chickens as a child.  We also talked about visiting the Turkey farm near<br/>\nus.....though they said they&#39;d have to think about it after this experience!<br/>\nAnyhow,  a few days before that Abby had asked about where bubble gum comes<br/>\nfrom and how it&#39;s made.  During our library trek we had found a good book on<br/>\nthat PLUS one on peanut butter and chocolate and their origins and<br/>\nproduction.  AND there was a book we borrowed called (something like)<br/>\nDisgusting things people eat ..throughout the world and throughout history.<br/>\nSo we talked abouth the relativity of being disgusted, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a small glimpse of our recent unschooling life.<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;carolyn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nielsonc@...\">nielsonc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 23, 2002 1:06 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] meat was math experience<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I agree that if what you are eating bothers you, you shouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For all of my meat-eating years, however, I preferred not to use or hear<br/>\n&gt; distasteful words about my meal.
