But <br/>\n </span></blockquote>there&#39;s <br/>\nnot enough money in the world to get me to lie to kids and say &quot;You can&#39;t <br/>\nhave this because it&#39;s bad for you&quot; if I don&#39;t believe it.  There&#39;s not <br/>\nenough money to get me to control other people&#39;s kids arbitrarily just <br/>\nbecause the parents would like to do it but they want to go and do something <br/>\nelse for a while.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis resonates for me because one of the hardest struggles I have had since <br/>\nbeginning homeschooling has been the sheer number of Homeschooling (not <br/>\nunschooling) families who do it BECAUSE they want that control.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t want my child exposed to THAT book.&quot; &quot;My child must do THIS math, <br/>\nlearn these Bible verses, and do these jobs before he can play.&quot; &quot;I took my <br/>\nchild out of school because I didn&#39;t want him to be exposed to THOSE kinds of <br/>\npeople.&quot;   (As a lesbian family, I think we&#39;re THOSE kinds of people.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m fascinated by the parents who say that the only one who should have any <br/>\nsay about their kids is the parents, because they belong to me. Children are <br/>\noften referred to as if they were objects. This seems to be true (in my <br/>\nexperience) of Fundamentalist Christian Homeschoolers, especially.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son does not belong to me, except in that we belong to each other out of <br/>\nlove.  There are certainly times when I have made decisions for him based on <br/>\nsafety, and there are people I would not leave him with because it would not <br/>\nbe safe, emotionally or physically.  I trust Julian to make good decisions. <br/>\n(Unfortunately, there are others in world who we cannot trust. When Julian <br/>\nwas little I fought to keep his otherwise excellent father from allowing his <br/>\nmother unsupervised time with Julian, because she had a history of physically <br/>\nabusing her children.) <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not believe our children belong to us. I believe it&#39;s wrong to control <br/>\nthem for our own reasons.  We have many more responsibilities to them than <br/>\nthey have to us. In a right relationship, our children will treat us with <br/>\nlove and respect (because that is what they have learned and experienced), <br/>\nbut I don&#39;t believe they OWE us anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28108,"nextTopicId":28312}}
