Catholic schools started yesterday, but my <br/>\nneighbors drive instead of walking, so it&#39;s less of a spectacle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realized this would have been Nathan&#39;s first day of school - he turned five <br/>\na few weeks ago, before the birthday cutoff.  He would have been one of the <br/>\nyoungest in his class.  Most of his friends were born after the cutoff.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also would have had to get up early, eat breakfast right away instead of <br/>\nan hour into his day when he gets hungry, gotten out of his pjs before <br/>\nbreakfast and then gone to sit in a classroom for an hour.  When would he have had <br/>\ntime to draw and cut out the unicorn he decided to make this morning while I made <br/>\nmuffins?  How would he have learned to make four legs and struggled with the <br/>\nproportions of a side view of a unicorn?  When would he have played with his <br/>\ngears set and talked to me a mile a minute about the wind tunnel he played in <br/>\nat the children&#39;s museum yesterday?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my just turned four year old daughter would have had to have her sleep <br/>\ndisrupted to accompany us to the grade school.  She slept until 9.  They sleep <br/>\nwhen they are tired and eat when they are hungry.  How can you change that <br/>\nmidstream?  It would have been an ugly morning of rushing, dressing, indigestion, <br/>\nanxiety and probably a good dose of yelling.  And what about when the baby <br/>\ncomes in January?  What if he&#39;s nursing when it&#39;s time to leave for school?  How <br/>\nin the world to people cope with this nonsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd these are only the scheduling concerns, not the mind controlling, <br/>\nbehavior modification concerns I have about school in general.  They don&#39;t know they <br/>\naren&#39;t supposed to learn about the orbits of the earth, sun and moon until the <br/>\nsecond or third grade!
