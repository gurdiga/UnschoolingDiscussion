And <br/>\nthen <br/>\njust keep doing that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the same type of thing I tell people who ask<br/>\nme how I clean house.  I clean for people who seem<br/>\nlike they should really know stuff (doctors and<br/>\nlawyers)  and they have no clue that the best way to<br/>\navoid bugs is to put dirty dishes in the dishwasher<br/>\ninstead of leaving it on the floor or table.  They<br/>\njust put stuff where ever it is convenient and never<br/>\nput anything away.   One house I clean once a week  is<br/>\nclean when I leave it  and the next week I can barely<br/>\nwalk thru the house because there is so much stuff on<br/>\nthe floor.   The lady who owns the house asked me how<br/>\nI get the house so clean,  and I told her that I just<br/>\nput everything back where it goes  and she acted like<br/>\nI told her some huge secret.  I say &quot;a place for<br/>\neverything and everything in its place&quot;  I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember where I heard this  but it is the way I try<br/>\nto keep my space and it seems to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

It doesn&#39;t seem like <br/>\n&quot;cleaning&quot; is that big a deal. I remember someone going on and on once, back <br/>\non the aol message boards, about making sure her children know the RIGHT way <br/>\nto load the washing machine (not the dishwasher, the clothes washer). I mean- <br/>\nokay, don&#39;t stuff it too tight with clothes, don&#39;t put new colored stuff in <br/>\nwith other things -- that&#39;s about it. It&#39;s all just common sense stuff, isn&#39;t <br/>\nit?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is clutter that overwhelms me - I don&#39;t understand how to keep it under <br/>\ncontrol.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I had a housekeeper once (back in my previous life &lt;G&gt; when I was a <br/>\ncorporate economist). She was a woman much older than myself. I asked her <br/>\nwhat I should do to keep my house more tidy. She said, absolutely seriously, <br/>\n&quot;Pick up one thing and put it away. Then do the same with another. And then <br/>\njust keep doing that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38474,"nextTopicId":38488}}
