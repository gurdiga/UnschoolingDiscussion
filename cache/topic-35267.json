Some have a list of courses that the underage student is not<br/>\n&gt; allowed to enroll in -- human sexuality courses, for example. Some will<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; allow underage students to take &quot;remedial&quot; courses - courses that they<br/>\ncould<br/>\n&gt; take at a high school, for example. Some will not allow courses that they<br/>\n&gt; consider vocational - courses such as guitar, that could be taken<br/>\nelsewhere,<br/>\n&gt; at a city recreation department, for example.
