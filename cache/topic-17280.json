I really appreciate it! <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot to process in what you all said. I&#39;ll<br/>\nhave to read it a couple times. :) To answer some<br/>\nquestions, I don&#39;t know why I consider sci-fi trash.<br/>\nProbably my English major background.;) Someone said<br/>\nif I limit what he reads it could stifle his love of<br/>\nreading. Thanks for that. I need to keep that in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t *have* them do stuff like build models. But I<br/>\n*will* grab a book from the library about Egypt<br/>\nactivities since they&#39;re into that Pharoah game, and<br/>\nleave it lying around enticingly. Then they come to me<br/>\nand say can we build this river delta?  Now I&#39;m<br/>\nthinking I could leave some space activity stuff<br/>\naround and soon they&#39;ll be building spaceships. :) I<br/>\ndo want to encourage the interest in science that<br/>\nleads to wanting to read sci-fi. Luckily, I haven&#39;t<br/>\n*sneered* at the sci-fi books. So I don&#39;t think he<br/>\nsenses disapproval. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone asked about why I&#39;m worried about the scary<br/>\nparts if I know he&#39;ll stop reading. Well, that&#39;s<br/>\nbecause of my kids&#39; sensitivity. My dd, for example,<br/>\nloves marine animals, and she got a National<br/>\nGeographic shark video, which had a graphic, bloody<br/>\nattack scene at the very beginning. Of course she<br/>\nstopped watching, but still, it was enough to have her<br/>\nafraid to go in the ocean when we visited Texas, to<br/>\nhave her need to sleep with me for weeks, to have her<br/>\nnot want to read *any* marine animal books or watch<br/>\n*any* movies that might have anything popl out at her<br/>\nagain. I guess I was worried that adult sci-fi would<br/>\nhave some sort of effect like that on my son. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks again, SO MUCH, for all the advice.<br/>\nJuli<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
