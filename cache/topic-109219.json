(Can<br/>\nyou imagine if failing students were a misdemeanor for teachers?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are plenty of people out there who would love to place a<br/>\ninordinate number of requirements and state-oversight on homeschoolers<br/>\n(these are generally the same people who have the most difficult time<br/>\nunderstanding unschooling).  These same people are hardly satisfied<br/>\nwith the homeschooling laws in states like PA, and are horrified that<br/>\nany state (like ID) would allow parents to opt out of state oversight<br/>\nand education entirely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThose homeschoolers who choose to be &quot;truant&quot; rather than comply with<br/>\nstate law fan the flames of those (ironically, public schoolers) who<br/>\nwould like to see homeschooling banned entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn (WA, specifically), compliance is very simple, very basic, and very<br/>\nnon-intrusive.  (There is no mechanism, for example, except entry or<br/>\nreenrty to the school system, that allows for the state to check the<br/>\nassessments or tests.  The scores are completely between the testing<br/>\nfolks and the family).  &quot;[A]ll decisions relating to philosophy or<br/>\ndoctrine, selections of books, teaching materials and curriculum, and<br/>\nmethods, timing, and place in the provision or evaluation of<br/>\nhome-based instruction shall be the responsibility of the parent&quot; in WA.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Sue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; -=-Non-compliance with state law risks both the children being<br/>\n </span></blockquote>placed in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; public school, and the children being placed in foster care.
