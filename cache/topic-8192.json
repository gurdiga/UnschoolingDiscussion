His radical position is that children\nautomatically know how and what to learn, that they&#39;re born with the knowledge\nof how to get nonsense.&nbsp; The proper methods of developing one&#39;s own\nintellect have to be learned just like any other knowledge, and having\na teacher to guide the process is of significant value. (See Objective\nApproach.) A parent who insists that a child must lead his own education\nplaces an undue burden upon his young shoulders. Children do not yet have\na broad enough context to see how knowledge fits together; they dont mysteriously\n&quot;know&quot; what they can&#39;t possibly know.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hometaught.com/app_unschooling.htm\">http://www.hometaught.com/app_unschooling.htm</a>\n<p>imo:&nbsp; the burden, placed on children, of parents who lack faith\nin a child&#39;s ability and desires is the true burden.&nbsp;&nbsp; and the\nfallacy is that unschooling parent don&#39;t facilitate the &#39;fitting together\nof knowledge&#39;.&nbsp; which leads to the denial that children question the\nworld around them and that these questions led to the experience of &#39;how\nknowledge fits together&#39; and these experiences, if not discovery naturally\nbut the child, are provided and facilitated by the parents.&nbsp; unschooling\nparents and their children choose a lifestyle of learning and thereby don&#39;t\nmake a distinction between life and teaching.\n<p>&nbsp;<i>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Unschooling is:&nbsp; Anti-schooling...</u></i>\n<br><i>John Holts advice to unschooling parents from Teach Your Own (p.\n229) sums up his theory in practice:</i>\n<p><i>&quot;I say, above all else, dont let your home become [a] miniature\ncopy of the school. No lesson plans! No quizzes! No tests! No report cards!\nEven leaving your children alone would be better; at least they could figure\nout some things on their</i>\n<br><i>own. Live together, as well as you can; enjoy life together, as\nmuch as you can.&quot;</i>\n<p><i>In other words, let the child be responsible for his own education.\nYou parents dont have to do anythingdont plan a curriculum, dont try\nto evaluate your childs progress, dont try to teach him. Just leave him\nalone to learn from life.</i>&nbsp; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hometaught.com/john_holt.htm\">http://www.hometaught.com/john_holt.htm</a>\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p>imo: i don&#39;t know how you can &#39;live together&#39; and then &#39;leave your [kids}\nalone&#39;.&nbsp; and the point that life-learners are people who have developed\nthe skills of self-motivation and curiosity is completely lost in this\n&#39;interpretation&#39;.\n<p>overall this author exhibits a need, for whatever reason, to have control\nover her children and their learning process, yet is not secure enough\nin this position to just do it, but must support the position by negating\nthe possibility that there is a way where a child can learn and not be\ncontrolled.&nbsp; imo we as parents need faith in ourselves as well as\nour children and this is perhaps the toughest hurdle presented by unschooling\n- obviously this author was unable to make this &#39;leap of faith&#39; and perhaps\nshould follow a different philosophy.\n<p>-susan,\n<br>austin,tx\n<br>&#39;unity through diversity&#39;\n<p>unschoolr2@... wrote:\n<blockquote TYPE=\"CITE\">Hi all, I am working on an article on the common\nmyths or misconceptions\n<br>about unschooling and unschooling families.

His radical position is that children\nautomatically know how and what to learn, that they&#39;re born with the knowledge\nof how to get nonsense.&nbsp; The proper methods of developing one&#39;s own\nintellect have to be learned just like any other knowledge, and having\na teacher to guide the process is of significant value. (See Objective\nApproach.) A parent who insists that a child must lead his own education\nplaces an undue burden upon his young shoulders. Children do not yet have\na broad enough context to see how knowledge fits together; they dont mysteriously\n&quot;know&quot; what they can&#39;t possibly know.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" HREF=\"http://www.hometaught.com/app_unschooling.htm\">http://www.hometaught.com/app_unschooling.htm</a>\n<p>imo:&nbsp; the burden, placed on children, of parents who lack faith\nin a child&#39;s ability and desires is the true burden.&nbsp;&nbsp; and the\nfallacy is that unschooling parent don&#39;t facilitate the &#39;fitting together\nof knowledge&#39;.&nbsp; which leads to the denial that children question the\nworld around them and that these questions led to the experience of &#39;how\nknowledge fits together&#39; and these experiences, if not discovery naturally\nbut the child, are provided and facilitated by the parents.&nbsp; unschooling\nparents and their children choose a lifestyle of learning and thereby don&#39;t\nmake a distinction between life and teaching.\n<p>&nbsp;<i>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Unschooling is:&nbsp; Anti-schooling...</u></i>\n<br><i>John Holts advice to unschooling parents from Teach Your Own (p.\n229) sums up his theory in practice:</i><i></i>\n<p><i>&quot;I say, above all else, dont let your home become [a] miniature\ncopy of the school. No lesson plans! No quizzes! No tests! No report cards!\nEven leaving your children alone would be better; at least they could figure\nout some things on their</i>\n<br><i>own. Live together, as well as you can; enjoy life together, as\nmuch as you can.&quot;</i><i></i>\n<p><i>In other words, let the child be responsible for his own education.\nYou parents dont have to do anythingdont plan a curriculum, dont try\nto evaluate your childs progress, dont try to teach him. Just leave him\nalone to learn from life.</i>&nbsp; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" HREF=\"http://www.hometaught.com/john_holt.htm\">http://www.hometaught.com/john_holt.htm</a>\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p>imo: i don&#39;t know how you can &#39;live together&#39; and then &#39;leave your [kids}\nalone&#39;.&nbsp; and the point that life-learners are people who have developed\nthe skills of self-motivation and curiosity is completely lost in this\n&#39;interpretation&#39;.\n<p>overall this author exhibits a need, for whatever reason, to have control\nover her children and their learning process, yet is not secure enough\nin this position to just do it, but must support the position by negating\nthe possibility that there is a way where a child can learn and not be\ncontrolled.&nbsp; imo we as parents need faith in ourselves as well as\nour children and this is perhaps the toughest hurdle presented by unschooling\n- obviously this author was unable to make this &#39;leap of faith&#39; and perhaps\nshould follow a different philosophy.\n<p>-susan,\n<br>austin,tx\n<br>&#39;unity through diversity&#39;\n<p>unschoolr2@... wrote:\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote TYPE=\"CITE\">Hi all, I am working on an article on the common\nmyths or misconceptions\n<br>about unschooling and unschooling families.
