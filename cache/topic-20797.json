The premise was that the community is paying for the<br/>\nambulance,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the police officers, the para-medics, the hospital bill, etc.  (yeah,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;right!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am still amazed that so many communities gave over such basic freedoms<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt;force protection.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Eiraul...who fastens her seat belt EVERY time, but occasionally has to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fight<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the rebellion monster...you know, that little demon that says &#39;no one can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;MAKE me do anything!&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s been illegal over here for several years to not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wear a seat belt without an exemption.
