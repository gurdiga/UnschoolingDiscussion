When you get close to them, watch and play with them, you can see the value through their eyes and it becomes valuable to you too, maybe even for your own reasons. The trick is to stop saying even just to yourself, &quot;Well, I can&#39;t see the value in that!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMamabeth wrote:<br/>\nHere&#39;s another thought...what if he goes on from there to design the next big card craze among kids his age...at least those in his neighborhood...from what he&#39;s learned?

I&#39;m not saying it couldn&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t lead to that, just that we shouldn&#39;t have such expectations or even dreams. We need to leave that kind of dreaming to the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we have to let go of the future and really *be* in the here and now. When we start trying to figure out what our children could be doing in the future and how x, y or z is really valuable because it&#39;s leading up to that really valuable, real world thing, we fall back into a conventional paradigm that says the purpose of childhood is to prepare for productive adulthood.  I don&#39;t want a life for my children that says be productive first, live second. I want them to really love and enjoy life, and I have faith that &quot;making a living&quot; will flow from that. I have faith that they will find their own path in this world by following their passion and joy in life.
