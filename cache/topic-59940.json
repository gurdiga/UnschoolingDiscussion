Following this argument,  <br/>\nneither he <br/>\nnor any Regent, legislator, or school board member should hold <br/>\npublic <br/>\noffice <br/>\nwithout first passing five Regents examinations.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, policymakers come to office after demonstrating their <br/>\nabilities in <br/>\nvaried real-life situations.  A paper-and-pencil test will not <br/>\ncapture <br/>\ntheir <br/>\ncapabilities in working creatively, cooperatively, or over time.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust so:  if standardized tests are not a good way to assess the <br/>\nabilities of <br/>\nour leaders, then neither are they a good way to assess students.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStandardized tests steal funds from classrooms while school <br/>\ndistricts <br/>\nstatewide face fiscal crises. A minimal requirement for school board <br/>\n&quot;standards&quot; should be to call on Mills and the Regents for an <br/>\nimmediate <br/>\nend <br/>\nto their simple-minded over-emphasis on standardized testing as a <br/>\nmeasure of <br/>\nquality teaching, learning, or thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n*AP article by Carolyn Thompson, Feb. 24, 2003</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75168,"nextTopicId":74888}}
