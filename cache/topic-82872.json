I can&#39;t <br/>\nimagine anyone living in a residence like this.&quot;<br/>\nTom Lock,<br/>\nJohnston County district attorney<br/>\n<br/>\n(CBS)Â The school bus never stopped at the secluded trailer on <br/>\nHickory Crossroads in rural North Carolina because for five <br/>\nyears Nissa and Kent Warren home schooled their children. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, as CBS News Correspondent Vince Gonzales reports, <br/>\ncounty workers got an anonymous tip: better check on those <br/>\nkids. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This is one of those cases that will always haunt me,&quot; says <br/>\nTom Lock, the Johnston County district attorney. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor weeks, the parents tried to keep social workers out until <br/>\nthe day detectives and Lock were called in. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I was stunned at the squalor that I saw,&quot; says Lock. &quot;There <br/>\nwas rotting food, animal feces on the floor. I can&#39;t imagine <br/>\nanyone living in a residence like this.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nA faded sign on the wall reads: &quot;So this isn&#39;t home sweet home: <br/>\nadjust.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the bedroom, 14-year-old Brandon had committed suicide <br/>\nwith a rifle after killing his brother Kyle and sister Marnie. Their <br/>\nmother discovered the bodies. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;She stopped me in the road (and) said my children are dead,&quot; <br/>\nsays a neighbor. <br/>\n<br/>\nNissa Warren told a detective she&#39;d &quot;rather God had them than <br/>\nChild Protective Services.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIt turned out the Warrens had home schooled before, in <br/>\nArizona, where they were convicted of child abuse. An <br/>\ninvestigator there wrote: &quot;The children are tortured physically <br/>\nand emotionally.&quot; That&#39;s information North Carolina school <br/>\nofficials are not required to collect. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince it became legal in North Carolina in 1985, the number <br/>\nof home school students has jumped from just a few hundred <br/>\nto more than 50,000. But there&#39;s been no change in the number <br/>\nof state employees overseeing the program - just three for the <br/>\nentire state. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think there&#39;s so little supervision that they really are not <br/>\nprotecting those kids,&quot; Marcia Herman-Giddens, of the North <br/>\nCarolina Child Advocacy Institute. <br/>\n<br/>\nHerman-Giddens is on the state task force that reviewed the <br/>\nWarren case. The conclusion: home school laws &quot;allow <br/>\npersons who maltreat children to maintain social isolation <br/>\nin order for the abuse and neglect to remain undetected.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They deliberately keep them out of the public eye because the <br/>\nchildren do have injuries that are visible, and they don&#39;t want <br/>\nthem to be seen,&quot; she says. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut Hal Young, an advocate for home school parents, says <br/>\nmost parents are loving and doing a very good job. He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t see a connection &quot;based on one very tragic <br/>\nunfortunate case.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t see a connection that would say this is where the <br/>\ngovernment needs to step in, this is where the government <br/>\nneeds to come to your home, come into your life,&quot; says Young. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Warrens were acquitted of child abuse charges but spent <br/>\n45 days in jail for failing to secure a firearm. Through their <br/>\nattorney they declined requests for an interview. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;All they ever asked was that they be able to raise their children <br/>\nin the manner in which they felt was appropriate,&quot; their attorney <br/>\nJonathan Breeden said. <br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIn part 2 of Vince Gonzales&#39; report: how children nationwide <br/>\nhave been put in danger, even killed, while home schooling.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82868,"nextTopicId":82829}}
