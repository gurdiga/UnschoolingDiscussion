I attempt to keep things picked up but the heavy-duty cleaning gets neglected often.  We have several pets and the agreement when we got them was that the girls would help out. So, each girl has a job (one is litter duty and the other is feeding & fresh water). They have to do this or watch me go on a rampage, which they care to not experience! All the other stuff... vaccuuming, dishes, etc. we all jump in and just get it done when I rally the troups. Do they grumble about it? yes, but it has to get done.<br/>\nEach kid does her own laundry... lugging it to the basement (I wash  & dry), carrying it back upstairs and folding, etc. <br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30416,"nextTopicId":30450}}
