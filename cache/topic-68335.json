The straw that broke the camels back for me was the teacher telling my Brianna (Abenaki, Mandan-Hidatsu, Mohawk) that she had to be a pilgrim and that I had to make the outfit! Brianna (aka Mudpuppy) came home and said &quot;the teacher wants......... I&#39;m not doing it.&quot;   So she didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was younger - I was told that the Azores (we are also Azorean) - a group of islands approx. 750 miles west of Portugal - were conquered by the Portuguese around the 1200&#39;s. I was told that we - the Calouro&#39;s - could trace our family back to the invasion. I was told stories of what the invaders did on the island ( they found the women beautiful, and able to fish and fight along side the men;  traders were warned about the islands, although the islands were beautiful, they were inhabited by witches and infidels)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if you look up history about the Azores - the islands are described as &quot;uninhabited&quot; when the Portuguese &quot;discovered&quot; them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you know that the current Japanese are not indigenous to those islands??<br/>\nThis seems to be a habit - assassination or assimilation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMudpuppy & I live outside the mainstream - that&#39;s good.  She isn&#39;t so bothered about weight, looks or clothes. She&#39;s concerned with things of the People - which powwow will we go to.  Will her new regalia be ready?  Will her aunt Kelly get well ( fighting cancer) will we ( the council) get the long house and garden done this season? and how much will she do? <br/>\n<br/>\nWe can (and should) look at the culture and - maybe -0 if it&#39;s right for you - take what we want, what we need.<br/>\nBut stay outside of mainstream culture - it is the culture of consumerism, it is the culture of self- destruction - <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you like some books???<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Mamita Mala <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, May 09, 2003 10:43 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Cultural literacy, cultural lies and mainstream society<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess alot of this depends on what one considers &quot;their&quot; culture to be.

Is that a blatant lie?  It&#39;s <br/>\nsymbolic art.  Nobody&#39;s pointing it out to tourists and saying &quot;This is from <br/>\na photograph of the day Washington met Lincoln.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think telling kids there&#39;s a conspiracy and the national symbols and <br/>\nstories are all lies is likewise a lie.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been interested in traditional ballads since I was fifteen.  They&#39;re one <br/>\nof my favorite collectible things.  In literature books they&#39;re sometimes <br/>\nlisted as &quot;anonymous.&quot;  They&#39;re not &quot;anonymous.&quot;  Anonymous means someone <br/>\nwrote it, but forgot to sign it, or sent it out into the world without <br/>\nwanting credit.  There are broadside ballads which are truly anonymous.  <br/>\nSomeone wrote a parody, or the account of a hanging or something (&quot;to be sung <br/>\nto the tune of Greensleeves&quot;), it was published that afternoon to sell at the <br/>\npublic execution site as souvenirs, and it was over that same day.    <br/>\n<br/>\nBut a traditional ballad will be found in different parts and places, with <br/>\nvariations and maybe different tunes, having changed gradually over long <br/>\nperiods of time.  And when you find one it&#39;s not &quot;anonymous,&quot; it&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;traditional.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo are lots of the simplified elements of history which schoolkids recite <br/>\nback, which pass for &quot;learning history.&quot;  They&#39;re learning mythology, and <br/>\ntraditional accounts and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a growing set of lies which ARE composed by particular purposes and <br/>\nthey&#39;re being sold in homeschooling catalogs every day.  That&#39;s the revised <br/>\nhistory of America used by many homeschoolers, the history that shows that <br/>\nAmerica was always a Christian country, corrupted by immigrants and bad <br/>\ninfluences; that the Indians were cannibals, killing each other all the time <br/>\nin their mean igorance; that God chose and maintains this country but he&#39;s <br/>\nvery angry and this country needs to get back to its true roots.  The paint <br/>\nis still wet on those new true roots.  How will kids who are presented that <br/>\nas &quot;this is history, period&quot; know that what they have is a brand new kind of <br/>\nmythology?<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is Christian &quot;science.&quot; Not christian-science as in the church, <br/>\nbut homeschooling science materials written by Christians to match the Bible, <br/>\nand if kids are limited to JUST the input their parents choose, how will they <br/>\nknow there is other more objective, more scientific science out there?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids gather up their own cultural literacy, Rumplestiltskin is a name to <br/>\nknow, and Teddy Roosevelt is a name to know.  One&#39;s more real than the other, <br/>\nbut they&#39;ve both had stories told about them that weren&#39;t true!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":108173680,"authorName":"sorcha_aisling","from":"&quot;sorcha_aisling&quot; &lt;sorcha-aisling@...&gt;","profile":"sorcha_aisling","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Cultural literacy, cultural lies and mainstream society","postDate":"1052509574","msgId":68335,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI5aDBpNitobmdyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":68343,"prevInTime":68334,"nextInTime":68336,"topicId":68335,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is something I ve struggled with ever since I was in third grade and my father told me that the Thanksgiving story they told me in school wasn t true.

Why does our culture lie to children?  And what <br/>\ndo we tell our own children?<br/>\n<br/>\nColumbus didn&#39;t discover America, he didn&#39;t use the word &quot;Indians&quot; <br/>\nbecuase he thought he was in India, and people in Europe in 1492 <br/>\ndidn&#39;t think the world was flat.  But could someone be culturally <br/>\nliterate (mainstream American culture, not multiculturally literate) <br/>\nwithout at least knowing that some people do believe these things?<br/>\n<br/>\nAbraham Lincoln didn&#39;t fight the Civil War to free the slaves and <br/>\ngive them American citizenship, but it&#39;s a cultural myth so big that <br/>\nit clouds any discussion of the Civil War.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do &quot;get&quot; where E.D. Hirsch is coming from, that it helps if people <br/>\nare on the same page when they&#39;re talking.  If I was going to do a <br/>\ncurriculum it would be his.  When someone says, &quot;It&#39;s a modern-day <br/>\nCinderella story&quot; I don&#39;t want my children to say, &quot;What the heck is <br/>\na Cinderella story?&quot;  I hope they don&#39;t respond to a reference that <br/>\nthe Emperor has no clothes by saying that we have a President, not an <br/>\nEmperor.  I don&#39;t think anyone born in this country needs a school to <br/>\nteach them cultural literacy.  But I do wonder what people tell their <br/>\nchildren when the cultural myth is a blatant lie.  What do you say on <br/>\nThanksgiving?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorcha</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68475,"nextTopicId":68445}}
