But these last few days have made <br/>\nme re-evaluate that thought. When I use the old special needs tag I&#39;m <br/>\nthinking of kids with behaviors. Those who are extreme or quirky or <br/>\nsensitive. The kinds who would indeed receive those nebulous alphabet soup <br/>\nlabels in school. What I wan&#39;t considering were those dear kids who have <br/>\nabsolute physical needs that are so different. Kids with seizures or down <br/>\nsyndrome or FAS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still believe in my absolute truth that trusting and understanding these <br/>\nkids is the path to take. I believe that schools and regimentation and <br/>\nabsolutes are harmful to any being&#39;s psyche. But I wonder if I should know <br/>\nmore about these kids physical limitations before I answer so quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen again, I think *my* truth can be shared and fit into each child&#39;s <br/>\npuzzle of a world and used however it will fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, now I&#39;m rambling. ;-) Just thinking out loud.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I do have faith that what I am doing is the right way to help my kids each <br/>\n&gt;&gt;keep and explore their own unique way of being in this world, but it still <br/>\n&gt;&gt;helps to hear from the other end of the age spectrum that yes, this is <br/>\n&gt;&gt;true.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, this  *is* tue. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58848,"nextTopicId":58784}}
