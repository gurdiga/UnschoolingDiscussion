We had three left, so I split one so that we each had one and a half slices. I showed him how it was equal..we both had one big and one little slice, and I explained how the little one was half a slice. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe looks at them and says &quot;I&#39;m like this one&quot; holding up the large slice. &quot;Megan is this one,&quot; he then said while holding up the small one. &quot;Oh, yeah?&quot; I asked. &quot;Yeah. And Jeremiah is a big one, and Gracie-baby is a little one!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWow. Lessons learned with bacon...who&#39;da thunk? <br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything I need to know, I learned on my own!<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFind out what made the Top Yahoo!
