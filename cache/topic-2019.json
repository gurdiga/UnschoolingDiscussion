Don&#39;t we want leaders who see the big picture?<br/>\nDon&#39;t sucessful adults see the big picture?&quot;  But we can&#39;t look at the big<br/>\npicture in 1st grade because we have to concentrate on the letter &quot;A&quot; today!<br/>\nAll 3 of my kids are &quot;whole-to-part-ers&quot;,  although they did do a pretty<br/>\ngood job of drilling it out of my daughter.  Labeled her LD too.  How can a<br/>\nperfectly happy, wonderful, enthusiastic Kindergartener become LD by 1st<br/>\ngrade?

Don&#39;t remember my writing being that bad,<br/>\ndon&#39;t remember the classes, but I am forever grateful for them!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not convinced that everyone can &quot;learn&quot; beautiful handwriting.  Perhaps<br/>\nthat is a talent or a &quot;gift&quot; that someone chose to nurture in you through<br/>\nclasses.  Just like some people are better suited to play the flute and<br/>\nothers the tuba - It&#39;s not to say one couldn&#39;t &quot;learn&quot; to play the flute,<br/>\nbut if the structure of your mouth is suited for the tuba, then that flute<br/>\nwill never sing like it might for someone else.  Since handwriting depends<br/>\non fine motor skills, we will always fall somewhere along a line from<br/>\nbeautiful to awful! with a lot of average in between.<br/>\n<br/>\nRE: Melissa said:<br/>\n&quot;I will say this, though, it drives me crazy to read things<br/>\nfrom people who can&#39;t spell very well (postings on this list excluded, of<br/>\ncourse &lt;g&gt;). I am a big proponent of learning to spell, not necessarily of<br/>\nlearning cursive. My dad (in his late 50&#39;s now and one of the most<br/>\nintelligent guys I know) spells phonetically. No kidding. He is the<br/>\npresident  of a large corporation and writes/speaks fluently but stinks at<br/>\nspelling.  Hmmm.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood spelling is also a talent not all of us have!  My dd became very<br/>\ndependant on her Spelling Ace because she knew people would think she was<br/>\nstupid because she can&#39;t spell worth a hoot!  and her phonics stink too -<br/>\nwhich makes it even worse!  She had 9 years of public school and just<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t get it.  There again, it&#39;s a &quot;Learning Disability&quot;, but I&#39;d much<br/>\nrather she develop her other talents than get bogged down by what she can&#39;t<br/>\ndo. (If it hasn&#39;t improved in 9 years - get over it!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMY CONFESSION:  I must admit, my &quot;thing&quot; is bad grammer!
