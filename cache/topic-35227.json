The methodology <br/>\nused for this estimation was changed in 1994. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think acts of terrorism are collected in a separate database by the Justice <br/>\nDepartment. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince the FBI crime statistics are really intended only to look at reported <br/>\ncrimes, there is another database which complements it by looking at crime <br/>\nfrom the point of view of victims. I believe it is based on surveys which <br/>\nattempt to get a sense of how many unreported crimes there are. This is <br/>\ncalled something like the National Victims of Crime Survey??
