The past couple of months have been hard. I&#39;ve been feeling<br/>\nburnt out and finding myself cleaning up after the kids and not really<br/>\nspending enough time making the messes with them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe discussions about cleaning, rules versus principles, and food have been<br/>\njust what I needed. I think it was Julie. S who posted these wonderful words<br/>\n&quot;you are free to live your life as you see fit as long as you are not<br/>\ncausing harm to others&quot;. Now that&#39;s someting to live by. That&#39;s a lot of<br/>\nfreedom for my kids but not at anyone&#39;s expense.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids and I  have had a wonderful week together. Grocery shopping was<br/>\nactually fun! The kids went to bed all at different times tonight and they<br/>\nwere so happy and peaceful and loving. Mia ( 4 yrs) told me as we were<br/>\nhaving a cuddle, &quot;you are so beautiful Mum, you&#39;re so precious to me&quot; It was<br/>\nreally sweet to hear my words to her given back to me. What a gift!! Jess<br/>\ntold me he loved the way I had cleaned his room and that he had had a great<br/>\nday.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, my husband read a post of Deb&#39;s and one of Ren&#39;s  from Unschooling 101<br/>\nabout housework and unschooling and they really touched  him. He has printed<br/>\nthem out to keep close by. After reading them, he helped me out with some<br/>\nhousework that needed doing while the kids played.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also had heaps of fun cleaning our floors (thanks Lyle!!!). The whole<br/>\nfamily donned thick socks and &quot;skate mopped&quot; the floor. We moved the table<br/>\nand chairs out of the room so we had a huge area to skate around on and we<br/>\nhad a blast. My mother, brother and sister arrived just as we began. 5<br/>\nminutes later Kate was asking for socks and ten minutes after that my mum<br/>\n(60 this year) was zooming around with us! The floor looks fantastic and the<br/>\nkids are looking forward to the time it needs to be cleaned again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89164,"nextTopicId":89141}}
