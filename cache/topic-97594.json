Even the<br/>\nneutral seeming words like &quot;Grading&quot; certainly have a negative component -<br/>\neg the bell curve means someone has to get an &quot;F&quot;, &quot;Solutions&quot; - there must<br/>\nbe a problem for there to be a solution to it.

I was just kind of auditing the list. The above words would<br/>\nbe the subset from the main list that are surely negatively predictive -<br/>\nseen from a schooling context. (I include Special Needs as negative *only*<br/>\nfrom that perspective - something that needs correcting with special<br/>\nattention).<br/>\n<br/>\nNo wonder our lives look so extraordinary (to bring in an idea from another<br/>\nthread) since we focus constantly on strengths and good stuff - as the<br/>\ndifficult to cull list of unschooling words shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking that you are making a presentation to a largely mixed group of<br/>\nhomeschoolers and possible future homeschoolers, with a few Unschoolers<br/>\nthrown in, with a view to showing how great Unschooling can be. How it<br/>\ndiffers both from school and curriculum based homeschooling. Is this right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s interesting to investigate words that are intersecting - the<br/>\nsame word with hugely different meanings in the two contexts. Boredom,<br/>\nExpectations, Experts (whom we tend regard either as service providers,<br/>\nourselves, or with a very jaundiced eye), Learning, Instructions (like for a<br/>\nvideo game?), Limits (a great discussion on U/B recently), Progress, Work<br/>\n(&quot;Play is the work of childhood&quot; - who said that?), Structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to cull the other list:<br/>\n<br/>\nAcceptance  active  appreciation  artistic  attention  authentic  available<br/>\nawareness  beauty  brilliant  caring  challenge  choice  closeness<br/>\ncommunity  companionship  compassion  confidence  connections  contemplation<br/>\nconversation  courage  creative  curiosity  dabbling  easy  empowerment<br/>\nendeavors  energy  engaged  environment  everything  excitement  experience<br/>\nexperimentation  explore  facilitator  family  feelings  figure out  flow<br/>\nfocus  freedom  games  generosity  gentleness genuine  growing-up  growth<br/>\nhands-on  happiness  help  home  honor  ideas  imagination  immersion<br/>\nindependence  individual  information  integrated  interest  joy  kindness<br/>\nknowledge  learning  life  lifestyle  listening  living  love  mastery<br/>\nmodel  natural  needs  notice  nurture  observation  offer  opportunities<br/>\nPassion  pathway  patience  perception  personality  philosophy  places<br/>\nplay  pleasure  preferences  presence  pretend  process  protect  questions<br/>\nQuiet  real life  relationships  resources  responsible  rest  right  safe<br/>\nserious  sharing  siblings  situations  songs  strengths  strew  success<br/>\nSuggestions  support  talk about it  thinking  thought  time  together<br/>\nToys  trust  truth  understanding  unique  validate  value  voluntary<br/>\nWhole  wisdom  wonder  work it out  world  yes<br/>\n<br/>\n(Yes I reformatted it by hand - you can thank me later, or not. ;) )<br/>\n<br/>\nVijay suggested 12. Given the interesting discussion the word &quot;dabbling&quot;<br/>\naroused, maybe not that - OTOH if the aim is to entice people to explore<br/>\nUnschooling further maybe you shouldn&#39;t scare them off with words that are<br/>\ntoo school-negative, even if they are Unschool-positive. Again the idea of<br/>\nlooking at the intersections could be interesting. &quot;Environment&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;Suggestion&quot; and &quot;Immersion&quot; are words that mean something different in<br/>\nschool and in Unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think one way to cull could be to look at some that are almost<br/>\nredundancies - or to cheat by grouping some words as if they were one. The<br/>\nidea behind Life/Lifestyle/Living/real life/situations could be represented<br/>\nby one word on the list, but expanded on in the talk.<br/>\nIntegrated/connections/relationships - again maybe the word &quot;connections&quot;<br/>\nwould be enough. Family/siblings/home/closeness/relationships; talk about<br/>\nit/questions/listening/presence/available; notice/observation/perception;<br/>\npersonality/unique/acceptance; strew/offer/opportunities/available;<br/>\npleasure/passion/happiness/joy; kindness/compassion/caring/gentleness;<br/>\nartistic/creative/beauty/imagination (another set of concepts that is<br/>\ntotally different in school); Truth/authentic/genuine;<br/>\ncuriosity/dabbling/explore<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like &quot;Work it out&quot; - too much like &quot;sound it out&quot; - like being sent<br/>\nto the encyclopedia instead of answered. I guess if a word or phrase would<br/>\nrequire a lengthy explanation as to why it is a positive word if initially<br/>\nit seems to have a negative connotation it might be better off the list. How<br/>\nmuch time do you have for your presentation?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis culling is tough work. I keep thinking of more words to add instead! <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with it, Pam.

It was a horrible year, where she learned a lot  of academics , but had","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2014705766\">These &quot;100 terms&quot; remind me of the first grade teacher my youngest child had.  It was a horrible year, where she learned a lot  of &quot;academics&quot;, but had recurring tummy aches all year long.  The teacher ended up accusing her of faking it, so I took her to the doctor and discovered she had a bladder infection.  She had deep circles under her eyes all year long.  I deeply regret not pulling her out.  Since she was a &quot;good girl,&quot;  I kept hoping she&#39;d stay under the radar and survive.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThis teacher has never been a mother herself, was a complete control freak, thought she had the most organized program in the world (which she did ~ very anal).  She expected high school level discipline and attention spans from those first graders (made them sit at their desks for up to 2 hours on Friday mornings taking tests), and her classroom management techniques were very harsh (she had this weird &quot;reward&quot; system where she passed out baseball tradering cards that none of the kids cared about).  As I said, my daughter was a &quot;good girl&quot; and learned to stay out of trouble, but as a former special ed teacher my heart bled for the slow learners or those with minor &quot;behavior problems&quot; made to feel they were bad, eventually losing hope of ever pleasing her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe parents complained to the principal, who did nothing that year or the next.  But because parents finally threatened lawsuits, she was transferred out.  I once witnessed a kid (diagnosed as ADHD, assigned a full-time aide who the teacher wouldn&#39;t let sit with him) wheeled away on a stretcher in a straight-jacket (with his mom sobbing behind and not allowed to ride in the ambulance), taken to the mental health ward of the local hospital where he was kept for a week with a bunch of nutty adults ~ all because this teacher had called 911 and said the kid was out of control and the office wouldn&#39;t help her (they told her to manage until they could find an administrator to come to the room.  She said he was throwing chairs around the room, but my daughter said he was just scooting around the room on the teacher&#39;s chair with wheels.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m told that a number of kids in her second grade class last year started wetting their pants. I will always regret not pulling my child or taking a stronger stand against this woman who did so much harm.    <br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, my kids can heal from their negative experiences in school, and from the damage done by their recovering control-freak mom!!  This will be my first year homeschooling.  I&#39;ve been fascinated by all the info on unschooling I&#39;ve learned through this discussion group.

The leaves were individual hearts with <br/>\ninspiring words on them.  One word that stuck out was &quot;obedience&quot;.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve looked at this tree over and over, but I just can&#39;t see how <br/>\nobedience fits in with words like faith, love and happiness.  My co-<br/>\nworker is a devout Pentecostal who believes that God created us and <br/>\nhe can destroy us if we make him mad, therefore we should be <br/>\nobedient to Him.  To me, it sounds strange and maybe even far-<br/>\nfetched to believe that our God, who is supposed to care about us, <br/>\nwould have a temper bad enough to destroy us.  I just don&#39;t buy the <br/>\nwhole obedience thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, isn&#39;t it similar to what we feared in school?  That if we <br/>\nweren&#39;t obedient to the school we would be punished or worse?  Are <br/>\nteachers, who are supposed to care about their students, God with <br/>\nthe power to create or destroy them?
