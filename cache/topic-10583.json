(the books will be good for teenagers, too, of<br/>\n&gt; course.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At any rate, my reading list has Japanese-American, Chinese-American,<br/>\n&gt; Laotian-American, Jewish-American, Quaker (given who I am),<br/>\n&gt; Armenian-American<br/>\n&gt; Mexician-American, American Indian, African-American, and<br/>\n&gt; Norwegian-American contributions thus far.  I&#39;m looking for (especially)<br/>\n&gt; Italian-American, Polish-American, Asian Indian-American, and<br/>\n&gt; German-American novels.  Suggestions welcome -- and don&#39;t worry -- I read<br/>\n&gt; them ALL before adding to the list<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My favorite one  is the extraordinary Norwegian-American novel &quot;Giants in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; Earth&quot; by a towering giant of American literature, Ole Rolvaag, who is<br/>\n&gt; almost totally unknown outside Norwegian circles. (&quot;Giants in the Earth&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; incidentally, was actually written in Norwegian, and then translated,<br/>\n&gt; collectively, with Rolvaag in the lead, by the faculty of St. Olaf&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; College in Northfield, Minnesota.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyhow, &quot;Giants in the Earth&quot; is about the journey of 5 Norwegian<br/>\n&gt; families to a totally unsettled part of South Dakota, and their efforts<br/>\n&gt; in making a wholly new life for themselves.  It is psychologically<br/>\n&gt; gripping in its depiction of what it must have been like for people to<br/>\n&gt; head out almost totally into the unknown, and their different responses<br/>\n&gt; to it. It is absolutely stunning in its depiction of the landscape, the<br/>\n&gt; seasons, and encounters between ethnic groups as they searched for a new<br/>\n&gt; place (both outer, and inner) to call home.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But, anyhow, how I (re)discovered this book is an interesting little<br/>\n&gt; story.  I actually read it once before, when I was 14, and a sophomore in<br/>\n&gt; high school. I HATED IT, and made fun of it for the next 30 years!

I knew<br/>\n&gt; exactly one Norwegian (his name was Hans Olsen, of course, and he may<br/>\n&gt; have been the only real blonde in the school.)  My &quot;western relatives&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; who we saw only at weddings and funerals, lived in Cranford, New Jersey.<br/>\n&gt; (To the day he died, I think my grandfather thought that Indiana was the<br/>\n&gt; capital of Iowa). And this was basically the case for 95% of the school.<br/>\n&gt; The teacher was universally hated -- old Mrs. Hegarty.  I think she<br/>\n&gt; wanted to expose us to other cultures, or to rest of America, or some<br/>\n&gt; such, but it went totally over our heads (and she was absolutely no help)<br/>\n&gt; -- we felt more comfortable in the Africa of Conrad&#39;s Heart of Darkness<br/>\n&gt; than we did in South Dakota!  (I have funny stories about what I thought<br/>\n&gt; agriculture was about at the time -- some other time!)  At the time, it<br/>\n&gt; simply seemed like &quot;theater of the absurd&quot; -- people traveling through<br/>\n&gt; grass fields (no roads) at 2 miles an hour on carts drawn by oxen to<br/>\n&gt; (what seemed to me -- and which is magnificently presented in the book)<br/>\n&gt; absolutely nowhere.

(the books will be good for teenagers, too, of<br/>\ncourse.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, my reading list has Japanese-American, Chinese-American,<br/>\nLaotian-American, Jewish-American, Quaker (given who I am),<br/>\nArmenian-American<br/>\nMexician-American, American Indian, African-American, and<br/>\nNorwegian-American contributions thus far.  I&#39;m looking for (especially)<br/>\nItalian-American, Polish-American, Asian Indian-American, and<br/>\nGerman-American novels.  Suggestions welcome -- and don&#39;t worry -- I read<br/>\nthem ALL before adding to the list<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite one  is the extraordinary Norwegian-American novel &quot;Giants in<br/>\nthe<br/>\nEarth&quot; by a towering giant of American literature, Ole Rolvaag, who is<br/>\nalmost totally unknown outside Norwegian circles. (&quot;Giants in the Earth&quot;,<br/>\nincidentally, was actually written in Norwegian, and then translated,<br/>\ncollectively, with Rolvaag in the lead, by the faculty of St. Olaf&#39;s<br/>\nCollege in Northfield, Minnesota.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, &quot;Giants in the Earth&quot; is about the journey of 5 Norwegian<br/>\nfamilies to a totally unsettled part of South Dakota, and their efforts<br/>\nin making a wholly new life for themselves.  It is psychologically<br/>\ngripping in its depiction of what it must have been like for people to<br/>\nhead out almost totally into the unknown, and their different responses<br/>\nto it. It is absolutely stunning in its depiction of the landscape, the<br/>\nseasons, and encounters between ethnic groups as they searched for a new<br/>\nplace (both outer, and inner) to call home.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, anyhow, how I (re)discovered this book is an interesting little<br/>\nstory.  I actually read it once before, when I was 14, and a sophomore in<br/>\nhigh school. I HATED IT, and made fun of it for the next 30 years!  Now,<br/>\nyou have to get the picture: I was a Jewish New Yorker at an all-male<br/>\nhigh school for science nerds in Manhattan.  The school at the time was<br/>\nabout 85-90% Jewish, 5% Asian, and a smattering of everyone else.  I knew<br/>\nexactly one Norwegian (his name was Hans Olsen, of course, and he may<br/>\nhave been the only real blonde in the school.)  My &quot;western relatives&quot;,<br/>\nwho we saw only at weddings and funerals, lived in Cranford, New Jersey.<br/>\n(To the day he died, I think my grandfather thought that Indiana was the<br/>\ncapital of Iowa). And this was basically the case for 95% of the school.<br/>\nThe teacher was universally hated -- old Mrs. Hegarty.  I think she<br/>\nwanted to expose us to other cultures, or to rest of America, or some<br/>\nsuch, but it went totally over our heads (and she was absolutely no help)<br/>\n-- we felt more comfortable in the Africa of Conrad&#39;s Heart of Darkness<br/>\nthan we did in South Dakota!  (I have funny stories about what I thought<br/>\nagriculture was about at the time -- some other time!)  At the time, it<br/>\nsimply seemed like &quot;theater of the absurd&quot; -- people traveling through<br/>\ngrass fields (no roads) at 2 miles an hour on carts drawn by oxen to<br/>\n(what seemed to me -- and which is magnificently presented in the book)<br/>\nabsolutely nowhere.  Now, 35 years later, I can fully appreciate how<br/>\nabsolutely extraordinary the book really is, as well as the people it<br/>\ndescribes who left Norway to settle the upper Midwest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, anyhow, when I began to lead workshops on diversity and multicultural<br/>\nissues, I quickly became aware that I knew more about the feelings of<br/>\nAmerican Indians, African Americans, etc., as expressed in literature,<br/>\nthan I did about the European settlers of middle America!  Your<br/>\nsuggestions will be most welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help!<br/>\n<br/>\ndavid<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt;  The Klement Family       &quot;Education is what survives when<br/>\n&gt;  Darryl, Debbie,           what has been learned has been<br/>\n&gt;  Kathleen, Nathan &        forgotten&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  Samantha                  B.F.
