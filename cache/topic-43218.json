Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey didn&#39;t get mentioned but Michael and Debi Pearl are (or were?) a big<br/>\ninfluence in fundy circles with their Train Up a Child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nogreaterjoy.org/\">http://nogreaterjoy.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a couple of things from <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nogreaterjoy.org/subject1.htm\">http://nogreaterjoy.org/subject1.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Please give me a description of the switch or rod of which you so often<br/>\nspeak. I wish you could send me one so I could see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nA: The rod we speak of is a plumbing supply line that can be bought at any<br/>\nhardware store or large department store. It is a slim, flexible, plastic<br/>\ntubing that supplies water to sinks, and toilets. Ask for &quot;1Ž4 inch supply<br/>\nline.&quot; They cost less than one dollar. I always give myself one swat before<br/>\nI swat the child to remind myself how much force to exert. It stings the<br/>\nskin without bruising or damaging tissue. It¹s a real attention geter.<br/>\nMichael demonstrates its use in our new Seminar videos.<br/>\n<br/>\nMistraining at Three Months<br/>\n  <br/>\nOne of the young mothers in the church tells how she trained her<br/>\nthree-month-old daughter to cry and whine to be picked up and held. Upon<br/>\nseeing her parents start to drift into another room, the baby cried out. The<br/>\nfather responded, ³Get little Suzy, she wants to be with us.² Mother picked<br/>\nup Suzy, and she spread her beautiful smile in delight. Well, that¹s the<br/>\nreal life story of how Suzy was trained to whine. She initiated an act,<br/>\nwhining, to which the mother responded by picking her up. That was the first<br/>\nday of a lifelong habit.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe will refine her technique, employing more threats and spreading more<br/>\nmisery. She will eventually fall on the floor, kicking her feet and<br/>\nscreaming. The mother will be embarrassed in public, frustrated and angry at<br/>\nhome, and will eventually have such contention and strife between her and<br/>\nher demanding daughter that she will write a letter to us wanting to know<br/>\nhow to deal with an angry, undisciplined and unthankful teenager.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
