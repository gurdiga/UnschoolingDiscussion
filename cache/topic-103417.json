There are leader applicants <br/>\n(novices) and then there is a leader who is in charge of corresponding with <br/>\nthem, checking out their temperament and beliefs (their faith, as it were) and <br/>\nthat would be the sister assigned to train the novices.  And the leaders have to <br/>\nsee them in action with their kids and to testify/avow that the mom is really <br/>\npracticing the LLL way of life.  And the principles have to be agreed to <br/>\nindividually.   I was put on hold because instead of saying back exactly what the <br/>\nleader applicant correspondent wanted me to say (I knew the right answer, and <br/>\nasked my sponsoring leader whether I should just recite the right answers and <br/>\nshe said no, be honest), I questioned the item about breastfeeding making <br/>\ndiscipline easier (don&#39;t remember the wording anymore), and anyway, then I got <br/>\npregnant with Marty and was more involved with the Ceasarean Prevention Movement <br/>\n(an organization that was later renamed) and I dropped out of the leader <br/>\napplicant process.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I don&#39;t want to do that for unschoolers, even though sometimes it does <br/>\nbother me that someone will be going on and on about unschooling and when I see <br/>\nher and her kids in their own natural environment it doesn&#39;t seem they&#39;re <br/>\nliving as the mom said they were.  Some people talk bigger and grow into it later.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo match LLL and API we&#39;d have to have an approved reading list.  And we&#39;d <br/>\nhave to have a required reading list for leaders.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t sound fun to me and I hope nobody ever does it, but what are the <br/>\nodds?  People like to make rules and clubs and laws and all.   I was in the SCA <br/>\nwhen the whole rule book was about 20 pages long, and the rules for fighting <br/>\nfit on one page, and were mostly &quot;Be nice and be honest.&quot;  Now there are Way, <br/>\nway way too many rules about everything, and once a rule is approved and <br/>\naccepted, it&#39;s nearly impossible to undo it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout unschooling, I think it should be kept mysterious to the point that <br/>\nonly those who can figure out what it is and how it works will do it.  If there <br/>\nare TOO many easy entry points and if people were to start guiding others <br/>\nthrough it step by step in person with weekly organized prescribed-topic meetings, <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t we end up with people who didn&#39;t have the temperament for it and who <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t do it if the external directives stopped?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m wrong, but it seems those who want step by step instructions won&#39;t <br/>\nbe able to sustain unschooling for the years it takes for kids to grow up and  <br/>\nbe out on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes creativity and awareness and initiative and interactions that others <br/>\ncan&#39;t direct.  We can help people see it and try it, but we can&#39;t sustain it <br/>\nfor them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103324,"nextTopicId":103368}}
