That combination made for some <br/>\nexciting times,  but she&#39;s 19 now,  lives on her own and her <br/>\njudgement seems to have improved.  She&#39;s the reason we started <br/>\nhschooling when she was 15.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How late to you allow your dd/ds to be out at night?   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>We have a city-wide curfew of midnight 7 days a week,  so the police <br/>\ncan pick our kids up if they&#39;re out after that.  We used that as <br/>\nwell as an earlier one on weeknights (11 or so).  That doesn&#39;t mean <br/>\nshe always followed it.  With my 13 year old,  I plan on <br/>\nindividualizing for the situation and negotiating,  but we&#39;ll <br/>\nprobably still have to stick to the midnight because of the city <br/>\nordinance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you wait up for your dd/ds to get home when s/he is out for the evening?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was usually up,  but if not,  we had an agreement that she would <br/>\nwake us up when she came in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you ask your dd/ds to call you during their evening out?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes - we asked her to check in frequently, especially since kids <br/>\nseem to move around alot,  and sometimes when they leave home,  they <br/>\nhave no idea where they&#39;ll actually end up.   I&#39;ve got to say - <br/>\nCaller ID is a real plus here.  You know where they&#39;re calling from <br/>\nand who&#39;s calling them.  Granted,   they can block it,  but that <br/>\nwould immediately raise my suspicions.  A cell phone wouldn&#39;t be bad <br/>\neither.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How far away are you comfortable allowing your dd/ds to drive?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>We live in a college town and everywhere she needed to be was within the city <br/>\nlimits.  We tried to keep her from leaving town until after she was <br/>\nabout 18 :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If your dd/ds is going to a party at the house of someone you don&#39;t know, do <br/>\n&gt; you call the parents to make sure an adult will be there?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve done this with limited success.  It takes cooperation from other <br/>\nparents who sometimes hold different values from ours.  I still think <br/>\nit&#39;s worth trying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Unschooling complicates the decision-making on some of these issues (a week <br/>\n&gt; night isn&#39;t a &quot;school night&quot;, for example) and I&#39;m curious about other <br/>\n&gt; unschooling families.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter&#39;s friends were all in ps,  so we ended up sticking with a <br/>\nmore normal week.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!  I think one of the most important things is to let your <br/>\ndaughter help you set the limits.   Some kids,  like my daughter are going <br/>\nto push whatever limits you set.  With those kids,  you kind of hold <br/>\nyour breath and keep your fingers crossed.   My 13 year old has a <br/>\ncompletely different personality and I think,  will need less in the <br/>\nway of restrictions.  We&#39;ll see,  I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane in KS</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4756,"nextTopicId":4760}}
