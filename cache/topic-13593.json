He loves books on tape<br/>\nfrom the library...even ones that might seem boring to<br/>\nothers.  He loves to listen to the radio.  We have a<br/>\npublic radio station that plays old time radio plays<br/>\non Sunday evenings and he just loves those. <br/>\nI also read aloud to him just as much as I possibly<br/>\ncan and I&#39;m always amazed at how much he remembers and<br/>\nknows about the stories and characters.<br/>\nI bought him his own CD Walkman for Christmas and he<br/>\njust loves to wear his earphones and listen to books<br/>\non CD.  He goes to sleep that way, in fact.  <br/>\nI would just encourage you to find ways to aid your<br/>\nson in this style, because helping my son find<br/>\nauditory ways to learn has just really helped him. <br/>\nHe&#39;s very non-verbal and has a hard time writing, so<br/>\nhe had a tendency to feel insecure in groups where<br/>\nthose skills are valued (namely, school!)  But,<br/>\nshowing him that there is a way that he can learn<br/>\neasily has really encouraged him.  <br/>\nBoomerang is great, I have to say.  We&#39;re lucky to<br/>\nhave it at our library.  Maybe you could suggest the<br/>\npurchase to the library?  I know our system is open to<br/>\nsuggestions from readers.  Or maybe somebody out there<br/>\ncould buy it for him for a birthday/Christmas gift? <br/>\nMy daughter wanted it so badly that she saved up money<br/>\nfrom babysitting, etc. to buy it for herself, so now<br/>\nwe don&#39;t even check it out from the library!<br/>\nKeep looking...sound like you&#39;re on the right track!<br/>\nCarol B.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"A.
