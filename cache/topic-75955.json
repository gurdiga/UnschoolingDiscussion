My just turned 4 dd Micaela is like this.  She is the one who makes sure we have drinks and snacks for everyone when we go out.  She also likes to organize products on store shelves when we are shopping.  She doesn&#39;t understand why people don&#39;t put the computer games back where they belong at Sam&#39;s Club.  We can&#39;t leave the store until she has organized them all....<br/>\n<br/>\nMaggy<br/>\nA Mother&#39;s Touch Photography<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pages.ivillage.com/momaggy2/\">http://pages.ivillage.com/momaggy2/</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n   <br/>\n   I asked if she had sunscreen.
