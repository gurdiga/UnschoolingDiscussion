For me, that means if we pick up whatever projects and <br/>\nplaythings the kids have left out, the room is basically clean. So I <br/>\ndo a rotation on cleaning throughout the week so that on any given <br/>\nday the bathrooms are cleaned and swiped, the floor has been <br/>\nvacuumed/swept within the last couple of days, the dishes are clean <br/>\nand put away and the counters and tables are clean, the linens and <br/>\ntowels are washed, etc. It takes much less time to keep things clean <br/>\nthan to get them clean once a certain amount of grime has hardened on <br/>\nthem, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than the cleanliness though, we have some rooms in the house <br/>\nthat stay relatively neat, and some rooms that are more or less a <br/>\ntotal disaster. The kids have their huge bedroom/bonus room and my <br/>\nson has his Lego room, and the office - all these rooms generally <br/>\nhave stuff out in various stages of creation. The bathtubs often have <br/>\nongoing science experiments in them or paintings drying or whatever. <br/>\nBut the basic living areas - living room, kitchen, and dining room, <br/>\nas well as our master bedroom - stay pretty decluttered of kid stuff. <br/>\nEspecially my bedroom, I have a basket for kids toys that somehow end <br/>\nup in there - all the stuffed animals in my bed, the dress-up clothes <br/>\nand swords on the floor, etc. When the basket is full, it goes back <br/>\nto the kids&#39; room to be emptied. That way my room stays relatively <br/>\nneat and peaceful looking every night when I go to bed. I like my <br/>\nbedroom to be a sanctuary, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DH is totally spartan and a neat freak, I grew up in a totally <br/>\nclutter-overtaken house that always felt claustrophobic to me.

Definitely. Tidy house, depends on how anal one is and how much<br/>\ntime they want to put into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy house is very clean. I work at it every day. The kids rooms are another<br/>\nstory. They are also clean but you would never think it by looking at them.<br/>\nThere is stuff everywhere on any given day. Once in awhile if I&#39;m having<br/>\nproblems walking to the beds and closet, I&#39;ll ask for some help in putting<br/>\nthings away. I do also like to vacuum in the bedrooms at least once a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe playroom is pretty much left up to the kids as well. Although being that<br/>\nthey eat in there, I do ask to be able to vacuum more often. Crumbs on the<br/>\nfloor in FL is a no no. But I can also vacuum around stuff and just do spots<br/>\nas needed. If someone is coming over, the kids usually straighten up so that<br/>\nthere is more room to play and mess up!!! There are days when nothing is on<br/>\nthe dining room table and then weeks where it&#39;s covered with paints, play<br/>\ndough, creepy crawlers, etc. We hardly ever actually use the dining room<br/>\ntable to eat at unless it&#39;s an occasion. We have a kitchen table we can sit<br/>\nat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s important to me to have some organized space in the house. I could care<br/>\nless what anyone else thinks, but I need that for me. So my bedroom isn&#39;t<br/>\nfor toys although it&#39;s more than inviting for kids. Also the living room.<br/>\nThe kids do puzzles and books there but nothing else. That&#39;s what the<br/>\nbedrooms, playroom and my moms place is for.  &lt;BG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if it&#39;s not important to you, don&#39;t worry about what others do or think.<br/>\nIf it is important to you, make a compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164396504,"authorName":"Elizabeth Roberts","from":"Elizabeth Roberts &lt;mamabethuscg@...&gt;","profile":"mamabethuscg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Clean House?","postDate":"1077378391","msgId":91243,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMjIxMTU0NjMxLjI2MTM1LnFtYWlsQHNwYW4uY29ycC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMjAwMWMzZjgyYyRhNGJiNjVhMCQ3NmQwMDVjZkBXYWxsaW5nZm9yZD4="},"prevInTopic":91238,"nextInTopic":91248,"prevInTime":91242,"nextInTime":91244,"topicId":91227,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"For the most part, I don t mind the daily clutter of life in progress...but my husband is a neatnik.

He likes to mix water with whatever and call it an invention (Air freshener, Bug killer ect...) He loves to watch water freeze in the freezer in different shaped containers.
