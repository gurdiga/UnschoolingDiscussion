I would not expect any unschooler to jump","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1313237915\">&lt;&lt;but actually lack of effective strewing and communication&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust using your quote as a jumping off point, Patti.  I would not expect any<br/>\nunschooler to jump into school and be &quot;on grade level&quot;.  They will be above<br/>\nin some things and behind in others.  It is normal development.  It is<br/>\nabnormal to expect people to be on the same level in many areas.  And it is<br/>\nimportant to remember that the school is only measuring things that kids are<br/>\n&quot;supposed&quot; to learn at that level, not all areas of knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ds is 9.  He loves math concepts but would be way, way &quot;behind&quot; if he<br/>\nwent into a 4th grade classroom.  Zach likes to play around in his head with<br/>\nnumeric patterns but if you asked him to do a multiplication problem, it<br/>\nwould blow his mind.  Now he solves &quot;multiplication problems&quot; everyday (he<br/>\nlikes to use counting by 2&#39;s, or 5&#39;s or whatever to do it) but I don&#39;t think<br/>\nhe would even recognize a multiplication problem written out.  Mainly<br/>\nbecause you usually don&#39;t see multiplication problems written out in real<br/>\nlife unless you write it out yourself while trying to solve a problem.<br/>\nZach&#39;s world doesn&#39;t yet involve such large numbers that he can&#39;t solve it<br/>\nin his head.  However, if they wanted to talk physics to Zach he would blow<br/>\nthem out of the water,.....but 4th graders aren&#39;t allowed to learn that yet<br/>\n&lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nZach doesn&#39;t read very well, in fact hardly at all.  I have strewn about as<br/>\nmuch as I can strew along those lines.  I read to him as often as he would<br/>\nlike.  I have read every Harry Potter and Hank the Cowdog outloud until my<br/>\nthroat hurt.  We have magnetic letters on the fridge that various kids play<br/>\nwith and we fiddle with it as we want.  We play Scrabble Jr., etc..  Zach<br/>\nlikes the weather so I showed him how to find the weather in the newspaper.<br/>\nHe still doesn&#39;t read very well.  It doesn&#39;t particularly interest him yet<br/>\nand he simply isn&#39;t ready.  If he went to school, he would be labeled an<br/>\n&quot;unschooling failure&quot; because he would be way behind.  But ask Zach about<br/>\ngenetics, animal husbandry, sex, etc. and he would be a &quot;prodigy&quot; but 4th<br/>\ngraders aren&#39;t supposed to learn that yet.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools only have round holes and the measure of success is how well you fit<br/>\ninto that hole.  Unschoolers come in all shapes and sizes and have a<br/>\ntendency to carve out their own holes that fit just right.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50284,"nextTopicId":50303}}
