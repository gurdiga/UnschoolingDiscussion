I joined this list quite awhile ago but never<br/>\nparticipated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m 34, married, and have 4 kids. Our boys are almost 17, 10 and 21<br/>\nmonths. Our daughter is 3 1/2.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are a very unstructured, unconventional family, but I&#39;m not sure<br/>\nif this is actually working for us now. Our home is constantley<br/>\ntettering on the edge of disaster. Household help is not given<br/>\nunless I give a very specific request. Things that need to be done<br/>\nare done at the last minute, and so on ...  I am curious about what<br/>\nother unschooler&#39;s &#39;routines&#39; or scheduals are like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also interested in what other opinions are on how much<br/>\nhousework/chores should be expected of 17 & 10 year old boys who are<br/>\nnot spending 8 hours or more a day at a school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nLauren<br/>\nAustin, TX<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCarrie<br/>\nGod Loves A Cheerful FlyLady!!<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60033,"nextTopicId":60040}}
