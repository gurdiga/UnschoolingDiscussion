My husband finished reading to us<br/>\n&quot;How to Eat Fried Worms&quot; which he had started reading at breakfast.<br/>\nAfter he was done, he  read about other books the author hs written. DS<br/>\ndid not know the meaning of a word being read, so DH said &quot;Look it up.&quot;<br/>\nA couple of minutes later, my bedroom was invaded by a little boy<br/>\nbringing in a dictionary &quot;to look it up.&quot;  The word was &#39;sly&#39; He didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow the meaning of one of the words in the definition, so proceeded to<br/>\nlook it up. The dictionary he was using didn&#39;t have one of the words for<br/>\nwhich he was searching, so he ended up bringing in two others, including<br/>\na Children&#39;s Dictionary. He only accepted my offer to help when he could<br/>\nnot decipher a word. His comment was: &quot;This is my search.&quot; He sat on my<br/>\nbed going between three dictionaries for several minutes before deciding<br/>\nto read the Children&#39;s one. He pored over it for quite a while, and<br/>\nended up drawing his version of a soccer field he saw pictured in it.<br/>\nAnother cool part was that he said using a dictionary is easy, He<br/>\ncritiqued the differences in how two of them were arranged based on user<br/>\nfriendliness.<br/>\nIt was so cool to see my normally non reading son get so much into<br/>\nlooking up a word and reading a dictionary.  It is times like this that<br/>\nremind me why we try to unschool.<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25880,"nextTopicId":25886}}
