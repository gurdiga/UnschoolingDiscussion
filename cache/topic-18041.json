I have<br/>\na mothering kind of question for you.  I am really interested in finding<br/>\nabout my child&#39;s temperament.  I have a sneaky suspicion that we may be<br/>\non opposite ends of the spectrum.  I know an awful lot about learning<br/>\nstyles but I am more interested in getting the core of my dd and what<br/>\nmakes her tick.  Does any one have any book recommendations or even<br/>\nbetter online websites or resources I can check out on temperaments<br/>\nespecially in children.  My girlfriend recommended a great site with a<br/>\n&quot;test&quot; and everything but it was definitely aimed at adults.
