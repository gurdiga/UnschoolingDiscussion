Yes, there is disrespectful talk amongst them,  but your son isn&#39;t going to learn how to treat others from a tv show.  My son watches it sometimes,  sometimes its pretty funny,  I&#39;ve watched it with him.   I can&#39;t say that I really enjoy the show but his humor might be different than mine.     There is humor there,   and that&#39;s why he watches it,    to laugh.  He truly doesn&#39;t treat others the way Ed would (or Eddy) &lt;g&gt;.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as Fairly Oddparents,  we actually had an awesome talk about US History coming from that show.  We&#39;ve also had some really good talks about parent/children relationships from watching that show,  the parents in this show are pretty pathetic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we can get over our own judgemental thinking regarding certain shows and their values(in our eyes),  we will then be able to see why our children choose to watch them.   <br/>\n<br/>\nCouldn&#39;t some of it also be that he picks up on what you don&#39;t want him watching?    He&#39;s going to want to check those ones out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOur family has been so much more peaceful and joyful since we&#39;ve allowed our children freedom.

For the last few weeks he would go to the <br/>\nplayroom and have the TV running all day.  He sometimes plays while <br/>\nhe watches or sits right in front of it.  I am not a big fan of <br/>\ncartoon network in general.  I actually prefer some of the japanese <br/>\nshows because at least there is a moral to the story.  WE like Yu-go-<br/>\ni-oh and Jackie Chan, but then again we all watch together because <br/>\nit is at night and a calm time for us.   However, I don&#39;t like <br/>\nTotally Spies for how it has to show the heroines as girly shoppers <br/>\n(the valley girl stereotype).  My dh watched Ed, Ed, Eddy with him <br/>\nand said the way in which some of the characters talked to eachother <br/>\nshowed alot of rudeness although I have not seen that one.  The <br/>\nfairly oddparents really gets under my skin and that one we do not <br/>\nallow because I think he is too young.  In general, I think I am <br/>\nhaving difficulty seeing value in some of these shows.  I am <br/>\nstruggling with how much freedom to give.  IS he making an <br/>\nintelligent choice or just staring like a dog foaming at the mouth  <br/>\nwatching shows that corporate america has put out there marketed to <br/>\nlittle boys (harsh but how I feel. At this point I feel the only <br/>\nreason he is watching is because it is on cartoon network.  I have <br/>\ntried to discuss that just because it is on that channel does not <br/>\nmean it is a good choice.  I am struggling with balancing that with <br/>\ngiving hime the freedom to make his own choices.  Now, I am getting <br/>\nthe run down on every toy out there, as if we don&#39;t have <br/>\nenough..LOL...now I will have to explain the concept of Zen and the <br/>\nTao to him ;).

It is just the <br/>\nexcitement of it which I am trying to keep in mind.  However, there <br/>\nare certain shows that I would prefer he does not watch because of <br/>\nthe way the people treat eachother or characters are portrayed.

If we are going to look at the broader social<br/>\nsignificance of Max and Ruby, the idea that life will be full of<br/>\nrulebound people in authority over us, and that the way to deal with<br/>\nthem is a combination of miserable aquiescence and passive-aggressive<br/>\nmanipulations, is not the ideal message either. However the idea that<br/>\nchildren are people with ideas, creativity and important activities is a<br/>\npositive message.<br/>\n<br/>\nDharma was at least home schooled, and probably unschooled. In an<br/>\nepisode about Greg&#39;s old high school, Dharma talks about learning about<br/>\ngeography and weather by hot air ballooning. However the charm of that<br/>\nidea is then undercut when it turns out that her spaced-out father<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t work the balloon properly and they always ended up in the same<br/>\nplace every year.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat network sitcom about the stay-at-home Dad which I can&#39;t remember<br/>\nthe name of, was partially about homeschoolers. I remember there was one<br/>\nepisode where the support group was meeting at the star&#39;s house - I only<br/>\nsaw a couple of eps. The uptight-school-at-homer&#39;s kid couldn&#39;t name the<br/>\ncapitals of states when pressed and hinted to, but the quiet relaxed<br/>\nmom&#39;s kid was able to spell Tallahassee when everyone else had left the<br/>\nroom. That was still a skewed picture, and the show was axed after a<br/>\nbrief period, but I don&#39;t think it was because of the hs subplot.

I am irritated by<br/>\n  Ruby because she, in common with so many ordinary parents, constantly<br/>\n  quotes &quot;rules&quot; unthinkingly as in the above example - you can&#39;t have ice<br/>\n  cream for breakfast - and forces Max to become manipulative and sneaky.<br/>\n  He leaves the house without telling her where he is going and she has to<br/>\n  run all over looking for him. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Ruby constantly rides absolutely roughshod over anything Max may be<br/>\n  engaged in with the attitude that only her concerns are important and<br/>\n  anything he is doing must give way, regardless of his stated desire to<br/>\n  keep doing his own activity. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Max, you can&#39;t play dumptrucks<br/>\n  just now.

Now I believe that she should be free<br/>\n  to play with them without Max, but since there is no one else to<br/>\n  actually engage him or look after him, it just seems cruel.

In one episode we<br/>\n  discover that Ruby and Louise are seven. Personally I think that is too<br/>\n  young to have the sole responsibility for another youngster.

She has no respect for Max&#39;s space, and practices food<br/>\n  restrictions with a vengeance.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And probably most annoying of all, Ruby is a heinous little liar and<br/>\n  cheat. In almost every episode to do with Bunny Scouts, Ruby takes the<br/>\n  credit for some accidental action of Max&#39;s, even to the extent of<br/>\n  keeping her merit badge for knots which Max was entirely responsible<br/>\n  for. The badge is clearly visible on her sash in subsequent episodes,<br/>\n  and she couldn&#39;t tie a knot to save her life.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe it is not such a horrible example of pseudo-enlightened parenting<br/>\n  in the books, but I mostly hate the stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Robyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Do you<br/>\nrealize that there is no bedroom in the house for parents? They only<br/>\nexist in one picture on the wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Easter episode bugged me, because Max was virtually forced to become<br/>\na thief by Ruby&#39;s unreasonable competitive attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nRuby has a horror of dirt, interrupting anything for baths, cleaning and<br/>\ntidying. She has no respect for Max&#39;s space, and practices food<br/>\nrestrictions with a vengeance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd probably most annoying of all, Ruby is a heinous little liar and<br/>\ncheat. In almost every episode to do with Bunny Scouts, Ruby takes the<br/>\ncredit for some accidental action of Max&#39;s, even to the extent of<br/>\nkeeping her merit badge for knots which Max was entirely responsible<br/>\nfor. The badge is clearly visible on her sash in subsequent episodes,<br/>\nand she couldn&#39;t tie a knot to save her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it is not such a horrible example of pseudo-enlightened parenting<br/>\nin the books, but I mostly hate the stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] enjoying my kids","postDate":"1065708282","msgId":82579,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkZC4xMjM3YmM4MS4yY2I2YzRmYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":82576,"nextInTopic":82582,"prevInTime":82578,"nextInTime":82580,"topicId":82417,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/9/03 7:23:33 AM, arcarpenter@cs.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-956723771\">In a message dated 10/9/03 7:23:33 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:arcarpenter@...\">arcarpenter@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Fisher and I have talked long ago about &quot;what ads are for,&quot; and though he <br/>\nstill likes to watch them and say &quot;we gotta get that&quot;, he understands.    <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think more parents shouuld say &quot;Maybe we should; why are you thinking we <br/>\nneed it?&quot; though instead of &quot;NO WAY!

I&#39;ve <br/>\nhelped my children to see the reasons behind ads.  Even my five year old <br/>\ncan state the reasons for media (influence, educate, entertain, I think, <br/>\nthey are asleep) and can articulate that the ads are definitely there to <br/>\ninfluence your decision to buy something, to spend your money.  Lexie is <br/>\nvery savvy about the various ways advertisers have to attempt to get her <br/>\nto purchase a product.  She&#39;s very much her own person.  She has a few <br/>\nfriends who are in school, and she laughs at how much they are <br/>\ninfluenced by their peers and magazines, etc. to dress, behave, etc. in <br/>\na certain way.  She really makes her own decisions.  THat doesn&#39;t mean <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t watch ads nor does she ignore them, but she looks at them <br/>\ncritically, which is how I look at them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have done what I do, they record shows and skim past the <br/>\ncommercials.  Or they like shows on commercial free tv. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe was very interested in the recent california election, and watched <br/>\nthose ads closely.  She had nicknames for each one, some not very polite <br/>\n(AS was the guy with the weird voice, Bustamonte was big butt (suggested <br/>\nby my father, sadly), Davis was bald spot... She saw right through the <br/>\ntrash talk and wondered why they weren&#39;t discussing the real issues. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the bottom line is we have to trust our children.  Your <br/>\nquestions come out of the idea that kids cannot be trusted to manage <br/>\ntheir own lives, that if allowed, they would do nothing but watch tv, <br/>\neat junk food, play video games, stay up all night and want to sleep all <br/>\nday, that it is necessary that some adult, some person in control, <br/>\ncontrol them, keep them safe from themselves, from their wild ways.  I <br/>\nreally think nothing could be the farthest from the truth.  So often <br/>\nkids are so controlled, they are controlled every minute of the day, <br/>\neven their bathroom habits are controlled (in school, they must get <br/>\npermission to go to the bathroom), so there is no doubt that these <br/>\nchildren, when given some free time or some control over their lives, <br/>\nend up doing things in excess instead of in moderation. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, we have to trust the children.  To me this does not mean that I <br/>\nstop parenting.  It just means that my job is more a facilitator, a <br/>\nguide, a helper, not a controller.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] enjoying my kids","postDate":"1065679157","msgId":82562,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMzOGUyYSQ3ZDE1NjJiMCQzNDAwYThjMEByb2J5bm1hY2hpbmU+","inReplyToHeader":"PDFjMC5mZjUyOTFmLjJjYjVhNmE5QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":82478,"nextInTopic":82564,"prevInTime":82561,"nextInTime":82563,"topicId":82417,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Jayn likes a wide range of cartoons on","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1969370672\">&lt;&lt;And <br/>\ndo you have concerns about the corporate/advertising influence on your<br/>\nkids <br/>\n-- <br/>\nif so, how do you handle that? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn likes a wide range of cartoons on channels with commercials, most<br/>\nrecently Kim Possible (Disney), Scooby Doo (Boom and Cartoon Network),<br/>\nMary-Kate and Ashley in Action (Disney) and perennial favorite, Max and<br/>\nRuby (Nick Jr.) which I really do not like much and am constantly<br/>\nsubverting with my remarks about why I don&#39;t like Ruby&#39;s behavior. We<br/>\nalso love Toad Patrol (Disney) but have now seen both seasons so often<br/>\nwe almost know the dialogue. On commercial free cable - Discovery Kids<br/>\nand TLC, Jayn likes Hi-5 (a variety show), Brum, (about an English<br/>\nminiature car), and the filler material about Pez the Penguin, who seems<br/>\nto be a homeschooler, but I don&#39;t know if that is intentional.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch of the time we record onto our satellite receiver, similar to TiVo,<br/>\nso we can zap through the commercials. I have to say we do that mostly<br/>\nfor my comfort. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of influenced to buy, yes Jayn sometimes sees toys that she<br/>\nmight not otherwise notice, and asks for them. However, my experience is<br/>\nthat often the desire is as transitory as the commercial, and when she<br/>\nsees the item in the store, she decides against it. Not always though.<br/>\n;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the other influence of corporate culture - I think we counteract<br/>\nthat over time with our open lifestyle. Jayn tends to believe things she<br/>\nhears from living people much more readily. For example she never stated<br/>\nthat Barbie&#39;s were only for girls until she heard one mother say so, to<br/>\nher not much more than toddler, son at Kay-Bee toys the other day.

They were not allowed<br/>\nto watch during the week  and only on the weekends after their chores were<br/>\ndone. Even then they were not allowed to watch &#39;just anything&#39;. And<br/>\nespecially not anything on &#39;commercial television&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nShortly after joining this group for the second time (the first time,I<br/>\nlurked for a week and unsubbed in terror at the concepts being discussed<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;), I lifted the restrictions on the amount my kids watched. They can<br/>\nwatch TV/videos whenever they want to.<br/>\n<br/>\n Because they have been really sheltered we are still careful about what<br/>\nthey watch.  Both the boys watched the special features discs of the Lord of<br/>\nthe Rings movies to get a feel for the content and then watched certain<br/>\nscenes before sitting down to watch the whole movie and we watched it with<br/>\nthem. We have shown Mia some of it but we have waited till she is in bed<br/>\nbefore it goes on as some of it has scared her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t watch much TV as our reception sucks! They might watch cartoons on<br/>\na Saturday but mostly they prefer to put a DVD on. We have been trying to<br/>\nbuy more so they have a good selection. They aren&#39;t overly interested in<br/>\nadult type movies (all that yucky kissing!! eew, gross Mum!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe probably are more restrictive than others here but I think it&#39;s easier to<br/>\nadjust to lifted restriction if you do it gradually. Going from Thomas the<br/>\nTank Engine to The Terminator in one small step isn&#39;t being kind or careful!<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI &#39;m glad we have lightened up.

Thank you for sharing.  It does bring up another <br/>\nquestion that I&#39;ve been bouncing around in my head for a while, though, so I think <br/>\nI&#39;ll go ahead and ask, although I have a sense that it has been dealt with <br/>\nbefore here.  It has to do with TV and bedtime restrictions.  I have read many <br/>\nof the links on www.SandraDodd.com and I am understanding how TV, video games, <br/>\netc. are &quot;information dense&quot; (love that perspective) and very much part of the <br/>\nunschooly-being-in-the-world genius.  My question -- do most of you have no <br/>\nrestrictions as far as age-appropriateness and/or time spent watching TV?  And <br/>\ndo you have concerns about the corporate/advertising influence on your kids -- <br/>\nif so, how do you handle that?  I think I can work toward trusting him, <br/>\nknowing he will choose content that he finds compelling and therefore is not <br/>\n&quot;trash&quot; (even Power Rangers -- that&#39;s a new one for us and my ex-teacher self is <br/>\nsilently struggling with that), but are there any pitfalls with that attitude <br/>\nthat I need to be aware of? <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as bedtime goes, do most of you just let your kids sleep when they&#39;re <br/>\ntired?  (Gee, it sounds so sensible when I put it that way. &lt;g&gt;)  It&#39;s a <br/>\nbeautiful night and I love the idea of Fisher being able to enjoy it with me (I&#39;m a <br/>\nnight walker) . . . but I also get kind of an icky feeling when we get in the <br/>\nhabit of sleeping late in the morning.  I hate to miss the beautiful early <br/>\nmorning hours, and I guess years of socialization has taught me to feel lazy <br/>\nwhen I (or my son) sleep in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other news  -- I&#39;m reading John Holt&#39;s Instead of Education (I just <br/>\ninstinctively like him) and Fisher told me how he was unfairly punished today in <br/>\nschool -- I don&#39;t like that he was unhappy, but I might like where that <br/>\nunhappiness could lead . . . &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace, and TIA,<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139187074,"authorName":"Julie Solich","from":"&quot;Julie Solich&quot; &lt;mjsolich@...&gt;","profile":"foxymophandlemama32","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"enjoying my kids","postDate":"1065580722","msgId":82417,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMWIwMWMzOGQ0NSQ0YWVlNThlMCQwMzYyMWFkM0BtYXJrPg==","referencesHeader":"PDdlLjNmMzRkNGY3LjJjYjQ3MTJkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":82423,"prevInTime":82416,"nextInTime":82418,"topicId":82417,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I began the year with a program for the first term, chore charts on the wall, set bedtime and life was...organized!

My boys were unhappy every<br/>\nmorning and Mia was kept busy with something while we did our work.<br/>\n<br/>\nTen months later, the chore chart disappeared a long time ago and bedtime is<br/>\nwhen the boys are tired usually around 10pm after a movie or a good story or<br/>\nplaying with Dad on the couch or for Mia when she asks to be put to bed. The<br/>\nkids spend their days doing just what they want to do and Mia is free to be<br/>\nwith me as much as she likes.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I got angry about something and I yelled at one of the kids. I<br/>\nshocked myself!! It sounded so horrible not to mention unnecessary. And<br/>\nweird. I realized it sounded weird because it isn&#39;t something I do very<br/>\noften and although I felt bad for yelling, it felt good to know that it was<br/>\nthe first time in a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nA typical day?  Yesterday we were all up at about 8:30 and the kids watched<br/>\na couple of Magic School Bus videos while they had breakfast. The boys rode<br/>\ntheir bikes for awhile then came inside and put Harry Potter and the Order<br/>\nof the Phoenix on (CD). Jess played on the computer while Jacob and Mia drew<br/>\narrows on small pieces of paper and played treasure hunts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter lunch the boys played with their lego and Mia got out the peg boards.<br/>\nThen outside to play Lord of the Rings. They have been watching the movies<br/>\nover the last few nights.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater on we made ooblik. The kitchen cupboards turned blue and it was<br/>\neverywhere but they loved playing with it. Mark came home from work and the<br/>\nnext hour was spent with him and the boys playing air guitar to extremely<br/>\nloud music (with blue hands &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother and sister came over at 8pm to watch The Two Towers. Mark went to<br/>\nbed with Mia to tell crazy stories and the boys sat up to watch the movie<br/>\nwith us. They loved it!!! This morning they are outside pretending to be<br/>\nAragorn and Gollum. I&#39;m not sure who Mia is, she has a scarf tied around her<br/>\nwaist with a cardboard dagger tucked into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast Friday we had an Every Other Day party. The kids hadn&#39;t had birthday<br/>\nparties this year so we threw a party for the sake of it. It was fancy<br/>\ndress. We had dragons and unicorns, princesses and indians. Jess was a<br/>\nknight, Jacob was darth maul (he looked awesome) and Mia was a woodland<br/>\nfairy with a dagger (can you tell she has older brothers?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI love bringing joy into my kids lives. And it&#39;s contagious because they<br/>\nlove to do the same for me.<br/>\nMary is right. Life is good.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82774,"nextTopicId":82817}}
