I thought my son would<br/>\nlike it because he likes chess and has wanted to join a chess club (but we<br/>\ndon&#39;t live anywhere near where there is one).  He didn&#39;t want to watch the<br/>\nmovie at first, so I just turned it on to watch it myself. Shortly, the<br/>\nwhole family was in the room, and we all really enjoyed it.  I had no idea<br/>\npeople could play chess that fast!  Well, the movie inspired my daughter to<br/>\npull out the chess board, but then nobody wanted to play (it was about<br/>\nmidnight, and I don&#39;t know how to play anyway).  She ended up playing the<br/>\nLego chess game on the computer, but still has the chess set waiting for<br/>\nsomeone to play!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the recommendation!
