My five and four year old know how <br/>\nto read the word peanut, but wont eat anything unless they have cleared it <br/>\nwith me.  They understand the impact to their health.  We keep all nuts out of <br/>\nthe house and inspect everything we eat elsewhere.  To me, that&#39;s no more <br/>\nrestricting than putting yourself between your child and a car headed right towards <br/>\nhim or her.  I don&#39;t think life threatening allergies are really part of a <br/>\ndiscussion about limiting food choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have food allergies that are not severe.  Highly processed corn (corn <br/>\nsyrup, corn starch) give my kids eczema.  It might be the chemicals they use. <br/>\n They understand what happens to them, but will choose a little itching over <br/>\na lollipop most times.  They will also get tired of the lollipop after a while <br/>\nand stop licking it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have reactions to food coloring (and sometimes flavoring), it makes <br/>\nthe kids feel yucky, on-edge.  It gives my husband a headache.  We offer them <br/>\nchoices in the home that wont make them feel this way.  Any place outside the <br/>\nhouse, they make their own choices.  They know how something makes them feel, <br/>\nfor the most part.  They wont drink fruit punch, for instance because of how it <br/>\nmakes them feel.  (and the resulting eczema most of the time.)  Most <br/>\nunfamiliar foods they stay away from because of the allergies.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe strive to make none of our food making decisions judgemental.  The baggage <br/>\nof our own childhoods can make this difficult at times.  It can be a struggle <br/>\nto think of food as just food and not &quot;good&quot; food or &quot;bad&quot; food.  We let them <br/>\nmake their choices for all meals.  My daughter mostly eats apples with <br/>\nsoybean butter and my son eats pepperoni, hot dogs, toast and fruit of all sorts.  <br/>\nThey are happy and healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.  For what it&#39;s worth, the baby seems to react to a lot of <br/>\nfoods I eat, so he may have some of the same allergies as my other two.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth, back to lurking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95090,"nextTopicId":95005}}
