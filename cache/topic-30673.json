I understand you have your opinion on the contents<br/>\nof this and any other website. As far as &quot;conveniently twisting&quot; facts...I<br/>\nhope that you would also say the same about the beef industry, the dairy<br/>\nindustry (that has completely infiltrated the school system), as well as the<br/>\npork and poultry industries.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than sit here and debunk your email, I would only suggest that people<br/>\nfind out for themselves. A very good book to read regarding factory farming<br/>\nand nutritional fact is Diet for a New America, by John Robbins (of the<br/>\nBaskin-Robbins family but turned his back on the family fortune due to his<br/>\nstrong convictions). One CERTAINLY does not need to look very hard to find<br/>\nnegatives about cow&#39;s milk. They are all over the place, and I would suggest<br/>\nfurther research on the topic in order to make educated statements about<br/>\npositives or negatives regarding cow&#39;s milk.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are accusing this person of assuming that people will not double check<br/>\nhis statements and just accept it at face value. How many people accept<br/>\ncow&#39;s milk at face value? Not knowing that there is a LEGALLY ACCEPTABLE<br/>\nlevel of blood, puss, and urine in cow&#39;s milk, they just accept it at face<br/>\nvalue. After all, it does a body good, right? I&#39;m not going to waste my time<br/>\ngoing through the meat and dairy council&#39;s websites piece by piece. I don&#39;t<br/>\naccept what they say at face value, and I don&#39;t expect anyone to believe<br/>\nthings at face value and if they feel it necessary, they should do the<br/>\nresearch. This is what I would suggest to you. There are books out there by<br/>\nJohn Robbins, Neal Barnard, plenty of information from PETA, PCRM(Physicians<br/>\nCommittee for Responsible Medicine)etc. If you would really like to know<br/>\nmore about effects of dairy on the system, the information is there.

This guy makes money supposedly finding negatives about milk.  He<br/>\nputs in just enough true and facts to make it believable but most of them<br/>\nare conveniently twisted.  Take FloJo&#39;s death.  He neglects to mention that<br/>\nany meal containing meat (ie. the sausage and pepperoni on the pizza) takes<br/>\ntwice as long to digest than a vegetarian meal.  And that is just one of his<br/>\nmisinformation &quot;factoids.&quot;  He states that he personally contacted the ME&#39;s<br/>\noffice leaving, of course, the assumption that the ME spoke to him.  Doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhappen that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can go through his site piece by piece but it would take up several way to<br/>\nlong e-mails.  His assumption is that folks will not double check what he<br/>\nsays and just accept it all at face value.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Brynn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jb.pan@...\">jb.pan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 03, 2002 3:12 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] cow&#39;s milk products<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; One more quick thing....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; www.notmilk.com  a very informative website full of info you may or may<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; want to know...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Brynn  :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
