Then he left the &quot;system&quot; and,<br/>\n&gt; without a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; few years, became a proficient writer and reader, even reading<br/>\n&gt; for fun. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think a lot of it was that he now needed those skills for real<br/>\n&gt; life, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then enabled him to get through some of the blocks he&#39;d put up,<br/>\n&gt; and learn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other ways.

I think people often judge a writer based on<br/>\n&gt; grammar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and spelling. Even if a person&#39;s ideas have merit, if his writing<br/>\n&gt; is full<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of errors they&#39;re often discounted.

My dad never learned to read more<br/>\n&gt; than a road sign, and even that he had to ask his &quot;co-pilot&quot; to make<br/>\n&gt; sure.  Yet, he followed his passion for horses and became a very popular<br/>\n&gt; and successful rancher.  He had an accountant when he was single, then a<br/>\n&gt; wife with money smarts, to pay his bills.  My husband is not a very good<br/>\n&gt; reader or writer, although he can do both.  He still gets confused by a<br/>\n&gt; lot of words.  But he does well as a journeyman in the construction<br/>\n&gt; field, and as a coach.  His brother is illiterate, probably from being<br/>\n&gt; beaten by his dad when he didn&#39;t do well in school.  But my husband<br/>\n&gt; apprenticed him in the trade, and now he is completely self-sufficient<br/>\n&gt; and self employed and even has been foreman on a lot of jobs.  The reason<br/>\n&gt; my husband apprenticed him was because he was homeless after getting out<br/>\n&gt; of jail.  He was an alcoholic.  Now he&#39;s been clean and sober for over<br/>\n&gt; six years.  I&#39;ve worked for a lot of doctors who were terrible at writing<br/>\n&gt; and spelling.  There are organizations that specialize in helping people<br/>\n&gt; with dyslexia learn to read.  I&#39;m sure you could find one in your area.<br/>\n&gt; But I wouldn&#39;t do that for many years, since there is plenty of time for<br/>\n&gt; her to develop other interests right now.  Some people outgrow dyslexia.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes it is better to focus on strengths rather than on weaknesses.<br/>\n&gt; No need to waste time wearing her out on reading.  I&#39;m thinking of a<br/>\n&gt; workout.  They say to work out the smaller, easier muscles first ,<br/>\n&gt; because the biggest muscles make you tired, so do them last.  My husband<br/>\n&gt; and his siblings did not learn to read until late, and were always<br/>\n&gt; humiliated for being behind everyone else.  What would have happened if<br/>\n&gt; they had been left on their own to learn?  It couldn&#39;t have been any<br/>\n&gt; worse than it was with all the humiliation and stress of being forced to<br/>\n&gt; read in front of the class and coming home with bad grades.  My husband<br/>\n&gt; learned to read when he was seventeen and wanted to read the Bible.  My<br/>\n&gt; sister in law said that in junior high when they had to read in front of<br/>\n&gt; the class, she would count how many paragraphs before they would get to<br/>\n&gt; her turn to read out loud, and she would practice her paragraph over and<br/>\n&gt; over so she memorized it before her turn.  She didn&#39;t learn anything, she<br/>\n&gt; just put all her focus on not being humiliated.  Now, as an adult, she<br/>\n&gt; writes the most beautiful poetry and can read books without a glitch.  My<br/>\n&gt; dad lied and had friends cheat for him so he graduated.  Why not just let<br/>\n&gt; him stay out of school and play with horses, which he did anyway by<br/>\n&gt; skipping school.  Everyone has weaknesses and strengths, and we should<br/>\n&gt; focus on strengths in others.  School means nothing.  Passion means<br/>\n&gt; everything.  Grades mean nothing.  Acceptance means everything.  Okay I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; done.<br/>\n&gt; Bonni<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

My dad never learned to read more<br/>\nthan a road sign, and even that he had to ask his &quot;co-pilot&quot; to make<br/>\nsure.  Yet, he followed his passion for horses and became a very popular<br/>\nand successful rancher.  He had an accountant when he was single, then a<br/>\nwife with money smarts, to pay his bills.  My husband is not a very good<br/>\nreader or writer, although he can do both.  He still gets confused by a<br/>\nlot of words.  But he does well as a journeyman in the construction<br/>\nfield, and as a coach.  His brother is illiterate, probably from being<br/>\nbeaten by his dad when he didn&#39;t do well in school.  But my husband<br/>\napprenticed him in the trade, and now he is completely self-sufficient<br/>\nand self employed and even has been foreman on a lot of jobs.  The reason<br/>\nmy husband apprenticed him was because he was homeless after getting out<br/>\nof jail.  He was an alcoholic.  Now he&#39;s been clean and sober for over<br/>\nsix years.  I&#39;ve worked for a lot of doctors who were terrible at writing<br/>\nand spelling.  There are organizations that specialize in helping people<br/>\nwith dyslexia learn to read.  I&#39;m sure you could find one in your area. <br/>\nBut I wouldn&#39;t do that for many years, since there is plenty of time for<br/>\nher to develop other interests right now.  Some people outgrow dyslexia. <br/>\nSometimes it is better to focus on strengths rather than on weaknesses. <br/>\nNo need to waste time wearing her out on reading.  I&#39;m thinking of a<br/>\nworkout.  They say to work out the smaller, easier muscles first ,<br/>\nbecause the biggest muscles make you tired, so do them last.  My husband<br/>\nand his siblings did not learn to read until late, and were always<br/>\nhumiliated for being behind everyone else.  What would have happened if<br/>\nthey had been left on their own to learn?  It couldn&#39;t have been any<br/>\nworse than it was with all the humiliation and stress of being forced to<br/>\nread in front of the class and coming home with bad grades.  My husband<br/>\nlearned to read when he was seventeen and wanted to read the Bible.  My<br/>\nsister in law said that in junior high when they had to read in front of<br/>\nthe class, she would count how many paragraphs before they would get to<br/>\nher turn to read out loud, and she would practice her paragraph over and<br/>\nover so she memorized it before her turn.  She didn&#39;t learn anything, she<br/>\njust put all her focus on not being humiliated.  Now, as an adult, she<br/>\nwrites the most beautiful poetry and can read books without a glitch.  My<br/>\ndad lied and had friends cheat for him so he graduated.  Why not just let<br/>\nhim stay out of school and play with horses, which he did anyway by<br/>\nskipping school.  Everyone has weaknesses and strengths, and we should<br/>\nfocus on strengths in others.  School means nothing.  Passion means<br/>\neverything.  Grades mean nothing.  Acceptance means everything.

Raising my<br/>\nown children I hated how they grouped kids into grades and assembly lined<br/>\nthem through school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the sounds of what you people are doing but I do want her reading and<br/>\nwriting so she can have the ability to learn on her own.  Without starting<br/>\nany controversies or anything I was wondering if any of you who have done<br/>\nthe unschooling thing for a while (years?) would kind of give me a brief<br/>\nrun-down of how you work these things into their educations without a<br/>\nstructured type program.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would really love to find something that works for us.  Homeschooling has<br/>\nworked far better than formal schooling but this is not something we are<br/>\nentirely happy about.  Being told that it is time to sit and work in<br/>\nworkbooks is no better than the bell ringing at play time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am hoping it is not to late to teach this old dog a few new tricks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSharon<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, April 13, 2002 7:51 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Not an unschooler =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 4/13/02 6:01:21 PM Mountain Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Which reminds me, what is wrong with playing with dirt and rocks for<br/>\nweeks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at a time?  Kids with imagination build whole cities, dig caves, build<br/>\n&gt; &gt; castles with the rocks, become interested in the flora and fauna around<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them, bring far too many bugs in the house to find out what they are<br/>\n(o.k.,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so I don&#39;t like bugs in my house &lt;g&gt;), climb trees, build tree houses,<br/>\nkick<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a ball, run, jump, try doing gymnastics, ride bicycles, roller blade,<br/>\nride<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scooters, play Evil Knivel (loose two front teeth %-{ ), teach the dog<br/>\n&gt; &gt; circus tricks, make mud pies, climb fences, try to walk a tight rope,<br/>\nplay<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Robin Hood and sword fight, play with dolls, play with cars, try rubbing<br/>\ntwo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sticks together to start a camp fire, collect rocks that are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different/pretty, play Army, make a rope swing, collect flowers (I&#39;m<br/>\nrunning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out of vases to put them in and the house smells soooo good, Spring is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; here!), play house, skip rope and the list is endless.  Just plain old<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unbridled imagination and doesn&#39;t take parent coerced stimulus.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s a lot more than just sticks and rocks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If they have rope and bikes and cars, roller blades, scooters, a dog,<br/>\ntrees,<br/>\n&gt; dolls and flowers, that does give them a lot of options.  And I presume<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; parents provided those things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was never talking about &quot;parent coerced stimulus&quot; and I don&#39;t think<br/>\nanyone<br/>\n&gt; here really thought that &quot;providing opportunities and resources&quot;<br/>\ntranslates<br/>\n&gt; reasonabley to &quot;parent coerced stimulus.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If a family had no trees, flowers, bikes, cars, roller blades, scooters,<br/>\n&gt; dogs, dolls, and wouldn&#39;t let their kids play with rope or hammers, nails<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; boards, I think that family would not be providing the optimal unschooling<br/>\n&gt; environment, and if a kid had a really boring back yard, a boring<br/>\n&gt; inside-of-house, and the parent wasn&#39;t offering to take him elsewhere,<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; could do better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think leaving children to their own devices works better when the kids<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; lots of ideas, materials and support when they want it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
