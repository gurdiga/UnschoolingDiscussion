Bridget<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been reading these posts and there are some things I&#39;ve noticed.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  It seems really important to Bridget that she be called a mother that <br/>\nunschools her children.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Unschooling (as I understand it, please correct me if I&#39;m wrong) is <br/>\ndefined as letting kids choose to do what they want when they want, with us <br/>\noffering resources, things for them to do (to which they can say yes or not), <br/>\ngiving them the common courtesies we would use with our hubbies or friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  If my child (and I can only use my family as an example) Zak said to me <br/>\n&quot;I really want you to assign me some kind of writing task each week.  I&#39;ll <br/>\n(Zak) choose how much and what I write but I want you (Dawn) to hold me <br/>\naccountable for the amount that I do&quot;.... I would want to have a conversation <br/>\nwith him about why he felt the need to have someone else direct and dictate <br/>\nhis life rather than himself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example.  If my best friend Debra called and said &quot;I need you to <br/>\nwrite an article for my local newspaper this week, you can write it on <br/>\nanything you want and it can be as long as you want, but it has to be done in <br/>\nthe next 7 days&quot;.... I then have the choice to say yes or no to that <br/>\nassignment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think for me it&#39;s the idea that a child would willingly come to me and say <br/>\n&quot;I want you to tell me to do something&quot; seems odd.  Maybe it&#39;s because my <br/>\nchild has not been to school long enough (only to 1 week in Kindgergarten, <br/>\nWaldorf Style which is more like preschool) that he&#39;s not interested in me <br/>\nassigning him anything.  It&#39;s hard enough to get his attention most of the <br/>\ntime to offer things he does like, let alone get him to want me to dictate to <br/>\nhim what he does!!!!  (Sorry that was a long sentence).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be concerned about Zak&#39;s self esteem and what had happened to him to <br/>\nmake him rely on me &quot;making him accountable&quot; for writing or math, especially <br/>\nas I&#39;m working towards being as radical an unschooler as possible (nothing <br/>\nlike going whole hog).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nDawn Falbe  <br/>\nPersonal Development Coach<br/>\nRelocational Astrologer<br/>\n(520) 579-2646<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nThe Path of Least Resistance is Inside of You<br/>\nwww.astrologerdawn.com<br/>\nEnlightening women on how to live their Soul Purpose<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The people who get on in this world<br/>\n are people who get up and look for the<br/>\n circumstances they want, and, <br/>\nif they can&#39;t find them, make them.&quot; - George Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school.&quot;-George <br/>\nBernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25062,"nextTopicId":25066}}
