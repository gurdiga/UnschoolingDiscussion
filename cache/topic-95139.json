But I&#39;m also thinking that a <br/>\nchild overeating (not through anything the parents have taught it) is <br/>\nnot outside the range of possibilities. A few years back, we had a <br/>\ndog that would overeat, which was always so surprising to me. With <br/>\nall of the other dogs I&#39;ve ever had in my life, you could put a big <br/>\nbowl of food out, and they would just eat as much as they needed to, <br/>\nbut this dog just didn&#39;t seem to have any internal shut-off <br/>\nmechanism. She would literally eat herself sick. We also had to pick <br/>\nup all the green apples that fell off of our apple tree because she <br/>\nwould eat *those* until she got really sick to her stomach. She would <br/>\neat blackberries too, picking them off with her teeth. I&#39;ve only met <br/>\none other dog like that, and this other one is worse. It eats rocks <br/>\nand other weird stuff. Just as with these dogs, I do think that <br/>\noccasionally, from time to time, it&#39;s possible for people to exist <br/>\nwho just don&#39;t have whatever it takes to regulate their eating. <br/>\nPeople are also born without eyes or legs, or the ability to speak, <br/>\nor whatever, so I can&#39;t imagine it would be impossible. Unlikely yes, <br/>\nimpossible no. I think it&#39;s important to remember that all the advice <br/>\non this list is just anecdotal - it&#39;s what works with our kids, it&#39;s <br/>\nwhat we&#39;ve seen and what we describe from our personal experience. It <br/>\nwill most likely work with most kids out there. I&#39;m not convinced <br/>\nthat any one piece of advice will work for everyone. It&#39;s quite <br/>\npossible that there are kids out there who will not self-regulate <br/>\ntheir eating. I&#39;ve never met one, but it&#39;s totally possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Controlling Food and TV and whatever...","postDate":"1086536191","msgId":95273,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjZS4yMmU5YTA4Mi4yZGY0OTNmZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":95266,"nextInTopic":95275,"prevInTime":95272,"nextInTime":95274,"topicId":95139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/6/04 7:15:31 AM, jrossedd@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1673611325\">In a message dated 6/6/04 7:15:31 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrossedd@...\">jrossedd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;     The Summit on Obesity this week called this response evolutionary - <br/>\nprogrammed into us as a species for prehistoric survival.

I said that I could do that, but some people would get their food before others, because of cooking times and available pots.  I also said that there may be some mornings when I won&#39;t feel like cooking so many different things.  They understood.  Stella wanted boiled eggs and didn&#39;t want any hot cereal with it.  Annie wanted hot cereal alone.  Sarah and I both wanted poached eggs on toast.  Evan, the baby who is 1 today, had a combination of all--some cereal, an egg yolk and a bit of toast.  It was fun to be able to give everyone what they wanted, and when I started to feel overwhelmed with all their choices (and my worries that it would be like this every morning), I brought myself back to the moment by breathing.  It worked amazingly well, and I stayed connected with everyone and with what I was doing.  Amazingly everything came out perfectly, AND I even thought of ways to make it easier in the future (putting more eggs in to boil, in case someone else wanted one now or tomorrow morning for example.)  Stella ended up wanting hot cereal too after I had already finished making only enough for Annie and the baby (after asking her if she wanted some too), and I told her that she could have a couple of bites of Evan&#39;s, and I could make her some for another meal, but I wouldn&#39;t make more at that moment, because I was already feeding Evan and juggling the other meals that were still cooking.  She seemed okay with that. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Maybe in the future you could ask Sarah and even Stella for a hand getting the stuff ready? <br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78615010,"authorName":"mamaaj2000","from":"&quot;mamaaj2000&quot; &lt;mamaaj2000@...&gt;","profile":"mamaaj2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Controlling Food and TV and whatever...","postDate":"1086377808","msgId":95154,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5cWowZytsbDEwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxNTQwMWM0NGE2NiQyZTE2MDA5MCQzMWFlY2VkMUBoZXJvbm9mZmljZT4="},"prevInTopic":95139,"nextInTopic":95158,"prevInTime":95153,"nextInTime":95155,"topicId":95139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... whatever she wants, whenever she wants, because I need to be able to plan meals and meet the needs of all of us.

I was so happy to find these when I got up this morning.  A lightbulb is coming on and I can see that I need to take a leap of faith with regards to my children and the choices they need to be able to make for themselves.  I get the bicycle analogy.  I won&#39;t know until I just let go, give it more than a try and see what happens with my children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to respond to some of the posts in more detail, but my children are up and need me to be with them, so that will have to wait until I have more time.  I do have so many questions in my head, but I will try to try things first instead of asking you, &quot;what if&quot; questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do want to tell you about this morning--I&#39;m pleased with the way the morning is going, although I do have some questions in my mind as a result of the way I handled things today.  (Also I want to tell you of some successes!)  Stella, my 4 yo, got up and after cruising the kitchen said, &quot;Mommy, why are those chocolate chip cookies on the counter?&quot;  (This is her round about way to getting to &quot;Can I have one?&quot;  I think.)  I answered, &quot;Because Sarah (the 10 year old) and I ate some last night and I didn&#39;t put them away.&quot;  Stella  didn&#39;t say anything, but I could see that she wanted one, but was resisting asking because she thought I would tell her (in possibly an annoyed voice), &quot;Stella, you need to eat something healthy first before eating snack food like this.  Let&#39;s have breakfast first.&quot;  or something to that effect.  Because I could see that she wanted one, I said, &quot;You look like you&#39;d like one of those.&quot;  She nodded vigorously.  I said, &quot;Go ahead.  Would you like something else, too, or just cookies?&quot;  She thought about that for awhile and said she wanted &quot;regular breakfast stuff too.&quot;  I asked her what she wanted for breakfast.  She wanted cereal, and I knew that she meant cold, boxed cereal that we seldom have in the house.  I said, &quot;We only have hot cereal in the house today.  Is that okay?&quot;  She said &quot;yes,&quot; but I remembered that she had been asking for boiled eggs alot lately, but noone else wanted them, so I haven&#39;t made any.  I said, &quot;oh, I could also make boiled eggs if you want.&quot;  At first she said no, but then decided she wanted boiled eggs and no cereal.  I said okay and she ate a cookie, then she asked for another cookie.  I said, &quot;Yes, if you are still hungry for a cookie.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow here I have a couple of questtions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1-  How do I subtly let her know the choice is hers, and that I&#39;m not controlling that choice.  She is so used to asking me first, and so am I, because I have been the controlling authority.  If I am really giving her control over what she eats, then she should just be able to go and eat cookies anytime.  Right? So should I say to her,  Which leads to another problem for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n2-  I am on a very limited income right now and I have 4 children and myself to feed, and then my husband when he is here on the weekends.
