Before","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-644881285\">Hi all, my name is Linda Maggioncalda and I have been reading the<br/>\nlist for a couple of weeks and have enjoyed it thoroughly and have <br/>\nlearned so much.  Before that I was reading on Unschooling.com.  My <br/>\nhusband Eugene and I have 2 daughters, Sarah (6) and Olivia (3.5).  <br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading everything I can find about unschooling for the <br/>\npast year (SandraDodd.com!!!!)and this wonderful way of living and <br/>\nlearning works well for our family.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis story is about our recent visit with our niece and is long and <br/>\ninvolved and I will write it in installments.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTen days ago our 14 year old schooled niece, Noelle, walked in<br/>\nto this peaceful scene to stay with us for two weeks as a &quot;mother&#39;s <br/>\nhelper.&quot;  This was arranged by Noelle&#39;s mother who told me that it<br/>\nwas Noelle&#39;s idea and that Noelle was really looking forward to it. (<br/>\nBTW, both of Noelle&#39;s parents work full time and Noelle has always <br/>\ngone to school. She will be in the 9th grade in the fall.)  We live <br/>\nin Alexandria, Virginia and Noelle flew in from Detroit to be with <br/>\nus.  My girls were very excited about their older cousin&#39;s visit.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoelle seemed to have trouble right away with our lifestyle and kept <br/>\ntrying to coerce and even force the girls to do things such as get <br/>\nready for bed, get dressed, eat.  I explained our parenting<br/>\nphilosophy--which she seemed unable to understand. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe second day Noelle was here, as we were driving along in the car <br/>\nshe told me that my children needed to go school and that they <br/>\nneeded to be with other children.  I explained that we were with <br/>\nother children plenty.  And she said, &quot;Yes, but they need to be with <br/>\nother children without you.&quot;  I disagreed and said I thought they <br/>\nneeded to be with me and she said, &quot;Children don&#39;t need their <br/>\nparents.&quot;  She then told me that I shouldn&#39;t homeschool them past <br/>\nthe third grade. I challenged her to open her mind to different ways <br/>\nof doing things and offered the &quot;Teen Liberation Handbook&quot; (by Grace <br/>\nLlewellyn) for her to read.  She refused.  I then told her that I <br/>\nplanned to homeschool them as long as they wanted to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNoelle also said some rude and disrespectful things to me throughout <br/>\nthe day.  By the time my husband got home I was seething.  He talked <br/>\nwith her (she is his older brother&#39;s daughter).  He told her gently <br/>\nbut firmly that we don&#39;t talk to each other that way in our house.  <br/>\nNoelle apologized and we seemed to have forgiveness and good <br/>\nfeelings all around.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNoelle came to me later and said, &quot;I know I have an attitude problem <br/>\nand I&#39;m trying to change.&quot;  She then said that junior high was a <br/>\nreally mean place and she understood a little of why I <br/>\nhomeschooled.  She said, &quot;You don&#39;t want Sarah and Olivia to be a <br/>\nmean girl like me.&quot;  I asked her, &quot;Are you a mean girl?&quot; &quot;No, I&#39;m <br/>\nnot but junior high is so mean.&quot;  I said that was one reason I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant them to go there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEnd of first installment.  Next, we go to Bible School and Noelle is <br/>\nfurther challenged by our unschooling lifestyle.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107310,"nextTopicId":107325}}
