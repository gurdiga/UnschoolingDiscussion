Before that, I was quilting.  My dh helped me <br/>\ngrocery shop today, took our 13yo, 15yo and a friend of theirs <br/>\nto &quot;Scary movie night&quot; being hosted by some of our cousins.  Dh has <br/>\nalso spent some time today removing a windsheild from one of our <br/>\nvehicles in hopes that tomorrow will be warm enough to glue a <br/>\ndifferent windshield on a car that will need to pass inspection <br/>\nsoon.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDd, 15yo is currently at the aboved mentioned party, but spent her <br/>\nday online, reading (Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants)and watching <br/>\ncartoons and music videos.  She is also relishing some of the last <br/>\nhours spent with a girlfriend that has been visiting this past week <br/>\nfrom across the state.  This girlfriend is 16yo, got pissed at some <br/>\ngirls bullying her in school last year, walked out and never <br/>\nreturned.  She already has her GED and plans to start college in the <br/>\nfall.  Thus, she is currently available to visit with us for long <br/>\nperiods of time, as long as we agree to meet her mom at a halfway <br/>\npoint 3 hours away!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 13yo loves to play with and babysit my grandson, so she spent time <br/>\nwith him today as well as watching videos and cartoons and getting <br/>\nready for the party tonight (she primps more than the 15yo).  Oh!  <br/>\nAnd my 23yo who is still home and the mom of the aforementioned <br/>\ngrandson, she hurt her neck early this morning, so by afternoon was <br/>\nasking me to take her to the emergency room.  She got some great <br/>\ndrugs into her system (she felt much better) and offered to make <br/>\nsupper.  She also fussed and cussed at her fiance&#39; over a round of <br/>\nMario Cart while I bathed my grandbaby for her.  He is so CUTE!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, this went all over the map, but life is hectic, and I love it!<br/>\n<br/>\nSally</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111223,"nextTopicId":55279}}
