Denise &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Denise,<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are interested in the terms and definitions and so the discussion <br/>\nis useful to them. I personally find it very fascinating. To each her own it <br/>\nseems.  If you are finding a particular thread irritating you, there could be <br/>\ntwo ways to handle it. The first option would be to simply delete anything to <br/>\ndo with that thread. For myself, I find when something is irritating me, it <br/>\nis an opportunity to learn more about myself because the situation is a <br/>\nmirror for me. I have attracted something in my life as a learning <br/>\nopportunity. Also, if there is something specific about unschooling you wish <br/>\nto talk about, please feel free to bring it up for discussion. And welcome to <br/>\nthe list.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving in Abundance<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32708,"nextTopicId":32787}}
