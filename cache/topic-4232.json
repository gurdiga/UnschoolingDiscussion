There is plenty of time<br/>\nto become acquainted with the various faces of evil in this world.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink preschoolers necessarily need to do this.  However, for what it&#39;s<br/>\nworth, I find that their programming options are VERY entertaining for<br/>\nthem, and there is always a &quot;problem&quot; to be solved in the storyline without<br/>\nthe use of violence or evil characters.  Frankly I would rather they learn<br/>\nto solve more realistic problems in ways which use their intellect and<br/>\ntalents than to think that everything is black and white, good and evil and<br/>\nmust be solved physically with violence and weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some examples:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Dragon Tales:  For those of you not familiar with the show, it centers<br/>\non two American children of Hispanic descent, Emmy and Max.  They have<br/>\nfound a magic dragon scale and use it to wish themselves into the land of<br/>\ndragons on a regular basis where they play with their young dragon friends.<br/>\n On a recent episode they met a near sighted Unicorn who had lost her<br/>\nglasses.  The rest of the show focused on the two kids and their dragon<br/>\npals helping &quot;Eunice&quot; to find her glasses using reasoning, problem solving<br/>\nand retracing her path.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn another episode, Max was frustrated with being little and not being able<br/>\nto do the things that he wanted to.  In the course of the story his angry<br/>\ntantrum released a trouble making imp who thrived on Max&#39;s anger and grew<br/>\nin size (and trouble) each time Max lost his temper.  Max had to learn to<br/>\nreign in his temper and express his frustration in a more constructive way,<br/>\nlike using that energy and determination to figure out how to accomplish<br/>\nhis goals.  In this was the imp shrank and they were able to recapture him<br/>\nin the seed pod from which he came.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another episode, the kids and dragons were building a tree house and<br/>\nEmmy wanted everyone to do things her way, and was hurting everyone&#39;s<br/>\nfeelings by not listening to them.  She had to discover that to work<br/>\ntogether, everyone has to have their voice heard and be able to have a hand<br/>\nin the finished product.  She learned to back off and let the others<br/>\ncontribute to the project, even if they didn&#39;t do things exactly the way<br/>\nshe would have, because they each had their own special gifts and talents<br/>\nto bring to the tree house construction that were just as special as hers.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Little Bear:  In one episode Little Bear meets a new friend, No Feet<br/>\nthe garden snake, and sets about discovering what kind of a bed No Feet<br/>\nwould like.  He tries all different places in his bedroom, but the drawer<br/>\nis too dark, the shelf too high, the plant pot too small, and so on.<br/>\nFinally they decide that his best bed is in the garden where Little Bear<br/>\nfound him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another episode Little Bear sets off exploring in the forest, a<br/>\nrecurring theme, with some of his friends and has many adventures along the<br/>\nway, and meets some new friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another Little Bear episode, he and his best friend Emily try to make<br/>\nsome cupcakes &quot;just like Mother Bear makes.&quot;  After including everything<br/>\nbut the kitchen sink in the cupcakes, they come out of the oven not quite<br/>\nright.  With some help from Mother Bear, who tells the story of her first<br/>\ncupcakes and how they were not quite right either, they discover they have<br/>\nleft out a key ingredient, the baking powder!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou get the idea.  The stories are interesting, fun and entertaining,<br/>\nwithout the use of villians as a story device.  I find that plot line<br/>\nrather tired and boring anyway.  It&#39;s an overused device.  Anyway they do<br/>\nwatch and love a number of Disney films, which use the villian story device<br/>\nalmost exclusively.  I don&#39;t think that they need to see evil characters or<br/>\nviolent story lines in their every day entertainment.  Once in a while in<br/>\ntheir Disney movies is more than enough for me.  I find that boys have a<br/>\nnatural tendancy towards more agressive behavior and if I want them to<br/>\nlearn to express themselves in other ways I want their regular<br/>\nentertainment to be non-agressive in nature.  It seems to be working so<br/>\nfar, as I have two polite, affectionate little boys who do not regularly<br/>\n&quot;play fight,&quot; choose weapons as playthings, or know what a G-U-N is.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Marbleface@xxx.xxx","from":"Marbleface@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"-ahQ6DymKotk1rGaoTHhGuUJT7J_96mc-yfCGeihwyaIqK_OxVuohZzwjeTCPveBrOyNfn0ehjLL","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Little Bear","postDate":"942069719","msgId":4332,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yODcuNDMzMi45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4330,"nextInTopic":4345,"prevInTime":4331,"nextInTime":4333,"topicId":4232,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/8/99 1:51:10 PM !!!First Boot!!!, jhawthorne@home.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-811417388\">In a message dated 11/8/99 1:51:10 PM !!!First Boot!!!, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhawthorne@...\">jhawthorne@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; <br/>\n There&#39;s lots of time to come to grips with evil...but the shallow, cartoon,<br/>\n television fictional evil seems a lousy introduction.

I was just confused about how Little Bear could have a<br/>\nnegative IS mentality, when there is no &quot;schooling&quot; in it.  I was just<br/>\nbewildered by the comments about &quot;a day in the life of&quot; and school issues<br/>\nconfusing unschooled chilren when you were talking about Little Bear.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree about Franklin, though.  The one mom at the playgroup that I<br/>\nquit who I thought might be a good friend has made some comments that<br/>\nraised my eyebrows on various occassions about sending her preschooler to<br/>\nprivate school, about movies they watch or the plethora of toys that they<br/>\nown/buy, etc.  But one I remember in particular is her praise for Franklin.<br/>\n I can&#39;t stand Franklin for my unschooling children, as almost every<br/>\nepisode includes a mention of or a focus on school.  Barney is another with<br/>\na focus on schooling, as the whole set consists of the school and the<br/>\nschoolyard, where all of the shows take place.<br/>\n<br/>\nPreschool Shows that we enjoy:<br/>\n<br/>\nPBS: Dragon Tales, Sesame Street, Zaboomafoo<br/>\n<br/>\nDiseny Channel: Out of the Box, Bear in the Big Blue House, Winnie the Pooh<br/>\n<br/>\nNickelodeon Jr.: Blue&#39;s Clues, Little Bear, Gullah Gullah Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Joel Hawthorne","from":"Joel Hawthorne &lt;jhawthorne@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"2fXdfVlXZ5nrGg1jxgDcCf_rmQSjCC6BC6yOzAsORuQMuhiDR57NbRJHHGI2aFaUUSEhcd427z2di4jd2_r9y0TKJeZfRHQBiOJE","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Little Bear","postDate":"941810428","msgId":4234,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yODIuNDIzNC45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4232,"nextInTopic":4242,"prevInTime":4233,"nextInTime":4235,"topicId":4232,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How about Arthur for revolting? ... -- best wishes Joel For a wonderful gift possibility and to support a great cause check out: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-43666035\">How about &quot;Arthur&quot; for revolting?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrooke T Patten wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Brooke T Patten &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:babypatten@...\">babypatten@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I Love Little Bear!
