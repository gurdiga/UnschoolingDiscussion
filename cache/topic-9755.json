What bothers me are those women and families who obviously don&#39;t think their lives should change once children are in the picture, who &quot;need&quot; to keep working so they can have a second BMW or who would go &quot;crazy&quot; sitting around all day with their children. Everything is what you make of it. And if you go into motherhood thinking you&#39;re just going to sit around with your kids all day, than you will. Parenting is such a selfless job, and those parents who put themselves first instead of their children are the ones that really get to me.<br>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote><br>\n</blockquote>-- <br>\nAmy Nelson<br>\nMama to Accalia (6/14/99)<br>\n&quot;The hardest to learn was the least complicated.&quot; - The Indigo Girls <br>\n<blockquote><tt><br>\nSomeone said they believed &quot;mothers should mother.&quot; Well, right now my <br>\nhusband is home with our kids and his small home-based business (which would <br>\nnot put food on our table).

If you don&#39;t have a choice to pursue outside vocations, <br/>\nthen staying home is just being trapped. If you do have choices, then <br/>\nstaying home is a free decision and an affirmation of your beliefs. Also, <br/>\nthere is such a thing as having to earn money for the family (&quot;What would <br/>\nyou do if money didn&#39;t matter&quot; can be quite unrealistic, when it does). It <br/>\nis unfair to suggest that people who use day care per se don&#39;t love their <br/>\nchildren as much or aren&#39;t as fit parents as people who stay home with them. <br/>\nThat&#39;s a line of reasoning that ultimately dehumanizes people who simply do <br/>\nthings differently. In a related thread, we have been lamenting the loss of <br/>\nfriendships since we&#39;ve made the decision to have kids, or to home school. <br/>\nWell, people drift apart for many reasons, but faced with a judgmental <br/>\nattitude, yes, friendships go sour.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone said they believed &quot;mothers should mother.&quot; Well, right now my <br/>\nhusband is home with our kids and his small home-based business (which would <br/>\nnot put food on our table).
