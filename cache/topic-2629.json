Lovely people and all that.  I guess I was comparing it <br/>\nto the SCA, not Walmart.  In the SCA you can get years of martial instruction <br/>\nand almost any kind of craft instruction you want also, scot free.  I do <br/>\ncalligraphy and illumination in the SCA, and the work is given to the kingdom <br/>\nand then given to award recipients to commemorate their service.

I am probably a complete curmudgeon, and frankly, my budget is <br/>\nmore in the rummage sale range than even Walmart&#39;s, so I find county fairs <br/>\nand craft shows and all manner of things too commercial.  But, if I have to <br/>\npay a substantial entrance fee to something, I want workshops and activities, <br/>\nnot sales booths, (&#39;cause getting in has left me broke),  and things to <br/>\npassively observe. The renfaires seem to fill a niche in the world and <br/>\nentertain people at large very nicely, which is well and good, and they do <br/>\nprovide a living for good craftspeople and performers.  But, if you want to <br/>\nlearn to make your own hat, or stop rolling dice to see whether your <br/>\ncharacter beats another in a fight, the SCA is there and people will show you <br/>\nhow to do everything they know without any money changing hands.<br/>\n<br/>\n Karen, (with Helen, 6, Agent of Chaos, and Gordon, 3, Agent of Destruction)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Thomas and Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Thomas and Nanci Kuykendall &lt;tn-k4of5@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"XYPuczp9uLA-kOoIBZlbTWvy-rqMko-O5OWaNkQZWL5sd-Cnrjvau1KIx2ZWtd8R_vShbMUGtvLdZzV2Asqiz7ktQHZhNC5MC58k1tKJOObFHn36pVWPuHs","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: What is the SCA...","postDate":"936662601","msgId":2651,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xOTEuMjY1MS45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2643,"nextInTopic":2652,"prevInTime":2650,"nextInTime":2652,"topicId":2629,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
