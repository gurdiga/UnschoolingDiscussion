I laughed, but later her hubby told me she was serious. <br/>\nI told him I had already smudged their house, he had no clue as to what that <br/>\nmeant, but was thrilled that I love them enough to be proactive!

They were always my favourites. The kids (my two older boys Jeremy and Justin, both 12) were, shall we say, less than thrilled. It DID serve to open up a discussion about good vs. evil, God vs. Satan, etc., as well as a short discussion about the Catholic faith and it&#39;s shortcomings (we are non-practising Catholics). They certainly weren&#39;t scared, though. Too much &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;-type desensitization, I think. They expect gore and graphic violence. They didn&#39;t &#39;get&#39; the original &quot;Psycho&quot; until I explained that it was made in such a way that the viewer&#39;s mind did the scaring, rather than the action on the screen. &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and any of the other original horror flicks did nothing close to scaring them. <br/>\nThey were marginally impressed with &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;, although I wasn&#39;t.

Its fun!&quot; or they will act out the Abby Normal <br/>\nscene, among others &lt;g&gt; I don&#39;t think they quite understand the double meaning <br/>\nyet, but that&#39;s okay, it is funny to hear a 7 year old say &quot;What Knockers&quot; and <br/>\nhear a 9 year old say &quot;Oh, Doctor.&quot; right in the middle of the grocery <br/>\nstore!) we also like to watch Twilight Zone. (the old ones) Horror flicks from the <br/>\n70&#39;s are great fun to watch as well. Some we like are; Nosferatu the Vampyre, <br/>\nHalloween, Dracula, Zombie, The Stepford Wives, Grizzly, The Terror of <br/>\nFrankenstein, Lady Frankstein, The Monster Walks, Monster from a Prehistoric Planet... <br/>\nSome of those might not be what a 5 year old is looking for though. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe like The Creature from the Black Lagoon, and Godzilla movies are good. <br/>\nOthers we like are Hitchcock movies like The Man Who Knew too Much with Peter <br/>\nLorre. Boris Karloff&#39;s movies; Frankenstein, Mummy, The Tower of London, and <br/>\nFrankenstein from 1970 are all good. The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Abominable <br/>\nDr. Phibes, The Return of Dr. X, all good.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers include; The Blob (both versions, one with Steve McQueen and the 1988 <br/>\nversion with Kevin Dillon) Bug (1975), Jaws, It (not the Steven King book <br/>\nturned movie, the movie staring Roddy McDowell from 1967) The Adventures of <br/>\nBuckaroo Banzi Across the Eighth Dimension (Peter Weller, Jeff Goldboom, Jon <br/>\nLithgow, Christopher Lloyd, 1984?), Braindead, The Dark Crystal, Bats, don&#39;t forget <br/>\nThe Birds (another Hitchcock movie), King Kong (1933), Journey to the Center of <br/>\nthe Earth, An American Werewolf in London (1981), Creepshow, The Howling, <br/>\nDune, Jason and the Argonauts, Planet of the Apes movies, The Thing from Another <br/>\nWorld, Them!, War of the Worlds, Village of the Damned (1960 version), <br/>\nGremlins, Willow, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, any or all three Quatermass movies, <br/>\nScreamers, Dr. Who and the Daleks, and the sequel, Invasion Earth 2150 AD, <br/>\nStarship Troopers, Journey to the Center of the Earth. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on and on! &lt;g&gt; You might wonder why I list some of these, but all <br/>\nhave an element of Monster, Alien, Mutant Bug...  I think most are worth a <br/>\nlook, even though some, like Willow aren&#39;t really part of the &quot;Horror&quot; genre. <br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Viewing! <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone has talent.
