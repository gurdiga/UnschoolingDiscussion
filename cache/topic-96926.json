The name of our group is &quot;Dragontree <br/>\nHomelearners&quot; so I thought it was pretty obvious we were homeschoolers, <br/>\nbut the judge just didn&#39;t get it.  He said to the kids &quot;ok, you guys <br/>\nknow when you are in school and you only get 50 out of 100 points on a <br/>\ntest, and that&#39;s bad in school?&quot;  The kids just looked at him with blank <br/>\nexpressions.  The guy tried again &quot;you know in school, if you only get <br/>\nhalf the points on a test, then you failed the test...&quot;  The kids were <br/>\nstill looking at him as though he was talking a strange language.  The <br/>\nteam leader finally said &quot;they don&#39;t go to school, they don&#39;t take <br/>\ntests, they are homeschooled.&quot;  The man looked really confused and then <br/>\nsaid &quot;they don&#39;t take tests?&quot;  This was obviously an amazing fact to <br/>\nhim, how could any child reach age 9 and not understand or take tests?  <br/>\nSo he then tried again with the kids &quot;ok, on a test, if you only get 50 <br/>\nquestions right out of 100, then...&quot;  I spoke up and said something like <br/>\n&quot;they don&#39;t take tests, they are homeschooled.&quot;  If he had just said <br/>\n&quot;normally 50% is not good but in DI it is very good&quot; the kids would have <br/>\ngotten that immediately, but instead he was trying to relate this to <br/>\nschool and testing and none of the three kids involved had ever been to <br/>\nschool, besides preschool, and didn&#39;t understand at all.  He finally did <br/>\nexplain the scores to the kids and to us, but every few minutes he would <br/>\nlook at the adults with a very strange look and say something like &quot;they <br/>\ndon&#39;t take tests?&quot;  or &quot;they don&#39;t have to go to school?&quot;  On the way <br/>\nback to the hotel the kids and I discussed percentages, and all three of <br/>\nthem very much understood percentages, but didn&#39;t understand 50% being <br/>\nbad or failing.

He had an<br/>\ninterview with<br/>\n&gt; one of the admissions people and was asked about his educational<br/>\nbackground. This<br/>\n&gt; school has admitted lots of homeschoolers so they were familiar with<br/>\nhomeschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son, though, asks, &quot;Have you ever heard of unschooling?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Admissions lady says, &quot;No.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So my son proceeds to explain it like this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;My mom traditionally homeschooled me for most of my life. But then she<br/>\nstarted a<br/>\n&gt; business a few years ago. She got overwhelmed with homeschool so she<br/>\ndecided to<br/>\n&gt; unschool where we can do whatever we want in order to learn whatever we<br/>\nwant.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He was then asked what he had learned and he told her that he couldn&#39;t<br/>\nremember<br/>\n&gt; anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What?!?!?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the debrief with me, I reminded him that I&#39;ve had my business for five<br/>\nyears and that it<br/>\n&gt; had nothing to do with changing to unschooling. Secondly I asked him what<br/>\nhe meant<br/>\n&gt; when he said he hadn&#39;t learned much or couldn&#39;t remember anything! This is<br/>\nthe Klingon<br/>\n&gt; speaking, guitar and piano playing, book reading, computer programming,<br/>\nShakespeare<br/>\n&gt; performing, sign language skilled kid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, boiled down it turns out that when put in a &quot;schoolish&quot; context he<br/>\njust couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; understand how to explain us or his learning. He did say that once the<br/>\nconversation got<br/>\n&gt; going, her found himself sharing lots of good that had come of our<br/>\neducational style citing<br/>\n&gt; books and history we had studied together as well as mentioning some of<br/>\nthe above. it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; just that he didn&#39;t think that was what she wanted to hear.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It made me conscious of how important it is to give our kids language to<br/>\nexpress what we<br/>\n&gt; do when asked by school type people. I thought I had done that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Apparently not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone else have stories like this one? How do your kids expalin<br/>\nunschooling?

He has no particular <br/>\nacademic requirements for graduation - just that they are ready to move <br/>\non. One of the ways they can earn a diploma is to write an essay.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to post his description of what he suggests including in the <br/>\nessay, because Julie&#39;s post about her son and the college admissions <br/>\nquestions made me think that these might be very useful points for <br/>\nunschoolers to prepare to talk about for college admissions. Wes&#39;s <br/>\nwebsite has more information - he is a STRONG supporter of unschooling <br/>\nand has been an amazing source of inspiration and strength to countless <br/>\nteenagers and their parents.<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.cruzio.com/~beachhi/home.html\">http://members.cruzio.com/~beachhi/home.html</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are his essay instructions:<br/>\n<br/>\nInclude in your essay the following:<br/>\n\t• \tYour past educational experience. This can begin with the utterance <br/>\nof your first word, with a description of your wonderful fifth grade <br/>\nteacher or your terrible eighth grade English teacher, with an account <br/>\nof a trip to Australia, or at any other point in your life. It should <br/>\ninclude those parts of your education that you think are the important <br/>\nones; they can be experiences in school and/or outside of it, they <br/>\ncertainly don&#39;t have to be limited to the narrow academic areas that <br/>\nschool deals with, and they can be positive and/or negative.<br/>\n\t• \tYour goals for the next few years. You do not have to have a lot of <br/>\nspecific plans, but to the extent you do I&#39;d like to read about them.<br/>\n\t• \tYour skills. There used to be sections here on reading and math, <br/>\nbut I&#39;ve come to the point where I believe there are more important <br/>\nskills. To successfully get on with your life, you need to be able to <br/>\nseek out necessary information, deal with people you encounter, and set <br/>\nup opportunities for yourself through planning, job interviews, college <br/>\napplications, and so on. Reading and arithmetic at a very basic level <br/>\nare important for everyone, but only as two skills among many. As I was <br/>\nthinking about writing this section, it occurred to me that food <br/>\nhandling is more important than math; if you don&#39;t know which foods to <br/>\nput in the refrigerator, you might kill yourself. Reading and <br/>\nmathematics--especially reading--do take on added importance if you <br/>\nwant a lot of formal academic education. Please write something about <br/>\nthe degree to which you possess each skill listed above in bold type, <br/>\nand any special difficulties you may have (learning &quot;disabilities,&quot; <br/>\netc.). Also, write about any special skills you believe you have.<br/>\n\t• \tYour emotional sturdiness. Of all the characteristics that will <br/>\nmake you successful, I believe that emotional sturdiness is most <br/>\nimportant, and that self-knowledge and confidence are two vital <br/>\ncomponents of this. If you are clear about what you are capable of <br/>\ndoing and are confident of your success in your chosen endeavors, you <br/>\nwill be successful. Do you feel you do know your own capabilities well? <br/>\nAre you confident in yourself? Are there any emotional issues in your <br/>\nlife that are problematic? Can you deal with these issues?<br/>\n\t• \tYour passions. What do you do that allows you to concentrate fully, <br/>\nto become completely absorbed, to lose track of time and all your <br/>\nworries? Sing? Hike alone in the woods? Volunteer at an animal shelter? <br/>\nPlay chess? Throw pots? Write poems?<br/>\n\t• \tYour intelligences. Read the section titled Seeing Your <br/>\nIntelligence before you write about this. What activities do you engage <br/>\nin that allow you most fully to express yourself? The same question can <br/>\nbe asked this way: How do you demonstrate your strongest intelligences? <br/>\nAre they related to your passions? Did you get to use them fully in <br/>\nschool? Did the fact that school typically focuses only on the use of <br/>\nwords and numbers cause problems for you?<br/>\n\t• \tAny specific life experiences you&#39;ve had that have enabled you to <br/>\ngrow into a more mature, stronger, wiser, more knowledgeable, and more <br/>\naccomplished person: working, learning to set tile, traveling, living <br/>\nthrough a divorce, caring for a sick family member, becoming an <br/>\naccomplished dancer, facing a tough life issue, etc. Again, don&#39;t limit <br/>\nyourself to the narrow academic concerns of traditional schooling.<br/>\n\t• \tAnd, finally, why you deserve a diploma. Be very specific and <br/>\ndetailed about this. Make it very clear why you&#39;re finished with high <br/>\nschool and, in a concrete way, tell me what you&#39;re going to do next and <br/>\nhow you&#39;re going to get started. You don&#39;t have to have elaborate <br/>\nplans--just a direction and a starting point.<br/>\n  It isn&#39;t appropriate to write, “I deserve a diploma because I want  <br/>\none.” You deserve a diploma if you have the interests, talents, skills, <br/>\n  and confidence to move on with your life beyond high school.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo not believe that your life isn&#39;t interesting or valuable enough to <br/>\nwrite about. There will never be a valedictorian at Beach High School <br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t believe there is any possible way to decide that one <br/>\nset of accomplishments is more significant than another. Many BHS <br/>\nstudents who have written essays have won awards and scholarships, <br/>\ntraveled extensively, or reached high goals at a young age.

But when asked why he&#39;s not in school, depending on the person asking, he sometimes responds with:<br/>\n <br/>\nI am autodidact (said while assuming a karate type pose and pronounced as if he is about to do battle). It&#39;s hard to explain, but it is funny. People never understand it, even when he says the word correctly. He explains what we do as autodidactal learning. He made that word up and likes it better than autodidactic, so that&#39;s the one he uses. No one knows the difference.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe run into people all the time asking what grade he&#39;s in or what curriculum we use. He tells them we don&#39;t do grades and we use whatever we want. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s when they ask me that there is a problem. I know what I&#39;m doing, but can&#39;t seem to explain it for the life of me. I always come off sounding like an idiot, unless I can take time and describe some of the learning experiences that occur.

I was thinking<br/>\nalong these lines after reading Sandra&#39;s story about Marty&#39;s description--at<br/>\nthe dentist was it?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were on vacation this past week up in New Hampshire, and while there, we<br/>\nwent to an American Indian Educational Center (non-profit, but still owned,<br/>\ncollected and described by non-Native people) and a Shaker Village. Both<br/>\ntimes we had exchanges with the people there--both negative and relatively<br/>\npositive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the American Indian Center, there was a very rigid tour given by a very<br/>\nrigid tour guide who found herself very flustered by Emily&#39;s (7 yo) many<br/>\nquestions because it threw her off her very scripted talk. Towards the end,<br/>\nEm asked about some stories and costumes that she&#39;d seen the kids enjoying<br/>\nin the introductory video. The tour guide told her that was the story room<br/>\nonly used for school groups and that Em should come back sometime with her<br/>\nclass. Well, Emily said that she didn&#39;t &quot;do school&quot; and that she was on<br/>\nvacation. The tour guide launched into this whole, &quot;Well, someday you&#39;ll<br/>\nhave to do school&quot; yadda, yadda. Em responded that she would &quot;never have to<br/>\ndo school!&quot; to which the tour guide retorted, &quot;Well, then, you&#39;ll never get<br/>\nto try on those costumes then.&quot; Grrr! It was so mean-spirited, I was<br/>\nfloored. Later, I heard the tour guide remark to a co-worker that she was<br/>\ngoing to have to quit because she just didn&#39;t have the energy to keep doing<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day, we went to the Canterbury Shaker Village and had a really<br/>\ngreat experience. They just got a grant to begin some children&#39;s<br/>\nprogramming, so we went on a tour geared towards families that is,<br/>\napparently, a modified version of the tour they give school groups. We were<br/>\nthe only family in the early tour, and the young gal was so friendly and<br/>\nkind--she even mended Julia&#39;s purse strap after the tour because it broke<br/>\nwhile we were there. She encouraged all kinds of questions, listened<br/>\nattentively and kindly reminded them when they weren&#39;t allowed to touch<br/>\nsomething. The tour ended in the schoolhouse, where she started asking Emily<br/>\nhow she learned in school, to which Em replied that we &quot;unschool!&quot; The gal<br/>\nwas so positive about homeschooling, &quot;oh, it&#39;s so great you guys can do<br/>\nthat&quot; kind of stuff. Then she asks what Emily learns about at home, and<br/>\nEmily blurts out something along the lines of &quot;nothing! Absolutely nothing!<br/>\nI don&#39;t have to learn about anything!&quot; It was a very defensive kind of<br/>\nstance, left over, I think, from the day before. So, I said something along<br/>\nthe lines of, &quot;No, you don&#39;t *have* to learn about anything, but you *like*<br/>\nlearning about lots of stuff--why don&#39;t you tell her what kinds of things<br/>\nyou&#39;re interested in and what you like to do.&quot; She still didn&#39;t have much to<br/>\nsay, so I ended up listing off topics like mythology, egypt, butterflies,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, who&#39;s being defensive, I wonder? *g*  While in the first instance I was<br/>\nglad Em stood her ground and declared that she did *not* have to go to<br/>\nschool, the second day with someone open and positive, I found myself<br/>\ncringing at Em&#39;s description of us doing &quot;nothing.&quot; I ended up talking about<br/>\nhow we do an awful lot of stuff just like the tour we were on that day and<br/>\nthat the kids learn things in hands-on, self-directed ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m really interested in hearing how others feel about how unschooling<br/>\ngets described and whether we should &quot;arm&quot; our kids with responses and cues<br/>\nthat tell when people are looking for more traditional information about<br/>\nwhat we do.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Funniest explanations of unschooling by your kids","postDate":"1090875708","msgId":96926,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNlM3Jmcys0dmNwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":96933,"prevInTime":96925,"nextInTime":96927,"topicId":96926,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So my 17 yr old son and I visited a college this past weekend.
