Absolute numbers is the important aspect though, because without a <br/>\nglut of people, people are more valuable, according to the speaker, Kevin Bales, <br/>\nwho is considered a foremost expert on contemporary slavery. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe way they define slavery is someone who is:<br/>\nControlled by violence or the threat of violence,<br/>\nForced to work for no pay,<br/>\nhaving their labor used for the economic gain of another.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several ways people typically beome slaves:<br/>\nExtremely impoverished people, often living in shantytowns surrounding <br/>\ncities, are lured with the promise of work, brought far from their families, beaten <br/>\nand threatened with guns/death, and forced to work;<br/>\nWomen and children are often stolen and beaten and used in the sex trade or <br/>\nas domestics, or both;<br/>\nOr sometimes they are Debt Slaves, often held (again with violence) for <br/>\ngenerations-old debts by a relation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn most of the countries where this happens, there ARE laws against it, but <br/>\noften a corrupt government, especially police. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the US it is most usually trafficking in people, most often by people in <br/>\npower of the person&#39;s own race, and used as domestics, for child care, and <br/>\nsexually.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the numbers, they do not count even sweatshops where people make very <br/>\nlittle. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe said that there are some major differences in  slavery between now and the <br/>\n1800&#39;s. Then, in the US, a healthy 19 year old male agricultural slave cost <br/>\nthe equivelant of $38,500 in today&#39;s currency. Today the same slave would cost <br/>\n$90.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, ownership was stressed and slaves were maintained (because they were <br/>\nvaluable).
