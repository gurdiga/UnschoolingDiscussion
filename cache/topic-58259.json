While<br/>\nwaiting for 5yo sis to wake up, we made waffles with dd dumping the<br/>\ningredients in and mixing, and then she watched some cartoons while I<br/>\ncooked them. Getting impatient with sis (who was up till 1:00am trying to<br/>\nwin some kind of ticket on her Reader Rabbit computer game), she went in<br/>\nevery few minutes and would say &quot;wake up sunshine&quot;. No luck. Finally at<br/>\nabout 11:30, 5yod awoke and saw the snow. She quick rolled up a waffle,<br/>\nthey both put their snow clothes on and played in the snow. They built a<br/>\nsnowman, shoveled the sidewalk, and sled down our hill. They learned the<br/>\nFrosty the Snowman song. Then they shoveled out the chicken coop door and<br/>\nfed the chickens and collected eggs. When they got too cold, they came in<br/>\nand made hot cocoa and made sandwiches with the leftover waffles. 5yod<br/>\nplayed with Dad&#39;s remote control car. She decided she wanted to make a<br/>\nremote control caterpillar. She decorated an egg carton strip and taped<br/>\nbatteries to it. She was frustrated she couldn&#39;t make it move that way.<br/>\nDh showed and explained how the remote control worked and why the<br/>\ncaterpillar wouldn&#39;t move. DD decided to tie the caterpillar to the roof<br/>\nof the car and made it move that way. 3yod chased it around the house.<br/>\nSince they have been inside, they have also made a tent village in the<br/>\nliving room, put on a magic show, and are now playing Mommie and Baby<br/>\n(It&#39;s interesting to watch 5yod imitate me. I definitely need to work on<br/>\nchanging my tone of voice). I&#39;m trying to think of something quick to<br/>\nthrow together for dinner, and they will most likely want to help me with<br/>\nthat. That&#39;s about it so far!<br/>\nWende<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58258,"nextTopicId":58260}}
