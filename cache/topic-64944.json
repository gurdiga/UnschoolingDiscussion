I really don&#39;t have any idea <br/>\nwhat would be going at one of these.  When I think skinheads I think <br/>\nkind of media generalization protraying all skinheads as racists or <br/>\nwhite supremicists, but I could be wrong.  Is it something to do with <br/>\nwhite supremacy?  Or what?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I would have a hard time being too restrictive about most <br/>\nthings when I think back to all the stuff my generation did:  <br/>\nWoodstock, Philly Folk Festival, Mariposa Folk Festival, Duck Creek, <br/>\nand lots more.  But then we were &quot;flower children,&quot; not &quot;skinheads.&quot;  <br/>\nIs there a significant differance?  <br/>\n<br/>\nLots of things going on at all those concerts, to be sure.  Drugs, <br/>\nalcohol, sex.  Not that I ever indulged in any of those.....ahem.  <br/>\nBut they were going on.  I survived.  So did all seven of my younger <br/>\nsiblings who all indulged in varying degrees of 60s into 70s stuff.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t know what I would have done if my parents had found out and <br/>\nforbade me from going, either.  But I left for college at 16 and was <br/>\nbasically on my own when the age of flower children hit the world.  <br/>\nMom and Dad did not necessarily know what I was doing.  Well, except <br/>\nwhen I got arrested for some other 60s activities (war protests and <br/>\nanti-segregation protests, mostly).  But they left me to swim on my <br/>\nown through all that.
