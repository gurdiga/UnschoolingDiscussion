It&#39;s the ACTION <br/>\nof handwashing, the running water, that removes bacteria. Soap acts simply as <br/>\na &quot;lifter&quot; of dirt. One can have a very similar effect just from rinsing and <br/>\nrubbing.<br/>\nSo anti-bacterial soap is kinda like overkill (pardon the pun). The <br/>\nanti-bacterial properties don&#39;t make too much difference since it doesn&#39;t stay on your <br/>\nhands long enough to be effective. The only way that true anti-bacterial <br/>\neffects are seen is through high heat sterilization.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I will ever put my hands into an autoclave for 30 minutes.<br/>\nElissa Jill<br/>\nLife&#39;s challenges are not supposed to paralyze you;<br/>\nThey&#39;re supposed to help you discover who you are. <br/>\n~Bernice Johnson Reagon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98450,"nextTopicId":98694}}
