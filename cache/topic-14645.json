(or hear about) :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I recently had a parent of a five year old complain to me that since her<br/>\nson started kindergarten he wouldn&#39;t kiss her goodbye in the morning in<br/>\nfront of his friends in the school yard.  The sad part is that he probably<br/>\n*really * wanted to kiss her.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I remember being about 13 when my mom touching me out in public became<br/>\nkind of skeevy. I loved her and all, but I mean really, what if someone saw?<br/>\nAt home we were touchy and I sat on both my mom and dads laps well after I<br/>\nwas grown and gone. But public was different when I was younger. It got to<br/>\nbe fine once I moved away from home and grew up.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tara at 17 is extremely touchy with us, me especially.

That&#39;s how they filmed it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She&#39;s not different at all in public. She has no problem where ever we are<br/>\nof walking hand in hand with me or our arms around each other. She&#39;ll kiss<br/>\nus all no matter where we are too. In front of school or work or her<br/>\nfriends. It&#39;s nice. I love it and certainly hope the other 3 will be the<br/>\nsame way. And anytime she leaves me, even from conversation on the phone,<br/>\nshe always says she loves me.<br/>\n  Mary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I am a certified teacher from New ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-22948987\">Dear Julie inMO,<br/>\n  Don&#39;t worry about hitting all your subject areas or filling up your<br/>\ndays with your unschooling approach.  I am a certified teacher from New<br/>\nYork who taught 3rd, 4th and 5th grades in the public school, and I now<br/>\ndo tutoring on the side for public school students who are out of school<br/>\ntemporarily.  I follow an unschooling approach with my own children as<br/>\nwell, but I never worry about covering my bases because I know from<br/>\nexperience how little time is actually spent on academics in school. <br/>\nMost of the time  is spent on discipline, sorting, passing out paperwork,<br/>\nlining up to go back and forth to &#39;specials&#39;, and watching films.  As a<br/>\nhome teacher I work for three  districts. They all require 5 hours of<br/>\nwork a week for elementary students (1 hr. day) and 10 hrs. weekly (2hrs.<br/>\ndaily)  for high school kids.   By the time they return most of them are<br/>\neither caught up or ahead of their classes.   <br/>\n      Just trust yourself and what you are doing.   Remember that even if<br/>\nyou tried, you will probably never accomplish less than the daily<br/>\nschedule in a public school.  The most important thing that you are<br/>\ntrying to produce here is not a child who &#39;gets&#39; what he is supposed to<br/>\nknow, but rather an individual who actively seeks out answers to life&#39;s<br/>\nproblems as an adult.  The crown jewel is the end product, not<br/>\nnecessarily the route we take to get there. Best of luck!
