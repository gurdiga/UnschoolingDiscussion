I&#39;m sure he is bound for the stage, he loves to talk and he turns everything into a story which is told with expression and enthusiasm. He gets so caught up in stories, film and book that he often forgets that it isn&#39;t real. Even if it&#39;s a cartoon!! Is there anyone else out there with kids who do the same thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I start to panic I always remind myself of  the Einstein quote, &#39;Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just read the piece &#39;Serious Play&quot; by John Holt in Unschooling.com Online News and that was further comfort. Jess has so much more time to play, play, play. He is outside for most of the day sword fighting with his brother and making up all sorts of dramas. <br/>\n<br/>\nI often catch myself wondering how long it will be before he starts writing or  wanting to know about vikings and the history of early Australia. LOL. Then I slap myself around the head and  realize he is doing the important stuff right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70691,"nextTopicId":70737}}
