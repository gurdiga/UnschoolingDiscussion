He stays up late some nights and always takes care of things<br/>\nbefore going to bed, lets the dogs out one more time, brushes his teeth,<br/>\nturns off the lights, etc.  He&#39;s healthy.  He&#39;s never had a cavity.  He&#39;s<br/>\nnot over weight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToday we were shopping in another town.  We live in a rural area where<br/>\nthere&#39;s no real shopping and trips to another town come when we can<br/>\nafford the gas and have a good reason to go.  Dylan had $40.00 with him<br/>\nthat he&#39;s been saving.  We went to Wal-mart, K-mart, the mall... he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t spend any of his money.  He looked at dinosaurs and Lord of the<br/>\nRing toys, he looked at Harry Potter stuff and Legos and games for his<br/>\nGameboy and Playstation.  He didn&#39;t find anything he wanted to spend his<br/>\nmoney on.  We&#39;ve never told him how to shop, or what to buy.  Yes, he&#39;s<br/>\nmade some choices that he was unhappy with later but then so have I.

I just find it hard here to have people question what I haven&#39;t <br/>\nasked for when I&#39;m totally comfortable with it. Not meaning you in this <br/>\ncase. A good discussion about what works for others and what their <br/>\nexperiences are is one thing. Questioning what works for one family is <br/>\nsomething else. Again not you, I&#39;m being general here. Just finding that one <br/>\nsmall statement from me has gotten so big. And okay, I do like the last <br/>\nword!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If your kids are savvy consumers then why would you feel a need to tell <br/>\n&gt;them<br/>\n&gt;no about anything?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The no&#39;s directed at them was before when they were younger. I did know what <br/>\nthey liked and saw them spend money on things very disappointing. At that <br/>\ntime, they didn&#39;t learn and would go for the same kind of stuff the next <br/>\ntime. I would remind them about the lesson from before and in my way say no, <br/>\nwithout saying &quot;&quot;no you can&#39;t have it.&quot; At the same time, being prepared to <br/>\nactually say no if they insisted. I can probably think of one or two times <br/>\nwhen that happened between the two kids I&#39;m speaking of. I stood my ground <br/>\nbecause it was important to me and they forgot all about it when they found <br/>\nsomething else. To me, that no wasn&#39;t damaging.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But first you said that you know exactly what your kids will want and <br/>\n&gt;enjoy,<br/>\n&gt;but if that&#39;s true, why would they feel a need to ask for anything that <br/>\n&gt;isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;up to your standard?<br/>\n&gt;I think that&#39;s hypocritical to say you KNOW everything they will play with<br/>\n&gt;long term and enjoy but also say they have choice in what they buy.<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t think parent&#39;s know everything about their kids, we are good judges<br/>\n&gt;of them hopefully, but people change constantly. What a child would find<br/>\n&gt;wonderful at one point in their lives they will feel differently about <br/>\n&gt;later.<br/>\n&gt;I would hate to have my dh telling me that something I wanted wasn&#39;t good<br/>\n&gt;enough to spend money on. I don&#39;t think that means you shouldn&#39;t dialogue<br/>\n&gt;with them about the benefits/cost and so on. But if you&#39;re making the final<br/>\n&gt;say and telling us you know what is best for your kids at every turn and<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;re always right about the items the buy...well, that I don&#39;t believe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well I don&#39;t know where that came from!! Yes I said I know my kids and what <br/>\nthey like and yes I do know what will be played with and what won&#39;t. I&#39;m <br/>\ntalking about my 6 and 7 year olds. There is a point where that will all <br/>\nchange. So long term, I think not.  I just know how to help guide them in <br/>\ntheir choices. And no I don&#39;t make the final say on things now. When they <br/>\nwere younger, yes I did. Hasn&#39;t seemed to hurt them any.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as them asking for things that aren&#39;t up to my standards, you totally <br/>\nlost me on that one. I have no &quot;standards&quot; it&#39;s just I know junk when I see <br/>\nit! And now, those two children do too as well as the older one.
