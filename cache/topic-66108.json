Thanks soooo much for this posting!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt describes so well the &quot;deschooling process&quot; that we have been going <br/>\nthrough as well.  The stops and starts, by me and the kids, the structuring <br/>\nbinges and so on.  It sounds like this may be more the &quot;rule than the <br/>\nexception&quot; for most.  It would have helped me to see a quote like this in <br/>\none of the homeschooling books that I desperately read and scanned those <br/>\nfirst years, trying to &quot;normalize&quot; as much as possible (!!) our fledgling <br/>\nsteps.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, back to your question....Yes, I too have just begun noticing the <br/>\nsame effects as you.  My kids are not fighting as much...in fact they are <br/>\nand have been communicating more with each other (they are 14 and 10, boy <br/>\nand girl!!), helping each other and in fact, playing and learning <br/>\ntogether.  It is an amazing thing to see, especially considering that only <br/>\n3-4 years ago, before meds, one was trying to kill the other.  The <br/>\nemotional effects remain in the youngest (PTSD) but the relatively <br/>\nstress-free surroundings of home have helped heal some of those wounds, so <br/>\nthat they now can learn again and be with each other.  It is truly, for me, <br/>\na wondering, unschooling moment.  (Thanks to you all.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are also starting to do the &quot;interested in learning things stuff&quot;, <br/>\npicking things up on their own to do and pursuing it.  Really neat to see <br/>\nin action what I have been reading about for SO LONG!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only real problem is my daughter&#39;s lack of sufficient available <br/>\nfriends.  This is a child who is and has been only happy having someone to <br/>\nplay with 24 hours a day( I am not exaggerating).  This has been and still <br/>\nis her preferred activity of all.  Difficult in a neighborhood where every <br/>\nchild has homework everyday.  Even other homeschool friends at best, <br/>\nrequire playdates, driving long distances, and are busy doing other things <br/>\non a regular basis.  She is getting better about occupying herself.  But <br/>\nshe is not a loner, and it is a continual struggle dealing with her social <br/>\nlife, her self-perception as being so &quot;different&quot; from everyone else she <br/>\nknows.  I&#39;ve been arranging playdates for her since she was 2.  I hoped it <br/>\nwould end once she was of school age....WRONG!!!  Oh well...what&#39;s life <br/>\nwithout challenges!!!

Now, <br/>\nI must add that we had a lot of schoolishness on my part - read that <br/>\nfoolishness - in wanting her to do this and that, learn this and that, read, <br/>\nwrite, breathe this and that.  I would go for months at a time, lounging, <br/>\nloving and living and then suddenly my brain would backfire and urge me to <br/>\nperform schoolishly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also suffered from severe curriculosis.  I LOVED buying curriculum.  We <br/>\ntried them all.  Not many are worked through past week one.  Our true <br/>\ndeschooling happened when I spent nearly $1,000 on used OM stuff.  It <br/>\nsuddenly hit me that *I* hate being told what to do, how to do it, where to <br/>\ndo it, why to do it, when to do it, so I packed it up in a box and threw it <br/>\nin the garage.  I&#39;m certain we must have highly intelligent mice by now! ;)  <br/>\nThough at times I wonder if the answer isn&#39;t right there.

Finally, a place to be <br/>\nknown, understood, accepted.  A place my husband, should he choose to come, <br/>\ncan see for himself that children CAN be free of the Joneses and still turn <br/>\nout to be respectable individuals, able to learn and live on their own <br/>\nterms, in their own time and still be able to function outside the <br/>\nproverbial HOMSKOOL-white-trash-trailer.  THIS, my friends, is a HUGE <br/>\nmisconception here and we have a large homeschooling community.  As an <br/>\nunschooler, it gets even worse!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am making progress with him though, my husband that is.  We agreed to sell <br/>\nall the curriculum to pay for the trip!!  My deschooling process is not <br/>\nover.  I doubt it ever will be.  I have a lifetime of programs to debug.  <br/>\nPrograms my family, friends, neighbors and the media spit in my face daily.  <br/>\nI suppose I could hole myself away in the bush of Alaska and be free, but I <br/>\nhave to figure out how to find my husband a job there first!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
