We have six \nchildren,Cindy-16, Raymond-14,Michael-10, Julian-9, Gabriel-3, and Victoria-2. \nMy niece, Noryanna-10 lives with us also. Our family moved to Tennessee in \nOctober of 99 to get away from government control and overcrowding in \nMassachusetts. We now have ten beautiful acres. All of the children are \nhomeschooled except Raymond who insisted on going to a public school. He is \npresently regretting his decision. We have homeschooled&nbsp;for three years. I \nwas originally using mostly textbooks, but the more I read about unschooling the \nmore&nbsp;I think it is what our family needs. I have been looking&nbsp;for \nfamilies who have unschooed succesfully to ask some questions so if yours are \nmostly grown and gone, maybe you can help me. My biggest fear is government \nintervention for improper recordkeeping. I know my children are learning every \nday. Do you keep a daily log of activities? How does the school system in New \nZeland keep track of homeschoolers? This year I have given the children more \nfreedom in what they study and learn. I do require bookwork for math and \nlanguage arts. Otherwise what they learn is at their discretion. TV is kept to a \nminimum, unless it has something good to learn. My Michael loves the show Bill \nNye the Science Guy. Do you use portfolios? we will be going a lot of gardening \nand landscaping this year. Good hands on stuff. My husband is a truck driver and \ngone for two weeks at a time. Sometimes that is really hard. One advantage of \nhomeschooling is the kids can go with him sometimes. One on one time with Papi \nall to yourself for a week or two. How many children get that opportunity? \nsometimes it is absurd how ridiculous public schools can be. I have to go into \nmy Son Raymond&#39;s school tomorrow. He got in trouble for having a rubber band in \nhis hand. Rubber bands are forbidden in the gym room, they can be dangerous you \nknow. He wasn&#39;t trying to shoot it or anything, just had it in his hand sort of \nplaying with it&nbsp;while waiting for the bus. So now he has to write 100 times \n&quot; I will not have rubber bands in the&nbsp;gym room, ever.&quot; Can anyone believe \nthis?!&nbsp; I have a gigantic urge to wear my &quot;Question Authority&quot;&nbsp;pin \nfrom my youth when I go tomorrow. Is that sarcastic? I think some of the \nadministration are so caught up in the rules, they can&#39;t see the forest for the \ntrees.&nbsp;Have you had any dealings with public schools? How have they been? \nDo you farm or homestead? We have three dogs, two Great Pyrenees and a German \nShephard. I am considering getting a few sheep in the future.&nbsp;We also \nwant&nbsp;to get a few chickens. I can and bake home made bread.

And there would be easier and harder places to &quot;drill to <br/>\nthe center of the earth.  It depends what rock is down there, but under ALL <br/>\nof it there will eventually be some drill-breaking stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe finding statistics on the deepest holes ever dug would be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also possible to drill at an angle, or to turn a corner down in there.  <br/>\nSometimes mining thieves do that--kind of like rustling oil from the <br/>\nneighbor&#39;s mineral-rights claim.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s probably WAY more than any six-year-old will be interested in, but it <br/>\nmight be a fun ongoing curiosity for the adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, who lives in New Mexico where water is sometimes WAY down below the <br/>\nground, and wells for houses sometimes have to be over a thousand feet deep <br/>\nto get clean, drinkable water.  The elevation here is already 5,000 feet, <br/>\ngenerally, and  I haven&#39;t tried those, but I would if I were wanting to look. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jon and Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"LrVRIftMuF6Ezm5s5YNzTFgyZJzVJcxPrbi5iXKSuEj6BjkwTaICEtzxRKuFWopkiIVneFxb7PFnF47coag1fPMRcn3OtMSJrV-vamxQ3DfH","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Question for all the science minded","postDate":"983631367","msgId":16734,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTgwMWMwYTNmMiQxNDdiMWU0MCQwMTAwYThjMEBtc2hvbWUubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ5LjgyOTBkNzYuMjdkMjQzM2NAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":16733,"nextInTopic":16735,"prevInTime":16733,"nextInTime":16735,"topicId":16732,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Circumference of the earth = ~24,000mi (inferred from west to east coast distance of US =~3000mi transposed to the equator,~4000mi=4 out of 24 time zones=","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1619062315\">\n<html><head>\n \n\n\n</head> \n \n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1619062315270214314-03032001\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\">Circumference of the earth = ~24,000mi (inferred from west to east coast \ndistance of US =~3000mi transposed to the equator,~4000mi=4 out of 24 time \nzones= 1/6th of the circumference ~24,000mi.</font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1619062315270214314-03032001\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">Radius \nfrom circumference: C=2(pi(r)) C=2(3.14r) then r=C/2(pi) or C/6.28 \n=24,000/6.28<strong>=~3821mi. drill bit</strong></font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1619062315270214314-03032001\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\">Assumes the center of the earth is at the geometric center of the earth \n(sphere), drilling from &#39;sea-level&#39;. and wouldn&#39;t require a bit to drillthe \nwhole way really, (crust turns to magma a few hundred miles \ndown).</font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1619062315270214314-03032001\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1619062315270214314-03032001\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">really \none big rough estimate though, but can&#39;t be far off form the astrophysics \nmethod, considering.</font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1619062315270214314-03032001\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1619062315270214314-03032001\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">JON, \n(not Rue)</font></span></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote>\n  <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1619062315OutlookMessageHeader\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"left\"><font face=\"Tahoma\"\n size=\"2\">-----Original Message-----<br><b>From:</b> marbleface@... \n  [mailto:marbleface@...]<br><b>Sent:</b> Saturday, March 03, 2001 7:53 \n  AM<br><b>To:</b> Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com<br><b>Subject:</b> Re: \n  [Unschooling-dotcom] Question for all the science \n  minded<br><br></font></div><font face=\"arial,helvetica\"><font size=\"2\">In a \n  message dated 03/03/2001 2:47:06 AM !!!First Boot!!!, <br>hooperck@... \n  writes: <br><br><br>\n  <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\"\n TYPE=\"CITE\">Well, my 6 yr old would like to know how large a bit it would \n    take to <br>drill to the core of the earth. &nbsp;Who knows this??? \n    <br>Thanks, <br>Ann <br><br><br><br></blockquote></font><font face=\"Arial\"\n color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\"></font></font></blockquote><br><font\n face=\"Arial\" color=\"#000000\" size=\"2\"\n FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\"><br>http://www.worldbook.com/fun/ssystem/earth/html/quizint.htm \n  <br><br>google.com took me to a World Book quiz about earth stuff -- here&#39;s \n  the link. <br>&nbsp;Google had a lot of other links if that&#39;s not what you \n  want. <br><br>Nance <br><br></font><br><br><tt>Message \n  boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br>Check it all out at: \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br><br>Addresses:<br>Post \n  message: Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com<br>Unsubscribe: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br>List owner: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com<br>List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
