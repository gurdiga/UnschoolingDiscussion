I&#39;m new to this list, but I see having<br/>\nhonest discussions with him about how I authentically<br/>\nfeel about him to be part of unschooling (example:<br/>\n&quot;get your stinky feet out of my face!!! p.u.! boy,<br/>\nsmelling like that, you&#39;ll definitely be stuck at home<br/>\nwith me for your whole life, because only your mother<br/>\ncan love you like that!&quot;) obviously one does not make<br/>\ncomments like this when he is really down, but waits<br/>\ntill the right moment.<br/>\ndeppression can sometimes take a long time to heal,<br/>\nespecially after you finally dump the drugs, the<br/>\nschool, the dad, everything that wasn&#39;t working, and<br/>\nget cozy at home together. I saw it as a second<br/>\ninfancy with my son.<br/>\ndon&#39;t worry, there is light at the end of the tunnel.<br/>\nanna<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
