I also have 5 children, ages 11,<br/>\n8, 5, 3 and 2.  Here are the types of things we do:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  I talk with my kids about everything and I mean everything.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nmean lecture or teach them about things.  I just talk with them like I would<br/>\nmy husband about things that interest me or them.  The current political and<br/>\nstrategic situation our country is in is loaded with stuff.  I let the kids<br/>\nknow about stuff I read in the various papers.  So......they found<br/>\nAfghanistan on the globe (which generalized and now the kids play a game to<br/>\nsee who can find the most states in a short period of time), we talk<br/>\npolitics a lot (I&#39;m a pinko and dh is capitalist), we did goods drive for<br/>\nthe refugees and the kids understand I can talk to someone in Pakistan on<br/>\nthe computer and what their writing looks like, etc..  2 of my kids are<br/>\nfascinated with the weather forecasts, go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  The grocery store is great.  I send ds to find the cheapest bag of<br/>\nchips.  Send dd to find milk at no more than such and such a price.  We<br/>\nsmell and touch everything, weigh it, talk about where it comes from.  The<br/>\nkids wrote the grocery list today.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  We do 4-H projects.  Right now we are breeding rabbits and goats which<br/>\ntakes significant basic math skills for record keeping.  Also, doing a<br/>\nmartial arts project.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  We play games, go for walks, look up weird insects in reference books.<br/>\nThe kids do a lot of the cooking (complete dinner tonight).  Some days we<br/>\njust cuddle on the couch and watch tv.  We watch movies set in particular<br/>\ntime periods, television shows in different languages, listen to all kinds<br/>\nof music, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29496,"nextTopicId":29449}}
