With permission I am sending it to several<br/>\nlists (please forgive any duplication from this) in an effort to find<br/>\nKimberly some much needed support.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a support group exists (even online) that would be wonderful.  But if you<br/>\nare a mom with similar experience, I&#39;m sure it would help Kimberly a lot if<br/>\nyou contact her directly, too.  Her email address is  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kilogg@...\">kilogg@...</a>&gt;.  If<br/>\nyou could just send me a brief personal note to let me know that you are<br/>\ncorresponding with Kimberly I might rest a bit easier, too.  Thank you for<br/>\nany help and comfort you may provide.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------<br/>\nmy name is kimberly loggins-marshall (from torrance,ca). i<br/>\nspoke with you via telephone a few months back. i was pregnant with my now<br/>\ndeceased baby girl, &quot;audrey sinclare marshall&quot;. she was born healthy on feb<br/>\n6th 2000. then, she died unexpectedly in my arms and at my breast on march<br/>\n6th 2000. i have a surviving son name &quot;avery&quot;. he is three and a half years<br/>\nold. as you can imagine, it has been difficult to homeschool and grieve at<br/>\nthe same time. our family and friends have simply &quot;disappeared&quot;. i have<br/>\nmanaged to take avery to a few parks in our area so that he can play with<br/>\nother kids. when the kids parents find out that i have a deceased child/or<br/>\nwhen they see my apparent sadness - they to; disappear! a lot of kids at the<br/>\n<br/>\nparks (just as they do in preschools) have clicks. they leave other children<br/>\n<br/>\nOUT of their play activity. they do not allow other kids to play with. it is<br/>\n<br/>\nsad to see how small children are learning how to be mean and unaccepting at<br/>\n<br/>\na very young age. my son is very outgoing and friendly. not a shy bone in<br/>\nhis little body. he accepts everyone as long as they are not harmful toward<br/>\nhim. lately, he has not wanted to frequent the parks. today i asked him if<br/>\nhe wanted to go to the park; he replied, &quot;no, the kids are not going to play<br/>\n<br/>\nwith me anyway&quot;. he has since created this imaginary friend name jim/jack.<br/>\nthis friend is his age and very smart :) my heart aches not only for my<br/>\ndeceased daughter, but for my living son as well. do you know of any other<br/>\nbereaved parents who are also homeschooling their children? i belong to a<br/>\nfew support groups but no one is homeschooling their children. neither do<br/>\nthey have any kids averys age. i am eager to continue with the homeschooling<br/>\n<br/>\nprocess. it is important for me to see my son interact with other children<br/>\nwith the similar values and unbringing. and of course race does not matter<br/>\nwith us. i have noticed that it does for some cultures. ---snip--- if you<br/>\nhave any<br/>\nideas, please let me know or keep me posted. :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10695,"nextTopicId":10693}}
