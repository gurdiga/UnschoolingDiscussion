I can <br/>\nunderstand being proud of the country you live in, if you truly are.  I&#39;m <br/>\nproud of my adopted country, even with all its warts, but I really don&#39;t <br/>\nneed it to be *the best*.  It kind of reminds me of the old school spirit <br/>\nnonsense.  If they could get us to have lots of school spirit, maybe we <br/>\nwould forget about all the cr*p we had to deal with there.  Needless to <br/>\nsay, it didn&#39;t work with me, even the year I played in the marching band.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t help but see the connection between the huge fights that  sometimes <br/>\ntake place between students at neighbouring high schools, and the wars <br/>\nbetween nations that each think theirs is *the best* country.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I really hope you don&#39;t think your vote is going to make your country <br/>\nperfect.  Could be yours will be one of the ones that doesn&#39;t get counted <br/>\nwhen someone wants to buy an election.  Sorry to be so cynical, but I grew <br/>\nup there.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nTia Leschke   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island<br/>\n**************************************************************************<br/>\nIt is the answers which separate us, the questions which unite us. - Janice <br/>\nLevy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"cherry82171@aol.com","from":"cherry82171@...","profile":"cherry82171","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"3FVBv936CEDQ15-wQ-CGTT4_ro2FDAb2-EHnyH_C6i6HlU85DppVn90Y0EBklQBepZoUdQTXjcR7gw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:: patriotism and reality","postDate":"1004386614","msgId":27087,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZlLjEyMmIyYTQ1LjI5MGYxMzM2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":27098,"prevInTime":27086,"nextInTime":27088,"topicId":27087,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/28/01 6:05:59 AM Central Standard Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-126808076\">In a message dated 10/28/01 6:05:59 AM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; All things are not glorious in America but it&#39;s sure better than any other <br/>\nplace   on Earth.
