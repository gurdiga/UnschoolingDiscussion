His audience is<br/>\npeople involved in schooling. He&#39;s trying to convince teachers and those<br/>\nconcerned about changing schools -- *not* parents considering homeschooling<br/>\n-- that schooling methods based on drill and kill and testing are flawed and<br/>\nharmful.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And I wouldn&#39;t characterize Frank Smith&#39;s presentation in his Book of<br/>\nLearning and Forgetting (I didn&#39;t even know the other existed) as maligning<br/>\nteaching but as cogent argument against rote learning. He respects the fact<br/>\nthat his audience is concerned and cares about children and teaching and<br/>\nschools.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s your purpose in maligning schools *here* to *this* audience of<br/>\nunschoolers and those wanting to move towards unschooling? How is your<br/>\npurpose compatible with the list&#39;s description at Yahoo?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople do share their *personal* experiences with school. It&#39;s part of the<br/>\nprocess of letting go. They&#39;ll get sympathy and support and the sharing of<br/>\nsimilar personal experiences. It&#39;s the first step for some. (Some skip right<br/>\nover it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the purposes of this list -- maybe the primary purpose -- is to help<br/>\npeople find the answer to &quot;So, where do I go from here?&quot; What is your<br/>\npurpose in repeatedly directing the spotlight back to that first step and<br/>\nback behind where people came from? How is it helping people move forward?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour reponses, lack of responses to many direct questions, and behavior seem<br/>\nto indicate that you don&#39;t understand the purpose of this list. Considering<br/>\nyour writing on unschooling I find that incredibly difficult to believe so<br/>\nthe next logical conclusion is that you don&#39;t *respect* the purpose of this<br/>\nlist. That you think it should serve some other purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy? Explain it to me. Explain *something* to me. *Don&#39;t* tell me why you<br/>\nthink schools need maligned. I get it. (About a 100 posts ago. I am equally<br/>\nnot dumb.) Tell me why you think *this* audience needs to focus so heavily<br/>\non schools.

I take that as an endorsement of<br/>\nunschooling -- the absence of schooling. Smith&#39;s other objection seems to be<br/>\nthat homeschooled kids sometimes don&#39;t have enough friends, so I repeat my<br/>\nsuggestion that parents have an obligation to help their children find<br/>\nfriends, if only to complain to.  :^)<br/>\n<br/>\nOver two thousand years ago, Socrates told us that if someone started<br/>\ncharging money for teaching the youth things that are well known to<br/>\nvirtually every adult in the society, it would be fraud.
