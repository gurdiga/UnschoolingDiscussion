Made me feel better about <br/>\nall of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob, Alittle info I can share.  I feel as though not only have I been <br/>\nstruck re:unschooling, but about 2 yrs ago I went thru a <br/>\ntransformation.  Grew up in a fundamentalist family who lived at <br/>\nchurch.  My father is a big hypocrite in the faith.  Started my <br/>\nfamily knowing the kids needed to church as I have always done.<br/>\nQuickly realized thru various episodes that church isn&#39;t always the <br/>\nanswer.  We quit our church about 2 yrs ago and lost quite a few <br/>\nfriends/contacts.  I can honestly say that all of my family are born <br/>\nagain followers of Christ.  But we won&#39;t look like the typical <br/>\nfundamentalist family.  We no longer go to church, we don&#39;t have <br/>\nregular bible devotions, and we no longer school at home.  Of course <br/>\nour families think we have lots of to answer for but I have seen the <br/>\nlight.<br/>\nMy kids are happier now.  There biggest complaints about church was <br/>\nthe rules and the constant skimming of the bible stories.  After all <br/>\nhow many times can you talk about Noah and never get past the story.  <br/>\nMy kids want to know how bad that ark smelled and who cleaned up the <br/>\npoop.  Not there was once a man.....<br/>\nI&#39;m sure I will lose a few more friends when they find out I no <br/>\nlonger school at home.<br/>\nBut I know that I love Jesus and that my kids do too.
