Their cruising <br/>\ngoes straight to someone&#39;s house to play games.  And when he was four he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t WANT to go anywhere or stay out all night, so that was easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe what I&#39;m saying is that I WOULD let a four year old.  I just never had <br/>\na four year old who didn&#39;t want to hang out with me!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if I gave them no choice they couldn&#39;t possibly be staying home with me <br/>\nby choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they were little and we went to playdays at the park, before we were <br/>\nhomeschoolers, it was a La Leche League babysitting co-op park day, so the <br/>\nfamilies were all into attachment parenting.  That helped.   And attachment <br/>\nparenting says if you let the kids be with you all they want to, they will <br/>\neventually want to walk away and explore the world on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe really cool thing is if you let a baby sit with you and climb on you and <br/>\nnurse on you and sleep on your lap, if he gets up and toddles away toward the <br/>\nplayground, you know he truly WANTS to go to the playground.  And so his <br/>\nexperience is different from a kid whose mom said, &quot;We came to the <br/>\nplayground, now GO PLAY.  And make it snappy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if a child WANTS to go to the playground, he might or might not need a <br/>\nmom following right behind him.  Depends on the place and the child.  And if <br/>\nhe says &quot;Come with me,&quot; and you say &quot;OKAY!&quot; (instead of &quot;No, I&#39;m talking to <br/>\nmy friends, you go play by yourself&quot;) then he starts getting some life long <br/>\nconfidence that if he needs his mom to come, she will.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning at 10:00 there was a phone call for Kirby.  &quot;Kirby&#39;s asleep.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I know, I&#39;m sorry.  This is Ryan.  I really need to talk to him.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Okay.&quot;  And I start hobbling up the stairs to Kirby&#39;s room.  I trust Ryan.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s older, 20 maybe, and works with Kirby at the gaming shop.  He and his <br/>\ngirlfriend hang out with Kirby socially at least twice a week.  On the way I <br/>\nreminded him I&#39;m slow because of the leg, and he said, &quot;Glen&#39;s dad had a <br/>\nstroke, so they had to go to Alamogordo.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlamogordo is a four hour drive to the southeast.   Glen is the owner&#39;s <br/>\nhusband and &quot;they&quot; are Glen and his wife Jodi, who owns the shop.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby wasn&#39;t in his bed.  His friend Joey was on a futon on the floor, so I <br/>\nhad to wake Joey up.  Before I went to sleep, I passed on the two Kirby phone <br/>\nmessages:  Kevin called and Will called.  So I said, &quot;Joey, did Kirby go home <br/>\nwith Will?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI told Ryan I&#39;d call Kirby.  So I end up waking up Will (who trusts me) who <br/>\nwoke up Kirby, and another friend also staying over there took Kirby to work <br/>\nat 11:30.  He&#39;ll work until 3:30 when he goes to karate for two hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told Kirby that if none of those guys at Will&#39;s could give him a ride, I <br/>\nwould go and get him if he could call and wait outside.  I can drive short <br/>\ndistances now, and it&#39;s not that far.  He called when he knew he had another <br/>\nride.

We are vegetarians but they <br/>\nare always allowed to eat what they want when we go out.  They also decide <br/>\nwhen they want to eat and how much.  My boys decide what they want to wear <br/>\nand do not want to wear (another humorous story) and have always done so.  <br/>\nThey decide about TV and PS2.  Also make their own decisions about computer <br/>\ngames.  I do make them brush their teeth.  Actually I have always brushed <br/>\ntheir teeth (they are 8 and 5 now).  The dentist is a phobia of mine.  I make <br/>\nhealth related decisions at this point and safety related decisions like <br/>\nriding their bike in the road.  That will probably change as they age.  <br/>\nAlthough we do discuss everything.  I do tell them why I feel it is necessary <br/>\nthat they see the dentist.  And they do love the dentist she is great.  They <br/>\nare allowed to express their opinions on the subject and are also allowed to <br/>\ntheir feelings.  We do a lot of talking.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey pick up their rooms when they feel they need to, like when a friend is <br/>\ncoming over and they want to play in their room.  I pick up their toys when <br/>\nthey get in my way.  They do leave a lot of projects and toys in progress <br/>\nlike LEGOs around the house and that is not a problem.  They pick those up <br/>\nwhen they need a place to play.  I am not a neat freak by any means.  We each <br/>\nhave our own computers.  I keep mine neat.  They do not.  But it doesn&#39;t seem <br/>\nto bother them and it doesn&#39;t bother me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway just a few of the things we do.
