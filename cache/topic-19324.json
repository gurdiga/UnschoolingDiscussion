When I was single and decided to \n<br>homeschool my daughter I made a list of all the things I could do to earn \n<br>money and that I could have her with me (she was very young at the time). All \n<br>of them entailed being my own boss and going out and finding people to use my \n<br>services. I was committed to doing whatever it took to have her with me and \n<br>be able to homeschool. What came out of that list and the subsequent things I \n<br>did was I opened my own landscape company. I didnt have any money to start it \n<br>but I just did it. I think it takes some thinking &quot;outside the box&quot;, but I \n<br>know that anyone. . . absolutely anyone can do it if they put their mind to \n<br>it.\n<br>\n<br>lovemary</font></font></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19320,"nextTopicId":19316}}
