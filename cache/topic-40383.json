Since3 this is a list that describes itself as an unschooling<br/>\nlist, can we please discuss it?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a new thread,<br/>\nA local mom and I were discussing how as we have gotten deeper into<br/>\nunschooling, HOMEschooling issues have begun to mean less to us. For<br/>\nexample, certain words are gone from our vocabulary - field trips,<br/>\nhomeschooling groups, and of course the typical ones, curriculum, language<br/>\narts, etc. We both have noticed that we feel disconnected to the<br/>\n&quot;Homeschooling Community&quot; since *education* is not something we really think<br/>\nabout, we are now able to see that learning doesn&#39;t need quite so much<br/>\ndiscussion and debate. The disconnection doesn&#39;t really bother us. In fact,<br/>\nfor me, it is a good thoing because I tend to get caught up with all the<br/>\npretty flashy ads for math books or reading programs even knowing it&#39;s not<br/>\ngood for the kids. (Just like Pop-tarts come in brightly colored boxes<br/>\ndesigned to attract)<br/>\nSo, that&#39;s just an observation I&#39;ve had.<br/>\nQuestion:<br/>\nDD is 8 1/2 and just starting to read. She is interested in easy books but<br/>\nour problem is the subject matter of said books. They are all about little<br/>\nkid topics, starting kindegarten, babyish pictures, etc. Does anyone have<br/>\nideas on easy readers that are a little more interesting for tweens? (That<br/>\nwould inolve babysitting, horses or Mary Kate and Ashley?
