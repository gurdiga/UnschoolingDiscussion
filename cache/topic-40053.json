It is a group of sciences<br/>\nthat include arithmetic, geometry, algebra and calculus [and others for<br/>\nhigher math]. Derivation &gt;Greek for &quot;something learned.&quot; <br/>\nIn England and many former British colonies, the term used is maths with<br/>\nan &#39;s&#39; rather than math  because it is recognized that it is made up of<br/>\nseveral branches.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you know what arithmetic is as opposed to mathematics?<br/>\nArithmetic actually means the skills of using numbers to count, add,<br/>\nsubtract, multiply and divide, and these operations are done with whole<br/>\nnumbers, fractions, decimals and percents.  It is pretty interesting<br/>\nthat the first thing you do when finding out about fractions is to COUNT<br/>\nwith them. In the old 1800&#39;s school books, they actually did exercises<br/>\nto count aloud 1/4, 2/4 (or 1/2), 3/4, 4/4 (or 1), 5/4 (or 1 1/4), etc<br/>\nto get the feel for the whole continuum of number and where fractions<br/>\nfit in. OF course you can do that with portions of a chocolate bar or<br/>\nother concrete things. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy own formulated purpose for mathematics: Tools and a language to think<br/>\nabout and communicate with precision in solving problems of interest in<br/>\nlife. Math is used to put order into the universe to be able to handle<br/>\nit more easily and efficiently.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually an underlying thought of that came from someone else: &quot;<br/>\nMathematics is just a nice big beautiful term for precise thinking ...&quot;.<br/>\nL. Ron Hubbard  Also by Hubbard: &quot;... [the mind] perceives, poses, and<br/>\nresolves problems relating to the survival of the organism, the future<br/>\ngenerations, the group, life and the physical universe and puts the<br/>\nsolutions into action.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWay useful stuff, mathematics. If you are dealing with the physical<br/>\nuniverse. I always try to expand my own use of math in life -- look<br/>\nwhere it has taken us: computers, space flights, buildings, etc - you<br/>\ncan get a complex product when you can do math! <br/>\n<br/>\nAT a level in between measuring stuff in cooking and operating space<br/>\nflights is this fun question: &quot;How many Ping-Pong balls do you think<br/>\nwould fit inside this room?&quot; Quite a question for speculation....  THis<br/>\nis from a book called &quot;Family Learning&quot; by William Russell, who then<br/>\ngoes on to describe guessing what it would be, and trying to figure out<br/>\nwhat a real ball park estimate would be, and finally devising a way to<br/>\nfigure it out by seeing how many Ping-Pong balls would fit along the<br/>\nbottom of one wall (which could be done by measuring across the ball and<br/>\nthen measuring the distance of the wall and seeing how many would fit<br/>\nthere), then seeing how many Ping-Pong balls would fit along the side<br/>\nwall to that one, and then finally how many would fit  up the wall in<br/>\nthe corner between the floor and calling. Hmm... that is three<br/>\nmeasurements, the measure of three dimensions.... giving you voila! the<br/>\nvolume of space in the room calculated in Ping-Pong balls. I really<br/>\nlaughed when I read that one and immediately wanted to go off and try<br/>\nit. Family learning is a delightful book covering all kinds of ideas,<br/>\nnot just math. i like it! Hmm..
