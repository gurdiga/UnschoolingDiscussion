As I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think that there are lots and lots of people here who have had your doubts and still have your doubts.   They, the doubts, come and go, yet,  the more I read and learn the less they come around!   Which is great.    <br/>\n <br/>\nSeriously,   read all you can on unschooling.com,   it especially helped me on the TV/video game restrictions thing.    As Sandra said,  read Mary Gold&#39;s article.    I was extremely against watching TV or playing video games.    Then I started learning about unschooling,   we can not even begin to understand what our children are learning while they are doing those things.      I know I learned a ton watching different situations on TV as I was growing up.   <br/>\nI think you&#39;ll be surprised at how your children will actually shut off the TV,  or video game (if they have one)   give them the choice and its amazing.    Of course if there is a new show they like or a new game they want to play,  they might play/watch for hours.  I know I spend alot of time on new things when I get them, a new book, a new video.  And isn&#39;t their stick-to-itiveness (sp?&lt;g&gt;) showing then?  And so many worry about kids being quitters and all.    Its all perspective.   And if you look from theirs,   its a whole new ball game!<br/>\n<br/>\n It is hard to let it go,  our judgement of what is worth doing.  But the sooner we can do it, the sooner our children can begin this wonderful life of unschooling.    And then all of a sudden you&#39;ll just stop and see it all happening.   I think this links right to unschooling as living life.   Stop thinking about what is &#39;educational&#39;;  just play,  have fun,  and the one idea that really got me was--try to go a day and not learn something.  That concept is amazing,  learning is continual, always happening.      Live and be joyful within the day, the moment,  and don&#39;t think about what they are going to be doing  10 years down the line.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSorry for going on and on,  but I get so excited when I start writing or talking about it!!<br/>\n <br/>\nGet ready for a wonderful, eye opening journey,  its just beginning!<br/>\n <br/>\nTake care,<br/>\n <br/>\nKelli<br/>\n <br/>\nOh,  and I was going to ask,  are you connected to Writing Strands,  thought I saw our name there?<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n &quot;Julie Bogart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:julie@...\">julie@...</a>&gt;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:julie@...\">julie@...</a>&gt; wrote:--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, Fetteroll <br/>\n&lt;fetteroll@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Joyce for your comments.

But it&#39;s <br/>\ntaken getting over my aversion from school to even face those <br/>\nauthors and titles.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that, I have no problem waiting or allowing my kids to make <br/>\nthose decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s helpful to divorce the need to suggest from the judgement <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of how<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; they&#39;re using their time.

I was <br/>\nstarting to think I was a wimp all by myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, I&#39;ve had no trouble following this mindset with young <br/>\nkids. They&#39;ve been robust, enthusiasitic, self-motivated <br/>\nlearners--all five. It&#39;s this teen stuff this is throwing me for such a <br/>\nloop!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere for a while my daughter (11yo)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; was getting up to watch TV all day.

(That&#39;s a rhetorical question but you can <br/>\n </span></blockquote>tell us if<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it would help you figure it out. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, thanks for asking. I will share who the two oldest are so I <br/>\ncan at least get them out on the table here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest is male, 15. Noah is incredibly gifted with anything that <br/>\nrequires his hands. He has done string games, origami, <br/>\npuzzles, computer games, clay sculpting, piano, guitar, wiki <br/>\nsticks, rock climbing and drawing. His interest in piano is a true <br/>\ndepiction of his personality.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe heard the song Rondo Ala Turka (Mozart) on the Pride and <br/>\nPrejudice videos four years ago. Suddenly he wanted to learn to <br/>\nplay the piano. I told him he could take lessons. He brought the <br/>\nsheet music to his first lesson and never did use the intro to <br/>\npiano music. He started with Mozart. and immediately learned to <br/>\nplay. Played non-stop all the time, no reminders to practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn three years time, he became her most gifted student. <br/>\nHowever, conversely, he stopped practicing and kept forgetting <br/>\nhis lessons during the last six months. I finally stopped the <br/>\nlessons (not wanting to pay for what he wasn&#39;t doing). Broke my <br/>\nheart. His talent and passion all gone by the way side. No more <br/>\nplaying for the joy of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen suddenly, since Christmas, he took up playing again, but <br/>\non his own. This time he is playing Vanessa Carlton round the <br/>\nclock. And he&#39;s playing extremely well. I asked him what was <br/>\ngoing on. His words: I like this music. I got tired of my teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is Noah all over. He is completely self taught in electric <br/>\nguitar. And is doing that well too. He loves heavy metal and <br/>\nwants to be in a rock band. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe reads widely and well. He acts in plays, loves Shakespeare, <br/>\nhas written a screenplay, he&#39;s on the teen board for the library... <br/>\nHe&#39;s been a model of what I thought unschooling would yield.<br/>\n<br/>\nSocially it&#39;s been another story. He is extremely intimidated by <br/>\nhis peer group. He has friends, and he&#39;s very chatty when with a <br/>\ngroup of kids his age, but he hates phone calling and complains <br/>\nabout not having a buddy... yet does nothing to cultivate <br/>\nrelationships. This has been our biggest concern for him. he <br/>\ngets sort of paralyzed about pursuing friendships.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd like a typicl kid whose been doing what he wants for most of <br/>\nhis life, he has little patience to follow through on anything that <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t feel like pursuing. Sometimes that looks like laziness <br/>\nto me. I remember being pushed to finish things and being glad <br/>\nfor that push... so where to draw the line? Is there a line?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 13 dd is another story. She wants to go to school because it <br/>\nis a universal experience that most people have had and she&#39;s <br/>\nnever had it. She wants a locker, friends to chat with in the halls, <br/>\nboys to flirt with and dances to go to. She wants the football <br/>\ngames and the homework and teachers.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe really wants the school experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is also wanting to make friends outside of the homeschool <br/>\nworld (which feels extremely narrow to her).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is active online with an international community of Elijah <br/>\nWood fans. She&#39;s got friends all over the world sending her <br/>\nletters and gifts and invitations to visit. :) She reads voraciously. <br/>\nAnd she&#39;s written two novellas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a highly gifted girl in relational skills (opposite her <br/>\nbrother). She used to have stronger interests (i.e. vintage dance, <br/>\nart, costume deisgn). She is more interested now in acting and <br/>\nsinging.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut mostly what I worry about is that I feel a pulling away from <br/>\nfamily in all this social pursuit. I&#39;d be for it all (I am highly <br/>\nextroverted too) if it didn&#39;t seem to mean that she was less happy <br/>\nbeing with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nArgh.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is too long already. Even as I type, I think, &quot;These are cool <br/>\nkids. What am I worried about?&quot; Sigh. I guess that&#39;s why I write it <br/>\nout. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo schoo may be on the horizon. We may do part ttime <br/>\nenrollment to see if that is enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the input today. My head is swimming. But this is <br/>\njust what I needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo! Groups SponsorADVERTISEMENT<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

But it&#39;s <br/>\ntaken getting over my aversion from school to even face those <br/>\nauthors and titles.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that, I have no problem waiting or allowing my kids to make <br/>\nthose decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s helpful to divorce the need to suggest from the judgement <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of how<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; they&#39;re using their time.

I was <br/>\nstarting to think I was a wimp all by myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, I&#39;ve had no trouble following this mindset with young <br/>\nkids. They&#39;ve been robust, enthusiasitic, self-motivated <br/>\nlearners--all five. It&#39;s this teen stuff this is throwing me for such a <br/>\nloop!<br/>\n<br/>\n There for a while my daughter (11yo)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; was getting up to watch TV all day. It must have lasted for 2 or 3 <br/>\n </span></blockquote>months.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (Or it felt that way!) <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Confession: I would utterly freak out if this were the case.

That&#39;s one <br/>\nboundary I don&#39;t think I could give up yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, who are you kids? (That&#39;s a rhetorical question but you can <br/>\n </span></blockquote>tell us if<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it would help you figure it out. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, thanks for asking. I will share who the two oldest are so I <br/>\ncan at least get them out on the table here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest is male, 15. Noah is incredibly gifted with anything that <br/>\nrequires his hands. He has done string games, origami, <br/>\npuzzles, computer games, clay sculpting, piano, guitar, wiki <br/>\nsticks, rock climbing and drawing. His interest in piano is a true <br/>\ndepiction of his personality.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe heard the song Rondo Ala Turka (Mozart) on the Pride and <br/>\nPrejudice videos four years ago. Suddenly he wanted to learn to <br/>\nplay the piano. I told him he could take lessons. He brought the <br/>\nsheet music to his first lesson and never did use the intro to <br/>\npiano music. He started with Mozart. and immediately learned to <br/>\nplay. Played non-stop all the time, no reminders to practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn three years time, he became her most gifted student. <br/>\nHowever, conversely, he stopped practicing and kept forgetting <br/>\nhis lessons during the last six months. I finally stopped the <br/>\nlessons (not wanting to pay for what he wasn&#39;t doing). Broke my <br/>\nheart. His talent and passion all gone by the way side. No more <br/>\nplaying for the joy of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen suddenly, since Christmas, he took up playing again, but <br/>\non his own. This time he is playing Vanessa Carlton round the <br/>\nclock. And he&#39;s playing extremely well. I asked him what was <br/>\ngoing on. His words: I like this music. I got tired of my teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is Noah all over. He is completely self taught in electric <br/>\nguitar. And is doing that well too. He loves heavy metal and <br/>\nwants to be in a rock band. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe reads widely and well. He acts in plays, loves Shakespeare, <br/>\nhas written a screenplay, he&#39;s on the teen board for the library... <br/>\nHe&#39;s been a model of what I thought unschooling would yield.<br/>\n<br/>\nSocially it&#39;s been another story. He is extremely intimidated by <br/>\nhis peer group. He has friends, and he&#39;s very chatty when with a <br/>\ngroup of kids his age, but he hates phone calling and complains <br/>\nabout not having a buddy... yet does nothing to cultivate <br/>\nrelationships. This has been our biggest concern for him. he <br/>\ngets sort of paralyzed about pursuing friendships.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd like a typicl kid whose been doing what he wants for most of <br/>\nhis life, he has little patience to follow through on anything that <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t feel like pursuing. Sometimes that looks like laziness <br/>\nto me. I remember being pushed to finish things and being glad <br/>\nfor that push... so where to draw the line? Is there a line?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 13 dd is another story. She wants to go to school because it <br/>\nis a universal experience that most people have had and she&#39;s <br/>\nnever had it. She wants a locker, friends to chat with in the halls, <br/>\nboys to flirt with and dances to go to. She wants the football <br/>\ngames and the homework and teachers.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe really wants the school experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is also wanting to make friends outside of the homeschool <br/>\nworld (which feels extremely narrow to her).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is active online with an international community of Elijah <br/>\nWood fans. She&#39;s got friends all over the world sending her <br/>\nletters and gifts and invitations to visit. :) She reads voraciously. <br/>\nAnd she&#39;s written two novellas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a highly gifted girl in relational skills (opposite her <br/>\nbrother). She used to have stronger interests (i.e. vintage dance, <br/>\nart, costume deisgn). She is more interested now in acting and <br/>\nsinging.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut mostly what I worry about is that I feel a pulling away from <br/>\nfamily in all this social pursuit. I&#39;d be for it all (I am highly <br/>\nextroverted too) if it didn&#39;t seem to mean that she was less happy <br/>\nbeing with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nArgh.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is too long already. Even as I type, I think, &quot;These are cool <br/>\nkids. What am I worried about?&quot; Sigh. I guess that&#39;s why I write it <br/>\nout. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo schoo may be on the horizon. We may do part ttime <br/>\nenrollment to see if that is enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the input today. My head is swimming.

And people can sympathize and tell you<br/>\ntheir kids did exactly that and how it came out for them. They can perhaps<br/>\nhelp you see the situation in a way that you hadn&#39;t. Perhaps people can help<br/>\nyou see that you aren&#39;t involved enough, or not offering them better things<br/>\nto do, or that looking for what they aren&#39;t learning is blinding you to what<br/>\nthey are learning. It&#39;s going to depend on the situation, but usually a<br/>\nvariety of good stuff comes out of someone asking for support/help with<br/>\nsomething that&#39;s bothering them.

We&#39;re all part of a family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m talking about connections and staying connected and being<br/>\nresponsive to their needs. And getting in there and mixing things up,<br/>\nperhaps, if things are feeling to routine.

I want to allow them to learn the <br/>\nway I learn but sometimes lose my confidence. I know that I go in <br/>\nhot streaks and then take breaks. I tend to focus on one area at a <br/>\ntime, not break my interests into seven neat chunks that get daily <br/>\nattention. So I have wanted to do that with my children too.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I suppose that what is tough is that kids really do appear to <br/>\nbe wasting time to us. And I do lose my confidence when the <br/>\nchief interest of a child is to chat all day on the computer with <br/>\nfriends or play James Bond on the X box all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs direction a part of unschooling at all? Any suggestions of how <br/>\nto spend time taboo?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo most of you simply rise in the morning and your kids live their <br/>\nparallel lives around you? When my kids were younger, so much <br/>\nof what we did we did together and there was a natural <br/>\nconfluence between what they were interested in and how I <br/>\ncould faciliate that. As they&#39;ve gotten older, that has changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our home, we&#39;ve always had a read a loud time (for literature <br/>\nor historical fiction) and do some regularly scheduled activities <br/>\nthat do appear schoolish. (From another unschooling list I was <br/>\non, this was considered table time for the basics). We&#39;ve done <br/>\nmath consistently and language arts based on the Charlotte <br/>\nMason approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they do have lots of time to pursue their interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose I find myself juding their interests. I look ahead and <br/>\nthink that they ought to be making the most of these teen years <br/>\nfor more than social life or X Box!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, there&#39;s my bias. But does no one else feel it? I&#39;ve been <br/>\nreading this list for two weeks and I guess I&#39;m wondering if no <br/>\none goes through dissatisfactions or worries about how their <br/>\nkids spend their time. Would anyone be willing to discuss this? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; There really aren&#39;t any guarantees with unschooling.

That sounds like a <br/>\nframework. Iow, I would say that a goal would be to help our kids <br/>\nfind a meaningful place in the adult world as responsbile, <br/>\ncompetent adults. But I don&#39;t know if &quot;trusting that they will learn <br/>\nwhat they need&quot; is a goal in the same way. It is a philosophy for <br/>\nachieving a goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I suppose at this point, I really do want that philosophy to <br/>\ncontinue in my family. It has worked so far. But now I am feeling <br/>\nthat anxiety that comes with things not looking how I expected... I <br/>\nwonder if that is sufficient for that preparation for adulthood.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I am dealing with their new desires--to go to school, for <br/>\ninstance. Does that fall under the category of &quot;trusting they will <br/>\nlearn what they need&quot;? What if the child is now saying &quot;I think I <br/>\nneed school&quot;? Do I honor that?<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay. Stopping now.

That&#39;s often a good test. Another good test<br/>\nmight be to ask if you&#39;re treating their use of it the same as you would<br/>\ntheir &quot;use&quot; of a comic book. How much of yourself do you have invested in<br/>\nthem using the mainstream educational methods, and using them in the &quot;right&quot;<br/>\nway?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother good test is to see if you would be feeling the same way or doing<br/>\nthe same things if it were your husband you were relating to. Would it be<br/>\nokay if he used a textbook?

But it will look different for<br/>\neach family. Which makes it hard to describe! Obviously people want real<br/>\nexamples not just philosophy.

Do you mean he doesn&#39;t get out of bed<br/>\nin the morning? Do you mean he watches TV all day? Do you mean he isn&#39;t<br/>\ndoing anything that resembles learning in school?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike the standard approaches to learning (and parenting) the what is not<br/>\nnearly as important as the why.

However, I have never posted an<br/>\nintro, mostly because I wasn&#39;t sure if I was going to stay. In a lot of<br/>\nways, this list has been much like a car wreck. You drive by, and even<br/>\nthough you know it will upset you, you look in anyway. You just can&#39;t<br/>\nhelp yourself. You know you will see pain and bickering, and sometimes<br/>\n(almost always) a lack of common sense that caused the wreck to begin<br/>\nwith. On the other hand, you see the good Samaritan helping victims, <br/>\ntotal strangers trying to make the whole ordeal as painless as possible,<br/>\ngiving advice, soothing wounds, just being there. Well, I will continue<br/>\nto look in at this list, trying to ignore the bickering, etc. and soak in<br/>\nthe advice, and the good Samaritans&#39; offers of help. Now for the intro:<br/>\n        I&#39;m a 34yo stay at home mom with two girls 3 & 5, and married to<br/>\na wonderful husband for 13 years. We had both decided before we had<br/>\nchildren that we would school-at-home, and after reading as many books as<br/>\nI could find on the subject, came across this thing called &quot;unschooling&quot;.<br/>\nMary Griffith and John Holt made the whole idea very attractive, and it<br/>\nlooked complimentary to our sporadic lifestyle. Now for the confession:<br/>\n        I don&#39;t *get it*. After reading these various books I thought  I<br/>\n*got it*. But reading this list has me convinced that I don&#39;t. I<br/>\nunderstood &quot;unschooling&quot; to be child-led, not child-controlled. I thought<br/>\nthat unschooling was a way to do away with the mainstream&#39;s way of<br/>\npigeonholing children into a particular set of standards and learning<br/>\nmethods, only to find out that there are the militant unschoolers that<br/>\nsay there is only one way of unschooling.  I thought unschooling involved<br/>\ngiving your children all the resources they need to accomplish what they<br/>\nwant, whether it be textbooks, videos, pots and pans, whatever. I guess<br/>\nmy question is, can bits and pieces of mainstream educational methods be<br/>\nused, if at the leading of the child or the suggestion of the parent, and<br/>\nthis still come under the definition of unschooling? Does &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>\nhave a standard definition, or is it conditional on what works for any<br/>\ngiven family? The intro letter says how it is *not* defined.<br/>\n&lt; as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed<br/>\nlearning, nor is it done on a part-time basis&gt;<br/>\nWhat if a child is temporarily unmotivated and wants (and enjoys) some<br/>\nbut not all of his learning to be parent directed? Does this come under<br/>\nthe definition of &quot;unschooling&quot;, and can it be discussed on this forum? <br/>\nI really want to *get it*, but am having trouble because of the mixed<br/>\nsignals on this list lately.

I know it is a control thing, and I<br/>\nhave to get past this aspect, but we only get one chance to do this<br/>\nright. Like I said, I don&#39;t *get it*.
