I don&#39;t listen to what other people say, if I did it would be <br/>\nanother diet. I know when I eat for reasons other than hunger, I don&#39;t come <br/>\naway pleased or satisified, but fatter. <br/>\n<br/>\nDefine hunger? Needing food for fuel. Not for boredom, frustration, feeling <br/>\ntogether with people, celebrating, socializing. I am not a naturally thin <br/>\nperson. I used to be when I was a small child and didn&#39;t have any pressure to <br/>\neat or diet for reasons other than physiological. But when I finally realized <br/>\nthat listening to my body&#39;s hunger mechanism was how I was designed, it made <br/>\nmuch more sense, and resulted in weight loss. I still have a long way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nSex and food, apples and oranges. Both have their allures and their purposes, <br/>\nboth can be misused. I enjoy sex in an intimate, loving, committed, married <br/>\nrelationship. A lot of people use sex for other reasons, physical pleasure <br/>\nbeyond marriage. I did that once too, before marriage. I wish I only waited <br/>\nfor marriage.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoy food the most as it was intended, to fuel my body. I use it for other <br/>\nreasons out of habit and come away miserable, sluggish, burdened. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou go ahead and eat for your reasons, I&#39;ll eat for mine. :0)<br/>\n<br/>\nAng<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62687,"nextTopicId":62695}}
