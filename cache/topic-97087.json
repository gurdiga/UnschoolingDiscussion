It fascinates me.  I used to try to control it <br/>\nmore and worry if someone&#39;s feelings were hurt, and try to find them and <br/>\nexplain more, but the I started to think of it as a river.  This list is like a <br/>\nriver of information flowing all the time.  (Unschooling.com is like a lake with <br/>\ninfusion and evaporation, I guess. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we dam up a river or try to channel it, that&#39;s more work than it&#39;s worth.  <br/>\nIf some people come along and say &quot;I hate rivers, I want a little baggie with <br/>\na small amount of clean water and one easily-seen goldfish,&quot; they&#39;ve come to <br/>\nthe wrong source.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; At first when I read your<br/>\n<br/>\nsuggestion that I should replace the voices in my head with more helpful,<br/>\n<br/>\nsoothing voices, I thought to myself, &quot;Yeah, OK, but I was just joking to<br/>\n<br/>\nillustrate my occassional state of mind.&quot;  But then I realized, that IS my<br/>\n<br/>\nstate of mind and it&#39;s no joke!  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople will blurt out what they don&#39;t even know they believe sometimes.<br/>\nPeople will reveal their deep hurts in the words they choose.<br/>\nSome will deny it, some will even deny having written what we respond to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy least favorite (but fascinating like a train wreck &lt;bwg&gt;) is when someone <br/>\nposts something like, &quot;My kids are lazy brats . . . &quot; in the midst of 300 <br/>\nwords, and then not notice th &#39;brats&#39;,&quot; we can EASILY be in for 300 e-mails of <br/>\nthem saying &quot;I love my kids unconditionally and think only the best of them, how <br/>\ncould you think otherwise, you meanies!?&quot; and others saying &quot;You were so MEAN <br/>\nto that mom who just needed support.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut nobody held a gun to her and said &quot;Type L-A-Z-Y and call them BRATS.  NOW <br/>\nHIT SEND.&quot;    Out of her own mind and fingers came the words.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how much worse when it&#39;s the voices of our parents, grandparents, <br/>\nteachers, critics, who squeak out their little messages when we&#39;re asleep or <br/>\ndistracted or angry?   Those can come out too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes!  I&#39;m glad you wrot what you wrote, Andrea.  Because people&#39;s &quot;just <br/>\njokes&quot; are often not funny at the level at which they reveal fears and beliefs <br/>\nthat weren&#39;t in their top-100-conscious-thoughts.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd who, with young children, can easily HAVE 100 conscious thoughts!?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- Can&#39;t really explain, but I was being hard<br/>\n<br/>\non myself, and not taking myself seriously at the same time. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of the voices I have gradually captured and encapsulated in my mind were <br/>\ntelling me I wasn&#39;t worth taking seriously.   My granny&#39;s declaration &quot;You&#39;re <br/>\nbooksmart, but you just ain&#39;t got no horse sense&quot; (said in different ways at <br/>\ndifferent times).   My mother&#39;s &quot;I love you but I don&#39;t like you sometimes&quot; <br/>\n(when she couldn&#39;t control me to cater to my preschool sister when I got back <br/>\nfrom school, so that she/mom could sit and smoke cigarettes, drink beer and <br/>\nlisten to the radio as though she had no children at all).   <br/>\n<br/>\nI caught them, examined them, figured out why each individual would have <br/>\nthought that was a good thing to choose to say (sometimes the explanations are <br/>\nweak &lt;g&gt;), and I forgave them and turned off their tape!  Now it&#39;s just a museum <br/>\npiece in my head, a reminder of what not to say to my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97081,"nextTopicId":97094}}
