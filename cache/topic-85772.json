The exceptions to &quot;we&quot; are <br/>\nthose people that still live tribally, usually as hunter/gatherers.  (i.e., <br/>\nthe !Kung in Africa.)  Tribal peoples keep their own population down so that <br/>\nthey don&#39;t outgrow their food source.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople of our culture (&quot;Takers&quot; in Ishmael&#39;s lexicon) decided that we would <br/>\nhave no such limits, and have started making all the world about providing food <br/>\nand other goodies for us.  We try to exterminate species that also eat our <br/>\nfood, such as wolves.

Therefore, *we* need it to <br/>\nsurvive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution is not about who gets to reproduce and who doesn&#39;t, because, as <br/>\nyou&#39;ve said (and I agree), it&#39;s icky when people decide that for others.  The <br/>\nsolution is about gradually reducing the food supply.  I know this seems <br/>\ncounter-intuitive when you hear about famines and starvation, but those trends <br/>\nstarted in agrarian societies, not among hunter/gatherers (who just kept walking <br/>\nuntil there *was* food again).  If there is less food (gradually), there will <br/>\nbe fewer of the species that consumes that food.  Ask any biologist.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this is in _Ishmael_.
