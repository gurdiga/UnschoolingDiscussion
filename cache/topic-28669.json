My 3yo dd used to wake up and request ice cream<br/>\nfor breakfast.  I let her....and went ahead and prepared oatmeal,  scrambled<br/>\neggs,  toast,  grits....whatever else I or someone else was having.  She ate<br/>\nice cream a few times....and at times she&#39;d ask for something else.<br/>\n    I did find I had to stay a step ahead of her.  It took an awareness and<br/>\nsome creative work,   but I realized I could change the environment. For<br/>\ninstance,  I began making a concerted effort to have a variety of healthy<br/>\nalternatives, too - like I&#39;d have prepared a bowl of melon chunks.....or<br/>\nmade bueberry puree to put over waffles.....even Carnation Instant<br/>\nBreakfast,  cereal bars,  etc.  The smell of fresh baked bread or bacon and<br/>\neggs was under my control....and it offered her other things to<br/>\nconsider....I&#39;ve even had one dd who makes things like turkey sandwiches for<br/>\nbreakfast...and leftover pizza works well for us!<br/>\n     So I left her alone....she did begin choosing other things.  She<br/>\nsometimes goes on a streak......for quite awhile,   the only vegetable she&#39;d<br/>\neat was sliced fresh red bell peppers (expensive at times!!);  and she still<br/>\neats peanut butter and honey sandwiches almost daily....sometimes 2 or 3 in<br/>\na day!<br/>\n    Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28637,"nextTopicId":28601}}
