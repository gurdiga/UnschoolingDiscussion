Then, all of them were <br/>\nhighly successful in school (I remember a particularlly nauseating <br/>\ndiscussion where they sat around for an hour or so talking about their <br/>\nstratospheric SAT scores) so they simply can&#39;t imagine why school wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nbe a good thing for someone else, as long as you had &quot;good teachers&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;applied yourself.&quot; Meanwhile, we live in a city where the school system is <br/>\na gigantic failure -- kids can&#39;t read, they beat each other up in the <br/>\nhallways, the teachers vanish mid-semester, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own kids are in school, because I do work fulltime. The newspaper here <br/>\ndid a big story on homeschooling recently, and my coworkers all said they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t even bother to read it because it was just such an idiotic notion. <br/>\nThey all declared they could never keep their kids home, and would I? I said <br/>\nwell, yes, I&#39;d thought about it, but that at this point in my life I am <br/>\nworking. They were *stunned*. It shut them up for a while though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think they are reacting in self-defense. Someone else on the list pointed <br/>\nthis out. People always say, &quot;I did it, and I turned out fine.&quot; NOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38031,"nextTopicId":38133}}
