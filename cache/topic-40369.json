And I think there are at least some states <br/>\nwhere there also are none.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What...Are we trying to limit our own freedom?  No. Somebody is behind it.<br/>\n&gt;Let&#39;s agree that it is the NEA and the other school employee unions, who are<br/>\n&gt;trying to influence politicians (whose elections they help pay for) to do<br/>\n&gt;it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can agree that they&#39;re trying, in some places.  It seems to me that in a <br/>\ndemocracy, people have the right to try to influence legislation to suit <br/>\nthem.  And other people have the right to oppose that legislation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In the case in CT this past spring, yes, all it took was one superintendent.<br/>\n&gt;We were told that he was backed by others, but he was the front man. My<br/>\n&gt;point was how easy it was for such a person (a legal agent of the state<br/>\n&gt;school system and therefore with easy access to the legislative process) to<br/>\n&gt;have a law written, sponsored and presented for approval by a legislative<br/>\n&gt;committee so that it could be recommended to the full legislature to be<br/>\n&gt;turned into a LAW that would have virtually eliminated homeschooling from<br/>\n&gt;this state. Homeschoolers in CT had only three working days warning !<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But my point was that superintendents are *not* the NEA.  At least they <br/>\ndon&#39;t belong to the union here in BC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Yes, the NEA is the force behind all the efforts to eliminate homeschooling<br/>\n&gt;in America. The NEA, you can be sure, put that superintendent up to it, even<br/>\n&gt;helped write his script for the hearing, and paid for lawyers to help write<br/>\n&gt;the law. The NEA pays lobbyists in every state capitol and in DC especially,<br/>\n&gt;and their goal is to fight against our rights to educate our own children.<br/>\n&gt;To them, it&#39;s a business, and they&#39;re well organized and have truckloads of<br/>\n&gt;money.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Amazing how unsuccessful they&#39;ve been then.  Really.  The number of <br/>\nhomeschoolers is going up, not down.  And more and more people from all <br/>\ndifferent walks of life are homeschooling, including teachers.  My cousin <br/>\nis a teacher who says she wishes she had homeschooled her kids.  She didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow then that it was possible.  She actually helped influence my son to <br/>\ndecide not to try high school this year.  Teachers see what goes on in the <br/>\nschools, and a lot of them don&#39;t like it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Are you suggesting that this is trivial?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s trivial, but it reminds me of some of the people in the <br/>\n50&#39;s, who saw communists under every bed.  I just don&#39;t believe in the big <br/>\nconspiracy theory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Are you suggesting that it is not<br/>\n&gt;likely ever to happen or that it really can&#39;t have serious consequences for<br/>\n&gt;unschoolers?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree that you had a threat in your state.  It seems to have been stopped <br/>\nby homeschoolers working against it.  Democracy in action.  I don&#39;t believe <br/>\nthat government bureaucrats sit around all day dreaming up ways to force <br/>\nhomeschoolers into the schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In my own prepared short speech to that committee (which I<br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t get a chance to give) I was ready to tell the lawmakers that<br/>\n&gt;everything my wife and I did in order to assure that our child was getting<br/>\n&gt;educated would have been ILLEGAL under the law they were considering, and<br/>\n&gt;our son would probably have been taken from our home and put in the &quot;care&quot;<br/>\n&gt;of welfare and social workers at state-run foster homes, all because of our<br/>\n&gt;unschooling. I would however, in my defense, have told them that our<br/>\n&gt;family&#39;s total absence of schooling was the main reason why our son had the<br/>\n&gt;tools to attend a fine college and achieve at the highest possible academic<br/>\n&gt;levels for four straight years and graduate Magna Cum Laude.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Would have been a good speech.  Too bad you didn&#39;t get to give it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Unschoolers are in the same war as all other homeschoolers. I don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt;that is Off Topic at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not in a war.  One of many reasons why I left the U.S. is the tendency <br/>\nthere to turn everything into a war.  (war on poverty, war on drugs, <br/>\netc.)  I&#39;m really a pretty peaceable person.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you think of me is none of my business.<br/>\n*********************************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":36888606,"authorName":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare","from":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare &lt;nedvare@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: 2213 NEA vs homeschooling","postDate":"1028865931","msgId":40369,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5NzhBNzZFLjEyM0ElbmVkdmFyZUBudHBseC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjg4MzI1NTYuMTYwOC4yMTE3My5tMTBAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":40381,"prevInTime":40368,"nextInTime":40370,"topicId":40369,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
