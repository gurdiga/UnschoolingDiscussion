My children are young, 3yo and <br/>\n8mo, so I will be very curious to read other responses to your message.  I <br/>\nonly allow an hour of TV for my 3 yo and it is only PBS child shows or videos <br/>\nthat I have previously watched.  I do this mostly because she is too young to <br/>\nunderstand some situations and has a vivid and wild imagination...I know your <br/>\nchildren are much older but I do believe I will monitor my childrens amount <br/>\nand content of TV.  I think my main reason will be that I will want my <br/>\nchildren to watch shows that have a high moral content (not sure if this is <br/>\nthe right way to say it).  I personally do not believe it can be healthy for <br/>\nmy children to watch wrestling or mob movies without parental supervision (or <br/>\nat all in some instances).. Even at this young age of 3 I watch shows WITH my <br/>\ndaughter, to expand on topics, relate topics to OUR dialy lives or explain <br/>\nwhy WE as a family don&#39;t do some of the things she sees, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI kinda spewed off (I&#39;ve been away from e-mail for several days!!) but wanted <br/>\nto share my thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nMichelle in DE</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12688,"nextTopicId":12712}}
