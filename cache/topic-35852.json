Spelling, <br/>\n&gt; in my opinion, is counter-intuitive.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And, although I very strongly believe that spelling<br/>\n&gt; is important, I generally <br/>\n&gt; try to look past spelling, and to read for content. <br/>\n&gt; Words in a properly <br/>\n&gt; spelled sentence are easier to read than are words<br/>\n&gt; in an improperly spelled <br/>\n&gt; sentence.

One 8-year-old girl who hardly every plays outside but who has been out more recently said to my 8-year-old daughter, &quot;My mom [a high school teacher] said that homeschool kids don&#39;t really learn anything.&quot; I asked, with more trepidation than I expected to feel, &quot;So what did you say to her?&quot; Alexandra replied, &quot;I told her, &#39;That&#39;s not true.&#39;&quot; And off she ran.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my hunch. Because homeschooling, and especially unschooling, is a life choice that implicitly judges schools as not optimum places for kids and their learning, folks who send their kids to schools might feel that we who don&#39;t are thereby judging them. They respond to percieved criticisms of their choices by becoming defensive or by attacking. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be true that I think our choice is best for us, but I also think it&#39;s a pretty good choice in general. I see many families who could probably be happier if they let go of the expectation that learning happens best in schools and if they rid themselves of this idea that it&#39;s not fun to be with their children most days. So, in a sense, my actions do reflect a judgement. I don&#39;t, however, tell my kids that &quot;school kids don&#39;t learn anything.&quot; We talk about freedom and choices more than academic-type stuff. I don&#39;t want them to dismiss or to be afraid of school because the day might come when they want to go. Plus, to think of schools that way is mighty disrespectful of all the people who have been schooled and who have done great and wonderful things, so we try to focus on balance. <br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"questioning others","postDate":"1019664054","msgId":35852,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk4LjI0ZDE0YTAyLjI5ZjgzMGI2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":35892,"prevInTime":35851,"nextInTime":35853,"topicId":35852,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/24/02 8:45:26 AM, rumpleteasermom@juno.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-714092849\">In a message dated 4/24/02 8:45:26 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rumpleteasermom@...\">rumpleteasermom@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; My second thought is that you seem to be saying that any homeschooler <br/>\nor parent for that matter who doesn&#39;t take to unschooling must not <br/>\nrespect their children properly.  So is that really what you think? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is asked in such a way it might be hard for it to be answered calmly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can&#39;t (nor can any one person among us) make everyone happy.  The world is <br/>\na big place, and luckily we&#39;re not responsible for making even any one single <br/>\nperson happy on this list, or in our homes, or anywhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople are free to move around (especially those on the internet!) and if <br/>\nthey&#39;re in pain, one click of the mouse takes the stimulus away.  (Remember <br/>\nBill Cosby&#39;s &quot;Chicken Heart&quot; routine?  The solution was &quot;TURN OFF THE RADIO!&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a clearly marked unschooling list, unschooling advice is to be expected.  <br/>\nIf in a specifically discussed incident (like &quot;I make my kids practice piano <br/>\nan hour a day&quot;) it would not be unreasonable for someone to say &quot;If a child <br/>\nis wanting to take a two week or two year break from piano, couldn&#39;t you <br/>\nrespect the child&#39;s wishes?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would be a definite suggestion that putting the hour of practice ahead <br/>\nof the child&#39;s feelings about the practice could be disrespectful.  It&#39;s a <br/>\ndefinite invitation for the parent to reconsider priorities.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can&#39;t be expected to make all UNSCHOOLERS happy, so let&#39;s not move toward <br/>\nwanting to make all unschoolers AND structured schoolers happy.  Nobody&#39;s <br/>\ndoing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wouldn&#39;t be okay to interrupt church to say &quot;So are you really saying that <br/>\nthose who don&#39;t believe as you do could go to hell for it?&quot;   Or to interrupt <br/>\na Kirby vaccuum sales pitch to say, &quot;SO, you&#39;re saying these are stronger and <br/>\nbetter made than Hoovers?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone believes something strongly, they believe it to be better than <br/>\nthose other options they considered and moved away from to get where they <br/>\nare.  Those who have stopped smoking think that is a better thing than two <br/>\npacks a day.  Those who used to drink but have stopped probably do NOT sit <br/>\naround thinking, &quot;Gee.... I&#39;m sure I&#39;m no better off than when I was drinking <br/>\na case of beer a day...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who go to AA could come out and say &quot;He called me a drunk!  He <br/>\nsuggested perhaps I&#39;m not as respectful to my family while I&#39;m drinking as I <br/>\ncould be!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAA sponsors don&#39;t go door to door in pairs saying, &quot;Do you know about <br/>\nAlcoholics Anonymous?  Would you like to know more?&quot;  People go to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd people come to unschooling lists to find out about unschooling.  If we <br/>\nwater it down to a really comfortable, evasive, mushy vague thing, they won&#39;t <br/>\nlearn bout unschooling.  If we don&#39;t ask them to question their attitudes and <br/>\npriorities, they might not come to question them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor personal enlightenment, people have their whole lives.  <br/>\nFor getting from a frustrating place of homeschooling not working to a <br/>\ncomfortable unschooling place, some families have fifteen years stretching <br/>\nout in front of them.  Some have three, and they need some quicker advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this were run as a school-style course of study, we would have a new batch <br/>\nof people all at once, and the first week could be really soft and gentle, <br/>\nand we could build up to the hard stuff gradually over twelve weeks or <br/>\nwhatever.  But people come here for a day, or a year.  We don&#39;t know how long <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be here.  Some people come for a while, go away and think, and come <br/>\nback.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people (in any class, or at any AA, church, piano school, work party) <br/>\ndon&#39;t REALLY intend to learn in good faith.  They&#39;re there because someone <br/>\nmade them be, or they&#39;re there because their friend is, or because they want <br/>\nto go, check it out, prove they don&#39;t like it, and tell someone (mom? <br/>\nhusband? kids?) &quot;Okay, I tried it.
