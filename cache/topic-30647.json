Not as a punishment, but as a relief from the burden.<br/>\nFor example, once when my son was being teased about being homeschooled on<br/>\nhis baseball team, we discussed his options (quitting, ignoring it,<br/>\ndiscussing it w/ the coach, etc.) and then I expressed my confidence in his<br/>\nability to make a good decision about it.  When he was still struggling with<br/>\nit later, I told him that if he wanted me to make a decision for him, I<br/>\nwould.  But he decided he could do it for himself and he did.
