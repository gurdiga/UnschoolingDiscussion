I waver between burnt out cook and feed yourself often. On weeks where I ask everyone for favorite meals, things go so much smoother. I write down 2-3 meals per kid and shop with the list in hand. Our meals are spaghetti, fish, chicken and rice, anything BBQ, sloppy joes, tacos/burritoes, soups I make from scratch, enchiladas, breakfast for dinner(pancakes, eggs) pizza and take out. I definately believe the whining child who can&#39;t find something to eat is also asking for some focused attention. I have one who constantly whines over food when she needs one-on-one with me. Helping her make meals she likes satisfies her need for connection with me.She says she wants me to make it for her and when I do she is partial satiated.

A simple no thank you or  I&#39;ll make my self tuna is much easier to stomach than chicken and rice gross mom, why do you always cook what he wants. I enjoy cooking large quanities that freeze up or turn into other meals. My son can&#39;t be home when we cook beans, olfactory overload.
