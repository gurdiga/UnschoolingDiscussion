As this turned out longer than I expected,<br/>\nI&#39;ll phrase my request first: does anybody have copies they can forward to me of<br/>\nthe digests from the list, numbers 1- 28 inclusive?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am Mandy Tyler, my children are Aedan (6) and Keszia (5); I&#39;m in<br/>\nWest Auckland, New Zealand.  My partner is Lance; his daughter Meagan is 8.5 and also<br/>\nhomeschooled.  (I may as well admit it now, her mother and I get on<br/>\nreally well!  Some people find that really strange.  Oh yes, and my<br/>\nex-husband and I actually get on as well.  Weird, huh?).  All 3 children<br/>\nare using the Oak Meadow curriculum as a jumping-off point - it is very Rudolf<br/>\nSteiner-ish in philosophy and we&#39;re really enjoying it.  Covering the<br/>\nbasics but lots of fun involved as well.  We do a couple of hours of<br/>\nthis 3 mornings a week, and the other two mornings go to a playgroup<br/>\n(not a homeschool one, but really enjoyable).  The rest of the time the<br/>\nkids unschool..  The kids also go to swimming lessons on Saturday mornings<br/>\nwith their dad, and spend time with him every weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried unschooling in 1997 without any curriculum while the kids<br/>\nwere younger, and really enjoyed it.  The only reason we bought a<br/>\ncurriculum at all last year was basically my own insecurity.  We well<br/>\nand truly proved that lots gets done in each subject using<br/>\nunschooling...do I explain the signature line at the end of my message?<br/>\nI kept daily records of everything the kids did for all of last year,<br/>\nand much to my surprise Eleanor of the Home Educators list in Australia<br/>\noffered to publish it for me.  It is basically a report about what we<br/>\nachieved in each subject last year, using the relaxed unschooling<br/>\nmethod.  The kids were 4 and 3 at the time. There are about 4000<br/>\neducational references to things we did, under the appropriate subject<br/>\nheadings.  It would be particularly useful to (a) people starting out<br/>\nhomeschooling; (b) people who don&#39;t understand how unschooling can work,<br/>\n(c) parents with preschoolers interested in homeschooling them and (d)<br/>\npeople looking for a method of record-keeping. It includes about 50<br/>\nphotos/copies of the children&#39;s work.  It can be purchased directly<br/>\nthrough me for US$20 including p&p.  I hope that didn&#39;t seem like a shameless plug!<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have an enormous list of bookmarked sites divided into subject<br/>\nareas, - hotlink for this in my sig line - and I run the New Zealand Unschoolers list, on<br/>\nwhich there are about 40 members.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a serious addict of the overseas homeschooling email lists, as well as<br/>\nUnschooling-dotcom 8-) - the US ones: Home-ed list, Unschooling List, Unschoolers Circle,<br/>\nyounglearners; and also of course there is my own list and the other (main) NZ<br/>\nhomeschooling<br/>\nlist, Hefnet.  Among others.  Oh dear - how shall I find time to read it all!! 8-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, this is long enough for a first post - I shall enjoy getting to<br/>\nknow everybody more as the list progresses!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMandy Tyler<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n|=============================================================|<br/>\n Mandy Tyler (mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blondie@...\">blondie@...</a>) (New Zealand) My Book �Unschooling Instead�:<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unveiling.org/resources/mtyler.htm\">http://www.unveiling.org/resources/mtyler.htm</a>     My Homeschooling Bookmarks:<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/mandyssite\">http://members.xoom.com/mandyssite</a>    My NZ Unschoolers List: Email:<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nzunschoolers-request@...\">nzunschoolers-request@...</a> �subscribe� in body (New Zealanders ONLY)<br/>\n NZ Home Educators <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/astley/homeeduc.htm\">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/astley/homeeduc.htm</a><br/>\n|=============================================================|</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":435,"nextTopicId":478}}
