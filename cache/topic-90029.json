He might for awhile until he finds other things he wants<br/>\nto do, but he wont always and only want TV forever.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***his behaviour worsens, he gets headaches ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might rub his shoulders if he&#39;s been sitting for a long time.  You<br/>\ncould bring him snacks to keep his energy up.  You might watch with him<br/>\nso he feels your support instead of your worry - if he&#39;s felt that, and<br/>\nthose things might make him more comfortable and let you feel like you&#39;re<br/>\nworking with him instead of against him.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***and isnt&#39;t active or using his imagination when he&#39;s stuck in front of<br/>\nthe box all the time.***<br/>\n<br/>\nCan he bounce on the furniture and hop around and stand on his head?

I know there are a<br/>\nlot of mainstream theories about the evils of TV, but if you let go of<br/>\nthat and trust your kids, you&#39;ll come to all kinds of new thinking on the<br/>\nsubject. <br/>\n<br/>\n***He also plays constantly, mostly with my eldest daughter.

Some legislators are pushing for<br/>\nmandatory preschool for three year olds because kids are learning so much<br/>\nin those early years, and they think (among other things)  they can give<br/>\nthem a early start.  But the reason kids learn so much before they&#39;re<br/>\nfive is because they are free to play.  After that parents start fussing<br/>\nabout school work and teachers start pushing reading and all at once your<br/>\nbright kid who learned to walk and talk and dress himself and feed<br/>\nhimself, ride a bike - who can name every dinosaur found in the Hell<br/>\nCreek formation and work the dvd player and master countless, challenging<br/>\nvideo games is suddenly learning disabled, or disordered or something.  <br/>\nHmmm. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet him play.    <br/>\n<br/>\n*** Do you think parents and children have to be of a certain personality<br/>\nto successfully unschool?***<br/>\n<br/>\nYes.  Parents have to believe learning is natural and they have to trust<br/>\ntheir kids.  They have to look at their kids and see what&#39;s right about<br/>\nthem, not what others think might be wrong.  They have to see value in<br/>\neverything in life.  They have to see value in their kids choices.  They<br/>\nhave to really like their kids and want to be with them. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I feel I&#39;ve made so many mistakes, ***<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery parent feels that way.  We all have things we&#39;d change if we could.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone who is unschooling now had to think about the difference between<br/>\na life with school and a life without.

People who put their kids in school on the theory (usually <br/>\nunexamined) that it&#39;s the best place for them to become successful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least I had really thought my &quot;theory&quot; through and was involved every <br/>\nsingle day of my life, unlike this guy, whose kids were going to be in school.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It is hard, and it must be frustrating for those of you who have been <br/>\n<br/>\nunschooling for years, but please bear with me.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, but for your part could you read with the knowledge that everyone had to <br/>\nstep away from the school and let a lot of their own upbringing, fears, inner <br/>\nvoices and &quot;knowledge&quot; go?    <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Once the tv is on he is stuck. The house could be on fire and he <br/>\n<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be able to rouse himself. He is like a total zombie and <br/>\n<br/>\ncannot talk or hear apparently when the set is on.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I don&#39;t believe it, and it&#39;s a rude thing to say and to have thought <br/>\nabout your child, that he could be in a burning house and not respond.  Very <br/>\ncold.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are reasons children will ignore other input.  My younger cousin who <br/>\nhad been abused and neglected, abandoned, taken away by the state and finally <br/>\ncame to live with us would get stuck to the TV.  She didn&#39;t hear adults talk to <br/>\nher, but she heard other kids.  She had just heard all the adult nonsense she <br/>\ncould stand and didn&#39;t want to hear any more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s watching something that&#39;s really interesting and you interrupt right <br/>\nin the middle of a speech, you were wrong and he was right.  If it&#39;s a video <br/>\nor DVD, ask him to pause it.  If it&#39;s a tv show, wait for the commercial.   If <br/>\nyou have been yelling fire in the theatre just to test him, or treating him as <br/>\nthough your slightest utterance is more important than his near-hour <br/>\ninvestment in a story, he might be learning to tune out in self defense.    And this <br/>\nmight NOT apply, but I&#39;m braving such a guess because of the disdainful words <br/>\nyou choose when discussing this.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you only interrupt if it&#39;s really important, I bet he will start paying <br/>\nattention to your interruptions.  But otherwise, it would be like someone <br/>\npicking up a book you&#39;d been reading for a week, tearing out the last chapter and <br/>\nthrowing it in the fire.  Or maybe just the one page you&#39;re on.   You can miss <br/>\nthat page.  If not, books have too much of a hold over you.  You&#39;re a zombie.  <br/>\nBooks should be banned from your life because when you were reading you were <br/>\nignoring the world around you.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Not sure if anyone <br/>\n<br/>\nhas read/heard of the book &quot;Set Free Childhood&quot; about television and <br/>\n<br/>\nhow it affects the brain etc. Not comfortable reading and one I <br/>\n<br/>\nsometimes wish I hadn&#39;t read.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read three anti-TV books, but not that one.<br/>\nThey were all nonsense from the same source, it seemed to me.<br/>\nReally.  <br/>\nEven when I didn&#39;t have kids to be fearful about I read one and it seemed so <br/>\ntrite and unscientific and based on prejudice that I was embarrassed for him.  <br/>\nBut when prejudice abounds, people will welcome what seems like support for <br/>\ntheir prejudice.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Well, obviously he&#39;s not doing the two things constantly <br/>\n<br/>\nsimultaneously. I had been limiting the tv but if I hadn&#39;t those <br/>\n<br/>\nwould be the two things he would be doing but at different times.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd neither of those (watching TV and playing) is a bad thing to be doing.   <br/>\nAnd if he&#39;s doing even just TWO things at the same time, you wronged him by <br/>\nsaying &quot;constantly.&quot;   His life should merit your honest and loving regard.  <br/>\nYou&#39;re writing of him here in a way that suggests a lack of direct seeing of him, <br/>\nhimself, as the man he will be after you&#39;re gone.   He&#39;s just the young <br/>\nversion of his whole self.  He&#39;s real now.  He&#39;s whole now.  He&#39;s not a lump you <br/>\ncan insult and control and mold.   He can be seen that way, but it won&#39;t create <br/>\na good relationship between you and him.   It won&#39;t help you see that what he <br/>\nis learning now is what he will grow up with.  Please try not to have him <br/>\nlearn that his mom doesn&#39;t think much of him and doesn&#39;t see him clearly.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And <br/>\n<br/>\nwhile I know playing is great I also know that people do need to <br/>\n<br/>\nlearn to read and write and be numerate and I had thought that at 7 <br/>\n<br/>\nthis desire might kick in. Maybe I expect too much.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re expecting to much and too soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here&#39;s what I don&#39;t think you do know:   <br/>\nReading and writing and mathematics can come from playing video games, <br/>\nplaying with other children, and watching TV and movies.   They can come from <br/>\nplaying with Lego and other construction things, especially if you get books and <br/>\nmagazines with patterns, pictures of other people&#39;s creations with captions.  <br/>\nPlayers&#39; guides for video games.  TV schedules.  Books or magazines with <br/>\ninformation on his favorite movies or TV shows could help, but NOT if you get them and <br/>\ntry to make him read aloud to you.  If you get them and read them TO him, or <br/>\njust let him look at the photos, and then put them aside in a safe place for <br/>\nhim so he can come back and read them later.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome families throw out too much stuff.  Kirby has ever issue of Nintendo <br/>\nPower he ever got.  We bought him magazine boxes and helped him keep them in <br/>\norder.  He bought an index with his own money before he could even read, and would <br/>\nask me to look things up.   Because of that index, he learned the notation <br/>\nthat is also used in much research, the Bible, Shakespeare, which is that if the <br/>\nindex said 15:38 it meant issue #15, page 38.  That prevented the need EVER <br/>\nfor explaining what future notations would mean.  Doesn&#39;t matter, either, that <br/>\nShakespeare notations will use Roman numerals in part, because he learned <br/>\nRoman numerals from playing Mega Man.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could ramble on, and in the course of my life I do. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know we can help you feel better about natural learning, and I know it&#39;s a <br/>\nhard step to take.    If you&#39;re able to, in May, there is a big home education <br/>\ncamp-out called HesFes in the south of England somewhere and you could look <br/>\nit up on the internet, or ask on a local list if you&#39;re hooked up there <br/>\nalready.  If you went there you would probably meet lots of families of different <br/>\npersuasions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was lucky, before I even thought of homeschooling, to be in a babysitting <br/>\nco-op/playgroup with a +/- a dozen families (once as many as 18) and four <br/>\nfamilies homeschooled.  Two used structure and curriculum and rules and one poor gir<br/>\nl kept being left home, losing the privilege of coming to the park to play <br/>\nbecause she hadn&#39;t &quot;done her math,&quot; or she would be left in the car where she <br/>\ncould see the kids playing but couldn&#39;t get out.   Two families were <br/>\nunschoolers, and I saw how close the parents were with the children, how when the <br/>\nchildren talked the parents really listened, patiently, and happily, and that the <br/>\nchildren WANTED to be with their parents.  I wanted that for my family, so when <br/>\nit became apparent that Kirby and kindergarten weren&#39;t a match, I didn&#39;t even <br/>\nconsider the structured way.  I didn&#39;t want that animosity, that &quot;us and them,&quot; <br/>\nthat disdain.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":101672438,"authorName":"Diane","from":"Diane &lt;cen46624@...&gt;","profile":"thegreatdiane","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: A warm hello from the UK- and some questions!","postDate":"1075738121","msgId":90086,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwMUU3NjA5LjMwNDA1MDZAdm9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGJ2bGN2ZitiNWtmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGJ2bGN2ZitiNWtmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":90080,"nextInTopic":90087,"prevInTime":90085,"nextInTime":90087,"topicId":90029,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So we don&#39;t do too much tv here; we do mostly<br/>\nvideos and DVDs. This is partly out of habit, I guess. But that&#39;s what the<br/>\nkids have grown up doing as well--pop in a video when they want to watch<br/>\nsomething. They know tv is out there and that there&#39;s fun stuff on it, but<br/>\nsomehow they associate it more with hotels than home. *g*<br/>\n<br/>\nSome days are &quot;watching days&quot; around here. Maybe somebody&#39;s sick or it&#39;s<br/>\nreally cold out. Maybe we&#39;ve just been going full speed for a while and need<br/>\nto relax. Point is, this goes in waves or spurts. We might watch lots of<br/>\nmovies for a while, but then we&#39;re off doing other things, having other<br/>\ninterests. In our lives, I don&#39;t think any one thing predominates. For a<br/>\nweek or so, it may seem like all we do is watch movies. For another week,<br/>\nwe&#39;re really into board games. Lately, we&#39;ve been really into Majesty--a new<br/>\ncastle sim game that we got for the computer. Felt like we were playing it<br/>\nall the time. Sometimes I&#39;d play by myself; I&#39;d play with dh or even 3<br/>\nplayers with our 6 yo over wireless. We were having fun and getting into a<br/>\nnew game. But that&#39;s slowing down now. (Well, dh is still geeking out,<br/>\nreading cheats and walkthroughs on his laptop while playing on the big<br/>\ncomputer. *g*) Next week, I&#39;m guessing we&#39;ll be hunkered down reading Harry<br/>\nPotter because we just watched the first two movies, which we borrowed from<br/>\nthe library.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling&#39;s kind of like the stock market: you have to be in it for the<br/>\nlong haul and look at the big picture. It&#39;s not all ups and it&#39;s not all<br/>\ndowns, but from a narrow perspective it may look that way. Pull your<br/>\ninvestment too soon, and you&#39;ve missed the big payoff for focusing only on<br/>\nthe immediate circumstance. Of course, the analogy falls apart when you<br/>\nthink about the big crash--unschooling would never do that! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle, who should really have more coffee before attempting analogies!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":31945013,"authorName":"Joan Labbe & Salvatore Genovese","from":"&quot;Joan Labbe & Salvatore Genovese&quot; &lt;salgenovese@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] A warm hello from the UK- and some questions!","postDate":"1075644695","msgId":90046,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEhJRVBLT09FRUlBSUJISFBKRUJQT0VBR0NLQUEuc2FsZ2Vub3Zlc2VAd29ybGRuZXQuYXR0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyYS4zYTc1NjAwZC4yZDRlNjEwOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":90045,"nextInTopic":90047,"prevInTime":90045,"nextInTime":90047,"topicId":90029,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I mean like eating sweets (my son is the one with the endless sweet tooth also while my daughter eats a bit then gets tired of it) - I attempt to go with","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1834450071\">I mean like eating sweets (my son is the one with the endless sweet tooth<br/>\nalso while my daughter eats a bit then gets tired of it) - I attempt to go<br/>\nwith minimal limits to things in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrossedd@...\">jrossedd@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrossedd@...\">jrossedd@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, February 01, 2004 9:03 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] A warm hello from the UK- and some<br/>\nquestions!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:salgenovese@...\">salgenovese@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So I set a limit on them of a number per day my<br/>\n&gt; son can watch which he respects like he respects limits to other things<br/>\n&gt; which his Mom thinks are great in small amounts but not so great if he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; doing them all day long.
