We <br/>\nwere discussing the state of the SCA, which is 36 years old now, and he and I <br/>\nhave been in for 26 and 27 years (he the longer).    He&#39;s on an e-mail list of <br/>\n&quot;royal peers&quot; (former royalty) and said they were discussing that the median <br/>\nage of the SCA is getting older and older.  One Duke in the West Kingdom (he&#39;s <br/>\nin Northern California, where the SCA began, and has been in nearly the whole <br/>\ntime) said that if, when he was younger, there had been the quality of video <br/>\ngames kids have now, he probably would never have joined the SCA.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have been in the SCA since they were born, so they just take it for <br/>\ngranted.  They can&#39;t help but learn from all the things going on around them, <br/>\nand both the boys have been in armor, and both have had boffers (foam swords) <br/>\nsince they were toddlers.  They have costumes galore, and personalized <br/>\nperiodesque mugs, and have camped in their own period tents, etc.   But their current <br/>\nfavorite game is a medieval fantasy thing, and Marty was joyous when he woke <br/>\nup today and found Kirby had already gone to work.  He&#39;s been up there most of <br/>\nthe day playing that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe art work on the game is really wonderful.  Morrowind.
