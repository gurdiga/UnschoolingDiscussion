Andersen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andersen@...\">andersen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: Undisclosed-Recipient &lt;Undisclosed-Recipient&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, November 11, 1999 10:07 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Books and the Internet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;John O. Andersen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andersen@...\">andersen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m beginning to revise my thinking on reading books.  One year a few years<br/>\n&gt;back I set a personal record by reading 122 books.  That was a lot of fun,<br/>\n&gt;but after awhile, the tallying took on a life of its own, overshadowing<br/>\n&gt;perhaps some of the other more important reasons for reading such as mind<br/>\n&gt;broadening or relaxation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yes, I&#39;m still a book lover.  I go to the library at least twice a week.<br/>\n&gt;Non-fiction is my preference by far.  I pick out all sorts of books which<br/>\n&gt;interest me: travel, hiking, history, poetry, social issues, books on<br/>\n&gt;photography, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;These days, however, I rarely read a book from cover to cover.  I simply<br/>\n&gt;read the bits which interest me.  This is because my time for reading is<br/>\n&gt;limited, and once I&#39;ve gleaned what I want to from one book, I&#39;m usually<br/>\n&gt;anxious to move on to the next.  Practically the only books I read cover to<br/>\n&gt;cover are the ones I read to my children at night before they go to bed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s more and more apparent to me that while books are still excellent<br/>\n&gt;sources of information, the Internet is quickly becoming a worthy rival.<br/>\n&gt;The Internet enables easy access to a mind-boggling array of news and<br/>\n&gt;information sources.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Personally,  I get my news from several respected American sites as well as<br/>\n&gt;a few foreign websites.  Often when a story hits which piques my curiosity,<br/>\n&gt;I go directly to the news website of the city where the event is happening.<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s great fun to get foreign perspectives on news happening in the United<br/>\n&gt;States.  I love the availability of demographic and geographic information<br/>\n&gt;as well.  My growing network of Internet friends/acquaintances is also<br/>\n&gt;invaluable in that we send each other links, articles and other discoveries<br/>\n&gt;we find interesting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In the long run, electronic information sources will diminish the relative<br/>\n&gt;importance of printed books, but won&#39;t eliminate them entirely.  I&#39;m just<br/>\n&gt;happy to live in an age when the number of easily accesssible information<br/>\n&gt;sources has exploded.  Surely there has never been a better time in the<br/>\n&gt;history of the world to undertake the task of self-education.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;John<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/joandersen\">http://members.xoom.com/joandersen</a><br/>\n&gt;Usually it&#39;s easier to be a &quot;success&quot; than to be a human.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Check it out!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"MORELFAM@xxx.xxx","from":"MORELFAM@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"L6-E8y9JGpbZ6nc6eyRTC5SF7_ufN00y3Gv_ViDD5qjW-KbSDVXgHAQUe58lQuFq--o4G7u6hg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: Books and the Internet","postDate":"942639046","msgId":4547,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yOTguNDU0Ny45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4497,"nextInTopic":4548,"prevInTime":4546,"nextInTime":4548,"topicId":4448,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/13/99 9:32:43 AM, pamhartley@mindspring.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1544355998\">In a message dated 11/13/99 9:32:43 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamhartley@...\">pamhartley@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; you know what?

I am getting so much information these days on<br/>\nthe areas that I am actively studying from participating in lists I am on,<br/>\nreading information on websites, and having conversations with other<br/>\n(online and off.)  I would hate to think that this information was any less<br/>\nimportant or worthy than info I got from a book.  Some books are, to say<br/>\nthe least, really lame and a waste of time, whereas if you feel you are not<br/>\ngetting what you need from the internet, you can turn it off and you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to wait until you get to the &quot;end&quot; to determine it&#39;s value.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my schedule the way it is, I have a very limited amount of time in<br/>\nwhich to read books, but I also have essential reasons to need to gather<br/>\ninformation right now.  We are adopting a child and are required to do<br/>\neducational reading and classes on special needs children.  But I also get<br/>\na great deal of wonderful information from internet sources.  I am also<br/>\ntaking classes (in the real world) focusing on theology and spiritualism<br/>\nfor my own personal growth and find more info and a place to discuss<br/>\nclasses and ideas with others on the internet.  That is an opportunity I<br/>\nreally cherise, because I do not get out much when I spend all my days<br/>\ncaring for two babies.     <br/>\n<br/>\nI am also discovering medical information for my &quot;special needs&quot; eldest<br/>\nchild who has severe allergies and sensativites, and I am able to educate<br/>\nmyself about his conditions and how various approaches may affect him, or<br/>\nhow I can make sure he gets a nutritionally complete diet while avoiding<br/>\nhis allergens.  Not to mention the medical information that I find for<br/>\nmyself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is the fact that, with 2 toddlers in diapers at home, a part<br/>\ntime job on the weekends, an adoption ongoing with all the work it entails,<br/>\nand a house that is in the process of being remodeled, I have no time to<br/>\nshop for the holidays.  I also have a three year old&#39;s birthday to plan<br/>\n(12-22) and my DH&#39;s birthday (12-16) to shop and plan for.  So I shop<br/>\nonline!  And I just bought the greatest slightly used London Fog full lenth<br/>\nwinter coat for DH and a big toy castle for the almost three year old.  It<br/>\nis next to impossiible for me to get out and shop without the boys, and<br/>\nforget about DH not knowing what I am up to if I have to arrange special<br/>\ntime to go out and shop by myself.  Plus the fact that I HATE shopping in<br/>\ngeneral, crowds, malls, sales people, etc.  ICK!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there is so much information and so many opportunities on the internet<br/>\nthat make my life easier and more enriched.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bonknit@xxx.xxx","from":"Bonknit@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"4e6GN2MqAdsWM_k2_Bz_GshXMMokvm4buKIxiZ2iUNtja7focq-h39qKvMxFZYNlQpRtlgph","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: Books and the Internet","postDate":"942511231","msgId":4493,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yOTYuNDQ5My45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4486,"nextInTopic":4497,"prevInTime":4492,"nextInTime":4494,"topicId":4448,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/13/99 10:32:46 AM Eastern Standard Time, pamhartley@mindspring.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1559085357\">In a message dated 11/13/99 10:32:46 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamhartley@...\">pamhartley@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; And you know what?

Do you think our experiences with<br/>\nthe types of information (lots of short pieces) from TV and the internet have<br/>\naffected the way we read printed materials?

One year a few years<br/>\nback I set a personal record by reading 122 books.  That was a lot of fun,<br/>\nbut after awhile, the tallying took on a life of its own, overshadowing<br/>\nperhaps some of the other more important reasons for reading such as mind<br/>\nbroadening or relaxation.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I&#39;m still a book lover.  I go to the library at least twice a week.<br/>\nNon-fiction is my preference by far.  I pick out all sorts of books which<br/>\ninterest me: travel, hiking, history, poetry, social issues, books on<br/>\nphotography, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days, however, I rarely read a book from cover to cover.
