I have a 4 yo <br/>\nds that I&#39;m helping get ready - so I just call reminders down the hall to my <br/>\n15 yo&#39;s room while I&#39;m helping the 4 yo.  The older one also doesn&#39;t care for <br/>\npajamas - so he takes a shower in the evening and puts on his clothes for the <br/>\nnext day - leaving us one less hurdle &lt;g&gt;.  He also will put whatever he <br/>\nneeds to bring in the car, either the night before or after breakfast (he <br/>\nthought that one up).<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving, possibly, just a few more years before he&#39;s out on his own, though, <br/>\nI&#39;m worrying about it less.  The flip side of his being so focused on what <br/>\nhe&#39;s doing, rather than other things going on or coming up, is that he&#39;s very <br/>\nenjoyable to do things with because he *is* focused very much in the moment.  <br/>\nWe were at a botanical garden on Tuesday (he wanted to go there for his <br/>\nbirthday), and, while I thought there wouldn&#39;t be much going on there, he <br/>\npointed out *so* many birds (and knew them all too), and he even found a <br/>\nchipmunk (which I&#39;ve never seen before there). He&#39;s incredibly observant - <br/>\nand enjoys everything so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, my 11 yo dd will be up, dressed, have all her stuff together and be <br/>\nwaiting in her jacket out in the car 10 minutes before we have to leave.  I <br/>\nrarely have to remind her of anything - but that&#39;s because she&#39;s *so* worried <br/>\nabout being late or missing something.
