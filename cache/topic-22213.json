It&#39;s too bad that an attitude<br/>\n&gt; has developed among homeschoolers who think &#39;that person isn&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling&#39; because they aren&#39;t doing it exactly as THEY would<br/>\n&gt; define it. I mean, I&#39;ve met people who wouldn&#39;t consider anyone truly<br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers unless they&#39;re doing it for religious reasons.<br/>\n&gt; Obviously, there are lots of us who would argue against that<br/>\n&gt; definition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The point is that if you live in a state that makes it hard to<br/>\n&gt; homeschool, you do what you can and have to in order to live your<br/>\n&gt; life and homeschool the way you can. If I had to be &#39;registered&#39;<br/>\n&gt; under a private or charter school to keep my child home and teach her<br/>\n&gt; myself, I would.

Charters<br/>\n&gt; were NOT<br/>\n&gt; &gt; invented in CA so people could homeschool.  They were originally<br/>\n&gt; invented so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that alternative schools could be set up where the parents would<br/>\n&gt; control<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what was happening.  They then progressed to including various<br/>\n&gt; forms of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; homeschooling.  However, they are part of the public school system,<br/>\n&gt; and they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have basic requirements that must be met including enrollment,<br/>\n&gt; signed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; agreements, vaccinations and approved curriculum.  If they aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; meeting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them, then the legislature will finish what they started two years<br/>\n&gt; ago and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shut them all down.

I&#39;ve always been curious about them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I may regret this, but I&#39;ve worked for and enrolled my child in a<br/>\nCalifornia charter school for a couple of years now, and I feel wrong<br/>\nsaying nothing. I don&#39;t work for Horizon, but I have friends who do. They<br/>\nare probably one of the most unschooling-friendly in the bay area - they<br/>\nactually do inservices for their ES&#39;s on different methods of<br/>\nhomeschooling, including unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the &quot;requirements&quot; sound restrictive, but if you read them more<br/>\ncarefully, with a sort of creative eye, they&#39;re not too bad, and they&#39;re<br/>\nvague enough to be pretty workable. For example, &quot;achieve at least as<br/>\nmuch learning as would be required in the regular schools in California&quot;<br/>\nis pretty vague, and clearly the criteria is equivalent, not identical.<br/>\nConsidering how little is actually learned in the public schools, I don&#39;t<br/>\nsee this as even being a question. I&#39;m not sure how Horizon  works the<br/>\nstudent standards part, but I&#39;ve had no trouble finding a state standard<br/>\nthat matches almost anything a kid is doing. Sorting pokemon cards meets<br/>\na standard. Eating at an Indian restaurant meets a standard. Reading<br/>\narchie comics for months on end meets a standard... there is no<br/>\nrequirement that &quot;First grade standards&quot; must be learned in first grade,<br/>\nnot yet anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as testing, no child in California, whether enrolled in a public<br/>\nor private school, is required to take any standardized test. Yes, the<br/>\nschool is required to give it, but no one needs to come.... as far as<br/>\nvaccinations, the requirements are the same for students in a charter<br/>\nschool or those filing an R-4 (the private school homeschooling option).<br/>\nYou are legally required to have an immunization record or exemption form<br/>\nfor each child. <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of it seems to come down to the &quot;education specialist&quot; you&#39;re<br/>\nworking with. Some will require &quot;schooly&quot; things... my take on it was<br/>\nthat I wanted people to just do what they were doing anyway, and I would<br/>\nturn it into acceptable paperwork. Things were a lot easier before the<br/>\nJan. 1, 2000 law change... but even now it works for most kids that I<br/>\nhave worked with. It *is* work - you have to be willing to sit down and<br/>\nthink about (or take notes on) things that are happening through the<br/>\nmonth, and most charters require that your kids give up some &quot;work<br/>\nsamples&quot; -  ours are generally photos, score sheets from games, and<br/>\nlittle bits of paper with stuff like &quot;When will you be off the fone?!?!!&quot;<br/>\nwritten on them. Even though I work for the charter, my daughter doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to be enrolled, but she has wanted to do so because of the extra<br/>\n$1100 a year she gets through them, for tie dye kits and sculpey and<br/>\nworms and any book her little heart desires... <br/>\n<br/>\nWith that said, I&#39;m pretty sure that even with my talent at<br/>\neducationalese, a lot of my paperwork is probably not what the state has<br/>\nin mind. It has passed a couple of audits, but mostly the audits were to<br/>\nmake sure the dates matched and the forms were all signed in the right<br/>\nplaces. OTOH, I do think it&#39;s pretty cool to imagine the bigwigs at the<br/>\nstate reading about Calvin and Hobbes in language arts, and Monty Python<br/>\nvideos in Social Studies, and stringing necklaces in Math, and riding<br/>\nroller coasters and skateboarding in Science. I have only just managed to<br/>\nrestrain myself from turning in work sample mad libs that say things like<br/>\n&quot;One day a butthead man was walking down the weewee.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if it all ends tomorrow I&#39;m okay with that, it really is honestly<br/>\nall about the money.

Randy could care less whether anyone<br/>\nsucceeds or fails as long as the money keeps rolling in.  Charters were NOT<br/>\ninvented in CA so people could homeschool.

They then progressed to including various forms of<br/>\nhomeschooling.  However, they are part of the public school system, and they<br/>\nhave basic requirements that must be met including enrollment, signed<br/>\nagreements, vaccinations and approved curriculum.  If they aren&#39;t meeting<br/>\nthem, then the legislature will finish what they started two years ago and<br/>\nshut them all down.  Horizon is one of the ones under investigation for<br/>\nmisappropriate of funds.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be part of Horizon, you must sign an agreement, turn in roll sheets and<br/>\nlearning records every 20 school days.  You must meet with an ES every 20<br/>\nschool days or more frequently if needed/desired.  &quot;All students in charter<br/>\nschools are required to achieve at least as much learning as would be<br/>\nrequired in the regular schools in California.&quot;  &quot;The learning records must<br/>\nbe sent to the Lincoln office electronically within seven (7) rotations of<br/>\nthe earth after the learning period of no more than 20 school days.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Included on the learning record format is a listing of the student<br/>\nstandards in each growth area.&quot;  &quot;The ES evaluates the learning by<br/>\nindicating the student standards in which progress has occurred during the<br/>\nlearning period.&quot;  &quot;Learning records must be written to reflect the<br/>\nrequirements of independent study law.&quot;  &quot;Learning records will include<br/>\ndescriptions of the major objectives and activities of the course of study<br/>\ncovered by the agreement that were used within each assignment period.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;This Charter School must administer any state mandated test whenever one is<br/>\nprovided.

In the meantime, given the seriousness of<br/>\nthe allegations against her, it is understandable that she could not easily<br/>\nfind work.<br/>\n<br/>\n***She could have found work, just not work as an MD.  The insurance<br/>\nindustry is always looking for doctors and other medical personnel to review<br/>\nclaims.  Large malpractice firms are always looking for folks to review<br/>\ncases.  She could have done insurance exams (you don&#39;t have to be licensed<br/>\nto do those).

I don&#39;t know some<br/>\nof these details any more than others do, but I do know some comments are<br/>\nunfair when the details simply are not known.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Well, I did some research.  They didn&#39;t buy curriculum because the<br/>\nCalifornia public school system provided it for them, not a church..  The<br/>\nreason I know is I went straight to the horse&#39;s mouth, I asked Cindi<br/>\nHamilton.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;snip&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***The comments about the loss of a medical license are fine as far as facts<br/>\ngo but the implication that there was a &quot;witch hunt&quot; are out in left field.<br/>\nAlso, the way this is lumped together gives the impression that there was<br/>\none big conspiracy when the bottom line was that the good doc screwed up and<br/>\na child died.  I think the sympathy is misplaced.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll hospitals in the U.S. that receive any federal funds have to be<br/>\ncertified by the JCHA (feds)  and must meet certain criteria. That criteria<br/>\nincludes having a QA committee. Sometimes this comes under Risk Management,<br/>\nsometimes it is called Quality Management, sometimes Quality Assurance.<br/>\nEach month the hospital&#39;s QA committee meets. This committee generally<br/>\nconsists of the Chief of Staff, Risk Management, Unit Nurse Managers and<br/>\ndoctors from each discipline.<br/>\n<br/>\nALL deaths are reviewed (it doesn&#39;t take an unhappy parent to trigger this),<br/>\nall med errors are reviewed, all complaints against staff (doctors, nurses,<br/>\npharmacy, etc.) are reviewed. A person such as the head of Medical Records<br/>\nor the Nursing Services Coordinator (moi &lt;g&gt;) pulls all the records, does a<br/>\nsummary sheet--MR (medical records) No. 123456789, admitted 01/01/??,<br/>\ndiagnosis: [example] cardio-vascular insufficiency (with appropriate code<br/>\nnumber), and then the reason for the record being part of the<br/>\nreview--deceased, med error, patient/family complaint--and places the charts<br/>\non a chart and then hauls the whole works to the committee meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight off the top there would have been a problem with this record if there<br/>\nwas no dictation and it would have been noted on the summary. If the<br/>\ndictation was done but had not been transcribed, there would have been a<br/>\nflag saying: &quot;Dictated, not transcribed.&quot; These are placed in all charts as<br/>\nsoon as the transcription pool receives the dictation tapes. In hospitals<br/>\nthat have the equivalent of a voice mail system for dictation, their system<br/>\nwould be somewhat different.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, on to the basis for the disciplinary action. Not only is it<br/>\nunprofessional behavior to not physically see and exam a patient, it can be<br/>\ncriminally prosecuted. Again, this was no &quot;witch hunt,&quot; this was standard<br/>\noperating procedure for all hospitals.<br/>\n<br/>\nRed flags would have gone off all over the place when it was noted that the<br/>\ndoctor ordered tests on a patient who was not examined. Particularly when<br/>\nyou only have an approximate 48-72 hours window between life and death with<br/>\na patient who already (per your post) was diagnosed as having<br/>\nintussusception. If this is the case, it is generally considered that the<br/>\nbarium enema would not have been the appropriate test to order anyway as the<br/>\ndiagnosis had already been made. The appropriate tests would have been a CAT<br/>\nscan or ultrasound to see if there was now an obstruction or tumor.<br/>\nIntussusception can be (please note, I said &quot;can be&quot; not &quot;is&quot;) caused by<br/>\nvarious types of tumors or lymphosarcomas. The first line is to use the<br/>\nleast invasive test possible on a small child.  You did note that another<br/>\nphysician did order a CT and that it did show a brain tumor.  You don&#39;t<br/>\nmention whether or not this was a mets to the brain or a primary site.<br/>\nObviously the second doctor was a better diagnostician.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, there is no way in h*ll a doctor should treat any patient without a<br/>\nphysical exam. This is unethical AND unprofessional behavior in any hospital<br/>\nregardless of claims of &quot;not getting along with the staff.&quot;  What in the<br/>\nworld does that whining have to do with the primary charge.  Looks like a<br/>\nsmoke screen to try and spread the blame around.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a death is found to result from misconduct, the hospital is required<br/>\n(this is not an option) to turn over their findings to the California<br/>\nMedical Board who then reviews the hospital&#39;s actions.  In this case, with<br/>\nher lack of remorse and failure to accept responsibility, she is lucky that<br/>\nthey didn&#39;t turn it over to the county DA&#39;s office for criminal prosecution.<br/>\nWhich, btw, is a quite frequently the first option listed in most hospital P<br/>\n& Ps.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally the sanctions placed on doctors include being proctored, time<br/>\nlimits on dictation and some sort of leave without pay.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;snip&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That much is clear - the rest is part fact, part speculation on my part,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>part poor judgement on the CJH&#39;s part, and part covering one&#39;s behind on the<br/>\nhospital&#39;s part, part taking warranted action on the hospital&#39;s part.<br/>\n<br/>\n***The above addresses some of this but the I don&#39;t think chalking up a<br/>\nchild&#39;s death to &quot;poor judgement&quot; is something that the good doc gets to<br/>\nuse.  It is called criminal negligence.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the hospital doing a CYA, nope, if they were, they would have covered<br/>\nup for the doc as she wasn&#39;t simply someone who had privileges at the<br/>\nhospital, she was a hospital employee.  Thus, by acknowledging that she was<br/>\nnegligent, they acknowledged some responsibility for her acts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;snip&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> Part of the criticism with the care given by CJH focused on the lack of<br/>\nphysical reassessment on her part (she took the call/page from the nurses<br/>\nand ordered the enema, but did not reassess in person). The hospital appears<br/>\nto have dug further into CJH&#39;s practices to discover that on more than<br/>\nseveral occasions, the dr.&#39;s notes were dictated up to a month after the<br/>\ncare was rendered, and so the &quot;witch-hunt&quot; began in full force.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Again, this was not a &quot;witch hunt,&quot; it was federally and state mandated<br/>\nSOP.   When negligence is found, the records on all patients seen by the<br/>\nphysician being investigated are pulled for review.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The hosptial faults her for the late medical dicatations, but CJH claims<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this was a common practice at the hospital by many doctors.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Sounds like a typical teens on a sitcom excuse, &quot;But Mom, everyone else<br/>\nis doing it&quot; to which mom replies, &quot;Well, if everyone else is jumping off<br/>\nthe Golden Gate Bridge, are you going to do it too?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;There is a Business and Professions Code section 2234 and 4402 which define<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a dangerous drug but does not proscribe any conduct.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I checked my old copy of the California Business and Professions Code and<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t find these, so decided to go online and see if they had been added<br/>\nsince I last renewed my copies. The medical stuff falls under Division 2.<br/>\nHealing Arts. In Chapter 5. Medicine, Article 13. Medical Adjudication,<br/>\nthere is no Article 2234. There is an Article 2232 and 2235 but no 2234.<br/>\nChapter 9. Pharmacy, Article 23.

She refused to return to<br/>\nwork and take her punishment.  She could have applied for a transfer to<br/>\nanother facility within the group the hospital she was employed by was a<br/>\nmember.  This is done all the time and that is accepted by the Board.

At the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-518499919\">I read with great interest the comments in response to the news of the &quot;homeless homeschooled&quot; young man who achieved perfect scores on his SAT exams.  At the time, I was eager to play the Devil&#39;s advocate.  I decided not to discuss the issue entirely on hypotheticals, and so I collected additional info.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a copy and postage fee of $5.50, I obtained from the California Medical Board a copy of the action against Dr. Hamilton.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I get into any details at all, I want to address the money/computer issue.  Many complained of her three computers and her supposed inability to get a job.  The action against her began in 1996 and was finalized with the revocation of her license in Oct 2000 (the license expired in May 1999, the decision came down in Oct 2000, but the acts that were disciplined were committed prior to the license expiring).  In the meantime, given the seriousness of the allegations against her, it is understandable that she could not easily find work.  Concerning the expense of the computers, just this week, I was given two separate sources for computers given free for educational purposes, and yes, homeschoolers are eligible.  I also have three thrift stores a couple miles from my home that sell many computers and printers and faxes and monitors, etc.  I happen to live in a suburban area.  The immediate area is a mix of low income, middle class and the very wealthy, so perhaps this opportunity for used computers also exists in other suburban areas.  Also concerning money, someone mentioned the cost of housing in Calif - but did you notice, the doc has three children and they live in a ONE bedroom APT?  We all have different priorities, and it seems education is a priority in this family.  The articles I read stated that the kids did most of their schooling on-line.  Perhaps they also economize this way by not buying curriculum, but by utilizing the plethora of free educational items available through that venue.  (Told you I wanted to play the Devil&#39;s advocate).  I don&#39;t know some of these details any more than others do, but I do know some comments are unfair when the details simply are not known.  One thing I do know is the church that is referenced in the article.  The article mentions that they have been members of that particular church for only the past few years.  It&#39;s quite possible that this family has a support system in the church members.  Particularly if the M.D. has had a change of heart/life since her professional debacle befell her.  It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if members of the church donated their own used computers.  It also wouldn&#39;t surprise me if some of the kids were talented enough to build their own machines.  At any rate,  here&#39;s the professional info:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt appears that in 1989 a child was admitted to the hospital where Dr. Hamilton worked, and the patient (pt) was assigned to Dr. Hamilton (CJH).  The pt was a 10 month old infant with intussusception (telescoping of one bowel segment to another), which is serious and potentially fatal.  The infant was admitted and treated, but had symptoms later which prompted the doctor to order a barium enema.  The pt&#39;s conditioned worsened and she was sent to intensive care, where the neurological symptoms were evaluated by other dr.&#39;s who ordered a CAT scan.  As it turned out, the infant had a brain tumor and she passed away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat much is clear - the rest is part fact, part speculation on my part, part poor judgement on the CJH&#39;s part, and part covering one&#39;s behind on the hospital&#39;s part, part taking warranted action on the hospital&#39;s part.  In that the child passed away, it appears that the ensuing investigation and review was inevitable, and that the investigation uncovered practices which the hospital chose to pursue as allegation of professional misconduct (this probably helped them look better in the wake of the death:  oh, yeah, this doctor is to blame, she&#39;s a bad cat).  In that an infant died on the hospital&#39;s watch, the parents were undoubtedly overwhelmed with grief and wanted to know what happened, and who was responsible.  Part of the criticism with the care given by CJH focused on the lack of physical reassessment on her part (she took the call/page from the nurses and ordered the enema, but did not reassess in person).  The hospital appears to have dug further into CJH&#39;s practices to discover that on more than several occassions, the dr.&#39;s notes were dictated up to a month after the care was rendered, and so the &quot;witch-hunt&quot; began in full force.  The hosptial faults her for the late medical dicatations, but CJH claims this was a common practice at the hospital by many doctors.  There was speculation that (in an effort to cover up for care that was never given, some late dictation was done intentionally when no follow-up care had actually been given.  The Board admitted there is no way they could ever know for sure, and those charges were dismissed.  The doctor was also discovered to have self-medicated &quot;dangerous&quot; drugs - no, not pain killers, but acne drugs and antibiotics.  The Board dismissed these charges because there is actually no law or regulation against self-prescribing.  There is a Business and Professions Code section 2234 and 4402 which  define a dangerous drug but does not proscribe any conduct.  The section that pertains to self-administration of drugs is a different section, and that section is not alleged in the charges, and it does not per se prohibit self-administration of drugs.  Naturally, there was no action taken on the drug charges.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent many years in the U.S. Marine Corps, and I have seen my share of witch hunts.  I worked in the legal arena, although I am not a lawyer.  I have seen commander&#39;s eager to find a scape goat when they know heads will begin to roll, and I have seen how quickly one can locate an easy taget who is made to carry the load of of punishment for many.  Usually, such an individuals behavior would escape detection or not be considered punishible, were in not for some other situation looming large.  I do not make any excuses for the doctor, and I do not assume to know exactly what did happen or what should have happened.  But I do recognize that many of the elements of this investigation and the ensuing charges bear a close resemblence to other scenarios I have seen played out elsewhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we know for sure is that a child died on this doctor&#39;s watch, and finding work again has been difficult.  The doctor and hospital acknowledge personality conflicts between the staff and doctor, and the doctor claims this is part of the basis for the total action against her.  The doctor was suspended a week after the child passed away.  All of the allegations against her consituted the basis for the suspension, although many of the allegations were dismissed, for the reasons cited above.  The doctor was eligible for a probation, vice a license revocation (but keep in mind, by this time the license had expired expired).  But the reasons cited for not considering probation are: the doctor did not, in their opinion, accept responsibility for her actions (by claiming some things were common practice by others), she did not appear before the board on the day of the hearing, and the doctor&#39;s &quot;apparent unwilliingness to return to employment at VCH under rather lenient terms and conditions.&quot;  I don&#39;t know what the lenient terms and conditions were, just that the doctor described personality problems and the investigation/charges were coming out of this same hospital, and she did not want to go back.  In addition to the revocation the doctor is liable for the cost of the investigation and enforcement ($19,542.22).  She cannot have her license re-issued, renewed, or reinstated unless this cost is paid.  Of course she can apply in other states, as I understand it, and quite often other states do not check for revocation information.  If a Dr. wishes to, they can lie on an application and hope the employer does not verify.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22338,"nextTopicId":22314}}
