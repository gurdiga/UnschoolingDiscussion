These include impaired vision and hearing, limb<br/>\ndefects, mental retardation, and heart malformations... <br/>\nRubella is a harmless disease in childhood, and it confers natural<br/>\nimmunity to those who contract it so they are ulikely to experience a<br/>\nrecurrence as adults. Today, because rubella vaccinations are routinely<br/>\ngiven to children, most women never acquire natural immunity. If their<br/>\nvaccine-induced immunity wears off, the threat of contracting rubella<br/>\nduring their childbearing years should actually increase... <br/>\nIn two separate scientific studies, the new rubella vaccine introduced<br/>\nin 1979 was found to be the cause of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (also<br/>\nknown as the Epstein-Barr Virus, or the &quot;Yuppie&quot; disease), an<br/>\nimmunological disorder first reported in the U.S. in 1982.

Therefore, I went home<br/>\nthinking I wasn&#39;t pregnant, but I was feeling aweful and I was dealing<br/>\nwith horrible morning sickness. I re-visited the clinic for testing and<br/>\nonce again the test came back negative. It was then suggested instead of<br/>\ndoing a urine test that I had a blood test done. The blood test came<br/>\nback postive and I began to search for a OBGYN. <br/>\nï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Once found, I went regularly to my visits,<br/>\nas I felt so badly all of the time. Like stated above I constantly ran<br/>\nlow- grade fevers, I had a nasty sinus infection, sore throat, etc. It<br/>\nwas funny that the doctor could never come up with an official due date<br/>\nfor me either, it kept changing and he gave me no answers for my fevers.<br/>\nAll I remember from that pregnancy is how miserable I was and why I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t get rid of the fevers or the sinus difficultly. <br/>\nï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½When Becca was born it was very<br/>\ndifficult and I won&#39;t go into that whole experience here, except to say<br/>\nthat right away we knew that there was a problem and there was a lot to<br/>\ndeal with. Eventually, Rebecca was diagnosed with Noonan Syndrome. So<br/>\nhere I am dealing with all this and I&#39;m totally wiped out, tired all of<br/>\nthe time! I kept going back to the doctor trying to find out what was<br/>\nwrong with me to no avail. I had a bunch of tests done, but the only<br/>\nthing that they found was I had had the Epstein-Barr Virus and that I<br/>\njust must have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. At the time, I just had to<br/>\nlearn to deal with it and eventually over the years I changed my diet,<br/>\netc. to help me to overcome all the physical problems that I was<br/>\nexperiencing. <br/>\nï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Needless to say, when I was reading this<br/>\nsection on Rubella in Neil Millers book, all the symptoms sounded like<br/>\nme and what I went through during that time in my life. I wonder now if<br/>\nI didn&#39;t have rubella.
