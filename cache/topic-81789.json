Do you have any other options, even if inconvenient?<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\n#############################<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an eclectic, secular group in Kansas City, and over the past few <br/>\nmonths we have discovered three other unschooling families, and one almost <br/>\nunschooling family all with in an hours drive or so. Not convenient for just getting <br/>\ntogether to play any old time, but enough that if we all plan, we can get <br/>\ntogether every few weeks or so. Not enough for my kids taste, but better than <br/>\nbefore. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my point is that there is a difference between people who homeschool, <br/>\nChristian or not, and Christian Homeschoolers. The families I know that are <br/>\nChristian and homeschoolers are vastly different from the families who are <br/>\nhomeschoolers because they are Christian. It is very much an us/them ideology. <br/>\nThey (Christian Homeschoolers) believe that they started the movement. I won&#39;t <br/>\nargue the semantics of who started what when and why with them. Both camps <br/>\nevolved around the same time. Honestly though the people who started the Christian <br/>\nHomeschooling Movement wouldn&#39;t be where they are today without those who came <br/>\nbefore us. They won&#39;t admit it, but it is there. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t know about the Christian Homeschool movement, I strongly suggest <br/>\nlearning about it. If you live in the Bible Belt, and are a homeschooler, you <br/>\nlearn to deal with it. If you live in a more progressive, less conservative <br/>\narea of the country and aren&#39;t exposed to the Christian Homeschoolers ways, <br/>\nthen hearing about it is shocking. <br/>\n<br/>\nI see the jumper-wearing, long hair, meek minded female child/wife around <br/>\nhere all the time. I know several families that have chaperones for their <br/>\nfemales. If Dad can&#39;t do it, then an older son or a brother of Mom or Dad will <br/>\naccompany the females and younger boys out to the store or other places. Darin sees <br/>\nfamilies in his store all the time like this and likes to call me during the <br/>\nday to tell me a &quot;Wife&quot; was just in. He calls them this because usually the <br/>\nfamily will be in to buy something and after a discussion, sometimes a prayer, <br/>\nthe father will say things like; &quot;Okay Wife, we will get XYZ.&quot; or &quot;Wife, write <br/>\nthe man a check.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nShocking? Yes. Out there? Yes. True? Yes. Do you need to be aware of it? A <br/>\nresounding YES. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nGenius may have its limitations, but stupidity is not thus handicapped. <br/>\nElbert Hubbard <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] History Resources?

Both kids have <br/>\nbeen clamoring to meet other homeschooled kids. The kids on our block are <br/>\neither older than Moly, or younger than Jack. Not that that is a bad thing, but <br/>\nneither have much in common with the kids in our neighborhood. I tried to explain <br/>\nthat meeting the homeschooled kids in our area wouldn&#39;t have much impact as <br/>\ntheir parents generally do school-at-home and therefore would not have the same <br/>\nfreedom to play at will as Moly and Jack do. We joined anyway, the kids were <br/>\nhappy, for about five minutes. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst we went to a picnic. Moly struck up a conversation with some girls. One <br/>\nsaid to Moly; &quot;I wish I could dress like you.&quot; That confused Moly. A little <br/>\nboy said to Jack; &quot;You can&#39;t wear Sponge Bob t-shirts.&quot; Jack wanted to know why <br/>\nand was told matter of factly that he would go straight to hell. Jack found <br/>\nthat funny, I did not. Moly asked the girl why she wanted to dress like her, <br/>\nand said she thought the dress the girl was wearing was very pretty. The girl <br/>\nsaid; &quot;You wouldn&#39;t think so if you were me.&quot; and pointed out her four sisters, <br/>\nall in the same style dress, all in the same colors. Three girls had dark blue <br/>\nstripes with smaller white stripes, and two had large white stripes with <br/>\nsmall dark blue stripes, all had either blue or white sashes. All had the same <br/>\nlong, straight hair, and all had the same shoes. Moly asked the girl why she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t just put on jeans and a t-shirt, and the girl said she only had one pair of <br/>\njeans and a blouse, and she only wore those to work in the garden or to feed <br/>\nand care for her rabbits. :o(<br/>\n<br/>\nThe discussion between Moly and this girl turned to what curriculum did <br/>\nMoly&#39;s mom use to teach her. (Moly had to have the word curriculum explained to <br/>\nher.) And the girl was horrified to hear that Moly&#39;s mom used no such thing. I <br/>\nthink she was more shocked that public schooled kids are when they hear that. I <br/>\nthink public schooled kids, as institutionalized as they are, can at least <br/>\naccept that there are some parents in the world who do what they dream of. Then <br/>\nthe girl wanted to know how Moly (if her mom didn&#39;t use a curriculum) learned <br/>\nabout how God wants her to live her life. Moly just shrugged her shoulders and <br/>\nsaid that God wants her to be happy no matter what she does. <br/>\n<br/>\nMoly didn&#39;t understand the intricacies of the conversation and how to read <br/>\nbetween the lines of what the girl was saying to her. OTOH, the girl couldn&#39;t <br/>\ngrasp what Moly was saying either. She had no concept of freedom or even wanting <br/>\nto do something and actually doing it. No free thinking. No rights. Ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward to a parent meeting. Guest speakers giving a talk on how to keep <br/>\nthe &quot;Marriage Spark Alive&quot; As a couple or marriage must come first, we have <br/>\nto provide a strong front to the kids. All this talk of child centered lives is <br/>\ndetrimental to a marriage, and to the children as well. If they don&#39;t see us <br/>\nas a united front then they will run right over us. They are children to be <br/>\ntrained up properly in the way God has prescribed to us. Discussion afterward <br/>\nand Darin stood up and said &quot;lets go, NOW!&quot; We went home. I unsubscribed from <br/>\nthe groups email lists. Two days later we got an email from one of the leaders <br/>\nstating she was sad to see we had unsubscribed, and was our intention to not <br/>\nparticipate in the group anymore, and if so how could she help. I wasn&#39;t going <br/>\nto write back, but Darin did. He wrote, &quot;We are not at war with our children.&quot; <br/>\nI think that answered their questions. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nGenius may have its limitations, but stupidity is not thus handicapped. <br/>\nElbert Hubbard <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80380,"nextTopicId":81723}}
