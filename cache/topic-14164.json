My 3 didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant them to leave.  Now all they&#39;ve been talking about is &quot;when can we go<br/>\nto Maine & see Sam, Frank & Henry&quot;.  Now I&#39;m excited & looking at taking a<br/>\ntrip with just the kids myself.  Not as long as Alice.  I don&#39;t think my<br/>\nhusband would take us being gone for 2 months very well.  But we&#39;re looking<br/>\nat some areas close to & in Fla.<br/>\n<br/>\nA really great idea they did was take Polaroid pics every day of something<br/>\nto remind them of that day.  Alice made a notebook with protective sleaves<br/>\ncontaining notebook paper to capture the day, where they were, who they<br/>\nspent their day with & what they did.  It was so fascinating to thumb<br/>\nthrough.  She plans to have the boys expanding it with more information when<br/>\nthey return home.  It was a great memory book.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the best thing about their trip was what the boys spoke of as their<br/>\nfavorite experience.  Disney, Epcot & MGM were not even on the list.  They<br/>\ntalked about the Grand Canyon, the Pacific coastline, the redwood forests &<br/>\nthe people they met.  They made lots of new friends from Friends, friends of<br/>\nfriends & homeschool families, as well as all the family they were able to<br/>\nreunit with on the trip.  The boys never even mentioned Disney.  My point is<br/>\nthe tourist stops & all their expenses were not even a highlight for the<br/>\nkids, though Alice said they had a great time when they were there.  It&#39;s<br/>\nnice to see kids enjoy the &quot;real America&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother-in-law will die when she hears of my plans for a trip alone with<br/>\nthe kids.  She couldn&#39;t believe anyone would attempt it.  So I&#39;ll have the<br/>\nEMTs on standby when I get my plans lined up.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"31vA1tgWvuPSbKn_PTZJsGIxe9mhgNHef_4subKPrsOg94uVuDrWDR5FPxOVhGtTUBH0aqKpXbtv","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] HOW TO TALK SO KIDS WILL LISTEN","postDate":"974384436","msgId":14165,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc1LmMzODdiOGQuMjc0NTQ3MzRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14164,"nextInTopic":14174,"prevInTime":14164,"nextInTime":14166,"topicId":14164,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"_Whole Child, Whole Parent_ and _The Continuum Concept_  both changed me and reinforced some of the odd beliefs I had picked up.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1928716190\">_Whole Child, Whole Parent_ and _The Continuum Concept_  both changed me and <br/>\nreinforced some of the odd beliefs I had picked up.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Kerry","from":"&quot;Kerry &quot; &lt;kkibort@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"uJcS1SW13aj1jDhjELVm0ka9iX9Ay2AwZExUcC7neo1UZkNw6tU2BIcaPotd3elzhBfndTmLSL7AuqQ4cQCL9d0vng","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"HOW TO TALK SO KIDS WILL LISTEN","postDate":"974381036","msgId":14164,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDh2MG41YytvYTFsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14165,"prevInTime":14163,"nextInTime":14165,"topicId":14164,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello all!

I started reading it last night, and <br/>\nit brought me to tears. All the things I learned from my parents I <br/>\nhad been passing on to my kids without realizing it. I was being so <br/>\nhurtful! I feel like I could&#39;ve written that book, IF I had managed <br/>\nto see the light BEFORE I read it. <br/>\nWe are new to homeschooling, newer to unschooling. My husband and I <br/>\nare making major changes in our parenting and this book is our <br/>\nnew &quot;bible&quot;. If there is anyone who hasn&#39;t yet read this book- READ <br/>\nIT! Its so simple and yet makes so much sense to me! <br/>\nFor the &quot;experts&quot;- Are there any other books you&#39;r reccommend to a <br/>\nfriend just starting this adventure? I have read so much, and I keep <br/>\nfinding books that really speak to me. I&#39;d love some suggestions.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKerry<br/>\nPS. I also started &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; this week- CAN YOU SAY <br/>\nFABULOUS?!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14173,"nextTopicId":14177}}
