I am <br/>\nMs. Busybody and love getting out to chat with other Moms, shop, etc. <br/>\nAlmost *every* morning we go out, there is a struggle because my son <br/>\n*never* wants to go anywhere. (Well, occasionally he wants to go if it&#39;s <br/>\nsomewhere we&#39;ve been before and he&#39;s really excited about it, like a local <br/>\nindoor play place he loves.) I always figured he was just &quot;in the zone&quot; of <br/>\nplaying in the house and once we got to our destination he&#39;d be happy. I <br/>\nguess I need to start understanding that he may really prefer to stay home...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.&quot;<br/>\n-- William Butler Yeats<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon Entin<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:entinfamily@...\">entinfamily@...</a><br/>\nwww.ShannonEntin.com and www.TheEntins.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98912,"nextTopicId":98927}}
