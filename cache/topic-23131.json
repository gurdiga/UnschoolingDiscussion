In 1982 when I was expecting boy <br/>\n#1 my dh was just sure we were going to circumcise.  We were delivering at a <br/>\nfree-standing birthing center with a certified nurse-midwife and at some <br/>\npoint during our visits she started talking to us about those after birth <br/>\ndecisions, including circumcision.    We read the material she gave out and <br/>\nI just turned to Gary and said &quot;No Way!&quot;  There are wayyyyy too many risks <br/>\ninvolved and that&#39;s that!  He actually agreed and there was no turning back.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth our boys were taught how to care for themselves and are now 18 and 14 <br/>\nand have never had a single problem.  I must share a little story about when <br/>\nmy 14 yo was born in 1987.  Because of a horrible insurance situation he was <br/>\nborn in a hospital but with a midwife in attendance.  Apparently when they <br/>\ntook him down to the nursery to weigh him (with dh in close attendance) <br/>\nthere was a little boy in there laying in the cribette on a papoose board <br/>\njust crying his little heart out. No one was around.  The nurses were <br/>\notherwise occupied, his mother must have still been in her hospital room and <br/>\nhe had no one to hold him, caress him or let him know he was loved...  this <br/>\nwas the way he was treated AFTER his circ.  My dh told me all about this <br/>\nlittle fellow with tears in his eyes.  It certainly cemented our decision <br/>\nand confirmed for him that it was the right decision to make!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as vaccinations go, we started off that way when dd was born in 1980, <br/>\nbut after a couple of very bad reactions and a recommendation by a skin dr <br/>\nto call it quits, we did.  Now at 21 she&#39;s a little miffed at me because she <br/>\njust joined the US Army and has to spend this first week at basic training <br/>\ngetting brought up to date on all those shots, but I don&#39;t regret it for a <br/>\nminute.  At the time I was saving her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, that&#39;s all for me for now!<br/>\n<br/>\nJeanmarie - mother to 14yo who&#39;s slowly moving into our 2nd year of doing <br/>\nthis and loving every minute of it!<br/>\nAIM: Jmarie2qlt<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23556,"nextTopicId":23570}}
