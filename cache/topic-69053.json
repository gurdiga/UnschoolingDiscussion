My 14 year old d still loves to play a variety of things but is also experimenting with clothes,makeup etc.. I have had people use different words of she is very mature to immature, innocent, down to earth, etc.. I think it comes down to just being who she is at that moment. Right now she is experiencing emotions in a more intense way. Lots of restlessness,tears etcc. I wondered aloud to her about whether sheneeded more social as she has always had a very small need for lots of friend. She thought a long time about it and came back to say she thought what she was missing right now was she needed to play more with things like playmobile and dollhouses,things like that.A very different way of knowing herself than I ever experienced.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaureen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, May 14, 2003 8:50 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] maturity, real and imagined (was smoking)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 5/14/03 8:17:39 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummy124@...\">mummy124@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; Could very well be.
