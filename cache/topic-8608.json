I found out that the daughter of <br/>\na woman on another list I belong to just died after fighting a hard cancer <br/>\nbattle since the beginning of the year.  She was only eight years old.  This <br/>\nhit me pretty hard because I am coming up on three years since the diagnosis <br/>\nof my own breast cancer.  I sat in the computer room, staring out the window, <br/>\nwondering why I am still here when this precious soul, who barely had a <br/>\nchance to taste life, is gone.<br/>\n<br/>\n   As I sat by the window thinking, and admiring what promises to be a <br/>\nbeautiful spring day, I noticed kids gathering at the bus stop.  I started <br/>\nthinking how different my morning would be if I had to get my son off to <br/>\nschool.  I went back upstairs to snuggle with Colton, who had migrated from <br/>\nhis bed to mine.  We were joined by our troublemaker Boo Cat, and my sweet <br/>\nAnya, the happiest dog in the world.  My son and I played with the animals <br/>\nand talked about everything and nothing for a solid half hour.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Colton was able to linger over a breakfast of strawberry toast and a <br/>\nblackberry shake while I read to him from one of the books in the Redwall <br/>\nseries.  Our plans for the rest of the day will probably include pouring over <br/>\nthe new dinosaur books we picked up at the library yesterday, playing some <br/>\nmath games, a LOT more reading, and a long bike ride.  What luxury!  What a <br/>\ngift!<br/>\n<br/>\n   Cancer taught me a valuable lesson.  I learned to live my life with <br/>\nboundless enthusiasm, loving my family and friends with reckless abandon.  I <br/>\nlearned that so many things I used to think were important just don&#39;t matter. <br/>\n These are a few of the things that DO: Sitting with Colton for twenty <br/>\nminutes while we watch a bird take a bath in the water that drips from our <br/>\npicnic table.  Answering the phone to discover it&#39;s my husband, taking a <br/>\nmoment from his busy day to call and say he loves me.  Laughing with my <br/>\nfamily until tears run down our cheeks and our sides ache.  Taking the time <br/>\nto really listen when Colton wants to tell me more information about Pokemon. <br/>\n Taking my husband&#39;s hand when we walk together.  Telling my son I am so <br/>\nhappy to be his mom.  This is all holy ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Life is so fragile and fleeting, but at the same time it is achingly <br/>\nbeautiful.  I am grateful that I now see the world with new eyes, that I have <br/>\nfound the sacred in the mundane.  Yes, there are heartbreaks and difficult <br/>\nvalleys we must walk.  But all along the path, there are blessings that move <br/>\nme to tears.  I plan to seek them out and revel in them.  Drink deeply of <br/>\nlife, my friends, and go give someone you love a hug.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8569,"nextTopicId":8647}}
