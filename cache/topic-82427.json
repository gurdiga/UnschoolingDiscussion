They don&#39;t like to watch stuff they think is <br/>\nboring or scary, and they&#39;re all busy kids.  When they were littler lots of <br/>\nstuff was boring.  Too much talking or romance, and they had no interest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey can watch all they want.  We find that&#39;s not so much as most people <br/>\nwould guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s watching The Simpsons (waiting for it to start, rather, after the <br/>\ngame, and after the news).  Kirby and Marty are playing video games with guests.  <br/>\nKeith&#39;s probably watching the weather and will turn it off at 10:20 and go to <br/>\nsleep.  I watched half an episode of That 70&#39;s Show, with Holly, but that was <br/>\nmy personal total today.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And <br/>\ndo you have concerns about the corporate/advertising influence on your kids <br/>\n-- &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo.  They&#39;re smart and analytical.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I think I can work toward trusting him, <br/>\nknowing he will choose content that he finds compelling and therefore is not <br/>\n&quot;trash&quot; (even Power Rangers -- that&#39;s a new one for us and my ex-teacher self <br/>\nis <br/>\nsilently struggling with that), but are there any pitfalls with that attitude <br/>\nthat I need to be aware of? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pitfall is the possibility of your thinking that you&#39;ll know what&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;trash,&quot; or thinking there are &quot;trash&quot; things from which your child would learn <br/>\nnothing at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and Marty both sometimes watch a kind of odious late-night game show <br/>\ncalled Street Smarts.  I told them I thought it was awful, that they are betting <br/>\non who will be more stupid.  They both fell over the other explaining to me <br/>\nwhat was cool about it, and they were right!  Everything they said made sense.  <br/>\nI got it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey both sometimes watch Jerry Springer.  It embarrasses me because I have <br/>\nmany poor southern relatives and I hate to think of the similarities.  But <br/>\nthat&#39;s my personal problem. &lt;g&gt;   They see it in several different ways, and have <br/>\ndiscussed why people would be the way they are.  They don&#39;t think those people <br/>\nare typical or sensible.  We&#39;ve talked about how lacking some people are in <br/>\nthe most basic of social skills and awarenesses, and what might help them be <br/>\nbetter and that show is one of the most fascinating labs for what lack of <br/>\ninterpersonal intelligence can lead to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t personally like courtroom shows, but years ago, when I was a kid, I <br/>\nreally did.<br/>\nWhen I was little I remember watching Queen for a Day.
