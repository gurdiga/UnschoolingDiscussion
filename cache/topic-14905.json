I<br/>\nloved school, was really good at school even when I was at my highest point<br/>\nof misbehaving (which was pretty high ;-)  I also have LOTS of memories of<br/>\nmy favorite game as a child being school.  I loved to sit my teddy bears &<br/>\nbabydolls down & teach them!  For as long as I can remember I&#39;ve wanted to<br/>\nbe a teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I earned my degree & certification I had trouble finding a position.  I<br/>\nwas offered positions in faraway tiny towns which I didn&#39;t want.  I was<br/>\noffered positions in private Christian schools which is not right for me<br/>\neither.  I frankly became quite bitter that I could not find a position<br/>\nright for me because of the political nature of the school system.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my oldest child was born I remembered that my grandmother always said<br/>\nthat there&#39;s a reason for everything, but that sometimes it takes a while to<br/>\ndiscover them.  I first read about homeschooling when my eldest was 2 weeks<br/>\nold & it was like a lightbulb in my head....so this is why I&#39;ve always<br/>\nwanted to teach!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it would help if you examine why you wanted to teach and what you love<br/>\nabout it.  Unfortunately I can&#39;t help you with your family as I&#39;ve always<br/>\nbeen the one in my family that does things differently, so it&#39;s easy as<br/>\nthey&#39;ve come to expect it!  I would also suggest that once you&#39;ve made a<br/>\ndecision that&#39;s best for you and your children, then it&#39;s easier to defend<br/>\nto others.  But don&#39;t make decisions for your parents or siblings that would<br/>\nbe potentially wrong decisions for you and your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with whatever you decide.  I think if you follow your heart you<br/>\nalready know what&#39;s best for your son.  And we&#39;ll all be here to help!<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14902,"nextTopicId":14906}}
