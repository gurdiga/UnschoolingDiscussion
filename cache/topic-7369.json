Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry all this doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with unschooling (though many <br/>\nwill argue that everything does), but the reason I&#39;m posting this on here is <br/>\nbecause I know there are many on here with chronic diseases.  I went to the <br/>\ndoctor last week with many many symptoms and he told me it was probably just <br/>\nmild fibromylgia (would hate to see severe) but ran some test anyway.  My ANA <br/>\ntiter came back a high positive.  Doctor said he was surprised, he was <br/>\nexpecting all tests to be normal.  Anyway does anyone here know what diseases <br/>\nthis might indicate.  Before the test we were concerned that it might be MS, <br/>\nbut now think it&#39;s probably lupus, there&#39;s a family history of lupus too.  My <br/>\ndoctor doesn&#39;t seem to think I fit the criteria, though my mom, who&#39;s an RN <br/>\ndoes.  Anyway, I was wondering if anyone here knew of any other diseases that <br/>\nan abnormal ANA test might indicate.  And do people with MS have abnormal ANAs?<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks in advance,<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\nNow Get Cash Just For Reading E-mail-Everyday!<br/>\nYou&#39;ll build your own refund by tax time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dollars4mail.com/ID=FBN-510\">http://www.dollars4mail.com/ID=FBN-510</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7361,"nextTopicId":7375}}
