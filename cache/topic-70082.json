My little ones (4, 3, 2...well, <br/>\nalmost 3 and almost 2) run around naked all the time.  My family thinks they <br/>\nshould be punished for it.  Makes no sense to me whatsoever.  They don&#39;t do <br/>\nit in public!  Um, well, ok, maybe Ethan did at McD&#39;s the other day but <br/>\nANYWAY &lt;bwg&gt;!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was raised to think nudity was a BAD thing.  I still don&#39;t feel <br/>\ncomfortable being naked in front of my own husband, not even by myself!  <br/>\nIt&#39;s a huge problem that I work on daily and has nothing to do with my &#39;body <br/>\nimage&#39; other than I was always told naked=bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll my kids have gone through stages of wanting to be naked.  Some much more <br/>\nthan others.  Hannah, my 4.5 yr old rarely ever gets dressed if we are <br/>\nspending the day at home.  We (the people living under this roof) don&#39;t even <br/>\nnotice it anymore.  I think most kids come to a stage where they become <br/>\n&#39;aware&#39; of the social aspect of nudity and start to want to be in clothes in <br/>\nfront of others.  Nicholette just turned 7 and she still feels comfortable <br/>\nbeing naked around me and the kids but not around my husband.  She&#39;ll run <br/>\naround after her shower without clothes on but generally it doesn&#39;t last <br/>\nvery long.  Maybe an hour or so at most.  The older they get, the less they <br/>\nwant to be naked.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then there&#39;s Hannah who may never wear clothes unless we tie her down <br/>\nand lock them on! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad my kids don&#39;t feel the way I used to.  I&#39;m glad we have given them <br/>\nan environment that doesn&#39;t stigmatize nude bodies as sexual beings only.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunky side note:  I think breastfeeding openly has helped to establish that <br/>\nenvironment as well.  They don&#39;t go &quot;OOOOO Boobies!&quot; like so many kids do.  <br/>\nJust another body part, no less amazing than the nose on their face!  I like <br/>\nthat!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;What an excellent post.  It reminded me of how &quot;sexual&quot; people make<br/>\nthings.  My now 4 yo has always run around in a diaper and then<br/>\nunderwear.  Up until he turned 4  he would pretty much take of his<br/>\nclothes and run around comfortably in his underwear.  My dh&#39;s family<br/>\nand especially the kids ranging from younger than him to grown up<br/>\nalways had to comment.  They kept trying to kncikname him something<br/>\nto do with being *naked*.  The kid wasn&#39;t *naked* and we never<br/>\nthought twice about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\">http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Am I just being naïve ?","postDate":"1053445219","msgId":70286,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVDNDU3QTY4LThBRDktMTFENy1BNEY5LTAwMEE5NTZFMTA5RUBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjE3a1VxTHBIa2F0ZDQwMDAxYTViY0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":70166,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":70285,"nextInTime":70287,"topicId":70082,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is so good, Jennifer, so TRUE.
