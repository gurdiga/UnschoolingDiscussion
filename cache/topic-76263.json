My first thought was no wonder the<br/>\ndaughter wants to go to school! The other one was when I saw the pic of the<br/>\nlittle boy printing out those letters all 10 times each.

What&#39;s on the website <br/>\nisn&#39;t what&#39;s in the paper (as to title).  <br/>\n<br/>\nLook soon if you&#39;re going to, because they only leave these things available <br/>\nfor a week and some before they&#39;re subscription only.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those more local, it&#39;s in Sage magazine (a monthy women&#39;s supplement to <br/>\nthe Journal).  There are no photos of us, because I told them it was a really <br/>\nbad week for us.  They insisted a photographer was going to spend two whole <br/>\nhalf-days just observing us homeschooling.  I said there would be nothing to see, <br/>\nit was a really bad week, but told them the places where my kids would be <br/>\n(Kirby at work, Marty&#39;s orc-ball game, Holly at the Harry Potter tournament, the <br/>\nhomeschooling get-together Holly goes to, all of those would have had <br/>\nhomeschoolers, but they only wanted a photo f ME unschooling THEM).   I&#39;m glad the <br/>\neditor got frustrated enough to say they were going to use other photos.  She was <br/>\nSURE that because they were professionals that just spending two half days at <br/>\nour house they would see things I hadn&#39;t noticed before.  And she wanted <br/>\nmornings.  After me reciting HOURS worth of photogenic stuff outside, she said <br/>\n&quot;How are your mornings?&quot;  I said &quot;The kids are asleep and I&#39;m online.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish she had run the article by some homeschoolers for polish on a couple <br/>\nof things, and I wish she would not use indirect quotes which still put exact <br/>\nwords into people&#39;s mouths, and I wish she wouldn&#39;t create quotes out of parts. <br/>\n A couple of the things I&#39;m quoted as having said don&#39;t even sound like me, <br/>\nalthough the gist of it was there.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily, some of the quotes were pulled from websites so those weren&#39;t <br/>\nscrewed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s positive, though, and pretty uplifting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy stomach fell when I saw the quote about homeschoolers spending all their <br/>\ntime telling their kids what to do, so that a break each week was really <br/>\nwelcome.
