It might be a concern - if this is a kid who stays up <br/>\nlate and then can&#39;t get moving in the morning. Maybe it is a natural <br/>\nconsequence that the kid ENJOYS - I used to love it when I was too slow <br/>\ngetting ready for school and didn&#39;t have time to walk - loved having my mom <br/>\nDRIVE me to school. It was special.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NATURAL consequence of staying up late is probably just feeling more <br/>\ntired the next day. And it might or might not be worth it - but kids will <br/>\nlearn, naturally, to consider that possibility when they&#39;re deciding when to <br/>\ngo to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we&#39;re going to go someplace really early in the morning - which we are <br/>\nTOMORROW - my kids have learned, from experiencing the natural consequence of <br/>\nbeing overtired and not enjoying their day as much as they would have with <br/>\nenough sleep, that it usually pays to try to get to sleep a lot earlier than <br/>\nusual (usual is very late). I might remind them that they have to get up <br/>\nearly, but they are just as likely to remind ME to get to bed earlier than <br/>\nusual, &quot;Remember, Mommy, we don&#39;t want you to be tired and cranky tomorrow, <br/>\nokay?&quot; &lt;G&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38460,"nextTopicId":38472}}
