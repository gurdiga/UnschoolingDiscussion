Too bad people don&#39;t make more of an effort to read the emotions <br/>\nthat go along with what a child is saying.  If it was really his mother <br/>\ndoing that, and not in just a joking way, you&#39;d think the emotions he <br/>\nshowed as he was telling about it would have been obvious.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, it can look a lot worse than it really is.  My <br/>\ngranddaughter had really awful tantrums until just a few months ago.  She&#39;s <br/>\nalmost 7 and quite strong.  There were times when my daughter had to <br/>\nphysically pin her, to keep her from doing her or the baby any serious <br/>\ndamage.  (These were screaming, hitting, biting, pinching, hair-pulling, <br/>\nthrowing things, completely out of control kinds of tantrums.)  When Skye <br/>\nwas being pinned, she would be screaming as loud as she could, &quot;You&#39;re <br/>\nhurting me.  You&#39;re hurting me.)  I witnessed one that happened in a <br/>\nparking lot, and saw people walking by obviously trying to decide whether <br/>\nto step in or call CPS or something.  It was a real worry for a while, to <br/>\nthe point where Heather actually considered having cards printed up, <br/>\nexplaining what was going on, and that the only pain Skye was feeling was <br/>\nbecause of her resisting being pinned.  And that she was only being pinned <br/>\nto avoid physical injuries to any of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThankfully, her parents found her a supplement that made a huge difference <br/>\nin her behavior, and then she recently had a native-syle healing circle <br/>\ndone for her, which seems to have made even more of a difference.  She <br/>\nstill isn&#39;t an easy child to parent, by a long shot, but the physical <br/>\nviolence and most of the screaming has stopped.  (This is a child who was <br/>\nborn at home, attachment parented,  breastfed &quot;forever&quot;, everything Heather <br/>\ncould discover that might help her to grow up feeling empowered and <br/>\nemotionally healthy.  It certainly seems to have a chemical basis, to the <br/>\npoint where Heather was close to letting the docs put her on Lithium or <br/>\nsomething.)<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nTia Leschke   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island<br/>\n********************************************************************************************<br/>\nIt is the answers which separate us, the questions which unite us. - Janice <br/>\nLevy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Kolleen","from":"Kolleen &lt;Kolleen@...&gt;","profile":"kaydeecross","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"da4OXDtAAqaPoXRwB7qumbyI9-H2gjNLanBr2KGA4EYxj8YG849VBGpMLD1ohlEie5xNdLUmFExiOl0nUUuxUw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1616","postDate":"1006726387","msgId":28488,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDExMTI1MjIxOS5mQVBNSnJBWjAwNDUzMkBueWNzbXRwMm91dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":28483,"nextInTopic":28497,"prevInTime":28487,"nextInTime":28489,"topicId":28447,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
