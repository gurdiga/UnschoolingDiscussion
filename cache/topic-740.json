I feel like I need an unschooling<br/>\nboost into the summer. I always like to have a book in progress; it<br/>\nhelps keep me motivated.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, Olivia ~<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI cannot recommend highly enough &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook ~ How<br/>\nto Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education&quot; by Grace Llewellyn.<br/>\nWhile it is geared more toward teens, it has a *wealth* of absolutely<br/>\nfantastic information for *anyone* who is unschooling. She devotes an<br/>\nentire chapter to deschooling entitled, &quot;The importance of The<br/>\nVacation.&quot; The first sentence of that chapter reads, &quot;Before you start<br/>\nyour new life, you have to let go of the old one.&quot; I&#39;m telling you, this<br/>\nbook is fantastic and talk about motivating!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tA second book I&#39;d like to mention is &quot;Deschooling our Lives&quot; edited by<br/>\nMatt Hern. I&#39;m only on page 5 so I can&#39;t actually &quot;recommend&quot; it, but I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s going to be a good read. It&#39;s actually a compilation of<br/>\nessays/articles by various people, including Grace (mentioned above),<br/>\nJohn Holt, John Taylor Gatto, and even Leo Tolstoy! Hmm....that one<br/>\nshould be interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFor that &quot;boost&quot; you&#39;re talking about, I would also suggest something<br/>\nfor *you* that doesn&#39;t necessarily involve homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>\nSomething that will encourage you and give you lots to think about. I<br/>\n*love* the books by Sarah ban Breathnach, especially &quot;Simple Abundance.&quot;<br/>\nFull of great, short essays which especially speak to women.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut my *ultimate* recommendation to you would be a great book of poetry<br/>\nand a cup of good tea! :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t(<br/>\n\t\t )<br/>\n\t\t(<br/>\n\t       ___<br/>\n               &#92;_/o<br/>\n<br/>\nDenise, a Tea Lover in South Carolina<br/>\nStop by for a cup of tea ~ <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/sc/tealover\">http://www.angelfire.com/sc/tealover</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tanya in WA","from":"&quot;Tanya in WA&quot; &lt;tbone2@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"TuVhoErGHs9-AFuy5ugYW4zRl2ikooANhPOI-Z-WQ1AzGej76aLyybNCsfoYzAmc_McWrCq2TYOLxDxcn1WVF04nmgW6uYSKjso","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Need New Reading Material","postDate":"928767524","msgId":758,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy42NC43NTguOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":757,"nextInTopic":759,"prevInTime":757,"nextInTime":759,"topicId":740,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Mary Ellen, What age group is this book geared towards?
