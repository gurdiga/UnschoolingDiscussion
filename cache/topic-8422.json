I guess it&#39;s them - <br/>\nmaybe it&#39;s me.  Everyone seems so lazy, and I&#39;m not just talking about when <br/>\nit comes to so called educational stuff.  They won&#39;t pick up after themselves <br/>\nand when I ask them to, they act like I&#39;ve asked them to cut off an arm or <br/>\nsomething.  My son argues with EVERYTHING I say, and he complains about <br/>\nalmost everything we do, even if it&#39;s something he&#39;ll end up enjoying.  And <br/>\nthe kids fight constantly.  I don&#39;t think they used to fight as much as they <br/>\ndo now.  I&#39;m not sure, but it seems like it&#39;s gotten worse since the baby was <br/>\nborn 15 months ago.   It&#39;s hard for me to ignore the constant bickering, <br/>\nbelieve me - I&#39;ve tried, and I just can&#39;t do it.  I have to say I haven&#39;t <br/>\nbeen behaving much better myself lately.  My temper has become incredibly <br/>\nshort, and I find myself yelling about the smallest of things. I don&#39;t have <br/>\nmuch time for myself, and I usually don&#39;t mind too much about that, but it&#39;s <br/>\nbeen a real source of irritation lately.  When I try to sneak off to do my <br/>\nown thing, it never fails someone finds me, and seems to take delight in <br/>\ndisrupting me.  I love my family dearly and I&#39;m commited to making <br/>\nhomeschooling work for us.  We&#39;ve only recently begun to experiment with <br/>\nunschooling...maybe that&#39;s part of the problem.  So, tell me...what am I <br/>\ndoing wrong?  I need help!  <br/>\n<br/>\nJodye</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8413,"nextTopicId":8426}}
