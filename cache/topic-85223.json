So, I guess now that she would be in kindergarten this year, I am officially (lol) unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, to add to the recent samples of days with little ones: <br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan (11 mos.) wakes up around 8:45 -- plays in the living room floor with various rattles and his rocking horse while I drink tea and read emails.  I&#39;m mostly not going to keep describing him in this -- just assume that he is playing with us and giggling  and having diaper changes and playing peekaboo and nursing for a short time about every 1/2 hour or  hour, lol.  (Nursing (all food, actually) is &quot;mum-mum&quot;  -- He signs &quot;want&quot; (hands open and closing) and says mum-mum. VERY cute).  <br/>\n<br/>\nLydia (5, almost 6) wakes up at around 11:30.  Jonathan and I go into bedroom and lie in bed with her, cuddling and talking about Scooby-Doo characters and why the Scooby-Doo computer game never had the museum director as the villian (the game changes clues from game to game -- 5 possible suspects, clues change from game to game, so that different suspects turn out to be the villian).  Talk about random event generators, coin flips, and dice. <br/>\n<br/>\n Lydia tries to guess what clue would differentiate a museum director.  I think maybe a schedule book, but Lydia thinks that the information/ticket desk suspect might have that as well and maybe even the cook.  I think a piece of letterhead that said &quot;museum director&quot; -- talked about what letterhead was and why people would want it (&quot;can&#39;t you just write your name on it?&quot; asked Lydia).  Get bored with discussion without ever coming to conclusion. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlay &quot;princess lydia characters&quot; a kind of story-game in which we sort of act-out a mystery story about princess lydia finding someone who is kidnapped, inventing clues as we go along.  This time, I am princess lydia, lydia is a flower fairy.  Scooby-Doo is kidnapped.  Story revolves on whether slimy substance left behind is &quot;zoombie slime&quot; (slippery) or &quot;bugman slime&quot; (sticky).  Flower fairy demonstrates that slime is slippery so off to zombie mansion, after other clues and battles and villians, rescue Scooby-Doo. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow around 12:30 -- decide to eat &quot;breakfast&quot; --  In the kitchen, Lydia picks up a copy of the New Yorker magazine off the table and says that she was trying to read it -- but she doesn&#39;t know what a letter was -- turns out to be a W, formed by superimposing 2 &quot;V&quot;s  -- talk about artistic changes to letters and letter forms and legibility.  She reads &quot;new yorkier&quot; -- new yorkier?  I tell her New Yorker. Talk about New York (by which she means &quot;Manhattan&quot; which she loves - based on 3 visits).  Talked about cover -- &quot;why is he sitting in a corner ?&quot;  figures of speech, painting oneself into a corner. <br/>\n<br/>\nI cook some already-made pierogies and onions (a kind of pasta dumpling filled with potatoes and cheese -- purchased from a school fundraiser for a friend).   Lydia eats canned peaches and contemplates pierogies.  (Jonathan eats canned peaches and pierogies and multi-grain cereal and breastmilk and anything that he can get his hands on).   Lydia wants to try pierogies (as long as I removed all onions) and likes  them.  Lydia eats more pierogies.  Questions how to get mashed potatoes into pierogie. Talk about how pierogies are made.<br/>\n<br/>\nI checked emails and Lydia plays something in the hallway where she has her pretend stove/sink and cabinets set up (called the &quot;Pretend Kitchen&quot; in our house). Calls out to me -- &quot; 2 + 7 = 9&quot; doesn&#39;t it?  I answer yes.  She goes back to playing whatever she is playing. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlumber arrives to fix second floor kitchen sink (We rent our 2nd and 3rd floors to grad students as separate apartments).  Watch plumber fix sink. Think about tools, decided they are fun.  Lydia decides that you need tools in order to &quot;plumb&quot;  Talk about what the verb was for &quot;plumber&quot; did not come to any conclusion - Lydia not interested in us going downstairs to look it up. (Looked it up this morning -- it is &quot;plumb&quot;).  Lydia goes around pointing out all the things that are nouns and describing them with adjectives (we&#39;ve been watching the SchoolHouse Rock DVD -- brings back many happy childhood memories for me).  We both sing the adjective song, much to the amusement of the plumber.  Come back downstairs. I nurse the baby to sleep and Lydia sits beside me complaining of boredom.  She decides she wanted to look at a website -- so we end up with an insects website, trying at her request to find some insects of which had never heard.  Look at the giraffe beatle (which I recommend - boy is it weird looking).  Discuss where &quot;Madagascar&quot; is and why we can&#39;t go there this afternoon to look for these beetles.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLydia picks up one of J&#39;s rattles and notices that it is a gear. Discuss what kind of gear (a rack and pinion) - decide to give it to Jonathan to play with next time we played with her gear book (Book has a story-line about a junkyard robot making inventions with gear pieces to put together on the page in the book (has a motor that turns the central gear). When we play with it, Lydia is the &quot;gear fairy&quot; who magically makes the pieces appear and explains to me (princess lydia) how gears work). <br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan now asleep (around 3:00?) -- Read some books (magic schoolbus, I think) to Lydia. Pop popcorn and I eat popcorn and read old copies of Mothering Magazine that a friend uncluttered to me (uncluttered for her, that is!) and Lydia watches Bear in the Big Blue House DVD and eats popcorn and grapes and 3 Hershey kisses (all we could find in the candy cupboard).  Write &quot;kisses&quot; on the grocery list.  Cuddle with Lydia on couch and watch the last episode of Bear on DVD.  Jonathan wakes up and finishes watching Bear with us.   <br/>\n<br/>\nNow around 4:00 -- play more &quot;princess lydia.&quot; Start to get ready for playdate with friend at friends house. Lydia wears sparkly leotard, tutu skirt, and plastic heels with pink fluff on the front.  We discuss whether to take her normal shoes -- decides to bring them in case she needs them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDrive to playdate (about 40 minutes because of traffic).  In the car, Lydia asks what 100 + 10 equals.  I answer.  But what does 100+20 equal. I answer.  Well, what does 100 + 100 equal?  200, I answer.  MOM! she says, that can&#39;t be right.  100+ 100 is 1,000.  I try to explain why not.  She is unconvinced.  I remind her that she told me that 2 + 7 was 9.  And that 200 + 700 = 900, then thousands, millions, billions. She likes the idea of adding billions.  Repeats 2billion + 7 billion = 9 billion.  Not at all clear that she &quot;gets&quot; the concept, but she likes the words. She counts by 5s (skipping quite a few as she goes).  Hums schoolhouse rock songs to me, to see if I can guess them. We sing all the parts that we can remember together and decide that we need to put the songs on audio tape to play in the car.  She plays peekaboo with her brother and makes up a long involved story sort of under her breath that I can barely hear. <br/>\n<br/>\nAround 5 arrive at playdate.  Lydia and friend (just turned 4) play in yard. Lydia shows off attempts at cartwheels and handstands.  Find a fly and count its legs.  Find a bug that looks like an ant with wings -- Lydia decides to call it a &quot;flutter ant&quot; and declines offers to find out its &quot;real name.&quot;  Plays with sand table.  Go inside and play dress up, pollies, barbies (the pollies are toys that come to life and some halloween witches try to get inside the castle, and the barbies all hide -- I am told afterwards).  Make a tent and play in it.  Listen to friend&#39;s mom read a story.  Play more barbies (friend just got swan lake castle for her birthday).  Eat dinner.  After dinner Lydia and friend play in the living room with a pretend mop and a weasel-ball. <br/>\n<br/>\nLeave around 9:00 (the playdate friend has to go to bed in time to get up for pre-school the next morning).  Talk in car about whether Lydia wants barbie castle for upcoming birthday.  She decides that she would rather have bear-shaped chair from IKEA (her currently outstanding request).  Thinks it would be fun for us to make a barbie castle. I agree.  Drive home  both zoning out with very little talking.  Baby sleeping. <br/>\n<br/>\nGet home around 9:30 -- DH is out late for work (fortunately a rare occurence).  Play Scooby-Doo computer game on the second level.  Decide it isn&#39;t much different from the 1st level, except for having 2 fake clues instead of 1 in the 5 clues given to solve the villian.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDH home around 11:00.  He plays with children in the living room -- I hide in kitchen and eat more popcorn and read more Mothering Magazines and try to get some alone time -- interupted by various needs and requests.  Clean 3/4s of the kitchen, then interrupted to nurse baby to sleep around 12:00 -- while DH finishes cleaning the kitchen and does some vacuuming.   Read emails on desktop because Lydia asks me to be in the same room while she plays computer game on laptop -- sleeping baby on my lap (another kind of laptop!). DH goes off to iron shirt for next day and catch up the household accounting on quicken on the basement computer.   DH returns and he and Lydia brush her teeth.  She, I and the baby go to bed around 12:30.<br/>\n  <br/>\nAnd so to bed. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Little kids unschooling days was Re: teens - &quot;watch out!&quot;","postDate":"1069763177","msgId":85328,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJwdmhwOStzZXExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJwc2ZkYStucW9uQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":85320,"nextInTopic":85334,"prevInTime":85327,"nextInTime":85329,"topicId":85223,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When I read about all of you unschooling moms ...

The boys have identical boots but in different sizes and <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t figure out who&#39;s boots were whose.  So I got a permanent <br/>\nmarker and wrote an 11 on the back of one pair and a 13 on the <br/>\nother.  I told Matt, &quot;Your boots are size 13.  This is what a 13 <br/>\nlooks like, so just look for this number when you want your boots.&quot;  <br/>\nI told Luke &quot;Your boots are size 11.  This is what an 11 looks like, <br/>\nso just look for this number when you want your boots&quot;.  They learned <br/>\nwhat the numbers 11 and 13 look like, just because they needed to <br/>\nkeep their boots straight.  (I didn&#39;t write their names on the boots <br/>\nbecause someday Matt&#39;s boots will be Luke&#39;s.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey played for awhile and then came in.  I had hot chocolate waiting <br/>\nfor them and they sat down to watch a Christmas movie.  When the <br/>\nmovie was over, Luke brought me two books to read to him.  One was a <br/>\nBerenstein bears book and the other was Bats on Parade.  It is a book <br/>\nabout multiplication.  One page has two rows of two, one page has <br/>\nthree rows of three, one page has four rows of four, all the way up <br/>\nto ten rows of ten.  Luke had me count the bats on almost every page, <br/>\nand I realized that he was hearing me say, &quot;11, 12, 13...&quot; over and <br/>\nover again.  It&#39;s amazing to me how it works out that kids will find <br/>\nwhat they need exactly when they need it.  He had just learned what <br/>\nthe number 11 and 13 look like from his boots, and now he was hearing <br/>\nme count using those numbers repeatedly.  Not that he has never heard <br/>\nthose numbers before, but he reinforced them for himself quite nicely <br/>\ntonight! <br/>\n<br/>\nA few days ago Matt had 2 piles of something--I can&#39;t remember what <br/>\nanymore.  There were three things in each pile.  He had said to <br/>\nme, &quot;Mom, three and three are six.  I know because I have two piles <br/>\nof three and I counted them all together.&quot; I hadn&#39;t said much at the <br/>\ntime except for &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right&quot;.  But tonight when we were at <br/>\nthe three by three page, I said to Matt, &quot;Hey, remember the other day <br/>\nyou had two piles of three and you told me that three and three are <br/>\nsix?&quot; He said, &quot;Oh, yeah!&quot; And I said, &quot;well, here they have three <br/>\nand three and three!&quot; He came over and looked and said, &quot;Cool, <br/>\nnine!&quot;. Then the boys started asking me all kinds of stuff, <br/>\nlike &quot;What&#39;s five and five and five and five&quot;? I&#39;d say 20 and Matt <br/>\nwould repeat it. &quot;So four five&#39;s are 20?&quot; And they kept doing it over <br/>\nand over and eventually got to really high numbers, like &quot;What are 55 <br/>\n7&#39;s?&quot; And I&#39;d tell them the answer (frantically trying to figure it <br/>\nout without letting them know I was frantic--I didn&#39;t want them to <br/>\nsee my math anxiety) and they&#39;d be like, &quot;Woah!&quot;  They thought it was <br/>\npretty cool that I could tell them what 55 rows of 7 were.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got to the 10 10&#39;s page, when I told Luke that 10 10&#39;s were <br/>\n100, he dramatically sighed and said, &quot;Oh, you made me fall over. I <br/>\ncan&#39;t believe it&quot;. Then he sat back up and giggled and we finished <br/>\nthe book. <br/>\n<br/>\nScience and Math and some other stuff:  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to Hershey, PA on Sunday (The town where they make the <br/>\nchocolate).  We don&#39;t live too far from there and it&#39;s one of Matt&#39;s <br/>\nfavorite places to go.  We had been there just a few weeks ago for <br/>\nthe free tour.  This time we were there for Christmas stuff they were <br/>\ndoing.  Matt had seen a chocolate bar guy stuffed animal in the gift <br/>\nshop that he wanted, so the night before we counted his change to see <br/>\nif he had enough to buy him. (He did!) I showed him how many <br/>\nquarters, nickels, and dimes he had to have in each pile in order to <br/>\nmake a dollar.  I think that he&#39;s starting to understand now that a <br/>\nquarter is more valuable than a dime, because he needed 10 dimes to <br/>\nmake a dollar but only needed 4 quarters.  I told him he&#39;d need a <br/>\nlittle bit extra than the price on the tag because of tax, and I had <br/>\nto explain to him what tax is.  Luke was right there with us, and <br/>\nkept asking what the different coins were called.  Up until that <br/>\npoint all coins were just money.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did all the stuff we had planned on doing.  A trolley ride through <br/>\nthe town of Hershey with the guide telling the history of Milton <br/>\nHershey and the town of Hershey, with a funny guy hopping on and off <br/>\nthe trolley at different points dressed up like different things--a <br/>\nchocolate factory worker, Milton Hershey&#39;s mom, and finally Santa who <br/>\ngave out gifts to the kids.  We also drove through &quot;Sweet lights&quot; <br/>\nwhich was a pretty cool display of Christmas lights, and we bought <br/>\nspecial glasses to wear that make Christmas lights look like <br/>\nsnowflakes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe bought his Hershey bar guy and when we got home, he rigged him up <br/>\nto the chair with string, hid behind the chair, and pulled on the <br/>\nstring to make him wave his hand like the mechanical hershey bar does <br/>\nin chocolate world.  He said it would be neat if he could hook <br/>\nsomething to the string that would make it move by itself without him <br/>\nhaving to pull on the string, so his mind is probably busy trying to <br/>\nfigure that out.  He&#39;s very into levers and pulleys and does stuff <br/>\nlike this all the time.  I&#39;m looking into a trip to a children&#39;s <br/>\nmuseum that I heard has a neat hands on lever and pulley area because <br/>\nI think he&#39;d really enjoy that.  He also told him his theory about <br/>\nhow he thinks they made the wooden tokens that we needed to get onto <br/>\nthe trolley.  His mind was really doing a lot of thinking in a lot of <br/>\ndifferent directions!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWriting: <br/>\n<br/>\nWe took the kids to chuckecheese for the first time this past summer <br/>\nand our house hasn&#39;t been the same since!  Luke has <br/>\nbecome &quot;Chuckecheese man&quot;.  We have done SO many things revolving <br/>\naround his fascination with Chuckecheese.  Making homemade pizza, <br/>\ntouring Dominos, setting games up in the livingroom and pretending <br/>\nthey&#39;re chuckecheese games, setting a play kitchen set with play food <br/>\nup in the kitchen.  Well, Saturday evening we were all relaxing at <br/>\nhome.  We had spent the afternoon shooting off a rocket in a field <br/>\nnear our house and playing on the swings and seesaws.  Luke had <br/>\nhis &quot;Chuckecheese&quot; apron on and asked me to help him make Koolaid.  <br/>\nSomeone also asked me to make warm vanilla milk, so I made that too. <br/>\nLuke went around and got everyone&#39;s drink order and served it to them <br/>\non an old serving tray he had picked up at a flea market.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMatt decided that it would be neat if the Chuckecheese workers had <br/>\nnametags.  He found some blank nametag stickers I had and wrote Matt, <br/>\nLuke, and Mom on the stickers.  He already knew how to write those.  <br/>\nI showed him how to write Dad, so now he has another word that he can <br/>\nwrite. :)  He wanted to write Alisha, but then asked if Sister would <br/>\nbe easier to write.  He ended up writing Sis.  He put the nametags on <br/>\neveryone&#39;s shirts as we drank our hot milk and koolaid.<br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Unschooling small ones","postDate":"1069737700","msgId":85320,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjZC4xNGJlNjM1OC4yY2Y0NDBlNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":85317,"nextInTopic":85328,"prevInTime":85319,"nextInTime":85321,"topicId":85223,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/24/2003 10:53:32 AM Mountain Standard Time, danielle.conger@comcast.net writes: -=-I think in a world where children are going to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1666241261\">In a message dated 11/24/2003 10:53:32 AM Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danielle.conger@...\">danielle.conger@...</a> writes:<br/>\n-=-I think in a world where children are going to preschool younger and <br/>\nyounger, kindergarten is moving to full-day in many areas and pre-k is the <br/>\nnorm, unschooling small children is very possible.-=-<br/>\n=========<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a city or region or social strata where... then yes.<br/>\n&quot;The World&quot; (and Albuquerque, for example) is not much that way, and so when <br/>\na parent of pre-school-age children (by Albuquerque standards) tells me (in <br/>\nAlbuquerque) she&#39;s unschooling, I don&#39;t start the chess timer on her years as an <br/>\nunschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are parents of children who fully intend to send their children to <br/>\nschool who &quot;teach&quot; them all kinds of stuff, label things, drill them with flash <br/>\ncards, etc.  If they intend to send kids to school, they&#39;re &quot;enriching&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;advancing.&quot;   If they don&#39;t intend to send their kids to school and then at the <br/>\nlast minute they do send them, their claims of having &quot;homeschooled for four <br/>\nyears&quot; dissolve, in my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; We play lots of games, which I&#39;d like to do even more of now that <br/>\nwe can break out of the whole Candy Land scene. lol  I bought 3 new board <br/>\ngames for Christmas &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of our best board games have come from thrift stores.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of times I&#39;ve bought a partial set (but for $2, hey....) and later <br/>\nbought another partial, and the two made one with extra pieces!<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo easily available games (Toys R Us, maybe Walmart) are Mastermind for Kids <br/>\nand Yahtzee.

As an academic <br/>\nwho chose not to send my child to daycare, Montessori, etc., I was afraid <br/>\nmy oldest was missing out on learning opportunities by being at home. This <br/>\nwas, of course, a ridiculous fear in retrospect, considering that she was <br/>\nexposed to incredibly rich environments just by living life with us--going <br/>\ninto lab with her father, meeting Nobel laureates, going to the library <br/>\nwith me, exploring the stacks with so many books and colors, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, convinced that she was missing out on something, I began buying <br/>\npreschool books, reading them and implementing their suggestions in our <br/>\nhome. I set up our apartment in &quot;zones&quot;--fine motor, gross motor, dramatic <br/>\nplay, etc. I created a &quot;print rich&quot; environment by printing labels for <br/>\neverything on the computer, laminating them and taping them to various <br/>\nthings throughout the apartment--toybox, wall, cabinet, door, desk, table, <br/>\nyadda yadda. Talk about contrived! But you betcha I was homeschooling my 18 <br/>\nmo! What else could you call it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in a world where children are going to preschool younger and <br/>\nyounger, kindergarten is moving to full-day in many areas and pre-k is the <br/>\nnorm, unschooling small children is very possible. It just looks like what <br/>\nchildren used to be allowed and encouraged to do: play, pretend and just <br/>\nbe. Now, I personally was not unschooling then, I came to that more slowly.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time we moved to Albuquerque and my oldest was 2, I  began unit <br/>\nstudies. This seemed an easy and natural way to expose her to all the <br/>\nthings she was &quot;supposed&quot; to be learning about. Easy in that it gave <br/>\norganization and purpose to our play; natural in that it allowed for <br/>\ndifferent levels of learning, so my 18 mo daughter could learn alongside <br/>\nher older sister. This is when I really began to read all about <br/>\nhomeschooling, realizing that I had been doing this all along and there was <br/>\nan entire movement that involved the same choices I had been making. I <br/>\nbegan to read more about unschooling because I was getting bored of the <br/>\nunit studies and tired of filling in my little preschool curriculum squares.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we moved back east (now in the DC area), completely gutted our home, <br/>\nmy youngest learned to walk in this time, my two girls learned lots of <br/>\nthings, and life just happened without curriculum, however, relaxed it <br/>\nmight have been--there just wasn&#39;t time or space for it in our lives. My <br/>\noldest was 4 by that time--old enough for the pre-k program here. She&#39;s now <br/>\n6 and has been unschooling for the past two years.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh stepped in this September and decided she needed a more structured <br/>\napproach to reading that included daily practice. He convinced her this was <br/>\nthe way to go and left me holding the bag. ARGH! What a total disaster! At <br/>\nfirst, she was amenable to it, things went smoothly. Then she was bored by <br/>\nthe books (they are boring!), so I went and bought some more interesting <br/>\nbooks--Magic Tree House, early chapter books--then she was overwhelmed. <br/>\nThen I was getting mad because she wasn&#39;t following through. Yeesh! It took <br/>\nabout a week before I threw up my hands and said, this isn&#39;t working and I <br/>\nwant no part of it! I didn&#39;t want a part of it to begin with and neither <br/>\ndid she! Told dh point blank that we were not doing it any more, he needed <br/>\nto let go. He did, and Emily, thankfully, recovered quickly for the most <br/>\npart (though I still see effects of those 2 months crop up now and then). <br/>\nThis was about the time I sought out this list, realizing that I was going <br/>\nto need support to stand firm against moments like these in the future. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith three small children (boy did people used to groan when they saw me <br/>\ncoming! Talk about not helpful comments!), we just try to _do_ lots of <br/>\nstuff. We go to museums, science centers, historical places. We read lots <br/>\nof books. We play lots of games, which I&#39;d like to do even more of now that <br/>\nwe can break out of the whole Candy Land scene. lol  I bought 3 new board <br/>\ngames for Christmas and have started to teach the kids how to play <br/>\nchess.  My oldest has been asking for a while, so I finally just broke out <br/>\nthe old chess board instead of waiting for whatever reason. We make <br/>\ncostumes to play dress up. We work in the yard, garden and take care of our <br/>\nfish in the pond.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep trying to find other young homeschoolers in our area, which is not <br/>\nso easy.
