I got up this morning at 5:00 (because that&#39;s when my husband <br/>\nwent to work, and I was wide awake from a stupid dream), decided to start <br/>\nsome bread and get online, and my 13 year old was still up and online playing <br/>\nNeopets and chatting with two friends.  One is in town, and one is in <br/>\nnorthern California, so I know he&#39;s not the only kid up all night or up <br/>\nreally early (in his local also-homeschooled-kid&#39;s case).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe older one, who&#39;s 16, wasn&#39;t in his bed either, but had stayed out gaming <br/>\nlate and so just slept over where he was.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty (mid-kid) went to sleep and asked me to make sure he gets up at noon, <br/>\nto go to a gaming-league meeting at 2:00.   Holly was last seen by me at <br/>\n10:15 last night.  She had rented The Wiz and was going to watch that in her <br/>\nroom, and she borrowed an extra alarm clock so she can get up at 9:00 so <br/>\nshe&#39;ll have time to practice fiddle and then get to a neighbor&#39;s house a few <br/>\nblocks away by 11:00 for Harry Potter Leage at a shop near them.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby has karate at 4:30, so I  figure he&#39;ll be home noonish.  I&#39;m not <br/>\nworried about him.  He&#39;s very responsible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it has to do with unschooling is lots of their learning happens when <br/>\nthey&#39;re awake &lt;bwg&gt;  and it doesn&#39;t all involve me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo of the boys&#39; friends, one female and one male, have been deposere are <br/>\ngreat discussions about all of it.  Critique, sympathy, objection... &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I was asleep, Holly was watching a musical (she&#39;s really interested in <br/>\ntheatre tech and costumes and such) and when she gets up she&#39;s going through <br/>\nher fiddle lessons (three styles at once concurrent with her teacher:  <br/>\nSuzuki, Bluegrass, and something called something like &quot;Just Do It&quot; (I <br/>\nforget, and the notebook&#39;s in Holly&#39;s room).  So I don&#39;t really care what <br/>\nhours she sleeps, I&#39;m just happy that she&#39;s so involved in things that <br/>\ninterest her, and that she&#39;s looking forward to getting up today and doing <br/>\ntwo things SHE chose to do.  I&#39;ll practice with her, but I don&#39;t do Harry <br/>\nPotter with her.

How wonderful though. I <br/>\nwould have loved to have started earlier and had more kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the chores thing. I have read or heard somewhere, not sure <br/>\nwhere, that our &#39;job&#39; if you will as parents is to teach our children <br/>\nand then when they know how, to let them do for themselves. I <br/>\npersonally don&#39;t do this. My kids in the next few months will turn <br/>\n17, 8, 7 and 2. I know they can get their own food and drinks. Most <br/>\nof the time, I do it for them. Not because I feel like I have to or <br/>\nbecause they expect me to, just because I enjoy it. Okay not always, <br/>\nbut then again they do a lot for themselves and me too. My oldest <br/>\ndoes cook but there are many times when I cook for her. There are <br/>\nmany times when she feeds the other kids too. She can do laundry just <br/>\nlike I&#39;m sure if I showed the middle two how to do it, they could <br/>\ntoo. But I usually do it all. No big deal really. I&#39;m doing laundry <br/>\nevery day anyway, what&#39;s another load?<br/>\n<br/>\nEach child does put their own clothes away after I fold it. Sometimes <br/>\nthey help fold and my oldest always folds her own. Not the rest <br/>\nbecause I&#39;m just too anal about how it&#39;s all folded!! They each keep <br/>\ntheir room clean and mostly tidy, although my son is a scatterer. If <br/>\nthat&#39;s not a word, it should be. The baby helps me feed the dogs <br/>\nevery day and they all help with letting them out and playing with <br/>\nthem. My oldest is in charge of the cat box, which is automatic so <br/>\nit&#39;s not too bad. When everyone eats, they each clean off their plate <br/>\nand take their things to the kitchen. My oldest will load the <br/>\ndishwasher and wash things in the sink too. None of these things are <br/>\nreally forced upon them to do. There are times when they slack off on <br/>\nsome and times when they do more. Their allowances have nothing to do <br/>\nwith chores. They get money every week regardless. They are never <br/>\nmade to feel like they have to do them. I guess it&#39;s just the way <br/>\nthey were brought up, just kind of knowing and wanting to take care <br/>\nof their own things. I never told the baby to do these things either <br/>\nand she just follows suit with the rest of them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as bedtimes go, we never really had a set time with any of <br/>\nthem. Even with my oldest being in school, I leave it up to her. She <br/>\nknows what she needs. But at the same time, the kids don&#39;t stay up <br/>\nuntil 1:00 a.m. either. The only reason being that with them being so <br/>\nyoung, they sleep later in the morning and we would have a really <br/>\nhard time doing some of the field trips my local group goes on. These <br/>\nare choices that they made about going and know how they feel from <br/>\nstaying upo too late (late for them) by experience. So as much as it <br/>\nis something they know and decide, I do suggest that maybe it&#39;s <br/>\ngetting a bit late and we have such and such the next day to go to. <br/>\nMy 2 younger girls need more sleep and go to bed earlier than my son <br/>\nwho will be 8 soon. He could probably stay up all night but watches <br/>\nthe clock so he doesn&#39;t sleep too long the next day and miss <br/>\nsomething! As it is, no one is in bed before 11:00 these days. Much <br/>\nlater than my in laws think appropriate!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry I got long winded.
