How amazing all the <br/>\ndifferent things that cause the stomach problems.<br/>\nHere is mine. When I was in first grade, not ever before, right after lunch I <br/>\nwould go out to play for 30 min. (back in the stone age schools used to let <br/>\nkids do that) then back to the class for afternoon classes.  I would then get <br/>\nhorrible cramps and have to lay in the hall (not on the floor, there was a <br/>\nlittle bed behind a screen).  This went on every afternoon for 3 or 4 days.  <br/>\nFinally, the teacher from the next room (a real shrew) came by and told my <br/>\nteacher that It sure was funny to her how I could go out and play before I <br/>\ngot sick.  She said some other mean stuff, all where I could hear.  I went <br/>\nhome and started crying and telling my mom. She went bananas, she was so mad <br/>\nat what the teacher had said.  First, she took me to the dr. he did exam, <br/>\nthen made an appointment to have scratch tests done.  Turned out I was <br/>\nallergic to the world!  Milk and dairy products, citrus (pretty major when <br/>\nyou live in Fla. and have grapefruit growing outside your bedroom window)! <br/>\nPlus chocolate and nylon, that was just to begin with.  At any rate, what <br/>\nhappened was that until I was this age, 6 or 7 this didn&#39;t start to make <br/>\nitself known.  Drs. back then did a lot of allergy testing.  Now days they <br/>\nwant to do other things, so, if your doctor didn&#39;t say anything about <br/>\nallergies, maybe you should check it out.  I had these awful cramps all the <br/>\ntime.  Even after I took the shot series and stuff, I almost died because I <br/>\nhad these awful cramps for several days.  We thought it was from the <br/>\nallergies, and didn&#39;t really do much about it, my appendix burst, and by the <br/>\ntime I got to the hospital, the dr told my mom I would have been dead in 30 <br/>\nmin if I had stayed at home.  this was on a Wednesday night and my parents <br/>\nwere going to prayer meeting.  They said if I wasn&#39;t better by the time they <br/>\ngot home they were taking me to the dr.  I started crying and said I want to <br/>\ngo now. When mom called the dr and told him the symptoms, he had the surgical <br/>\nteam and OR ready for emergency appendectomy, I ended up in the ICU 3 days, <br/>\nnever knew it, had a drain in cause the peritonitis had spread all over.<br/>\nGeesh! sorry to be so long winded.  Point is, people don&#39;t really associate <br/>\ncramps with allergies very often, so it is a possibility you might want to <br/>\nsuggest to your dr.<br/>\nTeresa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"zWAthiyQc9IND8ZZZOLW6MR-mofVRsW_BBG_BTeWCNArEaXIsQXNZQhzuMi1sYq_4MZh0W-jeHk6WDNjXQ4hrlqbWA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] (need help)","postDate":"953049136","msgId":7157,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwMzE0MTYxNy5lMkVHSDBaMTkwNDRAc20wMTAxLnByb21lZGlhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":7155,"nextInTopic":7159,"prevInTime":7156,"nextInTime":7158,"topicId":7149,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Have you tried acidopholous (I know, I know, I can t spell worth figs!).

The theory<br/>\nbehind this was that his problems were caused by upsetting the normal<br/>\n&quot;flora and fauna&quot; that reside in your innerds (anything can do this from<br/>\ntoo much of a particular food to antibiotics to allergies) and yogurt and<br/>\nacidopholous encourage the &quot;good&quot; bacteria and balance your system.

I was nursing him and everyone<br/>\nsaid it was what I was eating, so I completely changed my diet (slowly<br/>\nremoving anything/everything that might be the cause) and that didn&#39;t help.<br/>\n Even LLL gave up on trying to figure something and advised trying the goat<br/>\nmilk routine.  This didn&#39;t help either.  When he reached about 3ish, I<br/>\nstarted giving him the acidopholous and yogurt and that helped somewhat. <br/>\nAnything was better!  We finally figured out that he needed to just pass<br/>\ngas whenever he got the urge.

The doc said she was probably going just enough to relieve herself,<br/>\nbut for whatever reason (too busy playing, etc.) she just wasn&#39;t going<br/>\nenough to empty herself. We began her on a regiment of natural vegetable<br/>\nlaxative, very high fiber diet, and some behavior modification, which<br/>\nincluded sitting on the toilet for 15 min. upon waking, after lunch and<br/>\nbefore bed and asking her several times a day if she needed to go. This,<br/>\ncombined with the fact that she ended up catching a stomach bug and had a<br/>\nweek of diarreah (yuck) seems to have done the trick.
