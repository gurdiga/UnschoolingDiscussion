Encourage it!  When he<br/>\nspells cvhsdlfj and tells you it spells cat, say GREAT, cat!  There is<br/>\nplenty of time for him to learn it the right way and right now his curiosity<br/>\nand enthusiasm for learning is all that counts!  When you are reading<br/>\ntogether, he will eventually connect the letters to the sounds. Reading to<br/>\nyour son is the best way to teach him reading and spelling!  There are some<br/>\nexcellent books out there that help this process.  The Cat-in-the-hat books<br/>\nby Dr. Seuss are good books to start with, they have words that are not in<br/>\nthe English language that make the child stop and think about the word and<br/>\nmake a connection in the brain.  They help immensely!  Just relax and let it<br/>\nhappen!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I did when my girls were smaller was to help them sound out a word<br/>\nwhile reading it to them.  For example I would point to the &#39;C&#39; and say<br/>\n&quot;ku&quot;, then the &#39;A&#39; and say &quot;ah&quot; then the &#39;T&#39; and say &quot;tuh&quot; and then slowly<br/>\nput it all together, &quot;ku-ah-t&quot; and then &quot;cat&quot;  It all happens while reading<br/>\nbooks IMO, he&#39;ll catch on! Relax and don&#39;t worry about it now, it will<br/>\nhappen whether you want it to or not, unless of course you push too much,<br/>\nthen it will turn him off!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some excellent and fun books that help children learn the left to<br/>\nright reading direction.  They are simple mazes that only go from left to<br/>\nright. You can find them at educational stores.  I don&#39;t know how you feel<br/>\nabout work books, but I think if the child finds them fun, they will like to<br/>\ndo it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know, this is coming from a new unschooler!  But when my girls were<br/>\nlittle, I didn&#39;t push them until they hit school age!  I should&#39;ve just kept<br/>\non, huh?!

My son is 5.5yo and he writes his <br/>\nname: SOHJUA (Joshua) He knows his name when he sees it he just <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t write it in the correct order. I used to try to correct him <br/>\nas well. He would be so disappointed that what I saw was what he did <br/>\nwrong that now I just praise him for getting the right letters on the <br/>\npaper. He&#39;s only 5.5 and at least he knows the letters of his name <br/>\nand can recognise his name when he sees it. I guess it is one of <br/>\nthose prewriting skills that they go through. Kinda like when all <br/>\nthey want is to do the same puzzle over and over and over and over <br/>\nand over and...mom has to do it with them till she&#39;s ready to pass <br/>\nout from her brain being understimulated for too long. I would let <br/>\nhim express  himself in his own way and when he is ready it will <br/>\nclick with him that there is a correct order to the letters and that <br/>\neach letter has a sound. If you really wanted to you could do some <br/>\nphonics work with him. He might pick up on it quicker but I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nmake a big deal about  it. Oh, I also wanted to say that when I read <br/>\nto my son I follow my finger under the words. When he reads to me <br/>\nwhether he is paraphrasing or telling his own story he follows his <br/>\nfinger the same way so he understands that we read from left to <br/>\nright. He just hasn&#39;t made it click with writing words. In fact it <br/>\njust hit me that when we play Boggle, Jr. he spells the words in the <br/>\ncorrect order and then points to each letter and spells the word out <br/>\nloud and then reads the word out loud using his finger under each <br/>\nletter as he says the word. He just doesn&#39;t get it with  writing. Oh <br/>\nwell, it will come.

On <br/>\nthe reading backwards, I would just tell him that it reads the other <br/>\nway-pronounce it backwards and forwards and laugh at how silly the words <br/>\nsound when you say them backwards. Show him words like racecar and bob that <br/>\nare the same either way-what are they called?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs he the kind of kid who doesn&#39;t like to be corrected? When my Megan was <br/>\nlittle and put her shoes on the wrong feet, it was okay if I said &quot;other <br/>\nfoot&quot; but if I said &quot;wrong foot&quot; she would get mad. If he is really young, I <br/>\nprobably wouldn&#39;t worry a bit about how he spells things. Its cool that he <br/>\nis into the idea that the letters make words and he wants to play with them. <br/>\nIt might be fun to make signs to hang all over the house together-if you <br/>\nmake them out of construction paper and glue on some yarn and let him hang <br/>\nthem or tape them on to everything-your house will be fun with labels on the <br/>\ndoorknobs and the lamps and the furniture! We used to play a game in the car <br/>\nwhere we would take turns finding something that started with each letter of <br/>\nthe alphabet while driving to town. Its a fun way to get the letter sounds <br/>\ndown. You could even do it with the signs-one time make it to find an A at <br/>\nthe beginning of a word on a sign, next time make it A at the end, or <br/>\nmiddle.<br/>\n<br/>\nLetter bingo is fun-we made all of our cards out of empty graham cracker <br/>\nboxes and when the kids got bigger we changed to word bingo.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenny has a living book on the computer of Dr. Suess&#39;s ABC&#39;s-It doesn&#39;t take <br/>\nlong to recognize that the A&#39;s are all at the beginning of the words when <br/>\nthey light up while saying Aunt Annies Aligator A A A-this is a really fun <br/>\ncd-we all play with it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I am feeling is that your kid is showing an interest and some <br/>\nenthusiasm for letters, so instead of correcting him, make games that <br/>\ninvolve letters, read books and notice the letters, write words, notice <br/>\nwords. Play with words and they will come alive to him and he will enjoy the <br/>\nlessons and beg for more!<br/>\n<br/>\nCathie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Lainie Duro &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lainie@...\">lainie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Reading/spelling...<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 22 Aug 2000 12:56:39 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hey guys.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My son, Monk, has lately been very interested in how things are spelled.<br/>\n&gt;His new thing is to point into the air and say stuff like &quot;yrdq...that<br/>\n&gt;spells DOG!&quot; And right now he is putting his magnetic letters on the<br/>\n&gt;floor and saying &quot;That spells GO!&quot; and the letters ar like &quot;yao&quot; or<br/>\n&gt;something.
