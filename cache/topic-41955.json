It&#39;s cruddy, tiny, and<br/>\ninconvienent, at 25+ minutes from post. But because so many military bases<br/>\nin this area have closed, there&#39;s more housing than needed.  So the army<br/>\nrefuses to pay our housing allowance.  We could, concievably, live off post.<br/>\nBut we&#39;d have to pay it out of my husband&#39;s salary.  Not a chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there&#39;s not enough housing and everybody wants it, then you wait to get<br/>\non post.  Last post, we chose not to live on post because we didn&#39;t feel<br/>\nlike moving again.  However, if you live off post, your housing allowance<br/>\ngenerally covers about 80% of the housing & utilities costs.  On post, it&#39;s<br/>\nall free.  Housing may not be great here, but we have an extra $300 a month<br/>\nto work with because we are on post.  That&#39;s why most people want to live on<br/>\npost if they can (and if the quarters are at least halfway decent).<br/>\n<br/>\nCommanders aren&#39;t *supposed* to have much control over dependents (beyond<br/>\nrequiring that they follow laws), but they do.  They can make the military<br/>\nmember&#39;s life miserable about how their dependents behave.  If the commnader<br/>\nof USArmy Europe ruled that my child HAD to go to school, we&#39;d contest it.<br/>\nBut you can bet that my husband would be updating his resume, too.  Fighting<br/>\nback can cost you your career.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14078,"nextTopicId":41922}}
