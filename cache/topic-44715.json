My daughter did a few courses at college and<br/>\n  hated jumping through the hoops.  She has decided to start her own<br/>\nbusiness.<br/>\n  This is a girl who when interested in a subject will bring home 15 books<br/>\n  from the library, read endlessly, take notes, etc.  Right now she is<br/>\ntaking<br/>\n  a lot of flack from her friends (all at college).  Finally she got them<br/>\noff<br/>\n  her back by telling them she wouldn&#39;t have to wait 4 years to start living<br/>\n  her dream AND she wouldn&#39;t owe thousands of dollars either!
