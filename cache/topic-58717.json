Easier to just pick up the gameboy (or <br/>\nwhatever) and push the troubles back out of the way again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way  you handled, it Brenda, reminded me of  how we started <br/>\nhomeschooling in the first place &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI calmly reached in and said, &quot;Let&#39;s just put school up on the shelf <br/>\nfor a while and see how things go without it.&quot; My oldest child was <br/>\nactually pretty unhappy about that - she couldn&#39;t imagine how she was <br/>\ngoing to be able to have any friends if she didn&#39;t go to school and she <br/>\nLOVED her teacher and lots of stuff about school. I asked her to give <br/>\nit 6 months and promised that she could choose to go back then. I <br/>\ninsisted on it. She did not actually agree, but I just moved on as if <br/>\nshe had agreed because I just KNEW she&#39;d be happier and it would change <br/>\nher life in a major way, for the better.  I was right and, just like <br/>\nhis gameboy, school sat on the shelf and she always knew she could <br/>\nchoose it (although the analogy falls apart here - since she really <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t just keep taking it down and putting it up  - on an <br/>\nhourly/daily basis - like he could with the gameboy).<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Friday, February 14, 2003, at 08:46 AM, Alan & Brenda Leonard wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Joyce wrote...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; If he&#39;s happy then I&#39;d agree.

(He&#39;s 6, by the way.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But it eventually reached a point where I simply stepped in and <br/>\n&gt; removed the<br/>\n&gt; gameboy.  Calmly put it up and told him I think he desperately needed a<br/>\n&gt; break.  He asked once where I was, and I told him.  He didn&#39;t go get <br/>\n&gt; it, and<br/>\n&gt; it hasn&#39;t been mentioned in over a week.  He could have it whenever he <br/>\n&gt; wants<br/>\n&gt; it now, but it&#39;s as though the spell has been broken.  He isn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; needing it<br/>\n&gt; right now, or perhaps he&#39;s far enough away that he sees what happened. <br/>\n&gt;  I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m spending most of my energy and time with him now.

I have a lot less personal <br/>\n&gt; time, a<br/>\n&gt; lot less time when he plays alone, and I feel it.
