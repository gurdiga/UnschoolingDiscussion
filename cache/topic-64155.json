Another...Child is asked<br/>\nrepeatedly to put their things away, they don&#39;t do it, and if told again<br/>\nlook<br/>\nthe parent in the face and say, &quot;No!&quot;  And what about lying?  (I am dealing<br/>\nwith this big time with one of my foster sons right now.)  I really believe<br/>\nin logical/natural consequences, as it takes punishment out of the picture<br/>\nand instead puts the ball in the child&#39;s court...but lying is something I&#39;m<br/>\nhaving a hard time coming up with solutions on.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it would depend on the circumstances as to what I would do. Is the<br/>\nwanted object something big and expensive? Imean what does a candy bar cost?<br/>\nA dollar or two. I would buy the kid a piece of candy. If it&#39;s something<br/>\nlarge and costly, one can find ways for the child or parent to save up to<br/>\nget it for the child. Work together on a goal. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what<br/>\nyou are talking about. I can say that I have never had a child throw a fit<br/>\nin a store. Not for any reason. My children get a couple of dollars a week<br/>\nto spend as they want. So they always have money of their own for things.<br/>\nBuying them a candy bar is something I do when they ask. They go with me a<br/>\nlot, sometimes they do ask, most times they don&#39;t. You have to look at the<br/>\nwhole picture. If the child is always denied, he&#39;s going to keep asking. Or<br/>\nat least have feelings like what he wants isn&#39;t being considered.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I ask my children to clean something up, they have the choice to say yes<br/>\nor no. That&#39;s the way it works here. If I want it cleaned up bad enough, I<br/>\nwill do it myself. If they say no, it might be because there is so much.<br/>\nThen my husband or I or one of the other children will help. That &quot;no&quot; child<br/>\nwill always then help. Joseph&#39;s room was a mess for weeks. Really no floor<br/>\nspace at all. My husband and I asked him to clean it up so my husband could<br/>\nconnect the dsl to his computer. Things had to be moved and there was no<br/>\nroom. It was so overwhelming to him he didn&#39;t want to bother. He started on<br/>\nthe floor some, and his dad went and helped him do a great job. They both<br/>\nactually had fun and their bonding time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLying would be different as to the circumstances and how old the child was.<br/>\nNot sure there&#39;s a general answer I would have.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64410,"nextTopicId":911}}
