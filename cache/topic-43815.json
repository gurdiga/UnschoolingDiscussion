I <br/>\nwould be upset, but I don&#39;t know if I would be able to give them a <br/>\ngood reason WHY the words are wrong.  Just because *I* think they&#39;re <br/>\ndistasteful isn&#39;t a solid answer, I don&#39;t think.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have taught my children that it is wrong to take God&#39;s name in <br/>\nvain.
