My husband who has a dual masters degree in business adminstration and computer science *had* to work in a gas station for three months because he couldn&#39;t get a job anywhere else at the time.  He was underpaid, even for manual labor standards, and worked 12 hour days, with only one day off per week.  He said he was glad for the experience and that one should never think a job is below oneself.  The world may not always be as it is today.  My daughter often says she wants to be a cashier or a yogurt stocker in the grocery store, or a greeter at Wal-Mart, in addition to her desire to be a singer and a spy.  When she sees happy people doing their jobs, she thinks she&#39;d like the job.  She&#39;s just 7, but I think it&#39;s great that she can see herself doing all kinds of things.  Sometimes she talks about creating a job because she sees work that needs to be done while we&#39;re out.  If she could get a job tomorrow, I think she would.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway... if children are used to learning as something that enables them to do things they want to do, of their own accord, if a child *needs* a certain subject to do a certain thing, she will learn it, which is so very different from kids who are forced to learn things all their lives for the sake of a grade.  I know quite a few people who changed their majors in college because the major of their desire required specific math that they were too fearful to take.  Where did that fear come from?  From being forced to do it earlier in life, perhaps before they could grasp the concepts and then made to feel inferior for not getting it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Pardon if I&#39;ve rambled too much... bad head and chest cold, can&#39;t sleep much for coughing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Nichole<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162967824,"authorName":"Dawn Adams","from":"&quot;Dawn Adams&quot; &lt;Wishbone@...&gt;","profile":"bluenosegoddess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] gas station attendants and algebra","postDate":"1108904188","msgId":103755,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOGMwMWM1MTc0YiQ5ODU2MzYyMCQ4ODRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwLjNlZmU5ODIxLjJmNDhmZjE5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103752,"nextInTopic":103757,"prevInTime":103754,"nextInTime":103756,"topicId":103705,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Even <br/>\nthough we all know, at some level, that it is nearly all pretense it is <br/>\nscary not to have all those external sources of validation.

And - they need to realize that they&#39;re not the <br/>\nexception - schooling is not conducive to learning - it isn&#39;t ideal, it <br/>\nis simply convenient.
