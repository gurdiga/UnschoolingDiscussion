Today is one of <br/>\nthose days.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the past conversation for those who missed it.  About a year <br/>\nago, Stanford University professor of political science Dr. Rob Reich <br/>\njoined the NHEN-leg list to discuss his views about homeschooling. <br/>\nThat discussion lasted nearly two months, the script of which is some <br/>\neighty-five pages long.  Read that discussion here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NHENLegClearinghouse/files/ReichPart1.doc\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NHENLegClearinghouse/files/ReichPart1.doc</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NHENLegClearinghouse/files/ReichPart2.doc\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NHENLegClearinghouse/files/ReichPart2.doc</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTwo quotes from Reich&#39;s opening remarks in the discussion are telling:<br/>\n&quot;I consider myself a defender of homeschooling, properly regulated.&quot;<br/>\nAnd<br/>\n&quot;The real issue is the legitimacy of state authority over children. <br/>\nAnd here, I presume, is where we disagree.  I believe that, so far as <br/>\neducation is concerned, parents must share authority with the state. <br/>\nThe state is concerned with the education of children for two <br/>\nreasons.  First, the state has a legitimate interest in cultivating <br/>\nable citizenship.  Second, the state has a role in promoting the <br/>\nindependent interests of children, which include, on my <br/>\nunderstanding, the right to live a life other than the one their <br/>\nparents lead.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn: Despite these outrageous statements which, incidentally, <br/>\nsurvived intact during that long discussion at NHEN-Leg, many - <br/>\nincluding me - dismissed Reich as a &quot;flash-in-the-pan&quot; academic. <br/>\nHowever, recent news suggests otherwise, that Reich at the very least <br/>\nhas the ear of the media. Today&#39;s news: Reich&#39;s material is being <br/>\nread and referenced, just last week, in the article below.  And <br/>\ndespite the article&#39;s overall positive look at homeschooling <br/>\nevaluation in Florida, Reich&#39;s opinion held sway in the negative <br/>\nheadline.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacksonville, FL Times-Union, Sunday, March 16, 2003<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jacksonville.com/tuonline/stories/031603/met_12017039.shtml\">http://jacksonville.com/tuonline/stories/031603/met_12017039.shtml</a><br/>\nHeadline: Home-schoolers tough to test<br/>\nSubhead: Parents adopt many student evaluations<br/>\nReich citations in the article:<br/>\n&quot;If we can&#39;t even know how many kids are being home-schooled, it&#39;s <br/>\nimpossible to carry out a study on how they&#39;re doing on average,&#39; <br/>\nsaid Stanford University political scientist Rob Reich.&quot;<br/>\nAnd:<br/>\n&quot;Studies on the academic skills of home-educated students are <br/>\nunreliable because there&#39;s no way to tell if the sample represents <br/>\nthe overall field, Reich said.&quot;[..]&quot;States could require <br/>\nhome-schooled children to take annual standardized tests like the <br/>\nFCAT, an idea Reich supports. If a child repeatedly fails to make <br/>\nacademic progress, Reich suggested the state should step in and force <br/>\nchildren to attend public schools.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn: Quite a few people have speculated about what Reich would do <br/>\nwhen public schooled students fail to make academic progress - would <br/>\nhe step in and force children to homeschool?

Are the programs thinly disguised homeschooler <br/>\nretrieval programs, bent on gathering homeschoolers back into the <br/>\npublic education fold, trampling independent homeschooling freedoms <br/>\nin the process?  Or, are the programs adding sorely needed <br/>\neducational variety and choice to the options available to all <br/>\nchildren everywhere and worthy of every parent&#39;s support?  Both? <br/>\nNeither?<br/>\n<br/>\nComplicating matters further is a point often lost. In most cases, <br/>\nstudents who enroll in public school homeschool programs become, <br/>\n&quot;legally&quot; speaking, public school students. The repercussions of that <br/>\nfact add grist to the arguments about the definition of <br/>\nhomeschooling, as mentioned in the March 16 update&#39;s &quot;A homeschooler <br/>\nis a homeschooler is...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo help me sort it out - and I don&#39;t have these issues clear in my <br/>\nmind yet - I seek the type of wisdom that Laura, a parent who uses a <br/>\ncharter school program, expressed in a recent post to <br/>\nHEM-PoliticalAction.  Laura said, &quot;I realize that we are in our great <br/>\nschool situation today because of the independent homeschoolers that <br/>\nhave gone before us as well as all of you today that work so hard to <br/>\npromote and protect homeschooling. I think that the best way to <br/>\npreserve the choices we have in education is to protect independent <br/>\nhomeschooling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo our homeschooling freedoms lie in the hands of folks like Laura <br/>\nwho truly understand and support the roots of educational options? <br/>\nJoin the discussion at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HEM-PoliticalAction/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HEM-PoliticalAction/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHowever we think about them, the programs are popping up all over. <br/>\nHere are a few stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nCALIFORNIA - three stories<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.toacorn.com/news/2003/0227/Front_Page/003.html\">http://www.toacorn.com/news/2003/0227/Front_Page/003.html</a><br/>\nThousand Oaks Acorn, Agoura Hills, CA<br/>\nHeadline: School district takes look at home schooling<br/>\n&quot;...Fraisse said that the home-school program would not only be <br/>\ncost-neutral, but might even be cost-positive for the district.
