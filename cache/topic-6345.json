My dad has to<br/>\nstay in MS because of his job, but my mom is thinking about taking the<br/>\nkids (she still has four living at home) back to California because the<br/>\nschools are so much better there.  I&#39;ve discussed homeschooling (and<br/>\nunschooling) with her, but she still thinks that homeschooling is doing<br/>\nassignments at the kitchen table all day long.  So, if there are any<br/>\ngroups that anyone is aware of - my family is in Collinsville - near<br/>\nMeridian - please let me know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelanie in Japan<br/>\nAOL IM: Vouget</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6344,"nextTopicId":6253}}
