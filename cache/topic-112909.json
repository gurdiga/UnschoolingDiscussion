You know the type.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s the aunt that shows up on your doorstep unannounced, but you <br/>\nare still thrilled to see her.  She doesn&#39;t have any children <br/>\nherself and isn&#39;t particularly up-to-date on `best&#39; parenting <br/>\npractices.  She doesn&#39;t care that the children have dirt under their <br/>\nnails, know their manners, or are reading at `grade&#39; level.  For <br/>\nthat matter, she doesn&#39;t even notice.  She&#39;s too busy helping them <br/>\nbuild Lego&#39;s on the floor.  When dinner is announced, she&#39;s the one <br/>\ncarrying the kids in on her back making elephant noises.

I think when my ego or fear gets wrapped up in it <br/>\nall, that&#39;s when assisting turns into controlling or coercion.  An <br/>\naunt loves her children-relatives, but is less likely to tie her ego <br/>\nto them.  She can freely bask in their presence and accept and <br/>\nappreciate them for who they are in the moment.  She doesn&#39;t worry <br/>\nabout their futures, how they will get be &#39;successful&#39; adults or <br/>\nwhat kind of reflection that will be on her &#39;aunt-ing&#39; skills. When <br/>\nI separate myself, then I am freed up to think of all kinds of <br/>\nthings to `help them know what THEY need&#39;.

I envisioned it as a kind<br/>\nof cheat sheet for myself, something to put on the fridge to keep the<br/>\nwhole picture in mind as often as possible as I digest it all. As a<br/>\ncheat sheet, I&#39;m leaving the tv/food/chores portion un-fleshed out,<br/>\nthough Joyce&#39;s comments on this section are fabulous and true.  If this<br/>\nlist were to be used for more general consumption then fleshing out<br/>\nthose points does seem important.  I added more FUN (good point!) and<br/>\nremembered the &#39;turn have-tos into choose-tos&#39; tool, and also added<br/>\nBREATHING DEEPLY.  I also tried to get a little more of what Joyce was<br/>\ntalking about creative brainstorming-that there are always more options<br/>\nthan the knee-jerk part of me thinks there are... so here is my current<br/>\nshorthand Essence of Unschooling for the Fridge List...<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nPrinciples of Unschooling<br/>\n <br/>\n1- Let go and Trust<br/>\n-Let go of learning, as a focus, a concern, an issue -trust that it<br/>\nhappens<br/>\n-Let go of trying to control your child -trust they know what they need.<br/>\nEspecially look at The Big Five favorite parental control areas: Chores,<br/>\nSleep, Food, Media, & Personal Hygiene <br/>\n <br/>\n2- Primary Goals: Joy, Connection, Fun <br/>\n-Parent&#39;s job (since it isn&#39;t the controller of the child) is to be the<br/>\nProvider of Joy.  When in doubt, go for the option that offers the most<br/>\njoy.  Ask &quot;Is this Fun?&quot; and if the answer is no, question doing it.<br/>\n-Turn &#39;I have to&#39; into &#39;I choose to&#39; wherever you notice you aren&#39;t<br/>\nhaving fun or are sulking, blaming, or being grumpy to yourself or your<br/>\nfamily<br/>\n-Pursue excellent family relationships.  Make deposits here, not<br/>\nwithdrawals. Relationships based on respecting everyone&#39;s needs and<br/>\ninterests, empathy, and fun together. Be each other&#39;s allies not<br/>\nadversaries.  <br/>\n <br/>\n3- Become a Better Person<br/>\n-Principles over Rules - you must model principles (rather than enforce<br/>\nrules) therefore you must LIVE them (which makes you a better person).  <br/>\nSome examples: Freedom, Golden Rule, Kindness, Respect<br/>\n-Staying in the Moment - mindfulness, play, connection, and joy all<br/>\nhappen in the present moment, not the future (worry) nor the past<br/>\n(fears).  Kids are already the masters of this so learn from them.<br/>\nChildhood is not a preparation for life, it IS life.  BREATHE.<br/>\n-Be someone they want to spend time with<br/>\n <br/>\n4- Tools for Daily Life<br/>\n-Create a Rich Environment:  strew stuff they might like (but don&#39;t be<br/>\nattached to them liking it)<br/>\n-Ride the Waves:  of interests and passions (yours and theirs), as well<br/>\nas the flow of the day<br/>\n-Follow Your Heart: and encourage them to follow theirs.  <br/>\n-Creative Brainstorming:  about any situation until everyone&#39;s needs can<br/>\nbe met as well as possible.  There is always a third (and fourth and<br/>\nfifth) option to disaster and saying NO to your child.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143181466,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"&quot;Melissa&quot; &lt;melissa4123@...&gt;","profile":"melissa4123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Computers & kids was (Principles of Unschooling?)","postDate":"1143215577","msgId":113004,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUwMTRrcCtpcDA3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDZCMUE1ODQ3LTNGOUUtNDUxNy1BOTkzLTJFRjM3MTVFNzE2M0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":113000,"nextInTopic":113008,"prevInTime":113003,"nextInTime":113005,"topicId":112909,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Just a funny note on the computer thing.

A lot has happened which I won&#39;t <br/>\nbore you with but, I read this post this morning and just had to say <br/>\nsomething.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose I&#39;m responding to this particular quote because food, <br/>\nbedtime, and TV have always been my hot buttons and I wanted to <br/>\nshare with you some things I&#39;ve discovered with my daughter (who is <br/>\nsoon to be 5).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose a lot of what I do with my own daughter is because I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant her to grow up with the same &quot;hang ups&quot; about food (&quot;you better <br/>\neat everything on your plate&quot; which I still struggle with), TV (and <br/>\nhow it rots your brain), and bedtimes (I used to lay awake for hours <br/>\nbecause I wasn&#39;t tired).  My response to ensure my daughter didn&#39;t <br/>\ngrow up that way was extreme to most of the people I knew at the <br/>\ntime.  I let her tell me when she was hungry (and full), when she <br/>\nwas tired, ect from the day she was born.  At the time, I didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow that was called &quot;Unschooling&quot; I just knew that it worked for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe (my husband, daughter, and I) very rarely eat all together.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t like the traditional breakfast and usually eat a sandwhich or <br/>\nsomething.  My daughter hates to eat when she first wakes up so I <br/>\nusually end up making her something late morning, when she tells me <br/>\nshe is hungry.  Sometimes it eggs and bacon, sometimes it mac and <br/>\ncheese and a hot dog. :) Since I ate earlier, I&#39;m hungry at <br/>\nthe &quot;normal&quot; lunch time.  While I&#39;m making myself something, she&#39;ll <br/>\nusually say &quot;I&#39;m not hungry yet, mommy.&quot;  So I tell her to just let <br/>\nme know when she is and we&#39;ll get her something.  I sometimes have <br/>\nto ask because she&#39;s so busy playing and running around that she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t always remember until she STARVING!!  When she does realize <br/>\nshe&#39;s hungry, she tells me what she wants, we fix it, she&#39;ll take it <br/>\nto her room or the living room (where ever she happens to be <br/>\nplaying) and eat it on the go.  I hate forcing her to sit at the <br/>\ntable and eat everything until her plate is clean.  Dinner is <br/>\nusually when I try to have us all sit down together.  However, a lot <br/>\nof times, my daughter is not hungry so she sits next to her daddy <br/>\nand shares her day with him.  Then she&#39;s off and running and will <br/>\ncome to be and tell me when she&#39;s ready to eat.  My family thinks I <br/>\nam crazy but, I&#39;m not the one fighting with my kids every night <br/>\nat &quot;dinner time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the TV, she is like me in that way.  I like to have noise on <br/>\nin the background though a lot of times, I&#39;m paying no attention to <br/>\nit at all.  She has a TV in her room and it&#39;s usually on all day.  <br/>\nHowever, she is not sitting in front of it like a robot.  She <br/>\nwatches it when something interesting comes on and doesn&#39;t other <br/>\ntimes.  Again, my family members can&#39;t believe I let her have a TV <br/>\nin her room.  &quot;If I let (fill in the blank) have a TV in her room, <br/>\nall she would do is watch TV all day and night.&quot;  When I tell them <br/>\nthat&#39;s not the case with us, they simply don&#39;t believe me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never had a set bedtimes.  My daughter used to go to bed late <br/>\nand get up late.  I like to go to bed early and wake up early.  When <br/>\nI was ready for bed, I would say &quot;Ok, mommy is going to lay down.&quot; <br/>\nand I would lay down on the couch while she was still playing.  She <br/>\nwould pat me on the head when she was ready for bed and we would go <br/>\nup together.  However, that got old quick because she didn&#39;t have me <br/>\nto play with.  She would ask me to play with her and I would <br/>\nsay &quot;No, mommy is tired so I&#39;m not going to play but, you can stay <br/>\nup and play if you want.&quot;  These days, she&#39;s going to bed earlier at <br/>\nabout 9pm or so but, I suppose her bed times will change as she <br/>\ndoes.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s long winded enough for now.  :)  I hope this helps you in <br/>\nyour journey to Unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Principles of Unschooling?","postDate":"1143117170","msgId":112968,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZGOEEyRjM2LUJFQTctNEQ2Qy1BOUZCLTNEMDE0NUFCRUFGNkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTkwMWM2NGMyYyRkMmFjN2Y3MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBTMDAyNTM4Nzg3Mz4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMTkwMWM2NGMyYyRkMmFjN2Y3MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBTMDAyNTM4Nzg3Mz4="},"prevInTopic":112959,"nextInTopic":112999,"prevInTime":112967,"nextInTime":112969,"topicId":112909,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Great list :-) ...

So, here it is:<br/>\n<br/>\nPrinciples of Unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Let go and Trust<br/>\n-Let go of learning, as a focus, a concern, an issue -trust that it<br/>\nhappens<br/>\n-Let go of control of your child -trust they know what they need<br/>\n-Some examples: no chores, no bedtimes, no eating controls, no limits on<br/>\nmedia<br/>\n<br/>\n2- Joy and Connection as Primary Goals<br/>\n-Parent&#39;s job (since it isn&#39;t the controller of the child) is something<br/>\nlike being the Provider of Joy.  When in doubt, go for the option that<br/>\noffers the most joy<br/>\n-Family Relationships.  Make deposits here, not withdrawals.<br/>\nRelationships based on respecting needs and interests, empathy and fun<br/>\ntogether. Being each others allies not adversaries.  <br/>\n<br/>\n3- Being a Better Person<br/>\n-Principles over Rules - you must model principles (rather than enforce<br/>\nrules) therefore you must LIVE them (which makes you a better person).  <br/>\nSome examples: Freedom, Golden Rule, Kindness, Respect<br/>\n-Staying in the Moment - mindfulness, play, connection, and joy all<br/>\nhappen in the present moment, not the future (worry) nor the past<br/>\n(fears).  Kids are already the masters of this so learn from them.<br/>\nChildhood is not a preparation for life, it IS life.<br/>\n-Being someone they want to spend time with<br/>\n<br/>\n4- Tools for Daily Life<br/>\n-Create a Rich Environment:  strew stuff they might like (but don&#39;t be<br/>\nattached to them liking it)<br/>\n-Ride the Waves:  of interests and passions (yours and theirs), as well<br/>\nas the flow of the day<br/>\n-Follow Your Heart: and encourage them to follow theirs.  <br/>\n-Creative Brainstorming:  about any situation until everyone&#39;s needs can<br/>\nbe met as well as possible<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve got.  Where am I missing the boat?  So far this<br/>\nlearning has been so exciting and good for our family.  Can&#39;t wait to<br/>\nkeep going...<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\nMaya</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112589,"nextTopicId":113044}}
