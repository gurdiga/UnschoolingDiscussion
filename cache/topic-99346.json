I *had* to grin back (though the voices in my head were loud,<br/>\ninsisting I interrogate him) and that grin gave me this:<br/>\nH: I spilled my pop and I cleaned it all up and now I&#39;m gonna dry these<br/>\npapers!<br/>\nHe proceeded to turn the fan on at various speeds, gleeful as the papers<br/>\nfilled the air!<br/>\nH: Careful mama, you might get a papercut from the flying papers!<br/>\nSTILL WITH THE GRIN! and not a word from me, a pure love moment, I let him<br/>\nhave it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI got up this morning and ignored the papers all over the ding dang house...<br/>\nno I didn&#39;t, I silently grumbled about them... THEN I remembered my boy&#39;s<br/>\nshining face last night :)  Picking up every paper encouraged me to relive<br/>\nevery drop of joy he felt watching them sail thru the air.  Now they&#39;re all<br/>\nneatly stacked, a bit more brown than yesterday, completely ready for the<br/>\nnext project they&#39;re called upon for... and my heart is filled with joy!<br/>\n<br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.752 / Virus Database: 503 - Release Date: 9-3-2004</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99321,"nextTopicId":99349}}
