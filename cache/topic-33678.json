Your kids sound alot like my children. Well I had this Math conversation with a trusted friend of mine who is a homeschooler and leaning more and more towards unschooling every day. Her arguement for the math curriculum was very legitimate. She says dont the kids need math in some sort of order and doesnt it need to be built on? Meaning doesnt learning math need to be like a stair case, where you start with a step and learn and add more as you go up the stair case. (is this making sense?) I could understand exactly what she meant and I tried to point out that it is more for the teachers that they teach math this way. It is easier for them to start teaching in September if they know where the teacher left off in June.

My dad never learned to read because he skipped school throughout<br/>\nchildhood because of running away from his abusive father so much.  So,<br/>\nhow did he learn math?  I used to see his writing on cardboard and boards<br/>\nin the barn figuring out how many bails of hay he&#39;ll need to get through<br/>\nwinter or how much he&#39;ll need to spend on grain, or charge for services. <br/>\nYou see, when he ran away from home it was to his sister&#39;s ranch to hang<br/>\nout with the horse show and rodeo cowboys.  He learned to rope and ride<br/>\nand care for animals, to do everything he later did as a very successful<br/>\nrancher.<br/>\nI remember when I was in the fourth grade, looking at my seventh grade<br/>\nsister&#39;s math and yearning to do it.  They were using graphs and axes. <br/>\nIt looked so fun.  I could not figure out why they were going to make me<br/>\nwait three years to do it.  As it turns out, the only math I ever loved<br/>\nin school was Geometry and Trigonometry.  That&#39;s because we were really<br/>\ndrawing.  I didn&#39;t know it then, since they killed my passion for math,<br/>\nbut that is the foundation of computer programming.  <br/>\nMy brother works for microsoft and he was allowed to pursue his passions.<br/>\n My stepmom let him get into all sorts of stuff when he was little.  He<br/>\nwould dismantle our phonographs, tape-recorders and blow-dryers.  When we<br/>\ncomplained, he put them back together.  He would watch my dad fix the<br/>\ntruck, and understood how an engine worked when he was only four years<br/>\nold.  My brother almost didn&#39;t graduate high school, from all his f&#39;s in<br/>\nEnglish.  He skipped English to go to the computer lab and play with<br/>\ncomputers.
