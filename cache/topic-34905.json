I don&#39;t remember the<br/>\nlast time I was bored and my kids have rarely mentioned it since they left<br/>\nschool.  Sometimes I suggest things, sometimes the kids do.  Sometimes we<br/>\naren&#39;t doing much of anything, watching the stars, watching a movie, hanging<br/>\nout (today I&#39;m doing laundry, one kid is napping, 2 are playing their own<br/>\ncreation of a game, 2 are watching &quot;gunsmoke&quot;)...but we almost always find<br/>\nthe world fascinating.  We talk about how things fit together and are<br/>\nconnected.
