I do unschooling or I often say child led<br/>\nlearning or interest based and we are a mixed religious home.   One of<br/>\nmy homeschooling friends has used Oakmeadow and is a bit more flexible,<br/>\nwe&#39;ll be getting together to do things.  We do have a co-op.  The<br/>\nclasses are segragrated somewhat by age.  They are K-3rd and 4th grade<br/>\non up.  The break down is somewhat flexible.  Also my son who is 6<br/>\nwanted to do the older class and I just came with him.   I taught the<br/>\nare classes and it was a group of 10 K-3 boys which had included one 3rd<br/>\ngrade girl and we put her in the next group.  We will be planning our<br/>\nnext set of classes in two weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry from Upper Michigan in a community of 20,000.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12935,"nextTopicId":13003}}
