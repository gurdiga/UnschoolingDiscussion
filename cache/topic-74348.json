Some people walk up to a piano and figure it out and just <br/>\nplay songs.  Others, with lessons for years, can&#39;t do anything EXCEPT follow <br/>\nthe dots on the paper, with no musicality, no feel for it, purely mechanical.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while pure mechanics is better than nothing, it&#39;s not how everyone learns <br/>\nmanners or piano.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone&#39;s not big in the interpersonal, intrapersonal, they&#39;re not going <br/>\nto be paying attention to how their mom introduces people.  Those who ARE will <br/>\nnotice who she addresses first, and what kind of information she offers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone who&#39;s not very musically talented can be in a house full of music, <br/>\nmusicians, live music and lessons all around them and STILL never harmonize by <br/>\near.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was reading about Martha Stewart this morning, when I first woke up, and TV <br/>\nwas previewing something about Jack LaLanne.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought  WOW!!!   <br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t want to say what all I next thought. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMartha Stewart can&#39;t teach people how to be her.  She can show them her <br/>\nthought processes and sell them some pillow cases and mixing bowls, but if they <br/>\ndon&#39;t have the talent already, it won&#39;t really help.  (Those are talents I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave, so I know.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJack LaLanne is a happy freak of nature who could have been a circus <br/>\nstrongman if television hadn&#39;t given him a medium and an outlet.  YES people can do <br/>\nthose exercises and eat right, but they can&#39;t be Jack LaLanne, not a single one <br/>\nof them.   Most of what he has is genetics, physical and tempermental both.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this is interesting:  An interview in &quot;What is Enlightenment?&quot; magazine:<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough an interview with Jack LaLanne about enlightenment and its <br/>\nrelationship to self-mastery may seem incongruous to some, the remarkable thing about <br/>\nthis extraordinary man is that he may indeed embody many of the unusual <br/>\nqualities of those throughout history who are presumed to have been enlightened. <br/>\nAlthough he had no concept of what is usually meant by the word &quot;enlightenment,&quot; <br/>\nand always reduced the solution to every human problem to his perennial <br/>\nprescription of diet and exercise, his ferocious and unwavering single-pointedness of <br/>\nmind seems to have produced in him that one human quality that speaks louder <br/>\nthan a thousand wordsjoy! A true yogi in the classical sense of the word, Jack <br/>\nLaLanne might have impressed even Patanjali as a rare example of <br/>\nconcentration, self-discipline, and integrity. Renunciation and self-control, the pillars <br/>\nof any real practice of yoga, are Jack&#39;s intimate friends, and while he <br/>\nappeared to be at a loss whenever asked about spiritual depth, lightness of being <br/>\nseems to be his natural state.
