I told him that is too much for me; I cannot make anybody do anything, but what we could do is have the children go their rooms at 8:00 and tvs have to stay below a volume level where no one outside of the room will hear it.  He said he didn&#39;t want tvs on all night.  I told him I was willing to stay up until all the children were asleep and then turn tvs and lights off.  Then he said that come to bed after that he would wake up.  I told him I was willing to sleep on the sofa.  He said ok to all this.  I went to each child seperately and explained that Mike needed more sleep and the solution that we came up with.  The children were all in agreement.  I also told Dh that we would try for a week and make changes when needed (to let him know that I am flexible here).  Everyone was in agreement until Mike went to bed.

I find that by doing this there is no need for a punishment.  My dh thinks that there must be a punishment in order for the children to learn the lesson.  I feel like putting a cute picture on the wall that also says, Parents who punish their kids, do not know How to solve the problem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not even know what to punish the kids with.  I can&#39;t ground them because that is keeping them and rest of the family from society (learning opportunities), I can&#39;t ground them from tv (learning opportunities) , I can&#39;t ground them from the computer, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nI am open to all suggestions, and please tell me what I NEED to hear not what you think I WANT  to hear.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My best teacher was my dog; the world is my classroom.&quot;---Jane Goodall<br/>\n&quot;And to all young people, in mother&#39;s words; &#39;If you really want something, and really work hard, and take advantage of opportunities, and never give up, you will find a way.&#39; Follow your Dreams.&quot; ~ Jane Goodall<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
