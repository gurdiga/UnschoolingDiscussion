When she was small I was an apartment<br/>\nmanager and also did childcare and tutoring.  When the<br/>\nsecond one was six, the first one (age 16 then) and I<br/>\nbegan working outside the home.  We worked opposite<br/>\nshifts in order to take turns being with the younger<br/>\none.  We&#39;re doing that again now, after four years of<br/>\nliving thirty miles apart.  During the time of<br/>\nrelative separation from the older girl, the younger<br/>\none spent some days with her and some days with<br/>\nvarious neighbors.  Most of the neighbors were people<br/>\nI could exchange chores, errands, and favors with<br/>\ninstead of paying.  Some were just older people who<br/>\nloved having my daughter around for the day once in a<br/>\nwhile.  I preferred not to depend on a paid parental<br/>\nsubstitute.  I&#39;ve worked full-time since the younger<br/>\none was six.  Now she&#39;s thirteen.  She has reading and<br/>\nprojects to work on while I&#39;m at work, and I spend my<br/>\noff hours and days with her.  We work on whatever<br/>\nquestions or interests are on her mind, I take her to<br/>\nclasses and activities in the community.  This past<br/>\nyear I&#39;ve worked about five miles from home.  Before<br/>\nthat, I was never more than a five-minute walk.  The<br/>\nyear the little gal was six I worked across the<br/>\nstreet.  I always went home for lunch and called<br/>\nduring breaks, and always made it clear to co-workers<br/>\nthat I must be paged for calls from my kids because<br/>\nthey wouldn&#39;t be calling if it weren&#39;t important.  I<br/>\nwas much less interested in doing work I liked than in<br/>\nbeing close by and available to my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m only responsible for one childhood per daughter<br/>\nand I intend to make it the best possible.  Giving<br/>\nthem my self is better than anything else I can offer.<br/>\nI know everyone&#39;s situation is unique, and each one&#39;s<br/>\ntolerances are different.  I offer this story as a<br/>\nsample.    <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
