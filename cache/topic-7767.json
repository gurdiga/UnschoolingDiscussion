Tonight, I was reading my e-news. In the<br/>\n&gt; entertainment section, there was a focus on the song &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot; by the<br/>\n&gt; Dixie Chicks (Country). It stated that 20 out of 149 radio stations chose<br/>\n&gt; NOT to play this song because a battered woman plots and kills her abusive<br/>\n&gt; husband in it. I wrote a letter to Lon Helton (of Country Countdown USA)<br/>\n&gt; regarding that particular song. I am open to any and all comments PRIVATELY.<br/>\n&gt; The letter is below. I would like to know what your thought are. thanks.<br/>\n&gt; Stephanie<br/>\n&gt; Mr. Lon Helton<br/>\n&gt; Country Countdown USA<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mr. Helton,<br/>\n&gt; I am writing this in regard to the single &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot; from the Dixie<br/>\n&gt; Chicks. As a survivor of DV (domestic violence) I can personally relate to<br/>\n&gt; the feelings that drove Wanda and Mary Anne to poison the black eyed peas.<br/>\n&gt; Domestic violence is much bigger today than is heard of, and unfortunately<br/>\n&gt; is not getting the attention it so badly needs. DV has many forms: physical,<br/>\n&gt; psychological, and emotional; and it is extremely hard for a battered person<br/>\n&gt; to find their way out. I cannot understand why radio stations have decided<br/>\n&gt; not to play &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot;, but they will play Martina  McBride&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Independence Day&quot;. Both songs depict the end of a violent relationship. The<br/>\n&gt; discussion of women plotting their abuser&#39;s death is not new, but the<br/>\n&gt; majority of women do not make it that far. They end up in Intensive Care or<br/>\n&gt; die. Many women may think of &quot;getting back&quot; at their abuser, only to<br/>\n&gt; immediately dismiss the thought, since if caught thinking such a thought<br/>\n&gt; could (and would) provoke another beating.<br/>\n&gt;     Domestic violence needs to be put into the media, and if this is a way<br/>\n&gt; to get DV noticed, then I am all for it! Please feel free to contact me for<br/>\n&gt; any questions or comments that you may have- I am more than willing to<br/>\n&gt; share.
