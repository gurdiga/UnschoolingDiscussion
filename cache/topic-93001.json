I was getting a pedicure last night and a teacher <br/>\nwas on the side of me of course we talked LOL....................I <br/>\nwas explaining to my son that she was a teacher and that I told her <br/>\nthat we home school because I just don&#39;t tell anyone that we <br/>\nunschool. So my son piped up last night andsaid &quot;Mom you don&#39;t even <br/>\ndo any school with me&quot; also I would like to add he said it with <br/>\nsarcasim LOL....................... Anyway as I am writing I&#39;m <br/>\nfinding my own answer. I need to tell him about unschooling. I think <br/>\nI haven&#39;t is because I don&#39;t want him just telling anyone because he <br/>\nis so honest and I&#39;m still trying to explain to him that just <br/>\nbecause someone asks doesn&#39;t mean we need to share ALL of our <br/>\ninformation LOL...................................... <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I was the person some time ago that was going to go back to <br/>\nwork and have to put my son into school because I couldn&#39;t see any <br/>\nother way(child care). Well I have come to realize that I have seen <br/>\nand felt the effects of unschooling over time and I couldn&#39;t do it <br/>\nbecause it goes against the very grain of my soul. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo....... back to my little wonderful boy I said &quot;well honey you <br/>\nlearn things all the time but if you would like to sit at the table <br/>\nlike they do at school with workbooks and go over things over and <br/>\nover I will if it maks you happy.&quot; his reply was a firm and assured <br/>\nNO !!!!!! So as I am writing this I am realizing I need to be <br/>\nupfront with my son and explain to him. It&#39;s amazing how in the <br/>\nshort time that he went to school he already has it ingrained into <br/>\nhim what learning is !<br/>\n<br/>\nSonya<br/>\nAttleboro, Mass.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92917,"nextTopicId":93002}}
