I don&#39;t think that you really realize what kind of relationship you are<br/>\nmissing out on with your children. I speak from experience here, not with spanking but<br/>\nwith another form of coercive parenting in the guise of teaching our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our case it was ferberizing. Jason had started sleeping longer stretches when he<br/>\nwas 10 weeks old, so when he started waking up during the night when he was around 6 or <br/>\n7 months old I didn&#39;t understand why. One of my friends gave me Ferber&#39;s book and told<br/>\nme that it worked great and that I needed to do it, he would not learn any other way. <br/>\nI read it and did not like the sound of it. But at around 8 or 9 months I finally<br/>\ngave in and we did it (after all, all the parenting mags and experts said we had to<br/>\ndo it). It &quot;worked&quot; like a charm. First night he cried for 30 mins <br/>\n(the longest 30 mins in my entire life), the second for 15 mins, the 3rd for 5 mins <br/>\nand after that all we had to do was read a book or 2, put him in his crib  and he <br/>\nwould go to sleep by himself. No fuss, no muss. We had our evenings to ourselves and<br/>\na very &quot;good&quot; baby. <br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily when he started waking at night again at 12 months, I had found an Attachment<br/>\nParenting board and found out that there *were* kids who were never left to cry it out<br/>\nand who did learn to sleep on their own. That it was extremely normal for babies to<br/>\nstart waking when they had been sleeping well previously (due to a variety of<br/>\ndevelopmental and physical reasons). I was so relieved to have people tell me that my<br/>\ninstincts were correct and that there were other options. It took three months of<br/>\nme trying different things and reading a lot before we got to a manageable balance for<br/>\nboth of us. <br/>\n<br/>\nThose were extremely tiring and frustrating times for me. And I would not trade them<br/>\nfor the world. I learned so much about my son and about myself during that time. I<br/>\ngrew as a mother and as a person. Some of my favorite memories of Jason as a baby are<br/>\nfrom that time. I learned that sometimes you just have to surrender yourself to your<br/>\nreality (not give up, but rather accept it for now). Realize that some things are beyond <br/>\nyour control. And that your children are worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also learned what I was missing those 4 or 5 months that Jason put himself to sleep.<br/>\nI missed rocking and nursing him to sleep. One of life&#39;s few remaining simple pleasures<br/>\nand I had been quilted into thinking that it was wrong. I also found that by gently<br/>\nparenting him to sleep and by responding to him at night that our relationship was taken<br/>\nto a new level. During the months that Jason went to sleep alone, I thought that we<br/>\nhad a wonderful relationship. You could not have told me that we could have an even<br/>\nbetter one. We cuddled a lot during the day, read a lot, had fun a lot. But after I started<br/>\nresponding to his needs at night, we got to know each other on a deeper level. I learned<br/>\nthings about myself and about him (including that he had a dairy intolerance problem that <br/>\nwe had overlooked before and was a large cause of the nightwakings) that I never would<br/>\nhave found if he had continued to be that &quot;good&quot; baby. By forcing myself to look at<br/>\nother options that respected him as a person, I grew as a parent. When Kyle was<br/>\nborn, I was better able to enjoy our night times together from the start. I did <br/>\nnot worry about getting him on a schedule or getting him to sleep longer. I trusted<br/>\nthat he would. And he did. He has always been a &quot;better&quot; sleeper then Jason. Go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, in the short term, spanking does create obedient kids (for some, for others <br/>\nit creates rebellious kids). But what are you missing? I put a lot of thought into<br/>\nhow I parent, try to figure out what is really going on to make Jason act the way that<br/>\nhe is acting. Many times it is in reaction to something that I am or am not doing. <br/>\nSometimes he is in a  bad mood. I am striving to handle things better every day. The<br/>\nadvice that I have gotten on this list has made me a more responsive parent and I<br/>\nbelieve that is helping my relationship with both of my boys. I look at the old timers<br/>\nand see wonderful relationships with their kids. That is what I want. I want a child<br/>\nwho respects me because I respect him. I can only respect him by treating him how I want<br/>\nto be treated. So I do not believe in spanking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure that you feel that you have a great relationship with your children. But what<br/>\nif that relationship could get even better?
