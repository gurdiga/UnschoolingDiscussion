In a message dated 2/20/1 8:33:58 AM:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;This message is regarding a new study being undertaken to look at<br/>\nbreastfeeding practices. Unlike previous research, this study proposes to<br/>\nexamine breastfeeding in mainstream American women. Past studies have<br/>\nlargely looked at low-income mothers, adolescent mothers, and mothers in<br/>\ndeveloping nations. We want to look at mainstream American women for a<br/>\nvariety of reasons. One of these reasons is that this group seems to be<br/>\nmore committed to breastfeeding and more successful at it than other<br/>\ngroups. Thus, <br/>\npart of our aim is to see what factors predict successful breastfeeding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am writing to you to ask your support in obtaining women to participate<br/>\nin this study. Participation requires answering a brief survey by<br/>\nanonymous email. It is our hope that you will ask the members of your<br/>\nrespective lists to respond. The larger our final sample size, the better<br/>\nwe will be able to predict what engenders successful breastfeeding.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe survey and instructions for completion are located at<br/>\n<br/>\nwww4.ncsu.edu/unity/users/s/swweeks/www/breastfeeding_survey.htm<br/>\n<br/>\nAll participants should first read the informed consent statement located<br/>\nat<br/>\n<br/>\nwww4.ncsu.edu/unity/users/s/swweeks/www/informedconsent.htm<br/>\n<br/>\nAll responses must be received by March 5, 2001 to be included in the<br/>\nstudy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny questions should be sent to the Principal Investigator at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:swweeks@...\">swweeks@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie Weeks is a doctoral student in social psychology at North<br/>\nCarolina State University.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your time and your support.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie W.
