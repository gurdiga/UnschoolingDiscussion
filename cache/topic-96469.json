However dh is not away at work. He is sitting<br/>\nacross the room most of the time. One thing that has been useful to me, is<br/>\nif either of us has to go out, on an errand or to some appointment, before<br/>\nthe issue is resolved, we will usually call each other and talk much better<br/>\non the phone than we had in person. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis not interrupting thing is something that can really make any verbal<br/>\ncommunication tough, so I think email - even when he is just over there -<br/>\ncould be a tool I should use more often. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a metaphorical way to explain about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband will say: The sky is red. So you should do such-and-such, and<br/>\nso-and-so. I feel that your are blah, blah, blah. Also yada, yada, yada, on<br/>\nand on and on. And another thing is you blah, yada, on-and-on and so<br/>\nforth...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor usually about 4-6 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile I am thinking, &quot;But the sky isn&#39;t red.&quot; It seems like everything<br/>\nfollowing the false premise is probably also wrong, and it is really hard<br/>\nboth to listen to and to remember all the different ideas, while caught up<br/>\nin the very first erroneous statement.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also believes that saying &quot;I feel you are wrong&quot; is the same as sharing<br/>\nhis feelings. I sent him the NVC website. So far my attempts to use these<br/>\ntechniques have resulted in him getting really irritated - I must be doing<br/>\nit wrong. Validating the other person&#39;s feelings stopped a crazy mob of<br/>\nscreaming Palestinians from calling Dr. Rosenberg a murderer, but it makes<br/>\nmy dh furious.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
