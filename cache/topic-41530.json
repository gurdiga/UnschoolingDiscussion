He hates his former<br/>\nlife at school and is searching for something new. So far, all he can<br/>\nexpress are his regrets and dissatisfactions with his past. It can take a<br/>\nwhile to overcome. He just got out of prison, remember. He doesn&#39;t really<br/>\nknow how to adjust to his newfound freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you draw a line, I&#39;m betting he&#39;ll jump across it right away.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to avoid talking to him as though he is a &quot;problem&quot; child. Keep the<br/>\nconversation about things outside of personality. He needs love and<br/>\nreassurance, not negative judgments about his &quot;nature.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMusic is a wonderful release and a vast outlet for expression. You can&#39;t<br/>\ncontrol the words he might write. Eminem was just such a kid -- middle class<br/>\nwho rejects his former life of abuse and neglect. If your son seems to<br/>\nidolize him, it&#39;s probably worth finding out about that person, instead of<br/>\nassuming that he is a bad person and a bad influence on your son. Most<br/>\nsuccessful musicians and other artists are worthy of great respect in many<br/>\nways.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive your son time, respect his choices, know that he will sometimes try to<br/>\nshock you. He needs your attention. He will not be young for long. Go with<br/>\nit if you can. Be his best friend. You really have no good alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41488,"nextTopicId":41593}}
