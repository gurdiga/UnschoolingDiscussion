According to other&nbsp;reports, the virus may rename or damage those \nfiles.<br><br>By midday Eastern time, a virus scanning system provided on the \nInternet by&nbsp;the Trend Micro computer security company had already detected \nmore than&nbsp;500,000 infected computer files around the world, including more \nthan 350,000&nbsp;in the United States.<br><br>In Britain, about 30 percent of \ncompany e-mail systems were brought down by&nbsp;the virus, according to Network \nAssociates, another computer security firm.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">In Sweden, the tally was 80 percent.<br><br>Much \nlike Melissa, the &#39;&#39;love bug&#39;&#39; spreads by infiltrating a computer \nuser&#39;s&nbsp;address book and sending copies of itself to that person&#39;s \ncontacts.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;the new virus also seemed to be using instant \nmessaging or &#39;&#39;Internet chat&#39;&#39;&nbsp;systems such as ICQ to spread, Computer \nAssociates reported.<br><br>The virus appeared in Hong Kong late in the \nafternoon, spreading throughout&nbsp;e-mail systems once a user opened one of \nthe contaminated messages. It later&nbsp;moved into European parliamentary \nhouses and through the high-tech systems of&nbsp;big companies and financial \ntraders.<br><br>&#39;&#39;I have to tell you that, sadly, this affectionate greeting \ncontains a virus&nbsp;which has immobilized the House&#39;s internal communication \nsystem,&#39;&#39; said&nbsp;Margaret Beckett, leader of Britain&#39;s House of Commons. \n&#39;&#39;This means that no&nbsp;member can receive e-mails from outside, nor indeed \ncan we communicate with&nbsp;each other by e-mail.&#39;&#39;<br><br>In the United \nStates, the &#39;&#39;love bug&#39;&#39; shut down the Florida Lottery Web site&nbsp;and e-mail \nsystem, said lottery spokesman Leo DiBenigno.<br><br>In Asia, Dow Jones \nNewswires and the Asian Wall Street Journal were among the&nbsp;victims. The bug \naffected only e-mail and did not prevent Dow Jones Newswires&nbsp;from \ndistributing financial information to traders. The Asian Wall \nStreet&nbsp;Journal would have no problems publishing, officials there \nsaid.<br><br>But the e-mail systems went wild.&nbsp;<br><br>&#39;&#39;It crashed all the \ncomputers,&#39;&#39; said Daphne Ghesquiere, a Dow Jones&nbsp;spokeswoman in Hong Kong. \n&#39;&#39;You get the message and the topic says ILOVEYOU,&nbsp;and I was among the \nstupid ones to open it. I got about five at one time and&nbsp;I was suspicious, \nbut one was from Dow Jones Newswires, so I opened it.&#39;&#39;<br><br>Once the message \nwas opened, Ghesquiere said, it began sending the virus to&nbsp;other e-mail \naddresses within the Dow Jones computers, blocking people&#39;s&nbsp;ability to send \nand receive e-mail. Victims sometimes received dozens of&nbsp;e-mails, all \ncontaminated.<br><br>&#39;&#39;I have no idea how it got through the firewall,&#39;&#39; \nGhesquiere said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s&nbsp;supposed to be protected.&#39;&#39;<br><br>The virus posed \nits biggest threat to corporate users, because it apparently&nbsp;had the \nability to spread to the first 300 e-mail&nbsp;addresses in \naffected&nbsp;accounts, virus expert Ross Wilson said.<br><br>&nbsp;&#39;&#39;It&#39;s not \npretty,&#39;&#39; said Wilson, the Singapore-based Southeast Asia director&nbsp;of \nSymantec, a U.S.-based company that makes anti-virus software. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s \ngot&nbsp;the capability of spreading very, very quickly.&#39;&#39;<br><br>In Denmark, \nthe parliament, telecom company Tele Danmark, channel TV2 and \nthe&nbsp;Environment and Energy Ministry were all affected starting this \nmorning.<br><br>&#39;&#39;We have no clue how it got in,&#39;&#39; said Hugo Praestegaard of the \nEnvironment&nbsp;and Energy Ministry.<br><br>The virus hit the Swiss federal \ngovernment computer network late in the&nbsp;morning, said Claudio Frigerio of \nthe Federal Office for Information&nbsp;Technology in Bern. The system was \nswitched off immediately to stop the virus&nbsp;from spreading.<br><br>Bank, \nhospital and national television e-mail networks in Switzerland were&nbsp;also \naffected, Frigerio said.<br><br>AP-NY-05-04-00 1225EDT<br><br>Copyright 2000 The \nAssociated Press.
