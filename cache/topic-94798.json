No &quot;sunovabitch,&quot; no squeal or scream or crying, as I <br/>\nrealized at that moment I would&#39;ve done in days and years past.  I just looked at it <br/>\nand calmly thought whether I should leave it or clean it and be late.  I <br/>\nwiped it up calmly, and I wasn&#39;t very late, and I hadn&#39;t had a fit, nor was I even <br/>\nreally sad.  I was strangely serene.

I think now that that may have been what you were <br/>\ntrying to say, Sandra.  This might help Andrea as well. Might not. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis actually happened tonight after reading all these posts.  (I <br/>\nlove it when this happens!)  I walked in my room and Ethan was <br/>\npushing the mattress off my bed to slide down it.  I asked him to <br/>\nhelp me put it back and not to pull the mattress off my bed and <br/>\nexplained to him why.  He left and went back into the living room to <br/>\nwatch tv with the other kids.  Chloe came in my room and was playing <br/>\non my bed, not a problem but she had taken her diaper off so I was <br/>\ngoing to finish the email I was on then get her ready for bed.  Too <br/>\nlate.  She peed on the bed.  While I was getting her dressed and <br/>\nchanging the bed, Hannah walked in and was complaining because <br/>\nNicholette wouldn&#39;t let her hold the guinea pig.  I told her I&#39;d <br/>\ncome help as soon as I was finished putting the sheets on my bed.  <br/>\nLauren came in upset because Hannah took the guinea pig from her, <br/>\nwhich confused me.  So Nicholette walks in crying because she <br/>\n*never* gets to play with the guinea pig because the girls always <br/>\nhave him.  Yet, she was holding him in her hands!  Next thing, the <br/>\nphone rings and my husband needs me to look up directions for him <br/>\nbecause he&#39;s lost and it&#39;s snowing so he needs to get out of the <br/>\nmountains before he gets stuck. While he&#39;s on the phone the other <br/>\nline rings and Chloe comes in crying so he starts griping at me <br/>\ncause he can&#39;t hear and he needs the directions and can&#39;t hang on <br/>\nwhile I get the other line and what&#39;s wrong with Chloe???, she&#39;s <br/>\nscreaming so loud it&#39;s hurting my ear!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAAAHHHH!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nOK, this is a moment when I start to feel really frustrated and <br/>\noverwhelmed.  Everything is happening all at once, I&#39;m being <br/>\nsummoned and pulled in a million different directions and there&#39;s <br/>\njust not enough of me to go around.  I snapped at Chris for not <br/>\nbeing more understanding and suddenly this huge wave of knowledge <br/>\nslammed me in the face.  I was actually thinking, albeit after the <br/>\nfact, about breathing.  About what I had just been reading on the <br/>\nlist.  About how once I start feeling a panic attack coming, I snap <br/>\nand there&#39;s no time between the last straw and snapping.  It&#39;s <br/>\nautomatic.  I feel like my skull is crushing my brain, literally.  I <br/>\nfeel like I&#39;m trapped in a box that is squeezing the breath from my <br/>\nbody.  I DO feel the adrenaline, the energy and I can&#39;t calm down <br/>\nunless I release it.  I feel really desperate at the moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t feel that way tonight but I could sense that it was coming <br/>\non.  And what I realized is that I was too late!  At that point, <br/>\nI&#39;ve long passed the time when I should have just stopped and <br/>\nbreathed.  (Of course, I really need to in those severe moments, <br/>\ntoo, but stick with me here.)  Looking back over my night (all of <br/>\nwhich happened in less than 10 minutes) I did fine with Ethan.  I <br/>\nshould have stopped with Chloe, gotten off the computer and gotten <br/>\nher ready for bed the moment I saw her on the bed naked.  By the <br/>\ntime Hannah came in, I could have handled the guinea pig issue <br/>\nimmediately with all the girls.  It would have saved me the <br/>\nirritation I felt at Lauren and Nicholette and Hannah would have had <br/>\nher needs met immediately.  Problem solved.  By the time Chris <br/>\ncalled and Chloe started crying, those would have been the only two <br/>\nthings I&#39;d have to worry about.  Most likely anyway. &lt;bg&gt;  Chris <br/>\ngetting irritated at me is when I should have stopped and breathed.  <br/>\nJust said, &#39;hang on while I help Chloe&#39; and took a few deep breaths <br/>\nwhile I hugged her then got on with getting his directions.  The <br/>\nother phone call could have been returned since I have call waiting <br/>\ncaller ID.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I have had this rediculous revelation...and I say <br/>\nrediculous because it all seems so basic now that I&#39;ve had time to <br/>\nthink about it...I realize that rarely do I ever feel that <br/>\noverwhelmed out of nowhere.

When you try to vent it by using <br/>\nall your might to hit something or pound you pillow, half an hour <br/>\nlater, you will be exhausted.  Because you are exhausted, you will <br/>\nhave no energy left to feed your anger.  You may think that anger is <br/>\nno longer there, but that&#39;s not true;  you are simply too tired to <br/>\nbe angry.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, (and he mentions a New York Times article about some research <br/>\nsupporting this) he says:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;While you pound the pillow, you are not calming or reducing your <br/>\nanger--you are REHEARSING it.&quot;  (Emphasis mine.) &quot;If you practice <br/>\nhitting a pillow everyday, then the seed of anger in you will grow <br/>\neveryday.  And someday, when you meet the person who made you angry, <br/>\nyou may practice what you have learned...It is dangerous...(By <br/>\nrehearsing your anger,)Instead of lessening your violence and anger, <br/>\nyou become more violent and angry.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI intuitively know this is the truth based on my own experience.  I <br/>\nam trying to learn to BREATHE.  I truly appreciate all the advice <br/>\nand kind words I am reading, but I have to say that other than <br/>\nrelating to the &quot;plunging&quot; idea and feeling some true empathy, it <br/>\nisn&#39;t something I&#39;m considering. <br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=-I don&#39;t get that.

I haven&#39;t spanked my kids since we had a <br/>\nspanking discussion here last year and if I&#39;m not mistaken, someone <br/>\nactually used the pillow example.  Punching or screaming into a <br/>\npillow, I think.  I was having a terrible time with the plumbing and <br/>\none day noticed how relieving it was to plunge it.  (At that time <br/>\nthe anger stemmed from the clogged toilet.)

My middle son was a terror, and I had no idea what to <br/>\n  do with him :)<br/>\n  &gt; And I had a husband coming home each night.  There were a few days <br/>\n  I met him at the door with my car keys, and just took a drive when <br/>\n  he got home.  I only went for a short time, maybe half and hour, but <br/>\n  as you probably know well, even that can help.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; I too care about our belongings (furniture, house)  We have a some <br/>\n  gorgeous furniture from my parents, and an equally beautiful house.<br/>\n  &gt; The kids have always been taught to be respectful of the things we <br/>\n  have, but when accidents happen, they are just that....accidents.  <br/>\n  Some things we put in the attic when the kids were younger.  Some we <br/>\n  haven&#39;t even brought out yet!  But, mostly we try to balance it all.<br/>\n  &gt; I do talk to them about picking up and putting away after <br/>\n  themselves.  With five of us in the house, if we didn&#39;t do that, we <br/>\n  would be knee deep in stuff, and we wouldn&#39;t be able to find <br/>\n  anything.  I personally can&#39;t live that way either.<br/>\n  &gt; Having said all that, we have art supplies all over our kitchen <br/>\n  counter, that keep blowing on the floor from the open widows.  We <br/>\n  also have art supplies on a table in the living room where my <br/>\n  daughter has been painting.  The kitchen itself is a mess from <br/>\n  dinner...bad me!  But I&#39;ll get to it in the morning.  lol<br/>\n  &gt; The kids rooms are in various states at different times..  <br/>\n  Sometimes a complete disaster while they are busy with <br/>\n  something...like creating lego vehicles, and when that phase is <br/>\n  over, then we go through getting reorganized.  They don&#39;t like the <br/>\n  picking up, but they do love it when their rooms are organized where <br/>\n  they find things again.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; I think there is a balance you have to find.  Some mess, some <br/>\n  sanity.  Forgive yourself more...this is a hard time.  But remember <br/>\n  that ultimately the kids are the most important.  Climbing into a <br/>\n  hugely messy bed together and reading books will be much more <br/>\n  satisfying if you allow it to be.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Remember that explaining instead of yelling usually works better.  <br/>\n  Kids like to be helpful to their Mommies.  They can be great helpers <br/>\n  if you explain how important they are to you and what you are doing <br/>\n  at the time.

I&#39;m reading this thread starting <br/>\nhere, so forgive me if some of this has already been said.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my husband is out of town, I can count on feeling this way <br/>\nseveral times a week.  I feel very alone sometimes and get <br/>\noverwhelmed easily with anything, not just the kids and chores.  I <br/>\ncried last week because my grandmother told me I had been pulling up <br/>\nnewborn flowers and had let three weeds grow into healthy, thriving <br/>\nbushes.  I had no clue what was what.  But it sent me into a <br/>\ntailspin!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I get overwhelmed with the kids and feel like I could burn the <br/>\nhouse down or put us all out of our misery, I just have to stop.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t speak, I don&#39;t move.  I just stand still.  If I can&#39;t settle <br/>\ndown enough to breathe, I run to the bathroom.  Then I shut the door <br/>\nand plunge the shit out of the toilet!  Usually, there&#39;s not even <br/>\nshit in the toilet but for some reason, it really helps.  It&#39;s <br/>\namazing sometimes how much energy you can spend plunging a toilet!  <br/>\nSometimes I cry when I do it, but usually I&#39;m so focused, I forget <br/>\nabout anything but how tired it makes me.  By the time I&#39;m done, I&#39;m <br/>\nusually over whatever was happening enough to see clearly, or <br/>\nclearly enough anyway, to remember my breathing techniques, if <br/>\nnothing else.  And hey, with a house full of kids, it&#39;s probably <br/>\nsaving me a lot of money in plumbing bills, right!?!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes practice, whatever you choose as your outlet, but it won&#39;t <br/>\ntake long to learn to stop before you freak out.  You&#39;ll stumble <br/>\nmany times and wonder how your kids will ever grow up to be sane, <br/>\nmuch less alive, but eventually, it will get better. You&#39;ll find <br/>\nthat the little things start to roll off your back and after a <br/>\nwhile, the big things will be manageable.

Yesterday I went out to the patio and got this long scrap of<br/>\n<br/>\nremnant carpeting that was just about the length and width of the hallway<br/>\n<br/>\nand laid it down in the hallway, since it is such a high traffic area and it<br/>\n<br/>\nwas starting to get stains.  The remnant is reallystained, has a cut out<br/>\n<br/>\npatch and is basically UGLY, but now I don&#39;t have to fret so much over that<br/>\n<br/>\narea of the house!  A victory!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -=-I just couldn&#39;t stand that clean and dirty clothes were left all<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; over the room, along with puzzle pieces-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We kept puzzles in public rooms, and they were worked on mom-cleaned<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; floorspace, or on a table, and admired when they were finished, and put<br/>\n<br/>\naway.  We<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; still have the baby puzzles Kirby and Marty did, because maintaining them<br/>\n<br/>\nwas a<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; priority.  We have some wooden tray puzzles and there is one piece missing<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; one, which has always baffled us.  It must&#39;ve falling in the trash the<br/>\n<br/>\nfirst<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; week we had it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; But the point is, puzzles can and maybe should be treated like valuable<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; things, not mixed with clothes and books and other puzzles.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, this is exactly how we treated puzzles in our old house in<br/>\n<br/>\nPortland.  They were in the playroom off the kitchen on a high shelf, and I<br/>\n<br/>\nhappily got them down for them to play and helped them put it away when they<br/>\n<br/>\nwere finished.  This house is sort of half finished and doesn&#39;t have alot of<br/>\n<br/>\nshelving.  Also, I&#39;ve been doing alot of reading on the unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\ndiscussion list, and I got the idea that maybe that was hampering their<br/>\n<br/>\nfreedom and creativity to keep things put away like that, so I have been<br/>\n<br/>\nplaying around with the idea of giving them full access to their things all<br/>\n<br/>\nthe time.  I  now think I need to wait until they are older and that what I<br/>\n<br/>\nwas doing before is better for us.  In fact, early this morning I talked to<br/>\n<br/>\nmy husband on the phone, and he asked me if there was anything I wanted him<br/>\n<br/>\nto bring out here when he comes this weekend.  I told him to please bring<br/>\n<br/>\nmaterials to build shelves out in the patio area.  He agreed that was a good<br/>\n<br/>\nidea and also said that he wants to work with me to get the patio area<br/>\n<br/>\ncleaned up and more usable!  I&#39;m very excited about this.  This will do so<br/>\n<br/>\nmuch to make things better here for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Holly bought a My Little Pony puzzle at a thrift store the other day, and<br/>\n<br/>\nit<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; was pretty wonderful that there were TWO in there.  Same artists, same<br/>\n<br/>\ncolors,<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; but I guess whoever gave it to the thrift store had lost or destroyed the<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; other box.  For her at 12, it was really extra fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids love finding puzzles at thrift stores and we also have on occasion<br/>\n<br/>\ngotten one with more than one puzzle in it.  Great fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Can library books have a cardboard box or a basket where they live, in a<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; public room?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, a couple of days ago, I &quot;reinstated&quot; the book box that we used at<br/>\n<br/>\nour old house (it is a big wicker box I got at a thrift store and was full<br/>\n<br/>\nof stuff from the move up until then), and it has already been helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny how happy THEY were to have it back!

People who know me well say I <br/>\nam a good mother and get frustrated when I tell them how bad I am at this, but <br/>\nI am just not satisfied at all, and they don&#39;t get to see me lose it either.  <br/>\nStill, I know that I need to keep striving even when I feel I have lapsed. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -=-Sarah is very helpful, actually, because she plays with the girls (3 <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; and 4 yo) so much, but I don&#39;t want to take advantage of her for the <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; very reasons you mention. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s another good reason to get an older child in.  It shouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nSarah&#39;s <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; sole job, and if you got friends a little older than she is to help, <br/>\nplaying <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; with the little girls would be new and different (and more fun for Sarah <br/>\ntoo).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to do this, but I truly cannot afford to, nor do I know anyone in <br/>\nthis remote small community yet.  Mostly retirees living full time here, as it <br/>\nis a vacation spot.  Sarah knows that she can go into her room or say no to the <br/>\ngirls anytime, and that I support her in that.  Just yesterday that came up <br/>\nwhen my 4 yo wouldn&#39;t leave her alone in her room.  I really don&#39;t ask much <br/>\nfrom her, but she is a generous big sister.  It is easy for me to help her when <br/>\nshe needs it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -=- When I ask her to help me <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; tidy her room for instance, she answers, &quot;No.  I&#39;m playing with <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Sarah&quot; in a really snotty voice.  This really ticks me off <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; sometimes. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; The &quot;snotty voice&quot; is sad, but how is your tone of voice when you ask her? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, this is part of why I&#39;m so frustrated.  I cannot think of a time <br/>\nthat I use an ugly voice or a demanding tone when I ask them for help the first <br/>\ntime.  I hear myself saying, &quot;Hey guys, lets pick up this room so we can do <br/>\nsomething else, or so you can find your things when you want to use them the <br/>\nnext time&quot; or whatever.  I try to be light and fun.  It works if there is <br/>\nsomething immediately in store for them when we finish, but not very often otherwise. <br/>\n I finally end up begging or yelling or something else, but it doesn&#39;t start <br/>\nthat way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; And if one of your problems is feeling too crowded and overwhelmed, maybe <br/>\nyou <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; should be glad of times when she&#39;s playing with someone else, and clean her <br/>\nroo<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; m yourself, in peace, breathing deeply.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am!  I truly am, but only when the baby isn&#39;t yelling, or Annie isn&#39;t <br/>\nneeding something.  But that is nice when I can just do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Please look at some of the things here.  It has made lots of lives easy to <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; reconsider &quot;chores&quot;:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/chores\">http://sandradodd.com/chores</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; (Most of that is other people&#39;s writing, not mine.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!  I will take a look.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -=-My natural tendency <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; is to nag them about taking care of their things, and to put <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; everything in it&#39;s place again.  :) -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes this teaches kids not to take things out.   Sometimes a mother <br/>\nwho <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; says ger kids are bored and don&#39;t want to do anything forget to mention <br/>\nthat <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; the cost of them doing something is a major cleanup, so they gave up.   If <br/>\nyou <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; see the art as a valuable part of their learning, maybe you should be <br/>\nwilling <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; to clean up after it entirely.  Part of the glory of unschooling is that we <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t end up with hours and hours of &quot;teacher duty,&quot; but maybe part of <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; unschooling for the parents should be recognition that there still is work <br/>\nto do to <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; provide the kids with &quot;a clean canvas&quot;  (someone used that phrase at <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; unschooling.com, I think,  and I love it).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI like that too, and that&#39;s actually what I&#39;m thinking of when I clean their <br/>\nstuff up for them, which I do very often.  I&#39;ve backed way off of always <br/>\nexpecting them (especially the little ones) to do more, but I just can&#39;t do it all. <br/>\n I appreciate what you are saying, though.  I think that much of this I know, <br/>\nbut am having trouble implementing in our home.  Do you understand what I <br/>\nmean?  I guess I have to just keeping reading and keep trying to change how I <br/>\nfeel about and react to these issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much for your insight and help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185471567,"authorName":"Andrea","from":"&quot;Andrea&quot; &lt;aburlingame@...&gt;","profile":"raineeday66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Advice, please...(I think)","postDate":"1085768570","msgId":94825,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5ODAxcSszMzFzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMWEwMWM0NDRiYSRhNGVhZTVjMCQwOWJkYjFkOEB5b3VybzBrd2t3OWp3Yz4="},"prevInTopic":94823,"nextInTopic":94826,"prevInTime":94824,"nextInTime":94826,"topicId":94798,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

In any case, I&#39;m Andrea<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I&#39;ve just moved from Portland, OR to Ocean Park, WA.  I&#39;m re-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; married and we have 3 young children, Stella-age 4, Annie-age 3 <br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Evan almost 1, in addition to my 15 yo son, John, who lives with <br/>\nhis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; father in Alaska.  While I think that I do many things right by <br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children, I&#39;m just not satisfied.  I&#39;m actually very frustrated <br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; both myself and even my children.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been reading this list because I believe in the unschooling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; philosophy, even though some of the ideas are difficult for me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; While I realize that I need to let go of my need to control <br/>\nthings<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so that the kids have more freedom to learn, I&#39;m having a very <br/>\nhard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time doing that.  Here is just one problem I am having:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t consider myself a &quot;neat freak&quot; by any stretch of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; imagination, but I am ultimately bothered by clutter(can&#39;t relax <br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it after so many hours) and I do care about taking care of <br/>\nthings,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; especially since we truly don&#39;t have the money to replace things.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m very bothered when my kids (including my 10 year old<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stepdaughter) take out the art supplies or some other game or <br/>\npuzzle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and then when they are ready to do something else, just leave <br/>\nthem--<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on the table, the floor, their beds--wherever and often with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; caps off the markers, the puzzle pieces broken or lost or mixed <br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the other puzzles etc...  I&#39;ve tried just picking them all up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself, but that doesn&#39;t work.  With this many kids and noone to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; help me (my husband is working in Portland and we see him only on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weekends, IF he can make it being a contractor.), I find I truly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t keep up with it.  I&#39;ve even tried to just let go of my need<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for order, but there is also the problem of keeping the baby from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; eating these things.  It is a real hazard.  I also try <br/>\ndesignating a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; space for play with small things or art supplies, but they forget<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and sometimes, they just plain ignore me.  I wind up either <br/>\nyelling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at them or withholding some other treat in order to &quot;manipulate&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them into picking up after themselves.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We have other issues, too, that induce my yelling and I&#39;m so <br/>\nashamed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of this.  I feel I have an anger management problem that I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really realize the extent of until I had the combined stress of 3<br/>\n&gt; &gt; small children and really desperate finances.  I&#39;m reading Anger:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wisdom for Cooling the Flames by Thich Nhat Hanh and that&#39;s <br/>\nhelping<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some, because it truly speaks to so many areas of my life, but I <br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see that controlling my emotions and what I say is so hard for <br/>\nme.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My mom was a screamer, especially after my parents divorced and <br/>\nshe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was on her own with 4 kids, so I know where I learned it, though,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; perhaps it&#39;s just my nature.  In any case, I don&#39;t want to be <br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way with my children.  I&#39;m not sure what kind of advice I&#39;m <br/>\nasking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for, because there are so many things that I&#39;d like to work on.  <br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guess I wonder how do you meet the needs of your children while <br/>\nalso<br/>\n&gt; &gt; meeting your own.  I know you have to sacrifice some selfish <br/>\nneeds,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but I feel like I haven&#39;t even a brain cell to myself.  I want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enjoy this time with my little ones, but much of the time I just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t believe how hard this is.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Any suggestions?

I have found that the more we are out and<br/>\nabout, even just outside in the yard, the less mess in the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have ongoing problems about the household clutter.  My kids tend to<br/>\nsimply drop whatever they are doing, wherever they are, when something else<br/>\ncrosses their mind.  That&#39;s fine, no problem.  But with 5 kids, it quickly<br/>\nbecomes chaos since I can&#39;t keep up with it and drive them where they want<br/>\nto go, help them with projects, cook, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\n No one can find what they are looking for, people complain of feeling<br/>\nclaustrophobic, etc..  The kids and I sat down and talked many, many times<br/>\nabout it.  They had got to where they began to resent me SEEMINGLY following<br/>\nthem around, asking them to do things to pick up.  Kids share a room and<br/>\nthey would fight over picking stuff up someone else left out after they had<br/>\njust straightened the room, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked and talked and talked and tried this and tried that.  We finally<br/>\nsettled on a system where each person in the family is responsible for a<br/>\nzone. The person is asked once per day to go through their &quot;zone&quot; and just<br/>\npick up the clutter.  It takes about 5 minutes and the kids don&#39;t feel like<br/>\nI am constantly asking them to do something.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have found the key is talking, reworking, trying to keep everyone happy,<br/>\ngoing for concensus, etc..  And it gets easier as the kids get older and can<br/>\ntake another person&#39;s point of view easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have carved out a couple of niches per day of time for me.

In any case, I&#39;m Andrea<br/>\n&gt; and I&#39;ve just moved from Portland, OR to Ocean Park, WA.  I&#39;m re-<br/>\n&gt; married and we have 3 young children, Stella-age 4, Annie-age 3 and<br/>\n&gt; Evan almost 1, in addition to my 15 yo son, John, who lives with his<br/>\n&gt; father in Alaska.  While I think that I do many things right by my<br/>\n&gt; children, I&#39;m just not satisfied.  I&#39;m actually very frustrated at<br/>\n&gt; both myself and even my children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading this list because I believe in the unschooling<br/>\n&gt; philosophy, even though some of the ideas are difficult for me.<br/>\n&gt; While I realize that I need to let go of my need to control things<br/>\n&gt; so that the kids have more freedom to learn, I&#39;m having a very hard<br/>\n&gt; time doing that.  Here is just one problem I am having:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t consider myself a &quot;neat freak&quot; by any stretch of the<br/>\n&gt; imagination, but I am ultimately bothered by clutter(can&#39;t relax in<br/>\n&gt; it after so many hours) and I do care about taking care of things,<br/>\n&gt; especially since we truly don&#39;t have the money to replace things.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m very bothered when my kids (including my 10 year old<br/>\n&gt; stepdaughter) take out the art supplies or some other game or puzzle<br/>\n&gt; and then when they are ready to do something else, just leave them--<br/>\n&gt; on the table, the floor, their beds--wherever and often with the<br/>\n&gt; caps off the markers, the puzzle pieces broken or lost or mixed with<br/>\n&gt; the other puzzles etc...  I&#39;ve tried just picking them all up<br/>\n&gt; myself, but that doesn&#39;t work.  With this many kids and noone to<br/>\n&gt; help me (my husband is working in Portland and we see him only on<br/>\n&gt; weekends, IF he can make it being a contractor.), I find I truly<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t keep up with it.  I&#39;ve even tried to just let go of my need<br/>\n&gt; for order, but there is also the problem of keeping the baby from<br/>\n&gt; eating these things.  It is a real hazard.  I also try designating a<br/>\n&gt; space for play with small things or art supplies, but they forget<br/>\n&gt; and sometimes, they just plain ignore me.  I wind up either yelling<br/>\n&gt; at them or withholding some other treat in order to &quot;manipulate&quot;<br/>\n&gt; them into picking up after themselves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have other issues, too, that induce my yelling and I&#39;m so ashamed<br/>\n&gt; of this.  I feel I have an anger management problem that I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really realize the extent of until I had the combined stress of 3<br/>\n&gt; small children and really desperate finances.  I&#39;m reading Anger:<br/>\n&gt; Wisdom for Cooling the Flames by Thich Nhat Hanh and that&#39;s helping<br/>\n&gt; some, because it truly speaks to so many areas of my life, but I can<br/>\n&gt; see that controlling my emotions and what I say is so hard for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My mom was a screamer, especially after my parents divorced and she<br/>\n&gt; was on her own with 4 kids, so I know where I learned it, though,<br/>\n&gt; perhaps it&#39;s just my nature.  In any case, I don&#39;t want to be that<br/>\n&gt; way with my children.  I&#39;m not sure what kind of advice I&#39;m asking<br/>\n&gt; for, because there are so many things that I&#39;d like to work on.  I<br/>\n&gt; guess I wonder how do you meet the needs of your children while also<br/>\n&gt; meeting your own.  I know you have to sacrifice some selfish needs,<br/>\n&gt; but I feel like I haven&#39;t even a brain cell to myself.  I want to<br/>\n&gt; enjoy this time with my little ones, but much of the time I just<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t believe how hard this is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any suggestions?

One thing that I do when I want to<br/>\nyell is hug Jayn or blow a zerbil (raspberry) onto her instead. We then end<br/>\nup giggling, and the problem tends to become a lot smaller.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you could try getting some occasional help in tidying from an<br/>\noutside source - a mother&#39;s helper, a local teen intermittently, or perhaps<br/>\nyou could actually employ your daughter for a specific task for a specific<br/>\ntime frame. I would suggest that this be outside of any allowance that she<br/>\nalready receives. I think it could be tough for her to be seen as the<br/>\n&quot;mature&quot; child, and expected to take on caretaking of the other children or<br/>\ntheir messes - after all she had no choice in the matter of acquiring<br/>\nsiblings presumably.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that some folks use is to spread out a large groundsheet on which<br/>\nto do art work or puzzles. It can be a quick tidy to pick up the four<br/>\ncorners and presto, at least the appearance of tidy. This assumes that the<br/>\nchildren are done with the project and don&#39;t mind it getting put aside in a<br/>\nhiggledy piggledy manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than trying to baby proof the whole house or restrict the older ones<br/>\nin their activities to one place, perhaps you can make a &quot;safe room&quot; or<br/>\nfenced off area for the baby to be mobile and free in. Perhaps this place<br/>\ncould become a sanctuary place for all members of the family with large soft<br/>\npillows and no hard edges.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of things on their beds - I would try the idea of picking my<br/>\nbattles initially - obviously the long term idea is to not have any battles.<br/>\nTheir rooms should be their rooms, and not held to the same standard as the<br/>\npublic or shared areas of the house. (Perhaps they are all in your room?<br/>\nStill that is not the same place where you entertain a visitor for example.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you have recently moved, you may not have yet joined up with your<br/>\nlocal homeschool group. I suggest doing so as soon as possible, if for no<br/>\nother reason than some adult conversations to help restore the brain cells.<br/>\nMore importantly you won&#39;t feel as alone as you evidently do.

My middle son was a terror, and I had no idea what to do with him :)<br/>\nAnd I had a husband coming home each night.  There were a few days I met him at the door with my car keys, and just took a drive when he got home.  I only went for a short time, maybe half and hour, but as you probably know well, even that can help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too care about our belongings (furniture, house)  We have a some gorgeous furniture from my parents, and an equally beautiful house.<br/>\nThe kids have always been taught to be respectful of the things we have, but when accidents happen, they are just that....accidents.  Some things we put in the attic when the kids were younger.  Some we haven&#39;t even brought out yet!  But, mostly we try to balance it all.<br/>\nI do talk to them about picking up and putting away after themselves.  With five of us in the house, if we didn&#39;t do that, we would be knee deep in stuff, and we wouldn&#39;t be able to find anything.  I personally can&#39;t live that way either.<br/>\nHaving said all that, we have art supplies all over our kitchen counter, that keep blowing on the floor from the open widows.  We also have art supplies on a table in the living room where my daughter has been painting.  The kitchen itself is a mess from dinner...bad me!  But I&#39;ll get to it in the morning.  lol<br/>\nThe kids rooms are in various states at different times..  Sometimes a complete disaster while they are busy with something...like creating lego vehicles, and when that phase is over, then we go through getting reorganized.  They don&#39;t like the picking up, but they do love it when their rooms are organized where they find things again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is a balance you have to find.  Some mess, some sanity.  Forgive yourself more...this is a hard time.  But remember that ultimately the kids are the most important.  Climbing into a hugely messy bed together and reading books will be much more satisfying if you allow it to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember that explaining instead of yelling usually works better.  Kids like to be helpful to their Mommies.  They can be great helpers if you explain how important they are to you and what you are doing at the time. And mean it...don&#39;t just make it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do have an anger management problem, then kudos to you for accepting that and looking for help.  It is hard to unlearn coping techniques that we learn from our parents, but you can make better choices.  If you do lose your temper, you can apologize!  We are all human, and we all try our best.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does get easier as they get older, but do try to enjoy the small ages.<br/>\nThere are wonderful cuddly times...take advantage of all of them!<br/>\nAnn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140747339,"authorName":"Jennifer Altenbach","from":"&quot;Jennifer Altenbach&quot; &lt;salten@...&gt;","profile":"brownaltenbach","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Advice, please...(I think)","postDate":"1085714986","msgId":94799,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTEwMWM0NDQ2NCQwNjk0YTYwMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBqZW5sYXB0b3A+","inReplyToHeader":"PGM5NjVoYyt1YjdyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":94798,"nextInTopic":94802,"prevInTime":94798,"nextInTime":94800,"topicId":94798,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Andrea, I think you could benefit greatly from this group: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PositiveParenting-Discipline/ It is not an unschooling group, although","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1067306692\">Andrea,<br/>\nI think you could benefit greatly from this group:<br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PositiveParenting-Discipline/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PositiveParenting-Discipline/</a><br/>\n <br/>\nIt is not an unschooling group, although there are some unschoolers<br/>\nthere, and some school at homers, and school people, but they all share<br/>\nthe same desire to communicate better with their kids and practice<br/>\npositive discipline skills.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou could post this same message there and get some great feedback.<br/>\n <br/>\nNot that you won&#39;t get it here either, it&#39;s just that the PP-D group<br/>\nfocuses specifically on this topic.<br/>\n <br/>\nCheck it out!

Here is just one problem I am having:<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t consider myself a &quot;neat freak&quot; by any stretch of the <br/>\nimagination, but I am ultimately bothered by clutter(can&#39;t relax in <br/>\nit after so many hours) and I do care about taking care of things, <br/>\nespecially since we truly don&#39;t have the money to replace things.  <br/>\nI&#39;m very bothered when my kids (including my 10 year old <br/>\nstepdaughter) take out the art supplies or some other game or puzzle <br/>\nand then when they are ready to do something else, just leave them--<br/>\non the table, the floor, their beds--wherever and often with the <br/>\ncaps off the markers, the puzzle pieces broken or lost or mixed with <br/>\nthe other puzzles etc...  I&#39;ve tried just picking them all up <br/>\nmyself, but that doesn&#39;t work.  With this many kids and noone to <br/>\nhelp me (my husband is working in Portland and we see him only on <br/>\nweekends, IF he can make it being a contractor.), I find I truly <br/>\ncan&#39;t keep up with it.  I&#39;ve even tried to just let go of my need <br/>\nfor order, but there is also the problem of keeping the baby from <br/>\neating these things.  It is a real hazard.  I also try designating a <br/>\nspace for play with small things or art supplies, but they forget <br/>\nand sometimes, they just plain ignore me.  I wind up either yelling <br/>\nat them or withholding some other treat in order to &quot;manipulate&quot; <br/>\nthem into picking up after themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have other issues, too, that induce my yelling and I&#39;m so ashamed <br/>\nof this.  I feel I have an anger management problem that I didn&#39;t <br/>\nreally realize the extent of until I had the combined stress of 3 <br/>\nsmall children and really desperate finances.  I&#39;m reading Anger:  <br/>\nWisdom for Cooling the Flames by Thich Nhat Hanh and that&#39;s helping <br/>\nsome, because it truly speaks to so many areas of my life, but I can <br/>\nsee that controlling my emotions and what I say is so hard for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom was a screamer, especially after my parents divorced and she <br/>\nwas on her own with 4 kids, so I know where I learned it, though, <br/>\nperhaps it&#39;s just my nature.  In any case, I don&#39;t want to be that <br/>\nway with my children.  I&#39;m not sure what kind of advice I&#39;m asking <br/>\nfor, because there are so many things that I&#39;d like to work on.  I <br/>\nguess I wonder how do you meet the needs of your children while also <br/>\nmeeting your own.  I know you have to sacrifice some selfish needs, <br/>\nbut I feel like I haven&#39;t even a brain cell to myself.  I want to <br/>\nenjoy this time with my little ones, but much of the time I just <br/>\ncan&#39;t believe how hard this is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?  Please don&#39;t berate me too badly for yelling.  I&#39;m <br/>\nhard enough on myself and am coming here for help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
