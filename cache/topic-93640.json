Even if you&#39;re not going to <br/>\nconferences, you may be interested in this for other possible vacation spots.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am IN NO WAY affiliated with the company that produces the Entertainment books <br/>\nand I stand to gain nothing by this endorsement.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I purchased Entertainment books (offer a large selection of 2-for-1 <br/>\ndiscount coupons) for Kansas City and Boston recently.  They are normally around <br/>\n$30-$40.  They are currently $9.99, plus $5 for each book for shipping.  We plan on <br/>\nspending some time in KC and Boston after the conferences.  I just received them <br/>\nyesterday and know that we will MORE than make up the $15 price for each, just in <br/>\npizza and fast food coupons, let alone museum discounts.  The coupons expire on <br/>\nNov. 1, 2004.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can go to www.entertainment.com and look at the coupons each book offers.  <br/>\nYou can purchase for other cities there, too.  Right now, all of the books for any city <br/>\nare $9.99.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe plan on using whatever coupons we can while in the cities, then passing the <br/>\nbooks on to someone there, or perhaps leave them in the hotel lobby.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmey Park</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93583,"nextTopicId":93467}}
