He is the son of Italian <br/>\nimmigrants, and he didn&#39;t read at all when he was growing up in the <br/>\nFordham section of the Bronx. Instead, he was obsessed with games: <br/>\ncard games, alley games, rooftop games, fire escape games, punch <br/>\nball, stick ball, handball, or stoopball.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when he was 18, he got a summer job as a playground attendant. <br/>\nHe was supposed to patrol the park and blow a whistle if he saw <br/>\nanything out of order, but instead he began to spend every day <br/>\nsitting on a park bench reading books he got out of the library. He <br/>\nread Melville, Hemingway, Faulkner, and James Joyce, and he <br/>\nsaid, &quot;It was through [those books] that I learned to see something <br/>\nin language that carried a radiance, something that made me feel the <br/>\nbeauty and fervor of words, the sense that a word has a life and a <br/>\nhistory.&quot;***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s never too late and I&#39;m sure all those wonderful games helped <br/>\nprepare his mind for his thinking and writing. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly<br/>\n2 COOL 4 SCHOOL<br/>\nUnschooling t-shirts and more!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/2cool4school\">http://www.cafepress.com/2cool4school</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110027,"nextTopicId":110103}}
