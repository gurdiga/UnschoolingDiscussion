I nursed both for so long, and never had a good pump. <br/>\nUntil Wednesday evening at karate, I always thought I just couldn&#39;t pump. The <br/>\nKarate instructor&#39;s wife was sitting with me and we were chatting away about <br/>\nher new baby. (who is the most beautiful baby!) We were talking about how <br/>\nlong we had nursed our children and I mentioned that the only drawback I ever <br/>\nhad was I couldn&#39;t be away from the kids for too long, because neither of the <br/>\npumps I had ever worked well. She told me something I never knew. She said <br/>\nthat the pumps you buy at the store are made by formula companies. I am sure <br/>\nall you know that, but I never did. And I am mad! She said if I ever have <br/>\nanother baby I need to get a pump from a reputable company, and apparently <br/>\nthey are expensive. But I am just mad, so mad. Do you all see how mad I am? <br/>\nWhy are formula companies making breast pumps? How fair is that? So many <br/>\nwomen, discouraged at the 1/2 oz. of milk produced after 15 minutes of <br/>\npumping! So many women who just quit out of frustration!  So, if you know a <br/>\nwoman who is about to have a baby, and she is going to breast-feed her baby, <br/>\nhelp her get a really good pump!
