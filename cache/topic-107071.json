I had one <br/>\nsimilar to this (Roya) and it was the same way - just go go go always <br/>\nto the point of total mental and physical exhaustion and then trying <br/>\nstill to keep going. They get very frantic.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I&#39;m so glad to know you:-)  With your experience with Roya, it&#39;s helped me tremendously to share experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The number one best thing that worked to help Roya calm down enough to <br/>\nfall asleep was a LOT of exercise during the day - &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, this is when she settles in best at night.  When she has had a very &quot;active&quot; day.  I&#39;m working on doing that more regularly.  The baby and I are sick with a bad cold again.  We both have fevers.  I hate this because then I can&#39;t get her out and she *needs* that.  I do open up the backyard and let her &quot;run.&quot;  She tells me it&#39;s too hot for her to be out there lately, though.  I do have a secret weapon, though when I&#39;m really desperate to get her excercise.  We have a bounce house that I set up on occasion and she bounces inside of it inside the house, lol.  It takes up the whole playroom when it is up, but it&#39;s been a lifesaver at times for energy burn off when we haven&#39;t been able to get out.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Karri - you&#39;re going to have to find a way to convince your husband <br/>\nthat it is WORTH it to have the tv sound down - if it is on softly, <br/>\nthat&#39;ll be fine, background noise won&#39;t keep her awake, it is sudden <br/>\nloud sounds that will get her riled up.  If he understood that finding a bedtime routine that worked to settle <br/>\nher down would mean a far less frantic and more enjoyable evening for <br/>\nhim, too, he&#39;d be more likely to cooperate, don&#39;t you think?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I actually told him what you said and he agreed to get a pair of headphones.  I&#39;ve known that the sound has bothered Lindsay for a long time and he is starting to get it, by other people saying so.  We bought the headphones and he just needs to set them up now;-)  They are wireless.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;He thought I should be able to just put her in another room, <br/>\nin a bed, and say, &quot;Stay there and go to sleep,&quot; and that was that.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, Jim would like it to be this way too.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When Roxana was a baby, I&#39;d sit on the couch to nurse her and call Roya <br/>\nto come and keep me company. I&#39;d ask her to sing me a song, tell me a <br/>\nstory, etc. Then I might ask her to put on a story tape and come <br/>\nsnuggle up with me. Or we&#39;d put on tv, but on something sweet and soft <br/>\n(David the Gnome!!! Anybody else remember him?). The best tv would be a <br/>\nvideo that we&#39;d already watched lots.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea to have her sing me a song. She&#39;d like that.  She does come snuggle with me and we do put her &quot;shows&quot; on that she likes (Reading Rainbow and Scooby Doo).<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So - a practical idea for you, Karri. A little tv for Lindsay to watch, <br/>\nwith headphones even -- a dvd/tv combo - you can get one for under a <br/>\nhundred dollars, I&#39;m sure. And get some dvd&#39;s that are going to work <br/>\nwell for her to fall asleep by.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat idea, I&#39;ll look into it.  As long as it is under 100 we can probably swing it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for sharing your suggestions and experience, Pam:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Karri<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKarri, Lindsay (4/16/02) and Camden (6/8/04)<br/>\n <br/>\nI like to concentrate on my blessings, not my disappointments. -Dee Johnson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Sell on Yahoo!

I had one <br/>\nsimilar to this (Roya) and it was the same way - just go go go always <br/>\nto the point of total mental and physical exhaustion and then trying <br/>\nstill to keep going. They get very frantic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe number one best thing that worked to help Roya calm down enough to <br/>\nfall asleep was a LOT of exercise during the day - like hours and hours <br/>\nof swimming or being at the beach, for example, then, after a good <br/>\ndinner, a warm bath and putting on soft comfy pajamas. Timing was <br/>\ncrucial. If I let her get too overtired, nothing would work and she&#39;d <br/>\nfinally have a meltdown and neither of us would get to sleep until we <br/>\nwere MORE than exhausted. But, a warm bath at the right time and then <br/>\nsoft pajamas and then I&#39;d talk her into snuggling - I&#39;d read to her, <br/>\nsomething soft and not too exciting. And I&#39;d read slowly and softly. <br/>\nAnd I would take slow breaths and she&#39;d often just start breathing more <br/>\nslowly along with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarri - you&#39;re going to have to find a way to convince your husband <br/>\nthat it is WORTH it to have the tv sound down - if it is on softly, <br/>\nthat&#39;ll be fine, background noise won&#39;t keep her awake, it is sudden <br/>\nloud sounds that will get her riled up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he understood that finding a bedtime routine that worked to settle <br/>\nher down would mean a far less frantic and more enjoyable evening for <br/>\nhim, too, he&#39;d be more likely to cooperate, don&#39;t you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nI had the same kind of problem with my husband - I&#39;d be sitting in the <br/>\nliving room, have FINALLY gotten Roya started settling down, I could <br/>\ntell she was winding down, but he&#39;d switch channels to a really loud <br/>\nchannel, or go into the kitchen (which is right there - small house) <br/>\nand run the trash compactor, or even just start whistling or something <br/>\nthat would get her ears perked up. I was just so much more in tune with <br/>\nwhat was needed in our environment to help her calm down and get ready <br/>\nto sleep. He thought I should be able to just put her in another room, <br/>\nin a bed, and say, &quot;Stay there and go to sleep,&quot; and that was that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, when the kids were older - when Roxana was 3 1/2 and Roya <br/>\nwas 6 1/2, we DID have a time that we just called &quot;quiet time.&quot; I had <br/>\nanother baby by then and was very worn out and desperately needed that <br/>\ntime AND they were very willing - they LIKED it. Turns out that&#39;s when <br/>\nRoxana learned to read - during those &quot;quiet times&quot; with her sister <br/>\nwhen she was, apparently, constantly asking Roya, &quot;What does this <br/>\nspell? What is this word?&quot; We made that &quot;quiet time&quot; nice for them - <br/>\nthey&#39;d pick out baskets of books and small toys to take into their <br/>\nbeds, so that they would have them at hand, and they&#39;d have warm milk <br/>\nfirst (which I always thought was just disgusting but my husband got <br/>\nthem started and they liked it) and we&#39;d put soft music on a tape <br/>\nplayer and so on. I didn&#39;t read aloud then - because I was never good <br/>\nat reading aloud at night, I was too tired all the time. They looked <br/>\nforward to it. Nobody ever told them to go to sleep - and they could <br/>\nhave come out, occasionally did, but really not often. Mostly they just <br/>\nset their stuff aside and turned over and went to sleep in a half hour <br/>\nor an hour or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Roxana was a baby, I&#39;d sit on the couch to nurse her and call Roya <br/>\nto come and keep me company. I&#39;d ask her to sing me a song, tell me a <br/>\nstory, etc. Then I might ask her to put on a story tape and come <br/>\nsnuggle up with me. Or we&#39;d put on tv, but on something sweet and soft <br/>\n(David the Gnome!!! Anybody else remember him?). The best tv would be a <br/>\nvideo that we&#39;d already watched lots.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - a practical idea for you, Karri. A little tv for Lindsay to watch, <br/>\nwith headphones even -- a dvd/tv combo - you can get one for under a <br/>\nhundred dollars, I&#39;m sure.

If we all go to bed, she goes because she does not want to be alone.  She is always told that she does not have to go to bed.  The thing is that I also need to have some alone time (let alone time with DH) and I usually take it after everyone is asleep.

Sometimes the older two are watching TV or<br/>\ndoing something else on their own. Occasionally, the 3yo, who doesn&#39;t<br/>\nusually take naps except in the car, goes to sleep while watching TV or<br/>\nshe&#39;ll just go into the bedroom and before I know it she&#39;s asleep. I read at<br/>\nnight as well, if it works (sometimes the 1-year-old will be too grabby with<br/>\nthe book). Oftentimes I&#39;m nursing him while I read. Sometimes the kids ask<br/>\nfor a story with no book. The 3yo invariably wants &quot;Goldilocks,&quot; complete<br/>\nwith goofy voices, but the older children like family stories about my<br/>\nchildhood or their babyhoods or dh&#39;s and my courtship. I think it&#39;s hard on<br/>\n3yos when they see the littlest one getting exclusive mommy attention. My<br/>\nhusband does very well with the kids, but the little ones have always seemed<br/>\nto need *me* during bedtime. It has made things easier (and I think is<br/>\nkinder) to just go with that. It helps the 3yo to fall asleep in my bed.<br/>\nThen, I move her in with the 9yo, who is in a double bed in the same room,<br/>\nbecause she moves around a lot and wakes up the baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that the way the culture presents children going to bed is just<br/>\nunrealistic. You know, mom puts the kid in bed, reads a story and says,<br/>\n&quot;Good night,&quot; and then turns off the life and leaves. All my kids really<br/>\nlike my presence while they&#39;re going to bed. Esp. when they&#39;re toddlers. The<br/>\nolder ones will say they&#39;re tired and can go off and go to sleep on their<br/>\nown, but they prefer it if I come in with them for at least a bit. And I<br/>\nusually do it. I think it&#39;s a nice way to connect with them, esp. as they&#39;ve<br/>\ngotten older and are doing more running around in the neighborhood and the<br/>\noldest goes to camps and activities without me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re also in a not-ideal housing situation right now. My landlady lives<br/>\nnext door, separate from us only by some drywall. She gets up around 5 for<br/>\nwork, and she has complained about toddler feet running around. (Yes, we are<br/>\ngetting out of this situation.) Because of this, though, our house has<br/>\n&quot;quiet hours&quot; like a college dorm or something. I&#39;m not thrilled about the<br/>\nsituation, but it&#39;s something we have to deal with right now. There have<br/>\nbeen some good things about it, however. I&#39;m just not the &quot;schedule&quot; type,<br/>\nbut the routine has been comforting for the 3yo in particular.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t fight over bedtime. Things I&#39;ve done to help get them ready for bed<br/>\nis make sure that they do get a lot of active play during the day. The 3yo<br/>\nreally does better we&#39;ve gone on walks or to the park and she&#39;s gotten some<br/>\ntime to run around.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there were other issues involving your dh, but I wanted to focus on<br/>\nthe things that seemed more in your control. :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen<br/>\nin LA</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223130287,"authorName":"Krisula Moyer","from":"&quot;Krisula Moyer&quot; &lt;krisula@...&gt;","profile":"krisulaula","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: helping little kids get in the mood for bedtime and other advice (long)","postDate":"1120158275","msgId":107082,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNjMwMTkwNC5qNVVKNFpGZjAwOTA2OUBtcy1zbXRwLTAxLWVyaTAuc29jYWwucnIuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMjAxMjUyNDEuMTI3LjgwMjYzLm0xN0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107081,"nextInTopic":107086,"prevInTime":107081,"nextInTime":107083,"topicId":107071,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Karri, I wonder if you could get a set of headphones for dh to use that might help keep things quiet during the going to sleep time.

If he would agree to shut<br/>\noff lights and come to kiss Lindsey goodnight then it would seem to her as<br/>\nif everything is dark and winding down.  Then he could return to the TV<br/>\nusing headphones in the other room.  It&#39;s not an answer for the deeper<br/>\nissues, but maybe just addressing the noise issue first would help you all<br/>\nget past the harried frustrating part and clear your head to think of more<br/>\nsolutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I just thought of something we used to do with Trayton when he was<br/>\nsleepy.  Dark, quiet, lying next to him, I would ask him to put his head on<br/>\nthe pillow and then I would breath long, slow, audible breaths next to him.<br/>\nHe would eventually slow his breathing to match mine and fall asleep.  Anika<br/>\nand Sydney both drop off when I read chapter books (preferably without<br/>\npictures).  And one last thing.  I used to always try to help Sydney go to<br/>\nbed while Anika was nursing.  When it looked like she was going to be hungry<br/>\nin the evening, I&#39;d turn off all the lights in the house and retreat to a<br/>\nquiet spot (her bed or mine or the couch ) and do the aforementioned<br/>\nroutines.  That way the baby was sure to be quiet.  A lot of the time I fell<br/>\nasleep with them. (modeling?)  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo much for evening couple time.

My 3-year-old is very spirited.  Let me first say that<br/>\nI truly believe in abiding by the natural rhythms of my children.  I&#39;m<br/>\nfinding it hard to balance this at night when my dd is cranky, but refusing<br/>\nto go to bed when she&#39;s tired.  I have tried in the past to get her to bed<br/>\nand she just won&#39;t sleep. She continually pops up and won&#39;t stay in the bed.<br/>\nShe says that she wants mommy or daddy with her.  If we do lay down with her<br/>\nat the earlier time, she tosses and turns and won&#39;t sleep even though she is<br/>\nvery tired.  This is hard because I only have so long with her to lay down<br/>\nbecause I have to go to DS too.  So we usually just have her come out and<br/>\nlay on the couch where daddy is watching very loud tv and of course she<br/>\nwon&#39;t go to sleep, even though we can see that she is exhausted.  The<br/>\nproblem is that DH refuses to lie down with her in the family bed at an<br/>\n&quot;early&quot;  (to him) time because he doesn&#39;t want to fall asleep and he wants<br/>\nto stay up later.  I wish  that I could just have her play quietly in her<br/>\nroom, but she is afraid to be alone in there. I feel torn too because I have<br/>\na very awake 1 year-old to take care of as well.  He too only wants mommy at<br/>\nnight.  DH hates to have him crying in his ear when I go lay down with<br/>\nLindsay.  Also, DS is a night owl. Is there anyway to get them on the same<br/>\nsleep rhythm?  Or is DS just too young still?  And since they are two<br/>\ntotally different kids this probably will never happen, right?  We (dh and<br/>\nI) read stories to DD and try to promote calm, although I must say that DH<br/>\ncontinues to watch loud t.v. that effects all of us.  DH is unwilling to<br/>\nturn tv off to promote calm when we are trying to wind down.  The bedrooms<br/>\nin our house are very small so the rocking chair is in the playroom where<br/>\nour only tv is.  DD usually ends up going to bed with DH when she probably<br/>\nshould have went (because of tiredness) about two hours before.  I feel this<br/>\nis wrong and not respecting her body&#39;s needs because she  is obviously<br/>\ntired.  She has a tendency to wake up cranky in the morning too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also feel that we are at a loss for having any couple time to talk at<br/>\nnight and since we do the family bed also, we are never alone to talk.  On<br/>\ntop of it, at night we have a very tired DD screaming at us.  I know that<br/>\nthis will pass and is very fleeting.  I&#39;m just afraid this arrangement is<br/>\nnot working for us and is really taking its toll on our marriage.  I tend to<br/>\nget angry that DH won&#39;t help with the kids more and he&#39;s exhausted from<br/>\nworking all day (11 1/2 hrs) and doesn&#39;t really want to help.  When I do ask<br/>\nhim for help and he does it, he seems very resentful  We are BOTH just<br/>\nexhausted.  We do have my mom watch the kids on occasion so that we can have<br/>\ncouple time, but quite frankly this does not seem like enough time to have<br/>\ngood communication in our marriage.  Our marriage is definitely suffering<br/>\nand I don&#39;t know what to do about gaining more ways for us to find time for<br/>\neach other.  Any suggestions/advice would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKarri, Lindsay (4/16/02) and Camden (6/8/04)<br/>\n <br/>\nI like to concentrate on my blessings, not my disappointments. -Dee Johnson<br/>\n================================================</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201436708,"authorName":"arcarpenter2003","from":"&quot;arcarpenter2003&quot; &lt;arcarpenter@...&gt;","profile":"arcarpenter2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: helping little kids get in the mood for bedtime and other advice (long)","postDate":"1120150919","msgId":107081,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRhMThpNytxNDF0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRhMHBkaisyanZwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":107078,"nextInTopic":107082,"prevInTime":107080,"nextInTime":107082,"topicId":107071,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...  wrote: == I ...

My 3-year-old is very spirited.  Let me first say that I truly believe in abiding by the natural rhythms of my children.  I&#39;m finding it hard to balance this at night when my dd is cranky, but refusing to go to bed when she&#39;s tired.  I have tried in the past to get her to bed and she just won&#39;t sleep. She continually pops up and won&#39;t stay in the bed.  She says that she wants mommy or daddy with her.  If we do lay down with her at the earlier time, she tosses and turns and won&#39;t sleep even though she is very tired.  This is hard because I only have so long with her to lay down because I have to go to DS too.  So we usually just have her come out and lay on the couch where daddy is watching very loud tv and of course she won&#39;t go to sleep, even though we can see that she is exhausted.  The problem is that DH refuses to lie down with her in the family bed at an &quot;early&quot;  (to him) time because he doesn&#39;t want to fall asleep and he wants to stay up later.  I wish<br/>\n that I could just have her play quietly in her room, but she is afraid to be alone in there. I feel torn too because I have a very awake 1 year-old to take care of as well.
