Public schooling might be free, but once you graduate it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; whole different ballgame. There&#39;s money to be had, which is why<br/>\n&gt; colleges and universities hire headhunters, cherrypickers, fellows<br/>\n&gt; who scour the graduating classes for the best and the brightest,<br/>\n&gt; whose brains will bring scholarship monies (and prestige, which<br/>\n&gt; begets more money) to the school of higher education. It&#39;s Big<br/>\n&gt; Business at its crassest, and it&#39;s all built on a tenuous belief that<br/>\n&gt; without the degrees and certificates you won&#39;t be able to land a<br/>\n&gt; well-paying job in a good company.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And the kids get brainwashed all through school to believe they&#39;ll be<br/>\nnothing without finishing high school and getting a college degree.

In the 20+ years we&#39;ve been <br/>\npublishing Home Education Magazine we&#39;ve seen a subtle but important <br/>\nshift from thinking of education as just something that goes along <br/>\nwith whatever else one does in life, to thinking of education as a <br/>\nkind of one-way ticket to life itself. Let me rephrase that... I got <br/>\ndistracted and I&#39;m not sure the meaning will be clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I went to public school, in the &#39;50&#39;s and &#39;60&#39;s (yeah, I&#39;m an <br/>\nold geezer, gramma five times now), there was a delicious sense that <br/>\nwhat we were learning was more or less preparation for whatever we <br/>\ndecided to do with our lives after schooling ended. There was no <br/>\nsense that if you failed a class you might be failing something <br/>\nlarger - you simply retook the class until you figured it out. A <br/>\nniece of mine, a senior in high school this year, is practically <br/>\ngiving herself ulcers because she&#39;s struggling with an advanced math <br/>\nclass this year (trigonometry or something), and she&#39;s been told that <br/>\nif she doesn&#39;t pass that class she can&#39;t take a certain college <br/>\ncourse she needs to pursue her chosen career path. This one class is <br/>\njeopardizing the kid&#39;s entire future, so her math-whiz dad is <br/>\nbasically holding her hand all the way through the damn course. How <br/>\nmany kids like her face similar situations but don&#39;t have the backup <br/>\ndad handy?<br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere between the time I dropped out of school (actually, it was <br/>\nmore like kissed the nonsense goodbye) and what kids are faced with <br/>\nthese days there was a big slow change in what schools are about. <br/>\nThere&#39;s a strong sense that unless you get on the right educational <br/>\ntrack early you&#39;re going to miss out, and I think a lot of it has <br/>\nbeen driven by higher education - where the big bucks really hang <br/>\nout. Public schooling might be free, but once you graduate it&#39;s a <br/>\nwhole different ballgame. There&#39;s money to be had, which is why <br/>\ncolleges and universities hire headhunters, cherrypickers, fellows <br/>\nwho scour the graduating classes for the best and the brightest, <br/>\nwhose brains will bring scholarship monies (and prestige, which <br/>\nbegets more money) to the school of higher education. It&#39;s Big <br/>\nBusiness at its crassest, and it&#39;s all built on a tenuous belief that <br/>\nwithout the degrees and certificates you won&#39;t be able to land a <br/>\nwell-paying job in a good company.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember Michael J. Fox&#39;s old movie &quot;The Secret of My Success?&quot; The <br/>\nkid makes it to the top not because of his hard-earned papers and <br/>\ncertificates, but because he&#39;s sharper at people skills, takes <br/>\nadvantage of some ticklish opportunities, isn&#39;t afraid to buck the <br/>\nsystem and do things his own way, and of course his aunt owns the <br/>\noutfit - all that stuff they *didn&#39;t* teach in college. But there&#39;s a <br/>\nlot of truth in that silly little movie, too. Real life often works <br/>\nthat way - it&#39;s not what certificate you hold, but who you&#39;ve <br/>\nimpressed, what you&#39;ve accomplished, what kind of person you are that <br/>\npaves the way. My kids have learned the truth of that many times over <br/>\n- the older four who&#39;ve been out in the working world for many years <br/>\nnow have all referred to that movie and said &quot;Yep, just the attitude <br/>\nyou approach things with makes a big difference in what you&#39;ll be <br/>\nable to do...&quot; And they&#39;ve learned that there isn&#39;t much - from <br/>\nconstructing commercial buildings (two sons have been foremen on <br/>\nmajor commercial jobs) to long-haul trucking (one son&#39;s latest <br/>\ninterest - he been in 9 states in the last week) that can&#39;t be <br/>\nlearned on the job, just as I learned how to publish a magazine by <br/>\njust deciding to do it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I got lost again, and haven&#39;t really said what I wanted to <br/>\nhere about how educational interests are driving and shaping society <br/>\n- entire books have been written on that topic - but I&#39;m leaving for <br/>\nAlaska in the morning so I&#39;d better set this list to digest mode and <br/>\nget back to packing my bags. I&#39;ll be downloading the digests and <br/>\ncatching up on reading this list as I can, and once I&#39;m settled in up <br/>\nnorth I&#39;ll be back in the conversation again. This is still one of my <br/>\nfavorite lists to hang out on! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen<br/>\n--------------------------------<br/>\nHelen Hegener, Managing Editor<br/>\nHome Education Magazine<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM-Editor@...\">HEM-Editor@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n--------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1294635,"authorName":"Helen Hegener","from":"Helen Hegener &lt;HEM-Editor@...&gt;","profile":"hemhelen","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Early childhood learning","postDate":"1039371246","msgId":51009,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PHAwNTAwMTkwM2JhMTkzYzFjMTM2OUBbMjA4LjI2LjIzNS4xNzFdPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE2Zi4xODM1M2E0ZS4yYjI0Y2Q2N0Bhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE2Zi4xODM1M2E0ZS4yYjI0Y2Q2N0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51008,"nextInTopic":51010,"prevInTime":51008,"nextInTime":51010,"topicId":50996,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
