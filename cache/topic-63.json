Go to Homefires.com - this wonderful magazine has a list of many<br/>\nof the homeschool support groups in CA and also will give you some tips on R-4<br/>\n(however they do not give legal advice).   Before I started homeschooling I went<br/>\nto my local library and read the State Education Codes pertaining to educational<br/>\nrequirements in CA.   Homefires used to have a nice synopsis of the various ways<br/>\nto homeschool in CA and it listed the numbers of these Ed. Codes.  They are very<br/>\nboring to read, but they gave me the info I needed to know my rights.   I also<br/>\nread every homeschooling book I could get  my hands on.  My most valuable info<br/>\ncame from other homeschoolers I met at a local park day.   Hope you enjoy<br/>\nhomeschooling - have fun!  ~ Shannon - 4th yr homeschooling mom to 12dd and 9ds<br/>\n~<br/>\n<br/>\nChristine wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Christine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chris@...\">chris@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well... I figure I&#39;ll throw my intro in, since everyone is reading intros<br/>\n&gt; today :)  I&#39;m 27, single mother of two boys, ages 5 1/2 and 3 1/2, I work at<br/>\n&gt; home as a web designer and resell host provider.  I am informally<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling my boys right now, though I&#39;ll need to start some form of<br/>\n&gt; formal schooling at home for my oldest soon.  I live in Southern California,<br/>\n&gt; and here we can fill out an R-4 form, to homeschool.  I still have to find<br/>\n&gt; out more about that, but I have until october to register.  I&#39;d like to get<br/>\n&gt; involved with other homeschoolers, especially like the group that Summer is<br/>\n&gt; involved with.  That sounds wonderful!!  I&#39;m in the middle of a divorce, so<br/>\n&gt; things are a little tight here, but I hope to soon have my boys involved in<br/>\n&gt; some local classes (dance, acting, singing, martial arts, etc.).  Right now,<br/>\n&gt; I use a lot of books, computer programs the internet to homeschool my sons,<br/>\n&gt; which has been working out really well for us, so far.  Anyway.. I think<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s it for now.
