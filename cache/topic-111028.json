I have  <br/>\nsome newly-thought thoughts about it, but first I want to exhume and  <br/>\nput here something I wrote a long time back, and will post the other  <br/>\nin other places.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is here, too:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandadodd.com/dot/elvis\">http://sandadodd.com/dot/elvis</a><br/>\n(there&#39;s more at the website, and where it says &quot;back to the present&quot;  <br/>\nbelow it means back to the present when it was published years ago)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow Elvis Appears to Unschoolers<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce long ago, in 1993, on Prodigy&#39;s Homeschooling bulletin board, I  <br/>\nwrote this, and it conjured Elvis:<br/>\nSome time back there was a request for songs to be sung which would  <br/>\nbe educational. As music itself is a discipline, I think any music  <br/>\ncan be used as an educational tool. It can tie in with physical  <br/>\nactivity, mathematics, physics, history, geography, art, language,  <br/>\nand it can be used to get kids excited and awake, or calm and asleep,  <br/>\nor anything in between. I don&#39;t mean singing about math or history,  <br/>\neither, but discussing the form of the music, the rhythm, the moods,  <br/>\nthe origins, the instruments on which it is traditionally played, the  <br/>\nlength and pattern of the verses (or phrases, or whatever), what its  <br/>\npurpose is (a march, background music for a movie or for an 18th  <br/>\ncentury fireworks show, a lullaby, a love song), etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t miss this fun and easy opportunity to tie different &quot;subjects&quot;  <br/>\ntogether by using a song as a jumping off place to many different  <br/>\ndiscussions. If you need ideas, name a song here and see how many  <br/>\nsuggestions you can get for it!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that sat out in public for nearly two hours before someone wrote.  <br/>\n&quot;Ok, I&#39;ll try that. &#39;Blue Suede Shoes&#39;.&quot;<br/>\nI had never been an Elvis fan. Still, it was rich with potential. The  <br/>\nnext ten paragraphs here were the response:<br/>\n<br/>\nLook up pictures of the 50&#39;s. What was happening in those days? Where  <br/>\ndid Elvis Presley come from?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was the deal with Black music in those days? What was new that  <br/>\nbenefited Elvis&#39;s career? (Television! Cheap color movies!) How was  <br/>\nhis induction into the army (combined with his popularity) used by  <br/>\nthe government? Find some old magazines with articles showing him in  <br/>\nuniform, in his barracks, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is suede, anyway? How is it made? How far back in history was  <br/>\nthere suede? How is leather tanned? How would suede be made blue? How  <br/>\ndoes dye work? (Visit Tandy leather, or a shoe repair place. Tie-dye  <br/>\nsomething.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk about slang. Much of what was slang in the 50&#39;s is mainstream  <br/>\nEnglish now. What is slang that hasn&#39;t yet died out or been accepted  <br/>\nby a larger group?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;One for the money, two for the show, three to get ready and [go,  <br/>\ncat] go&quot;: With &quot;four to go,&quot; what is that used for outside this song?  <br/>\nIs it fair to just steal words from just anywhere for song lyrics?  <br/>\nSure it is! Look for some other examples. (It might take months of  <br/>\ncasual listening to find another example, but there are lots.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is &quot;slander&quot;? (Check &quot;libel&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the children are trained in music, you can talk about syncopation.  <br/>\nIf they&#39;re up on music technology, discuss the simple mixing that  <br/>\nwent on at recording studios in the 50&#39;s and early 60&#39;s, before  <br/>\nstereo was common (and before mono was no more). Listen to the  <br/>\nquality of the bass line and compare it to a modern recording with a  <br/>\nbroader spectrum and newer technology on storage and playback. Find  <br/>\nsomething that explains how magnetic tape works for sound recording  <br/>\nand CD&#39;s and phonograph records. (Usborne&#39;s music and science books  <br/>\nhave some stuff about this, and encyclopedias have too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat instrument did Elvis Presley play? Do you have a guitar at your  <br/>\nhouse, and could the kids learn a few chords? (Blue Suede Shoes can  <br/>\nbe played with four, I think, in a simplified form.) What other  <br/>\ninstruments are on the recording? What time signature is the song in?  <br/>\nWhat key? How could you find out? (pitch pipe, keyboard)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the difference between rock&#39;n&#39;roll and jazz? Blues? (This  <br/>\nmight be easier by identifying samples-i.e. multiple choice-than by  <br/>\ndefinition.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just the things I&#39;m thinking of as fast as I can type. Some  <br/>\nwould be too hard for some kids, some might not interest the parents  <br/>\nor kids, but every one could lead to something else, which could lead  <br/>\nto something else again. Looking through old Life or Look magazines  <br/>\nwould reveal lots of civil rights activity, the Korean War, the first  <br/>\ndays of Camp David, advertisements for modern gas appliances,  <br/>\ndiscussions of the new suburban homes (40-yr-old houses, shown as  <br/>\nbrand new cutting-edge technology), and advertisements for  <br/>\nautomobiles (with the prices, even in those days), and Elvis might be  <br/>\njust a tiny thought on the side of learning about the 50&#39;s. How did I  <br/>\ndo? Others should add more!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, back to the present now, I was amazed at how much had poured out.  <br/>\nThat led to my &quot;Everything is Educational&quot; belief which has turned  <br/>\ninto folders and workshops. Elvis had finally really captured my  <br/>\nattention.<br/>\nA few years later my kids asked about Hawaii and were amazed that I  <br/>\nwas already alive when Hawaii became a state and remembered reading  <br/>\nabout it in Weekly Reader at school. &quot;Tell us more.&quot; I thought of  <br/>\nElvis again, and went and rented &quot;Blue Hawaii.&quot; We ate pineapple. I  <br/>\nfound an umbrella I had bought at a thrift shop that was manufactured  <br/>\nin Hawaii before statehood. That started our &quot;unit&quot; on Hawaii, but as  <br/>\nI explained things to them ideas were coming together and being taken  <br/>\napart in my own mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; was new, Americans were seeing some of their first  <br/>\nBIG, color photos of Hawaii, and some of their first moving footage.  <br/>\nTV was still in black and white, and newspapers were too. Even most  <br/>\nmagazines were full of black and white photographs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about Germany, the Berlin Wall, prejudice, colonization,  <br/>\nplantations, volcanos, latitude, oceanography, music, fashion,  <br/>\nrealities in wealthy families which don&#39;t apply to poorer familes,  <br/>\ncultural traditions, the changing culture after WWII... We talked  <br/>\nabout commercial airlines, engineering and economics. We got more out  <br/>\nof a movie that was never intended (except for the tolerance and anti- <br/>\nprejudice messages) than I expected we would. And still I left things  <br/>\nout. The actress wasn&#39;t really half Hawaiian (I&#39;m guessing), but I  <br/>\nleft that for my kids to figure out later on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of what this sort of exploration takes is the willingness to let  <br/>\ngo of an &quot;outline&quot; or of a hope that you will find something, and an  <br/>\nability to go with what you do find. It&#39;s the big airplane hangar  <br/>\ndoor to unschooling, through which, if you can leave the schoolish  <br/>\nbuilding your own mind has built, which has &quot;academics&quot; sorted and  <br/>\nstacked against old walls with bad memories, you can see that light  <br/>\nof the real world outside. Just move out toward those cliffs and  <br/>\nflowers and see what kind of birds are out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo take up a glass of pineapple juice while &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; blares  <br/>\nin the background. Here&#39;s hoping you see Elvis soon!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n￼ ￼<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111148,"nextTopicId":111164}}
