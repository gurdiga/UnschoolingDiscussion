I ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-13134964\">I was thinking about Laura&#39;s question below...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a member of a lot of online communities, not just<br/>\nfor unschooling/homeschooling, but others as well. I<br/>\nmoderate one of those communities. Prior to someone<br/>\njoining there is usually a letter sent as to what the<br/>\nrules of etiquette are within any particular group.<br/>\nThere may have been one here as well, I just don&#39;t<br/>\nremember. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is, that I think respect is a big piece of<br/>\nwhat that should be. I haven&#39;t seen much respect here.<br/>\nI have left this group twice before for exactly the<br/>\nsame reasons. I don&#39;t really care who thinks they are<br/>\n&quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;.  What I seek is a community that<br/>\nallows us to voice our ideas in an environment that<br/>\noffers differing viewpoints, diversity of opinions,<br/>\nencouragement, and support. For *ALL* of us to feel at<br/>\nhome in such a community, we need to create an<br/>\nenvironment that treats each other with respect. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think an unschooling community such as this<br/>\nwould want a new member to think that there is just<br/>\n*ONE* way to do unschooling. Isn&#39;t that exactly what<br/>\nwe are hoping to avoid by unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the threads that suggest that we ignore the<br/>\nposts that are not respectful, is really just avoiding<br/>\nthe issue. Shouldn&#39;t we strive to have a community<br/>\nthat demands such from its members? Would our children<br/>\nbehave this way in such a community exchange? I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink so...<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the moderator can repost the rules of<br/>\netiquette here?
