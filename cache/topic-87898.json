Just last year someone <br/>\nsued to be eligible for the draft on the basis of age discrimination.  He <br/>\nlost his lawsuit.  He says there is no actual requirement that you EVER play <br/>\ncollege football, BUT... if you get out of high school a superstar, you&#39;re not <br/>\ngoing to sit around waiting for the magical age in two or three years in order to <br/>\nenter the NFL draft.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe says he thinks it&#39;s a good thing,  bodies need to mature, they&#39;d be killed <br/>\nin their first game, as in broken necks and backs... of course, he&#39;s a <br/>\nbaseball player, who could draft right out of high school.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut truthfully I can see there is more potential for injury in football than <br/>\nin basketball or baseball or some of the other sports.  But even if you are 22 <br/>\nor 32 football is still the same game right?<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79209,"nextTopicId":88041}}
