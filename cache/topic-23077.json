We keep digging more and more diseases out<br/>\nof places we would have never gone if we weren&#39;t so consumer-oriented.  And<br/>\nnature finds a way.  Humans are not all-powerful, and the Earth must find a<br/>\nway to control our population or we will surely suffocate her.<br/>\nDisease, famine, all that fun stuff is natural and needed.  I hope we never<br/>\nfind a cure for Cancer.  We caused cancer (at least the rampant kind), and<br/>\nit is needed to control our population.  As is all these other diseases.<br/>\nThey come in waves, people die, it isn&#39;t pretty, it makes us sad, but that<br/>\nis life.  And it makes our life better in the long run.<br/>\nAnd then you have things like the Flu shots... incredible stupidity right<br/>\nthere.  The mass use of this is only speeding up the evolution of super,<br/>\nvery lethal flus that will be immune to anything we throw at it.<br/>\nThe diseases will only get worse and more terrifying because we cannot<br/>\nescape our fate as humans.  I almost lost my daughter after she was born, I<br/>\ncould not even imagine what it would be like to have a child die.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>\na friend&#39;s child die and it was incredible how the mother was able to<br/>\nsurvive.  But death is a part of life, and if you are a part of any of the<br/>\nworld&#39;s religions this should not be such a terrifying thing.  And if you<br/>\nare not the spiritual type, then you probably can relate more to my<br/>\nmatter-of-fact views than others.<br/>\nTampering with nature is dangerous, we have learned that over and over and<br/>\nover again.  And yet we continue to destroy ourselves through attempting to<br/>\nclaim some victory over Nature, for the sake of convenience or tidyness or a<br/>\nlittle more money... and yet we all still empty inside like something is<br/>\nmissing even though we have the kids, the 2 story house full of stuff and 2<br/>\ncars (including a mini-van or SUV) in the garage.<br/>\nVaccines are only one small part of how we tamper with a very fragile<br/>\nsystem, and philosophically I despise it, and despise the society that<br/>\nguilts me into thinking I am not doing right for my children by the choices<br/>\nI make.  Perhaps I am faulty for caring for the people that must come after<br/>\nus, or the people on the other side of the globe.  But it pains me,<br/>\nphysically and truly, knowing what people do for themselves without caring,<br/>\nor even caring to know about what the repurcussions are.<br/>\n<br/>\nFalling off my soapbox... :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kristi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Connie Carlton [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:connie@...\">connie@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, August 09, 2001 5:53 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: vaccines and homeopathic remedies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI just read ONE of the CDC publications on the MMR vaccine--it contained a<br/>\nsummarization and statistic history of the diseases that are now under<br/>\ncontrol because of this vaccine<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00053391.htm)\">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00053391.htm)</a>.

There are a ton of<br/>\nothers to read as well.  The numbers of reported cases (and deaths,<br/>\nstillbirths, deformities, etc.) prior to the vaccine becoming available are<br/>\nfrightening!  It stated that with rubella alone, 85% of the children who<br/>\nwere born by mothers who contracted the disease during the first 8 weeks of<br/>\npregnancy were affected by the disease.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what figures some of you are using to justify the danger of<br/>\nvaccines... but 40,000 to 60,000 cases A YEAR of rubella alone were the norm<br/>\nbefore the vaccine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that in all things moderation and information is necessary, but<br/>\nexactly what kind of information is necessary to make this seem important?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a little about these CDC folks... these aren&#39;t people who went into<br/>\nmedicine to make a profit.  The researchers and statisticians who join the<br/>\nCDC are passionate about solving the world&#39;s diseases.  While some of these<br/>\nfolks might be described as bleeding heart liberals, at least they have<br/>\nhearts.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the homeopathic approach of giving a child camomilla??? I agree<br/>\nwith your warning about following that plan... Camomilla is one of the<br/>\nstrongest and most commonly known carcinogens.  Anyone that would give that<br/>\nin any substantive dose to a child is misinformed!<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bach2yoga@...\">bach2yoga@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bach2yoga@...\">bach2yoga@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, August 09, 2001 7:21 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: vaccines and homeopathic remedies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve found the info I mentioned.
