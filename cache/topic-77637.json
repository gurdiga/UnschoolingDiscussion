My name is Sheila and I <br/>\nhave homeschooled my dd 11 1/2 and ds 9 1/2 since birth.  I asked my <br/>\ndd and ds recently if they were excited to start school in <br/>\nSeptember.  He was and she said she wasn&#39;t.  That was it.  I knew <br/>\nafter much experience with trying every curriculum out there that I <br/>\nbetter start to deschool myself and allow both of them to unschool.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve been afraid because of the &quot;what should be done&quot; in my head <br/>\nroutine.  I&#39;m not anymore.  I read the Unschooling Handbook and found <br/>\nit my favorite homeschooling book ever.  I&#39;ve just finished reading <br/>\nReal-Life Homeschooling which consists of 21 different families.  <br/>\nThis book allowed me to find what my thoughts and philosophies always <br/>\nwere deep deep down.  Any story I read about the child unschooling I <br/>\nloved.  When I would read about the families that used a boxed <br/>\ncurriculum I myself would break out in a cold sweat knowing how it <br/>\nhas not worked here. (Could only imagine what my daughter thinks.) I <br/>\nsaid to my husband a couple of weeks ago, &quot;If I allowed her to <br/>\nunschool - she would soar!&quot;  My husband and I discussed it further <br/>\nand knew this is what we need to do.  I did not commit to this for my <br/>\nchildren (1) to hate learning and (2) butting heads with my dd on a <br/>\nday to day basis.  It seems to be that way lately and I feel down and <br/>\nout about it.  SO, HERE WE ARE!  I look forward to hearing how you <br/>\nLet Go and let them learn in freedom.  I intend to read, read read <br/>\nand keep my mouth shut in order to learn myself and let my kids learn <br/>\nin freedom.  Thanks for listening.  I plan on putting this on another <br/>\nloop I joined, so if you read it twice, I apologize - just looking to <br/>\nget good advice wherever I can!  Toodles.
