It is so<br/>\neasy to feel like we&#39;re being criticized because so many of us have had<br/>\nto deal with criticism from family and friends and sometimes spouses<br/>\nabout our choice to unschool.  When it seems like it comes at us from<br/>\neverywhere maybe we loose perspective some.<br/>\n<br/>\n ****What it does look like, from some, is the &quot;not in <br/>\nmy house never with my kids I always know exactly what to do and always<br/>\nhave <br/>\nattitude.&quot; ****<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this might be what it looks like to the people on the other side of<br/>\nthe discussion.  So many times we hear &quot;I know what&#39;s best for my kids&quot;<br/>\nand what the person is hiding behind is their excuse to spank, or shame<br/>\nor control their kids.

This really is the kind of<br/>\nthing that gets addressed on unschooling lists.  <br/>\n<br/>\n****Some have actually said, &quot;what I do when that happens is, or why <br/>\ndon&#39;t you try etc&quot; but for the most part, no solutions have been<br/>\nmentioned, <br/>\njust nit picking terms and words and some saying that what they are doing<br/>\nis <br/>\nwrong. ****<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really sorry if it feels like nit picking and not help.  The thing is<br/>\nsometimes people need to really think about what they are doing that<br/>\nmight be prompting certain behaviors in their kids.  That&#39;s not always<br/>\nthe case, but sometimes it is and it really can&#39;t hurt parents to think<br/>\nabout their parenting and how they could improve on what they&#39;re doing. <br/>\nNo, it&#39;s not the job of anyone on this list to tell anyone else how to<br/>\nparent, BUT if people come and ask a question on an unschooling list they<br/>\nare going to get unschooling responses.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would help to &quot;assume&quot; every post is meant in the most helpful<br/>\nway and not meant as a criticism.  If it feels like a criticism  maybe<br/>\nthere really is something inside  that needs to be examined.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you really did get &quot;What I do when this happens&quot;  responses and<br/>\nyou just didn&#39;t read them that way.  I DO see the responses here that<br/>\nway.  <br/>\nSaying that building trust with your kids is a good way to give them<br/>\nhealthy attitudes about sex and women isn&#39;t a criticism of the kind of<br/>\nparenting that&#39;s been going on so far, it&#39;s just the unschoolish way to<br/>\nsay, control and monitoring might do it but wouldn&#39;t everyone be better<br/>\noff if there was no reason to control and monitor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes things that really make me mad and defensive are things I need<br/>\nto look at within myself and sort out.  <br/>\nPeople here really are trying to offer good unschooling information.  No<br/>\none wants to hurt anyone else.  If you start from there, maybe the posts<br/>\nwill seem less threatening to you. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L, only scary in the mornings, before coffee.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43285,"nextTopicId":43477}}
