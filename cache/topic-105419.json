And he would have stayed being a kid at home with his Mom, without <br/>\nlabels, going on living the way we always had.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t have support then or know where to find it.  We talked often, he <br/>\nonly went for 3 hours a day, he enjoyed it.  From 1130-230, for him it was <br/>\nplaytime, for me it was a nightmare.  He still had the same freedoms he always had.  <br/>\nIf he didn&#39;t want to go, he wouldn&#39;t.  I was scared about testing and <br/>\nevaluations and all that other stuff just because he had become of compulsory school <br/>\nage.  So I sent him.  He loved it and towards the end when I was hating it, he <br/>\nwanted to finish, I didn&#39;t.  He did finish K and didn&#39;t want to go back.  His <br/>\nteacher had told him the next year would be all day and he would eat lunch <br/>\nthere and blah blah blah.  He had fun in K but didn&#39;t like the idea of going <br/>\n&quot;all day.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t it about choices?  If he asked me to attend now, I would let him.  I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want it but that&#39;s not what this is about.  I&#39;ve heard many people say <br/>\ntheir kids wanted to attend for the social or whatever.  So they are no longer <br/>\nunschoolers?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I meant by not getting the term &quot;unschooled&quot; was that it almost sounded <br/>\nto me like no learning at all.  So in the beginning I didn&#39;t get it.  I <br/>\nremember telling someone that we were unschoolers and she was like, &quot;oh, you don&#39;t <br/>\nsend them to school, you teach them at home .&quot;  I said yes to that but added <br/>\nthat unschooling as opposed to homeschooling, is life learning, no curriculum.  <br/>\nI will probably never explain it just right but that was the easiest way to <br/>\nput it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought unschooling was a lifestyle, a philosophy of natural learning, a <br/>\nway for children to develop their personal and intellectual needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because mine went to K, are we not unschoolers?  Do you have to start from <br/>\nday one and never, ever go to school?  Maybe my label is wrong cuz he went <br/>\none year?<br/>\n<br/>\nStaying home definitely doesn&#39;t mean unschooled for everyone, but for us it <br/>\ndid and does, as far as what I understand the term to mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now that I am questioning the term again, what do you call the kids who <br/>\ncome home after years of schooling and then the family aims at UNschooling?  Is <br/>\nthere another term for this?  They&#39;ve been to school, so they are schooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t get it.  All I know is we sidetracked to K when I was not sure of <br/>\nthings.  What we did before that year was not school at home, he was just a kid <br/>\nwith his Mom, true.  But that&#39;s all he is now too.  What we were before and now <br/>\nis exactly the same except that I have to account for him because he is of <br/>\nage.  He is unschooled now because we don&#39;t do school anywhere.  But we didn&#39;t <br/>\nbefore either.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI get it and I don&#39;t.  I really need and want to go to that Live and Learn <br/>\nConference!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPamela <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"problems with claiming unschooling retroactively","postDate":"1113843464","msgId":105419,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFiOS4xMWM0N2Q2ZS4yZjk1NDEwOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":105425,"prevInTime":105418,"nextInTime":105420,"topicId":105419,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think  I have always been an unschooler.
