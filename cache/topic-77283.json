It&#39;s done with voice and body language (their main <br/>\nmeans of communication)---and often includes touch.<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman hands ARE our weapons. And our brains are too. <br/>\n<br/>\nMares and foals (colts are just the males---and then we get into that whole <br/>\n&quot;bad boy&quot; thang again! &lt;g&gt;)----I have never seen a mare actually bite or kick a <br/>\nfoal in anger. Other horses, yes---but never her foal. If she&#39;d disciplining, <br/>\nshe might &quot;bite&quot; with lips, not teeth, but usually body language will keep <br/>\nthe foal in line. She&#39;ll kick &quot;at&quot; a foal, but I&#39;ve never seen a mare actually <br/>\nconnect on purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen apes to horrendous things to each other, but never a mom to her own <br/>\nhealthy infant.<br/>\n<br/>\nBig cats? That swat would level me or you, but the cub might just tumble. If <br/>\nshe &quot;wanted&quot; to inflict pain, she certainly *could*. She doesn&#39;t. What would <br/>\nshe gain?<br/>\n<br/>\nA bitch will &quot;pin&quot; a puppy to the ground or bite *at* him, but she won&#39;t bite <br/>\nhim. Hers are teeth than could literally rip the flesh right off that puppy, <br/>\nbut she doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot of violence in the animal world, but not to one&#39;s own infant.<br/>\n<br/>\nHumans are different. Not only do we have MANY more means at our disposal to <br/>\nbe kind and gentle, we think of some of the *most* horrible punishments and <br/>\npains to inflict on innocent bodies. Spankings, whippings, drinking out of the <br/>\ntoilet (I&#39;m so sorry, Dar!), burning little fingers, shaming, humiliating, <br/>\ngroundings,.... It&#39;s impossible to justify.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnimals have limited means, yet they peacefully and gently parent their <br/>\nyoung. There is NO instinct to harm the young of any species. The instinct to to <br/>\nNOT harm---that&#39;s why infants are not &quot;adult-like&quot; in apprearance, but <br/>\n&quot;infantile&quot;. So they WON&#39;T get hurt, by their mothers or other adults.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":56051484,"authorName":"grlynbl@aol.com","from":"grlynbl@...","profile":"tbb1967","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Instinct to hit","postDate":"1058890895","msgId":77300,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyYS4yZTVmYTc5OC4yYzRlYmU4ZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77298,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":77299,"nextInTime":77301,"topicId":77283,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/22/03 11:53:05 AM Eastern Daylight Time, grlynbl@aol.com ...

It causes me to often wonder that what <br/>\nappears violent to humans is not so with other species.

We are hopefully more able to reason and use more tools than a Tiger!<br/>\nIt just all seems so obvious to me, that hitting is not an acceptable form of problem solving.

If Oom/Chris had been doing something her dh didn&#39;t like and he smacked her in front of a bunch of people that cheered, just how would THAT have felt?<br/>\nHumiliating?<br/>\nDestructive?<br/>\nOf course!<br/>\nAnd if the child&#39;s pants prevented any pain, then how did the hit have ANYTHING to do with the intended results (to stop him)? If it was only the humiliation, I guess the hit still didn&#39;t have to happen. And if humiliation is how you want to stop your child from doing dangerous things then you aren&#39;t going to get support for that here either.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77282,"nextTopicId":77227}}
