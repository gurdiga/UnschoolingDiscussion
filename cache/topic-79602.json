Kids don&#39;t <br/>\nlike clean up. It overwhelms them. There is the wshing of <br/>\nbrushes, the throwing away of papers, the putting caps back on <br/>\nfinicky paint bottles, the wiping of the table, the hanging of <br/>\npictures to dry out of the way, the stacking of extrra papers neatly <br/>\nin a cabinet...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe forget how naturally all this organization and clean up comes <br/>\nto us adults.

I want <br/>\nthem to create, I want them to play and I want them to feel free to <br/>\nuse the tools in our house. when the messes rise to an <br/>\nunacceptable level for my peace of mind, I dig in to clean what <br/>\nbugs me most and I ask for help. I don&#39;t guilt (usually, unless I&#39;m <br/>\nin the middle of PMS &lt;g&gt;) but I say my needs clearly and ask for <br/>\nwhen someone might be free to help. I often get good <br/>\nresponses for that. I may even say: &quot;Hey I see all your dolls and <br/>\ntheir clothing on the couches. Can you collect them and I&#39;ll put <br/>\nthem away?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to think of it as pitching in together. Have I ever been <br/>\nresentful of how messy it&#39;s gotten at times?

More kids would seek emancipated minor status if<br/>\n&gt; they knew they could make their own decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>99.9% of kids (a statistic I just handily made up, but probably fairly<br/>\naccurate) DO NOT sign contracts. A handful of emancipated minors who have<br/>\nbeen judged competent to make their own decisions doesn&#39;t change the<br/>\napplicability of Sandra&#39;s post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m sorry, but I just don&#39;t understand what is wrong with letting<br/>\n&gt; kids be responsible for their own actions.   If I signed a contract<br/>\n&gt; specifying that I promised to do something, I would do it, because I<br/>\n&gt; believe it is unethical to not fulfill a contractual agreement that I<br/>\n&gt; freely entered into.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Great. But that&#39;s you. You can talk to your children about your ethics. You<br/>\ncan model your ethics. But they are still your ethics and not theirs, and<br/>\nattempting to force them to BE theirs isn&#39;t the way to produce an ethical<br/>\nhuman being.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Now what is a child learning when he is<br/>\n&gt; allowed to make a choice but not allowed to experience the<br/>\n&gt; consequences of that choice?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Consequences are interesting things. There are natural consequences in life<br/>\n(blow in a dog&#39;s face long enough, he&#39;ll probably bite you) and imposed<br/>\nconsequences (try to quit badminton lessons and Mom forces you to keep<br/>\ngoing). Kids (and adults) learn from either type, but WHAT they learn is<br/>\ndifferent. With the first, they learn one thing that will make a dog bite<br/>\nand will probably see the sense in avoiding it. In the second, they learn<br/>\nthat if they make a mistake their parent will not help them out of it, and<br/>\nthey learn something entirely different.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If your child asks you if he can paint a picture, and you say yes,<br/>\n&gt; but specify that he has to clean up the mess when he is done, are you<br/>\n&gt; going to then clean up the mess for him because when it&#39;s time to do<br/>\n&gt; the actual work of clean up, he wines about having to do his part,<br/>\n&gt; which was stated beforehand?  Or would you say yes to his<br/>\n&gt; request to paint without making him responsible in any way for the<br/>\n&gt; clean-up?  When you and your child make this agreement about the<br/>\n&gt; paint, that is a contract.  Your child gets the privilege of painting<br/>\n&gt; in return for fulfilling his responsibility to clean up.  We involve<br/>\n&gt; our children in contracts all the time, we just don&#39;t make them sign<br/>\n&gt; on the dotted line.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some of us also help with the clean up, or kindly clean up for them if they<br/>\nsay afterwards, &quot;I&#39;m too tired.&quot; Our family helps each other. This morning,<br/>\nas I was cleaning rabbit cages and trying to cope with a dozen cheerfully<br/>\nleaping 5 week old bunnies, I asked for help from my daughter (who was busy<br/>\ndoing something else) and she gave that help, very willingly. Later, her<br/>\nsister needed assistance with a paint bottle. I helped her. Sometime after<br/>\nthat, my oldest (8) came to me and said, &quot;Next time you wash dishes will you<br/>\nshow me how? I want to learn.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of badgering each other to fulfill our contractual obligations,<br/>\nwe&#39;re just nice to each other as a matter of policy. Works for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79765,"nextTopicId":79720}}
