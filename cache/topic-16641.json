But, I need a job that I can work at home <br/>\nlike on my computer.  I have no idea how to do it.  I have seen so <br/>\nmany &quot;job offers&quot; that sound like a chain letter type thing - you <br/>\nsend the person at the top of the list $5 and we&#39;ll put your name at <br/>\nthe bottom, etc.  Or we&#39;ll sell you an address list and you sell each <br/>\none of them an address list, etc.  I don&#39;t want to do that kind of <br/>\nthing.  Does anyone know what I can do?  I don&#39;t want to put the kids <br/>\nin day-care or anything.  I&#39;m pretty desperate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelanie in Indiana</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16580,"nextTopicId":16644}}
