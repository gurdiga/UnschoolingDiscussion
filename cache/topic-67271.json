He won the competition by creating his own &quot;cards&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;play&quot; based on his research as he said the cards he needed were <br/>\ntoo hard to get.  He ended up finding a job writing a column for a <br/>\ngaming site for this particular game through the internet!

I think the internet has alot of <br/>\nopportunities if you are willing to scan (which can be terribly <br/>\noverwhelming).  Maybe if there is something he really loves, this can <br/>\ninspire him to think out of the box because ironically his parents <br/>\nwere giving hom the same ideas about mowing lawns and stuff.
