I have been here this time<br/>\nsince Nov., but I have dropped in  a couple times over the years and then<br/>\nleft due to the volume of mail and what I felt at the time was the tone of<br/>\nthe list. (I will address that below)  <br/>\n <br/>\nI live with my dh of 15 years (when he isn&#39;t on the road) and my two dd&#39;s<br/>\nLeigh (8) and Lilly (6) in Maine.  I began my parenting journey by following<br/>\nmy heart which I eventually found out was attachment parenting.   I have<br/>\nlearned so much about parenting from on-line communities and books though<br/>\nand I continue to try to improve my parenting and myself all the time.  I am<br/>\nnot a perfect parent, but a work in progress and I am very happy with my<br/>\nprogress.  :0)  <br/>\n <br/>\nI discovered unschooling about a year before my oldest was school aged.  I<br/>\nfigured it was what we had always done so in one aspect it was easy to<br/>\ncontinue.  The hardest part was telling the relatives that I was<br/>\nhomeschooling, but we haven&#39;t looked back since.  Last year when we had our<br/>\nfirst annual review by a certified teacher, I was pretty nervous, but with<br/>\nthe help of a couple unschooling lists, I got through it.  Yeah!!  :0)  <br/>\n <br/>\nLilly (6) is into writing stories or recording them for me to type.  She is<br/>\nvery long winded (some of her stories are ten chapters long) and her stories<br/>\nare wonderful.  She is very imaginative and wants to publish her stories.<br/>\nShe loves to swim and ride horses and listen to me read aloud.  She likes to<br/>\ncross country ski, ice skate, and snow shoe.  She is funny and sweet and<br/>\nsensitive.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeigh (8) loves to ride horses and play with her sister or friends.  She<br/>\nloves board games and card games, listening to me read aloud, helping Lilly<br/>\ntype her stories and spell some of the words, she also loves geography and<br/>\nhas since she was about 4.  She is a wonder with a globe.  She also loves to<br/>\nswim.  She likes to cross country ski, ice skate, and snow shoe.  She is<br/>\nvery sensitive and loving and love to be with me.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI like to knit esp. with wool or mohair.  I love to read non-fiction and an<br/>\noccasional fiction book.  I enjoy baking bread and eating it and it shows.<br/>\n:0)  I enjoy cross country skiing, snow shoeing, sliding with the kids, and<br/>\nice-skating.  I enjoy being part of email lists and emailing friends.  I<br/>\nenjoy journaling, when I remember to do it.  I enjoy swimming and I enjoy<br/>\nreading or watching shows about history, esp. the history of our country.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI have come to this list a few times over the last couple of years thinking<br/>\nit was a support list.  I felt like the list as a whole was too rough on new<br/>\npeople and that the tone of the list was negative.  I didn&#39;t understand what<br/>\nyou were trying to do here, but now I get it!!  (happy dance!)  I think I<br/>\nhave come far enough in my unschooling journey/non-coercive parenting<br/>\njourney that in order to continue to grow, I need what this list<br/>\nprovides...the tearing apart of ideas and discussing them in every detail.<br/>\nIt really helps me to reflect on why I do the things I do and how I can<br/>\nchange to become a better person and parent. (and I can see now that the<br/>\nlist mostly sticks to tearing apart the issues, not the parents)  I most<br/>\ndefinitely didn&#39;t understand you at first, Sandra.  But upon reading your<br/>\nname all over the web again and again, I kept thinking that if so many<br/>\npeople have benefited from your ideas and love you, then you must have<br/>\nsomething to share that is worth reading.  I tried the list once again and<br/>\nthis time I *got* it.  You really get people to think.  (I like that!)  And<br/>\nthe list is not a support group, but a place that tries to uphold the<br/>\ndefinition of unschooling so that people don&#39;t get confused about what<br/>\ndefines unschooling. (at least on this list.)<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you.
