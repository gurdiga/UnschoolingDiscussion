It seems to me that one of the major lessons we<br/>\nas homeschooling parents have to share (especially those of us who were<br/>\nnot homeschooled ourselves) is that we have seen modern &quot;education&quot;<br/>\nunmasked for what it really is.  And what I see is that modern schooling<br/>\nis based on 3 (and only 3) great organizing principles, which all<br/>\nchildren are required to operate on:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. They are to learn a content not of their own choosing.<br/>\n2. They are to learn it on a timetable not of their own making.<br/>\n3. Education consists of the transference of information from the head<br/>\nof an adult assigned to &quot;teach&quot; to their own brains.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that everything else -- good teachers/bad teachers, good<br/>\nschools/bad schools, strict discipline/loose discipline, old math/new<br/>\nmath, etc. etc. is but dross compared with theses three principles.<br/>\nWhat I think has changed, however, is children may be finding fewer and<br/>\nfewer opportunities in families and communities to live their lives<br/>\nwhich are not organized around these principles.  Hence, we see more<br/>\npassivity and, occasionally, more violence among children -- just<br/>\ndifferent ways of expressing powerlessness -- which is the inevitable<br/>\nresult of the three organizing principles.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool systems know this, too, and the public mistrust that they are<br/>\nbreeding.  The solution they offer is micromanagement, stricter<br/>\norganization so that children cannot fail but operate with the three<br/>\nprinciples in mind.  It will fail -- but the cost in human creativity<br/>\nis, and will continue to be, enormous.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts...<br/>\n<br/>\ndavid albert<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nAnthony Manousos calls &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me: Adventures in<br/>\nHomeschooling and Community-Based Education&quot; &quot;a joyous celebration of<br/>\nthe creative potential in every child.&quot; To read a sample chapter,<br/>\nreviewers&#39; comments, or the foreword, and for ordering info., visit my<br/>\nwebsite at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.skylarksings.com\">http://www.skylarksings.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4727,"nextTopicId":4639}}
