(And I&#39;m not much of a group person anyways.)<br/>\n <br/>\nThey spent time discussing their home schooling problems and curriculum and<br/>\nI felt like I had nothing to add to the conversation most of the time.  When<br/>\nI did add my two cents worth from an unschooling perspective, *I* felt like<br/>\nI they thought I was off my rocker or that only people with precocious kids<br/>\ncould unschool.  It couldn&#39;t work for them.  Their kids just aren&#39;t that<br/>\nmotivated.  yada yada yada.  They were respectful of my choice though.<br/>\n <br/>\nOne example:  Someone was looking for a math curriculum that had teaching<br/>\ntime in it for a second grader.  I replied that time was one of those things<br/>\nthat kids pick up easily from asking ...what time is it?  so often.  It<br/>\nisn&#39;t necessary to have it covered in a curriculum.  Her response....I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave time to answer &quot;what time is it&quot; all day long.  I am too busy teaching<br/>\nthe kids.  It needs to be covered in the curriculum so he will learn it.   I<br/>\njust felt so out of place that it wasn&#39;t a comfortable place for me by my<br/>\nown choice.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThat said, my unschooling talk did influence one person who at least &quot;tried<br/>\nunschooling&quot; for a little while.  I am afraid she didn&#39;t quite grasp the<br/>\nconcept completely though and eventually gave up and sent her kids to public<br/>\nschool.  :0(  Later on I found out that another person who participated in<br/>\nthat group (but didn&#39;t go to the same church, like everyone else) is a very<br/>\nlaid back homeschooler who basically teaches with games.   I just hadn&#39;t<br/>\nreally talked with her much at the group events. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt is certainly possible to meet other people in a Christian group who are<br/>\nmore laid back in their approach to home schooling.  Maybe your kids will<br/>\nhit it off and you will be able to keep the conversation on anything *but*<br/>\nreligion.  I&#39;d give it a try if it were my only choice.<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope you enjoy living in the country again.  :0)<br/>\n <br/>\nAngela <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":166215589,"authorName":"Mattamandab@aol.com","from":"Mattamandab@...","profile":"amandabokus","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"christian support groups, vs. none","postDate":"1083714890","msgId":93465,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMC4yZTg0MDlhNi4yZGM5ODc0YUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":93469,"prevInTime":93464,"nextInTime":93466,"topicId":93465,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone!
