One of <br/>\nmy favorite things is her suggestion to listen to the plants and <br/>\ntrees with a stethoscope.  This year we have a stethoscope and I <br/>\ncan&#39;t wait to do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Square foot gardening / by Mel Bartholomew is fabulous.  One of <br/>\nhis most freeing (to me) gardening points is that all vining plants <br/>\ncan be grown vertically, except perhaps with the exception of giants <br/>\nlike giant pumpkins and hubbard squash.  But with a strip of grass <br/>\nyou could dig it and erect a 60ft tall structure with jack o <br/>\nlanterns, pumpkins, various vining beans and flowers, etc.  Or make <br/>\na pole tent and grow these things.  Birdhouse gourds or yard-long <br/>\nrunner beans might be fun to grow in a tipi, and the gourds would <br/>\nprolong into winter fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKristi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93969,"nextTopicId":93978}}
