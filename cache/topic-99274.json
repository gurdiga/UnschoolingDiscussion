We&#39;ll also <br/>\nbe  travelling the Natchez Trace from southern Mississippi to southern <br/>\nTennessee  and taking a look at some non-Civil War sites there, as  well.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m only a few weeks behind. Still catching up. Sorry!<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Question first:  Have you been to any CW sites that  were particularly <br/>\n </span></blockquote>riveting that we just shouldn&#39;t  miss?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGettysburg is a DON&#39;T MISS, of course. Very touristy, but informative. Be  <br/>\nsure to get one of the guides that will drive your car through the battlefields  <br/>\nand explain what happened when, why, and how. Really great. The Lincoln <br/>\nDiner&#39;s  a great place to eat. Downtown.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe were fascinated with the battle of Petersburg near Richmond. It&#39;s hard  to <br/>\nbelieve what actually happened there with the miners and all. Really great,  <br/>\nand you can look into the pit and see how big it was.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Third: Any great places to eat or stay?  We&#39;re  looking at a tight <br/>\n </span></blockquote>budget, but can splurge once in  awhile.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nElissa&#39;s nearby! &lt;g&gt; But the KAO campgrounds are pretty good around  there. <br/>\nCabin&#39;s are cheap. I mentioned the Lincoln Diner in Gettysburg. Boys  loved <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Fourth:  Good scenic routes?  In  particular, can anyone tell me if <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interstate 81 through western Virginia is  good?  I&#39;d love to be able to get off <br/>\nthe interstates altogether and take  back roads, but we just won&#39;t have the <br/>\ntime.  The map looks like 81 goes  right through the long middle of the W. <br/>\nVirginia mountains on the west and the  Blue Ridge on the East.  Is it nice there, <br/>\nor have they managed to make  that interstate as boring as so many others?  We <br/>\nwill, however, be able  to take back roads for select periods.  Any  <br/>\nfavorites?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n I like I-81, but the Blue Ridge Parkway is runs righ along-side it a  good <br/>\nways. There&#39;s a B&B  we stay at a lot in Floyd County (Ambrosia  Inn---Caroline <br/>\n& Craig are the innkeepers); we&#39;re regulars! &lt;g&gt; Google  them, you won&#39;t be <br/>\ndisappointed. They have a 9-10 year old son, Ian, who is  darling. We&#39;ve <br/>\ndiscussed unschooling at length: they&#39;re *almost* ready to  take the plunge. &lt;G&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\nOn I-81 there are also the caves to explore----a sign almost every  mile or <br/>\nso. The closer you get to PA (through West Virginia and Maryland),  there&#39;s <br/>\nsomething to see or do.<br/>\n <br/>\nGood luck! And have a great time!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99147,"nextTopicId":99277}}
