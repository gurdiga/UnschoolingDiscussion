I <br/>\npicked one up because my DD wanted to look at it (she&#39;s 2.5 and <br/>\nliked the animals on the front cover).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time that we got to the check out, I decided to buy if for <br/>\nher because she was calling it a coloring book and was actually <br/>\nmaking up stories to go along with the pictures. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had it for a few days now and mostly she has just colored in <br/>\nit and continued to &quot;read&quot; to me from it based on what the pictures <br/>\nare on the page.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToday, I have to admit, that she surprised me.  We were coloring and <br/>\nthe page was one where there were colored crayons on one side and <br/>\npictures on the other and you were supposed to draw a line to match <br/>\nthe pictures with the crayons....I hope that makes sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, she points to the leaf and says that it&#39;s green and then <br/>\ndraws a line from the leaf to the green crayon!  She proceeds to do <br/>\nthe same with the other pictures on the page (getting them all <br/>\ncorrect, by the way).  Then, she got bored with that and fliped the <br/>\npage and continued to color.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI never told her what to do with the workbook and had only gotten it <br/>\nso that she would have a really big coloring book but.....guess she <br/>\nlearned dispite me!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89703,"nextTopicId":89779}}
