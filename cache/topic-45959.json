Someone had <br/>\nmentioned to him that his middle finger was a bad finger.  I told him that <br/>\nhe had no bad fingers; all his fingers were only fingers and there were no <br/>\nbad ones.  But, I told him that when you wave your hand at someone you <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to say anything else for them to know that you&#39;re saying hello <br/>\nor goodbye.  I told him that in our society, holding up your middle finger <br/>\nall by itself is a symbol for other people to know that you&#39;re saying <br/>\nsomething really mean to them, whether you have a smile on your face or <br/>\nnot.  Communication is like that; we have symbols and symbols have meanings <br/>\nand everyone agrees to honor these definitions.  I told my son that if he <br/>\ntried it out to see what would happen, he could get himself in a heap of <br/>\ntrouble!
