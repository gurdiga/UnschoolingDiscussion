This is a wonderful list!  I&#39;ve been reading and wanting to jump in, I<br/>\nm ready now but thought maybe a little intro would be appropriate...or not.<br/>\nlol  We are Tammy (me), Keith (hubby), Haley (9), Kayla (8), Katy (5),<br/>\nDenver (2).  Sometime around 32 (I agree with you Sandra, my mom also<br/>\nstarted looking for answers around that age) it hit me that how we were<br/>\nliving was just yuck.  We moved to NW Mississippi after 2 years of Memphis<br/>\n(TN) City Public Schools...ugggg.   What a bad taste that was!  We started<br/>\nhome-schooling but I hated pushing, they hated &quot;doing school&quot;.  As a teen I<br/>\nsaw no tangible reason to have all this info pushed on me without my<br/>\napproval, then I saw it happening to my kids.  No wonder we rebel so much as<br/>\nteens.  NO more...we are free, and you all came at just the perfect time. <br/>\nSupport is here! :-)  I&#39;m so excited.  My two oldest still have a bit a<br/>\nde-schooling yet to get their trust in me back...I was so pushy and<br/>\nirritable.  I finally let it go and it&#39;s amazing to see all the discoveries<br/>\nbeing made all by themselves....all I had to do was open my eyes leave them<br/>\nalone!  Amazing.  The only support groups that I am aware of in my area are<br/>\nnot for us, and I don&#39;t know of un-schoolers in my area, but surely there<br/>\nare...I&#39;ll find them.   Anyway, great to be here. :-D\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTammy\r<br/>\n(unschoolers: 41, 34, 9, 8, 5, 2)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66082,"nextTopicId":66069}}
