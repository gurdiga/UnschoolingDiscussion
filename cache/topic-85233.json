The old man (Rusty) just turned 9 and looks on us all<br/>\nwith bewilderment and disgust. My daughter&#39;s cat (Chanel) is not quite 2 and<br/>\nstill spastic. Cody is not quite 6 months and really spastic and the new<br/>\none, (yes we got another) is only about 8-9 weeks old. That&#39;s Teddy and is<br/>\nadjusting to the house as he&#39;s only been here for days. He&#39;s spastic in his<br/>\nown right just not all over the house yet. He should be ready by Christmas.<br/>\n&lt;BEG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the spray bottle works for them all except Chanel. She loves water.<br/>\nHer and Rusy have learned to stay off the kitchen counters though. Cody<br/>\nhasn&#39;t got that lesson yet. I&#39;ll squirt until he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as furniture goes, they have spray stuff you can use that has worked<br/>\nfor me in keeping the cats from scratching the couch. I also found that<br/>\nclear strapping tape is great to put on the ends of the sofa where a cat<br/>\nwould want to scratch. You can&#39;t really see the tape as it&#39;s clear and the<br/>\ncats don&#39;t like the feel of it and don&#39;t scratch there.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Spirited Kitten","postDate":"1069621344","msgId":85233,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2NS4yODM2NjUzYS4yY2YyN2E2MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":85246,"prevInTime":85232,"nextInTime":85234,"topicId":85233,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/23/2003 9:23:08 AM Eastern Standard Time, UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-226619369\">In a message dated 11/23/2003 9:23:08 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Do you have one that would work for a cat?
