I&#39;ve tried searching the archives<br/>\n  but can&#39;t do an exact phrase search, and the search topic, &quot;school,&quot; would<br/>\n  obviously return every message.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My oldest daughter is 8 (I have 3 other children between 16 mths and 6).<br/>\n  She has mentioned a few times that she wants to try school and is very<br/>\n  interested right now in visiting school.  She wants homework, she wants<br/>\n  lessons.  We&#39;ve never schooled, nor followed any curriculum in our<br/>\n  homeschooling journey, read on a schedule.  I could continue to try to<br/>\n  analyze it forever and have been pondering it for weeks before deciding to<br/>\n  just come here and ask for help.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hit a personal crisis mode when I realized she really does want to go to<br/>\n  school, and got a mother&#39;s helper to play with my two young boys so I can<br/>\n  have time just to be with my older two.  If my daughters need more of my<br/>\n  undivided attention, I&#39;m happy to have my boys play nearby with the<br/>\n  babysitter while we play games, cook, do our fun big girl things.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If respecting her curiosity means she tries school, she&#39;ll go visit a school<br/>\n  in the Spring.  My instincts tell me that she is wanting more activities<br/>\n  with friends her age, she is thirsty for learning - whatever level of<br/>\n  facilitation I&#39;ve been providing isn&#39;t enough.  I&#39;ll obviously work on<br/>\n  those.  If she wants worksheets, or more book-based learning, I can adapt to<br/>\n  help her explore that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know that even if I shift my paradigm to keep up with her needs, and even<br/>\n  if I satisfy those needs, she still may choose to try school.  That&#39;s where<br/>\n  I need help - with dealing with my own feelings.  I have really basic strong<br/>\n  objections to institutionalized learning, as probably everyone here does.  I<br/>\n  have to let my kids be free to form their own opinions.  Hopefully I&#39;m<br/>\n  worrying prematurely over nothing, but have felt quite anxious and even<br/>\n  depressed at the thought of her choosing schooling.  Have even felt betrayed<br/>\n  by her, even though logically I&#39;ve always firmly believed that kids should<br/>\n  be able to sample and choose their own paths - so here she is ready to<br/>\n  sample and I&#39;m not ready emotionally.

I&#39;ve tried searching the archives<br/>\nbut can&#39;t do an exact phrase search, and the search topic, &quot;school,&quot; would<br/>\nobviously return every message.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter is 8 (I have 3 other children between 16 mths and 6).<br/>\nShe has mentioned a few times that she wants to try school and is very<br/>\ninterested right now in visiting school.  She wants homework, she wants<br/>\nlessons.  We&#39;ve never schooled, nor followed any curriculum in our<br/>\nhomeschooling journey, read on a schedule.  I could continue to try to<br/>\nanalyze it forever and have been pondering it for weeks before deciding to<br/>\njust come here and ask for help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hit a personal crisis mode when I realized she really does want to go to<br/>\nschool, and got a mother&#39;s helper to play with my two young boys so I can<br/>\nhave time just to be with my older two.  If my daughters need more of my<br/>\nundivided attention, I&#39;m happy to have my boys play nearby with the<br/>\nbabysitter while we play games, cook, do our fun big girl things.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf respecting her curiosity means she tries school, she&#39;ll go visit a school<br/>\nin the Spring.  My instincts tell me that she is wanting more activities<br/>\nwith friends her age, she is thirsty for learning - whatever level of<br/>\nfacilitation I&#39;ve been providing isn&#39;t enough.  I&#39;ll obviously work on<br/>\nthose.  If she wants worksheets, or more book-based learning, I can adapt to<br/>\nhelp her explore that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that even if I shift my paradigm to keep up with her needs, and even<br/>\nif I satisfy those needs, she still may choose to try school.  That&#39;s where<br/>\nI need help - with dealing with my own feelings.  I have really basic strong<br/>\nobjections to institutionalized learning, as probably everyone here does.  I<br/>\nhave to let my kids be free to form their own opinions.  Hopefully I&#39;m<br/>\nworrying prematurely over nothing, but have felt quite anxious and even<br/>\ndepressed at the thought of her choosing schooling.  Have even felt betrayed<br/>\nby her, even though logically I&#39;ve always firmly believed that kids should<br/>\nbe able to sample and choose their own paths - so here she is ready to<br/>\nsample and I&#39;m not ready emotionally.  How do you reconcile your own<br/>\nobjections to school with the prospect of having one or more of your kids in<br/>\nschool?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is long enough and my feelings are tender so I don&#39;t want to ramble any<br/>\nfurther.

And people are accustomed <br/>\nto going to a book or magazine or website and getting the simple five or ten <br/>\nfacts they wanted, and then going and doing their project.  When to divide <br/>\nbulbs and what fertilizer they need.  How to clean a fireplace or who to call and <br/>\nhow often.   What to substitute for buttermilk in a recipe.   Where to get <br/>\npool chemicals, if you live in the boonies and want to mail order.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo people look into homeschooling and they see that what happens is a family <br/>\nbuys a curriculum.  Oh!  Here are some people who don&#39;t.  Okay, instead of the <br/>\ncurriculum, what do I use?  And hurry, I don&#39;t have much time to read online. <br/>\n And could you e-mail it to me, because I might not find my way back to this <br/>\nforum.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are other factors too, more subtle.  Language works with <br/>\nlabels.  Words are labels.  People like to know who they are by what they&#39;re called, <br/>\nbut they claim not to like it.  &quot;I don&#39;t like to be labelled&quot; is a form of <br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m an individualistic person too cool to be pegged, and I like to intimidate <br/>\nother people to try make them think I can control how they may refer to me.&quot;  <br/>\nThat&#39;s a lot of labelling right there.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristians are Christians the moment they&#39;re baptised or confirmed or the <br/>\nmoment they&#39;re born again.  No other approval.  &quot;You&#39;re in.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJews are Jewish when they&#39;re born to a Jewish mom.  They&#39;re in.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who enroll in a school are students there.  There are Montessori <br/>\nstudents, and Waldorf students, and honor students, and pre-med students (I love <br/>\nthat one especially:  &quot;I&#39;m pre-med&quot;) and law students...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut with unschooling it doesn&#39;t quite work that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is more like riding a bike.<br/>\n<br/>\nOwning a bike doesn&#39;t make you a bicyclist, nor even a bike rider.<br/>\nWalking the bike around certainly shows you&#39;re not a rider.  <br/>\nTalking about riding it doesn&#39;t make you a bike rider.<br/>\nSigning up for a course in bike riding (is there even such a thing??) would <br/>\nnot make you a bike rider, nor would a certificate saying you had completed a <br/>\ncourse in bike riding change a damned thing if you couldn&#39;t get on the bike and <br/>\ngo.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo with unschooling,  you can &quot;not buy the curriculum.&quot;   You can not send <br/>\nyour kids to school.   But when will you be an unschooler?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs a caterpillar a pre-butterfly?<br/>\nYou have to change inside.  Nobody can tell the caterpillar he&#39;s going to be <br/>\na butterfly.  He might easily be bird food, or road kill from a passing <br/>\nbicyclist.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way to be an unschooler is to change the way you see and think, so that <br/>\nyou can change the way you act and react..<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody can act like a bicyclist (maybe on an off-the-ground bike with a <br/>\nbluescreen for a movie, but that&#39;s not riding a real bike for real).  You either <br/>\nare doing it or you&#39;re not.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople can&#39;t act like unschoolers and fool unschoolers into thinking they&#39;re <br/>\nreally riding it.   They have to become unschoolers inside themselves to the <br/>\npoint that they&#39;re not always asking &quot;Is this book okay?  Is this idea okay?  <br/>\nIs this game educational in any way, and how?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s okay to ask at first, but I think some people think they can ask for <br/>\ntwelve or thirteen years, instead of really becoming unschoolers at the depth <br/>\nwhere it is part of their thinking and being.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd those who thinking asking forever is the same as being get angry when <br/>\nthose same people they were asking for help or approval say &quot;You&#39;re not thinking <br/>\nit yet.  You&#39;re not keeping your balance yet.  Just go fast enough to feel how <br/>\nyou need to balance.  Ride it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I asked &quot;Which pedal should I start with?&quot; after two years of riding a <br/>\nbike, my friends and relatives might think I was really not too bright at all.  <br/>\n&quot;How far should I lean when I turn?&quot;  Exactly far enough.  It works by itself, <br/>\nwhen you do it.  When you become an unschooler, you will know kids are <br/>\nlearning because you see their eyes,  you hear their breathing, you see their posture <br/>\nand you&#39;re there with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so some people, when they read things like that, think &quot;AH!  So nobody <br/>\ncan tell me if I&#39;m unschooling or not!  Whatever I say is unschooling is, <br/>\nbecause kids learn all the time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah.   But if the other bicyclists see you back at the starting point <br/>\nmessing awkwardly with your handlebars and not really going anywhere, what you say <br/>\nyou are or can do just won&#39;t impress them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther people buy their unschooling.  We&#39;re making our own out of our lives <br/>\nand families and homes.   We transform our lives into unschooling lives, and <br/>\nit&#39;s just not the same as showing your Calvert receipt and saying &quot;We use <br/>\nCalvert; the box should arrive next week.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101378,"nextTopicId":101392}}
