It was my impression that by auditing, you just <br/>\nshowed up for the class and participated, but received no grade, paid no fees, etc. <br/>\nBut then I heard that you DO still pay the tuition, etc. but receive no <br/>\ngrade. Does it vary by college? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUmmmmm.....it helps if you&#39;re best friends with the professor! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPatrick is a good friend. He&#39;s been offering to let us sit in on his classes <br/>\nfor years. We finally took him up on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatrick&#39;s a high school drop-out (tenth grade, eventually took the GED). He <br/>\nenlisted in the army (he learned Czech & was a spy); he got an undergraduate <br/>\ndegree, went on for his Masters, and is ABD for his PhD in Sociology. He&#39;s a <br/>\nhuge John Holt fan. He is required by the University to give grades----so he asks <br/>\nthe students to tell him what they think they deserve! &lt;g&gt; As long as they <br/>\nshow up and do the work (minimal!), he gives them A&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\nCool Prof!<br/>\n<br/>\nI told Cameron that, if he were interested in actually going for a grade and <br/>\ncredits later this semester (for the &quot;some college&quot; answer), we would sign him <br/>\nup in Patrick&#39;s other class. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I have no real answer for auditting----just our route right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89075,"nextTopicId":88972}}
