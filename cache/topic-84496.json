My friend&#39;s oldest girl is married and expecting first <br/>\nbaby. Just got her Mary Kay car. Hubby making good money as computer <br/>\nexpert. She&#39;s been on her own for five years and nothing too out of <br/>\ncontrol,unless it is in the consumerism she and her husband display.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer son is going to college. He&#39;d be the one I most expect to see go <br/>\nnuts, because he&#39;s gotten the most amazing accomplishments: youth <br/>\nleadership, receiving awards from state senators, meeting the <br/>\ngov...etc...  but so far he&#39;s just moving into the more intense <br/>\nstudies of the University (on a full ride scholarship)(which these <br/>\ndays to me, means he pretty much knows how to jump through the hoops <br/>\nwell enough to impress the Higher Ups, but still) Chose to stay home <br/>\nand commute to class rather than dorm life. See...even as an 18 year <br/>\nold, he prefers to be home. He had the choice of dorm or home...and <br/>\nchose to stay home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe younger daughter is in sixth grade and so far, so good. Busy <br/>\nright along with her mom. Not long ago, while my friend and I were <br/>\ntalking on the phone, the girl was cleaning out the fridge. Just got <br/>\nup from her school work and started doing it after the phone <br/>\nconversation got a little long. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll see. Maybe there&#39;ll be some angst or some delayed self-<br/>\nsearching as they enter adulthood. So far, though, nothing like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, HeidiC</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] today & tomorrow","postDate":"1068575530","msgId":84496,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NS4yNzEyMzdjMC4yY2UyODUyYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":84547,"prevInTime":84495,"nextInTime":84497,"topicId":84496,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/11/2003 11:13:59 AM Eastern Standard Time, UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com writes: anyway.
