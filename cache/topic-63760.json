Of course not 5 kids but I do<br/>\nhave 4. And even though most people tell me how lucky I am to have Tara, I<br/>\nfeel lucky in a way they are not thinking of. I have most people figure that<br/>\nbecause she&#39;s 17 she somehow doesn&#39;t need mothering and I can pretty much<br/>\nleave her on her own. That and that she can help me with the other 3. I can<br/>\ncount on one hand the times I&#39;ve actually asked Tara to watch the kids for<br/>\nme. Of course she interacts with them on her own, but not in a watching<br/>\nmothering kind of way. I certainly woulnd&#39;t expect her to. And Tara,<br/>\nalthough easier because of her age, has a whole other set of parenting<br/>\nneeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s the only time I feel the strain. When all 4 want something and<br/>\nI&#39;m just not enough of a person at once to do it. My mom tells me I have a<br/>\nrubber butt because I&#39;m bouncing up all the time. Seems like when I do get a<br/>\nchance to sit down, someone needs something and of course the others never<br/>\nneed something too until I try and sit back down!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure though that this has most to do with unschooling as much as it<br/>\ndoes just being a mom of more than 1 or 2 kids. It&#39;s hard sometimes, like<br/>\nwhen one gets sick and you just know you are going to be dealing with it for<br/>\nawhile as it makes it&#39;s way through the whole house. (like me now again!) Or<br/>\nwhen you go somewhere and 3 are having a good time and 1 is bored. With one<br/>\nchild, you either just stay or go! They get sick and then well!<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, my frustration today with Joseph and Alyssa getting sick is showing.<br/>\nWe missed a field trip today. Sierra missed sports camp last week and it<br/>\nlooks like Joseph will miss this week. We were planning on the zoo this<br/>\nweekend. Alyssa was up last night not feeling good.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s times like this that make me feel not like it&#39;s not a good unschooling<br/>\nday, just like it&#39;s not a good mother day.

Life does that to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking she meant something other than these kinds of totally  <br/>\nnormal mom-has-had-it moments (or hours).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom, who thought unschooling was the best thing in the whole world,  <br/>\ntold me that some people needed to send their kids to preschool, not to  <br/>\nlearn and get ready for school or anything like that, but so that the  <br/>\nlittle ones could have somewhere that it was okay to make a mess and  <br/>\nthat, once they were out of preschool, those poor kids NEVER got to do  <br/>\nanything that was messy ever again - that it upset their parents too  <br/>\nmuch. I really hadn&#39;t thought about what it would be like to not let  <br/>\nthe kids ever make a mess. Mine are SO messy - especially my oldest  <br/>\ndaughter (now 18) who STILL plays with mud (she is a ceramicist) and  <br/>\ndoes collaging and all kinds of art - right now she has clay all over  <br/>\nthe patio tables (I moved her outside - it started off in the house)  <br/>\nand little pieces of sea glass all over the living room coffee table  <br/>\nthat she is using to make a mosaic. I&#39;ve lived with so much mess for so  <br/>\nlong that I&#39;m used to it - but once in a while I look around and just  <br/>\nwish that I could have an &quot;ordinary&quot; house. Okay - truth is - ONCE in a  <br/>\nwhile I look around and wish I could have an &quot;ordinary&quot; family. But -  <br/>\nthat&#39;s just when they are all being TOO creative and I have these  <br/>\nmoments of thinking IF they all went to school I&#39;d have 5 or 6 hours to  <br/>\nmyself five days a week AND I could send them to bed early for good  <br/>\nreason and they&#39;d have to spend an hour or two a day doing homework and  <br/>\njust THINK of all that time I&#39;d have to ---- do what? Clean the  <br/>\nhouse??? WHAT a boring life - I&#39;d be so miserable!!!!
