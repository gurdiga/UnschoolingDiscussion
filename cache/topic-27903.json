This is the most oppressive board I&#39;ve ever been on.   On the radical unschooling board, a mother mentioned recently in passing that she monitors her children&#39;s tv viewing, I was waiting for a firestorm, then realized that this is the difference between a functional community and a non-functional one, the ability to state opinions without fear of reprisal.  I&#39;m sorry to have to leave here, and there are a few voices that I will miss, but I&#39;ve only been here a few weeks, and I find myself disgusted with the behavior of some people here.  I find myself hurt or angry by almost every post (and it takes a LOT to rile me.)  I&#39;m on other boards with many different kinds of people, including fundamentalists christians, who have not displayed the judgemental, arrogant, narcissistic behavior I&#39;ve seen here.  I&#39;m going back to the &quot;rigid&quot; hs boards where I can actually speak my mind for once.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoodbye.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:curtkar@...\">curtkar@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, November 16, 2001 5:51 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: more interested in proving a point than in having a discussion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Great analogy, Sandra.<br/>\n  I, for one, appreciate reading your thoughts and opinions on various <br/>\n  topics, unschooling or not.<br/>\n  (Is anything NOT related in some way to unschooling?)<br/>\n  My 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Karin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; -=-you are way more interested in proving a point than in having <br/>\n  a <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; I would hope that discussions about unschooling would be heavily <br/>\n  involved <br/>\n  &gt; with point making.

Maroon?&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Your son is so lucky to have you as a mom!&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;I wish I had kept my son from wearing red.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Red is the color of Satan, so you&#39;re intuitively a good mom and <br/>\n  your child <br/>\n  &gt; will live forever.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Red sets up a vibration of agitation, but there is an aromatherapy <br/>\n  antidote.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Oh, thank you!&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;I&#39;m so glad I came here to discuss this!&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Yes, I love these deep, heartfelt discussions.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; I think when a person goes so far  as to take children out of <br/>\n  school AND they <br/>\n  &gt; reject the nicely packaged curriculum and traditional schedule and <br/>\n  behaviors <br/>\n  &gt; AND they have found unschooling.com (which I realize some on this <br/>\n  list still <br/>\n  &gt; have not, but it&#39;s there, nevertheless, and I hope it&#39;s listed on <br/>\n  the <br/>\n  &gt; yahoogroups main page for this list), they are probably ready to <br/>\n  REALLY <br/>\n  &gt; honestly discuss things of importance to their children&#39;s futures.  <br/>\n  And lots <br/>\n  &gt; of people here and on the forum are unhappy and scared and on the <br/>\n  verge of <br/>\n  &gt; giving up unschooling so they can&#39;t get it.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; We can be la-la supportive of bad ideas along with the good.  We <br/>\n  can send <br/>\n  &gt; them elsewhere for real information.  Or we can discuss issues and <br/>\n  compare <br/>\n  &gt; results and offer alternatives and options and we can brainstorm.  <br/>\n  Learning <br/>\n  &gt; doesn&#39;t take place as well in a still, quiet, near-sleep state as <br/>\n  it does in <br/>\n  &gt; a more active, aroused, alert state.  <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; If a person has NO new thoughts to think, no new phases for their <br/>\n  children to <br/>\n  &gt; pass through, no questions whatsoever about hobbies or resources or <br/>\n  &gt; unschooling practicalities, then they don&#39;t need the opinions they <br/>\n  can find <br/>\n  &gt; here.  Maybe they just came to chat.  If by chat they mean &quot;be <br/>\n  totally <br/>\n  &gt; supported and never questioned,&quot; they just came to the wrong list.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n  Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
