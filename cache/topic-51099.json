My problem was the pronunciation the teacher used. One word in a social studies class (4th grade) was &quot;deciduous&quot;, as in a tree. She pronounced the word &quot;dis-ig-ius&quot;. I spelled it as she said it and it was marked wrong. I checked the pronunciation in the book and the dictionary and she had said it wrong. But I was too chicken to say anything to her and I never mentioned it to my parents. <br/>\n<br/>\nChristina in GA<br/>\nHappiness comes through doors you<br/>\ndidn&#39;t even know you left open.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grlynbl@...\">grlynbl@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, December 09, 2002 8:01 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Writing/Spelling    To me, spelling is a big old waste of time.. Either you get it or you <br/>\n  dont.  My oldest son is a wonderful speller, its a natural gift to him.  He <br/>\n  has probably only had to &quot;look up&quot;10 words in his 16 years  He just knows <br/>\n  them, he visualizes them.  Yet, in school, he still had to write those dang <br/>\n  spelling words 5 times each every week.. UGHGHGHG.. My daughter had to study <br/>\n  her words for about 15 mins, maybe have me call them out to her once. She <br/>\n  made 100 on every spelling test she ever took.. BUT, when she writes, she <br/>\n  often misspells words.  She only memorized her spelling words for the test . <br/>\n  Ethan could study and write his words 50 times each, and on test day, he woud <br/>\n  still fail the test.  So, to me, in every case, spelling was a . WASTE of <br/>\n  time.   Sorry for the long rant,.. I do get wound up sometimes :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Teresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50967,"nextTopicId":51101}}
