Early one morning, I received a call from the doctor&#39;s<br/>\noffice to tell me that I had been rescheduled for earlier that morning  at<br/>\n9:30am..<br/>\n<br/>\n I had only just packed everyone off to work and school and it was already<br/>\naround 8:45 am. The trip to his office took about 35 minutes,  so I didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave any time to spare.<br/>\n<br/>\n As most women do, I like to take a little extra effort over hygiene when<br/>\nmaking such visits, but this time I wasn&#39;t going to be able to  make the<br/>\nfull effort. So, I rushed upstairs, threw off my pyjamas, wet  the washcloth<br/>\nthat was sitting next to the sink, and gave myself a quick wash in &quot;that<br/>\narea&quot; to make sure I was at least presentable. I  threw the washcloth in the<br/>\nclothes basket, donned some clothes, hopped  in the car and raced to my<br/>\nappointment.<br/>\n<br/>\n I was in the waiting room for only a few minutes when I was called in.<br/>\n<br/>\n Knowing the procedure, as I&#39;m sure you do, I hopped up on the table, looked<br/>\nover at the other side of the room and pretended that I was in Paris or some<br/>\nother place a million miles away. I was a little surprised when the doctor<br/>\nsaid, &quot;My, we have made an extra effort this morning haven&#39;t<br/>\nwe?&quot;..............I didn&#39;t respond.<br/>\n<br/>\n After the appointment, I heaved a sigh of relief and went home. The rest of<br/>\nthe day was normal....some shopping, cleaning, cooking, etc.  After school<br/>\nwhen my six year old daughter was playing, she called out from the bathroom,<br/>\n&quot;Mommy, where&#39;s my washcloth?&quot; I told her to get another one from the<br/>\ncupboard. She replied, &quot;No, I need the one that  was here by the sink, it<br/>\nhad all my glitter and sparkles in it.&quot;............<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63002,"nextTopicId":62983}}
