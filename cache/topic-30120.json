She will be getting a wand but<br/>\nunfortunately it won&#39;t have that magic power.  I had thought about<br/>\ngiving her a nice journal and a decorated pen so we could write down<br/>\nher stories about the imaginary places she&#39;s created and tell her that<br/>\nthe best way to visit those wonderful places is by reading and writing<br/>\nabout them.
