My 22 month old has<br/>\n&gt; croup again.  My other two children never had it and in my family I grew<br/>\n&gt; up in none of us ever had it, so I&#39;m not overly sure how to treat it.  I<br/>\n&gt; know about the steam and taking the child out into the cold air trick<br/>\n&gt; but this is summer so what do I do?  Also, when he&#39;s had it before (this<br/>\n&gt; might be his 4th episode), it&#39;s always happened at night and by day he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; fine.  This time it started at 8 this morning and is continuing through<br/>\n&gt; the day...is it going to get worse tonight yet?  He seems basically<br/>\n&gt; fine, is not breathing with great difficulty, just wheezing alot.  We<br/>\n&gt; all do have bad colds right now so it&#39;s extra tough for him breathing<br/>\n&gt; when he&#39;s so congested.  Any advice, information or tips please?  I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; appreciate anything anyone has to offer.  A friend in the past told me<br/>\n&gt; to try homeopathy and I did try a couple of doses this a.m. and it did<br/>\n&gt; not seem to help at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sonia<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Visit www.ibelieve.com  today and get a FREE book by Chuck Swindoll!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/963786121/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/963786121/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11237,"nextTopicId":11244}}
