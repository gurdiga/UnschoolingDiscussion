It looks as if my<br/>\nmother is going to have to leave the retirement home she&#39;s in.  The dementia<br/>\nhas progressed to hitting people.  At the least, she has to go for an<br/>\nassessment at Highline Hospital in Tukwilla.  I&#39;m going to have to go down<br/>\nsoon and sign her in there, then probably again when she gets out.  If we&#39;re<br/>\nlucky, and she stabilizes on some med or other, she&#39;ll be able to go back to<br/>\nwhere she&#39;s been living.  Otherwise, who knows?  Today she celebrated her<br/>\n87th birthday by being told she can&#39;t stay where she is, at least for now.<br/>\nLovely.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to hear back from anyone with any experience in this area.  I know<br/>\nmost of you are probably younger than me and have younger parents, but maybe<br/>\nsomeone will have some bit of info that would help me.  Helen, maybe this is<br/>\nsomething you&#39;ve had to deal with?  Actually anyone who has dealt with<br/>\nsenile dementia in a relative might have tips for me.  I&#39;m all ears.<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59350,"nextTopicId":59399}}
