I emailed and asked why they didn&#39;t title the story &quot;The Dark <br/>\nSide of Parenting.&quot; I believe the story said that they where not even complying <br/>\nwith the state laws. Not that it matters much but in this case there was a <br/>\nhistory and an abuse trail.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder though, what about the parents who spank when their children do not <br/>\ndo their work or well enough? I have seen this with traditional Christian <br/>\nHomeschoolers. Where is the line? Or the parent that spanks their child in the <br/>\nstore or beats them in the parking lot or worse behind closed doors where no one <br/>\nsees?<br/>\nI once herd a Mom tell her daughter as she sat on her lap that she (the Mom) <br/>\nliked her daughters hair. The daughter (age 8) said yeah especially when you <br/>\npull me across the room by my hair when you are mad.  I was visiting at their <br/>\nhome and sitting on the floor with my son. I pretended not to hear what she had <br/>\nsaid but I never forget that statement.  I wonder now what is a front and <br/>\nwhat is real.  I always looked at the family as if we lacked something they had. <br/>\nWe dont lack a thing that they have as their children may look happy but it is <br/>\nreally fear of the paddle, spoon, hand and shame that they practice.... Laura<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I also agree with some other posters.  These people were not <br/>\ntechnically homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82863,"nextTopicId":82919}}
