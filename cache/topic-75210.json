Sometimes it&#39;s pretty <br/>\nlonely in the Homeschooling world...t&#39;ain&#39;t many of us queer folks out there,<br/>\n and <br/>\ncertainly not many unschoolers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I don&#39;t understand. I think that the religious conservatives feel that if the doors are open to same sex marriage, it will just explode or something. But gay relationships are likely to be a minority, just as gay marriages would be.<br/>\nThe benefits of marriage are also overshadowed by the inconveniences of having to file for divorce if the couple doesn&#39;t want to continue the union. So there isn&#39;t a huge number of people using marriage just for the benefits I would guess.<br/>\nAnd if someone is going to &quot;use&quot; marriage laws strictly for their benefit, does it matter if they&#39;re gay or hetero? <br/>\n<br/>\nTrue story:<br/>\nI worked at a health club with a gay couple back in the early 90&#39;s. Both good looking and getting hit on by girls ALL the time. One of them married a girl that needed a green card really badly. So there was your opposite sex marriage that the religious folks are so approving of...but they all lived in the same house of course.<br/>\nMight as well let Tim and Philipe get married!!! That would actually have made sense. DUH.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75206,"nextTopicId":75118}}
