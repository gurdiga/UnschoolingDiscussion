The<br/>\n&gt; kids were now in college and I thought it was great that the one son<br/>\n&gt; mentioned the national homeschool basketball game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oveall, considering how anti-homeschooling the studio audience was, this<br/>\n&gt; was a good intro for them into homeschooling. I think if an unschooling<br/>\n&gt; family had been featured it would have been just so far out of the realm<br/>\n&gt; of possibilities to the mindset of the people there, they wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; been able to process it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So a door has been opened.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my response:<br/>\n<br/>\ni thought exactly the same thing (and we&#39;re unschoolers).  the families they<br/>\nchose were very good for an<br/>\nintroduction and an unschooling family or any discussion about child-led hs,<br/>\nimo, would have literal blow their<br/>\nminds.  i really felt the audience had reached their max in terms of being<br/>\nintroduced to &#39;new material&#39;.  but to be<br/>\nfair i think most hs&#39;ers (not all), particularly people who started hs after ps<br/>\nhad failed them, begin with<br/>\nschool-at-home and gradually relaxes as they bond more and learn to trust<br/>\nthemselves and their children.  imo,<br/>\nit&#39;s a natural process when acquiring a new skill and i believe hs is just<br/>\nthat, a new skill for both the parents and<br/>\nthe children.  all in all it was hopeful and i was not disappointed with<br/>\noprah&#39;s behavior and remarks (yes i did<br/>\ncatch her reaction i think hs is a &#39;culture shock&#39; for her but the nice thing<br/>\nis she&#39;s appeared open to it, which has<br/>\nnot always been the case for her)<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTrisha Sides wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;    I was just wondering, Did anyone else watch Oprah yesterday?
