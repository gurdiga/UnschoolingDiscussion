He was the<br/>\n&quot;sacrificial lamb&quot;, accepted this role, and did not try to flee or to<br/>\ndefend himself. Mel Gibson has stated that this is the reason it is<br/>\nHIS hand that was filmed pounding the first nail into Jesus&#39; palm,<br/>\nbecause he feels HE is as much to &quot;blame&quot; for the death as anyone.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a Christian radio station here handing out buttons that say &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\nresponsible&quot; as a way of explaining the culpability of all human kind that<br/>\nis central to Christian doctrine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for teens seeing it, like so many things, it depends entirely on the<br/>\nindividual and how sensitive a person s/he is.  A bunch of devout teens I<br/>\nknow are going as a group and plan to go somewhere afterward to talk about<br/>\nit.  Some of the kids in the group won&#39;t go.  Someone without a background<br/>\nin Bible may have lots of questions after seeing this very intense snapshot<br/>\nof the most painful moment in the Christian story.  Without context it will<br/>\njust seem like a gore-fest.  To me, it is an expression of the most Holy and<br/>\nloving God who became flesh to take the sins of the world on His own<br/>\nshoulders in order to reconcile us to Him.  For the Christian, it truly is a<br/>\nlove story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s more to say, but alas it has little to do with unschooling so I&#39;ll<br/>\nleave it at that.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Krisula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91659,"nextTopicId":91670}}
