My son <br/>\n(who the Q is about) is 8, and has two sisters, 5 and almost 2. I&#39;ve always <br/>\n(as in my whole life) thought it was beyond ridiculous that there were (for <br/>\ninstance) toys that boys were &quot;supposed&quot; to play with, and toys girls were <br/>\n&quot;supposed&quot; to play with. Needless to say (or maybe not since you don&#39;t know <br/>\nme), I&#39;ve ****never**** uttered one iota about any toy being for a specific <br/>\nperson. So, Ashlen (my son) has dolls and barbies (among lots of other <br/>\nstuff!!), and my daughters have cars and action figures (among lots of other <br/>\nstuff!!). If anyone ever (no one has so far) comes up to them and says that a <br/>\ntoy they&#39;re playing with is really for a girl/boy (whatever the case may be), <br/>\nthey&#39;d look at them un utter confusment, with a look of &quot;are you from mars or <br/>\nsomething&quot;. And this is a whole philosophy (not just something about toys), <br/>\nthat whatever interests you, interests you! Has nothing to do with gender <br/>\naround here. My square, old fashion in-laws, have never said anything, but I <br/>\ncould always &quot;read their minds&quot; when my son got a big ole doll for his <br/>\nbirthday, or when my daughter asked them for a huge Rescue Hero station for <br/>\nChristmas. (Etc, etc.....) (Something that&#39;s been very eye-opening to me is <br/>\nthat my son loves the *boy* toys way more often than the *girl* toys, and my <br/>\ndaughters -even the baby- like the *girl* toys way more often then the *boy* <br/>\ntoys! And many other so-called &quot;boy&quot; and &quot;girl&quot; things!! All without any <br/>\nutterance from anyone. There&#39;s a ***** definite ***** genetic thing going on <br/>\nhere!) Anyhooooooo, my son, in the last year or so has *noticed* that his <br/>\nsisters have dresses and skirts, and he doesn&#39;t, so I&#39;ve explained that girls <br/>\nusually wear them, and not boys. It was a bit strange to him to hear that the <br/>\nfirst time, because there had never before been anything that one sex was <br/>\nsupposed to do and not the other. Luckily, he really didn&#39;t care (meaning he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t ask for one). And I explained to him that even though it&#39;s silly, s<br/>\nociety has a tradition that some things are for boys, and some for girls. We <br/>\njust agreed it was silly. Also, he has long hair, and only just recently, did <br/>\nsomeone call him a girl (to his face), and he realized that long hair is <br/>\nusually a *girl* thing. Anyway, I&#39;m getting to my question, I really am!! <br/>\nJust want you to know where we&#39;re all coming from! The kids wear make up <br/>\naround the house whenever they feel like it (it&#39;s not very often though). <br/>\nThey have their own stash, and dress up &quot;fancy&quot; sometimes, with make up and <br/>\nfrilly play clothes. They&#39;ve asked before if they could wear make up &quot;out&quot; <br/>\ntoo, because that&#39;s what I do. But they didn&#39;t insist, and when I asked them <br/>\nif it was ok if they&#39;d please just wait till we got home, and then they <br/>\ncould, they said yea, and it was dropped. My son just asked again today. So <br/>\nmy question is; Should I just lump it (the looks and snares and maybe even <br/>\nsome comments that I&#39;ll get taking them into public), and just say &quot;OK&quot; the <br/>\nnext time I&#39;m asked, or; Do I keep doing what I&#39;m doing, since he/they really <br/>\naren&#39;t putting up a fight anyway about it, and say &quot;how about not, let&#39;s just <br/>\nwait till we get home&quot;?
