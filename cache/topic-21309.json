I&#39;ve been working diligently on my home<br/>\nbased business.<br/>\nThe homeschooling conference went great.  I attended two unschooling<br/>\nworkshops and one planning your own curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result has been that we block out at least 2 hours in the morning<br/>\nfor &quot;school&quot; and I don&#39;t answer the phone.  Of course &quot;school&quot; takes on<br/>\nmany forms.  We usually have 15 minute blocks of free play (mostly<br/>\nlegoes and cars).  I use a day planner frequently so I&#39;ve started my son<br/>\non one.  Basically it&#39;s an regular blank sheet of paper with 5 days of<br/>\nthe week blocked out.  I also have three codes that go next to tasks.<br/>\ncheck for task done, x for task deleted and arrow for task forwarded. My<br/>\nson has been interest in calendars and learning days of the week.  When<br/>\nwe are done with a task we simply check what is next.  We also list the<br/>\nnew things we have done and he chooses how to label it.   We saw some<br/>\nfolks measuring for a new street and he decided to call it work<br/>\nbuilders.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s decided he wants to continue to get &quot;Top Secret Adventures&quot; from<br/>\nHighlights.  I need to help him with it since it&#39;s designed for readers<br/>\nand he&#39;s really a pre-reader.  A couple of times the neighbor girl who<br/>\nis 9, schooled and a child of teachers came over to help him with it.<br/>\nShe was trying to get him to recognize sounds letters make.  She tried<br/>\nto get him to say the sound a &quot;B&quot; makes &quot;buh&quot;.  With a mischievous look<br/>\nin his eye, my son responded by saying bzzz.  That&#39;s the sound a &quot;B&quot;<br/>\nmakes.  He likes to make his letter S with a snake head,  he made his P,<br/>\npee and his B had wings.  When he wants his name to be said loudly he<br/>\nmakes the letters bigger.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it seems to working well.  We are holding him more accountable<br/>\nfor the things he wants to find out and reminding him what he said he<br/>\nwanted to do.  We are also encouraging follow through, including<br/>\nclean-up.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings and Success,<br/>\nSherry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21281,"nextTopicId":21407}}
