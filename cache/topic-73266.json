It&#39;s <br/>\ndefinately difficult on days that I can&#39;t walk or worse when I can&#39;t see and my <br/>\nequilibrium is off.  But overall I often tell people that I see it as a blessing <br/>\nin disguise. Not that I wouldn&#39;t trade my body in for a better model if given <br/>\nthe chance, but since that isn&#39;t gonna happen, we just deal day to day. I <br/>\nretired 5 years ago, following my back surgery and during such a trying time, it <br/>\ngave me an opportunity to look at my life in more of a big picture. DH and I <br/>\nhad already worked odd schedules so that the twins would never be in someone <br/>\nelses care. In 1996 I went thru 3 major operations in a row and a near death <br/>\nexperience. Talk about having to reflect. I went from an extremely <br/>\ntype-A/workaholic life, you know the type---&quot;If I make a ton of money I can <br/>\nbuy their happiness.&quot; to OMG, it could all be over in a split second, so I need <br/>\nto make each moment count. I went back to work, but very part time so that <br/>\nwhile the girls were in school, I could make a buck and be home when they were <br/>\nhome. Somethow though that still wasn&#39;t working. I was a litteral walking (half <br/>\nslumped over like an 80 year old) zombie and was of no good to them, at least <br/>\nthe way I knew I was supposed to be. Then came the back surgery and that made <br/>\nme reflect even more. I was told that more children were not an option and <br/>\nthat without the surgery, my legs would be done working within 6 months. So I <br/>\nwent for the surgery and what do you know, I found homeschooling that wasn&#39;t <br/>\nbased on the religious right, which I had been under the perception was the only <br/>\nway it existed. As I continued to research, I found Unschooling.com and found <br/>\nout everything I was craving was in fact valid and could be done if one was <br/>\nwilling to change their POV from that which we are taught as the norm. <br/>\n<br/>\nWow, I started typing and ended up with a small novel. I never even answered <br/>\nyour question. Sorry. I guess I would say that Kass & Kree are very aware and <br/>\nsensitive to my plight. There are times like most recently when they have <br/>\nsmall break downs. I think this is due to the combination of their raging 11 year <br/>\nold hormones and seeing me go thru a really trying time. I&#39;d also say they are <br/>\nvery considerate and compassionate. There are things that DH and I have <br/>\nchosen not to discuss with them until it&#39;s absolutely necessary. There is no need <br/>\nfor their little hearts and minds to worry, especially with things that aren&#39;t <br/>\nfixable or currently have no answers for. Did that even make sense? Perhaps <br/>\nI&#39;m just babbling now. But I will say that when I recently posted about Kass <br/>\nbeing hateful last Sunday, when she came back in to apologize, she specified that <br/>\nsometimes she just gets so angry because it&#39;s not fair that I can&#39;t do a lot <br/>\nof stuff that I used to and she wishes it would go away. That was definately a <br/>\ncatch 22 moment. I understand her frustration, since I myself feel <br/>\nfrustrated, but by the same token, I am grateful for all that it has brought to our <br/>\nlives. Ultimately, I think they will be better human beings for it and that is all <br/>\nI really want for them. It also gives us reason to discuss things such as the <br/>\nafterlife and what I think about love, life and the universe. These are not <br/>\nthings they&#39;d get from school and I wonder how much time we would spend <br/>\ndiscussing such things if our lives hadn&#39;t been turned upside down by it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if I wore out anyones eyes, I didn&#39;t know I would share so much myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":106031689,"authorName":"Jon and Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"jonkream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom]Underwater world at Mall of America","postDate":"1055384278","msgId":73765,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxOTMwMWMzMzA4OCRkODIzMTg1MCQ2NDAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFkNS5iNmQ0NWZhLjJjMTkzMzc1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":73756,"nextInTopic":73786,"prevInTime":73764,"nextInTime":73766,"topicId":73266,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Rhonda - I absolutely think fms has given me a chance to understand what s important and what s not.
