He is learning and enjoying<br/>\n- not having any kind of trouble in the classroom.  Many people close to<br/>\nus had &quot;worried&quot; about how he would adapt to a classroom situation<br/>\nbecause he is fairly high energy, and challenges adult authority often<br/>\nand vehemently.  My dh and I have learned alternative ways of looking at<br/>\nhis &quot;challenging&quot; behavior(s), but of course, older relatives (old<br/>\nschool kinds), are sure that we are destined for problems by allowing<br/>\nhim so much freedom, and were sure that he would have difficulty<br/>\nadjusting to the classroom situations.  There have been some outbursts<br/>\n*at home* because of emotions being bottled up at school during the<br/>\nday.  Going to school was completely his choice, and it seems that he is<br/>\nwilling to put up with all the garbage to be there.  When he comes home,<br/>\nhe is able to let loose.  Not really fun for us, but I think we have<br/>\ndone a decent job of supporting his outbursts at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway....I don&#39;t feel that Zachary has really been pushed to learn<br/>\nvery much while in Kindergarten, although he has been *told* what to do<br/>\nand when.
