My daughter has expressed interest in learning the <br/>\nviolin, and there&#39;s a homeschooling Suzuki teacher in our group that <br/>\nI&#39;ve talked to about violin. DH took the kids to the vaudeville show <br/>\nafter they said they wanted to go, and when I met them there, the <br/>\nfirst thing my daughter said is &quot;I want to play just like that <br/>\nwoman.&quot; I pretty much knew it would be something that would really <br/>\nappeal to her, but whether or not she wanted to go, and whether or <br/>\nnot she came to that conclusion were totally up to her. I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave had a problem with it if she *hadn&#39;t* been interested in the <br/>\nfiddle player, but I thought she might be, so I presented the <br/>\nopportunity<br/>\n<br/>\nI was baking yeast bread and I asked if the kids wanted to help (they <br/>\nusually do, with baking). As we emptied the yeast in, I told them <br/>\nwhat its purpose was. My son was immediately interested in how, <br/>\nexactly, it worked. I didn&#39;t have all the answers, so as soon as the <br/>\nbread started rising we logged onto www.howstuffworks.com and found a <br/>\ngood explanation plus three experiments with yeast. We read about how <br/>\nit worked and did the experiments. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know my son loves any kind of science and experiments, and I often <br/>\nthink like that too, so sometimes I just do my thinking aloud, and if <br/>\nhe&#39;s interested in a subject, we do it together. Like today, the <br/>\nsalad dressing that I like to make up had been in the refridgerator. <br/>\nWhen I took it out, the olive oil had congealed into a fat layer on <br/>\ntop of the vinegary layer. So I just mentioned that I noticed it was <br/>\ncongealed, and he was interested in that and why it happened. I told <br/>\nhim I thought if I set it in a patch of sunlight it would melt <br/>\nfaster. He suggested dividing it into two portions and setting one in <br/>\nsun and one in shade to see if I was right (funny to hear a 6 y.o. <br/>\nchanting &quot;Test your hypothesis, MOM!&quot;) and so we had a mini <br/>\nexperiment to see if warmer temperatures converted a solid fat to a <br/>\nliquid faster. Now I&#39;m sure he doesn&#39;t think of it in those terms, <br/>\nand neither did I try to make it into a science lesson, we just <br/>\nwanted to see which would melt faster so I could have my salad.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is interested in Legos, Bionicles, and Lego Mindstorms. I <br/>\nnoticed an article in the newspaper about some local students making <br/>\nLego Mindstorm creations, and kept it out to read to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of times I just listen to their musings or thoughts or ideas, <br/>\ntrying to give them my full attention. Attention is a gift that us <br/>\nbusy parents sometimes don&#39;t give enough of. I have to consciously <br/>\nfight listening to my own mind thinking about all the stuff I have to <br/>\ndo, versus really listening to my kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to the zoo yesterday, and we were standing at the Sea Lion <br/>\ntank. While all the kids ooohed and aaahed as the big sea lions swam <br/>\npast, my son was watching them intently. After about a minute or so, <br/>\nhe turned to me and said &quot;The bigger sea lion is swimming in a <br/>\npattern - over this way, then down there, then back across. The <br/>\nsmaller sea lion is swimming in a different pattern. The patterns <br/>\ndon&#39;t take up the same amount of time, so they cross at different <br/>\nplaces.&quot; I&#39;m constantly amazed by the *different* way that he looks <br/>\nat the world. He has a very mathematical brain - finding patterns in <br/>\nstuff that most of us just see. If I was just half-listening to him <br/>\nwhile trying to urge the kids onward to the penguin house, I would&#39;ve <br/>\nmissed this incredible observation. It&#39;s just being fully *present* <br/>\nfor those moments, those little clues that our kids give to the way <br/>\nthey think, that really helps us tune in to what they might be <br/>\ninterested in. But it&#39;s not always easy!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My son is a cautious pessimist, which he gets from me both <br/>\n </span></blockquote>genetically<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and by modeling.  (oops). <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Funny, I just wrote an article about how kids learn by example, and <br/>\none of the best examples we can teach by example is how to fail - how <br/>\nto get frustrated and overcome it (I&#39;m trying to get it published in <br/>\nprint, otherwise I&#39;d post it here). My son used to be such a <br/>\nperfectionist, and I had to realize that most of it came from my <br/>\nexample. Once he started seeing me do things that I struggled with, <br/>\nand I shared my struggles with him (which is important, because often <br/>\nkids don&#39;t *see* that we struggle too), he started being much less <br/>\nfrustrated with himself when he made mistakes. As unschooling <br/>\nparents, the only sure way that we do any &quot;teaching&quot; at all is by <br/>\nexample, and we do that whether the examples we set are things we <br/>\nwant our kids to do or not. So it&#39;s even more imperative that we try <br/>\nto change ourselves! Much harder than to just assume we can change <br/>\nour kids, which is the common assumption in our culture (usually <br/>\nthrough threats and bribes and the old &quot;do as I say, not as I do&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He&#39;s never been in school, but reacts<br/>\n&gt; negatively to any kind of coaxing.

Sometimes it&#39;s hard to know<br/>\n&gt; what his interests are, because he&#39;s so &quot;inwards&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;m sure that must be much harder. Both of my kids never stop <br/>\ntalking, so I know just about every thought that crosses their minds. <br/>\nI think it would definitely take more effort on the parent&#39;s part <br/>\nwith a kid who is more inwards. But most people react negatively to <br/>\ncoaxing, whether they show it overtly or not.

I also have a time each night with each of <br/>\nmy kids set aside to talk with them and listen to whatever they want <br/>\nto talk about - in the dark, I lie down with each of them in bed, and <br/>\nwe stare up at the glow-in-the-dark ceiling stars and talk. Usually <br/>\nwe start out talking about our day, but that often branches out into <br/>\nmany different things. I&#39;ve been really amazed by the things they&#39;ve <br/>\nrevealed to me during this time. I think it helps that I don&#39;t really <br/>\nhave an agenda, and with the darkness it&#39;s very informal and I&#39;m not <br/>\ngrilling them or anything. That&#39;s just what works for me, anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (It did help me to stop waiting for him to be interested in school<br/>\n&gt; subjects like ancient history, or geology, and to comprehend that<br/>\n&gt; Pokemon *is* an interest.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know what you mean. Unschooling ourselves is the biggest challenge <br/>\nwe parents face. Just the idea of &quot;subjects&quot; is limiting. There&#39;s <br/>\njust a big world, and dividing it up into areas is not all that <br/>\nuseful.

Again, this is that fine line.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelli<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So my kids have interests...let&#39;s take my 9 year old son for <br/>\n </span></blockquote>example. He likes rocks. He has collected them since he was little. <br/>\nSince this is something he is interested in, what exactly do I do <br/>\nnow? I am waiting for our library to get a book about experiments <br/>\nwith rocks (it is checked out at the time). He doesn&#39;t seem <br/>\ninterested in reading books about rocks really because most of these <br/>\nare too encyclopedia-like to catch his interest. When it warms up, I <br/>\nplan on taking him rock hunting. Is this along the lines of what I am <br/>\nsupposed to be &quot;doing&quot; as an unschooling parent?  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow much does he really want to get into rocks?  Does he really want <br/>\nto learn geology facts or does he just want to find cool rocks and <br/>\nput them in containers?  Does he want to do experiments with rocks?  <br/>\nI would probably get the book from the library, show it to him, and <br/>\nwait to see if he does anything with it.  I wouldn&#39;t say, &quot;Hey, come <br/>\ndo an experiment with me&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne time after a homeopathy appointment my kids and I went past this <br/>\nreally cool looking park.  We didn&#39;t have time to stop that morning, <br/>\nbut I knew we would after the next appointment.  It was a perfect <br/>\nday.  We had a picnic, we watched ducks and swans, played on swings, <br/>\nand played in a stream.  We took a walk to see where the stream ended <br/>\nup, and found that it emptied into a bigger &quot;stream&quot; that looked like <br/>\nthe beginning of a river.  My kids asked me which river it was, and I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t sure.  We went home and I looked it up on the map.  I told <br/>\nthem the name of the river that it emptied into (in the same town).  <br/>\nI pointed out other towns we had been in that had parts of the same <br/>\nriver in them.  They thought that was cool.  I thought...Ooh, <br/>\nsomething they&#39;re interested in.  And instead of just enjoying the <br/>\nmemory of that incredibly fun day at the park and simply answering <br/>\ntheir simple question, I tried to turn it into this big thing.  I <br/>\nfound the name of the town in New York where the stream started as a <br/>\nlake and found a neat looking hotel there. I told them we could play <br/>\non the beach of the lake there.  I found the name of the town in <br/>\nMaryland where the river emptied in the Chesapeake.  I found they had <br/>\nboat tours there.  I ordered a big wall map from Chesapeake water <br/>\nalliance and planned on putting stickers on every part of the river <br/>\nthat we visited.  I ordered several interlibrary loan books on rivers <br/>\nand salmon swimming from oceans to rivers to lay their eggs.  I was <br/>\nshowing my daughter the hotels I was considering and discussing some <br/>\nof the plans with her and noticed that she seemed less than <br/>\nenthusiastic.  I said something like, &quot;Aren&#39;t you interested in going <br/>\nhere?&quot;  And she said, &quot;Well, not really, but I&#39;ll go with you if you <br/>\nwant to go&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen it hit me.  They had a fun day at the park and asked one little <br/>\nquestion about a stream and I went NUTS! lol  It would have been a <br/>\ncool project to do if they really, REALLY were into it.  But they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t care about rivers THAT much. lol  I was unschooling but <br/>\nsomewhere in the back of my mind I was waiting for them to get into <br/>\nthis academically-impressive project that would impress all the <br/>\nunschooling doubters I know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that not everything has to be a project that resembles a <br/>\nunit study.  They don&#39;t have to have interests that resemble school <br/>\nin any way.  Nothing they do with their day has to easily fall into <br/>\nany academic subject.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Other than this, for the last couple of weeks, I have just had <br/>\n </span></blockquote>books laying around...they are still where I have left them.

If they don&#39;t, it&#39;s their fault.  I was here a few <br/>\nyears ago and couldn&#39;t believe that my relaxed unit studies plus a <br/>\nlittle math wasn&#39;t being considered unschooling. &lt;grin&gt;  It took me a <br/>\nlot to &quot;get&quot; that.  I stayed for quite awhile, left still not <br/>\ncompletely getting it, digested it for a few months, and then came <br/>\nback ready for more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so glad that there were people here ready to challenge just about <br/>\nevery school idea I had.

I have been feeling sick most of the day and I feel bad about being testy too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m responding from a personal point of view, even though I&#39;m assuming much of your post was meant as a general post and not about any one person here.<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n  So many times I have read your posts Sandra, and most of the time it makes sense.  Other times I have to think about it for awhile before it makes sense, and sometimes it just doesn&#39;t make sense,  but I keep coming back hoping that at some point it will.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If it seems like I am arguing it is only because I *want* it to make sense.  If I question something or ask for more examples from you or others here, its because I&#39;m trying to see it from different angles, hoping to find one that makes sense.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sometimes I won&#39;t get it all right away, but I am sure that I *will* get it if I keep looking at it, keep thinking about it, and keep reading and asking questions about it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is true, your name is a well known name in &quot;unschooling&quot; circles.  That is why, when I have a question, particularly about unschooling, that I turn to you or others here.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I could research lots of information but there are not very many places where I can get accurate information about it.  And I&#39;ve already read the Unschooling.com message boards to the point of exhaustion.  I have also read Holt...in fact I&#39;m re-reading &quot;How Children Fail&quot; as I write. <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n  There *are* others who define unschooling differently and I completely understand that you want to defend the term unschooling against imposters.  So, out of respect for you and the others here, I come *here* to ask my unschooling questions. I don&#39;t want to research unschooling somewhere else, for the very reason that there *are* others that define unschooling differently than it is defined here.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I also don&#39;t want to leave here and try to apply something I didn&#39;t fully understand from this list.  That would be an injustice to a viable educational philosophy.   There are times when I can be &quot;put off&quot; by what has been said, either here or at the boards, but I keep coming back.  For some reason I won&#39;t just &quot;dismiss&quot; information just because I don&#39;t always like the way it is presented.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I would never hold you responsible for the decisions I make.

I left them alone for twelve years, <br/>\nand now I want you to tell me which college they can get into and how much <br/>\nit&#39;s going to cost and how I should make their transcripts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI worry about people who don&#39;t want to pay for a curriculum and do the work <br/>\nto go through all that, but they somehow at some point want unschooling given <br/>\nto them the way a currciulum gives lessons to the families who plunk down the <br/>\nmoney for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone doesn&#39;t want to change their own personal way of seeing the world <br/>\nof learning, I don&#39;t see how unschooling will work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not my personal problem.  Not usually.<br/>\nSome moments when someone&#39;s angry because they&#39;ve wanted magical learning to <br/>\ntake place while they ignored the kids it seems my problem when they&#39;re <br/>\nsaying &quot;You said...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd will it be my personal problem when my name comes up somewhere, someday <br/>\nwhen someone&#39;s trying to defend their doing nothing as unschooling? <br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if Mary Griffith worries about that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58334,"nextTopicId":58387}}
