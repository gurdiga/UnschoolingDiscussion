I think that naturally our bodies are meant&nbsp;to flourish \n&amp; be healthy, in&nbsp; just about every environment known to man, with a \nfair distribution of resources.&nbsp; Now let&#39;s just say, as a hypothesis that \nwhen under undue or unchangeable stress the body acts in such a way that&nbsp; \ndefenses&nbsp;are put out into the bodies system, and that one of those defenses \njust happens to be fertility for the survival of the species. A NAtural \noccurance.&nbsp; If this were the case which I believe it IS.&nbsp; Over \npopulation would be a lessening factor in our Equal HUman RIght s struggle, \nbecause the &quot;evening&quot; of resources would allow for &quot;ALL&quot; people to have a fair , \nhealthy &amp; interchangeable relationship with our Homes, the Earth.&nbsp; I \nbelieve this the planet we live on is actually like the garden of Eden, \neverything, that each spirit-(&amp;)-body that exists here needs to survive \n&amp; flourish , there are resources for a sustainable living &amp; path of the \ncreature...we only have too many greedy bodies, taking too much from the rest of \nthe folks.&nbsp;</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;Abortion is such a touchy and deep subject, I \ndo not believe &quot;spiritually&quot; that anyone can make a definitive &quot;logical&quot; \ndenomination from never having such an experience.&nbsp; You would need to walk \nin the shoes of the person on the road you condemn, before you would know if \nthey were truly wrong unto themselves, and unto that which they were learning in \nthis lifetime......who are we to judge.(in other words)&nbsp; Ofcourse there is \nwhat I would feel to be an abuse, when it come to abortion, but will I place \nmyself in the seat of Judgement to inflict my place in truth on someone \nelse?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Truth is found only within, not without, and even if I \ntried to place&nbsp; judgement upon someone else it would not affect their truth \nwithin themselves, any more, than taking them farther from there own , by \ndefense.&nbsp; Death is crucial, and an integral part of experience in \nlife.&nbsp; ALl species are affected by it..no one is spared.&nbsp; So I do what \nis most beneficial to my own survival, &amp; that of my family, &amp; being in \ntune with rythms of the natural world are the most trustworthy ways,&nbsp;&quot;I&quot; \nhave found.&nbsp; It is all we truly have to rely on that is true to itself, \ntrue to it&#39;s surroudings, true to the future &amp; the past......it is a weave \nof many different experiences, and we should honor all stages of it, for my \nexperiences are based in my life..and them in there&#39;s .&nbsp; Ofcourse it is \nnatural for us to move away from or remove ourselves from experiences we find to \nbe inadequate or unaccepteable based on our feelings...that is just as \nnatural.&nbsp; But I &quot;personally &quot; try&nbsp; to recognize something just as it \nis,why base my beliefs for fear I will be like it or condone \nit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Honoring everything in it&#39;s place allows me to justify even more \nclearly why I do not want something in my lifeor teaches me ther is more&nbsp;to \nlearn here.&nbsp; ANd makes actions I do not think are conducive to my growth, \nmore &quot; recognizeable&quot; allowing me to more easily avoid them.&nbsp; But on those \nperchance meetings , out of the blue, well, I honor them, I donot , or at least \nI try not to &quot;JUDGE&quot; them, for that is not my place.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am hear to \nlearn &amp; teach .......there is so much to learn &amp; \nteach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle*</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11981,"nextTopicId":12025}}
