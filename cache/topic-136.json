This torture went on for weeks.  He<br/>\nwas about the age of your son, or a little older.  I was reading and<br/>\ncomposing poetry by five, so they thought there was something wrong with<br/>\nhim.  But my brother is just the type of person who likes to be cautious<br/>\nand takes things all in his own time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is very much like my one year old, who is very analytical and technical<br/>\nin his play style, yet very emotionally sensitive.  That summer we took a<br/>\ncar trip and my parents were reading Last of the Mohicans aloud to us, to<br/>\npass the time on the road.  My father reached a key passage in the book and<br/>\nthen passed it to my brother saying, &quot;Here Neil, it&#39;s your turn to read...&quot;<br/>\n He picked it up and dove right in to the story, and has never looked back.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is now a voracious reader and loves highly technical Science Fiction<br/>\nnovels.  He must have devoured thousands more books than me, although I am<br/>\nalso an avid reader.  I just can&#39;t keep up with him.  He also spent four<br/>\nyears in the Navy as a &quot;tech&quot; working on the electronic and computer<br/>\nsystems on Viking Jets, and he now manages a retail computer software store.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot bad, for the &quot;poor little third grader&quot; who couldn&#39;t read.  Your son<br/>\nwill come around, in his own good time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":183,"nextTopicId":503}}
