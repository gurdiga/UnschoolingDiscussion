We do not use grades, teachers &quot;loop&quot; for several years with the same kids, and everything we do is hands-on, experiential learning.  We&#39;re very close to the Sudbury School model.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 3 kids myself-- 8, 5 and almost 2-- and seriously thought I would homeschool my oldest when she neared school-age.  Unfortunately, my husband&#39;s loss of a job necessitated me returning to teaching.  When I first considered homeschooling, I thought I&#39;d definitely unschool.  I&#39;ve been pleased with our school&#39;s emphasis on student-directed learning (reading/writing workshop, science inquiries), but am still interested in unschooling-- even as a teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can say from my own experience that there are many kids who can&#39;t be unschooled-- either because of family situations or because of lack of parental willingness.  My goal is to move as close towards true unschooling as I can for these kids so that their needs and interests are respected even IF they are in a non-traditional public school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope no one minds my joining the list.  I know I represent the &quot;mainstream schooling&quot; faction, but even as a public school teacher,  unschooling seems to me to make the most sense.  I hope I&#39;m moving toward that in my classroom.  I&#39;m also hoping to gain insight and experiemce from all of you about home schooling & to see where I can change my approach in my classroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~ Teresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52787,"nextTopicId":52890}}
