I actually went to the ER 3 times with<br/>\n&gt; abdominal pain and a fever and was SENT HOME. By some chance the appendix<br/>\n&gt; actually burst on my third visit which landed me in surgery. Am anticipating<br/>\n&gt; separate $50 co-pays for each ER visit. :(<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Make a complaint (in person!) to the Patient Representative at the hospital.<br/>\nPresent your bills for the 3 seperate co-pays.  Tell them that you are happy<br/>\nto pay for the 3rd one, since that&#39;s the time that you got the care you<br/>\nneeded.  Ask them to waive the $100 that will remain on your account after<br/>\ninsurance pays, since it&#39;s the hospital&#39;s fault that your issue was not<br/>\nproperly diagnosed on the first visit.  Imply that if they do waive that<br/>\n$100, you will cheerily go on your way and not press the issue.  If the<br/>\nfirst person you talk to can&#39;t help you, work your way up the chain.<br/>\nSomewhere there will likely be someone who sees the light and realizes that<br/>\nyou might have a really valid complaint about misdiagnosis and $100 is a<br/>\npretty small amount to write off to make you go away.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\n(I deal with army contracters.  I&#39;ve gotten really good at complaining!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54356,"nextTopicId":54363}}
