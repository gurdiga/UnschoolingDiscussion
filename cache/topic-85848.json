REally?<br/>\nWe can guide, we can mentor, we can advise and assist and model....in the end we do not, can not control another human being. Those that believe they can are lying to themselves. And control by fear is the very least effective long term...oh, it seems to work, but all it does is create less communication and more sneakiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother talked very openly about sex, to a point. She also said that she hoped we would wait for marriage to begin a sexual relationship but if we didn&#39;t, she hoped we would use birth control. Knowing how they felt about other topics made us QUITE sure there was no way in hell we could admit we were having sex to them. They shut down effective communication quite well, and yet believed their kids could talk to them about anything. PPPFFFTTT! Yeah, right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had sex with two different partners in High school, both of whom I cared deeply for. I was pregnant with Trevor when dh and I got married (I was 20) and never told them until we had moved far away and the wedding was long over. Sad. That&#39;s what happens when parents are not calm and contemplative and non-reactionary over their children&#39;s behavior. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that someone is using the term &quot;rebellious&quot; tells me a lot about parenting style. My children don&#39;t need to &quot;rebel&quot;, they do need to be themselves though. If I&#39;m not setting up our lives to where I&#39;m being their adversary, or trying to control them, what is there to rebel against? They speak their minds, sometimes we disagree, but as far as extreme behavior...why? Why would they need to do something extreme? And I don&#39;t see sex as extreme, I see certain behaviors as extreme. <br/>\nIn medieval times, in certain cultures, 14y.o. girls were getting married. THere are cultures today in which it is common for teen girls to get married, have sex and have babies. So is it truly extreme and dangerous for teens to have sex? Or is it partly culture, partly religion that views this as extreme? I think healthy attitudes towards sex and a good heap of self confidence are more important than WHEN sex begins.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162967824,"authorName":"Dawn Adams","from":"&quot;Dawn Adams&quot; &lt;Wishbone@...&gt;","profile":"bluenosegoddess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Sexuality","postDate":"1070995680","msgId":85922,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzEwMWMzYmU4NCRmODkyM2RjMCQ4NzRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDUuMi4wLjkuMC4yMDAzMTIwODA4MTc1NS4wMGEyMGFiMEBycnYubmV0PiA8MDQxQTNERjYtMjlBNy0xMUQ4LUIwMzktMDAwMzkzQTVEQTY2QGNvbWNhc3QubmV0PiA8MjAwMzEyMDgyMzA1LjAwMTI0LmpveWZ1bGxpZmVAbXd0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":85917,"nextInTopic":85927,"prevInTime":85921,"nextInTime":85923,"topicId":85848,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I went out with the 3 little ones today.<br/>\nWe just went to Target. I was looking for long pants to fit them. I know the<br/>\ncold weather will hit and they will pantless! They also wanted gloves.<br/>\nAnyway, even though the store was crowded, we all managed well. We had a<br/>\ngood time. So we go to check out and Joseph wanted to see the YuGiOh cards<br/>\nwhich are right by a check out lane. One guy came by with his cart and just<br/>\nyelled at the kids to get out of the way yelling to them &quot;kids, move, c&#39;mon<br/>\nyou kids, get out of the way!&quot; Well it didn&#39;t take but a second for me to<br/>\ntell him that wasn&#39;t a very nice way to say excuse me along with a look that<br/>\nwould kill. I know I used the word rude in there somewhere too. His wife<br/>\nsheepishly followed behind him and apologized to me and the kids. Then when<br/>\nwe were checking out, the check out lady in the next aisle commented about<br/>\nAlyssa wanting candy. I asked Alyssa that didn&#39;t she still have the Nestle<br/>\ncrunch she got the other day. She ate about half. The lady told me to eat it<br/>\nmyself and then she&#39;ll not leave it next time. Yeah lady, that&#39;s a good<br/>\nidea. So I was saying candy is no big deal in our house as it&#39;s always there<br/>\nand they have no need to eat it all. Then she started on about how she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t allow her son any candy at all. She said that she was severely<br/>\nrestictive with him. This is the same lady who told me to eat my kids<br/>\ncandy!!!! Well I had some words for her, I wasn&#39;t nasty but not really nice.<br/>\nShe pissed me off by butting in on whether my kids should have candy or not.<br/>\nI guess maybe that&#39;s abusive in her eyes.

GOOD <br/>\nIDEA!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as of December 2003, he is not &quot;sexually active.&quot;  He might have lost his <br/>\nvirginity nearly a year ago, or possibly not quite.  If that had awakened a <br/>\ncrazy urge in him, he has opportunity, female friends, a driver&#39;s license, all <br/>\nof that.  Yet he doesn&#39;t maintain much flirtation.  He went out a couple of t<br/>\nimes (not date-like, high school &quot;date&quot; style, but to a movie, to eat, to hang <br/>\nout) with a girl who has made clear for years that any time Kirby wants a girl <br/>\nfriend and doesn&#39;t have one she wants the job.   He went to her apartment, <br/>\nwhere she was living alone.  They watched a movie and he drove home.  She came <br/>\ntoo, in her car, because he wanted to bring the van back ( I didn&#39;t make him, <br/>\nnor even call a time he should be home), but they still wanted to hang out.  <br/>\nThey hung out at our house, lots of lights on, playing board games or cards with <br/>\nHolly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the most recent date of a teenager at my house.  Not &quot;sexual activity.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&quot;Teen&quot; is a modern concept, and one artificially invented in <br/>\npost-industrial revolutionary times ....&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way, maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in Europe the ages 18 (in France) and 21 (in England) have had <br/>\nsignificance in the past as the ages at which young men who were destined to be knights <br/>\nwere knighted.  So the idea of those birthdays as hallmarks of something or <br/>\nother are not new.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as to marriage, there are also periods in history in which girls didn&#39;t <br/>\nmarry boys their own age.  Teenaged girls &quot;of society&quot; more likely married <br/>\nolder men (late 20&#39;s, 30&#39;s) who had finished their education, had their business <br/>\nsteadily going, and had a house.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong other classes, teenagers might be off and running at their own <br/>\napprenticeships or real work long before 18.  They were sailors or bakers or whatever, <br/>\nat least at apprentice level, whether for their dads or someone who would <br/>\ntake them to train them (to have cheap labor) and that was the end of their being <br/>\nat home with their parents.  Fourteen or fifteen years old.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still think the suggestion that parents who allow kids to play &quot;violent <br/>\nvideo games&quot; are inviting or condoning &quot;extreme behavior&quot; sounds like the <br/>\nsuggestion of a mother with little children, not teens.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162967824,"authorName":"Dawn Adams","from":"&quot;Dawn Adams&quot; &lt;Wishbone@...&gt;","profile":"bluenosegoddess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] extreme behavior","postDate":"1070909230","msgId":85861,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDcwMWMzYmRiYiRiMGU0NmQwMCQ2NTRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDUuMi4wLjkuMC4yMDAzMTIwODA4MTc1NS4wMGEyMGFiMEBycnYubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":85860,"nextInTopic":85867,"prevInTime":85860,"nextInTime":85862,"topicId":85848,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
