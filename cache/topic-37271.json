BUT this particular statement from the MODERATOR surprised and shocked me.  For someone who is supposedly trying to *keep the peace* (so to speak)on this list, which I&#39;m sure at times is trying to say the least, this statement seemed to be trying to stir up unrest(and I&#39;m sure it was a success).  Sandra may always be RIGHT, as you said, but Sandra is also downright RUDE in her comments sometimes.  Nomatter how RIGHT someone is, that is hard to digest.  Especially when it seems the moderator supports and encourages her. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Betty<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  (a copy of this message has been sent to the Unschooling-dotcom moderators<br/>\n  list)<br/>\n<br/>\n  ======== The posts from the thread this conversation refers to ========<br/>\n<br/>\n  on 5/23/02 1:41 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dbatiste7@...\">dbatiste7@...</a> at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dbatiste7@...\">dbatiste7@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; Great ideas.

She had never taken a<br/>\n  &gt; test in her life, nor written an essay.  After writing several essays and<br/>\n  &gt; getting them critiqued by an English teacher, she got 96%.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; If they want to do the thing they have to take the test for, they can learn<br/>\n  &gt; how to take tests.  It&#39;s a skill that can be learned any time.  In fact I<br/>\n  &gt; learned more about test-taking from my grade 7 art teacher than anywhere else.<br/>\n  &gt; She taught us lots of little hints like: Look over the whole test first.  See<br/>\n  &gt; where the harder and easier parts are. Do all the easier questions first, then<br/>\n  &gt; do the harder ones. Unless you&#39;re actually penalized more for a wrong answer,<br/>\n  &gt; guess the ones you don&#39;t know.

It&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt; only the artificial reproduction of them in schools that doesn&#39;t exist in real<br/>\n  &gt; life.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Before you asked for ideas on helping a child learn the sounds of the<br/>\n  &gt; alphabet. But if you look at your older kids, was grasping that so difficult<br/>\n  &gt; for them? The sounds *are* there in real life. If they weren&#39;t, then why would<br/>\n  &gt; we learn them (formally or informally). It&#39;s useful to walk so kids walk. It&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt; useful to talk so kids talk. The sounds the letters make are useful for<br/>\n  &gt; figuring out what the on screen commands in a video game mean (among loads of<br/>\n  &gt; other things!) so kids figure them out. ;-)<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; As people said, tests are a part of life. Our mouths will pass or fail us on<br/>\n  &gt; how well we&#39;ve read directions or a recipe. ;-) Tests are also part of real<br/>\n  &gt; games people do just for fun. Video games, logic games, crossword puzzles,<br/>\n  &gt; computer games, personality quizzes and so on.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; I think the one lesson about tests that kids don&#39;t need is that their entire<br/>\n  &gt; future is riding on how well they do. That&#39;s a way too prominent message in<br/>\n  &gt; school and kids are having tests thrown at them every which way. If your kids<br/>\n  &gt; want to take the SATs and know there&#39;s books and software and classes to<br/>\n  &gt; familiarize them with the style if they feel it&#39;s necessary and they know they<br/>\n  &gt; can take it as many times as they want (as far as I know!), then it&#39;s not a<br/>\n  &gt; big deal.

Funny thing<br/>\nis that over the 8 years that I&#39;ve been reading Sandra¹s writing, every time<br/>\nI think she might be remembering wrong and I go back and check, darned if<br/>\nshe isn&#39;t right.

I<br/>\nam not clear how it is that anyone thinks that all jobs do not &quot;test&quot; the<br/>\njob-holder.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Me: Not meaning to insult Kate since she was merely being honest in<br/>\nadmitting having missed the beginning of the thread. It¹s just to show that<br/>\nthere was at least one person who said she hadn&#39;t read everything.]<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget: Just because it isn&#39;t a paper and pencil quiz, doesn;t mean it<br/>\nisn&#39;t a test.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra: The original question was about giving paper and pencil tests to<br/>\nkids to prepare for all those &lt;exaggerated amount of&gt; required paper and<br/>\npencil tests which will &lt;not&gt; barrage people in life.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Me: one might argue that Dee did not say &quot;pencil and paper tests&quot; but the<br/>\nexamples she gave: &quot;you need to take test in college, you have to take a<br/>\ndriving test, how do you prepare your child for test taking if you are not<br/>\ngiving them the &quot;formal education&quot; that everyone says children need?&quot; are<br/>\nindeed formal, pencil and paper types of tests.]<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget: And like I said before, I&#39;ve had to take actual paper and pencil<br/>\ntests as part of job apps.  So has Rachel.  There are employers out there<br/>\nlike that and unless you are independently wealthy or win the lottery, you<br/>\nmight have to take one to get a job.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra: The question is not whether there were some.  The question was<br/>\nwhether EVERY job required it.  They do not.  I think most do not.  If some<br/>\ndo, then the original statement was still in error.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget: I never read anyone who said that EVERY job required it ...<br/>\n<br/>\n[Me: If you never read anyone who said ³every job², when ³every job² was not<br/>\nonly in the original post but in the quotes of *4* posts that came before<br/>\nyou said you ³never read², then is it a great leap to conclude ³Then you&#39;re<br/>\nthe second person in this thread to admit not having read it all?²]<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget (cont.): I never read anyone who said that EVERY job required it<br/>\nonly that it might be a good thing to at least be aware of and maybe<br/>\nprepared to face because some jobs require it.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Me: What you say above doesn&#39;t match *anything* -- even *paraphrased* --<br/>\nthat anyone said previously. If you want to check the entire thread from<br/>\nDee&#39;s question up to the point of my moderation it is down below my<br/>\nsignature.]<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra: Then you&#39;re the second person in this thread to admit not having<br/>\nread it all. PLEASE, to everyone involved, if you&#39;re skimming or just<br/>\nreading every third post, try to refrain from insulting or correcting the<br/>\ncommentary of those who ARE reading carefully.<br/>\n<br/>\nDee: Well, not every...sorry! But some.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Me: By this Dee is apparently realizing from the answers that she didn¹t<br/>\nask the question she really want to. But to be fair to anyone who answered<br/>\nafter this, Dee didn¹t include any quotes or anything so in the midst of 3<br/>\nor 4 simultaneous conversations it wasn¹t really clear what these two<br/>\nsentences were referring to.]<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget: I NEVER said any such thing.  In fact, in the 20 or so hours<br/>\nbetween the post you cite and this post the conversation about testing had<br/>\nincluded several posts and at the point I wrote mine, NO ONE was claiming<br/>\nthat every job required a pen and paper test.  In fact, the poster of the<br/>\none you cite below has since explained that based on HER observation it<br/>\nwould appear that not all but most jobs require written tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Me: 3 sentences and 3 or 4 factual errors: 1) You did not say you did not<br/>\nread in so many words, but your actions certainly lead to that conclusion.<br/>\n2) The 5 posts including the ³every job² phrase were in the 20 hour period<br/>\nyou mention. 3) You will notice Dee did not say ³most². She said ³some.² 4)<br/>\nAnd to call Dee¹s 2 short sentences an explanation based on her observation<br/>\nis stretching the truth real close to the breaking point.]<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget: I read every post.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Me: Previous to compiling this, I was giving you the benefit of the doubt<br/>\nthat you may have read the first post a bit too quickly and missed the<br/>\n³every job² bit. But now that I¹ve laid out everything nice and neat and<br/>\nsince the ³every job² part was quoted 4 times, and then your memory and<br/>\nsummarization of what was said previously is *incredibly* faulty, my powers<br/>\nof belief don¹t stretch quite that far. If you really are reading every post<br/>\nmy suggestion would be to no longer rely on your memory of what was said and<br/>\nto go back and reread what was actually written before telling someone else<br/>\ntheir memory is at fault. I would also suggest including direct quotes<br/>\nsince, at very the least, based on this and numerous past posts, *my*<br/>\nconfidence in your memory and abilities to accurately paraphrase is now<br/>\nnil.]<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget: And I was under the impression that the moderators were frowning<br/>\nupon the concept of pulling an old post out of context like you did here.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Me: Since I¹ve patiently explained to you the reasoning behind the ³no<br/>\nbringing up old posts² suggestion *at least* twice which was *after* one of<br/>\nthe previous moderators explained it *at least* once, to have this garbled<br/>\nversion of it posted to the list is really trying my patience.]<br/>\n<br/>\nSo once again, Sandra is right.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Damn she¹s good.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\nUnschooling-dotcom moderator<br/>\n<br/>\n(a copy of this message has been sent to the Unschooling-dotcom moderators<br/>\nlist)<br/>\n<br/>\n======== The posts from the thread this conversation refers to ========<br/>\n<br/>\non 5/23/02 1:41 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dbatiste7@...\">dbatiste7@...</a> at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dbatiste7@...\">dbatiste7@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Great ideas.

But they aren&#39;t. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; only the artificial reproduction of them in schools that doesn&#39;t exist in real<br/>\n&gt; life.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Before you asked for ideas on helping a child learn the sounds of the<br/>\n&gt; alphabet. But if you look at your older kids, was grasping that so difficult<br/>\n&gt; for them? The sounds *are* there in real life. If they weren&#39;t, then why would<br/>\n&gt; we learn them (formally or informally). It&#39;s useful to walk so kids walk. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; useful to talk so kids talk. The sounds the letters make are useful for<br/>\n&gt; figuring out what the on screen commands in a video game mean (among loads of<br/>\n&gt; other things!) so kids figure them out. ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As people said, tests are a part of life. Our mouths will pass or fail us on<br/>\n&gt; how well we&#39;ve read directions or a recipe. ;-) Tests are also part of real<br/>\n&gt; games people do just for fun. Video games, logic games, crossword puzzles,<br/>\n&gt; computer games, personality quizzes and so on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the one lesson about tests that kids don&#39;t need is that their entire<br/>\n&gt; future is riding on how well they do.

But they<br/>\naren&#39;t. It&#39;s only the artificial reproduction of them in schools that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t exist in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore you asked for ideas on helping a child learn the sounds of the<br/>\nalphabet. But if you look at your older kids, was grasping that so difficult<br/>\nfor them? The sounds *are* there in real life. If they weren&#39;t, then why<br/>\nwould we learn them (formally or informally). It&#39;s useful to walk so kids<br/>\nwalk. It&#39;s useful to talk so kids talk. The sounds the letters make are<br/>\nuseful for figuring out what the on screen commands in a video game mean<br/>\n(among loads of other things!) so kids figure them out. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs people said, tests are a part of life. Our mouths will pass or fail us on<br/>\nhow well we&#39;ve read directions or a recipe. ;-) Tests are also part of real<br/>\ngames people do just for fun. Video games, logic games, crossword puzzles,<br/>\ncomputer games, personality quizzes and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the one lesson about tests that kids don&#39;t need is that their entire<br/>\nfuture is riding on how well they do. That&#39;s a way too prominent message in<br/>\nschool and kids are having tests thrown at them every which way. If your<br/>\nkids want to take the SATs and know there&#39;s books and software and classes<br/>\nto familiarize them with the style if they feel it&#39;s necessary and they know<br/>\nthey can take it as many times as they want (as far as I know!), then it&#39;s<br/>\nnot a big deal.
