However,<br/>\nour government does not feel that it has made mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould we have turned our backs on the French?  Most certainly!!!  What<br/>\nright did they have to keep a sovereign nation in servitude and what right<br/>\ndid we have to help them?  And asking about Vietnam shows a little lack of<br/>\nhistorical knowledge.  Vietnam was the country we marched into at the<br/>\nrequest of the French.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, you can&#39;t look at the end of any given set of circumstances to make<br/>\nyour judgement.  Had our government not interfered to begin with and<br/>\nassisted Suddam&#39;s power drive there never would have been a Kuwait.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad our government never jumped into the middle of there *attempted* Russian<br/>\ntakeover, there were not be a Taliban.  In fact, if we had been so busy<br/>\ngiving the Taliban MILLIONS of dollars each year including $3 mil less than<br/>\na month before 9/11 they wouldn&#39;t have the money and resources to fight us<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did the same with Noreiga.  We in our so great and marvelous American<br/>\nwisdom decided who should be the government.  Then when he wouldn&#39;t play by<br/>\nour rules we hauled him in and put him in prison.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, no offense to anyone who is Jewish on this list but exactly why should<br/>\nbe help the Israelis invade a land they hadn&#39;t lived in for over a 1000<br/>\nyears so they could establish a religious community?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to focusing on one aspect of the man whose daddy bought him a presidency,<br/>\nplease go study his whole life.  You can go and find out all there is to<br/>\nknow about prior presidents&#39; grades when they were in college.  Not one of<br/>\ntheir transcripts has ever been sealed.  The minute the campaign started his<br/>\nwere sealed.  His daddy bought him into the National Guard AHEAD of 500 men<br/>\non the waiting list.  AND, to make sure he didn&#39;t have to go to war, he<br/>\nbought him into training on a plane that was decomissioned and would never<br/>\nbe used in the war so that he wouldn&#39;t have to go to war.  He never showed<br/>\nup half the time and was AWOL on more than once.  He couldn&#39;t run a business<br/>\nif his life depended on it.  He was a figure head for political purposes.<br/>\nHis oil businesses were on the verge of bankruptsy when they were bought up.<br/>\n<br/>\nShall I go on about the many negative aspects and zero positive aspects<br/>\nabout this person?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I certainly hope everyone wakes up and smells the coffee before this<br/>\nrecession becomes a depression!<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Sheri Piersol &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheri@...\">sheri@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 30, 2001 4:05 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1552<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Imperfect people = imperfect government<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I totally disagree with your comparisons of our President... you must be<br/>\n&gt; focusing on one aspect of the man (and office) and I on another.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I, too, am saddened by the thought that many mothers can&#39;t find food for<br/>\n&gt; their children.
