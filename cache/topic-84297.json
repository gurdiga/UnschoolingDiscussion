First is the &quot;work before play&quot;<br/>\n&gt;system, in which a certain minimum amount of work is required before the<br/>\n&gt;boys are allowed to play computer or video games. The second thing is that<br/>\n&gt;we pay them for working -- we have a weekly &quot;chores chart&quot; that we tote up<br/>\n&gt;at the end of each week -- the more work performed the more money they get.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We do this not only to &quot;coerce&quot; them into working but to show them that<br/>\n&gt;there is a relationship between doing work and enjoying the benefits of<br/>\n&gt;having worked.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, now that I&#39;ve gotten over snorting the black olives I was eating....<br/>\nI&#39;d have to say that rewards for chores SUCKS for the parents.  The kids <br/>\nwhine.  The kids try to avoid the chores.  The chores seem impenetrable, <br/>\nboring, never-ending and definitely hideous.  The parents have to chase the <br/>\nkid around, keep track of who did what (and who didn&#39;t do what), cajole, <br/>\nbeg, plead, threaten... and then the kids hold the specter of not having <br/>\nany spending money just because YOU said so.  (and it was you who decided <br/>\nthat they couldn&#39;t have any money if they didn&#39;t do what you required of <br/>\nthem, no?  That wasn&#39;t their decision imposed on you?)  Then, when all is <br/>\nsaid and done, the parent has to usually do the chore anyway, probably <br/>\nmuttering something about kids who don&#39;t care... etc.  Goodness.  Who wants <br/>\nto live in such a world?<br/>\n<br/>\n...and frankly, in the real world, there isn&#39;t usually a direct correlation <br/>\nbetween financial rewards and how much you worked.  I know gardeners who <br/>\nwork a WHOLE lot harder both physically, mentally and in terms of time <br/>\nspent, than certain of my relatives, and yet certain of my relatives pull <br/>\ndown six figure salaries.  The gardener barely makes it into five <br/>\nfigures.  Nevermind the legion of folks who work their butts off starting <br/>\nbusinesses, and no matter how hard they work, the biz fails.  ...But they <br/>\nworked hard.  Where&#39;s their money?  We were taught that work equals money!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo my way of thinking, the benefits of having worked are looking at the <br/>\nwork you just did and feeling good about it.  Do your kids feel terrific <br/>\nabout the work/chores they just completed, or was it a trial endured?  I <br/>\nsay, skip the coercion, the charts and the &#39;I&#39;m bigger than you, so I <br/>\nsay...&#39; games and let the kids choose when and where to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;ll happen.<br/>\nHeidiWD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGet all the fools on your side and you can be elected to anything. - Frank Dane</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84284,"nextTopicId":84307}}
