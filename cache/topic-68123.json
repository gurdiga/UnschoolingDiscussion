Learn to trust your own inner <br/>\njudgment.  If something about the child and the family &quot;bother&quot; you, even if <br/>\nyou can&#39;t exactly nail what it is, your innate judgment is trying to protect <br/>\nyou and your family.  Trust it!  Keep your distance from the entity that <br/>\ngives you bad vibes.  While you don&#39;t want to be mean to the neighbor child, <br/>\nyou want to protect and nurture YOUR CHILD, first and foremost.  Always keep <br/>\nthe focus on that.  .  .  .<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n In a message dated 5/7/2003 11:11:42 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmcseals@...\">jmcseals@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;Any of you ever deal with the friend issues and what did you do? Do I <br/>\n&gt; speak<br/>\n&gt; or zip it?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is extremely long, but here goes...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My daughter had a friend, E, that lived just around the corner.  They <br/>\n&gt; became <br/>\n&gt; friends around the age of 8 or so.  E always made me feel uncomfortable.  <br/>\n&gt; She was a bit overbearing and pushy which irritated me a lot of the time, <br/>\n&gt; but it never seemed to bother Haleigh at all.  I&#39;d ask if &#39;xyz&#39; bothered <br/>\n&gt; her <br/>\n&gt; and most of the time she acted like she had no idea what I was talking <br/>\n&gt; about.  There were a lot of little things that bothered me about E, so I <br/>\n&gt; figured it was my own biases or experiences that were coming through...not <br/>\n&gt; really reflecting E so much as myself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For example:  E always &#39;picked&#39; at her crotch.  Somewhat like picking a <br/>\n&gt; wedgie but in a constant, obvious kind of way and up front, not behind.  I <br/>\n&gt; know children who are sexually abused ten to have these sort of reactions <br/>\n&gt; and that thought never left my mind.  She was also always dirty, wore <br/>\n&gt; clothes that were either way too big or way too small.  She was overweight <br/>\n&gt; and had very large breasts, in proportion to her overall size and never <br/>\n&gt; wore <br/>\n&gt; a training bra.  She really needed one.  Much of the time, her breasts were <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; exposed through huge armholes of shirts without sleeves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There were other things that bothered us as well...my husband and I.  She <br/>\n&gt; made a very big deal about whispering and telling secrets.  I realize girls <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; love to do these things and it is quite normal.  However, there seemed to <br/>\n&gt; be <br/>\n&gt; something different about it with E.  Not really something I could put my <br/>\n&gt; finger on, but something my husband and I just couldn&#39;t get past.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She was ALWAYS at our house.
