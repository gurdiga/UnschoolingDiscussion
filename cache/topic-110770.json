I learned a lot of cool things from him,  <br/>\nmany not the &quot;real&quot; stuff--not the in-class stuff.  He was  <br/>\ninsightful, irritating and a font of connections and oddments.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who don&#39;t live where snow is probably don&#39;t know that if a  <br/>\nsnowflake lands on something like cloth it will sit there for a while  <br/>\nbefore it melts or is shaken off and sometimes you can see a little  <br/>\nof the shape of it.  Sometimes they fall in clumps, though, and look  <br/>\nmore like a pile of stuff that weighs nothing.  Sometimes those  <br/>\nclumps get heavy, and as they fall the edges turn up so they look  <br/>\nlike corn flakes (the shape, not the color) and start to wag back and  <br/>\nforth some as they fall.  Sometimes the wind is blowing and it turns  <br/>\ninto little ice balls and doesn&#39;t look so cool.  But sometimes on a  <br/>\nvery still day if the flakes fall so gently that they&#39;re not  <br/>\ncombining you can really see one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso when it&#39;s still that way you can look up and see them coming all  <br/>\naround you and it looks a little like when you&#39;re driving through  <br/>\nsnow and the snow goes in all directions (or when the Enterprise goes  <br/>\nthrough at warp speed and something (STARS!?

Santa<br/>\ncome early?<br/>\n<br/>\nI picked it up this morning and read it and was inspired. It seemed to<br/>\ntalk to unschooling so much! It is a testament to passion and<br/>\nfollowing one&#39;s interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about a man who was born in 1865 in Vermont, where snow was &quot;as<br/>\ncommon as dirt&quot;. But the boy loved snow. He spent every minute (during<br/>\nthe winter :) observing snow, picking up snowflakes, comparing<br/>\ndesigns, trying to draw them, etc. The neighbors sneered, the father<br/>\nthought it foolish, but since his parents loved him they spent their<br/>\nlife savings on a microscope/camera so that he could photograph<br/>\nsnowflakes. This in 1881 when he was 16.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boy, Wilson Bentley, spent two winters trying to get a decent<br/>\nsnowflake photograph, and then finally got it... using a tiny aperture<br/>\nand really long exposure. He spent many, many hours collecting,<br/>\nstudying, and photographing snowflakes. He never made any money from<br/>\nit, a group of scientists raised money so that he could publish a book<br/>\n&quot;Snow Crystals&quot; which is still a basic &quot;text&quot; for snow.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a quote from Wilson Bentley:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The average dairy farmer gets up at dawn because he has to go to work<br/>\nin the cow yard. I get up at dawn, too. But it is because I want to<br/>\nfind some leaf, hung with dew; or a spider web which the dew has made<br/>\ninto the most delicate ropes of pearls... I take my camera with me,<br/>\nget down on my knees in the wet grass, and photograph these exquisite<br/>\nbits of nature. Because I do this I can show these lovely things to<br/>\npeople who never would have seen them without my help. They will get<br/>\ntheir daily quart of milk, all right. Other farmers will attend to<br/>\nthat. But I think I am giving them something which is just as<br/>\nimportant.&quot; -- W. A.
