When someone asked for help with <br/>\nan ongoing situation with their child and her teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I responded with the idea of homeschooling or sending her <br/>\nchild to a democratic school where the child is respected. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother response was someone saying something about a jar of &#39;coins&#39; for <br/>\na goodie jar and to let the child get a coin for their behaviour and it <br/>\nworks just great.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I responded about bribery, Skinnerism does work - but at what cost, <br/>\nand quoted Alfie Kohn in Punished by Rewards.<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently, this unmoderated list *smile* member responded that &#39;well you <br/>\nhave to realize that its not for all kids&#39; blah blah blah. So I banged <br/>\nout my quick response in the mode I was in. Which was &#39;removed from <br/>\nemotion&#39; kind of mode. You know.. different styles depending on where <br/>\nyour head is at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &#39;coin&#39; lady responded with something about &#39;You MUST understand that <br/>\nwe don&#39;t beleive in bribery but this method is working great blah blah <br/>\nblah and that of course we are DIPLOMATIC with our child&#39;. (She totally <br/>\nmisread/understood DEMOCRATIC, and what it means to allow children <br/>\nchoices)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list owner then responded about how I was so rude etc. So I explained <br/>\nthat I was bringing up discussion and that my posting style, without all <br/>\nthat &#39;love&#39; &#39;bless you&#39; stuff, and that I would gladly leave the list <br/>\ninstead of getting into any kind of debate about rudeness.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuite a few people thanked me for the info.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m driving at is that these two people, listowner and personal <br/>\nfriend, found their parenting beleifs to be in question by my strong <br/>\nopinion on how to respect children. It wasn&#39;t rudeness, it was how it <br/>\naffects their belief system. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf their beleifs were strong in their head, and they felt what they were <br/>\ndoing was right, they would not have read any rudenes at all. They would <br/>\nof read a very strong differing opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all have our hot buttons. Geez, I know I have quite a few. And if we <br/>\nneed to coddle eachothers, then we will definately not move forward in <br/>\nour discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nkolleen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31447,"nextTopicId":31490}}
