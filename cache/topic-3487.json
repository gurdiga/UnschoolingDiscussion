My daughter had to learn that the world no longer revolved around her<br/>\nas it had when she was a baby.  As children grow up they need to understand<br/>\nthat they are part of a family not the center of it.  That way, when they<br/>\ngrow up, they are well adjusted to a world that does not revolve around them<br/>\nand it is easier to cope with basic life (things not going their way all the<br/>\ntime).  I just went through a class at our church called Growing Kids God&#39;s<br/>\nWay.  It was awesome!  My hubby and I have seen such a positive change in<br/>\nour kids because of basic principles we are now living by.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut don&#39;t let mom get you down.  He might be a handful at first b/c of baby<br/>\nbut he&#39;ll adjust.  I had my 2yo potty trained before baby was born and she<br/>\nstarted &#39;relapsing&#39; after.  But we just took it one day at a time and she&#39;s<br/>\ndoing fine now.  Every once in a while she tries to put baby&#39;s diaper on but<br/>\nthen we remind her she isn&#39;t a baby anymore, but a big girl who can do much<br/>\nmore things than baby.  And she smiles and goes off to play (something baby<br/>\ncan&#39;t do).<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep your chin up!  It&#39;ll be fine, and so will Mook!<br/>\nLiving for Him,<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  I cried to her for over an hour because Mook<br/>\n&gt; does so much for me, but I can&#39;t do anything for him, etc. - and she<br/>\n&gt; told me it just gets worse.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry to go on.  Any advice would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Love, Melanie in Japan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW, we&#39;re safe and ok.  The nuclear accident happened in Ibaraki (I<br/>\n&gt; believe that&#39;s north of here), and evidently isn&#39;t as bad as was<br/>\n&gt; reported overseas.  (Either that or the media here is really playing it<br/>\n&gt; down.)  According to the news here, nobody was killed, and everybody<br/>\n&gt; within a 1/2 km radius was evacuated.  That&#39;s all.
