I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true - but just in case<br/>\nit seemed worth passing on.<br/>\n<br/>\nDIAL 90#<br/>\nThis is scary to think that our kids are answering the phones. important,<br/>\nplease read.<br/>\n This can happen at home and at work, everyone should be aware...I&#39;ve sent<br/>\nthis to all my friends last Friday night and I&#39;ve already had 3 email me and<br/>\nsay that it&#39;s already happened to them.<br/>\nI received a telephone call from an individual identifying himself as an<br/>\nAT&T Service Technician that was running a test on our telephone lines. He<br/>\nstated that to complete the test we should touch nine (9), zero (0), pound<br/>\nsign (#) and hang up.  Luckily, we were suspicious and refused.<br/>\nUpon contacting the telephone company we were informed that by pushing<br/>\n90# you end up giving the individual that called you access to your<br/>\ntelephone<br/>\nline and allows them to place a long distance telephone call, with the<br/>\ncharge<br/>\nappearing on your telephone bill.<br/>\n We were further informed that this scam has been originating from many of<br/>\nthe local jails/prisons.  I have verified with UCB Telecomm. that this<br/>\nactually happens.<br/>\nI called GTE Security this morning and verified that this is definitely<br/>\npossible and DO NOT press 90# for ANYONE.  It will give them access to your<br/>\nphone line to make long distances calls ANYWHERE!!!!  The GTE Security<br/>\ndepartment told me to go ahead and share this information with EVERYONE I<br/>\nKNOW!!!<br/>\nCould you PLEASE pass this on.  If you have mailing lists and/or<br/>\nnewsletters from organizations you are connected with, I encourage you to<br/>\ninclude this information.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBecky<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion Authority - Ask me anything!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Wollenslegels<br/>\n431 Whitehall Drive<br/>\nColumbus,  OH  43213<br/>\nAbout Us - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~beckycraigw12/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~beckycraigw12/</a><br/>\nLove Those Baskets - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.longaberger.com\">http://www.longaberger.com</a><br/>\nSpoons and More - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mountaingourmet.com\">http://www.mountaingourmet.com</a><br/>\nGo Racing - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scca.org/index.html\">http://www.scca.org/index.html</a><br/>\nContact us for more info</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2394,"nextTopicId":2400}}
