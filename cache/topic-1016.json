I don&#39;t know if there are special issues, <br/>\nbecause we&#39;ve never had more than one child, so I don&#39;t have anything to <br/>\ncompare to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I know is, that my son manages to keep himself busy, and rarely asks to <br/>\nhave friends over.  He thrilled when they do come over, or we go someplace <br/>\nfor a visit, but he is so used to being on his own, that I honestly don&#39;t <br/>\nthink it occurs to him.  We belong to a support group that meets at least one <br/>\ntime a week, and often I try to wrangle some other &quot;kid time&quot; for him during <br/>\nthe week, but it doesn&#39;t always happen.  Unfortunely, we live about 40 miles <br/>\naway from our best friends, if they lived across the street, I think our <br/>\nlives would be considerably different.  <br/>\n<br/>\njocelyn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Olivia","from":"Olivia &lt;liv2learn@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"aUqV6TeMX0UyE4kkrQrcY4szAbsK7ZK_8vwHzW6afC-pNhzWpvfE_cjcYturiQB56RDzFjtYXdZnDhlM3GfkdXGzsmW_V4s","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 75","postDate":"929232073","msgId":1049,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy43OS4xMDQ5Ljk1OTI2OTc0MEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":1017,"nextInTopic":1050,"prevInTime":1048,"nextInTime":1050,"topicId":1016,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
