Kindergarten has <br/>\nheld a great mystique for Hannah, so I thought a 1/2 day visit would be <br/>\nperfect.  I contacted a friend in a small town (all the big towns have all <br/>\nday kinder) and asked her to request permission from her dd&#39;s teacher.  She <br/>\nexplained the whole *homeschooler curious about school* idea and the <br/>\nteacher&#39;s response was, &quot;No, she can&#39;t come to visit.  If we let her come, <br/>\nthen they&#39;ll all want to!&quot;  hee hee hee I guess they don&#39;t want us *all* <br/>\nafterall!!  <br/>\n diana,<br/>\nThe wackiest widow westriver...<br/>\nâ€œI&#39;m just a human being trying to make it in a world that is very rapidly <br/>\nlosing it&#39;s understanding of being human&quot; John Trudell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69154,"nextTopicId":69463}}
