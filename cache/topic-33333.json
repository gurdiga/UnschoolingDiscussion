Or do I WELCOME<br/>\nher and maybe, just maybe, let her see how great unschooling can be and that<br/>\nalthough our styles are completely different, we can still learn from each<br/>\nother?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Me, I told she was welcome anytime.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; KaraGet more from the Web.

It is for all families, regardless of <br/>\nreligious affiliation, choosing to unschool their children. Unschooling is <br/>\nchild-led learning, learning as a part of life. It allows the child to learn <br/>\nnaturally, without adult-imposed &quot;lessons&quot;, schedules, or timelines.

Unschooling is a well researched <br/>\ntheory which departs from the accepted norms of education in our society. <br/>\nLearning should be as natural as any other life process, ie; breathing and <br/>\neating. The theory of unschooling depends on the human being&#39;s innate desire <br/>\nto learn and strives to allow the individual the freedom to explore their <br/>\ncurrent areas of interest.
