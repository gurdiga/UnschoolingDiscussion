IT&#39;S ELEMENTARY shows what most adults can&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; imagine: that schools can address gay issues in age appropriate ways.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Schools cannot be neutral when dealing with human dignity and human<br/>\n&gt; rights,&quot; notes National Education Association President Bob Chase, head<br/>\n&gt; of the  country&#39;s largest public teacher association. &quot;I&#39;m not talking<br/>\n&gt; about tolerance. I&#39;m talking about acceptance. IT&#39;S ELEMENTARY is a<br/>\n&gt; great resource for parents, teachers and community leaders working to<br/>\n&gt; teach respect and responsibility to America&#39;s children.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First released in 1996, the film has been shown nationally at nearly<br/>\n&gt; 500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; teacher-training programs and to educators and parents at hundreds of<br/>\n&gt; schools, churches and synagogues. Last November, Chicago Public Schools<br/>\n&gt; announced an initiative to use the film for staff development and<br/>\n&gt; training in every school  in the district. IT&#39;S ELEMENTARY has won<br/>\n&gt; dozens of awards, including the CINE Golden Eagle for Best Educational<br/>\n&gt; Film.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The broadcasts of IT&#39;S ELEMENTARY are being presented by KQED/San<br/>\n&gt; Francisco  via American Public Television. Broadcast dates and times<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; subject to change,  and many stations not listed here are still<br/>\n&gt; considering airing IT&#39;S ELEMENTARY  later in the summer and early fall.<br/>\n&gt; We encourage you to get in touch with your local PBS station and urge<br/>\n&gt; them to air the film.
