I had an opportunity to visit with a man whose children spend time there <br/>\nalong with my children.  As we were visiting, I made a comment about <br/>\n&quot;manifesting&quot; which led us into a discussion about personal philosophies and <br/>\nhow they affected our children. He has a son who had been diagnosed with all <br/>\nkinds of disabilities. . . I would guess the &quot;worst&quot; of those being autism. <br/>\nHe was pretty much non communicative, they could not reach him at all, and <br/>\nthe &quot;experts&quot; had recommended things they just were not going to do with him. <br/>\nThis man&#39;s philosiphies about life in general very closely mirror my own. . . <br/>\nit was interesting to listen to someone who faced these types of challenges <br/>\nstand in that truth and find solutions for his son that allowed for his <br/>\nbeliefs to be the forefront of any remedy that they tried. They found a place <br/>\nthat has been doing some exceptional work with children like this, with the <br/>\nunderlying belief that we are the creators of our existence and <br/>\ncircumstances. It is intense work that goes on for an extended period of <br/>\ntime, getting into their world so to speak.  I am excited to learn of the <br/>\nwork being done in this area. For those who choose a different way of <br/>\nexploring who they are and who they can be by creating their reality, it is <br/>\nexciting to find others having such great success in this. This father spoke <br/>\nof the radical tranformation not only in his own son and family, but in the <br/>\nlives of hundreds of others he attended with. He is rejoicing not in the fact <br/>\nthat his son can now do things the other kids are doing, but in the joy in <br/>\nhis face now, and his ability to manipulate his own world and enlist the help <br/>\nof others when he chooses it. . . it was a remarkable story of truth and the <br/>\ncourage to not let labels or experts define who we are. <br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember that every act is an act of self-definition.  Every thought<br/>\ncarries the energy of creation.  Every word is a declaration of what is true<br/>\nfor you.
