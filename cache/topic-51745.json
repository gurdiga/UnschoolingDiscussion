We who consider it an overwhelming success in <br/>\nour families - see other &quot;lessons&quot; learned (how to direct ones own <br/>\nlearning/life, for example) as more significant than much of the content of <br/>\na school curriculum. Our criteria for success are different.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy niece is 16 and in public school where she gets mostly A&#39;s and is in the <br/>\ngifted program. She said she&#39;d been working on a project for her history <br/>\nclass - about the French revolution. I asked her what she thought was <br/>\nimportant about it - why would they be studying about it? She had no clue, <br/>\nbut she could list the chapter headings in her textbook.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - my kids know a lot about the French revolution - their interest comes <br/>\nfrom their love of the musical, &quot;Les Miserables.&quot; Roxana read the book <br/>\nitself, several times (if you haven&#39;t read it - it includes a LOT of <br/>\npolitical stuff). That background gave her the ability to pick up a lot <br/>\nmore just from stuff that appeared before her. She knows much more about it <br/>\nthan I do. So - just because I felt like it - I asked her why SHE thought <br/>\nthat it was important to study the French revolution. Her first answer was, <br/>\n&quot;Well - I could just talk about why history is important - as in how we <br/>\nneed to learn from it in order not to repeat it, but I guess you were <br/>\nasking more specifically about this one part of history?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; I <br/>\nanswered. She went on to think aloud about what made this particular bit of <br/>\nhistory especially important - she speculated on its impact on western <br/>\neurope in general, on the spreading of ideas of democracy and freedom for <br/>\nnonaristocrats, and perhaps influencing the eventual ideas of communism and <br/>\nso on.  What struck me was that she was THINKING about it - as opposed to <br/>\njust trying to &quot;remember and repeat&quot; what she&#39;d been told by her <br/>\nteacher/textbook. That THINKING is one of the goals of unschooling, imo, <br/>\nand so what I saw looked like &quot;success&quot; to me.
