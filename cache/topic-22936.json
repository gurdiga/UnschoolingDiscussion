Have you decided that it is time to<br/>\nput a stop to those pounds that keep creeping up on you each year through<br/>\nsedentary living?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of us at Overweight Homeschool Moms are at the same point in our lives.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve come together to seek support in our daily struggle with exercise,<br/>\nhealthy eating & just an overall healthy being.  Basically, we are a<br/>\nChristian (primarily) group of homeschool moms that have banded together to<br/>\nfight fat & the diseases that come with being over our healthy weight!<br/>\n<br/>\nEach of us knows what can happen to our families when we don&#39;t take care of<br/>\nthem.  Imagine what happens to them when we don&#39;t take care of ourselves!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo grab a glass of water, hook up to your pc & let&#39;s start encouraging each<br/>\nother on our daily walk to a longer, fuller, more enriching life!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://communities.msn.com/OverweightHomeschoolMoms\">http://communities.msn.com/OverweightHomeschoolMoms</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22935,"nextTopicId":22857}}
