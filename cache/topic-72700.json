Couldn&#39;t find what you had <br/>\n&gt; said.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; LOLAnyway, I think getting into the problem IS the way to think well, <br/>\n&gt; whether math probs or otherwise. Not fishing around for the right <br/>\n&gt; answer, but seeing oneself IN it, and figuring it out from there. If <br/>\n&gt; you posted about that, then yeah, you were following Holt logic!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; L I find Yahoo lists difficult to follow a thread. In fact! I <br/>\n&gt; went &quot;up thread&quot; on a topic today, and ended up reading something <br/>\n&gt; posted in the year 2000.!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; HeidiC(razy)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hey Heidi,<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is Rhonda. I was actually the one that asked you for clarification on <br/>\nthe Holt thought process. It was about when I was young and in school I could <br/>\nnever show my work in math. I always put myself in the problem and found my <br/>\nanswer that way. I gave the train analogy to Timbuctoo. LOL I thought you meant <br/>\nthat my though process was very Holt like and probably why I frustrated most <br/>\nteacher and myself for not being able to to their way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for answering though, sorry Mary, I probably pasted something with <br/>\nyour name on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda - who loves to Astrally Project<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72207,"nextTopicId":72708}}
