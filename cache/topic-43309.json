If it were my Mom she would have thrown them away and never said anything to him.  Nothing like denial and not dealing with anything!  I grew up in a loving environment too, they thought, but.... my parents were soooo uptight about sex that the whole porn thing was a total nothing to me.  I had no idea what exactly was in those movies!   <br/>\nThis kind of upbringing(for me) developed into shame for sexual feelings and all sorts of other uncertain feelings when it came to relationships.  I think if my parents would have discussed things with me, I may have had a clue and not put sex on the taboo list.  Along with drinking and other things.  <br/>\nSandra, I commend you for your honesty and people delving into your personal life.  I don&#39;t quite understand some accusations of not being involved in our children&#39;s lives just because we are trusting them.            Do we always have to expect the worse from our children?  hmmmmm...  I feel this goes with religious convictions sometimes!  IMO     <br/>\nIt seems that if we make something a taboo or off limits or a topic of avoidance its going to be a huge magnet for our children.  I feel this way about porn, drinking, drugs,,,,staying up late, eating snacks...the list goes on.  I&#39;m sure this has been discussed a ton on this list.       We just need to talk with our children and let them talk about how they are feeling.      <br/>\nThank you Sandra, Ren,Mary, Debs, Shyrley and others who have taught me so much on just being an accepting and loving parent and hopefully I can do a better job with my children than mine did with me!  They might not have all the hangups that I had to fight my way through. <br/>\n <br/>\nKelli,  who is going to shut up now for a while.<br/>\n Shyrley wrote:On 8 Sep 02, at 15:46, kayb85 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In a message dated 9/8/02 8:57:39 AM, kenyonbook@y... writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; I would have to say I would not want my son to have a friend that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is freely exposed to pornography in his own home.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; No one on this list as advocated &quot;freely exposing to pornography.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; That was <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the straw man set up by someone trying to show the evil end that <br/>\n&gt; saying yes <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to our children more than we say no will &quot;inevitably&quot; lead them to.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But IF he wanted to watch/read porgnography and really started <br/>\n&gt; getting into it, what would you do? <br/>\n&gt; Sheila<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This leads to a debate about how much &#39;control&#39; we should have <br/>\nover our children.<br/>\nI feel uncomfortable watching people control their children because <br/>\nthey are *theirs*.

That said, I just started <br/>\nreading again, and was pleasantly surprised to find some very <br/>\ninteresting, albeit controversial, topics bouncing around, sans <br/>\nNed!  I am a Christian unschooler, and the mother of 7.  Like the <br/>\nposter, H., I believe in monitoring what my children read, watch, or <br/>\ndo, even though I trust them. Why? Because I think that should be a <br/>\npart of parenting.  I, too, am a little shocked at the attitude that <br/>\nchildren can decide what is good or bad for themselves.  At a <br/>\ncertain age, yes, and I think that age varies with each child, but <br/>\nin general, I think the lure of pornography is very strong and very <br/>\ndangerous (even for many adult men!  It has ruined many a marriage)  <br/>\nI have a 22-year-old son who always jokes that I &quot;ruined&quot; dirty <br/>\nmagazines for him by nursing his siblings so long and openly.  He <br/>\nsays if he looked at a woman in a magazine he would probably just <br/>\nimagine them nursing an infant and it would ruin the whole <br/>\nthing. :o)   We had talks with him and all our children know we <br/>\nthink Playboy and other such magazines are a sinful portrayal of <br/>\nboth women and sex. (yes, we do still believe in sin at our house) <br/>\nWe wouldn&#39;t have any Karma Sutra books or games in our house either, <br/>\nand we have raised our children to believe sex outside of marriage <br/>\nis wrong too.  Luckily, my oldest son has found a wonderful girl who <br/>\nbelieves that too.  However, they also know that we believe humans <br/>\nmake mistakes and they could come to us if they ever got into <br/>\ntrouble in any way.  My daughter was a virgin when she got married a <br/>\nyear ago, and is proud of that.  I have a 15-year-old son who stays <br/>\nup until 11:00 and watches &quot;Friends&quot; (which we have talked about- <br/>\nthose characters sleep around pretty freely, we had to talk about <br/>\nthat)  As a family, we often watch war movies that are rated &quot;R&quot; but <br/>\nwe limit our other video-viewing to rated &quot;G&quot; or maybe &quot;PG&quot; (which <br/>\nlimits us greatly, but we have better things to do than watch <br/>\ntelevision anyway)  I don&#39;t know who brought it up awhile back about <br/>\nmusic and video viewing, but I agree that what we listen to or watch <br/>\nhas a strong influence in what we become.  I would add reading to <br/>\nthat, too.  My kids read voraciously but there are books they end up <br/>\nsetting aside because of the content, just as I do. We even <br/>\nhesitated on the Harry Potter books for a very long time because I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to &quot;invite Satan into my home&quot; (as my mother put it)  I <br/>\nlet the older children read it and they weren&#39;t impressed and didn&#39;t <br/>\njump on the Harry Potter bandwagon like they probably would have if <br/>\nthey had been in school.   I mentioned once we are fairly isolated, <br/>\nand we like it that way.  That also means my children are not really <br/>\nexposed to peer pressure until they are old enough to deal with it <br/>\nreally well.   This is apparent if you are around my children for <br/>\nany length of time.  They don&#39;t care what is &quot;in&quot;, they don&#39;t feel <br/>\nthe need to dress a certain way, they read what they want, unlike <br/>\ntheir schooled cousins who read what everyone else is reading, wear <br/>\nwhat everyone else is wearing and listen to whatever everyone else <br/>\nis listening to.   They don&#39;t get caught up in the latest fads, <br/>\neither.  They don&#39;t know that a 16-year-old isn&#39;t supposed to want <br/>\nto play with his younger siblings, or if they do know that, they <br/>\ndon&#39;t care. Anyway, I am getting off-topic, my basic point is that <br/>\nwe do monitor what they watch, read, listen to, in a fairly loose <br/>\nand flexible way. (in other words, they can convince us to let them <br/>\nread or watch something if they can point out or find some merit in <br/>\nit)<br/>\nI missed the references to birth and discipline but I sure hope no <br/>\none on this list follows the Ferber or whats his name (the couple <br/>\nwho strongly encourages letting babies cry it out and now I can&#39;t <br/>\nremember their names)method of controlling their babies.  I can&#39;t <br/>\nimagine an unschooler being so rigid.  I guess with nursing on <br/>\ndemand, going with the flow, family-bedding type of parents we are, <br/>\nwe naturally turned towards unschooling.  <br/>\nIn regards to birth, I&#39;ve had it all- laboring in 1980 lying flat on <br/>\nmy back hooked up to machines, laboring in 1987 walking the hospital <br/>\ncorridors until 10 cm. dilated and pushing a baby out in two pushes, <br/>\nan emergency c-section, a V-Bac.... I would have loved a home <br/>\nbirth.  &quot;Mothering&quot; magazine has been one of my most helpful <br/>\nresources in pregnancy and beyond.  Dr. William Sears&#39; books have <br/>\nalso been wonderful. He is a Christian attachment-parenting <br/>\nadvocate. <br/>\nI&#39;ve rambled long enough, feeling very vocal today....  I think the <br/>\npornography issue got my blood going again.  I have 3 sons and this <br/>\nis an area I am always sensitive to.  I never want any of them to <br/>\nlook at females in that way.  Of course, our family&#39;s religious <br/>\nprinciples are our guiding force in these decisions.  But, religion <br/>\naside, I would have to say I would not want my son to have a friend <br/>\nthat is freely exposed to pornography in his own home.  (my oldest <br/>\nson DID, and chose to end that friendship himself, after the <br/>\nprominent lawyer&#39;s son pulled an X-rated video out of their cabinet <br/>\nand popped it into the VCR one day)<br/>\nMary, In IA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43408,"nextTopicId":43532}}
