I would tend to leave it between the kids and the relatives, unless<br/>\nit really seemed to bother them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother one I refuse to force on kids is apologies.  There&#39;s nothing worse<br/>\nthan getting an insincere apology from someone because they were required<br/>\nto say it.  I&#39;d rather have no apology than a forced one.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nThis can be challenging at times with other grownups....I&#39;ll never forget<br/>\nwhen a friend&#39;s dd hit my dd.  My dd was, understandably,  hurt and angry.<br/>\nThe other mom wanted to force her dd not only to apologize,  but to hug my<br/>\ndd!  I was thankful I was present to inform the mom that if my dd refuses a<br/>\ntouch,  her will must be respected.  The mom was upset since it is(was-i<br/>\nhope) her &#39;policy&#39; to make her children apologize and embrace. (Nevermind<br/>\nthat whatever upset the poor 3 yr old in the first place was still upsetting<br/>\nher)<br/>\n    There&#39;s a book used in gerontology circles for folks with dementia which<br/>\ndescribes &quot;validation therapy&quot;,  which basically means recognizing the<br/>\nperson&#39;s feelings and validating that feeling and, therefore, the person.<br/>\nThis seems like basic empathy,  but recognizes the fact that the person may<br/>\nnot be capable of controlling how the react to the feeling.<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29602,"nextTopicId":29560}}
