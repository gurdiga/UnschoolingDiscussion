Already wrote down some titles of books<br/>\nthat I&#39;m going to read so it seems we are off to a good start.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso just wanted to comment on sleeping with your kids - my son still <br/>\nwants me to sleep with him now but only when he is ill. He will get<br/>\nup and down up and down and no one will sleep but let me lie down next<br/>\nto him and hold his hand and his breathing slows and in 10 minutes he <br/>\nis asleep for the rest of the night and I can return to my own bed. <br/>\nWhen he was little he hated his crib and always climbed out and came <br/>\nto our bed finally at about 14 months we put a twin bed next to our <br/>\nbed and he slept in it and never woke up at night. Not much help for <br/>\nromance but......he soon outgrew it and went into his own room at <br/>\naround 4 yrs old. So my advice is not to worry about the effects,<br/>\njust <br/>\nknow that you are making them feel safe and secure.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again looking forward to the group....</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15255,"nextTopicId":15264}}
