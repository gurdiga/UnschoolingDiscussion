Lilly wasn&#39;t <br/>\nsteering the measure, the company says. Just going along for the ride.<br/>\n<br/>\nIndeed, diligent searching turned up no identifiable Lilly fingerprints.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, predictably, this careening ride through the halls of Congress has <br/>\nended in a noisy crash.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Friday, Senate Republicans agreed to repeal the Lilly lawsuit protection <br/>\nmeasure. The House quickly pledged to follow suit.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor nearly a year&#39;s lobbying, Lilly has come away with little more than a <br/>\npublic relations black eye.The White House and Congress drew up the Homeland <br/>\nSecurity Act to guard the nation against terrorists, not trial lawyers.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut must-pass legislation like this is particularly tempting to lobbyists. <br/>\nGet your pet measure attached to it, and it will pass into law. Nobody will <br/>\ndare vote no, or cast a veto, against critical legislation just to dunk a <br/>\npesky rider.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat tempted Lilly was the prospect of shielding itself from lawsuits <br/>\ninvolving thimerosal, a vaccine preservative that contains mercury. Lilly no <br/>\nlonger makes thimerosal.<br/>\n<br/>\nScores of parents of autistic children blame their kids&#39; autism on <br/>\nthimerosal, and are suing. Lilly says the lawsuits are groundless.<br/>\n<br/>\nResearch on the question so far is inconclusive.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast fall, Lilly spokesman Edward Sagebiel said Monday, Lilly asked Congress <br/>\nto add thimerosal lawsuit protection to the Homeland Security bill.<br/>\n<br/>\nLilly got the door slammed in its face. No way, the word came back. <br/>\nCongressional leaders wanted a clean bill -- one not burdened with lots of <br/>\nspecial favors.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that point, Sagebiel says, &quot;We stopped our lobbying efforts.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when the measure emerged from Congress, lo and behold, there was the <br/>\nlawsuit protection.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was no lack of suspects, including maybe some unidentified Capitol <br/>\nHill ally of White House budget maestro Mitch Daniels, a former Lilly <br/>\nexecutive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll denied involvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Lilly nevertheless appeared to have benefited from someone&#39;s cynical <br/>\nmanipulation of critical national security legislation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a statement released Friday, Lilly said it &quot;agrees that the process by <br/>\nwhich this legislation was enacted was not desirable, and fully understands <br/>\nthe action taken by the Senate.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe legislative sleight-of-hand that slipped the lawsuit shield into the <br/>\nHomeland Security Act didn&#39;t just put egg on Lilly&#39;s corporate face. It also <br/>\nheightened the suspicions of those parents who are suing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s handed ammunition, at least in a public relations sense, to their <br/>\nattorneys.<br/>\n<br/>\nLilly&#39;s not giving up, though. It plans to pursue identical legislation this <br/>\nspring, Sagebiel says.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that effort, the company has powerful political allies. The list includes <br/>\nSenate Majority Leader William Frist, a medical doctor who favors the <br/>\nlawsuit shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s the way to go about it. As a piece of separate legislation. <br/>\nDebated on its merits, in full public view.<br/>\n<br/>\nContact Thomas P.
