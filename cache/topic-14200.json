It was just a general <br/>\nquestion.  <br/>\n3 of my 4 older children left school with no qualifications.  One is <br/>\na mechanic, one head storeman and one a receptionist. My eldest, who <br/>\ndid get qualifictons, is in banking.  I would not say any of them had <br/>\nfailed.<br/>\nMarianne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14198,"nextTopicId":14208}}
