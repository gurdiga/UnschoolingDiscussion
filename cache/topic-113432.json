If <br/>\ntwo people fell in love at one point, had children, and can work with a mediator <br/>\nto deal with custody, it seems that other issues could have been resolved too. <br/>\n In my experience, a person who tries to control another, is a person who feels <br/>\nout of control and needs to desperately find it.  The more desperate that person <br/>\nis, the more they will seek to control others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see how divorce can make that better.  The person who felt the need for <br/>\ncontrol will only feel more out of control and possibly attempt to control more. <br/>\n It isn&#39;t necessarily the act of control that is so horrible for people to deal <br/>\nwith, it is the attempt that people use to try to control that feels so <br/>\nhorrible.  If the tiny shred of trust that existed within the marriage is gone, <br/>\nthe attempts to control will likely only get uglier.  It may be that way for <br/>\nyears.  There may be temporary peace for a while, but that issue isn&#39;t going to <br/>\ngo away.  The object of control may change to the children, and to me, that <br/>\nseems far worse.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":397091193,"authorName":"Selena Jones","from":"Selena Jones &lt;goleafsgogirl@...&gt;","profile":"goleafsgogirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Divorce (was Re: Music Lessons)","postDate":"1281890244","msgId":113450,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrRFVpUkY1b0E5ZHlYZTA3SHAzd3BVOXNVc1lTZUNNdi1zdzhaY0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDI4MjcyOC42NDAzMC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTQubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFERDBDQ0ZCLTJEM0EtNDQ2My1CQjlDLUU3REI4ODQxNzQ1OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPEJMVTAtU01UUDczQUFCNkYwQzBENDQ3OENEQUU4ODhBNDk5MEBwaHguZ2JsPgk8N0M1RUYyODEtQzc4NC00ODcyLUI3MjAtNDAyQUM5NThERTUyQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPgk8QkxVMC1TTVRQNTQ5OEFGMEQ0QkQ5Njg2Nzg4RDFFN0E0OTkwQHBoeC5nYmw+CTw0QkVERTBGOC0xNjhDLTQ5MTUtODZFQi0yODkwNDdCREQ1NTJAdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+CTxCTFUwLVNNVFAzNUVDREMzMzhGM0Y4OTdDRUMwNDIxQTQ5OTBAcGh4LmdibD4JPDI4MjcyOC42NDAzMC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTQubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":113449,"nextInTopic":113451,"prevInTime":113449,"nextInTime":113451,"topicId":113432,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Unschooling  <br/>\nis BIG, like owning a yacht.  If a couple doesn&#39;t agree on owning a  <br/>\nyacht, it&#39;s not happening.  If a couple gets divorced, the yacht  <br/>\nprobably ends up being sold.  But it&#39;s possible (legal and often  <br/>\nadvisable) for someone else to take care of the yacht part time or  <br/>\nfull time (another great expense that would need to be agreed upon).   <br/>\nUnschooling can only be done within the family.  If others do it, it&#39;s  <br/>\ntutoring, or school, not unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople come to this list to discuss unschooling, and that&#39;s why  <br/>\ndivorces shouldn&#39;t be encouraged here, or treated as just another  <br/>\noption equal to any other factors.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":242464666,"authorName":"Michele Sears","from":"Michele Sears &lt;michelesears@...&gt;","profile":"birthinlove","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Divorce","postDate":"1281871321","msgId":113445,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJMVTAtU01UUDI3MTQwODdGRTZENTFCQjI0MDA1QUFBNDlBMEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk5ODgxOS41NTE3MS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMy5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDFERDBDQ0ZCLTJEM0EtNDQ2My1CQjlDLUU3REI4ODQxNzQ1OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPEJMVTAtU01UUDczQUFCNkYwQzBENDQ3OENEQUU4ODhBNDk5MEBwaHguZ2JsPiA8N0M1RUYyODEtQzc4NC00ODcyLUI3MjAtNDAyQUM5NThERTUyQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QkxVMC1TTVRQNTQ5OEFGMEQ0QkQ5Njg2Nzg4RDFFN0E0OTkwQHBoeC5nYmw+IDw5MjU0QzhBNi05NzAzLTQ5NzItOTUxNi1EQ0ZCNjNBRjlEMDFAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxCTFUwLVNNVFA4MDY1Mzc0MjkzNDAzNkJDMzgxQzAxQTQ5QTBAcGh4LmdibD4gPDk5ODgxOS41NTE3MS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMy5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":113444,"nextInTopic":113446,"prevInTime":113444,"nextInTime":113446,"topicId":113432,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

A reasonable perspective when talking about a divorce, which is the breakdown of the relationship between two ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1379857296\">Much of what you are writing about is about you. A reasonable perspective when <br/>\ntalking about a divorce, which is the breakdown of the relationship between two <br/>\npeople, but it helps when discussing parenting to realise that what is true for <br/>\nyou isn&#39;t true for your children. So talking about divorce not being a situation <br/>\nof decline may be true in your experience, but may absolutely not be the same <br/>\nfor your children. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;True enough.  However, many children express much sorrow and loss, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>grief and anger, in many ways and at different stages, about many of <br/>\nlife&#39;s uncertainties and unfairnesses.  Death.  Divorce. The loss of a <br/>\npet.  Having to share.  Etc. Etc.   And I still believe that it&#39;s the <br/>\nability of these children to express their emotions in a safe <br/>\nenvironment, NOT to hide them, that helps them through.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a sliding scale death, divorce and then having to share? Death is pretty <br/>\nawful, divorce, yep bad too, sharing stuff, well, being forced to share is <br/>\npretty crap, but it isn&#39;t really comparable to death and divorce. And the death <br/>\nof a pet, well Simon and Linnaea and I have watched one pet fish eat another pet <br/>\nfish&#39;s babies, that was kind of fun, in a nature red in tooth and claw sort of <br/>\nmoment. On the other hand we&#39;ve cuddled around a cat as she died and I have <br/>\ncried for days over a dog, but there is a difference between that death and the <br/>\nlasting legacy that divorce can leave. All of those moments may go to <br/>\nirrevocably change your children, but some will have more of an effect than <br/>\nothers. And I believe that on your sliding scale divorce is on the high end. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a very luxurious experience to have to believe that divorce can have a <br/>\nnominal effect on the lives of your children. Among the Ache of Paraguay the <br/>\nabsence of a father leads to the increased risk of death of his children. Among <br/>\nthe Mayans of Belize the one divorce I heard about lead to the adoption by <br/>\nothers of all the children because the parents could no longer support a child <br/>\nbeing at home. And while that might be something one could dismiss as a cultural <br/>\ndifference, given that all humans I know of are derived from hunter-gatherer <br/>\npopulations usually having moved through subsistence farming, biologically <br/>\nchildren should get stressed by the termination of their parent&#39;s marriage. The <br/>\nrisks to their own well being, their own lives may be at stake. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Point well taken.  But, for those reading that would feel discouraged <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and badly about divorce, I still respectfully disagree that divorce is <br/>\na situation of decline.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that everyone reading on this list feels discouraged and badly about <br/>\ndivorce and looks to ways to make their marriages better and stronger. I hope <br/>\nthat everyone who is reading here thinks that maybe they&#39;ll reach out with a bit <br/>\nmore affection or with a gentle gift of something special for their partner <br/>\ntoday because they feel discouraged at the idea of their marriage spiralling <br/>\ndown to a divorce and they want to do all that they can to buoy it up. Divorce <br/>\nis a state of declination from marriage. Divorce is not such a good state for <br/>\nchildren. I have a book that I&#39;ve read some of about called The Legacy of <br/>\nDivorce. It&#39;s a qualitative, long term study of the effects of divorce on <br/>\nchildren. Turns out, mostly, that it isn&#39;t all that great. Turns out that <br/>\nchildren are mostly unaware of the tension in the marriage before the divorce <br/>\nbut are desperately aware of it after. And that the effect doesn&#39;t necessarily <br/>\nshow up immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own legacy of divorce story I can truly state that I was more upset about <br/>\nthe disappearance of my cat than I was about the news of my parents getting <br/>\ndivorced. They didn&#39;t divorce until I was 18 and living outside of their home. I <br/>\nwas done and dusted, moved out, all grown up, it shouldn&#39;t really play that big <br/>\na role anymore. But I can get sour about it, get tense when I call and my <br/>\nstep-dad answers or hate having to chat at my step-mom. I can get sad that <br/>\nnobody talks about me as a baby, as a toddler, as a child anymore. My dad forgot <br/>\nhow old I am.  Maybe he would have anyhow, maybe it was just a slip between <br/>\nbrain and tongue, but maybe it was because there is no turning towards their <br/>\nchildren together, but a turning away from the evidence of their previous <br/>\nrelationships in a bid for loyalty to their newer relationships. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a list that goes out to lots of folks it is important to be clear about your <br/>\nmessage. On a list about unschooling the message starts with supporting your <br/>\nchildren. Arguing that divorce is simply a state change and not a level change <br/>\nmay be appropriate on a lisst about supporting a mother or a father, but on a <br/>\nlist where the focus is on improving the lives of our children and our <br/>\nrelationships with them it just seems an odd decision. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Michele Sears &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michelesears@...\">michelesears@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, 15 August, 2010 3:17:34<br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Divorce<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ideally for unschooling (which is more to the point for this list)...<br/>\n&gt; Having access to both parents at the same time can be nice, for<br/>\n&gt; unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How is this possible?

And I still believe that it&#39;s the  <br/>\nability of these children to express their emotions in a safe  <br/>\nenvironment, NOT to hide them, that helps them through.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you don&#39;t feel it and the kids know, but you say &quot;this is love,&quot;<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s not modelling clarity and honesty for the children.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not saying that raw emotion would be appropriate either, but<br/>\n&gt; honesty and clarity make or break trust.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I don&#39;t agree with you on this point - would it be healthier for  <br/>\nme to say &quot;Your father is an ass because he slept with another woman,  <br/>\nexposed me to STD&#39;s, lied to all of us continually, and chose to run  <br/>\naway instead of working things out to be with all of us?&quot;   I can&#39;t  <br/>\nknow that he&#39;s an ass for all of that - but I can feel that he is.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s not my job to lay my opinions of their father (based primarily on  <br/>\nmy emotion) on them - they have their own relationship with him.  So  <br/>\nalthough I may FEEL angry and unloving, it is right for my children  <br/>\nthat I honor what I KNOW to be true - he is their father, they adore  <br/>\nhim, and that alone deserves him respect because doing otherwise hurts  <br/>\nthe children.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best friend, incidentally, has cheated on her husband for over a  <br/>\nyear and has now left him.  I love her dearly - and although I don&#39;t  <br/>\nagree with what she&#39;s done, she&#39;s not an ass.  She did the best she  <br/>\ncould in her situation, and deserves to be supported in her motherhood  <br/>\nwith her children.  By the father and her family.  That is best for  <br/>\nthe children.  His opinions of her do not belong in their children&#39;s  <br/>\nminds or hearts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichele</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":397091193,"authorName":"Selena Jones","from":"Selena Jones &lt;goleafsgogirl@...&gt;","profile":"goleafsgogirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Divorce (was Re: Music Lessons)","postDate":"1281832199","msgId":113443,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluMnlkZW93bmNmNGFDcm5xS19Pb3M3VHVidk1kVWttaF96SFFkZUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJMVTAtU01UUDM1RUNEQzMzOEYzRjg5N0NFQzA0MjFBNDk5MEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFERDBDQ0ZCLTJEM0EtNDQ2My1CQjlDLUU3REI4ODQxNzQ1OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPEJMVTAtU01UUDczQUFCNkYwQzBENDQ3OENEQUU4ODhBNDk5MEBwaHguZ2JsPgk8N0M1RUYyODEtQzc4NC00ODcyLUI3MjAtNDAyQUM5NThERTUyQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPgk8QkxVMC1TTVRQNTQ5OEFGMEQ0QkQ5Njg2Nzg4RDFFN0E0OTkwQHBoeC5nYmw+CTw0QkVERTBGOC0xNjhDLTQ5MTUtODZFQi0yODkwNDdCREQ1NTJAdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+CTxCTFUwLVNNVFAzNUVDREMzMzhGM0Y4OTdDRUMwNDIxQTQ5OTBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":113442,"nextInTopic":113444,"prevInTime":113442,"nextInTime":113444,"topicId":113432,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So much food for thought.

It helps to see things from all sides.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our circumstance, having Dad around was nothing something they were used<br/>\nto (he worked between 60-120 hours a week) so having him gone isn&#39;t as much<br/>\nof an adjustment as it would be for other children who are used to having a<br/>\nfather who is more involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children have very different relationships with their Dad. My son (11)<br/>\nhas exceptional needs and his Dad has openly said he doesn&#39;t like that he&#39;s<br/>\nautistic and would gladly hand over the parenting reigns to me. My daughter<br/>\nis &quot;neurotypical&quot; as they say and he finds her a joy to parent because he<br/>\nsays it&#39;s easier. That is his choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe there will be more freedom for me to in our days because without<br/>\nmy husband in the house, there&#39;s peace. My kids feel more free to explore<br/>\nthe things that interest him because he is there not there to criticize.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree wholeheartedly with Sandra that honesty is key. Without a foundation<br/>\nof trust, anything you try to build on that will falter in some way. So I am<br/>\nhonest with my kids. They know that Mum and Dad are better as friends living<br/>\nin two different houses than we are as husband and wife sharing the same<br/>\nhome. They know that I don&#39;t always agree with everything Dad does and that<br/>\nis okay, as he doesn&#39;t always agree with everything I do. Again, that is<br/>\nokay. However, what is *not* okay is to disrespect people, belittle them,<br/>\nmock them or try to control them. I also nurture the relationship they have<br/>\nas siblings, something my husband disagrees with (saying my daughter will be<br/>\nharmed by having an autistic brother).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am extremely thankful that when the house is quiet and my kids are<br/>\nimmersed in whatever is currently sparking their interest, they start to<br/>\ntalk. Sometimes a lot, sometimes a little. But I&#39;ve made it very clear that<br/>\nthey&#39;re entitled to feel whatever they feel and no topic is off limits. I<br/>\nwould rather they come to me with their thoughts than to keep it inside and<br/>\nit builds up to a point where it&#39;s beyond what they can cope with. That has<br/>\nworked extremely well for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think mediation is key to keeping the anger at a minimum, and the<br/>\ncommunication open. We mediated custody and it was by far the best decision<br/>\nwe made. It enabled me to have a voice, and a third party to keep things<br/>\ncalm.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the best things for myself and for my kids will be to have some<br/>\ncontrol over finances again. I was never allowed access to the bank account<br/>\nand had to ask permission for everything. Now, when I want to go and buy<br/>\nfinger paints, a huge roll of paper, and let them go crazy with their art<br/>\nskills in the backyard? I can. And I can&#39;t tell you how thrilled I will be<br/>\nwhen that happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re healing right now. We&#39;re learning a lot of from each other and we&#39;re<br/>\nestablishing new family &quot;rules&quot; for lack of a better word, about how to<br/>\ntreat one another. My husband hasn&#39;t moved out yet, but should be in the<br/>\nfall. My kids are happier when it&#39;s just the three of us, more settled, more<br/>\ncomfortable in their own skin. That&#39;s healthy and vital.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is my job to nurture their relationship with their Dad no matter how<br/>\nfractured and when they&#39;re of an age to decide for themselves whether or not<br/>\nits a relationship they will continue or not, I will be there to love them<br/>\nthrough whatever decision they make.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetween now and then we&#39;re all finding our way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSelena<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, Aug 14, 2010 at 7:24 PM, Michele Sears &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michelesears@...\">michelesears@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And how can one parent ensure the other partner does any of that?

And, that if one is headed","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1224540479\">I&#39;m suggesting that the idea of change and improvement of one&#39;s life,  <br/>\nthrough divorce, is also within the realm of possibility.  And, that  <br/>\nif one is headed down the road of divorce, it&#39;s very easy to hear  <br/>\nabout how bad this is and to worry and to want it to be different -  <br/>\nbut the &quot;how&quot; of making a divorce as good as possible for kids is hard  <br/>\nto find.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, saying that divorce will cause overall decline or improvement  <br/>\nseems to simplify a complex web of change that occurs when one  <br/>\ndivorces.  Some fronts are initially more difficult (finances,  <br/>\npossessions, change), some fronts are easier (possible decrease in  <br/>\nmarital tension, staking out of one&#39;s space, time to reflect).   And  <br/>\nthese changes are so unique to each circumstance and person that it is  <br/>\ndifficult to broadstroke it with better or worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly statistics can make divorce look dire and overall &quot;bad&quot;.   <br/>\nBut many divorce statistics do not reflect life quality.  There is an  <br/>\nassumption between variables that are made.  (is - income=happiness)    <br/>\nMy income went down.  I live below the poverty line (as far as my  <br/>\nincome taxes are concerned).  However - we have all we need -  <br/>\nvacations, lessons, clothing, etc.  I am creative with money.  There  <br/>\nis no sense of lack.  Their father&#39;s income went up.  His household  <br/>\nhas all they need and more!!   And I still hear about his angry fits  <br/>\nand see him stressed out and watch his weight fluctuate with his  <br/>\nstress.  On paper this income change for me looks &quot;bad&quot; - but it&#39;s  <br/>\nnot.    Not even a little bit bad.  And I&#39;m not sure that we can  <br/>\ndefinitively say that his income going up is &quot;good&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, statistics on how children fare after a divorce look bad too.   <br/>\nBut, in my experience, it&#39;s not just the divorce that affects them -  <br/>\nit&#39;s how the adults around them handle the divorce and each other. I&#39;m  <br/>\nnot sure if the research distinguishes between &quot;loving divorces&quot; and  <br/>\n&quot;nasty divorces&quot;, or even whether it should.  I believe that if  <br/>\nchildren are allowed to feel however they feel, are supported through  <br/>\nthis with contact and support from their parents, then what is  <br/>\nhappening around them is less of a defining factor in their life.   My  <br/>\nchildren have access to either parent whenever they choose - as much  <br/>\nas is reasonable for their age.  They speak with the non-access parent  <br/>\ndaily; often a couple times a day.  They can call either of us  <br/>\nwhenever; e-mail is used, and in many ways it&#39;s no different than  <br/>\nstaying in contact with a parent (or a partner) who travels a lot for  <br/>\nwork.  It&#39;s the staying connected part that I feel is really important  <br/>\nfor the kids through the divorce.  Not getting lost in the adult&#39;s  <br/>\nbusiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf divorce is inevitable, then keep showing the kids you love their  <br/>\nother parent (through words and kind deeds) even if you can&#39;t really  <br/>\nfeel it in the moment, accept and support the kids&#39; feelings, be  <br/>\naccessible to the kids as much as possible, especially when they&#39;re  <br/>\nvisiting the other parent, and work to constantly find compromises  <br/>\nwith that parent so the children&#39;s needs come first.  Eg - rearranging  <br/>\nschedules to accomodate playdates and sporting events of the kids  <br/>\netc., especially as they get older.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichele<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 14-Aug-10, at 11:59 AM, Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -=-my<br/>\n&gt; biggest fear was exactly what you write (that divorce is an<br/>\n&gt; unchangeable decline on all fronts, for both the parents and the<br/>\n&gt; children).-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Are you suggesting that the idea of decline is false?

I am 4 years in to a divorce, and have learned that  <br/>\nchildren desperately want their parents to love each other, respect  <br/>\neach other, and love them.  This can be easily done within a divorce.   <br/>\nThey want them together also, and this will always be a source of  <br/>\ngrief for them, as this is what definitely changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, all is not bleak, and I write this for those of you that read  <br/>\nthe links posted in Sandra&#39;s e-mail and feel despair.  In my case, I  <br/>\nhave embraced single motherhood, and after a couple of years in  <br/>\nschool, my children came back home to me and we all love it.  I work  <br/>\npart-time, have lots of energy for the kids, have a wonderful partner,  <br/>\nand the kids&#39; father and I are very respectful and co-operative when  <br/>\nit comes to the kids.  We compliment each other in front of the kids,  <br/>\nsupport each others&#39; decisions when it comes to child-rearing, and I  <br/>\nsee the kids blossom when they know that their parents still love each  <br/>\nother.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis does not negate the pressure the kids feel having to live in 2  <br/>\nhomes; with 2 sets of rules; 2 step-parents whom they will never  <br/>\naccept as their own (nor should they); constantly feeling a need to be  <br/>\nall-inclusive, feeling guilty if they enjoy their step-parents&#39;  <br/>\ncompany when the natural same-sex parent is not around.  It is a lot  <br/>\nof stress for the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, what I have taken from this, is that is does take 2 to make a  <br/>\nrelationship work.  That if only one is busting their butt to heal  <br/>\nwhat they can&#39;t even know is wrong within a relationship, although it  <br/>\nis heroic (many have complimented me on my perserverance in my  <br/>\nmarriage) and admirable, and many Christians remained my friend  <br/>\nbecause I wasn&#39;t the one who &quot;left&quot;, I often wonder why I didn&#39;t leave  <br/>\nearlier.  The writing was on the wall, and I&#39;m not sure how much my  <br/>\nkids benefitted from an extra year of their father being miserable at  <br/>\nhome, the unsaid tension as we all wondered what was wrong, my misery  <br/>\nat not being able to reach him and figure out a way through and back  <br/>\nto each other.
