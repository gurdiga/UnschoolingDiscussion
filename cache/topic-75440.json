It works that<br/>\n&gt; way for some people.  If a thing has been very limited, when it finally<br/>\n&gt; becomes available it takes a while for them to feel like they&#39;ve had<br/>\n&gt; enough. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He wouldn&#39;t eat sugar all day every day, forever. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My son has lived without restrictions on sweets, TV, movies or reading<br/>\n&gt; material.<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s a recent story. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Saturday we were expecting some friends and I made a chocolate cake.  <br/>\n&gt; Dylan had one piece of cake that day and hasn&#39;t had any since.   It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Tuesday and I still have half a cake.  It was a good cake too!&lt;g&gt;  No one<br/>\n&gt; here is desperate for sweets.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tonight he asked for brown rice and broccoli.  We have pop and potato<br/>\n&gt; chips in the house, corn chips and cake, but he hasn&#39;t selected those<br/>\n&gt; things.  He&#39;s never selected them steadily or to the exclusion of<br/>\n&gt; everything else.  Why would he?   With lots of choices why would he limit<br/>\n&gt; himself to one thing? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You clearly care about your family&#39;s well being.  Thinking about their<br/>\n&gt; ability to care about their own well being and happiness is a good thing<br/>\n&gt; too.   There is no reason to assume children want to have less happy or<br/>\n&gt; healthy lives than we hope they will have.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Deb L<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well...I have to admit...<br/>\nJulian has never had restrictions about what he can or can&#39;t eat, and there&#39;s <br/>\ngenerally sugar and other snacks in the house.  At the very least, Beth works <br/>\nfor Girl Scouts, so we always have a box or two around of GS cookies. There <br/>\nare also always fruits and veggies available. And Julian has always been (well, <br/>\nsince he was 3-4) an ethical vegetarian.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is also a sugar maniac, and will, in fact, eat sugar all day long. He also <br/>\neats other stuff, and it probably all works out to a not-unhealthy diet. If <br/>\nhe has a good filling meal at a restaurant he&#39;ll turn down dessert, even if <br/>\nthey&#39;re really good. But he frankly has a strong preference for sweet desserts <br/>\nover fruits and veggies. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, presentation is everything to this kid. If we hand him a <br/>\nplate with things artfully arranged, he&#39;ll give us an enthusiastic, &quot;Ooooo!&quot;  <br/>\nThis could be a peanut butter sandwich. <br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, I&#39;d say it works not restrict foods in any way. But he does eat lots <br/>\nof sugar and plenty of dairy. And he&#39;s rarely sick and has no food allergies.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75439,"nextTopicId":75445}}
