Many of them are quite bizarre, like the ferocious, blood<br/>\nspattered teddy bears and the tiny bunnies with cigarettes. We find a lot of<br/>\nour little Anime and Manga figurines at Puzzle Zoo stores (in the USA).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom James&#39; interest in collecting small Godzilla figures as well as anime<br/>\ndolls and miniature robots, he and Jayn have been slowly developing a<br/>\ncombination board game/role-playing game which they have called &quot;The Battle<br/>\nBetween Good and Evil&quot;. They range their figures on a large square of foam<br/>\ncore that we keep for the purpose. I know that part of the game has to do<br/>\nwith using a flashlight to cast shadows across the board, but how the rest<br/>\nof it works eludes me. Jayn and James will play this game for a couple of<br/>\nhours, and as far as I can tell there is never an end or a winner. <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW James is the &quot;Evil&quot; side and Jayn the &quot;Good&quot; using pretty figurines.<br/>\nEvery time we go out they are always on the look out for more characters for<br/>\ntheir game.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
