He<br/>\nis my 6yr old and I was just so disgusted with the fact that they had<br/>\nhomework, even in K. They had a packet to do every week, each night at<br/>\nleast one page and this is in prep for 1st grade. Plus a book report<br/>\nevery week. What good will that do a child that cant read on his own<br/>\nanyway? I was doing all the reading, then I had to help him figure out<br/>\nwhat he wanted to tell about the story (fav part or something) then I<br/>\nhad to help him write it. It was homework for me really. <br/>\nSo, I pulled him out and I thought I would work with him everyday on<br/>\nSOMETHING. Keep his mind moving, I guess. Now, with a little help and<br/>\nencouragement from a local mummy! I am laying off. If he wants to watch<br/>\nTV, ok. If he wants to play with legos and pretend that they are<br/>\nbattleships, ok. The more I lay off, the more I see bits of interest in<br/>\nthings. Its definitely a slow process, my kid is OBSESSED with TV.

Just wanted to share some thoughts and perhaps get a <br/>\nlittle support.... I have, for a long time, thought of myself as <br/>\nkind of an oddball, because I seem to think about things and see <br/>\nthings from a perspective that the people around me haven&#39;t even <br/>\nthought about at all! <br/>\n<br/>\nDo any of you have that kind of feeling? For example, in the public <br/>\nschool world, the way people assume that a certain score on a test <br/>\nindicates that learning has been achieved. I try to talk to friends <br/>\nabout this, and how it just doesn&#39;t add up to me, and they look at <br/>\nme like I&#39;m nuts, and who cares? And everyone&#39;s kids are required to <br/>\ndo it, so it must be right. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn example: Last year when my son was in Kindergarten the teacher <br/>\nsent home math tasks that were to be completed each week (on your <br/>\nhonor, as there was no work to be handed in). On Friday we were to <br/>\nsend in a sheet of paper, signed by both parent and child, stating <br/>\nwe had done the work, and circling a face to indicate our &quot;feelings&quot; <br/>\nabout doing it: happy, sad, or indifferent. <br/>\n<br/>\nI told the Kindergarten teacher I had a problem with that, and <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be doing it. I told her it made something that was very <br/>\nnatural for us (doing math around the house and in &quot;real life&quot;) very <br/>\nself-conscious and put rules and requirements on it that took away <br/>\nthe fun and spontaneity of it... and that it really didn&#39;t need to <br/>\nbe quantified or assessed anyway. She replied that it was important <br/>\nbecause in First Grade he would have homework every night and he <br/>\nneeded to get used to it... to get in the habit of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHomework in first grade??? This was my thought. Homework in first <br/>\ngrade??? Why isn&#39;t a 7-hour school day enough for a child of the age <br/>\nof 6? I mentioned this to some friends. &quot;Do you realize the test <br/>\nscores for our district are among the highest in this area?&quot; was one <br/>\nresponse. Like... don&#39;t question it, it must be right. Others just <br/>\nkind of looked at me blankly. Or, as another mom said, &quot;Yes, that&#39;s <br/>\ntrue. Kids do need to learn the habit of doing homework.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, we ended up moving out of that district, but I have stayed in <br/>\ntouch. And yes, the first graders have homework... about an hour <br/>\n*every* night. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;m ranting here. Just simply wondering if anyone else thinks <br/>\nthis is culturally embedded insanity.

Just wanted to share some thoughts and perhaps get a <br/>\nlittle support.... I have, for a long time, thought of myself as <br/>\nkind of an oddball, because I seem to think about things and see <br/>\nthings from a perspective that the people around me haven&#39;t even <br/>\nthought about at all! <br/>\n<br/>\nDo any of you have that kind of feeling? For example, in the public <br/>\nschool world, the way people assume that a certain score on a test <br/>\nindicates that learning has been achieved. I try to talk to friends <br/>\nabout this, and how it just doesn&#39;t add up to me, and they look at <br/>\nme like I&#39;m nuts, and who cares? And everyone&#39;s kids are required to <br/>\ndo it, so it must be right. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn example: Last year when my son was in Kindergarten the teacher <br/>\nsent home math tasks that were to be completed each week (on your <br/>\nhonor, as there was no work to be handed in). On Friday we were to <br/>\nsend in a sheet of paper, signed by both parent and child, stating <br/>\nwe had done the work, and circling a face to indicate our &quot;feelings&quot; <br/>\nabout doing it: happy, sad, or indifferent. <br/>\n<br/>\nI told the Kindergarten teacher I had a problem with that, and <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be doing it. I told her it made something that was very <br/>\nnatural for us (doing math around the house and in &quot;real life&quot;) very <br/>\nself-conscious and put rules and requirements on it that took away <br/>\nthe fun and spontaneity of it... and that it really didn&#39;t need to <br/>\nbe quantified or assessed anyway. She replied that it was important <br/>\nbecause in First Grade he would have homework every night and he <br/>\nneeded to get used to it... to get in the habit of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHomework in first grade??? This was my thought. Homework in first <br/>\ngrade??? Why isn&#39;t a 7-hour school day enough for a child of the age <br/>\nof 6? I mentioned this to some friends. &quot;Do you realize the test <br/>\nscores for our district are among the highest in this area?&quot; was one <br/>\nresponse. Like... don&#39;t question it, it must be right. Others just <br/>\nkind of looked at me blankly. Or, as another mom said, &quot;Yes, that&#39;s <br/>\ntrue. Kids do need to learn the habit of doing homework.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, we ended up moving out of that district, but I have stayed in <br/>\ntouch. And yes, the first graders have homework... about an hour <br/>\n*every* night. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;m ranting here. Just simply wondering if anyone else thinks <br/>\nthis is culturally embedded insanity. Or if it&#39;s me. <br/>\n<br/>\n:) Carly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":93802122,"authorName":"Tim and Maureen","from":"Tim and Maureen &lt;tmthomas@...&gt;","profile":"wisdom0007","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] thinking about unschooling","postDate":"1051244341","msgId":65731,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjQwMWMzMGFlMSRjZDAzYmYwMCQxODU1NDUxOEBjYS5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDE3MC4xZGE4Y2Y1Ni4yYmQ5YjAxN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65722,"nextInTopic":86481,"prevInTime":65730,"nextInTime":65732,"topicId":65692,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I live in Michigan and I`m thinking about taking my son out of <br/>\n<br/>\npublic school and home schooling him. He is not doing well in the <br/>\n<br/>\npublic school system. He is in fifth grade this year. He hates going <br/>\n<br/>\nto school. He has no friends and gets picked on every day. When he <br/>\n<br/>\nwas in second grade he was diagnosed with ADHD. Of course they put <br/>\n<br/>\nhim on Ritalin. His teachers said he walked around like a zombie. <br/>\n<br/>\nZoning out and daydreaming all the time. We decided to take him off <br/>\n<br/>\nthe medication. His teachers now say that he refuses to do any work <br/>\n<br/>\nand he blows up for what they say is no reason. I do not see this <br/>\n<br/>\nbehavior at home. He does his homework for me without a problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nUsually what happens is some kid picks on him, he asks them to leave <br/>\n<br/>\nhim alone and when they dont, he explodes. He has been suspended <br/>\n<br/>\ntwice for fighting. He always get blamed as well. They say he should <br/>\n<br/>\ncome and talk to them. But it doesn`t stop after they talk to these <br/>\n<br/>\nother kids. So he does not trust them to take care of it for him. The <br/>\n<br/>\nprincipal told us he needs to be put back on the medication. I feel <br/>\n<br/>\nthat what they want is a school full of zombies so they can easily <br/>\n<br/>\ncontrol them. I dont think medicine is the answer. He has had a few <br/>\n<br/>\nteachers that he has done real with. Who actually took the time to <br/>\n<br/>\ncare. And he loved going to see them. As far as friends, he has <br/>\n<br/>\nplenty of kids in our neighborhood he plays with. So socializing <br/>\n<br/>\nisn`t an issue either. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do <br/>\n<br/>\nand how to get started? I would appreciate any input I can get. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advane.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                   Nita</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":145425127,"authorName":"nita248","from":"&quot;nita248&quot; &lt;nita2483@...&gt;","profile":"nita248","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: thinking about unschooling","postDate":"1051221700","msgId":65718,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI4OW1zNCt2aGYxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNFQTg0QzNDLjYwNDA3MDRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":65715,"nextInTopic":65722,"prevInTime":65717,"nextInTime":65719,"topicId":65692,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... advice on what I can do and how to get started? ... describing, ... day. ... son ... from now ...

For me, that would be <br/>\nthe ONLY reason I would need to yank him out so fast the damn principal <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t know what hit him!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds like a classic case of a child in need of unschooling.  Once the <br/>\nbarriers and pressures are missing, he WILL flourish.  You will meet an <br/>\nentirely different boy. His confidence will soar and I&#39;m willing to bet the <br/>\nsigns of ADHD will fall to the wayside.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck to you, we&#39;re here if you decide to take the plunge!!!<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.

Ethnic or foreign if you <br/>\ncan.  Nice ones with ambiance and quiet.  Sit and talk.  Buy him magazines <br/>\nabout things he&#39;s interested in.  Buy him a new video game.  Rent some DVDs.  <br/>\nMake popcorn and cookies.  Kick back.  Relax and talk and just be with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132394532,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day!","from":"Have a Nice Day! &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"litlrooh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] thinking about unschooling","postDate":"1051206592","msgId":65696,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTAwMWMzMGE4OSRlODc3MzY3MCQ3YjdlNTI0NEBhby5sb3AuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGI4OTVuNCs2M3BsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65692,"nextInTopic":65701,"prevInTime":65695,"nextInTime":65697,"topicId":65692,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t live in Michigan, but I say...get him out of there asap.

I live in Michigan and I`m thinking about taking my son out of <br/>\n  public school and home schooling him. He is not doing well in the <br/>\n  public school system. He is in fifth grade this year. He hates going <br/>\n  to school. He has no friends and gets picked on every day. When he <br/>\n  was in second grade he was diagnosed with ADHD. Of course they put <br/>\n  him on Ritalin. His teachers said he walked around like a zombie. <br/>\n  Zoning out and daydreaming all the time. We decided to take him off <br/>\n  the medication. His teachers now say that he refuses to do any work <br/>\n  and he blows up for what they say is no reason. I do not see this <br/>\n  behavior at home. He does his homework for me without a problem. <br/>\n  Usually what happens is some kid picks on him, he asks them to leave <br/>\n  him alone and when they dont, he explodes. He has been suspended <br/>\n  twice for fighting. He always get blamed as well. They say he should <br/>\n  come and talk to them. But it doesn`t stop after they talk to these <br/>\n  other kids. So he does not trust them to take care of it for him. The <br/>\n  principal told us he needs to be put back on the medication. I feel <br/>\n  that what they want is a school full of zombies so they can easily <br/>\n  control them. I dont think medicine is the answer. He has had a few <br/>\n  teachers that he has done real with. Who actually took the time to <br/>\n  care. And he loved going to see them. As far as friends, he has <br/>\n  plenty of kids in our neighborhood he plays with. So socializing <br/>\n  isn`t an issue either. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do <br/>\n  and how to get started? I would appreciate any input I can get. <br/>\n  Thanks in advane.<br/>\n<br/>\n                     Nita<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
