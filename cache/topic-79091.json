It&#39;s perfectly understandable that <br/>\nmoving to unschooling is a major life change.  I think what people here <br/>\nare trying to express, that is not always understood or accepted, is <br/>\nthat we don&#39;t think people on the fence should encourage other people on <br/>\nor near the fence to *stay* on the fence.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this were a swimming list, the people in the water might coax the <br/>\npeople on the side of the pool &quot;come on in, the water&#39;s fine&quot; but it <br/>\nwould be rather strange if people on the side of the pool were coaxing <br/>\nthe swimmers to come out of the water.  :-)  That would be more <br/>\nappropriate on a sunbathing list or a staying-dry list than on a <br/>\nswimming list.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a swimming list one can assume that everyone wants to learn about <br/>\nswimming.  On an unschooling list one assumes that everyone wants to <br/>\nlearn about unschooling.  If someone on the fence or on the side decides <br/>\nthis list is too wet and splashy and they&#39;d rather stay dry, that&#39;s <br/>\nfine.  But hauling other people out of the pool and telling them to &quot;dry <br/>\nup&quot; wouldn&#39;t be fine. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure some fence sitters may decide that they don&#39;t like this list. <br/>\nThat&#39;s honestly okay.  I don&#39;t think one list can meet the list needs of <br/>\neveryone. People are too diverse for that. In the online community you <br/>\nmay have to &quot;kiss a lot of toads&quot; &lt;g&gt; before you find a list that you <br/>\ncan fall in love with.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":66835036,"authorName":"RJHill241@aol.com","from":"RJHill241@...","profile":"rjhill241","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] transition to unschooling","postDate":"1061427740","msgId":79092,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2My4yNGFkMDAxZS4yYzc1NzQxY0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":79091,"nextInTopic":79095,"prevInTime":79091,"nextInTime":79093,"topicId":79091,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/20/03 5:37:36 PM Pacific Daylight Time, ...
