He is usually asleep around 11.  After 9,  I keep all the lights in the house except a dim one so he starts to settle down.  We continue playing, reading books until he gets tired.  Then, he chooses a film and I breastfeed him while we watch the film.  He falls asleep and I transfer him to our bed.  If it is after 12, I close all the lights but leave his film on.  Then he falls asleep faster.  For him,  lightning seems to be very important.  He doesn&#39;t settle down unless it is dark.  I understand your frustration.  It has been very hard for me to let go of the idea that he should be in bed by a certain time.  Also, if I start to think of all the things I could do if he were in bed, I get frustrated.

You have all been so insightful and <br/>\n  inspiring.  I am also new to unschooling.  We have 5 children.  The <br/>\n  two oldest are in school dd14 and ds11.  Our last three will be <br/>\n  unschooled ds5, ds3 and dd16mths.  I have really begun to believe <br/>\n  that unschooling isn&#39;t just a method of homeschooling, but rather a <br/>\n  way of life.  This brings me to my concern.  We have always had a <br/>\n  specific bedtime for the kids.  Lately, however, it is increasingly <br/>\n  more difficul to keep the 3yr old in bed.  They go to bed between 9 <br/>\n  and 9:30, but he is still up and running at 10:30 or sometimes <br/>\n  later.  I try not to get frustrated with him, but it is not always <br/>\n  easy.  I let them get up in the morning on their own.  What are your <br/>\n  thoughts on letting kids go to bed when they want to when they are <br/>\n  young children?  Sorry if this seems really basic to most of you, but <br/>\n  like I said we are really new to unschooling.  I&#39;m still trying to <br/>\n  convince dh that unschooling is not just about education.  <br/>\n  Thank you<br/>\n  Jill  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
