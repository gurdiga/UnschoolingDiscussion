Do any of you have any information or first-hand <br/>\nexperience with unschooling in Colorado?  In particular, my main <br/>\nconcern in the state mandated testing.  We have none of that in CA <br/>\nand the thought of subjecting my kids to standardized tests is quite <br/>\nbothersome!  Any info is much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA - Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94796,"nextTopicId":94803}}
