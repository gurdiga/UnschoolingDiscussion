He explained that while he&#39;s <br/>\nbeen interested in Klingon (Star Trek language) for over a month now, that interest has <br/>\nexpanded to include the creation of any invented language. We went over the grammatical <br/>\nterms for tenses but I was quickly out of my depth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he wondered whether the &quot;th&quot; in &quot;the&quot; was voiced or unvoiced and what a &quot;fricative&quot; <br/>\nis. Having studied five languages, I did have a little familiarity with these terms, but I <br/>\nfound the precision of his questions and the insight he had from his six weeks of interest <br/>\nin Klingon to out strip even the smattering of knowledge I had.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, back when we were &quot;schooling at home&quot; he had done his &quot;Winston Grammar&quot; <br/>\nwith little interest and no retention. He hasn&#39;t studied any spoken foreign language. He <br/>\nchose ASL instead. (Interestingly, don&#39;t get him started on the idea that American Sign <br/>\nLanguage isn&#39;t a &quot;real language.&quot; He became passionate about defending the lingistic <br/>\nstructure and grammatical nature of ASL when he heard some colleges don&#39;t consider it a <br/>\n&quot;foreign language.&quot; He&#39;s studied it for three years.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYet now through the natural process of following his own interests, he&#39;s looking at <br/>\ngrammar more deeply (at the structural level - the composition of how language develops) <br/>\nthan he ever would have using some grammar program.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis unschooling life is just too fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
