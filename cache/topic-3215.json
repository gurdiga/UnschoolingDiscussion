She hopped on an <br/>\nAmtrak train and took it across the country to Oregon to visit a friend in <br/>\nEugene.  She had a three-stop pass and planned to stay with her friend, her <br/>\ncousin in L.A. and then to meet up with us at the end of our trip to Texas.  <br/>\nHer lodging expenses were nil and Amtrak was fairly inexpensive and she used <br/>\nher savings.  She loved traveling by train and watching the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nHealth insurance is really a pain.  She can be covered by an inexpensive <br/>\nprogram for six months out of the year (with a very high deductible) <br/>\naccording to state law, but the other six months we haven&#39;t faced yet and  <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s going to be handled.  Luckily she&#39;s very healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s been out to NJ twice in the last few months to visit a friend who has <br/>\ntaken her into NYCity a few times and up into New England a bit.  It&#39;s been <br/>\nwonderful--he was born and raised in Brooklyn and really knows his way around <br/>\n(he was amazed that she took out her billfold to get  money in a public <br/>\nplace, for instance--something that she wouldn&#39;t have thought twice about).  <br/>\nOnce she took the bus and the other time the train (train&#39;s her preference).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s home now (just pulled in last night!) and will resume work at a food <br/>\nco-op in town.  She&#39;s getting money together from that and other sources to <br/>\ntravel again in January, maybe a several-week trip this time.  She doesn&#39;t <br/>\nknow what she wants to do with her life in terms of supporting herself, but <br/>\nthen neither do a LOT of kids in college.  She has learned ENORMOUS amounts <br/>\nof things and has gained such poise.  That&#39;s certainly going to help her in <br/>\nany pursuit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I think of how this child was at the age of five--permanently affixed to <br/>\nme--it&#39;s nothing short of amazing that she&#39;s now gallivanting around the <br/>\ncountry!  <br/>\n<br/>\nDiane, does your daughter know where she wants to go?<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Strandbe@xxx.xxx","from":"Strandbe@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"OwUk4PuJzNIaAhOfFagbhN6wTOrXOx7_hdDxFhBMFTF04Mss4eAZJ_QiJAjvyT2b9V9Ol3IEew","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Alternatives to college","postDate":"938094286","msgId":3215,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMjEuMzIxNS45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3217,"prevInTime":3214,"nextInTime":3216,"topicId":3215,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter is presenting a workshop this Saturday on alternatives to college.
