My FIL just has to say someting <br/>\nnegative (which he sees as helpful advice) about *everything*.  His <br/>\ndad is the same way, and my husband has had to learn to see how <br/>\npainful it can be to children, including his own little child <br/>\ninside.  He&#39;s one of those that in the past would say, &quot;That&#39;s a <br/>\npretty tree you drew, but the trunk should be brown instead of <br/>\npurple.&quot; Yuck.  To his credit, he can now allow himself to feel the <br/>\npain of his dad&#39;s words so he can more clearly see that that&#39;s not <br/>\nwhat he wants to do to his kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust yesterday FIL was here looking at the frog house L & L (5yo)<br/>\nbuilt and he just had to take the wind out of their sails by <br/>\nsaying, &quot;You really should put some more grass in there,&quot; etc.  I <br/>\nhad to shoot him a look and say, &quot;I think the frog looks very <br/>\ncomfortable in there.  Lena and Liberty worked hard making the house <br/>\nand I can tell the frog appreciates everything they put in there.  <br/>\nDon&#39;t you think so, girls?&quot;  I don&#39;t know if that was the right <br/>\nthing or not, but I always feel like I have to undo those kinds of <br/>\nremarks.  <br/>\nAbby</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78615010,"authorName":"mamaaj2000","from":"&quot;mamaaj2000&quot; &lt;mamaaj2000@...&gt;","profile":"mamaaj2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"The Negativity","postDate":"1090435602","msgId":96625,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNkbWRtaSs2aDhiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":96631,"prevInTime":96624,"nextInTime":96626,"topicId":96625,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"MIL was here for a couple days, and oh, such negativity!
