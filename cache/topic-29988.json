You tell it the way it is <br/>\nfor you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving been brought up in the city and suburbs, I don&#39;t think I could <br/>\nbring myself to kill a little rabbit, however.  I have been too far <br/>\nremoved from nature and the farming life to have the experiences you <br/>\nspeak about, Julie.  One of my best friends grew up on a farm in <br/>\nIndiana.  She is full of wonderful stories of how her family made a <br/>\nliving.   They grow their own food and raise their own animals to sell <br/>\nand feed themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been going on for thousands of years.  We are carnivorous <br/>\nmammals.  If you don&#39;t believe me, look at your teeth in the mirror.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, we can sustain ourselves on soy products, vegetables, fruits, <br/>\nnuts, etc., as I did as a vegan for several years.  But, I prefer to <br/>\nfollow my more natural desire and inclinations which is to eat meat.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe in suppressing anything, and that includes my desire to <br/>\neat other living beings.  It is a very natural thing for us to do.  <br/>\nIsn&#39;t that what other carnivorous animals do?  We are at the top of the <br/>\nfood chain and we should not be ashamed of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n(Who has rescued at least 5 dogs, 20 cats and 3 birds.)  No, I didn&#39;t <br/>\neat them.  In the cultures which I grew up in, we don&#39;t eat dogs, cats <br/>\nor sparrows.  Well, actually, I do have an old friend, an old Greek guy <br/>\nwho I once saw steal baby sparrows out of their nest.  He took them <br/>\nhome, pickled them and ate them.  This same man was a little boy during <br/>\nWWII on a Greek island occupied by the Germans.  He told me many stories <br/>\nof how so many Greeks starved to death during the war and how he <br/>\nremembered eating grass roots to stay alive.  He saw these birds as a <br/>\ntreat and a delicacy.  I wasn&#39;t about to judge him, even though I was a <br/>\nvegetarian at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sunday, December 16, 2001, at 05:23 PM, Julie Stauffer wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We breed lots of animals and we have a plan for the babies.
