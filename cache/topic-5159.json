Unfortunately, the surfing culture has battled to<br/>\novercome the stigma of drugged out bums, and many people still have a<br/>\nnegative concept of the sport. Actually, professional surfers make quite<br/>\na good income, but I also want him to have a strong educational<br/>\nbackground. Besides, how long can ANY professional sports career last? I<br/>\nalso want to portray homeschoolers in an academic light, as many people<br/>\nhave an ignorant view of hsers as drop outs, or losers who can&#39;t cope<br/>\nwith life.
