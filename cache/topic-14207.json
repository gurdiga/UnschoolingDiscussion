(as I am quickly becoming<br/>\ncynical about the whole system and my kids have not<br/>\nentered it nor I hope ever will). Anyway it is my<br/>\nunderstanding that the school gets more money for kids<br/>\nwith learning disabilities.  The money may not be<br/>\nspent for that child very wisely or for that child at<br/>\nall. <br/>\n<br/>\nDefinetly important to get informed what her rights<br/>\nare as the parent. I would suggest she not let them<br/>\ntest him or do anything until she feels completely<br/>\ninformed.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if one has their kids in school things can be<br/>\nlooked at differently if we think of the teachers as<br/>\nresources rather than someone we need to &#39;obey. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t mean to disrespect the teacher or other<br/>\nofficials here I just mean to find a way as the parent<br/>\nto have the teacher help you rather than someone you<br/>\nhave to fight.  I think its difficult because I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink teachers/officials are entitrely honest about<br/>\nwhat they and the school are all about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps...The words I want to pass on is<br/>\nempower yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSamantha<br/>\n<br/>\nWho apologizes for posting w/o introducing myself yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Her son <br/>\nwas a preemie, and like all children, is developing at his own pace.  <br/>\nHe was held back for 1st grade last year & is now in second grade.  I <br/>\njust received a call from his mother very, very upset about his <br/>\nparent/teacher conference.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe child is tutored in reading by the school (high school students) <br/>\nand his mother spends literally hours with him at night on reading <br/>\nthe assigned material.  The school is telling her that her son is at <br/>\na beginning 1st grade reading level and they are planning on <br/>\nadministering a battery of tests including a physician&#39;s exam, <br/>\nlearning disability tests and a psychological evaluation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend is beside herself trying to deal with this and has, like in <br/>\nthe past, turned to me for some advice.  I&#39;m not sure anymore what to <br/>\nsay to her that could possibly help the situation; homeschooling is <br/>\nnot an option for them.  I am a firm believer in John Holt&#39;s advice <br/>\non learning to read on your own, when you are ready.  My hs&#39;d <br/>\nchildren have learned how to read on their own, at their own pace, <br/>\nand I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in search of practical advice or websites to pass along to her.  <br/>\nHer son used to excel in math but is now having trouble with the <br/>\nsimplest equations (6+2); he is very social, musically inclined and <br/>\nhas a terrific sense of humor.  In my eyes, he lacks very little for <br/>\nan 8 yo boy and they are being extrememly pressured by the school to <br/>\nmake him a second grade reader or they are going to label him as a <br/>\nlearning disability.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d so much like to give her real, useful, practical and caring <br/>\nadvice and I hope that some of you can help out here.  It is breaking <br/>\nmy heart to see people I care so deeply about going through all of <br/>\nthe things that our family has had the good fortune to NOT experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanking all of you in advance for any suggestions...<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n(loving mom to Jason (8), Angela (6), Daniel (3) and expecting in <br/>\nMarch!!!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14186,"nextTopicId":14215}}
