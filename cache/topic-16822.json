Very lovely thought, and beautifully put, Robin.<br/>\nMy great grandmother lived to be 104, and I didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow her that well, she died when I was still very<br/>\nyoung, but I have thought about that alot, especially<br/>\nwhen doing my family tree, and how most of my family<br/>\nwere living on a prairie somewhere, (heeh, straight<br/>\nout of Little House on the Prairie types) and they<br/>\nwere all perfectly nice &quot;sociable&quot; people, and passed<br/>\nit on. My ex husband said to me recently -regarding<br/>\nthe kids being unschooled- that they would be socially<br/>\nscrewed up then, cuz we were, and we were homeschooled<br/>\n(we met in 3rd grade at a private school)...I maintain<br/>\nthat any social problems we had had nothing to do with<br/>\nbeing homeschooled, but ideas about &quot;socializing&quot; that<br/>\nwere fed to us. My kids don&#39;t have any problem making<br/>\nfriends thus far, as long as they put what &quot;values&quot;<br/>\nthey do know into practice. They probably would much<br/>\nrather play with some of the kids from *back in the<br/>\nday* that were living on a prairie somewhere and being<br/>\ntaught at home how to grow into a loving good adult<br/>\nsomeday. le sigh.<br/>\n-Bobbie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

My great-grandmother lived to 100 and I<br/>\nknew her all my life. I often thought about these same things and talked<br/>\nwith her about them - what life is like when you&#39;re born in  a sod house on<br/>\nthe prairies of South Dakota and live to see a man rocket up to the moon and<br/>\nwalk around. She was a woman of great wisdom and heart and you&#39;re right that<br/>\nwe have no idea what we, or our children, will face in our lifetimes so it<br/>\nis a great gift to give them the ability to learn, grow, and adapt to<br/>\nwhatever circumstances they may find themselves in.<br/>\nI also often think of my grandmother&#39;s experiences in terms of the<br/>\n&quot;socialization&quot; question that always seems to crop up when you talk about<br/>\nhomeschooling. She was raised many miles from her nearest neighbors, with<br/>\nvery few children her own age to &quot;socialize&quot; with, other than her siblings.<br/>\nYet she was an amazingly social woman, active in her church and charities up<br/>\nuntil her death.
