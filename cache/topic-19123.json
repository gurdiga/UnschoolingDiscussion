Another idea would be to get them their own<br/>\nset and let them abuse it.  If they ruin or lose them,<br/>\ndo not replace them.  If they complain, remind them<br/>\nthat THEY decided not to care for their things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy four year old is often incredibly ostinate.  When<br/>\nhe has dumped his toys all over the floor and refuses<br/>\nto pick them up, we remove every toy he will not pick<br/>\nup to time out for a while (1 day, 2, or more).  We<br/>\ntell him that if he cannot care for them, he does not<br/>\nneed to have them.  He used to have the kids&#39; book<br/>\ncollection in his room, but whenever he got mad, he<br/>\nwould sweep clear the shelves into a big pile and<br/>\nrefuse to pick them up later.  I warned him that he<br/>\nwould lose the books, and they have been happily<br/>\nresiding in his brother&#39;s room for some time now.  My<br/>\nfour year old just recently got back the priveledge of<br/>\nhaving books to take to bed with him.  We have been<br/>\nmaking sure that all bedtime books are cleared away to<br/>\nthe other room before tucking him in for the night.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
