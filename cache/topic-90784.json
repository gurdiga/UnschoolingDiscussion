Lots of school teachers think that it is &quot;right&quot; in some more <br/>\nultimate sense, but it isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you had a hundred kids and were dividing them into 3 groups and you <br/>\nwanted to know how many kids should be put into each group, you might <br/>\ndivide by 3 and get 33.33333333 and decide to round down and put 33 <br/>\nkids in each group. There would be one kid left out and maybe glad (if <br/>\nthis was school - maybe glad not to have to be in a group? &lt;G&gt;) or <br/>\nmaybe sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven a teacher who had taught &quot;if the number ends in a digit less than <br/>\n5, round down&quot; for years would NOT round down in this situation &lt;G&gt;. <br/>\nAnd probably wouldn&#39;t even realize that what she/he was teaching <br/>\ncontradicted her/his own behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I can think of to follow up on with Patrick on his question, <br/>\nthough, would be that they&#39;d probably pay him $33.33 -- they probably <br/>\nwould not round up since, first just teachers always say round down if <br/>\nthe last digit is less than 5 and since it would be in THEIR best <br/>\ninterest to round down, anyway! If they had a hundred employees, how <br/>\nmuch would they save by rounding down for everybody? What if they had a <br/>\nthousand employees?
