I love seeing things like this unfold ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-253628496\">Hi all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI just posted this to my message boards, but no one really goes there, so I <br/>\nthought I would send it to the list. I love seeing things like this unfold <br/>\nbefore my eyes and wanted to share.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, Alex (5yo) was coloring the letters on a poster of the<br/>\nalphabet. The letters were arranged four to a row. He finished<br/>\nthe second row and asked, &quot;What do two fours make?&quot; After<br/>\nthe third row, he asked, &quot;What do three fours make?&quot; He<br/>\ncontinued this to the fifth row. When he finished the sixth<br/>\nrow, he surprised me by asking a completely different question. He<br/>\nasked, &quot;What do three &#39;two fours&#39; make?&quot; I was thinking about<br/>\nthe people who made the poster and their intent for it: to<br/>\nteach kids the alphabet. I am so glad I don&#39;t jump on<br/>\nopportunities like this to try to teach what is intended.<br/>\nInstead, we have tons of stuff like this and he goes through it<br/>\nwhen he feels like it and does what he wants with it. In fact,<br/>\nthe book that the poster came in was given to him at<br/>\nChristmas and he is just now going through it. If I had sat him<br/>\ndown at that time and worked with him on the letters, he may<br/>\nhave thought the book was supposed to teach him letters and<br/>\nnever given a thought to the math. I&#39;m also glad I give him<br/>\nexact answers to his questions, if I can. When he asks, &quot;What<br/>\ndo two fours make?&quot;, I answer, &quot;Eight.&quot; and not, &quot;Well, let&#39;s<br/>\ncount it and see.&quot;, or similar distractions to his line of thinking.<br/>\nJust think, one good intentioned, probing question could have<br/>\nswitched him away from exploring and enjoying multiplication.<br/>\nAs far as the alphabet goes, he did ask what 24 and 2 make<br/>\nand then told me there were 26 letters in the alphabet. He<br/>\nalso noticed the M and the W were the same, only facing<br/>\ndifferent directions. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheryl <br/>\nNicholas Academy Homeschooling Resources <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nicholasacademy.homestead.com\">http://nicholasacademy.homestead.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16404,"nextTopicId":16409}}
