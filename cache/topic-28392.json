Her advice and examples <br/>\nfrom her family&#39;s unschooling life have been of enormous help to me. <br/>\nAs she has said many and many and many a time, please let&#39;s discuss <br/>\nunschooling and get away from personalities. Which is what she has <br/>\ndone. When a person comes on here and says she is an unschooler, but <br/>\nrequires a small amount of schoolwork, and Sandra among others says, <br/>\nno that&#39;s not unschooling, then that is not attacking the person, <br/>\nthat is discussing unschooling and what it is and isn&#39;t. And it&#39;s <br/>\nhappened with lots of other people who&#39;ve joined the list with <br/>\nsimilar views of unschooling and how you can be an unschooler but <br/>\nstill require math/writing/reading/whatever. Some of them have <br/>\nlearned a lot from such discussions and have changed how they <br/>\nhomeschool because of the discussions. But when the person who got <br/>\nthat pointed out to her then gets a big chip on her shoulder and <br/>\nspends the next two months saying how she&#39;s been attacked on every <br/>\nissue discussed and mentions Sandra&#39;s name over and over, ad nauseum, <br/>\nthat&#39;s focusing on personality. There is a difference. <br/>\n<br/>\nPriss</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28391,"nextTopicId":28396}}
