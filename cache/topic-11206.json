In contast to her other academics, the repetition gave her some<br/>\nsuccess every day.  I know I did see alot of improvement in her math skills,<br/>\nbut I attribute some of that to the &quot;success&quot; issue.  Having the structured<br/>\nmath also offers some comfort to my husband, who is still a little leery of<br/>\nunschooling (which is better than when he thought I&#39;d lost my mind).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;needs to de-school, but she is so used to failure that if I don&#39;t give<br/>\n </span></blockquote>her<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;some type of academics that make her feel successful, it will just<br/>\n </span></blockquote>increase<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;her sense of failure.

And I have not addressed that with her<br/>\nspecifically.  I know she feels like a failure but it is in all areas, or at<br/>\nleast it carries over to all areas.  She was labeled severely ADHD in the<br/>\nfirst grade and it has been a long road, with some of the most ridiculous<br/>\nnightmares that were entirely unnecessary.  I withdrew her from public<br/>\nschool in April of her 5th grade year and then recreated the school at home<br/>\nfor 2-1/2 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the reason for the gasp -- Katrina was molested before she was six.<br/>\nAfter years of not remembering, she inadvertently learned of this a few<br/>\nmonths ago.  Her anger was frightening to behold.  She is more accepting now<br/>\nbut is also starting to have some memories.  I became so aware of the stress<br/>\nthat she was under that I began to really question and look at all the areas<br/>\nof her life, especially the academics.  At that time, they were taking so<br/>\nmuch time that they WERE her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing how much pain she was in, I tried to stop &quot;school&quot; at that point.<br/>\nShe absolutely insisted that we finish each and every textbook.  Well, we<br/>\ndid, but I stayed up nights to find shortcuts.  That&#39;s when I realized how<br/>\nridiculous the questions were on her tests.  Sheesh.  But I had to be really<br/>\ninventive to skip anything.  She would almost cry if she thought I was<br/>\npurposely trying to make something easier for her.    Maybe this was just<br/>\ntemporary, maybe she was just afraid to have anything else unfamiliar to<br/>\ndeal with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI apologize that this is so long.  This may not be appropriate for a list,<br/>\nand if so I am sorry.  I know that I have to follow my heart with Katrina,<br/>\nbut sometimes my heart feels very confused.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;If anyone has any experience unschooling after alot of damage has already<br/>\n&gt; &gt;been done, I&#39;d sure like any advice or thoughts you might have.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Physical activity helps immensely.

Katrina&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;social failures&quot; make her so anxious around others that team efforts don&#39;t<br/>\nwork well right now.  It is just so HOT right now, but I do want to give her<br/>\nmore opportunities in that area.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Cathy Henderson","from":"&quot;Cathy Henderson&quot; &lt;cathen@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"z5YK0c0mvT-jwlhlvhuTN8d1wdYFFMsvZtTXmo_DNNF8pJIRq82gklikHvRdfrSZugpc5AlsCJiRGz27aefCTc3McJvrOQhqFMzTzEO4Y8A","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] To Cathy -- was Re: Definitions","postDate":"963982014","msgId":11333,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxNTgwMWJmZjE0MSRkY2RiNmZjMCQwZTg2YWVjN0BhdHRjYy5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDAwNGQwMWJmZjEyYyQ0MDc0OTM2MCQ5MTIxMWJkMEBuZW9jb21tLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":11329,"nextInTopic":11334,"prevInTime":11332,"nextInTime":11334,"topicId":11206,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Cindy, thanks for the book suggestion.

My girl, Megan was <br/>\ndoubtful about it too, especially unschooling. She really thought that <br/>\nwithout assignments and tests and grades, she was not learning. The big <br/>\nbreakthrough for her was old movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had gotten into old movie musicals from the library and was watching <br/>\nthem all the time. One day I said, &quot;Hey, why don&#39;t you turn these movies <br/>\ninto school, and really learn something about them?&quot; The next time we went <br/>\nto the library she came out with a big stack of books on that era of movie <br/>\nmaking. I love these movies, too, so it was interesting for me to hear all <br/>\nthat she was learning. She really got into it-stuff about Judy Garland and <br/>\nhow she was mistreated as a child, the things that MGM did to the female <br/>\nstars was totally appalling. She learned alot about choreographers and <br/>\nmusic, followed up on the careers of some of the stars, found pictures and <br/>\nsongs on the net, oh, all kinds of stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis finally convinced her of the value of following her own interests. She <br/>\ndid more work on this project than she had ever done in school, and it was <br/>\nabout a topic she chose, not one that someone else said she needed to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also spent tons of time on the internet. She has made some really good <br/>\nfriends that way-in fact, she is now in Wisconsin on a campout with a bunch <br/>\nof these kids. She also learned more social studies than she ever did in <br/>\nschool just by talking to kids from other countries. She did alot with kids <br/>\nfrom Holland. She could tell me all about the country, not just dry <br/>\nstatistics, but what they learned in school, how much internet service and <br/>\nhouses and stuff cost, what the weather is like, things people do there, <br/>\ncrime and local news.  She knew time zones around the world-she could tell <br/>\nwhere someone was by the time on their icq message. It took me pointing out <br/>\nto her that this was educational-turning it into educational lingo-to show <br/>\nher that when she was having fun she was doing school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your daughter would like to meet her, let me know. She will be back from <br/>\nWisconsin in another week, and I&#39;m sure she would be glad to email your <br/>\ngirl.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Other than that, I am not really sure what we will do.  She desperately<br/>\n&gt;needs to de-school, but she is so used to failure that if I don&#39;t give her<br/>\n&gt;some type of academics that make her feel successful, it will just increase<br/>\n&gt;her sense of failure.  She will think she is not &quot;schooling&quot; because I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;given up on her or something.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If anyone has any experience unschooling after alot of damage has already<br/>\n&gt;been done, I&#39;d sure like any advice or thoughts you might have.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cathy<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Corallyn Berger","from":"Corallyn Berger &lt;hape2day@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"0OhFWJKRhp944pKvqRvr4Aenlp7gswZR518oShECgON4lTYIpAOJBtPXsrW-fKmZhxfsIgqnR8a6IeTjSVVfJyoIGgDzHRF2mWML","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] To Cathy -- was Re: Definitions","postDate":"963890432","msgId":11272,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNzE4MDMyMDMyLjE1MTgyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjkwMi5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11269,"nextInTopic":11276,"prevInTime":11271,"nextInTime":11273,"topicId":11206,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can relate to this being a graduate (just barely) of ps.

You could start by<br/>\n&gt; explaining to your child what you would like to do in<br/>\n&gt; way of homeschooling and see if she thinks it would be<br/>\n&gt; a good idea. Maybe plan some day trips to the zoo,<br/>\n&gt; museum, park, have a picnic. Things that you can do<br/>\n&gt; with your daughter that you would both enjoy and spend<br/>\n&gt; time together just bonding.

But for the moment she is watching alot<br/>\nof TV, doing alot of arts and crafts when she chooses.  In fact, &quot;she<br/>\nchooses&quot; seems to me to be the key.  Katrina has had alot of pain and has to<br/>\nheal.  She has also been far too controlled, yes by me too.  Sometimes I do<br/>\nfear it is too little too late, but this is where we are and so where we<br/>\nhave to start.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Corallyn Berger","from":"Corallyn Berger &lt;hape2day@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"-3_eWjN4qefRhfr_YRUkXRXNJGgQJElNJXT3Jy6dXk6wpjbljFpt_amrW2iJwmqJB3whZWyyNhgRrFoxomvmwsfODFJCOxEoQADp","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] To Cathy -- was Re: Definitions","postDate":"963862535","msgId":11248,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNzE3MTkzNTM1LjE0NTQ4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjkwMS5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11239,"nextInTopic":11260,"prevInTime":11247,"nextInTime":11249,"topicId":11206,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They just let their children choose<br/>\nthe activies they want whether it is t.v. reading etc.<br/>\nAfter a while though they become interested in more<br/>\nstructured i.e. educational things. You could start by<br/>\nexplaining to your child what you would like to do in<br/>\nway of homeschooling and see if she thinks it would be<br/>\na good idea. Maybe plan some day trips to the zoo,<br/>\nmuseum, park, have a picnic. Things that you can do<br/>\nwith your daughter that you would both enjoy and spend<br/>\ntime together just bonding. In the process of these<br/>\nactivities she will be learning about the animals,<br/>\nnature, and herself.
