Kids who use them are most likely to drown, in my<br/>\nopinion.  They do not understand how their body reacts with and floats<br/>\nin water.  If they ever did fall in without their floaties they would be<br/>\nunable to deal with the water, as they would feel different in the water<br/>\nwithout the swimmies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith great respect and admiration for Joylyn (and for Lexy and Jeanine).<br/>\nThis has not been our experience with floaties.  When they were very little,<br/>\neach of our kids was thrilled to be in the water without floaties as long as<br/>\nthere was a grown up right beside them (which was, say, half the time).  If<br/>\nthe grown up was helping another child, though, or &quot;life-gaurding&quot; from the<br/>\nside, they would wear a floaty- suit.  As they grew, they gradually gave up<br/>\nthe float suits because as they say &quot;you can&#39;t sink down in them!&quot; (duh,<br/>\nmom).  My youngest dd 3 1/2 still likes to wear hers b/c it gives her more<br/>\nindependence in the water.  We still watch her like a hawk *all the time she<br/>\nis in the pool* and she still likes her &quot;sink down&quot; suit when mom or dad is<br/>\nwith her.  She swims great but cannot stand with her head above the water in<br/>\nthe shallow end yet.  So being without the float suit tires her out pretty<br/>\nfast and she really would rather be in the pool much longer than that.  In<br/>\nour case, all of our children were capable of swimming well before they<br/>\nwanted to give up floaties altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can remember the first time each child fell into the pool accidentally (at<br/>\nabout 2yo for the older 2 and about 18 mo for the younger)  In all three<br/>\ncases, they were able to kick themselves up to the surface and get to the<br/>\nwall.  I was right next to them but did not interfere while they were doing<br/>\nok.  Anika loved this so much that from 12 months she would jump to me.  I<br/>\nwould not catch her but would guide her to the surface after.  She would<br/>\njump again and again and I never once &quot;caught&quot; her.  And she didn&#39;t want me<br/>\nto.  It was her game.  &quot;do again!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I write this the kids aree in the pool with dad for a little before<br/>\nbedtime swim.<br/>\n<br/>\nKrisula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93111,"nextTopicId":93340}}
