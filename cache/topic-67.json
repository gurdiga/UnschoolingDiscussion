We started off<br/>\ncollecting food waste from two stores and did this for seven days a week<br/>\nwith no payment, we discovered that we were saving them huge amounts of<br/>\nmoney when we started collecting from Econo-foods who wanted to pay us for<br/>\ntaking away their outdated produce and baked goods.   So we quit taking from<br/>\nthe cheapskates who looked on us as cockroaches.... it&#39;s odd the difference<br/>\nin the way we are treated now we get paid for doing a service, rather than<br/>\nthem looking at us as though they are doing us a favor by letting us take<br/>\ntheir trash!

It may seem a lowly profession, but I figure that over the years we<br/>\nhave saved at least 3,500 tons of waste from ending up in landfills to rot<br/>\nand pollute.   So Dick&#39;s idea of &quot;finding a worthwhile endeavor which you<br/>\nwould do for no payment&quot; and then hopefully being able to make a living from<br/>\nit in real unschooling fashion has worked for us.   The kids are all<br/>\ninvolved to a degree, depending on their ages, Stephanie [almost 5] and<br/>\nMadeleine [7 yesterday] help with opening some of the packaged items such as<br/>\nlettuce and yoghurt and feeding them to the chickens and collocting eggs,<br/>\nRhianon [12] does these jobs and helps feed the sheep and goats and milks a<br/>\ngoat and is in charge of public relations with the Hmongs when they come to<br/>\nbuy chickens, Nathan [almost 16] sorts the food waste from Econo-foods in<br/>\nthe warm weather [now Dick and I do that at Econo-foods] washes the barrels,<br/>\nmaintains the electric fence, raises steers and helps Dick with quite a bit<br/>\nof the heavy work.   He loves knowing that what he does makes a difference<br/>\nto the environment.    Rhianon is also our &quot;tour guide&quot; last year she took a<br/>\nschool group around the farm showing them the animals and explaining a lot<br/>\nof things to them, she also loves to do this with visitors, either<br/>\nunschoolers or &quot;normal&quot; people.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn summer we all help with the hay making... Steph and Maddi help by riding<br/>\non the hay wagon.....  This is the heaviest hottest work on the farm, and it<br/>\nfeels so good when you&#39;re done.   It amazes me to watch as Dick and Nathan<br/>\nthrow bales to the top of the wagon as I stack them,  Rhianon is the lucky<br/>\none who gets to drive the tractor.   Last summer we were racing the weather<br/>\nand I took the truck to one field to collect hay while Dick, Nathan and<br/>\nRhianon collected it from another, we got all but 15 bales in before the<br/>\nrain came.   I did another load single handed as Dick was bailing some more,<br/>\nthat&#39;s something I&#39;d prefer not to do again, getting up and down from the<br/>\ntractor, throwing and stacking the bales in that hot weather was not fun<br/>\n[til I was done].<br/>\n<br/>\nSome times because of the work load we don&#39;t have a lot of time spare for<br/>\n&quot;visiting&quot;, that&#39;s partly why we prefer visitors who want to be involved.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, if you are looking for a REAL experience and not just some<br/>\n </span></blockquote>manufactured<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; one, take a trip to meet the nice people at Winona Farm.

Little<br/>\ntwo year old Stephanie was better at chasing down piglets than many of the<br/>\nadults.  Dick doesn&#39;t expect much out of the little ones. My youngest<br/>\nhaving then just turned 11 wasn&#39;t expected to do much of the hard work, but<br/>\nhe joined even the two year old in collecting corn or the 10 yo in finding<br/>\npotatoes for dinner or eggs for breakfast. He also got to feed the chickens<br/>\nsome kitchen scraps which is very safe there.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI know Sue, Dick and Nathan will be glad to hear how much you liked their<br/>\nideas and the web page.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It&#39;s increasingly difficult to find people who want to give of themselves,<br/>\n&gt;their homes and their time to like minded &quot;friends.&quot;  Everyone is so<br/>\n&gt;suspicious, it breeds more distrust. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s funny, but because Dick doesn&#39;t charge anyone to stay in his home many<br/>\npeople think he has alterior motives. But he&#39;s one of the nicest people<br/>\nwe&#39;ve met. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I am beginning to see, however, that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;the Unschooling &quot;community&quot; seems to be a very open lot, with &quot;radically&quot;<br/>\n&gt;forward (or is it deliciously backward?) thinking.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm, I&#39;m not sure which would be the better term, but either way I like it.<br/>\n We would like to get back there, maybe in the fall as summer is pretty<br/>\nbusy right now, we just miss the place and the people so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nLois</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Thomas and Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Thomas and Nanci Kuykendall &lt;tn-k4of5@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"uEWWykpUJOettjM6ljflHjgNC-MAxRtFJubdyOVALMMMn4kMOpHcg_j29CcdTPcf0Ji7Gz405cNHdM9eWIh3JIneiuRzczE85bUgw3OcbgchpzjMD19mSgg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Winona Farm","postDate":"928288851","msgId":67,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMy42Ny45NTkyNjk3MzlAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":169,"prevInTime":66,"nextInTime":68,"topicId":67,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
