We were considering what it would take to move *if* <br/>\nmy husband found work there, so this was pretty early speculation.<br/>\nI&#39;m not too big on the idea of change myself, especially since it <br/>\nmostly falls to me to make it okay for my children who don&#39;t like <br/>\nchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth my husband&#39;s family and mine are in the Chicago area, and we <br/>\nhave always thought that we might go back there eventually. When I <br/>\nmentioned it again last night, my husband really jumped at the idea.<br/>\nThe advantage there would be that we have family who could help us <br/>\nwith looking for a home, moving, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea what area we would be looking at. The cost of living <br/>\nis higher in Chicago than Ohio, I know that, but I know that some <br/>\nareas are less expensive than others.  One of our big concerns would <br/>\nbe finding a school for our daughter, who does love school, but we  <br/>\nknow we are enormously lucky to have found a good fit for her in <br/>\nschool here.  When I think of the work involved in finding new <br/>\nmedical professionals, new gyms, new churches, new everything, my <br/>\nhead just about spins.  Still, in the long run it would be wonderful <br/>\nto be near family and be able to see them without a big production. <br/>\nAnd to be able to have them watch our kids some of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, my family lives not too far from O&#39;Hare Airport, and my <br/>\nhusband&#39;s family lives in the far south suburbs.  If anyone on the <br/>\nlist lives in the Chicago area, would you please e-mail me so I can <br/>\nstart collecting the information I need about local groups, <br/>\nregulations, etc.?  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nRenee</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26924,"nextTopicId":26929}}
