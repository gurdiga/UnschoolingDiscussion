I made frames out of old yard sticks, but I see them cheep at the dollar store ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-17227125\">Kimberly,<br/>\nYou will need two frames, like picture frames at least 8x10.  I made<br/>\nframes out of old yard sticks, but I see them cheep at the dollar store<br/>\nsometimes and they would work too.  You will need a dish pan, I actually<br/>\nuse a kitty liter pan ( never used for kitty )  because it&#39;s a little<br/>\nbigger and works better, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn one of the frames staple a piece of window screen so that it covers<br/>\nthe opening of the frame.  This is the mold and the other frame is the<br/>\ndeckle.  You want to staple the screen to the back of a store bought<br/>\nframe ( on the flat part ) <br/>\n<br/>\nTear up pieces of used paper, paper towels or even vegetable fibers. (<br/>\nonion skins )  Get creative if you want and add a little paint or food<br/>\ncoloring.  Different vegetable fibers add a little color too.  Put the<br/>\npaper into a blender with some water and pulverize it.  The goo you make<br/>\nis called a slurry.  Fill the dishpan part way with water and pour in the<br/>\nslurry.  Hold your mold, screen side up,  put the deckle on top of it. <br/>\nHolding the mold and deckle together dip them into the slurry.  Hold them<br/>\nlevel and lift them out.  This is where you just have to experiment.  It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matter if you have too much on the screen but it can matter if<br/>\nyou have too little.   The mash on the screen is called the wet leaf. <br/>\nSet the mold and deckle on a piece of news paper, and remove the deckle. <br/>\nPut a piece of newspaper on top of the wet leaf to act as a blotter. <br/>\nTurn the mold and newspaper blotter over and lay them face down on the<br/>\ntable.  Use a sponge to blot up any excess water through the screen. <br/>\nLift off the mold and put another newspaper blotter on the wet leaf.   <br/>\nAfter a few minutes, remove the blotters and iron the wet leaf  dry.  <br/>\nSave the news papers.  They dry and can be used again and again as<br/>\nblotters, or they can be added to your slurry  some time.  It sounds like<br/>\na lot of work but really it goes fast.  You can make several batches of<br/>\nslurry and a pile of paper in no time.  Just keep adding new slurry to<br/>\nyour dish pan until you have enough paper.  <br/>\nWe add all kinds of interesting things on top of the wet leaf before we<br/>\nblot.  Flower petals, onion skins, pepper, nutmeg, pine needles,<br/>\nwhatever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find that ink runs too much on your paper, dissolve some elmers<br/>\nglue in water and add it to the slurry in the dish pan.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast time, we sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the wet leaf and it turned<br/>\nout very interesting.  (  Beware of dogs! )  We might make our Christmas<br/>\ncards this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe left over slurry can be squeezed out, rolled into balls and left in a<br/>\nsunny window sill to dry.  They make great kitty toys.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun.<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tami Labig-Duquette","from":"&quot;Tami Labig-Duquette&quot; &lt;labigduquette@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ChMufgnkGwyT0TF0y_b3h6ht7Yv44EPOX0atsogjAq4iPmDpdyoo66HZEhCaOhvs5TtxDdwzqws8Or4GonoL8m2FouQ4fTMWxY8tYBHzGMZ4flX8-luwIA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1382","postDate":"998939198","msgId":23716,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxNTZBQ3RkbUg0czJBcHV5QWIwMDAxNmJiMkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":23712,"nextInTopic":23720,"prevInTime":23715,"nextInTime":23717,"topicId":23702,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We make all kinds of paper out of old newspapers and junk mail.
