Are the kids being<br/>\n&gt; presented with opposing viewpoints on environmental issues so they can<br/>\n&gt; decide for themselves or are they being fed a single viewpoint?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To someone who feels environmentalism is too obvious to be questioned,<br/>\n&gt; presenting kids with the causes of acid rain and the effects of acid rain<br/>\n&gt; would seem to be giving them a complete picture. (Of course, since schools<br/>\n&gt; divide information into neat compartments, it *is* a complete *science*<br/>\n&gt; picture. Since it&#39;s a science class they can&#39;t discuss the economic or<br/>\n&gt; political aspects of the issue. Those must be confined to separate<br/>\nclasses.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But if the kids were being presented with an obvious conservative point in<br/>\n&gt; government class, such as gun ownership is a constitutionally mandated<br/>\nright<br/>\n&gt; clearly stated in the second amendment, and it was suggested they all<br/>\nwrite<br/>\n&gt; to their congressional representative about preserving that right, I<br/>\nsuspect<br/>\n&gt; liberals would find it appalling. It would look like mind control. It<br/>\nwould<br/>\n&gt; look like a state trying to mold an entire generation of future voters<br/>\n&gt; towards a single viewpoint. It wouldn&#39;t look at all like kids asking their<br/>\n&gt; congressional representative to represent them. It would look like someone<br/>\n&gt; getting all the kids in the state to follow a single political agenda. It<br/>\n&gt; would look really really scary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But anytime kids are fed a single viewpoint it&#39;s scary. Unfortunately<br/>\n&gt; schools weren&#39;t designed to offer information with more than one view<br/>\npoint.<br/>\n&gt; How many viewpoints can their be to 5+12 and here&#39;s how to spell &quot;cat&quot;?<br/>\nThey<br/>\n&gt; weren&#39;t designed to teach kids how to think, how to weigh issues, how to<br/>\n&gt; come to their own conclusions. The were designed to give kids a basic<br/>\n&gt; framework of practical math, reading, writing, some history.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The information schools impart has expanded well beyond that, but the<br/>\n&quot;just<br/>\n&gt; memorize the facts&quot; approach and mentality hasn&#39;t changed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I bet you were expecting a slew of &quot;Boy, I agree with you, what a nut<br/>\n&gt; case!&quot; ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joyce<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
