I saved all of the <br/>\nresponses and I had to read them and reread them. Thanks everyone for all the <br/>\nthoughtful advice. I have decided to back off for now as she is a little <br/>\nfreaked. And I figured since I cant do anything until it happens again , that <br/>\nI&#39;ll  try not to pry on her too much. As for the tampon situation I had no <br/>\nintention what so ever to allow them as I myself had some serious problems <br/>\nwith them , I guess my system is just too sensitive and I know everyone is <br/>\ndifferent but......well I&#39;m just not comfortable with it. I am going to go <br/>\nout and purchase some of the books mentioned and just put them away until I <br/>\nthink she wants them then Ill just leave them in her book box. I have calmed <br/>\ndown and everyone on this list has been a big  help as far as that is <br/>\nconcerned. Thankyou Thankyou. <br/>\nIm sure that this might be my first Mom Moment , but it wont be the last!!! <br/>\nCarol if your reading this . Your post had me  balling. sniffling and <br/>\nlaughing all at the same time. so here is a great big Hug. &lt;&lt;&lt;                <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">                                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And one for all us mothers who will lose our babies ...but not our children.<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;                                                                &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Again Everyone<br/>\nTamie<br/>\nA little more relaxed.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8067,"nextTopicId":8080}}
