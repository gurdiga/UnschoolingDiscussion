The parents were a little strange, and James Thurber makes it a sweet story.  The part that&#39;s always stayed with me was the father&#39;s theory on how to find the most efficient and time-saving way to get a job done (the father was a time-saving engineer or some such title).  His method was to ask the lazy workers, on the premise that the lazy person has already found the quickest, easiest way to get his work done so he can get back to being lazy.  The way it was presented, laziness was a virtue and finding a way to have more free time on one&#39;s hands was an enviable thing.<br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

It has been about 15 years since I last read my mother&#39;s copies but<br/>\nI remember it being similar to the Anne books in tone - perhaps with a<br/>\nlittle more sadness woven into the stories in places.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are reading the Chronicles of Narnia at the moment - slowly. We are on<br/>\n&quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; which seems to me to have the most odd<br/>\nadventures. The last book might be a bit heavy for sensitive kids -<br/>\nespecially the betrayals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought the Mary Poppins series by P.L. Travers, because Jayn loves the<br/>\nmovie and I was interested in the original material. Mary Poppins turns out<br/>\nto be an extraordinarily vain, rather mean and grouchy woman, whom the<br/>\nchildren are always treading very warily around. Sure they do some cool<br/>\nthings - but she just seems awful. The kids seem quite fascinated by her -<br/>\nand cowed also. I felt like she was using her magic to manipulate their<br/>\nminds. How sad for the mother when in the first book (the only one I have<br/>\nread so far) the son Michael screams to his Mom that Mary Poppins is the<br/>\nonly person he loves in the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had read part of it to Jayn before she fell asleep, then I finished it<br/>\noff. The next day I asked Jayn if she wanted me to read some more, and she<br/>\ntold me she had put it back into her library, which I see as fairly clear<br/>\ncode for &quot;no&quot;. I think it is just too different from the movie for Jayn to<br/>\nlike it - especially the whole main plotline with the father&#39;s emotional<br/>\njourney which is absent from the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember liking the Heidi books as a child. There are three: &quot;Heidi&quot; by<br/>\nJohanna Spyri, and &quot;Heidi Grows Up&quot; and &quot;Heidi&#39;s Children&quot; both by Charles<br/>\nTritten, Johanna Spyri&#39;s translator. I think they capture Heidi (and Peter<br/>\nof course) as adults rather sweetly. I like the Shirley Temple version of<br/>\nHeidi also, even though there are naturally some departures from the book.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My kids definitely prefer the most earnest kind of stories right now.<br/>\nFor TV, we have lousy reception and they watch videos/DVDs almost<br/>\nexclusively. Little House on the Prairie has been a huge hit, especially<br/>\nwith the 3yo and 7yo.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDid the new show include the scene from the book where Pa beats Laura with a<br/>\nbelt? Does the show include the endless misery that Laura feels all through<br/>\nher childhood from constantly being compared to Mary, her lack of self<br/>\nesteem and belief in her own &quot;badness&quot;? Did they show Ma&#39;s rigidity and<br/>\ncontrolling nature - not to mention racism? What a shock I got when I read<br/>\nthe whole series (that I picked up from a vendor last year&#39;s Conference at a<br/>\ngreat bargain) since it had always been touted as a &quot;wonderful&quot; example of<br/>\nparenting and home schooling. Maybe *in comparison* to the standards of the<br/>\ntime. I consider those books to be historical documents giving interesting<br/>\ninformation about how people lived, and the unremitting physical labor they<br/>\nundertook, but as a treatise on gentle parenting (as I had been told) - no.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe TV series from the seventies turns out to have only the most tenuous<br/>\nconnection to the books, and Pa (Michael Landon) in that is a lot kinder to<br/>\n&quot;Half Pint&quot; when she makes mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
