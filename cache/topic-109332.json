So..............I broke down and <br/>\nbought him a curriculum.  So far he has worked on two math lessons and <br/>\ntwo social studies lessons.

Him and I would <br/>\nsit on the couch for hours reading books that we got from the <br/>\nlibrary.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do think that some of his deeper reasons had to do with his public <br/>\nschool friends because I have heard their conversations and they seem <br/>\nextremely worried that he is ruining his life by not doing &quot;school&quot;.  <br/>\nHe always has some great unschooling comebacks that they stutter at <br/>\nanswering back.  The wonderful thing is that he is free to explore the <br/>\ncurriculum if he wants and free to ignore it if he wants; if something <br/>\nsparks his interest and leads to other things then great, whatever.

These kind of<br/>\nissues are explored often at unschoolingbasics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a hard time with anyone thinking that allowing a child to<br/>\nexplore their interests in freedom is &quot;dumbing them down&quot;!! <br/>\nMemorizing a set of facts is preferable to creative thinking...HOW?<br/>\n<br/>\nGood that your child doesn&#39;t know the same things! GOOD!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe shouldn&#39;t. No one on earth should have the exact same body of<br/>\nknowledge...we are UNIQUE individuals, with different purposes for our<br/>\nlife journey. Why on earth should we know the same thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only place in life that anyone is supposed to have the same body<br/>\nof knowledge is that false environment we call school. Where else in<br/>\nlife is anyone expected to know ALL the exact same things?  Some of<br/>\nour areas of knowledge overlap other people&#39;s, but I don&#39;t know ANYONE<br/>\non this earth with the exact same knowledge I have.<br/>\n<br/>\nRejoice that your child doesn&#39;t know a bunch of trivial BS that is<br/>\nmeant to shut down creativity, trap people in dead end jobs and rob JOY. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo me a favor, and go to starchildstudio.com. Go to the &quot;links&quot; page<br/>\nand visit some of the sites on creative thinking. THOSE are the<br/>\nimportant traits in life...the ability to adapt your knowledge, the<br/>\nability to learn, the ability to THINK. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone posted the &quot;traits of success&quot; recently. Could someone point<br/>\nher to that list? It has NOTHING to do with the body of &quot;knowledge&quot;<br/>\nbeing taught in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":138863959,"authorName":"D C","from":"D C &lt;deanacarpenter@...&gt;","profile":"deanacarpenter","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"what to do","postDate":"1131187405","msgId":109332,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMTA1MTA0MzI1LjIxNjkzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjMzNzA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":109335,"prevInTime":109331,"nextInTime":109333,"topicId":109332,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"my 12 yr old was upset today because his public school friend was talking about his homework, and my son wasn t familiar with some of the 7th grade curriculum ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-632201916\">my 12 yr old was upset today because his public school<br/>\nfriend was talking about his homework, and my son<br/>\nwasn&#39;t familiar with some of the 7th grade curriculum<br/>\nand concepts that his friend was talking about. always<br/>\nhaving been the &quot;brain&quot; between the two, my son didn&#39;t<br/>\nlike being ignorant this time.
