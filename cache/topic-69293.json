Without school<br/>\nand its teams and its us-vs-them and its power-plays by kids who are<br/>\npowerless to control much else, there wouldn&#39;t be as much of this kind of<br/>\ncrap going around. I think most &quot;isms&quot; - racism, sexism, whatever-ism are<br/>\nbasically plays by the powerless to control *someone* else, to put *someone*<br/>\nelse lower than themselves. By unschooling, by freeing kids from being<br/>\nraised in an environment of powerlessness, we stop so much of this. My kids<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t think of putting down someone else, it just wouldn&#39;t occur to them<br/>\nto do so. My kids take each person they meet at face value, they don&#39;t have<br/>\nto learn to judge them by outward characteristics because such things don&#39;t<br/>\nmean much unless you&#39;re in a prisonlike powerless environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the very act of unschooling combats racism. The very act of being<br/>\nwith my kids every day and being able to share my own values with them,<br/>\ninstead of having them learn values of the oppressed and the opressor in a<br/>\nschool is freeing them from this vicious cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if we do nothing else to &quot;save the world&quot; (and I sincerely doubt that<br/>\neven one person on this list doesn&#39;t do other wonderful, beneficial things<br/>\nas well), unschooling is breaking the chains of the &quot;isms&quot; of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3899762,"authorName":"coyote&#39;s corner","from":"&quot;coyote&#39;s corner&quot; &lt;jana@...&gt;","profile":"calourojm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"SuAnne Big Crow","postDate":"1053043105","msgId":69293,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA5YjQwMWMzMWIzZCRlMDBkOWY1MCQ2NTAxYThjMEBBb3Blbj4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":69385,"prevInTime":69292,"nextInTime":69294,"topicId":69293,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This thread started over a book I recommended Through Indian Eyes, or a site - in any case, a book, Indian in the Cupboard is listed under Books to Avoid ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-793242022\">This thread started over a book I recommended &quot;Through Indian Eyes, or a<br/>\nsite - in any case, a book, Indian in the Cupboard is listed under &quot;Books to<br/>\nAvoid&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat led us to discuss racism.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot convince you that racism against American Indians is alive, well<br/>\nand accepted much more than is admitted or perhaps recognized.<br/>\nI do know racism when I see it (or read it)<br/>\nWhen I spoke of the terrible things done to American Indians, I was speaking<br/>\nof things that have happened in my life time.

We must have gas, electricity, indoor<br/>\nplumbing. In cases of mixed marriages, most often the children go w/ the<br/>\nnon-Indian parent - even if the parent has proven him or herself to be<br/>\nabusive.

SuAnne was a full member of the team by then. She was a<br/>\nfreshman, fourteen years old. Getting ready in the locker room, the<br/>\nPine Ridge girls could hear the din from the fans. They were yelling<br/>\n fake-indian war cries, a &quot;woo-woo-woo&quot; sound. The usual plan for the<br/>\npre-game<br/>\nwarm-up was for the visiting team to run onto the court in a line, take a<br/>\nlap or<br/>\ntwo around the floor, shoot some baskets, and then go to their bench at<br/>\ncourtside. After that, the home team and then the game would begin. Usually<br/>\nthe Thorpes lined up for their entry - more or less according to height,<br/>\nwhich meant that senior Doni De Cory,<br/>\none of the tallest, went first. As the team waited in the hallway leading<br/>\nfrom<br/>\n the locker room, the heckling got louder. The Lead fans were yelling<br/>\nlike &quot;squaw&quot; and &quot;gut-eater.&quot; Some were waving food stamps, a<br/>\nreference to the reservation&#39;s receiving federal aid. Others yelled,<br/>\n&quot;Where&#39;s the<br/>\n cheese?<br/>\nThe joke being that if Indians were lining up, it must be to get commodity<br/>\ncheese. The Lead high school band had joined in, with fake-Indian<br/>\n drumming<br/>\nand a fake-Indian tune. Doni De Cory looked out the door and told her<br/>\nteammates, &quot;I can&#39;t handle this.&quot; SuAnne quickly offered to go first<br/>\n her place. She was so eager that Doni became suspicious. &quot;Don&#39;t embarrass<br/>\n us,&quot; Doni told her. SuAnne said, &quot;I won&#39;t, I won&#39;t embarrass you.&quot; Doni<br/>\ngave her the ball and SuAnne stood first in line.<br/>\nShe came running onto the court dribbling the basketball, with her teammates<br/>\nrunning behind. On the court, the noise was deafeningly loud. SuAnne went<br/>\nright down the middle; but instead of running a full lap, she<br/>\nsuddenly stopped when she got to center court. her teammates were taken by<br/>\n surprise, and some bumped into one another. Coach Zimiga at the rear of the<br/>\nline did not know why they had stopped. Su Anne turned to Doni De Cory and<br/>\ntossed her the ball. Then she stepped into the jump-ball circle at center<br/>\ncourt, in front of the Lead fans. She unbuttoned her warm-up jacket, took it<br/>\noff, draped it over her shoulders, and began to do the Lakota shawl dance.<br/>\n SuAnne knew all the traditional dances she had competed in many powwows as<br/>\na<br/>\n little girl and the dance she chose is a young woman&#39;s dance, graceful and<br/>\nmodest<br/>\nand show-offy all at the same time. &quot;I couldn&#39;t believe it she was powwowin&#39;<br/>\n like, &#39;get down!&#39;&quot; Doni De Cory recalled. &quot;And then she started to<br/>\n sing.&quot;<br/>\nSuAnne began to sing in Lakota, swaying back and forth in the<br/>\njump-ball circle, doing the shawl dance, using her warm-up jacket for a<br/>\nshawl.<br/>\nThe crowd went completely silent. &quot;All that stuff the Lead fans were<br/>\nyelling - it was like she reversed it somehow,&quot; a teammate said. In the<br/>\nsudden<br/>\nquiet, all you could hear was her Lakota song. SuAnne stood up, dropped her<br/>\njacket,<br/>\ntook the ball from Doni De Cory, and ran a lap around the court dribbling<br/>\nexpertly and fast. The fans began to cheer and applaud. She sprinted to<br/>\n the basket, went up in the air, and laid the ball through the hoop, with<br/>\nthe<br/>\nfans cheering loudly now. Of course, Pine Ridge went on to win the game.<br/>\n&quot;It was funny,&quot; Doni De Cory says, &quot;but after that game the<br/>\nrelationship between Lead and us was tremendous. When we played Lead again,<br/>\nthe<br/>\ngames were really good, and we got to know some of the girls on the team.<br/>\n<br/>\n Later, when we went to a tournament and Lead was there, we were hanging out<br/>\nwith<br/>\nthe Lead girls and eating pizza with them. We got to know some of their<br/>\nparents, too. What SuAnne did made a lasting impression and changed the<br/>\nwhole situation with us and Lead. We found out there are some really good<br/>\npeople in Lead.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nFrankly, I do not see how I can stay on this list.<br/>\nI feel it would, in some way, be agreeing with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will speak no more of this, wasichu<br/>\nCoyote teaches woman<br/>\n<br/>\n _________________________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69463,"nextTopicId":69561}}
