He looked at me and said &quot;that&#39;s <br/>\nterrible, why would she do that&quot;  There was also laughing in the background <br/>\n(supposed to be like the child deserved it) he said &quot;That isn&#39;t funny&quot;  I <br/>\nagreed. I like that my boys are shocked and find it hard to imagine those <br/>\nsituations.

Some of it is just adventure/romance, and some is at least <br/>\nas graphic as romance novels.   Maybe it&#39;s for and by girls, though, I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo nights ago I wanted to play Destruct-o-Match on Neopets.  Both Marty (14) <br/>\nand Holly (11) play Neopets, and I have an account (just so I can play that <br/>\npattern-falling cascading game myself without having to ask Marty) and our <br/>\nMac Powerstrip we use to get to recent files, recent programs, recent sites <br/>\nwas FULL of porn stuff.  I didn&#39;t open any, the titles themselves were gross <br/>\nenough.    OH!!  I had wanted to get to Netflix to cancel getting a DVD I had <br/>\njust rented (which didn&#39;t work).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell anyway, usually I use it to get to Neopets games page.<br/>\n<br/>\nI called Marty in, and said &quot;Marty, this is a bit much.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said &quot;Most of it was pop-ups mom, I didn&#39;t really look at it all much.  <br/>\nJust some.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked him if he could cover those kinds of trails over so I didn&#39;t have to <br/>\nknow and so Holly wouldn&#39;t accidently see.  I said he needed to open a bunch <br/>\nof CLEAN websites and look at some better stuff so that would be on the <br/>\ntrail.   He told me he could delete the trail.  I said I didn&#39;t think he <br/>\ncould, that I had even asked Leon, one of the developers, who said it only <br/>\nworks on the Mac OSX version, not 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Marty is a teenaged boy, so besides his porn curiosity he has a computer <br/>\nfacility.  And he figured out a three-step process to erase that list through <br/>\nInternet Explorer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I say &quot;NO, never ever even look,&quot; I risk losing the communication we have <br/>\nwithin which he will just tell me what he&#39;s seen and knows and where it came <br/>\nfrom.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that story has gone two days now.  At first he was embarrassed and &quot;Mom, <br/>\nokay, I know, don&#39;t talk to me about it anymore.&quot;  So I said I wanted to talk <br/>\nto him one more time the next day, about whether he knows the reasons people <br/>\nobject to kids looking at porn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day came and had nearly passed without me remembering, when he came <br/>\nand said, &quot;Okay, mom.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You wanted to talk to me about porn.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh!  Thanks.  I hadn&#39;t remembered.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I asked if he knew the objections.  He said no.  I said, &quot;In all your <br/>\nreading and listening you haven&#39;t heard objections to porn?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, that its illegal for me to see it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked to him about degradation of women, about creating unhealthy and <br/>\nunreasonable expectations in marriages, and that normal sex wasn&#39;t like that. <br/>\n He said &quot;Well, DUH, mom!&quot;  I said some people were messed up by WANTING it <br/>\nto be.  He seemed surprised that that could happen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI told him that some of those who are filmed are not quite volunteers and <br/>\ntold him two stories, one of the mom of girls his age he&#39;s known his whole <br/>\nlife, who was photographed as a kid for posed stills which were sold out of <br/>\nOklahoma.  It was shocking for him, and I don&#39;t know much detail, but naming <br/>\na person he knew who had been victimized was effective.    I told him of a <br/>\ndrug dealer and illegal snake importer my younger half-brother had taken up <br/>\nwith some years back, who videod him and his then-girlfriend, and used it as <br/>\nblackmail (she was from a Mormon family) to get them to deliver drugs for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I said I didn&#39;t think it was the most horrible thing people could do, to <br/>\nlook at pictures, but he REALLY needed to be careful because it&#39;s illegal and <br/>\nI didn&#39;t want the county coming to talk to me about anything they were doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I had a similar moment with Holly later that evening about going outside in <br/>\na teensy fancy t-shirt and nylon pajama pants, no shoes, in January, while <br/>\nshe has a sore throat.   &quot;Illegal,&quot; I told her, for parents to allow that, <br/>\nand let&#39;s not draw attention to a loose lifestyle by being outside in the <br/>\ncold without proper attire.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI told Marty that women tend to prefer word-porn and so they don&#39;t get <br/>\ncaught, but pictures were easy to find and more offensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him one danger was obsession.  I didn&#39;t go into that much, because <br/>\nsome of the original arguments about obsession were the cost.  I did have a <br/>\nfriend years ago who had a large collection of porn videos that had cost him <br/>\n$60 to $80 apiece.  Had he had the internet, his obsession wouldn&#39;t have <br/>\nruined his finances, nor left a mountain of evidence to shock his mom.   <br/>\n(That friend had a sex change operation since then, so I think it was his way <br/>\nof dealing with deeper psychological and biological situations, and that was <br/>\nway too much to tell Marty.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I asked him if he had ANY idea how much trouble some other boys his age <br/>\nwould get into if their parents caught them having looked at that kind of <br/>\nstuff on the computer.  He said &quot;Lots?&quot;  I talked about loss of computer <br/>\naccesss, grounding, and physical spanking by some big grown man.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said he had been mostly embarrassed when I first talked to him because he <br/>\nhad had friends in the house.  They couldn&#39;t hear us, but he had to leave <br/>\nwhere they were, talk to me, and go back in there, and it just embarrassed <br/>\nhim.  I said in those worst-case situations, the parents would have called <br/>\nall of the friends&#39; parents, said to come get them, told them why, and some <br/>\nof THEM would have been grounded and in trouble just for hanging out with <br/>\nsomeone who had looked at porn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt he really fully believes me on those things, or maybe he can&#39;t fathom <br/>\na parent doing that to a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind having a kid who can&#39;t readily imagine being hit by an angry, <br/>\ngrown man or can&#39;t imagine being told &quot;You stay in your room for a month and <br/>\ndon&#39;t even touch a computer.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone who has read this far and is offended, I didn&#39;t mean to throw this <br/>\nout to offend anyone.  It&#39;s a candid, current situation involving a real teen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd usually the trail on this real teen&#39;s internet use has Neopets, AoN (a <br/>\nrole-playing game), humor sites, and in-person friends&#39; journals.   People <br/>\nwho know Marty wouldn&#39;t think of him as a nasty kid.  He&#39;s not.  He is coming <br/>\ninto adulthood, though, and he&#39;s curious.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think similar to make-up, if it is declared &quot;only for adults,&quot; and a girl <br/>\nwaits and waits and WAITS until she can use it and is then unlikely to just <br/>\nlet it go unused, a boy who is slapped away from any glimpse of nudity until <br/>\nhe&#39;s eighteen is GOING to immerse himself in his newfound access for a while <br/>\nthe moment he gets a chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith and I were out grocery shopping, and talking about Kirby turning <br/>\nseventeen this year.  I said I used to want to have a big eighteenth birthday <br/>\ncelebration for him, like a graduation, but I no longer want to do that.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to declare an end to his learning, nor to his living with us if he <br/>\nwants to stay.   Keith said he had no ideas either, but that was fine.  Said <br/>\n&quot;Well, I&#39;m not going to get him drunk and take him to a whorehouse, so <br/>\nthere&#39;s probably going to be no rite of passage.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby wouldn&#39;t want any of that anyway.  ANOTHER good thing.  When he turns <br/>\neighteen, he&#39;ll have more legal rights, but there won&#39;t be the effect of huge <br/>\ntension released.  He&#39;ll have no restrictions suddenly lifted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know this won&#39;t suit everyone&#39;s belief system, but it is working with us to <br/>\nproduce mature, calm, considerate, communicative teenaged boys.  They&#39;re not <br/>\nangry with us, they&#39;re not reactionary, they&#39;re not sneaky.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55546,"nextTopicId":55343}}
