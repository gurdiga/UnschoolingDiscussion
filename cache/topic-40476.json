I find most of<br/>\n&gt; what he writes to be interesting and backed by his knowledge of history. I do<br/>\n&gt; not have to agree with someone entirely in order to recognize persuasive<br/>\n&gt; argument presented in an eloquent and witty manner. What I do find insulting<br/>\n&gt; is the fact that Sandra feels compelled to pull apart every post he sends<br/>\n&gt; (and the posts of many others) in order to find nitpicking faults. I think<br/>\n&gt; her suggestion that he find another list to be obnoxious in the extreme. Did<br/>\n&gt; I miss the coronation where she became Queen of the List? Perhaps she should<br/>\n&gt; seek out the &quot;Get a sense of Humor&quot; or the &quot;Get a Life&quot; lists.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sherry<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks, Sherry.
