We build <br/>\nwhile I&#39;m watching BBC America, Changing Rooms, to get some ideas on <br/>\ndecorating and I don&#39;t feel so stressed out.  Then hubbie does the 2nd clean <br/>\nup with Zak just before Max goes to bed and then hubbie and Zak pull out <br/>\nsomething to play with (I&#39;m not around for that part as I work in my office). <br/>\n Hubbie and I clean up any left overs when Zak goes to bed.  This seems to <br/>\nhave been working for us.  It&#39;s not perfect and I&#39;m learning that&#39;s ok, but I <br/>\nat least feel it&#39;s somewhat tidy for some of the day, especially when I&#39;m <br/>\nsitting with my tea watching Changing Rooms.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other problem of the hubbie is a different kettle of fish.  My husband <br/>\nhas a problem with me not cleaning the bathrooms.  I refuse to do it, so he <br/>\nhas to.  He&#39;s tried to go more than a week but can&#39;t so he ends up cleaning.  <br/>\nI think it&#39;s who it means the most too ends up doing it, unless you both care <br/>\nabout it the same.  Hubbie likes a tidy house as much as I do so it&#39;s not a <br/>\nproblem.  However getting him to move things from the kitchen counter and <br/>\nputting them in their proper place is another matter and as long as it <br/>\nmatters more to me than him I guess I&#39;ll continue doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen things get to where I&#39;m annoyed it&#39;s definately time for a sit down chat <br/>\nwith hubbie about how I&#39;m feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NumoAstro@aol.com","from":"NumoAstro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"XwsZkTncWZrpaV1F7yVNlkYfJCae_ltUYLe8wF8bQNkgM62_SZ-TCBuwD6Npgceor1K_RvSCgXY","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 690","postDate":"963938908","msgId":11304,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVlLjdmYzFjY2UuMjZhNWU0NWNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11305,"prevInTime":11303,"nextInTime":11305,"topicId":11304,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/18/2000 4:41:06 AM US Mountain Standard Time, Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1025833691\">In a message dated 7/18/2000 4:41:06 AM US Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; you might check with your local ag extention<br/>\n office and see if their is a local 4-H&#39;er that would &quot;mentor&quot; your son when<br/>\n he first gets his rabbit.
