You could contact different <br/>\nchurches and see when their Bible schools are.  I don&#39;t think the <br/>\nCatholic churches usually do Bible schools, but protestant churches <br/>\ndo.  Bible schools typically have games, crafts, snacks, Bible <br/>\nstories, and music.  They usually go all out decorating and sometimes <br/>\neven have things like puppet shows too.  I&#39;m partial to Group&#39;s hands <br/>\non Bible school curriculum, so if you find a church that uses that <br/>\nGroup for Bible school it&#39;s almost guaranteed to be a fun time.  You <br/>\ncould actually call around to different churches and say, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nlooking for a church to send my daughter for Bible school this summer <br/>\nand I&#39;m looking for someone who&#39;s using Group curriculum for their <br/>\nBible school program.  What program do you use?  Here&#39;s what they <br/>\nwill be doing if they use Group:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.groupvbs.com/\">http://www.groupvbs.com/</a>  Of course <br/>\nthere are other programs out there that are great too.  One church I <br/>\nknow does science experiments at their VBS every day.  Another had a <br/>\nwestern theme when we went two years ago.  They taught the kids how <br/>\nto square dance, played cool games and made neat crafts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea, if you want more to do on your own is to purchase <br/>\nGroup&#39;s hands on curriculum.  You don&#39;t have to sit down and <br/>\nhave &quot;class&quot;, you can just use it as a fun resource book.  If you <br/>\nhave a Christian book store near you, you  could probably find other <br/>\nactivity books with craft ideas to go with different Bible stories. <br/>\nHere&#39;s the page for the group curriculum: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.grouphobc.com/default.htm\">http://www.grouphobc.com/default.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf she&#39;s specifically interested in the crucifixion story, sometimes <br/>\nchurches put on neat Easter plays.  You could call around and see <br/>\nwhat types of Easter programs the different churches are putting on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I am NOT supporting being involved in &quot;church&quot;.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink it&#39;s necessary.  You don&#39;t have to attend every week.

As one subscriber to this list attached to her posts&quot;What you<br/>\n&gt; are shouts so loudly in my ears I cannot hear what you say&quot; Emerson.<br/>\n&gt; It just seems to me that if children witness their parents LIVING what<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; believe, they will be more likely to live similar choices.. I am having<br/>\n&gt; trouble articulating this. If the choices of TV, reading, media or events<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; limited, how will they ever think to make the choices for themselves? I<br/>\nthink<br/>\n&gt; of Sandra&#39;s chocolate milk analogy, how will they choose white milk if<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t allowed to have chocolate?<br/>\n&gt; If a person lives their spirituality and celebrates it and discusses it<br/>\n&gt; openly, then the child will see that.

As one subscriber to this list attached to her posts&quot;What you <br/>\nare shouts so loudly in my ears I cannot hear what you say&quot; Emerson.<br/>\nIt just seems to me that if children witness their parents LIVING what they <br/>\nbelieve, they will be more likely to live similar choices.. I am having <br/>\ntrouble articulating this. If the choices of TV, reading, media or events are <br/>\nlimited, how will they ever think to make the choices for themselves? I think <br/>\nof Sandra&#39;s chocolate milk analogy, how will they choose white milk if they <br/>\naren&#39;t allowed to have chocolate?<br/>\nIf a person lives their spirituality and celebrates it and discusses it <br/>\nopenly, then the child will see that.
