She said she never saw any ones rated X (never saw them, not saw them<br/>\nbut didn&#39;t look).  I believe the web owner monitors the stories well.  I<br/>\nknow that she had written down the words to a song in one of her stories and<br/>\nthey deleted the whole story because she plagerized the song by not telling<br/>\neveryone where she got it from.  She realized afterward what she had done<br/>\nwrong, but she wished they only deleted that chapter.  She learned a lesson<br/>\nin plagerization and in backing up her work.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe came up with a similar problem when she first got interested in Anime.<br/>\nShe would go to people&#39;s Anime websites and send them email telling them<br/>\nthat she liked their websites.  When you send email from my computer it<br/>\nsends it from Outlook Express, which is my email.  She got a reply from one<br/>\nperson who sent her Manga (Japanese drawings of human figures) that I didn&#39;t<br/>\nlike.  It was erotic, but not explicit.  I deleted the message.  I told her<br/>\nthat she got an answer and I told her that I deleted it and why.  She was ok<br/>\nwith that.  That only happened one time, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Until a few months ago, many sections of Fanfiction.net had X-rated (or &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>NC-17-rated) stories.
