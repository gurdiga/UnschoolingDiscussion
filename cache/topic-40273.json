He worked to unite the twelve tribes<br/>\nof Israel (from the twelve sons of Jacob who was called Israel) which<br/>\nwere scattered about the land.  Saul became jealous of David after the<br/>\npublic acclaim from killing Goliath and tried to kill him twice. David<br/>\nand fled to the south which was the land of the tribe of Judah. THe<br/>\nnorthern tribe of Israel and the southern tribe of Judah were separated<br/>\nby pagan cities whom they warred with.The other  Hebrew tribes were<br/>\nscattered about them. The Philistines killed Saul and David who had been<br/>\ngetting stronger armies was anointed king of Judah and defeated the<br/>\nPhilistimnes again and united the tribes. TRibe of Israel never liked<br/>\nthat. <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid moved the capital for the first time to Jerusalem (after battling<br/>\nits pagan inhabitants). He had the strong backing of the tribe of Judah<br/>\n(from whence comes the name of the religion: Judaism) but united and<br/>\nruled all the Israelites  in their lands as king. and conquered<br/>\nneighboring land too expanded his kingdom. His son Solomon expanded it<br/>\neven further as an Empire, ruling neighoring lands. After Solomon&#39;s<br/>\ndeath, Israel and Judea split apart again and the rest of the tribes<br/>\ntook sides with them. They were rivaling kingdoms until Israel fell to<br/>\nthe Assyrians. About 45 years later, Judah was taken by the Assyrians as<br/>\nwell. This whole period was that of the prophets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s more or less what is recorded.
