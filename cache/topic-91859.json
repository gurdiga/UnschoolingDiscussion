I counted 25 cents as a quarter of an hour of <br/>\ntime spent in an educational endeavor. EVERY day I tried to keep track, <br/>\ndown to the 15 minutes level, of what the kids were doing and then I <br/>\ntyped it into my accounting program that night. The &quot;budget&quot; categories <br/>\nwere things like: history, reading, writing, science, pe, and so on - <br/>\njust regular school subjects.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat lasted about a week --- that&#39;s how long it took me to realize that <br/>\n&quot;learning all the time&quot; meant learning ALL the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that I tried keeping just some notes about things I happened to <br/>\nnotice they were doing, throughout the day, that seemed to fit <br/>\nespecially well into school subject categories. That was useful for <br/>\nhanding to my husband one time when he complained they weren&#39;t doing <br/>\nanything.

English, Math, Science etc.  Then you&#39;re only looking for these subjects to write about and that will make it difficult for you see the learning that occurs everywhere.<br/>\n========================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree it can be difficult if you separate your life into subject categories on a daily basis--this is one of my beefs about reviewing with my county here in MD. Knowing that the review is looming around the corner, I feel those subject headings clogging my brain. To go from unschooling to reporting is a major translation process, translating everything we do just *living* into neat subjects, definable categories and measurable learning. I hate doing that, but I&#39;ve been *inside* education for so long that it comes relatively easily once I sit down to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been setting up my website so that those categories are in place and I can just add stuff once in a while instead of looking at life in those terms everyday. My blog is just a daily log of our life--not really necessary, but something I wanted to do to play with the technology and keep up with all the stuff available online. Plus, I think it&#39;s a really useful tool to demonstrate what unschooling really looks and feels like in a way that my website doesn&#39;t do. There&#39;s a definite tension between living (what&#39;s presented in my blog) and translation (what&#39;s presented at my website)--making my life seem kinda schizophrenic. But I&#39;ve tried to create something that&#39;s useful to me in multiple ways--I have records for my reviews, I have a place to point skeptical family members, and maybe I have a place that will help reassure those with young kids who are just beginning their unschooling journey.  Maybe if I show how things translate, it will help others relax a bit and not feel that they have to worry about that everyday. I think it&#39;s useful to show unschooling with young kids since so many stories tend to be about older kids, and I think it will be neat to see how things evolve as the kids get older.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do want to emphasize that I&#39;m not trying to set myself up as some kind of expert or definitive model, just creating a web-based artifact of *our* unschooling journey. I really believe that unschooling looks different for different families.This is what it looks like for us right now, which I&#39;m sure will change dramatically as life goes on. The web just offers an interesting and useful set of tools to document our journey. What I do see as really interesting are the ways in which my kids engage in all kinds of learning, some of which looks academic because they&#39;ve never been turned off to it. They come to it all on their own because they are living rich and inquisitive lives in which they are free to pursue whatever they choose. They learn stuff in so many different ways instead of being limited to just one or two or put off from questions that are too advanced. That&#39;s what always amazes me--the richness and breadth of their experience without some academic puppeteer controlling and ordering the bits and pieces of information available to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW--my new website is up and working.

And I don&#39;t just write in what seems &quot;educational&quot;, I write anything - whatever they&#39;ve been doing, interesting tidbits of our conversations etc.  And not: &quot;today he did nothing but play video games&quot;.  I write what game he was playing, what he likes about it (likely gleaned from our conversations), what he finds challenging about it (ditto), anything I find interesting about it etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried daily and monthly entries and I think I prefer the monthly view.  I will make quickie entries during the month about things that went on so I don&#39;t forget them, but then at the end of the month I pull it all together.  Looking over a month I get a better sense of which activities they delved deeper into, what they led to, which conversation likely led to something a week later, and it even becomes more obvious how seemingly disparate activities tied together for them.  You can make the connections.  For example, how the interest in the book he&#39;s reading this week was likely sparked by the video game he played last week.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if I get the knawing feeling that they don&#39;t seem to be doing much, or seem to be stuck in a rut doing the same thing constantly, a monthly overview always shows me that I&#39;m wrong.  It shows me that subtly over the month the focus of the activity has progressed in some direction.  The learning just seems to jump out at me!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband reads then to help him get a sense of what is going on with the kids on a deeper level; it&#39;s hard for him to see the flow of connections when he only sees them evenings and weekends.  I also send them to my Mom and she says she really enjoys reading them.  I think it helps her see that learning does not need to look schoolish to happen.  How topics you never imagined can show up just by living joyfully.  And I think it gives her a sense of connection to them and a better understanding of who they are as human beings, not students.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113787562,"authorName":"Mark and Rheta Wallingford","from":"&quot;Mark and Rheta Wallingford&quot; &lt;wallingford@...&gt;","profile":"belnvivmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Journaling unschooling days","postDate":"1079150651","msgId":91859,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM0MDhiMCQzZGJhMWM5MCQ3NmQwMDVjZkBXYWxsaW5nZm9yZD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":91862,"prevInTime":91858,"nextInTime":91860,"topicId":91859,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is it a good idea to keep a journal of what you and your children do every day - or does it cause a problem for people who are new to the concept of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-260524325\">Is it a good idea to keep a journal of what you and your children do<br/>\nevery day - or does it cause a problem for people who are new to the<br/>\nconcept of unschooling and are trying to stop their brains from<br/>\ncompartmentalizing each little thing under an educational label?  <br/>\n <br/>\nRheta Wallingford<br/>\nLooking for a reputable contractor?
