I am <br/>\nexcited to look into all of it. I am happy to be a part of this <br/>\nwonderful site, and have been enjoying all the posts for a while <br/>\nnow. It is so refreshing to be a part of something, where I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to explain myself or my reasons for doing what I am doing. I <br/>\nreally want to get my husband on board, but he just does not &quot;get <br/>\nit&quot; yet. I have tried explaining unschooling to him, but it seems <br/>\nlike we never finish a conversation. He seems to like what the kids <br/>\nare doing, and I always point out to him what the kids learned on <br/>\nthier own, but every once in a while he will &quot;test&quot; the kids by <br/>\nasking them questions he thinks they should know the answer to. It <br/>\nreally frustrates our 11 year old. Like the Algebra thing, my <br/>\nhusband thinks that my son needs to know all this other stuff before <br/>\nhe can learn about Algebra, and Jesse is just &quot;curious&quot;. I asked my <br/>\nhusband to explain it to him, but he won&#39;t because he does not know <br/>\nhow to, and feels he needs to know &quot;more&quot; before he tackles it. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t blame my husband for being the way he is, he has not had the <br/>\ntime to learn about unschooling, or even the desire. He just leaves <br/>\nit up to me. Once in a while though, he feels the need to &quot;see&quot; what <br/>\nthey are doing, and I wish I could get him to stop. (him and <br/>\neveryone else in my family). <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry, I just purged a little too much! Sometimes I do that. <br/>\nAnyway, thanks again for the response. I look forward to chatting <br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93191,"nextTopicId":93285}}
