They thought that works were also important and that <br/>\nsomeone could lose their salvation even if they still &quot;trusted in <br/>\nChrist.&quot; Here&#39;s at one of the portions of the Bible that they <br/>\nbased that on, and there were others:<br/>\n<br/>\nJames 2:20 - 24: You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith <br/>\nwithout deeds is useless? Was not our ancestor Abraham considered <br/>\nrighteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the alter? <br/>\nYou see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his <br/>\nfaith was made complete by what he did. And the scripture was <br/>\nfulfilled that says, &quot;Abraham believed God and it was credited to him <br/>\nas righteousness,&quot; and he was called God&#39;s friend. You see that a <br/>\nperson is justified by what he does and not by faith alone. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso James 2:26 As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith <br/>\nwithout deeds is dead.<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nI&#39;m not a Christian and don&#39;t buy into this or into &quot;trusting in <br/>\nChrist&quot; so you don&#39;t need to argue the point with me.

Not many, but a few. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy DH&#39;s step-father is a preacher, and compares the Bible to the internet - people can find things in both places to prove or disprove almost any view. You just have to get down to the bare-bones truth, no matter what the subject is. As for the Bible, you can&#39;t get away from the fact that it says you do have to believe in God and Jesus to be &quot;saved&quot; and go to heaven. It also commands that people should help each other, respect each other and basically treat each other right and good, not doing things like lying, stealing, and hurting others.
