When I first became ill in 1993, I was very<br/>\n&gt; weak and had trouble even washing off the kitchen table.  After weeks of<br/>\n&gt; feeling this ill, I went to see my family doctor.  He thought that I had a<br/>\n&gt; bone spur in my shoulder so he sent me to a neurosurgeon.  The neurosurgeon<br/>\n&gt; did and MRI and then told me that I had MS.  He pointed out &quot;plaques&quot; on the<br/>\n&gt; MRI and said that I would have to go see a neurologist, since his specialty<br/>\n&gt; was surgery.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The plaques should be investigated but you can&#39;t tell from a single MRI<br/>\nif there is a progression in number or size of plaque(s). This is why it<br/>\ncan take yrs to get dx. It has to be tracked over a few yrs to see a<br/>\npattern of attacks and an increase or enlargement of plaque(s).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Well, it took weeks to get my appointment, and by the time I<br/>\n&gt; did, I was feeling almost back to normal (except for the numbness and<br/>\n&gt; tingling in my arms).  The neurologist refused to take the neurosurgeons word<br/>\n&gt; for it and said that I had diagnosed myself!  He said that he could see<br/>\n&gt; nothing wrong with me and that I was healthy as a horse.  He did say that my<br/>\n&gt; blood pressure was extremely, extremely low (which probably, according to<br/>\n&gt; him, cause the dizziness, weakness and other symptoms) so he said I should go<br/>\n&gt; home and start eating alot of salt!   Well, I have tried (since new symptoms<br/>\n&gt; have come and gone in the last few years---vision, problems with my legs,<br/>\n&gt; pain and many others that I would really rather not go into) to see other<br/>\n&gt; neurologists.  They always refuse to do any more MRIs or any other tests, and<br/>\n&gt; instead hinted that all of this is in my head.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately this is typical.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;However, with all the pain I<br/>\n&gt; had (and some other symptoms that cannot be faked), I knew this wasn&#39;t so.<br/>\n&gt; Finally a reumatologist said that since my killer T-cells were extremely low<br/>\n&gt; and I had all the &quot;pain points&quot; that he thought I had CFIDS and Fibromyalgia.<br/>\n&gt;  That has become my &quot;official&quot; diagnosis, even though a couple of my symptoms<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t match the criteria---and basically has my doctor very concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Could you get a referral to an MS specialist from the Rheumatologist?<br/>\nthis may hold more weight than one from a GP.<br/>\nAt least you may be able to rule out MS. Have your eyes been checked by<br/>\nan Opthamologist? They can tell if you&#39;ve had episodes of Optic Neuritis<br/>\nwhich is difficult for even a neurologist to see.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyway, I have tried everything on my own, change in diet, natural medicine<br/>\n&gt; and herbs, but nothing has helped.  Your info on the MRIs has been the first<br/>\n&gt; I heard.  I have been told that my first MRI was &quot;nonconclusive&quot; (they said<br/>\n&gt; that they could see &quot;something&quot; but weren&#39;t convinced that is was plaques like the neurosurgeon said) and that they could see no reason for another MRI, even though it has been a few years. They also said that since I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have a conslusive MRI that I didn&#39;t have MS and there was no need to be<br/>\n&gt; retested.   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh what crap...if they don&#39;t track and the neurosurgeon saw plaques who<br/>\nare they kidding? Plaques are obvious with today&#39;s MRI machines. The<br/>\nplaques that do show up are considered large because they are 2 mm or<br/>\nlarger to have shown up in the first place.<br/>\nI will tell you this though ... the majority of auto immune disorder<br/>\npatients I&#39;ve had personal contact with have had to fight like hell to<br/>\nbe treated decently and honestly.<br/>\nAn informed patient has to tread carefully so as not to bruise doctors&#39;<br/>\negos and get the treatment they deserve!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Therefore, I grasped at the diagnosis of CFIDS and<br/>\n&gt; fibromyalgia----at least then I have a diagnosis!!-----and I have quit going<br/>\n&gt; to doctors for a diagnosis.  Now the only doctor that I see is my family<br/>\n&gt; doctor---who I like very much-----and he treats me for the pain and other<br/>\n&gt; symtoms.  I figure that if it is something like MS, I will have to wait until<br/>\n&gt; it is so obvious that it hits them over the head!  In the meantime, I will<br/>\n&gt; just try to help myself as much as possible!<br/>\n&gt; Tammy<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>MS isn&#39;t a life threatening disease just a pain in the a** disease.<br/>\nIt&#39;s something one can live with if one has too. Very few MS patients<br/>\nare non ambulatory.....80% walk into their doctors for their regular<br/>\nappts and of the 20% that don&#39;t, the majority of them only have to use a<br/>\nwheel chair occasionally and just have to use crutches or a cane for the<br/>\nmost part.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuzz<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; PERFORM CPR ON YOUR APR!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!

Nothing showed on the<br/>\nMRI so it couldn&#39;t be MS.<br/>\nI asked for a second opinion after 2 yrs of grief from this guy. The<br/>\nsecond opinion  fellow said the neurological tests and the problems with<br/>\nmy eye post Optic Neuritis were more than enough tohave diagnosed MS two<br/>\nyrs previous to my visit to him. <br/>\nHe sent me to a specialist at the MS clinic here in town at the McMaster<br/>\nUniversity Medical Centre who thought the same as the second Neuro and<br/>\nwas pleased to say I had no lesions but he truly felt I had MS and told<br/>\nme to my face that I have MS.<br/>\nHe was convinced enough to give me a Rx for a drug to help with<br/>\nfatigue....a drug that only works on fatigue in MS patients....it works<br/>\nfor me so there is another chalk mark to say MS (unfortunately)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen two out of three Neuros say you have it and one is a well known<br/>\nspecialist....then you have it even without the MRI&#39;s say so.<br/>\nIf this Neuro of hers doesn&#39;t believe in CFS she should get another<br/>\nopinion.
