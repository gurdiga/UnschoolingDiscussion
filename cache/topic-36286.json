We were not required to test this year but we did last year and will be next year. It also requires parents to have a college degree to homeschool the high school years.  If no degree is possessed (which we don&#39;t) then we must go through an *umbrella* (I think they call it) school.  We are approaching high school in the upcoming year and have a Christian school in the town near us to work through.  My question is, Do any of you have these requirements?  I was just wondering how to deal with the grades that must be submitted to the school ever so often.  We don&#39;t do much paper and book work except Math and occasionally grammar.  <br/>\nI know he can ace most tests that they give although next year we will be testing through the school we go through instead of the state.  I&#39;m just wondering how to handle all the paper work that will be required during the course of the year.  I know some states don&#39;t have such strict guidelines for homeschoolers but maybe some of you have dealt with this and can give me some advice.<br/>\nThanks again for the support and encourgagement I get from the group!<br/>\nBetty in TN<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36262,"nextTopicId":36196}}
