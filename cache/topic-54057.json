At least I used to.  I am by no means a neat freak.  But I have<br/>\n5 kids under 13, 4 dogs, 27 chickens, 6 rabbits, 6 goats, and a cat.  Things<br/>\nget very messy both in the house and outside.  My kids are also very active<br/>\nand need to be driven here and there (x 5), read to (x4), lunches fixed<br/>\n(x4), baths given (x2), etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to keep up with the kids stuff and to keep us from being over run with<br/>\nfilth (not mess, but filth), I was running full out, non-stop from 7am to 11<br/>\nor 12 at night, day in and day out.  I was exhausted and I started to resent<br/>\ndoing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally I had a talk with the family about how I know that having a livable<br/>\nhouse isn&#39;t a priority for them but to be honest, things that were important<br/>\nto them weren&#39;t always a priority for me.  That I wanted to be able to take<br/>\nthem places and do things but all my time and energy was being taken up,<br/>\npicking up after the family.  The kids understood.  I still have to ask but<br/>\nrarely get a flat out refusal to help, although I often get offers to help<br/>\nin ways other than what I&#39;ve suggested.  Example:  Adriane, would you please<br/>\nfold that basket of clothes?  Yuck.  How about I give Michelle a bath<br/>\ninstead?
