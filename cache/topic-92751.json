Anyway, just catching up on <br/>\nposts and had to add to this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had a doll like this many moons ago and she too, had a floppy, not too <br/>\ndetermined to stay-on arm.  I found this doll during my parents&#39; move last year.  <br/>\nI went to a thrift store (luckily the first one had what I needed for about <br/>\n$1.50), I got a doll with a similar shape and size and popped her arm off and <br/>\nreplaced the old one, it works like new now and very close to the same color and <br/>\namazingly the hand mold is a very close match.  I guess the notch and the <br/>\npiece that goes into the socket fit more tightly cuz it&#39;s not as worn out and now <br/>\nshe/he (over the years it was both) can be hugged tightly again :0).<br/>\n<br/>\nPamela<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":159464467,"authorName":"Kathy","from":"&quot;Kathy&quot; &lt;KathysTMPJ@...&gt;","profile":"kathysjtmp","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: anatomically correct baby dolls","postDate":"1082228208","msgId":92785,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM1cnVsZytlM2NsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwOGQwMWM0MjQ5YiRhMWIxNTIyMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":92766,"nextInTopic":92788,"prevInTime":92784,"nextInTime":92786,"topicId":92751,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We, too, have a hideous looking doll (passed down a generation) named Sally that my boys love.
