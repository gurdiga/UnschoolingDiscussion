I just figured if he was<br/>\ninterested that week, he could help with &quot;his&quot; chores (trash,<br/>\nroom...)and earn some money, or not do it at all and not earn the money.<br/>\nI had never been very consistent with it. As a child I never had chores<br/>\nand never had an allowance, so I figured it would be neat to try. He<br/>\nhasn&#39;t been very interested in it at all, so maybe we can let it go. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want my son to be prepared for the world by torturing him<br/>\neither. And, his room and play area gets very messy before I ask him to<br/>\nhelp clean it up. I usually only ask when I am cleaning the floors and<br/>\nneed the space empty! <br/>\n<br/>\nI do appreciate the fact that the list challenges my comfort zones.
