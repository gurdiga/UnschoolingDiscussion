That&#39;s what I find so irresistible about learning <br/>\nthis way and why I felt wrong doing it differently with my kids <br/>\n(when this is precisely how I learn and enjoy it so much).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis weekend I did more &quot;reading stuff&quot; with my 6 yog than we <br/>\nhave done all fall just because she initiated it. And I suddenly <br/>\nsaw how much she was getting out of it even though she really <br/>\nisn&#39;t reading at all yet. All this on a weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout chores and stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have routines in place that my husband I decided not to <br/>\ndisrupt. No complaints here. But I have backed off of requiring <br/>\nhelp outside those routines.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night while my daughter (whose phone time used to be <br/>\nheavily restricted) was on the phone, I walked into the kitchen to <br/>\nsee her standing on a chair peeling wallpaper for me without <br/>\nbeing asked to do it. It struck me--here she was finally getting to <br/>\nchat to her heart&#39;s content and she suddenly of her own volition <br/>\ndecided to pitch in with the wallpaper project.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoments like that are worth it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Alicia.
