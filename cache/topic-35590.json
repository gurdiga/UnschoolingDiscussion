So part of this<br/>\n&gt; equation, and undoubtedly the most important one, is the issue of trust<br/>\n&gt; between parent and child.<br/>\n&gt; If the child knows that you trust them and they can trust you not to push<br/>\n&gt; something they don&#39;t want, they will be MUCH more willing to try.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other part of this equation is something that Sandra has dubbed<br/>\n&gt; &quot;strewing&quot;. I love the picture of a parent liberally strewing a path<br/>\n </span></blockquote>before a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; child, rather than following along behind prodding and poking.<br/>\n&gt; What does strewing consist of in this house?<br/>\n&gt; Here are a few ideas......If one of my children chooses not to check<br/>\n </span></blockquote>anything<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; out at the library, I might just grab (without saying anything) a few<br/>\n </span></blockquote>books,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; cassettes or movies I think they&#39;d like....or maybe just ones that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>interest<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ME.

The bathroom is ideal, as people are<br/>\n&gt; sometimes &quot;hanging out&#39; in there for a while. LOL<br/>\n&gt; Strewing can be casual, inviting. That&#39;s what you&#39;re doing...inviting.

I<br/>\n&gt; also give them the paper and ask them to tell me if anything catches their<br/>\n&gt; eye.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think part of the key for me, is to offer the information in a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>respectful<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; method...just as I would to dh. &quot;Hey, this sounds really cool, why don&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>we<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; go try this&quot; is a lot more inviting than &quot;you should really try this<br/>\n </span></blockquote>class, I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; think you&#39;d learn a lot&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Although the wording is a very individual thing, I think the idea is to<br/>\n&gt; offer, but respect a &quot;NO&quot;.....or a &quot;maybe&quot; as much as a &quot;yes&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another part of this equation in my opinion is the level of interest for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; parent.<br/>\n&gt; If you get excited about something, it is very likely to spill over to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>other<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; individuals in the house....just as their excitement hopefully gets you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>going.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you have varied interests that you&#39;re willing to explore, this really<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sets<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the tone for the children.<br/>\n&gt; Show them the wide world of opportunities, offer up many options, but be<br/>\n&gt; respectful of them as individuals.
