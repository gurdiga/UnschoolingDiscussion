Now he can watch it and enjoy it<br/>\nwithout it &#39;taking over&#39; his daily life.  It wasn&#39;t a good thing to watch if<br/>\nhe couldn&#39;t determine what was real and what was not.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why all parents should really study child development!! To understand these types of behaviors. A child that is very young can NOT possibly make a clear distinction between reality and imaginary. It&#39;s ok, really.<br/>\nIt&#39;s part of their development to slowly start seeing the difference and nothing you ban or do or say is going to speed that process up. In fact, it&#39;s very HEALTHY and should be encouraged, not prohibited.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.&quot;<br/>\nAlbert Einstein</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89432,"nextTopicId":89500}}
