It&#39;s nice to show off a little. *sheepish grin* The<br/>\npond and climber have really become our favorite spot to hang out. We have<br/>\nlots of bonding time--I can&#39;t say enough about it. I think it adds so much<br/>\nto our unschooling lives because we enjoy being together there. It&#39;s just a<br/>\nreally special place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI uploaded some photos to the bottom of my projects page:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://danielleconger.com/Homeschool/projects.html\">http://danielleconger.com/Homeschool/projects.html</a>  while I was putting some<br/>\nother photos up. There are several there which should give you some idea of<br/>\nthe process and magnitude of the project. Certifiable would be a good<br/>\ndescription! *g*<br/>\n<br/>\nPriscilla--basically I spent a lot of time finding photos of things I like<br/>\non the internet. I bought the book _Creating Water Gardens_ by Ortho and<br/>\nborrowed several others from the library. I think the most important thing<br/>\nis to just look at loads of photos so you know exactly what look you want.<br/>\nThere are preformed ponds you can buy at Lowe&#39;s, for instance, but for a<br/>\npond the size of mine, you have to buy a special rubber liner--basically<br/>\nroofing rubber but made non-toxic for fish and wildlife. Feel free to email<br/>\nme off list if you have any specific questions about the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":166215589,"authorName":"Mattamandab@aol.com","from":"Mattamandab@...","profile":"amandabokus","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Danielle&#39;s pond","postDate":"1085510641","msgId":94701,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExYi4zMjY4NzliZC4yZGU0ZWRmMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":94706,"prevInTime":94700,"nextInTime":94702,"topicId":94701,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Danielle, I checked out your website and the pond, looks good, looking forward to seeing the photos of the whole thing.
