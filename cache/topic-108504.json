Ds <br/>\nhas kinda long shocking white blond hair,  people walk up to him randomly all <br/>\nthe time to comment about his hair  (usually positive and usually to him, not <br/>\nme..he just turned 5 so that&#39;s  kinda impressive).  Anyway, we&#39;re standing <br/>\namidst a group of ladies  and a random woman walks up to my ds and says &quot;boy, <br/>\nlooks like you need a  haircut.&quot;  He just looks at her so I respond <br/>\nwith&quot;noooo, I don&#39;t  think so.&quot;  One of the other ladies totally unrelated <br/>\nsays &quot;oh  no!  Don&#39;t you cut that gorgeous hair!&quot;  THEN, the original  <br/>\ncommenter turns to her and says, serious, and seriously rude, &quot;I don&#39;t  think <br/>\nanybody asked you to be part of this conversation!&quot;  Talk about  oblivious.<br/>\n<br/>\nA&gt;&gt;<br/>\n****************<br/>\nMy little guy is 17 months and people have made comments. His hair is also  <br/>\nvery blonde/white. <br/>\nYou know some people will always have something to say. My daughter as a  <br/>\nbaby had black hair at birth and then quickly began to turn blonde. I actually  <br/>\nhad people ask me if I bleached her hair and some didn&#39;t ask they just muttered <br/>\n under their breath.<br/>\nKids are beautiful and should all be spoken to nicely and loved. <br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108496,"nextTopicId":108486}}
