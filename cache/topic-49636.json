You don&#39;t have to have these things to do what needs to be done, and your son won&#39;t either. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou sometimes spend a day or two working on one thing mostly, don&#39;t you? A craft, reading, or a hobby. Your son will be the same way, but it will take him longer to get used to having the freedom to do whatever he chooses, so he will likely spend weeks instead of days doing something at first. I compare it to getting a new bread machine - for a week or two, you make bread every single day, try out the new recipies, and enjoy it. Then, you put it in a cabinet, and only make bread when you really get to wanting some. TV/video games will be the same way for your son. Once he gets over that &quot;new&quot; freedom to watch/play whenever he wants, he&#39;ll get to where he only does it when he needs or wants something from it. If he chooses to keep playing games after that period, then he&#39;s getting something he needs from the games. I explained it to my DH this way - what do you most want, to control your kids or to teach them self-control and self-motivation and self-confidence? IMO, a year of letting your child just &quot;be&quot; and learn himself is worth far more than any year of learning at any school you can find. After that, things will smooth out as he learns things about himself, and the learning will never stop, for the rest of his lifetime. Unlike the school mentality that learning stops after the age of 18, or 22. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n  From: the Van Rijn family <br/>\n  Yes, but what *is* &quot;decompression&quot; and how would I know if/when he&#39;s &quot;over&quot;<br/>\n  it?

Honest. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what we do. Taking into account, of course, the needs of the other<br/>\nfamily members, but that&#39;s not generally much of a problem for us, and<br/>\nhow much Rain watches TV or plays computer games is only a problem for me<br/>\nif I want to use the computer or watch a different show... and we work<br/>\nthat out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the beginning, while they&#39;re decompressing, it seems that kids often<br/>\ndo whatever they did to try to relax when they were in school for lots<br/>\nand lots of hours... it almost seems like they&#39;re making up for all the<br/>\ntime they needed it and couldn&#39;t do it. I have a friend who is 15 and<br/>\nstarted unschooling at 13, and she&#39;s just recently started to spend time<br/>\nexploring some old and new passions (photography, beading). Before that<br/>\nshe chatted on email a lot, and had that sort of antsy-unhappy feeling,<br/>\nlike she wanted to do something but didn&#39;t know what she was supposed to<br/>\ndo, and it made her nervous.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, Rain performed in a community thetater production of Carousel and<br/>\na homeschool group play about the Gold Rush. She was so tired afterwards<br/>\n(we&#39;ve been getting home after 1 every morning for a week because of<br/>\nCarousel) that she fell asleep in the car and then slept for a couple<br/>\nmore hours in my bed. Then she woke up and watched the end of The<br/>\nPractice with me, and now she&#39;s listening to a Jim Weiss tape of King<br/>\nArthur while she fixes the playmobil setup that her cat knocked over this<br/>\nmorning. She also spend quite a while snuggling with me and petting our<br/>\nnew dog (who seems to be getting more comfortable with us, and appeared<br/>\nto be glad we decided to spend an evening at home for a change).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not been a typical day, but then I don&#39;t think we actually have any<br/>\ntypical days. She did absolutely no reading, writing, or math, as far as<br/>\nI know (except for things like counting beats in the music for the dance<br/>\nshe did, and I think she played some card game in the dressing room with<br/>\na couple of other girls). <br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129426794,"authorName":"the Van Rijn family","from":"&quot;the Van Rijn family&quot; &lt;vanrijns@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"12 yo &quot;decompression&quot;??","postDate":"1036995790","msgId":49636,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDMwMWMyODk0YSRjZWMwNzVlMCRhOGRkZjEwY0BhdHRiaS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGIyLjE0ZDQzNWEyLjJiMDAyNGVjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":49637,"prevInTime":49635,"nextInTime":49637,"topicId":49636,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... deschooling?] ...
