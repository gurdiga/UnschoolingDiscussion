I think it&#39;s in June.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you e-mail me, I&#39;ll send you the info as soon as I have it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe important thing to remember about unschooling math is that it&#39;s <br/>\nnot doing nothing.  Sometimes it&#39;s thinking out loud, talking out <br/>\nloud, figuring out answsers yourself out loud.  It&#39;s conversations <br/>\nabout patterns, numbers.  It&#39;s doing puzzles, computer games, <br/>\nblocks.  It&#39;s weighing produce at the grocery store and calculating <br/>\nthe cost.  It&#39;s saving for something you love, figuring tax, also.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll always remember when my son came to me and told me he had thirty-<br/>\nsome dollars and some cents.  I went into his room and looked at his <br/>\nbed...he had piles of coins all over it.  I never sat down with him <br/>\nand told him the value of the coins.  He learned from using them.  He <br/>\nlearned from gumball machines (well, they&#39;re not gumballs anymore, <br/>\nand they&#39;re not a penny anymore either!)!  He learned from using.  <br/>\nFrom living.  And he poured out his bank and counted all his coins <br/>\nbecause he wanted to know if he had enough money for something he <br/>\nwanted to buy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThink of unschooling math in those terms, and compare that in your <br/>\nmind to schooling math.  Which would REALLY inspire true learning in <br/>\nyour child?  Sitting down to a worksheet with numbers?  Or real life <br/>\nsituations where the child has a need and desire to find an <br/>\nanswer...usually associated with something joyful.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Anne</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":130863178,"authorName":"Kelly","from":"Kelly &lt;apmomto4@...&gt;","profile":"apmomto4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Special needs article","postDate":"1045162435","msgId":58603,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2EwMWMyZDM5MSQ0MjZhYTg0MCQxNjAyYThjMEBTMDAyNjI5MjkyMD4=","referencesHeader":"PGIyZ3A0NCsxdTE0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58600,"nextInTopic":58606,"prevInTime":58602,"nextInTime":58604,"topicId":58600,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would be very interested in your Maryland conference?
