I&#39;m<br/>\nnot ready to use knitting needles yet. The bowling balls are working fine.&quot;<br/>\nAnd the knitters might say &quot;You know, knitting is never going to work really<br/>\nwell until you get rid of those bowling balls.&quot; And the newbie gets mad<br/>\nbecause darn it, they really, really like those bowling balls, and they&#39;re<br/>\nafraid to try knitting without them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo whatever it takes to get rid of the bowling balls.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case my analogy wasn&#39;t clear, in the life of an unschooler, the bowling<br/>\nballs are all those assumptions that most of us were taught in our schooled<br/>\nupbringing -- kids have to be taught to learn, children aren&#39;t enthusiastic<br/>\nabout learning, externally imposed structure is necessary,<br/>\nbribes/rewards/punishments work, etc. etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou cannot knit until you ditch the bowling balls. Once you trade them for<br/>\nsome knitting needles (faith in your kids ability to learn from whatever<br/>\nexperiences they choose), the patterns look so much easier, the yarn starts<br/>\nto flow through your fingers, and little by little you will knit!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-<br/>\n<br/>\nwho cannot even knit a square potholder, but who loves a good analogy :-)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63140,"nextTopicId":63183}}
