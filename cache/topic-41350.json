I<br/>\n&gt; know, I know, college is overrated and unnecessary in some people&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; opinion (mine included) but I have a 14 yr old son who is thinking at<br/>\n&gt; this moment that he wants to go.  I don&#39;t want him four years down the<br/>\n&gt; road unprepared because of my inability to help him plan.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What can I be doing now, in a relaxed fashion, to help him?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Suzy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ned answers: <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, he can attend college right now. Community colleges are opening up to<br/>\nhomeschoolers all across the country.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, get information from many colleges. Libraries have their catalogs;<br/>\ntalk to the librarians about those, and other ways they can help. They want<br/>\nto help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk a guidance counsellor at the high school. Sometimes they will consult<br/>\nwith you (maybe for a fee since it&#39;s outside work). It&#39;s something they do<br/>\nall day in the school and are familiar with the process of getting into<br/>\ncolleges.  Caution: Don&#39;t take anything they say as true. Check everything<br/>\nout. <br/>\n<br/>\nBooks that help people to prepare for the SAT are very useful, both for<br/>\ntaking the test and for showing what colleges expect kids to know, or at<br/>\nleast know about. The tests do not seem to rely on specific knowledge so<br/>\nmuch as common sense and logic in the testing areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the best preparations for college is work -- the kind that puts kids<br/>\nin contact with lots of people and other employees. It&#39;s also good on a<br/>\nresume. Colleges want students with the independence and initiative of a<br/>\nhomeschooler combined with the skills, patience, resilience, and<br/>\nperseverance of a good employee. Employers can also provide letters of<br/>\nrecommendation for the next adventure, whatever it may be.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41347,"nextTopicId":41351}}
