Joyful living focuses on <br/>\nthe journey.<br/>\n<br/>\n Good parents have the goal of being better parents. But how do we know if <br/>\nwhat we&#39;re doing will get us where we want to go?<br/>\n<br/>\n The problem is that when we focus on the destination, it doesn&#39;t help us <br/>\ndecide which path to take. Basically it boils down to what sounds sensible and <br/>\nwhatever works to get us there.<br/>\n<br/>\n Conventional parenting, which gets accepted as good parenting, is <br/>\ndestination oriented. It&#39;s getting kids into college. It&#39;s stopping the tantrums. It&#39;s <br/>\nmaking sure kids stay away from drugs. It&#39;s about getting kids from point A to <br/>\npoint B. It&#39;s about molding kids into what we think will help them the most.<br/>\n<br/>\n If there is one thought that will help you understand unschooling and <br/>\nrespectful parenting it is this:<br/>\n The primary goal is joyful living.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll other goals are secondary.<br/>\n<br/>\n All decent parents, of course, want their children to be happy. But they <br/>\nassume that sometimes happiness needs to be sacrificed to get something better.<br/>\n<br/>\n But for unschooling, peaceful parents meeting any goal must also meet the <br/>\ngoal of living life more joyfully.<br/>\n<br/>\n If meeting a goal means sacrificing joy, then find a better way to meet the <br/>\ngoal.<br/>\n<br/>\n It&#39;s simple to write, but not so simple to put it into practice! Our heads <br/>\nare full of &quot;have tos.&quot; We&#39;re full of fears of what will happen if we don&#39;t do <br/>\nwhat we &quot;have to.&quot; Getting rid of those &quot;have tos&quot; and fears is hard to do!<br/>\n<br/>\n     •      The first step is finding something that&#39;s better than what you <br/>\nhave.<br/>\n<br/>\n     •      The second step is wanting to change.<br/>\n<br/>\n     •      The third step is figuring out how to change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n So, as you read along, you may wonder why I suggest that parents basically <br/>\nmake life more difficult for themselves. The reason is because I believe it <br/>\nleads to a much better place. And that better place is a more joyful life for our <br/>\nchildren and our families.<br/>\n<br/>\n Joyce Fetteroll<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122519133,"authorName":"Faith Pickell","from":"Faith Pickell &lt;panda@...&gt;","profile":"ronkeelog","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] need help dealing with angry teenager!!!","postDate":"1126466814","msgId":108196,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzMjQ4NEZFLjcwODA3MDRAeGlvbmljLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxOC44ZGRlMzBkLjMwNTVjYmMwQGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIxOC44ZGRlMzBkLjMwNTVjYmMwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":108195,"nextInTopic":108200,"prevInTime":108195,"nextInTime":108197,"topicId":108159,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ****Oh God no!

I thought that unschoolers <br/>\nbelieved  their children can make their own choices when it comes to <br/>\nlearning, eating, sleeping, playing etc.  so they may listen to what <br/>\ntheir bodies are telling them.  So my thought has been that if he is <br/>\nhungry then he would listen to his body and  get some food for himself.  <br/>\nMy baby comes to me when she wants to nurse, and my little boys go get <br/>\ntheir own snack or ask me to get them some food when they are hungry.  <br/>\nI&#39;m wondering if him playing his game (which he obviously is very <br/>\ninvolved in) for long stretches and not eating is keeping him from <br/>\nlistening to his body.  By me bringing him food, doesn&#39;t that show that <br/>\nI don&#39;t trust him to take care of himself?  Hmmm...a little lightbulb <br/>\nwent off as I wrote that....I think I realized what you are trying to <br/>\nsay.  That I should &quot;strew&quot; food the same way I &quot;strew&quot; items for <br/>\npossible learning.  Is that right? <br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nI tend to get easily consumed by things. &lt;g&gt; Pretty much anything I do can easily take over *everything*! <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m 45 years old. I know better---certainly. But while I&#39;m making name badges, I&#39;ll sit at this computer for HOURS typing and correcting and printing and filing. Ben will come home and ask whether I&#39;ve eaten at all today. After getting mad that he even bothers to walk in and ASK.... &lt;G&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\nI remodelled and old house. HOURS stripping woodwork. I&#39;d start at 8:00 am and work until late at night. I&#39;d quit long enough to fix supper and clean up, but then be right back to stripping or sanding wood. At midnight, Ben would walk downstairs and remind me what time it was. I&#39;d say that I would just do *this last little bit* until he&#39;d come back down at 2:00 am and remind me that I&#39;d already done *just that little bit* and it was time for bed.<br/>\n <br/>\nSometimes I schedule several dogs to be groomed one after the other. I may be out in the groom room for *hours*---no food, no rest. I just do it until it&#39;s done---kind of my Modus Operandi! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s not uncommon for me to get huge hunger head-aches, get ultra grouchy, and yet get a LOT done.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo I know EXACTLY where your son&#39;s coming from. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nBut now *I* know better. (My older son (17) saw me at the computer just now and offered to go get me a burger---&#39;cause he knows how I am!)<br/>\n <br/>\nI happily accept food when Ben or one of the boys offers. I will take a break to swim or jump on the trampoline or walk around the block with a dog.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut I&#39;m *45*!!! ....and I&#39;ve been on these lists for years now! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI take monkey platters to Duncan (9) and his friends all the time. He&#39;s learning to ask for them now---when or *before* he needs them. THAT&#39;s what you&#39;ll see if you take care of him now. He&#39;ll learn that he&#39;ll feel better, think more clearly, and play/work better/harder when he&#39;s fueled. But he can&#39;t do that alone (in *MY* exerience, anyway!). Not all of a sudden. Not when he&#39;s consumed by what he&#39;s doing.<br/>\n <br/>\nYes, we eat when we&#39;re hungry. But we don&#39;t always think that food is necessarily *what* we need when are struggling to get to another level (of whatever). Sometimes we need a reminder---or even better: a GIFT. <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd the more you can give, the more he&#39;ll make the connections.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\nOctober 6-9, 2005<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] need help dealing with angry teenager!!!","postDate":"1126461888","msgId":108194,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIxOC44ZGRlMzBkLjMwNTVjYmMwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":108193,"nextInTopic":108195,"prevInTime":108193,"nextInTime":108195,"topicId":108159,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Please bear with me.  I thought that unschoolers <br/>\nbelieved  their children can make their own choices when it comes to <br/>\nlearning, eating, sleeping, playing etc.  so they may listen to what <br/>\ntheir bodies are telling them.  So my thought has been that if he is <br/>\nhungry then he would listen to his body and  get some food for himself.  <br/>\nMy baby comes to me when she wants to nurse, and my little boys go get <br/>\ntheir own snack or ask me to get them some food when they are hungry.  <br/>\nI&#39;m wondering if him playing his game (which he obviously is very <br/>\ninvolved in) for long stretches and not eating is keeping him from <br/>\nlistening to his body.  By me bringing him food, doesn&#39;t that show that <br/>\nI don&#39;t trust him to take care of himself?  Hmmm...a little lightbulb <br/>\nwent off as I wrote that....I think I realized what you are trying to <br/>\nsay.  That I should &quot;strew&quot; food the same way I &quot;strew&quot; items for <br/>\npossible learning.  Is that right?  I don&#39;t normally have a big problem <br/>\nwith wasting food,  but my DH has been out of work for 5 months and we <br/>\nbarely scrape by. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-=-  Would I like a better<br/>\n&gt;relationship?

And actually, he can get on the internet whenever he wants <br/>\nwith the main family computer.  He has his own password to get in and he <br/>\ncould easily do what he wants especially since he is up most of the <br/>\nnight by himself.  So, I guess I have let go of it.  My DH is looking <br/>\ninto putting internet in his room.  Hmmm, then he&#39;ll never have any <br/>\nreason to come out of his room, except to get his cat, and take the <br/>\noccasional shower, especially if I&#39;m bringing him food.

My son (will be 9 yo in late Oct)is <br/>\nREALLY into online RPGs (City of Heroes and Everquest being his <br/>\ncurrent favorites, and something called Second Life)...he almost <br/>\nnever takes time out to eat on his own, unless he is just really <br/>\nbored with the game. I am always bringing him something to eat, i <br/>\ndont always ask what he wants. In fact, its the easiest way to get <br/>\nthings like fruit and cut up veggies into him....some grapes, <br/>\nolives, carrots with ranch dressing, and apples with sugar (or <br/>\nsplenda)and cinnamon, all spread out on a plate to be munched on as <br/>\nhe wants...it always all disappears eventually. Bottles of water <br/>\ntoo. If i was really busy....lets say, i dunno working on some <br/>\nimportant project, or painting the house, or doing taxes or <br/>\nsomething...i might not want to stop and make a sandwhich, and would <br/>\nreally appreciate someone making something tasty and easy to eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet if you start bringing him finger food to eat he will be nicer. <br/>\nHungry people tend to be grumpy, and it will help i bet to keep his <br/>\nblood sugar level steady. Roll up cream cheese in turkey lunchmeat, <br/>\nor make peanut butter and jelly sandwhich squares and serve with <br/>\nmilk. Maybe a burrito. Whatever you know he likes, just make it <br/>\nsomething he can pick up easily and put down, and preferably <br/>\nsomething that can be eaten if it gets cold from sitting. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ***He can take the small tv to his room and play, but he doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;have an  internet connection to play Xbox live which is what he <br/>\n&gt;prefers to play.   So he has to play on the tv in the main family <br/>\n&gt;room where the rest of us  are in earshot to hear everything. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If there is ANY way to get an internet connection in his room, <br/>\nplease try it. I am not sure why that hasnt happened, whether its <br/>\nmoney or there not being a hookup ability or whatever. But i really <br/>\nreally think that if he can make his room his game space, and has a <br/>\nloving mom checking in, bringing yummy food, it will help. It might <br/>\nnot solve all the problems, but its a place to start for sure. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ***We don&#39;t go in and yell at him, we just ask him to quiet down.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t want to judge, because i&#39;ve popped in and said &quot;quiet down&quot; <br/>\ntoo...but if you look at it from his perspective it might seem like, <br/>\nhe is in a really tough part of the game, something dire just <br/>\nhappened, he is expressing very real frustration, anger, etc, and <br/>\nmom (who doesnt come in to bring him refreshments)comes in <br/>\nwith &quot;quiet down&quot; not &quot;man, what happened? you lost your XYZ <br/>\nweapon?! Bummer!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens when you just go watch him play for a few minutes or <br/>\nask him questions about the game (not when he is super busy in the <br/>\ngame)?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ***Oh, I know I can&#39;t make him be calm and we don&#39;t try to. But <br/>\n&gt;when his  actions are causing stress to the rest of the family <br/>\n&gt;because we are  having to listen to his yelling over and over then <br/>\n&gt;we do ask him to take  a break.  There isn&#39;t much I can do if he <br/>\n&gt;gets resentful.  I&#39;m not going  to make the rest of us suffer.  <br/>\n&gt;After a few hours of hearing it, it gets  old.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you might want to look for some creative solutions that will <br/>\nmeet both his needs and the needs of the family. I take care of my <br/>\nmom part of the week at her house (she&#39;s disabled), and my son will <br/>\nspend hours in the back bedroom on his computer playing RPGs (online <br/>\nrole playing games for those that dont know)...he is a pretty <br/>\nactive/hyper kid, and when he is in the back bedroom we can <br/>\n*constantly* hear him kicking his feet, moving the chair, <br/>\nbangbangbang...it would drive me crazy. I would constantly yell from <br/>\nthe other room &quot;stooooooop kicking!!!!&quot; he would say &quot;ok sorry&quot; and <br/>\nthen start again a minute later (because he can&#39;t help it). I <br/>\nfinally decided it was stupid to get frustrated over something that <br/>\nwasnt going to change. So i got some tennis balls, cut a hole in <br/>\nthem, and put the chair feet into them (its a wooden dining chair)--<br/>\na trick that i saw when seamus spent 2.5 days in school this year, <br/>\nthats how they kept the desks from wobbling)...i didnt have to worry <br/>\nabout the wood chair hurting the hardwood floor from all his moving <br/>\nabout, and it REALLY muffled the sound. I also gave him a big pillow <br/>\nto put at his feet under the desk, so he could &quot;bounce&quot; but more <br/>\nquietly. I&#39;m thinking about getting some walkie talkies so i can <br/>\nquietly say &quot;hey can you sing more quietly&quot; or whatever, rather than <br/>\nhaving to yell, or get frustrated from getting up twenty times to <br/>\nask that he be quiet. <br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] need help dealing with angry teenager!!!","postDate":"1126392376","msgId":108179,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5Yi4zYmVmYTA5OS4zMDU0YmMzOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":108178,"nextInTopic":108180,"prevInTime":108178,"nextInTime":108180,"topicId":108159,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We&#39;ve been <br/>\nunschooling a few months and slowly let it become of way of life as well-as in <br/>\nno chores, bedtime, game restrictions etc.    I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s hormones or if <br/>\nit&#39;s because he is free to do what he wants now, but he is becoming <br/>\nunbearable to live with.  For example, we only have one TV that has internet  <br/>\nconnection for him to play his Xbox live, which he is usually playing from the <br/>\ntime he wakes up until the time he goes to bed.  He has taken to yelling at the <br/>\ntv or other players when things aren&#39;t going right A LOT  and I will ask him <br/>\nnicely to please quiet down and he will usually yell back at me &quot;Mom, just <br/>\nstop!&quot; (as in stop talking).   If we go in there and try to ask him a question or <br/>\ntalk to him, he gets mad and yells at us.  We do try not to interrupt his game, <br/>\nbut it isn&#39;t always possible.  We can&#39;t even go into the room to get something <br/>\noff the shelf without him getting mad, and we aren&#39;t even walking in front of <br/>\nhim.  There have been a few times that I&#39;ve asked him to get off the game <br/>\nbecause I can&#39;t stand listening to him yell any longer.  Plus, I don&#39;t want his <br/>\nlittle brothers and sister to hear or see him act that way either. He&#39;s been <br/>\nhitting his little brothers too.   I can&#39;t seem to get through to him that he isn&#39;t <br/>\nbeing respectful to the rest of the family.  I&#39;m trying to be very patient with him, <br/>\nbut I don&#39;t think my patience is going to hold out long.  He just has an &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>\ncare attitude&quot;.  Obviously I can&#39;t make him be nice or not do things, but I also <br/>\ndon&#39;t think the rest of the family has to put up with this behavior.  Has anyone <br/>\nelse had this problem and have any success with dealing with this?  I need all <br/>\nthe help I can get.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nFaith</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108364,"nextTopicId":108173}}
