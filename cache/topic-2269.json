But <br/>\nthat&#39;s what&#39;s great about America!   And old-fashioned may work great for <br/>\nyou.  I hope it does.  This decade in this house, it is working for us.  I&#39;m <br/>\nat home; hubby works.  But 10-20 years ago -- our lives were different.  At <br/>\ndifferent times in the future I may do different things.  Other people have <br/>\nother choices to make.  All are valid for that person.  Assuming they are <br/>\ntrying to do their best, learning and changing as needed,   saying there is <br/>\nonly one way to structure a family is as bad as saying there is only one way <br/>\nto hs.
