During his counseling career, he <br/>\nfound that saying loving words or performing certain activities made <br/>\nthe recipient of those (for example, a spouse) feel loved.  He termed <br/>\nit filling their love tank.  He went on to describe five categories <br/>\nof words or actions, the five love languages.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe found that each person&#39;s love tank is filled more quickly by a <br/>\ncertain language.  A person tends to use that love language when <br/>\ncommunicating to another, but that other person may have a completely <br/>\ndifferent love language.  Chapman recommends finding out the other&#39;s <br/>\nlove language and using it to communicate with them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe mentions that this works well for communicating love to children <br/>\nalso, although children under 5 or 6 seem have their love tanks <br/>\nfilled quickly in any language.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56302,"nextTopicId":56307}}
