In New <br/>\nZealand the ordinary person does not own a gun.  Only those who hunt <br/>\nor belong to a gun club have guns - and the person has to be <br/>\nlicensed. So I have been brought up without guns any way.  I have <br/>\nnever had a gun in the house, even as a child. A friend did have a <br/>\ngun. I was at his home one day when he was showing dh it.  It was not <br/>\nloaded and I new this - but it scared me to death.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK so I do get your point re. toys and cars etc - infact I guess we <br/>\nare at more risk just crossing the road..........<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I still dont like guns<br/>\nMarianne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16221,"nextTopicId":16226}}
