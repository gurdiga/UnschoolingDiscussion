You pointed out alot for me to consider.  As for<br/>\nthe email address, when I set it up four years ago, I wanted something that<br/>\nreflected how I wanted to homeschool.  I wanted to follow my daughter&#39;s lead<br/>\n  I wasn&#39;t really thinking about educating as school-at-home.  But I can see<br/>\nhow it looks that way.  Thank you for reminding me that there is no high<br/>\nschool in unschooling.  As I stated, I still have moments of panic!   I am<br/>\namazed at what my girls are learning without me leaning over them,<br/>\nprescribing every thought.  They are getting more comfortable with it as I<br/>\ngrow more comfortable.  Again, I thank you.\r<br/>\nPeace,\r<br/>\nSarah\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76106,"nextTopicId":76120}}
