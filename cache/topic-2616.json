Have faith.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom an interesting perspective, I am reading my Unschooling messages just<br/>\nnow (and over the past week) intermixed with a pretty hot discussion that<br/>\nis taking place on another list that I am on (an adoption list.)  There are<br/>\nsome folks who homeschool there (even 1 unschooler) some PS teachers,<br/>\nsocial workers, families with kids in private school, families with kids in<br/>\nPS, and many have varying degrees of faith and/or satisfaction in the<br/>\nsystem(s) they use or have used.  I have included some excerpts below, as I<br/>\nthought it might be interesting to add to our discussion here.  I also<br/>\nwanted to hear some feedback on this conversation from a more like minded<br/>\nforum.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is one mother who homeschools so that her children will not learn<br/>\nabout evolution (!) and will be &quot;sheltered and protected.&quot;  Is there anyone<br/>\nhere who thinks that way?  I am afraid that her posts are perpetuating<br/>\nstereotypes about homeschooling...<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the Unschoolers there who are not us:<br/>\n&quot;&lt;&lt; but they&#39;re still public schools, expecting all<br/>\nkids to fit into the same sized/shaped hole, teaching to &quot;the<br/>\nmiddle of the class&quot; so that the kids that are not as quick wind<br/>\nup feeling dumb, and the very bright kids wind up learning how to<br/>\nget good grades, rather than learning how to learn. &gt;&gt;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a list member who is a PS teacher:<br/>\n&quot;I just don&#39;t see this where I am. I teach in a wonderful district that has<br/>\nsome wonderful teacher who are very dedicated to reaching ALL students. I am<br/>\namazed at the hours they put into going to inservices to stretch themselves<br/>\nto be better. In one week I have assessed all the students to know where they<br/>\nare so when I call them back to read with me we can work on the skills that<br/>\nthey need. I see the low making great growth as well as the high. I have<br/>\nnever had trouble challenging the high and helping the low at the same time.<br/>\nI know that there are many teachers with many styles but I haven&#39;t seen the<br/>\ntype of class where the teacher teaches to the middle for a long time. When<br/>\nwas the last time you went and observed at your local school? You might be<br/>\nsurprised at the improvement and change over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I am seeing students in 2-3rd grade having great book talks about their<br/>\nfavorite authors. I am seeing them write creative stories and help each other<br/>\nimprove and edit their stories. I am watching my 2nd graders working as a<br/>\nclose group to solve problems and make our room a safe fun place. I hear them<br/>\nlearning to give compliments and solve the play ground problems and think I<br/>\ncould never reach them the way they reach each other. None of these type of<br/>\ninteractions could be done in a home school situations where they aren&#39;t<br/>\nworking with others their age. I know there are probably some positive<br/>\naspects to homeschooling, but there are also many things these kids miss out<br/>\non.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the same homeschool parent as the first one, above:<br/>\n&quot;This has been addressed a few times already on this list, so<br/>\nplease forgive me for being repetitive.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooled kids don&#39;t *have* to miss out on anything. There are<br/>\nhomeschool groups that are quite large, I already mentioned the<br/>\none in my neighborhood with over 200 families actively<br/>\nparticipating. There is a classroom full of kids of every age,<br/>\nand that&#39;s just in my neck of the woods. They have facilities<br/>\nwhere they do arts and crafts in a group situation once a week,<br/>\nthere&#39;s field trips (which many school districts just don&#39;t do<br/>\nanymore) and group study, also on a weekly basis. There are also<br/>\nextra-curricular activities. For the older kids, they study<br/>\ntogether for the more difficult subjects, either with a parent<br/>\nwho has volunteered to teach the subject, or with a teacher hired<br/>\nfor that purpose. One large group even has dances and other<br/>\nsocial activities for the older kids! Some districts will let<br/>\nkids participate in extra-curricular activities, for those that<br/>\ndon&#39;t, there are community leagues.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve me, I&#39;m not trying to sell anyone on my option, although<br/>\nlike anyone else, I do like to dispel the myths. If nobody here<br/>\ngave homeschooling a second thought, fine by me! But my decision<br/>\nto homeschool my son wasn&#39;t a knee-jerk reaction, it was<br/>\ncarefully thought out, something my husband and I thoroughly<br/>\ndiscussed. I had every preconceived notion about homeschooling<br/>\nthat I&#39;ve seen mentioned here, until my sister in law did it with<br/>\nmy nieces. And they succeeded beyond any expectation their<br/>\nprevious performance would have hinted at. I hate to say this,<br/>\nbut my sister in law was never a college level student, but she<br/>\ndid an excellent job, sent the girls to magnet schools once spots<br/>\nopened up testing a grade level *ahead* of their age, socially<br/>\nwell adjusted, and quite happy with the experience. I decided to<br/>\nlook into homeschooling with a less prejudiced eye (not<br/>\nsuggesting anyone else here is prejudiced, just admitting I was).<br/>\nI simply saw a chance to avoid what I saw as the pitfalls of<br/>\npublic (or even private) school education. I know it won&#39;t work<br/>\nfor everyone. I believe it will work just fine for us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a homeschooling parent:<br/>\nI am sorry, but there is absolutely nothing positive that my kids are missing<br/>\nout on in my opinion.  I am not sure how you can offer this opinion if you<br/>\nhave not homeschooled or are not intimately involved with homeschoolers.<br/>\nThe quality or racial make-up of institutionalized schooling is not the<br/>\nprimary reason we have chosen to homeschool.  For our family, it is a<br/>\nlifestyle choice.  We enjoy being together all day and functioning as a<br/>\nfamily unit.  I like learning with my kids and being there when the<br/>\nlightbulbs go off and they grasp a new concept.  We like being able to drive<br/>\nacross the country leisurely taking our classroom on the road at any time in<br/>\nthe year.  I like sleeping late or taking a whole day to browse an exhibit at<br/>\na local museum.  I love that my kids consider their siblings among their best<br/>\nfriends.  I love that my ten year old son can change a diaper with the best<br/>\nof them and adores babies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that many people who don&#39;t homeschool love all these things too and I<br/>\nknow there are plenty of extremely close families that don&#39;t homeschool.  But<br/>\nthe main reason we do homechool is because we like the lifestyle that it<br/>\naffords our family.  Even if I lived in a district with the number one public<br/>\nschool in the country or had access to the most prestigous private school in<br/>\nthe world, I would still homeschool my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom another parent:<br/>\nThis is such an interesting thread. Our children&#39;s education, plus who & what<br/>\ninfluences their socialization and value system is definitely a highly<br/>\ncharged decision for a parent. I know it always was for me. I opted to take<br/>\nthe public school route for each of my four children.<br/>\nAll of my children have come into contact with excellent and caring teachers.<br/>\nThe last 2 more so than the first 2. Throughout the girls&#39; (my last 2) school<br/>\nyears, they were blessed with projects, activities and challenges that have<br/>\nguided them into very successful young women. Writing and reading were<br/>\nemphasized, and self thinking & discovery was encouraged. My oldest daughter<br/>\nfound a teacher who became a mentor to her and gave her hours of extra help.<br/>\nGuided her toward scholarship money and funding for college. Helped her with<br/>\nessays, resumes and spent time encouraging her.  She is now in her second<br/>\nyear at a local University and continues to succeed. My last daughter is now<br/>\na senior in h.s. and very involved in her school. Both girls became involved<br/>\nin their schools (they went to different schools in the same district-their<br/>\nchoice) multicultural clubs and found a voice for their minority status--the<br/>\nschool system supported and encouraged this also. I would not have been able<br/>\nto provide several aspects of their &quot;educational&quot; experiences & activities.<br/>\nWe were either very blessed, or very fortunate<br/>\nnot to have what I have heard as described as &quot;normal&quot; teenage rebellion.<br/>\nThere has been no skipping, bad grades, bad language, abusive, disrespectful<br/>\nor irresponsible behavior or actions, uncaringness nor do they display a lack<br/>\nof motivation. As parents we set the standard, but thankfully our school<br/>\nsystem found ways to affirm and hold students to these standards also. But<br/>\nultimately it was our children&#39;s choice to create their own standards and I<br/>\nam so proud of the choices each of them has chosen to make.<br/>\nI know not all school systems are the same, nor do I believe all students<br/>\nwould benefit from public school--even a good one, but for our family it was<br/>\na good discision and isn&#39;t that our goal. I have never looked at decision,<br/>\nprivate or public school as good, bad or better than another, but more what<br/>\nis the goal and how can we best help our child to be a well rounded, caring,<br/>\nloving and productive adult. There cannot possibly be one choice fits all<br/>\nanswer to this question.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately I had already deleted some of the more (ahem) shall we<br/>\nsay...adamant? messages against homeschooling before I decided to turn to<br/>\nthis group for a little feedback regarding this discussion.  I should tell<br/>\nyou that I started the whole thing by asking why, in all their lamentations<br/>\nabout finding good quality and racially diverse schooling situations for<br/>\ntheir cross-racially adopted children, nobody ever mentioned homeschooling<br/>\nas an option.  Then I ducked and covered!  <br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2633,"nextTopicId":2541}}
