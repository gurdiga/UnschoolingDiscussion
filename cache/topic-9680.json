As for cost of living, a two bdrm house in To in<br/>\na reasonable neighbourhood, about $250,000, obviously it can go up alot<br/>\nfrom there, not down very much unless your REALLY into home renovation. As<br/>\nfor the burbs, that depends on how far you want to drive, One hour drive<br/>\nwhich is very suburban, varies alot.  Ie. New subcivisions ar aften around<br/>\n200,000, but very crowded, if you are willing top drive a bit further and<br/>\nlive more in the country less.  Depends which direction you drive.  Maybe<br/>\nI&#39;ll see you on the Toronto Homeschool list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve unsubscribed, not because this wasn&#39;t fascinating, just too much<br/>\nvolume at this stage of my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck Holly finding work.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8906,"nextTopicId":9606}}
