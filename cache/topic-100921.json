She has plenty of social <br/>\ninteraction afternoon hours when she&#39;s in her perf. arts programs, <br/>\nhanging out with kids after school hours, but would like to connect <br/>\nwith some at home peers.  We get involved with some homeschool <br/>\ngroups activities, but since we are unschoolers, it&#39;s hard for my dd <br/>\nto connect with other kids that are often SO regimented...she feels <br/>\nvery guarded when she discusses things like music, movies.  In many <br/>\nways, she&#39;s found that she can relate to her public school peers <br/>\nbetter socially...does this make sense at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nMind you, we don&#39;t have a lot of unschoolers in our area.  And over <br/>\nthe course of time, we&#39;ve come to question whether <br/>\nsome &quot;unschoolers&quot; really were unschooling when you find out that <br/>\nthey use book lists, curriculum, etc. and seem to really &quot;guide&quot; <br/>\ntheir childrens&#39; interests and activities.  And I&#39;m sure that some <br/>\nof them see our &quot;liberal&quot; lifestyle as a possible &quot;bad influence&quot;.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s kind of funny, because when my daughters walk in the room, a <br/>\nbunch of the kids get really excited and light up (they&#39;re fun to be <br/>\naround!)...but then you see them get really guarded again around the <br/>\nparents.  The girls notice it, too and have kind of pointed it out <br/>\nto me (like why do the kids act different around their moms?).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk a lot about how you can&#39;t look to just one &quot;group&quot; of people <br/>\nto meet your needs socially, that you&#39;ll have friends, etc. that <br/>\nyou&#39;ll connect with in all walks of life.  And my daughter does, in <br/>\nfact, have quite an interesting assortment, especially the perf. <br/>\narts crowd :)!  But understandably she would still like to make some <br/>\nconnections with other kids at home, even just to communicate on-<br/>\nline.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know of any safe place that unschooling kids can chat?  <br/>\nIs there a Yahoo group, pen-pal system, etc.? My dd has a lot of <br/>\npenpals, but is starting to get frustrated with one line responses, <br/>\nwould love to have a good &quot;e-conversation&quot; with someone else, <br/>\nsimilar to what we all do here!  In fact, she said to me tonight <br/>\nthat it wasn&#39;t fair that there were so many places I could go for <br/>\nunschooling support and no place for her!  She&#39;s got a point...<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if I seemed to be all over the place here, trying to play SIMS <br/>\nwith the dd and type at the same time is quite challenging!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nCyndi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100923,"nextTopicId":100948}}
