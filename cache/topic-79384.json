Anna <br/>\nis not a really outgoing,  &quot;conversation initiating&quot; person.  But, she LOVES <br/>\nbabies, and once she feels comfortable with thier parents, she opens up and <br/>\nreally connects with the kids.   She got her first jobs just by going to play <br/>\ngroup with us, she being the oldest kid there.   She would just play with the <br/>\nlittle kids,  that is how she got her first job as a Mommy&#39;s helper.   She then <br/>\ngot a job watching some of the kids during a bible study on Thursday nights.   <br/>\nAs folks started asking her about babysitting, she made a resume to hand out. <br/>\n  Another mother from our play group asked her to babysit for her a couple of <br/>\ntimes, and that led her hiring Anna to watch the children at a 3 day training <br/>\nconference for some local La Leche League leaders.  ( it was 3 mornings, <br/>\n9-12)   Anna watched 6 kids during the meetings.  And, one of those mothers called <br/>\nher and she has sat for her twice.!   Last week, she earned almost $100 <br/>\nbabysitting.  She now has business cards and she has started making a <br/>\ncalandar/schedule to keep up with her jobs.   She had to turn someone down for Sunday <br/>\nafternoon because we are going camping.   She started volunteering at a local <br/>\npreschool this week, and I am sure this will lead to more baby sitting jobs.   <br/>\n<br/>\n Anna has such a love for children, and a deep understanding and wisdom about <br/>\nwhat they need how to interact with them.   She feels more comfortable when <br/>\nit&#39;s just her and the kids,  I think she feels somewhat inhibited when thier <br/>\nparents are hovering, like they are holding her under close scrutiny.. And, I&#39;m <br/>\nsure they are.. LOL. .After all, most mothers want to be sure and confident <br/>\nwith thier babysitter.   But, as she gets to know the children and the parents <br/>\nbetter, it is almost always a great connection for everyone.   She has watched <br/>\nsome kids that she did not like the way the parents treated the kids, and she <br/>\nwould not agree to &quot;punish&quot; them when thier parents were gone.    She felt so <br/>\nbad for the kids, but she was glad to not be called back to watch them.   She <br/>\nhas a plan ( and it could change at any time).. that she wants to continue her <br/>\nbabysitting jobs,  study early childhood probably at a community college, <br/>\nthen get Montessori Training and open her own Montessori School.    But she also <br/>\nwants to have a big family and stay at home and unschool them.    The good <br/>\nthing about it is, she can have that plan for now, and she can change it, modify <br/>\nit, drop it, or continue to pursue it.   <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Vet story, and other tales of wonder","postDate":"1062110172","msgId":79393,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCNzNGQzFDLjFEQTIyJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFlNS5mMTZiYjc1LjJjN2ZkMjY1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":79384,"nextInTopic":79412,"prevInTime":79392,"nextInTime":79394,"topicId":79384,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
