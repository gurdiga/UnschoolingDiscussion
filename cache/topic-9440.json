Our son is permanently and<br/>\nhopelessly Urchin - and IRL we have caught some grief over that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBBBBBUUUUTTTT - there is a story!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n15 or so years ago we were at a reenactment, camping with about 6<br/>\nor 7 other compatible families.  The kids were in the 5-12 age<br/>\nrange, big enough to be allowed to stay up at the campfire when<br/>\nthe adults were ready to lie down.  And we did and they did.  Our<br/>\nfamily had done the Riddle of the Sphinx in the car on the way<br/>\ndown; the kids decided to create an &quot;Ages of Kids&quot; replica.  I<br/>\nheard bits and pieces as I drifted off and got the full taxonomy<br/>\nthe next day, the features, milestones, and purposes of each age.<br/>\nThe Urch was almost 9, a &quot;chilford&quot; according to their labels.<br/>\nThe next and very desirable stage of childhood was to become an<br/>\nUrchin, starting at about age 10.  At about 10, these young<br/>\nphilosophers decided a reasonably well raised child could survive<br/>\non his own, as in become a street urchin successfully, if they so<br/>\ndesired.  He very much wanted to reach that exalted status of<br/>\nself sufficiency, without regard to how realistic the assessment<br/>\nwas.  He stuck with that desire for the next 14 months, with all<br/>\nkinds of effort into learning the ways of taking care of<br/>\nyourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he turned 10, I made him a certificate congratulating him on<br/>\nbecoming an Urchin.  He was pleased as punch, and insisted that<br/>\nwe call him Urchin.  The fact that his given name is an old<br/>\nfamily one that is not susceptible to good shortening as a<br/>\nnickname may have colored the request.  Nonetheless his nickname<br/>\nof Urchin or The Urch stands as a comfortable example of our own<br/>\nfamily reality, however at odds it may be with what a dictionary<br/>\nwould indicate the meaning would be.<br/>\n<br/>\n....none of which expresses any view on whether a particular<br/>\nnickname or label in another particular context may or may not<br/>\nreflect unstated negative opinions or unintentionally damaging<br/>\nimages.  For us, one that most would find inappropriate is in<br/>\nfact a joyous inside joke.<br/>\n<br/>\n...OK lots of tougher or more thoughtful ones to write, but the 6<br/>\nwants to search for movies based on Dahl books, beyond Willie<br/>\nWonka.  I&#39;m gonna go fiddle with the pumpernickel dough and see<br/>\nhow far she gets before she needs help.  My observation is that<br/>\nshe gets a lot further if I&#39;m not too close, more willing to make<br/>\nmistakes and go down blind alleys.

Nicknames are not labels <br/>\nunless used as such. Just because you call someone &quot;sweetie&quot; doesn&#39;t mean <br/>\nthat they are always sweet, does it? It&#39;s just a nice, friendly, nickname. <br/>\nUgh, and I said I wouldn&#39;t say anything else on this subject!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with nicknames except for the fact of <br/>\nwhat they are. We call the kids things like munchkin, punkin and meepy. <br/>\nThings that have no real meaning except sounding cute or coming to mind. Not <br/>\nhurtful in my eyes or anyone else&#39;s. Would anyone here resent being called a <br/>\npunkin? Okay wait, maybe if you are very large and wearing an orange <br/>\noutfit.....but then I wouldn&#39;t do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is, what can label and become true. I remember when my godfather <br/>\nwas dying and in a home. The guy across the hall would yell constantly, <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t make out what he was saying, just yelling. Someone made the remark <br/>\nto my godfather that it was annoying but he must be use to it. My godfather <br/>\nsaid, &quot;If you hang long enough, you get use to that too!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI always remember that for a lot of things in daily life. Think the child <br/>\nwill lie all the time and they will. Think they are losers and they will be. <br/>\nThey are labels that can ring true.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalling a kid a sweetie pie can&#39;t actually make them a sweetie pie, or a <br/>\npunkin, or a nut. It&#39;s an expression that generally pops up with no intent <br/>\nto hurt and I don&#39;t think it does. But things that can come true, even <br/>\nwithout the intent to hurt, still will. Like chubby, lazy, shy or <br/>\nhyperactive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like this post is as clear as mud as to what I wanted to say. I <br/>\nstarted out with it all nice in my head.
