The story would <br/>\nbe comical if it weren&#39;t so serious.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntimidation and ridicule are deeply ingrained in Japan&#39;s educational <br/>\nsystem, so this kind of problem should come as little surprise. Still, it <br/>\nseems amazing that the instructor supposedly never realized he had done <br/>\nanything wrong until an issue was made of the incident.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich just goes to show you that some people just don&#39;t get it -- and <br/>\nthat maybe classroom teachers *themselves* are the ones who need a little <br/>\ninstruction in what fairness, respect and rightness are all about.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian Covert<br/>\n(KnoK NEWS)<br/>\nin Osaka, Japan<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n[Mainichi Daily News - Monday, July 17, 2000]<br/>\n <br/>\nTEACHER CANED FOR QUESTIONABLE ETHICS CLASS<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Ken Okuma<br/>\nMainichi Shimbun <br/>\n<br/>\nFUKUOKA -- A public elementary school teacher who forced his third-grade <br/>\npupils to point out kids they didn&#39;t want to have in their ethics class <br/>\nhas been forced to make a shame-faced apology. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe 51-year-old teacher at the Maidashi Municipal Elementary School in <br/>\nFukuoka apologized to the third grader who was humiliated in front of his <br/>\nentire class, when two-thirds of his classmates said they didn&#39;t want to <br/>\nhave him around. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe teacher, whose name is being withheld, also apologized to the little <br/>\nboy&#39;s mother. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I never dreamed the kids would put their hands up [when I asked who they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want in the class anymore]. I treated the situation lightly, which <br/>\ncaused me to teach in an improper manner,&quot; school officials quoted the <br/>\nteacher as saying. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoard of Education officials in Fukuoka said that the incident occurred <br/>\nduring an ethics class on June 14 after the teacher had finished reading <br/>\nthe children a story. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Okay. Who, like the main character in the story we&#39;ve just read, doesn&#39;t <br/>\nneed to be in our class any longer?&quot; the teacher asked the pupils. He <br/>\nthen read through a list of the pupils in the class and ordered the <br/>\nchildren to raise their hands if there was someone they felt shouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave been studying with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf the three children pegged by their classmates, about two-thirds of the <br/>\nclass had raised their hands when one boy&#39;s name had been mentioned. <br/>\nThough the teacher then forced pupils to say something nice about the <br/>\nboy, sources say that his shock at being ostracized by his peers was <br/>\ngreat. He apparently returned to his home in tears. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter realizing what an ordeal he had put the boy through, the teacher <br/>\napparently apologized. But school officials learned what happened when <br/>\nthey received a letter of complaint from another pupil&#39;s mother. The <br/>\nteacher went and apologized to the boy&#39;s mother on June 30 once his <br/>\nmisdeed had become known. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Copyright - Mainichi Shimbun, 2000]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11262,"nextTopicId":11271}}
