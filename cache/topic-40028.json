Introduced in<br/>\nan 1802 letter to the Danbury, Connecticut Baptist Association,<br/>\nJefferson&#39;s &quot;wall&quot; is accepted by many Americans as a concise<br/>\ndescription of the U.S. Constitution&#39;s church-state arrangement<br/>\nand conceived as a virtual rule of constitutional law.<br/>\nDespite the enormous influence of the &quot;wall&quot; metaphor, almost no<br/>\nscholarship has investigated the text of the Danbury letter, the<br/>\ncontext in which it was written, or Jefferson&#39;s understanding of<br/>\nhis famous phrase. Thomas Jefferson and the Wall of Separation<br/>\nBetween Church and State offers an in-depth examination of the<br/>\norigins, controversial uses, and competing interpretations of<br/>\nthis powerful metaphor in law and public policy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the Author<br/>\nDaniel L.

Public schools do that to almost<br/>\neveryone. If<br/>\n| there&#39;s public funding for a private school whose program goes<br/>\nagainst the<br/>\n| wishes of many people, then the funding is a form of tyranny --<br/>\nstrictly<br/>\n| speaking -- because many people are forced to pay for it who<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do it<br/>\n| voluntarily.  Public schools do that to almost everyone.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Thirty years ago, I was involved with a group that wanted the<br/>\nlocal public<br/>\n| school system to fund our new, innovative private school. (This<br/>\nwas in<br/>\n| Aspen, Colorado and I was even on the city council) Our<br/>\nproposal was not<br/>\n| accepted and the families (most of whom were wealthy) had to<br/>\npay for their<br/>\n| own children&#39;s schooling all by themselves, or with private<br/>\nhelp.

Not the least of what&#39;s<br/>\nwrong with<br/>\n| it is the fact that the government will always want to control<br/>\nit, and if<br/>\n| it&#39;s a school, that means *make it like its other schools --<br/>\nrotten.*<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Ned Vare </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40022,"nextTopicId":40032}}
