I was \n  just up allll night (as in 4:30am) last<br>night with my boyfriend cuz we had \n  a deep discussion<br>about something and he was done when the \n  discussion<br>was done and I was getting soooo frustrated cuz I<br>can&#39;t just \n  do that. I there is no such thing as<br>absolute closure for me when it comes \n  to thinking and<br>worrying and a forboding feeling and that quote \n  from<br>Sandra is just what I needed. I&#39;m painting it huge and<br>hanging on \n  my wall. <br>Me and my sister are always complaining that we DON&#39;T<br>want to \n  be like other people we know that just stroll<br>along thinking everyhting \n  grand and NEVER think or be<br>concerned with anything, are just happy to \n  be<br>disillusioned with rose colored glasses, (ok,<br>sometimes we do..heeh, \n  but it is actually physically<br>impossible for us)&nbsp; but we take it to \n  the other<br>extreme and can&#39;t shut it off. <br>It&#39;s truly a problem for me, \n  moreso lately, it seems.<br>I know there was a point in my life where I \n  felt<br>content I had come pretty close to finding that<br>balance, but who \n  knows what happened. My dad was sick<br>for awhile and everyday was a worry \n  that that would be<br>the day he died and then he did die and \n  directly<br>following that was a good time for me mentally, cuz I<br>saw \n  things clearly and realized, like Sandra said that<br>you can ruin what life \n  you have right now by worrying<br>about when you&#39;ll die, but that is a hard \n  attitude to<br>keep up when you have precious kids you love and want<br>to \n  protect and it seems nowadays the amount of people<br>who were never abused in \n  any way as a child are in the<br>minority...and parents are nonethewiser, so I \n  am<br>constantly worried that I am missing something<br>important that is \n  seriously damaging my kids somehow,<br>or that I am overlooking some serious \n  health problem<br>and then one of us, or someone we love and are close<br>to \n  will die suddenly, or ...or.... or... <br>I could go on and on. K, sorry to \n  ramble on and on,<br>but it is actually really comforting to me to \n  see<br>other people who ..well...think alot. :) and don&#39;t<br>fall asleep after \n  counting three and saying the magic<br>word.

Though I don&#39;t like labels, so<br/>\n&gt; I normally just say we don&#39;t eat meat. I have a<br/>\n&gt; question for Colette (beautiful name, by the way; have<br/>\n&gt; you read Colette the writer?). What about companion<br/>\n&gt; animals, cats and dogs and so forth? Just curious<br/>\n&gt; about how you feel about that. My dd is must more of<br/>\n&gt; an animal rights activist than I&#39;d ever have the<br/>\n&gt; energy to be. At age 8, she writes letters to the<br/>\n&gt; editor about furs, she plays<br/>\n&gt; throw-the-tomato-at-the-fur-wearer at PETA&#39;s website,<br/>\n&gt; she adopts seals with her birthday money, she goes<br/>\n&gt; right up to strangers in furs and asks them if they<br/>\n&gt; know an animal was killed to make the coat, etc. And<br/>\n&gt; embarrassingly, she will see someone eating fish in a<br/>\n&gt; restaurant and say (not shout, but say in a normal<br/>\n&gt; tone of voice), &quot;I wish that fish was still alive.&quot; So<br/>\n&gt; far, she hasn&#39;t had the realization that many shoes<br/>\n&gt; are leather. I already had to give up my suede jacket<br/>\n&gt; when she made me realize what a hypocrite I was being<br/>\n&gt; to wear it. :) Soon, I&#39;m sure, the entire family will<br/>\n&gt; be wearing only non-animal shoes.  Anyway, two cats<br/>\n&gt; have us as pets/servants/royal subjects and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; wondering if I can expect dd to want to liberate them<br/>\n&gt; in the future. Because I&#39;d have to get pretty coercive<br/>\n&gt; and authoritarian about saying no way to that. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!
