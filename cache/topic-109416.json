However, there are <br/>\nsome children who truly do have dyslexia and other processing issues or <br/>\ndisabilities.  My son didn&#39;t read until he was 9 going on 10.  We had more <br/>\nfights, heated arguments and me accusing that he was being lazy and <br/>\nuncooperative.  It pains me to say this but 99.9% of the problem was that <br/>\n&quot;I&quot; was more concerned about what others thought about him not being able to <br/>\nread.  How can &quot;I&quot; possibly be doing a good job educating my children at <br/>\nhome when my almost 10 year old can&#39;t even read simple words like an and <br/>\nthe?  Well I found out after the damage was done that my son truly does have <br/>\ndyslexia, but even with this very real problem learned almost over night on <br/>\nhis own when &quot;he&quot; was truly ready.  I didn&#39;t know about letting learn on his <br/>\nown at the time I continued to push and push until our relationship was <br/>\nseriously damaged.  I am still at this point rebuilding that.  It&#39;s not easy <br/>\nto fix once it&#39;s broken.  By the way this same child, once learning on his <br/>\nown to read has read somewhere between 400-500 books in the last 1 1/2 <br/>\nyears.  With comprehension.  He can&#39;t read aloud very well, but to himself <br/>\nhe reads almost constantly. If I don&#39;t get to the library when he has <br/>\nfinished the last of his 12 books for the week he will find something around <br/>\nthe house to read.  Heck, I have even caught him reading the dictionary!  He <br/>\nstill can&#39;t write or spell very well, but I believe that will come in time <br/>\nbecause he sees and reads words all the time.  And even if he never writes, <br/>\nwell maybe that is not going to be one of the things he pursues in his life <br/>\nanyway.  My point in all of this is that you need to relax.  Enjoy reading <br/>\nto him.  Never, never ever ridicule him or compare him to his siblings or <br/>\nfriends.  He will get their in his own time.  What makes your timetable the <br/>\nright timetable anyway?  I had to ask myself the same questions.  Just love <br/>\nhim for all his unique qualities and respect the differences.  Help him to <br/>\ndo all the things he wants that require reading.  I know when my kids were <br/>\nyounger and I have 5, that when the youngest at the time wanted a drink or a <br/>\nsnack or whatever, they weren&#39;t old enough to get it themselves. The needed <br/>\nhelp.  I didn&#39;t get angry with them because they couldn&#39;t manage yet, or <br/>\nforce them to climb up on the cabinets to get a cup or whatever.  That would <br/>\nbe dangerous and unsafe.  I or one of the older siblings would help them. <br/>\nThe dangers are different obviously, but the damage is just as significant <br/>\nin the long run and even immediately.  Don&#39;t deprive him of his need and <br/>\ndesire to learn other things because you can&#39;t get past the fact that he <br/>\ncan&#39;t read yet.  It&#39;s not about the order in which they learn things it&#39;s <br/>\nhelping to foster a love of learning of all sorts of things when they are <br/>\nready.  Lose the worlds timetable, and devote yourself to loving your son. <br/>\nAnd remember the advice you sought out here may sound harsh and go against <br/>\nyour grain, but if you let it sink in and examine yourself and your motives <br/>\nyou will begin to see where the real issues lie.   My son now knows more <br/>\nstuff than I ever hope to know and I am so proud of him.  I love to tell <br/>\npeople how he learned to read late and now it doesn&#39;t bother him at all.  In <br/>\nfact I read this post to him before I sending it and he said that he hoped <br/>\nthat it helped you and your son. Help and change don&#39;t always come easy to <br/>\nthose of us who have spent years doing things differently regardless of the <br/>\nfact that we were making no real progress.  For some reason we just keep <br/>\nplodding along in the same wrong direction because the world says it is <br/>\nright so it must be right.  Right?  WRONG!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nDana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":235318765,"authorName":"janddplus5","from":"&quot;janddplus5&quot; &lt;janddplus5@...&gt;","profile":"janddplus5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 5545","postDate":"1131562520","msgId":109467,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRrdGdtbytkM2ZiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc4MzY1RkQ3LUNEMUYtNDJDMi05NDhDLThERjRBNDk4RjIyQkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":109464,"nextInTopic":109991,"prevInTime":109466,"nextInTime":109468,"topicId":109416,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... do a ... now ... a ...
