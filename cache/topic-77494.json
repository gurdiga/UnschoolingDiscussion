She described herself on another list as &lt;br&gt;&quot;a former victim of Sandra Dodd&quot; and now she&#39;s telling people she doubts I &lt;br&gt;write my own essays.  That&#39;s probably actionable stuff, and I&#39;d like to know who &lt;br&gt;she is.  Since she won&#39;t even tell this list whether she&#39;s an unschooler, I&#39;m &lt;br&gt;assuming she&#39;s someone who&#39;s been here before and came back under another name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you think anyone will believe the doubt she is trying to cast on my &lt;br&gt;integrity?  It&#39;s a shame, character assassination just for personal amusement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are the quotes about the writings:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Yes, you have the right to say what you feel, and so do we. I stated  &lt;br&gt;&gt; what I felt about the possibility of Sandra not being the true author  &lt;br&gt;&gt; and I meant it. My comments are not a personal attack, but an honest  &lt;br&gt;&gt; take on my experience with the assumed author&#39;s personality and the  &lt;br&gt;&gt; contents of the articles. It&#39;s an opinion, not an insult.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; My comments, are no different that anyone who would review an article  &lt;br&gt;&gt; or it&#39;s author. I was actually neutral on the contents and all I  &lt;br&gt;&gt; stated was that I don&#39;t feel Sandra is the actual author. I may be  &lt;br&gt;&gt; wrong or right, but I  do have the right to question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeva&lt;br&gt;pink lantern &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pinklantern@...\">pinklantern@...</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If anyone knows her real name, could you e-mail me on the side?  Accusations &lt;br&gt;that I have passed someone else&#39;s words off as my own (plagiarism) or taken &lt;br&gt;money on false pretenses (fraud) are pretty serious accusations.  Baseless, and &lt;br&gt;reckless, and they serve NO useful purpose for the accuser.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MY real name is Sandra Dodd.  I&#39;ve never hidden.  &lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve never avoided direct questions about my children or my unschooling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s pretty sad that I&#39;m being attacked by a troublemaker in a disguise.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSandra, I don&#39;t know who Jeva&#39;s is but I just wanted to say it sounds like somebody is jealous. I don&#39;t post often, I&#39;m lucky to find the time to read and post on a couple of boards, but I enjoy reading the posts when I can.
