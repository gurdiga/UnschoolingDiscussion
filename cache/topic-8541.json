We<br/>\ndon&#39;t have any native mammals in NZ at all, but we do have deer, pigs and so<br/>\non in the wild, they are usually seen as pests and/or are hunted/farmed.<br/>\nPossums are a major pest here.<br/>\n<br/>\nRats and mice aren&#39;t a particular problem usually. We do have two cats which<br/>\ndeal with any wild ones that might be around the house. We also keep two pet<br/>\nrats which have been a lot of fun. I wasn&#39;t keen at all but they&#39;ve been<br/>\nvery responsive and interesting and interactive with our girls. We have had<br/>\nguineapigs in the past but they are much more timid.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I had in mind when I posted about the lack of wildlife was the bigger<br/>\nanimals such as wolves, bears, lions etc as we had been watching so many<br/>\nvideos about these animals both in the wild and as &quot;pets&quot; or semi-tame (like<br/>\n&quot;Born Free&quot;). And I have long liked the idea of keeping turtles but here you<br/>\nbuy teeny ones from the pet shop and they are *so* expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew Zealand is a beautiful place and I certainly appreciate the lack of<br/>\n*dangerous* creatures here!<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Susan Friesen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nfriesen@...\">nfriesen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Karen@...\">Karen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nCc: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 18, 2000 2:48 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Hi Karen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi Karen, I read your comments about the &quot;lack&quot; of wildlife in N.Z. Lots<br/>\n&gt; of Americans have the notion that N.Z. has LOTS of wildlife (including<br/>\n&gt; me! So you&#39;ll have to educate me).<br/>\n&gt; By the way, I&#39;ve never seen a skink or hedgehog in the wild, so would<br/>\n&gt; find that fascinating to observe....
