If <br/>\nkids were unhappy at our once-big playgroup, we would call on him or Sarah <br/>\nCordova (they&#39;d known each other from infancy) to advise us or just go fix it.  We <br/>\nnever even checked back with them if they said, &quot;Oh.  Yeah.  We&#39;ll talk to <br/>\nthem.&quot;  Between the two of them, they  knew which of them would be best to do the <br/>\nmediation/negotiation/jollying/advising/spinning, or would know which other <br/>\nkid might be better.  They never grandstanded it, they never even made it <br/>\nobvious.  They had a talent and used it in a real-world, direct way, when they were <br/>\ntoo young to know it was remarkable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby was 14 or 15 he counselled an older friend out of a divorce, and <br/>\nhe&#39;s still married a couple of years later and happy about it.  What the hell <br/>\ndid Kirby know about marriage or divorce?!  What he DID know was that his <br/>\nfriend was distraught and not thinking straight, and so he just helped him figure <br/>\nout what he was thinking and feeling.  It was done late night by e-mail or <br/>\ninstant message or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby told me about that one, I said &quot;That&#39;s what marriage counsellors <br/>\ndo for money!&quot; and basically just gave him the &quot;attaboy, good for you&quot; and told <br/>\nhim his friend was really lucky to have him.   Another time I told him he <br/>\nmight someday want to take a psychology class or two to see if he&#39;s interested in <br/>\nthat sort of thing since he already has a talent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Howard Gardner&#39;s intelligences, what Kirby has that makes that happen is a <br/>\ncombination of interpersonal and logical.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIndicating lightly that there are &quot;pursuits&quot; and paid positions involving <br/>\nthose talents isn&#39;t putting pressure on him.  It might just be a side-thing his <br/>\nwhole life.    And I suspect it&#39;s genetic.  I&#39;ve always been one of those <br/>\npeople others tend to confide in lines at grocery stores, or at company barbecues.  <br/>\nOther people are talking about sports and weather, and someone has zeroed in <br/>\non me to tell of sexual dysfunction or spiritual angst or something.    If any <br/>\nof you have a clue why that happens, I&#39;m curious.  Do I SMELL curious!?  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\nI&#39;ve talked to other people that happens to as well, but they didn&#39;t know <br/>\nwhat it was either.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":166495566,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day!","from":"&quot;Have a Nice Day!&quot; &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"rooh_","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: &quot;I&#39;m not good at anything&quot;","postDate":"1080836100","msgId":92379,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDkwMWM0MTgwNCQ3YzQxNWExMCQwMjAxYThjMEBhby5sb3AuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDUxLjNjYWQ1NzIwLjJkOWQ5NGYzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":92377,"nextInTopic":92380,"prevInTime":92378,"nextInTime":92380,"topicId":92335,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So then....

Most people give up on drawing around fifth grade because it is the first <br/>\ntime they realize that the pleasure they take in drawing isn&#39;t producing accurate <br/>\nrepresentational drawing. They have, for the first time, an awareness of what &quot;good <br/>\ndrawing&quot; is. And they know suddenly (and with disappointment) that theirs isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately in our current educational model, we assume that drawing is some kind of <br/>\ndivinely imparted gift and can&#39;t be taught. So thousands of adults believe they are &quot;bad&quot; at <br/>\ndrawing and quit at about age ten. Truth is, we can all be taught to draw (I learned as an <br/>\nadult and erased that feeling for life...). If someone realizes that how she draws isn&#39;t good <br/>\nenough, more training and support can release her from that feeling and give her the <br/>\ncompetence she craves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I think of a fifteen year old saying he isn&#39;t good at anything, I think of someone who <br/>\nis for the first time aware of what it means to be good at something... taking pleasure in <br/>\nan activity isn&#39;t the same as mastery or competence. But that&#39;s a wonderful moment if it <br/>\ncan be seized and explored. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he knows what he wishes to be good at, then it&#39;s possible to work toward that end - <br/>\nlessons, mentoring, volunteering, more time devoted each day, seminars, computer <br/>\nprograms... whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he doesn&#39;t know what he wishes to be good at, then more time of exploration will be <br/>\nhelpful (and it will be natural that he won&#39;t be good at what he explores while he&#39;s still <br/>\nexploring....). He just needs to know that when he knows what interests him, he can <br/>\nbecome good at it, competent. There are means to that end that he can pursue and he has <br/>\nplenty of time to get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] &quot;I&#39;m not good at anything&quot;","postDate":"1080741856","msgId":92346,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Ni4yNWI5OWI1MC4yZDljMjllMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":92344,"nextInTopic":92347,"prevInTime":92345,"nextInTime":92347,"topicId":92335,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/31/2004 8:47:13 AM Eastern Standard Time, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: Very few 15 year olds are good at anything in one way of looking at","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1469118807\">In a message dated 3/31/2004 8:47:13 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\nVery few 15 year olds are &quot;good at anything&quot; in one way of looking at it.  <br/>\nFew of them could make a living at that moment at something really flashy and <br/>\nimpressive.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think that what has made it easier for Cameron is that he WAS really <br/>\ngood at something at 12.

Ask me if I know about mood swings! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes teens need a LOT of reassurance. So just keep showing him <br/>\nyour confidence in him  at the same time that you understand and <br/>\nsympathize with his fears. It is sometimes harder on our unschooled <br/>\nkids at this age than their schooled counterparts because our kids are <br/>\nentering adulthood eyes wide open - they &quot;get it&quot; that they are moving <br/>\ninto adult responsibilities, etc., and they are (justifiably) sometimes <br/>\nfreaked out by it all. The schooled kids more often don&#39;t really grasp <br/>\nwhat&#39;s coming - they&#39;re just following orders, going through the <br/>\nexpected motions. Our unschooled kids are thinking - and their thoughts <br/>\ncan be overwhelming and scary and they can easily feel inadequate to <br/>\nface the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp him understand that he isn&#39;t supposed to be especially great at <br/>\nanything - he&#39;s just entering the time of his life where he MIGHT start <br/>\nto focus in on some things to eventually become good at, but he has <br/>\ntime, there is no hurry and you really hope he&#39;ll continue to enjoy his <br/>\nlife and not worry yet about what he&#39;s &quot;good at,&quot; but just explore all <br/>\nhis options and do what satisfies him, for now. Some people specialize <br/>\nand become really good at something while they&#39;re young, but others <br/>\ndabble in a variety of activities and they know a little about a lot of <br/>\nthings and that&#39;s good too even if it seems like they aren&#39;t super good <br/>\nat anything in particular. That will come later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mar 30, 2004, at 8:14 PM, Have a Nice Day! wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Ok, what can I say to my son?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He is 15 and told me today he doesn&#39;t think he is good at anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After unschooling and encouraging him and being there etc etc <br/>\n&gt; etc....HOW is it I have a child who feels this way?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kristen, who feels like a failure now<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I am just now coming out of the the first wave of this teen <br/>\nangst storm with my oldest dd (16). She did alot of questioning herself, us, <br/>\nthe world, and what is her purpose?. Such heavy thinking for a young person.   <br/>\nAll you can do is keep being supportive, keep him busy, <br/>\nand learn to fly in under his radar to redirect his thoughts toward the <br/>\npostive things in his life.  <br/>\nWhatever his passions are...use them, expand on them, help him find <br/>\nactivities in the community that utilize his talents. Find new and exciting things to <br/>\ndo (some days this is hard, because nothing is exciting and they aren&#39;t <br/>\ninterested, but try anyway).<br/>\nMy daughter is a gifted writer, artist, musician, web designer, and much <br/>\nmore, but to her she was terrible at everything.  She was so hard on herself, and <br/>\nI was feeling very helpless. She has weathered this storm, and has a better <br/>\nunderstanding of herself, and her goals in life...at least for now.<br/>\nIt can be very frustrating, because one minute they are professing how much <br/>\nthey love you, and the next their head is spinning, then they are depressed, <br/>\nand it starts over again. :D  Just remember don&#39;t take it to heart, <br/>\nbecause...This too shall pass!
