I would never<br/>\n&gt; say it to my older children, because they already know it is their<br/>\n&gt; choice.  I just wanted them to know that they did not have to only have<br/>\n&gt; the choice of throwing a fit.  I think the clue is in your motive.

So keep in mind that I may be totally missing <br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt strikes me that if you have a kid who refuses to fulfill a simple, <br/>\nreasonable request (&quot;Please throw the apple core into the garbage.&quot;), you <br/>\nalready have a problem pattern going on. It&#39;s one thing if the kid says, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to as soon as I finish this life on the Playstation game,&quot; which is a <br/>\nreasonable response. (We owe it to our kids, I think, to try to function <br/>\nWITHOUT sticks up our butts. And not agreeing to that reasonable delay WOULD <br/>\nimply &quot;control issues.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think respect for our kids is VERY important. I also think that respect for <br/>\nparents is. By that I do not mean immediate, blind obedience. I THINK (again, <br/>\nremembering that I have an easy kid) that Julian responds positively, and <br/>\nusually in a timely manner, to requests we make of him because history has <br/>\nproven that we generally make reasonable requests.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Another disclaimer: I would love passionately to believe that Julian&#39;s <br/>\ngeneral positive attitude and &quot;obedience&quot; (if you want to call it that--I <br/>\nthink of it as cooperation) is because of our superior parenting skills. And <br/>\nhaving just one child I could probably blissfully assume that that is the <br/>\ncase---but I really don&#39;t think so. I think he&#39;s just like that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24762,"nextTopicId":24788}}
