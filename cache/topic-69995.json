I was just telling Glena offlist that even though I was <br/>\ntrying to help YOU, I really in truly helped myself.  It&#39;s so easy to sit by <br/>\nmyself, removed from the stress and post things like this.  Not because it <br/>\nisn&#39;t true but because it isn&#39;t always that way.  I have bad days.  Baaaad <br/>\ndays.  But when I take the time to write about them, for myself or others, I <br/>\nhave something tangible to turn to.  Someone to remind me that most of the <br/>\ntime, I&#39;m doing the right thing.  That I&#39;m NOT alone!  Isn&#39;t that <br/>\nglorious!?!?!<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like the mother hen here, but I&#39;m so proud of you for sharing your <br/>\nfrustrations.  It&#39;s hard to admit when we are down.   Scary to think that <br/>\nsomeone might consider us bad parents.  I love it that you feel safety in <br/>\nthis list as I do.  I am honored that everyone who responded and possibly <br/>\nmany more were touched and affected by my experiences, for I am touched and <br/>\naffected daily by this list.  This is truly a wonderful group of women (and <br/>\nmen too!) with fascinating, inspiring and heartfelt stories that change my <br/>\nlife everytime I log on and check in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys!  I can&#39;t wait to meet as many of you as possible in SC!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI snipped just a piece of your post (below) about your current stresses <br/>\n(and, boy, do I feel for you!) and I noticed that, even when you didn&#39;t feel <br/>\nvery patient, you acted in a patient way.  With all that is going on in your <br/>\nlife just now, I wanted to say kudos to you for not blowing up!<br/>\n<br/>\nNicholina<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69872,"nextTopicId":69997}}
