I was defined growing up in two ways: there was the <br/>\nidentity I had within my dysfunctional and heavily emotionally <br/>\nabusive family, and the identity I was given by teachers and peers <br/>\nwithin the &quot;school&quot; structure.  With both identities, achievement <br/>\nand good behavior were key.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most difficult part for me as a mo so far is to not pass that <br/>\nidentity on to my children.  My kids tend to hit landmarks earlier <br/>\nthan other kids and also be pretty well-behaved (well, my first was <br/>\nwhat you would call &quot;well-behaved&quot;); this of course made me feel <br/>\nlike a &quot;good mom.&quot;  About a year ago I realized how hard I was <br/>\npushing my daughter to learn; how much pride I was getting from the <br/>\nthings she *achieved,* and that understanding is what led me to the <br/>\nidea of unschooling.  I&#39;ve just started a book called &quot;don&#39;t push <br/>\nyour preschooler.&quot;  My husband was pointing out that Orion doesn&#39;t <br/>\ndo a lot of what Morgaine did at his age, naming colors and shapes, <br/>\nreciting the alphabet, identifying letters.  It made me happy.  He&#39;s <br/>\nenjoying his babyhood -- not that Morgaine didn&#39;t enjoy hers, but he <br/>\nhas more freedom just to *be.*  Isaac, at 7 wks, is also benefitting <br/>\nfrom my learning -- he hasn&#39;t rolled over yet -- because he hasn&#39;t <br/>\nbeen put down long enough.  I don&#39;t feel the pressure to give <br/>\nhim &quot;tummy time&quot; so he can learn to crawl and roll like I did the <br/>\nother two.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t it wonderful to be able to step back sometimes and just see?<br/>\n<br/>\nKristi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":153314598,"authorName":"moonwindstarsky","from":"&quot;moonwindstarsky&quot; &lt;moonwindstarsky@...&gt;","profile":"moonwindstarsky","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: school was like a crutch for me","postDate":"1082924736","msgId":93159,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM2aDZzMCtmMWJiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNTEwMWM0MmFmNCQ2MzE0YTI2MCQ2NDAxYThjMEB3b3d3YXkuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":93138,"nextInTopic":93171,"prevInTime":93158,"nextInTime":93160,"topicId":93138,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have that experience also.
