I imagine the trauma comes<br/>\nfrom the baby&#39;s head banging on things like the cervix to start labor and<br/>\npushing down through the birth canal with the rest of the body&#39;s weight<br/>\nfollowing. Not to mention all of the time the baby is head down before it is<br/>\nborn. Can you imagine what standing on your head for 4 months must do to<br/>\nyour back? LOL. As for what people did before chiro...nothing. I don&#39;t think<br/>\nit&#39;s harmful not to go I just think it can&#39;t hurt to go. As for the frequent<br/>\nadjutments, I do that by choice. I know things are different if you&#39;re<br/>\ninjured, but I go because it makes my back feel good, takes tension from my<br/>\nneck, etc. My chiro. has a poster up that compares chiro treatments to<br/>\northodontic care. If you go to the ortho for frequent tightnings, etc and<br/>\ntake good care of your teeth between visits, the better the end result will<br/>\nbe. I hope that  answeres some of your ?&#39;s, I&#39;ll try to get more.<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MorelFam@...\">MorelFam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, April 12, 2000 12:48 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] birth and continual adjustments<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; amy,<br/>\n&gt; maybe you and some others with an understanding of chiro can help me see<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; the justification for birth being so traumatic is?  how can something so<br/>\n&gt; natural by design cause such havoc on the system?  what did people do<br/>\nbefore<br/>\n&gt; chiropractic?  i have heard this before but it has never made sense to me<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; i am willing to listen...  also, why the continual adjustments?  what do<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt; keep doing to ourselves in the course of our days where we&#39;d need to keep<br/>\n&gt; going and going to keep getting adjusted?  i guess the thought of being so<br/>\n&gt; dependent is unappealing, too.<br/>\n&gt; erin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Avoid the lines and visit avis.com for quick and easy online<br/>\n&gt; reservations.
