I&#39;m trying to gain some perspective over all the situations. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case I&#39;m speaking of now, yes the dad knows. He, not the bio dad, is listed on the birth certificate. The child is 5. There is some question of legalities, and adoption is being considered. There is no chance of getting a medical history from bio-dad. Yes, we have a rather snooty part of the family, but that is the only family the child would have. Me and my cousins grew up spending time with all their attitudes, and only one of us ended up with those attitudes for ourselves. We all saw how hurtful the attitudes were. This generation&#39;s children will see the same thing, I&#39;m sure. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Earthmomma67@...\">Earthmomma67@...</a> <br/>\n  I think this has been a confusing discussion because it started out by asking <br/>\n  about adoption but turns out it&#39;s not about that at all. So my first answers <br/>\n  can&#39;t apply.<br/>\n  In the case above, then the child probably shouldn&#39;t be told, but does the <br/>\n  Dad know that the child is not his? That also makes it different. How old is <br/>\n  the child? Is the Dad listed on the birth certificate or is the bio-dad or <br/>\n  &quot;unknown&quot;? Does he need to adopt the child legally and that&#39;s why the <br/>\n  question has come up?<br/>\n<br/>\n  If the dad knows all, the child should be told if he is very young and there <br/>\n  is still a chance that learning this won&#39;t ruin his life (say under 3). As to <br/>\n  the relatives, if they are going to be that snooty, why would one want them <br/>\n  to have an influence over that poor child&#39;s life? Even if that attitude is <br/>\n  not directed at the child, it will still effect him. He&#39;ll learn their <br/>\n  attitude. as to health and DNA, who knows what diseases lurk in the bio-dad&#39;s <br/>\n  genes?
