Even so, the children in schools spend almost<br/>\ntheir entire day NOT interacting with their peers, but instead being made to<br/>\nsit still and shut up and listen mostly to unwanted information doled out by<br/>\nstrangers with mediocre education, suspicious incentives and often unhealthy<br/>\nattitudes -- operating under repressive rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are hurting your kids if you put them in those places. Almost anything<br/>\nis a better experience than that. &quot;Being around other children&quot; is not what<br/>\nschool is for anyway, even though they use &quot;socialization&quot;  when all else<br/>\nfails and we know the children are not happy or learning there.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child needs friends (at least one), not a room full of anxious same-age<br/>\n&quot;others&quot; under artificial circumstances doing busywork isolated from all<br/>\nother human life. In order to find a friend, interaction is required. Summer<br/>\nis a good time for making new friends. So find ways to help them.  I gather<br/>\nthat there are no children living nearby, so it&#39;s summer camp for a week;<br/>\nswimming lessons; baseball, hiking clubs, 4H, etc. Many towns have<br/>\nrecreation directors who run programs for kids all day, every day. Subscribe<br/>\nto the homeschooler newsletters and find out what other parents are doing.<br/>\nIt&#39;s getting so big that people can&#39;t keep up with it all, there are so many<br/>\nactivities and day trips.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren find their own level of comfort. Ask them, and listen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a start.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\n<br/>\nYour being new to unschooling takes time to fully realize how much you are<br/>\nnow responsible for. I often ask in my programs, &quot;Did you have children so<br/>\nthat you can give your kids to the government to raise for you - badly?&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41290,"nextTopicId":41343}}
