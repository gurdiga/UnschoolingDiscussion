Given his feelings about homeschooling (and unschooling) he&#39;s likely to allege educational neglect on your part.  Also, absent physical abuse against the children, he will almost certainly be granted visitation, perhaps even joint custody.  That will mean your kids spend time alone with him, subject to his emotional abuse in your absence.    Even by today&#39;s standards, it&#39;s virtually impossible for one parent to be given total custody -- joint legal custody with liberal visitation for the parent without physical custody is the standard.  <br/>\n <br/>\nFor what it&#39;s worth, if he&#39;s really unwilling to see his problems and part in this, it won&#39;t matter what you do -- he&#39;s not going to change his pattern.  However, if there&#39;s physical abuse, I&#39;m the first to say you need to leave -- with documented evidence of the abuse.<br/>\n <br/>\nI agree it can be a nightmare at times.  I grew up in a home where there was emotional abuse, manipulation, etc. By the standards of those days (60-70&#39;s) courts wouldn&#39;t have found it abusive -- heck, even today courts don&#39;t find spanking with a belt to be abusive in some cases, and emotional abuse is hard to quantify.  My Mom stayed -- at least until her youngest child was old enough to choose custody.  It was still a messy divorce (23 yrs later my parents can&#39;t be in the same room) and we all had much healing to do in adulthood, but I have to admit that her choice to stay certainly made my life easier.  Had she left him and not gotten custody, living with him alone would have been awful.  In his anger and spitefulness following the divorce, even visitation without her there to buffer would have been really hard.<br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!

He says if I would just change myself and do what he wanted, put the kids in school, get my nails done, go to parties and be the trophy wife, and stop spending his money, tthen he would be happy and all of this would change. The problem with all that is I did do all of that, to the point of changing my outward appearance so that I dont even look like me anymore, and he is still not happy. I dont touch his money, he has his own account and I have mine. I am lucky enough to have a job where I can work at home. He isnt rational.

I think, too often, people get locked into feeling like it&#39;s not okay to give support to other adults.  The flip side is that too many of us don&#39;t feel okay asking for support when we need it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI can&#39;t think of anyone I know who doesn&#39;t have some moments of need.  And some need more compassion, or more care, more often than others.  Usually they&#39;re genuinely more hurt, long-term, and really need that support, space and kindness to heal and become whole people.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn a marriage, in good or bad times, doing what one can to help support and maybe heal your partner&#39;s pain is always a good thing.  In all we do, we&#39;re examples to our kids.  Also, no matter how the adults feel about each other, your spouse (or ex-spouse) will always be the other parent to your children.  Isn&#39;t it better to reach out and help your children&#39;s father?  It may be just what he needs to become the father your children deserve, and it shows them how to be compassionate to others.  It also can help everyone involved to see how childhood pain, or even last week&#39;s pain, affects today, and how healing it can save tomorrow.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!
