While I<br/>\n  appreciate the breadth of research that must have gone into it, I didn&#39;t<br/>\n  appreciate the editorial tone of the article. Perhaps I&#39;ve got it wrong - I<br/>\n  read the article on line, so perhaps it really WAS an editorial, but it<br/>\n  seemed to be crediting a host of reporters at the end, not editors.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In any case, such opinions that &quot;it takes a galactic commitment of time and<br/>\n  money and patience for a parent to spend all day, every day, relearning<br/>\n  algebra&quot; do your magazine no credit. Many homeschoolers do not find spending<br/>\n  their time with their children a hardship at all, much less a galactic one.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In addition, the disparagement of the unschooling approach is uncalled for.<br/>\n  At a website called Unschooling.com your reporters could have found many<br/>\n  intelligent and eloquent parents (and children) who unschool and would have<br/>\n  been pleased to tell about their actual difficulties and successes, not the<br/>\n  ones in your reporters&#39; overactive imaginations.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can see that it&#39;s a simple matter to dismiss what you do not understand -<br/>\n  such was the case with homeschooling until we (homeschoolers) proved that<br/>\n  our children would learn at home, and learn well. Now your target, and the<br/>\n  target of other media, seems to be unschooling. Take care what you disparage<br/>\n  today, especially without really looking at who unschoolers are and what<br/>\n  they do. You may be changing your tune in a future homeschooling article,<br/>\n  and wouldn&#39;t that be a bit embarrassing?<br/>\n<br/>\n  My family&#39;s reason for homeschooling is very simple, and coincidentally very<br/>\n  American. It is the self-same reason we own a home business. The reason is:<br/>\n  freedom. My family is free to choose what we will learn, what hours we will<br/>\n  work or study. We are free to discover for ourselves what is the most<br/>\n  important work of any given day. We are free to discuss multiplying by 11&#39;s<br/>\n  at 11:59 p.m., without worrying that someone will be late for school or<br/>\n  work.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Such freedom looks like madness or a fairy tale to most Americans who are in<br/>\n  the 9-5 work-and-school grind. I&#39;m sorry for them, but I won&#39;t join the pack<br/>\n  to make them feel better about their choices. They have the same<br/>\n  opportunities. This  is, after all, still America, and freedom still means<br/>\n  something.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Should you wish to do a follow-up article on unschooling, I&#39;d be happy to<br/>\n  put you in touch with some sources.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Pam Hartley<br/>\n  Tracy, California<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
