But this list is different.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think it&#39;s a lack of understanding that on this list that using words<br/>\nto precisely represent what we mean is important. (In fact it&#39;s so important<br/>\nthat we made it one of our posting suggestions.) When people use words<br/>\ncasually, discussions go on and on (as it did) because people aren&#39;t all<br/>\ngetting the same picture of what the situation is like and they can all be<br/>\ndiscussing something different.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":86914,"nextTopicId":86950}}
