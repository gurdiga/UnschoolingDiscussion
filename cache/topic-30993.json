I came out of a very school-at-home group of home <br/>\n&gt;schoolers and it was hard.  That is why I signed up for this list.  <br/>\n&gt;Virtually every home school co-op, mom&#39;s group, or any other hs group <br/>\n&gt;seemed very curriculum/scheduled/schoolie.  I knew that this wasn&#39;t right <br/>\n&gt;for me or my family.  It came down to having to stay away from these <br/>\n&gt;meetings, which left me little support.  I do know these folks as friends <br/>\n&gt;and fellow believers, but usually we stay away from &quot;education&quot; as a topic. <br/>\n&gt;  I find I have too much explaining to do, they know that I am relaxed and <br/>\n&gt;that&#39;s enough for them.  Maybe when I have more time, but then they seem <br/>\n&gt;very intimidated and threatened sometimes by what I say.  I really don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;mean to say that what they are doing is wrong, but sometimes just telling <br/>\n&gt;them what I think is threatening to them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My faith does not say that I need to have lessons at a certain time of the <br/>\n&gt;day, Christianity does not say to me that I have to make my children learn <br/>\n&gt;certain things at certain times of the day or even certain times in their <br/>\n&gt;lives.  My example and the work of the Holy Spirit in THEIR HEARTS  is the <br/>\n&gt;key.  I provide all the learning tools (as my budget and time allow), my <br/>\n&gt;own curiosity of life and living and learning as an example, and trust God <br/>\n&gt;to work as well in their lives as he does in mine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Blessings,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Elaine<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;   From: ECHSA<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Friday, January 11, 2002 3:15 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Hello<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hi all.<br/>\n&gt;   My name is Cathy, married to Craig, and living in South-Africa. I have 5<br/>\n&gt;   children, who have always been homeschooled, oldest is nearly 12, <br/>\n&gt;youngest<br/>\n&gt;   is 5 months.<br/>\n&gt;   I have always been a fairly flexible/relaxed homeschooler, and<br/>\n&gt;   have never used a pre-packaged curriculum (very unusual around here!!! -<br/>\n&gt;   many people in RSA, I think because of the HS movement still being so <br/>\n&gt;young<br/>\n&gt;   here, would feel VERY insecure without the guidance of their friendly<br/>\n&gt;   curriculum provider...)<br/>\n&gt;   I have been much inspired by the writings of Charlotte Mason, and to a <br/>\n&gt;large<br/>\n&gt;   extent it is due to her that I have become interested in Unschooling -<br/>\n&gt;   although she was not an unschooler, her incredible insights about the <br/>\n&gt;mind<br/>\n&gt;   of the child and having respect for children have laid a definite <br/>\n&gt;foundation<br/>\n&gt;   in my thinking.<br/>\n&gt;   I am particularly interested to clarify whether or not I can be both a<br/>\n&gt;   Christian and an Unschooler without compromising on one or the other - <br/>\n&gt;there<br/>\n&gt;   is fairly heated debate on this topic in homeschooling circles I notice! <br/>\n&gt;In<br/>\n&gt;   the short time that I have been conducting my &#39;&#39;research&#39;&#39;, I have <br/>\n&gt;become<br/>\n&gt;   convinced that it is possible, but I don&#39;t yet know how to explain how <br/>\n&gt;or<br/>\n&gt;   why!! As a result one of the things I am interested in is in<br/>\n&gt;   communicating with people who are Unschooling, and who are Christians, <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;   who feel that it is possible to reconcile the two.<br/>\n&gt;   We are currently conducting an &quot;Unschooling Experiment&quot; in our home (we <br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;   been Unschooling since 9 October), and I am pretty excited <br/>\n&gt;(UNDERSTATEMENT)<br/>\n&gt;   with what I am observing. I am reading John Holt, who, I think,<br/>\n&gt;   introduced the seminal ideas that led to Unschooling, and I am <br/>\n&gt;challenged<br/>\n&gt;   and intrigued. I have also been reading the posts over the last 2 weeks, <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;   am really inspired<br/>\n&gt;   and encouraged.<br/>\n&gt;   I would like to know more, so I am here to learn....I hope all you <br/>\n&gt;veterans<br/>\n&gt;   won&#39;t mind too much answering the same old questions that I am bound to<br/>\n&gt;   ask!! My husband and I have been involved with the leadership of a<br/>\n&gt;   home-schooling association, and therefore know how much patience is <br/>\n&gt;required<br/>\n&gt;   when those really basic, level I questions keep being asked... :-)<br/>\n&gt;   Blessings<br/>\n&gt;   Cathy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!
