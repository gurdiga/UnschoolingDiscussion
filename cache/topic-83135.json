None of this is treating other family members with respect.  They had complete freedom to act this way.  They also had complete freedom to play quietly and either clean up after themselves or not make such a mess in the first place.    They used their freedom and chose the activities that led Mom to believe that her children were not ready for the freedom she allowed.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut giving the kids freedom (e.g. when to go to bed), leaving them alone in their choices to do whatever, and then being upset about the choices they made and revoking that freedom, is not unschooling.  I&#39;m not saying this is what Heidi did, it&#39;s just the direction the discussion has gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is more than one path from point A (kids being loud & messy) to point B (parents sleeping peacefully without waking to a large mess).  Enforcing bedtimes is just one possible path to point B.  But it&#39;s an authoritarian path that gives the kids the impression that they only have these freedoms if their choices match mine (my preconceived notions about which path they should choose).  And this attitude is not very conducive to unschooling, as the kids may conclude that the parent may take away other freedoms, such as not doing &quot;schoolwork&quot; etc, at any arbitrary time that the parent decides they are not making the &quot;right choices&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, the parent could discuss the issue with the kids.  The kids need to know how their choices are affecting others; they may not realize it on their own. For example explaining &quot;the noise you make after I go to bed is waking me up during the night.  I&#39;m not getting a good night&#39;s sleep so I feel tired and cranky in the morning.&quot;  And then brainstorming some solutions on how they can keep the noise level down.  Or get some food without making a huge mess.  You get the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the discussions are definitely geared to the child&#39;s age.  With younger kids, maybe you can offer up more interesting choices, like lets go up to your room and read a favourite story, watch a favourite movie etc.  And as they get older, maybe &quot;light time&quot; as someone suggested, time in their room to pursue quiet activities of their choice is an acceptable solution to get to point B for everyone involved.  And as they get older still, maybe just friendly reminders to keep it down, turn off the lights etc. before you go up to bed.  This are just other paths that can get you to point B, not guaranteed solutions for everyone.  The point is that the parents need to talk with their kids to work out solutions that are amenable to everyone involved.  This way the kids learn how to make good decisions and choices - choosing the best path for them from point A to B while considering how their choices affect others involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, for example, when I realized my son wanted tea in the evenings after I went to bed, I first put out on the counter all the stuff he&#39;d need, filled the kettle, and wrote basic instructions (including toss the tea bag in the sink).  I did that for a few nights, then the instructions fell by the wayside and I just left the stuff out.  After a couple weeks, he can take care of it all himself.  And though I mention any larger mess I find in the morning (like &quot;when you make such and such, can you please put this and that in the garbage&quot; etc.), give reminders to &quot;please turn out all the lights before you go to bed&quot;, and occasionally get up to ask them to &quot;please turn/keep it down, it&#39;s too loud for me to sleep&quot;, I do enjoy coming down in the morning and figuring out what they&#39;ve done and eaten ... it keeps me in touch!<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":82092636,"authorName":"Sharon Caldwell","from":"&quot;Sharon Caldwell&quot; &lt;nms@...&gt;","profile":"learningcommunity2005","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: I&#39;m on the verge!...","postDate":"1067098447","msgId":83221,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJuZTdnZityZnQ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDMxLjNmOTZjNWU4LjJjY2FhZjA5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":83218,"nextInTopic":83224,"prevInTime":83220,"nextInTime":83222,"topicId":83135,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I reset my message rules to not get mail a while ago because I was not coping with all my work plus all my group mail and have just come into the group site to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-821071732\">I reset my message rules to not get mail a while ago because I was <br/>\nnot coping with all my work plus all my group mail and have just come <br/>\ninto the group site to see what has been happening.

In our house the <br/>\nelectronics are all central (no phones, tvs or computers in bedrooms) but we&#39;ve <br/>\nalways had a tape/CD player by each bed with an assortment of books on tape (the <br/>\nHarry Potter ones by Jim Dale are award-winning and truly wonderful - we <br/>\nlisten to them in the car on trips and all enjoy them)  The teen has several <br/>\njournals going and is writing plays and stories, and also is experimenting with art, <br/>\nknitting and crafts, mostly because she&#39;s discovered these as things she can <br/>\nenjoy during the hours after she officially retires to her room. I have no <br/>\nidea what time she usually gets to sleep now, but judging from the hours at which <br/>\nshe rises, I would say there have been some pretty wee hours of light time on <br/>\na regular basis! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n       Anyway, didn&#39;t mean to go on about it -- I just wanted to say that the <br/>\nconcept of &quot;light time&quot; rather than &quot;bedtime&quot; worked well for us.

In fact, two games that Robby has <br/>\nbrought into the house, I have beat him. Play them more than he does <br/>\n(he plays others)...and I&#39;ve read and find myself agreeing with the <br/>\narticles touting computer games as learning tools (BeetleJunior, <br/>\nChips Challenge, Dynomite: Puzzle games, with mazes, problem solving, <br/>\nquick thinking, perfect timing, etc...um, sorta like the kinds of <br/>\nthings found on standardized tests, eh?...) So I don&#39;t have a problem <br/>\nwith my kids &quot;doing nothing&quot; while playing. I know they ARE doing <br/>\nthings, yea verily, amazing things, when they are playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich, thinking about it, if it is the case that they&#39;re doing <br/>\namazing things while computerizing, I shouldn&#39;t be fretting about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s see here. Maybe telling on a guy I dated will clarify me a bit. <br/>\nDon was a nice fellow: decent, calm, kind. A dry, kind of bizaare <br/>\nsense of humor. VERY attached to his possessions, and owned two of <br/>\nnearly everything (two guitars; two cars; two identical pancake <br/>\nturners...) anyway. Nice guy. We went out for about half a year, and <br/>\none date was a picnic. We hit the grocery store first, to pick up <br/>\nthings for the picnic. As we walked in the door, there was a TV <br/>\nplaying...and Don stopped there for a full five minutes, to watch! <br/>\nSince I was living at home at the time, he met my folks. Invariably, <br/>\nwhen we were in the front room, if the TV was on, (as it usually was) <br/>\nDon dropped out of the conversation and got completely absorbed in <br/>\nwhatever was on. You couldn&#39;t even interrupt his gaze for a <br/>\ncommercial. This, in a grown man.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll say &quot;he didn&#39;t get enough time to watch as a kid&quot; NO, <br/>\naccording to his mom, he was glued to the TV for his spare time <br/>\nthrough pretty much his whole childhood. (Okay, okay, &quot;spare time&quot; <br/>\nsheesh) It just seemed to me that this guy COULDN&#39;T get enough time <br/>\nbefore the screen, and!!! that he was pulled into it entirely: his <br/>\nwhole psyche involved and nothing could pull him away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, I do not want for my kids. But to be completely objective (as I <br/>\nalways am LOL)...my kids already aren&#39;t as exaggeratedly into it as <br/>\nDon was. Thus, my worries that they will be &quot;Don&#39;s&quot; is baseless, and <br/>\nI should quit fretting.

Then they come in the bedroom with us and play <br/>\nquietly in there until they are tired.

If they get a bit <br/>\nnoisy I ask them to take it into the hallway outside the door so as not to <br/>\nbother us.

Our family lives in the &quot;regular&quot; world, where Daddy<br/>\nhas to be up rather early and sometimes he gets home on time, sometimes he&#39;s<br/>\npretty late.  Individual bedtimes simply won&#39;t work.  I don&#39;t know how old<br/>\nyour kids are, either.  Mine are not old enough to be up unsupervised and I<br/>\ncan&#39;t possibly spread my waking hours to accomodate four different<br/>\nchildren&#39;s body clocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith freedom comes responsibility.  If your kids are not going to use their<br/>\nfreedom to choose their own bedtimes wisely, they really can&#39;t have that<br/>\nfreedom.  If it isn&#39;t working for your family, it&#39;s not something you should<br/>\ndo.  If you really want it to work, you can try tweaking things here and<br/>\nthere and ease on into it.  But you might want to think about exactly why<br/>\nyou think/want your kids to be able to go to bed when they want.  Do you<br/>\nthink it&#39;s good for them?  Good for the family?  Necessary?  If you think<br/>\n&quot;yes&quot; to these questions, then you&#39;ll work out an acceptable solution.
