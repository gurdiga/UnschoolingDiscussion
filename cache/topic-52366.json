The one about nuclear bombs <br/>\non a truck trying to get out of Russia was too much for me.  (Keith says <br/>\n&quot;Peacemaker.&quot;) Because it was video I could turn it off and recover.  The <br/>\nBourne Identity was a bit much.   I still haven&#39;t watched the first Mad Max <br/>\nmovie, and just the other day when we read there will be a fourth one, my <br/>\nhusband reminded me I probably still don&#39;t want to watch that first one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like chick flicks.  I like historicals.  I especially like movies that have <br/>\nto do with the nature of reality, or with a young irritating man growing into <br/>\nmaturity, or with ethics and morality.  And I know I haven&#39;t seen them all, <br/>\nso feel free to make recommendations!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome I was thinking of as I wrote this:<br/>\n<br/>\nnature of reality,  (Last Action Hero, The Matrix [I overlooked the violence <br/>\nto get Lawrence Fishburn and nature-of-reality], Rosencrantz and Guildenstern <br/>\nare Dead)<br/>\n<br/>\nor with a young irritating boy/man growing into maturity,   (Guarding Tess, <br/>\nSeven Years in Tibet, Brother Sun/Sister Moon, The Karate Kid, About a Boy)<br/>\n<br/>\nor with ethics and morality (The Emperor&#39;s Club, Crimson Tide, El Cid, Ben <br/>\nHur)<br/>\n<br/>\nAction just for the sake of action, like Air Force One or Executive Decision <br/>\nor The Rock, those aren&#39;t physically comfortable for me to watch.  Die Hard; <br/>\ntoo much.   Well-Drillers in Space I kinda liked, for the cast, but the <br/>\ndramatic tension isn&#39;t good for my part me &quot;it&#39;s only a movie.&quot;  If I forget <br/>\nfor even two or three minutes, I can get uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, just throwing data in for consideration</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: so called guy movies was park day\tand school kids","postDate":"1040313612","msgId":52398,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBMjc1NzNDLjEwRUI2JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0ZS4xOTA4MGI1MC4yYjMzMzA2YkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52366,"nextInTopic":52410,"prevInTime":52397,"nextInTime":52399,"topicId":52366,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
