They only know what *schooled* kids are like. They know<br/>\nthe &quot;normal&quot; way that kids adapt to being forced to spend 6 or more house a<br/>\nday in an artificial environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen school is taken out of the mix, then therapists are lost without<br/>\nrealizing it. The personalities and reactions of homeschooled kids are<br/>\ndifferent than schooled kids. Without having to compensate for forced<br/>\nsocialization and forced learning, kids behave differently. And some of<br/>\nthose different behaviors would be irrational and unworkable in school.<br/>\n(Like an 8 yo who still clings to her mother in social situations.) So<br/>\ntherapists are going to assume that the child has problems when the only<br/>\n&quot;problem&quot; the child has is not having to adjust themselves to the unnatural<br/>\nenvironment of school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSociety thinks it&#39;s normal for 4, 5 and 6 yos to be out navigating the world<br/>\non their own for 6+ hours a day. But when it&#39;s expressed like that, why<br/>\n*would* it be normal? Why would a 4-6 yo need to be away from his or her<br/>\nfamily? Kids adapt. But kids adapt to being homeless too. Just because kids<br/>\ncan find a way to cope, doesnt mean that something is good for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two problems mixed together. There&#39;s the damage that school did to<br/>\nyour son. And there may be personality factors. First I&#39;d deal with the<br/>\ndamage done by school. I&#39;d help him feel safe at home. (And if he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nenjoy online relationships and your making him, then he isn&#39;t going to feel<br/>\nsafe. Home won&#39;t feel like a haven for who he is. It&#39;s going to feel like<br/>\nanother place where he needs to be something he&#39;s not in order to be<br/>\naccepted.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLater I&#39;d help him find a comfort level of being with other kids. It could<br/>\nbe he&#39;s an introvert and really doesn&#39;t need other people much. Being an<br/>\nintrovert I can asure you enjoying being alone is perfectly normal! It could<br/>\nbe he much prefers one on one with another child who shares his interests.<br/>\nThat could be more difficutl to find but it may be what he needs and well<br/>\nworth the effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How are we supposed to know? We<br/>\n&gt; are trying to do what is best for our son and like I said before we have a<br/>\n&gt; lot to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not an easy question to answer. We&#39;re kind of trained to accept what<br/>\nexperts tell us. We&#39;ve learned to accept that &quot;truth&quot; may not make much<br/>\nsense and just trust experts that know a lot more than we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo perhaps look at who your son is right now and help him be who *he* wants<br/>\nto be. Give him opportunities to stretch and grow, but make the focus not on<br/>\nwhat you want for him, but on what he wants for himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96545052,"authorName":"marji","from":"marji &lt;marji@...&gt;","profile":"gaia10921","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:Sandra (oops)","postDate":"1047207361","msgId":60541,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMi4wLjkuMC4yMDAzMDMwOTAyNTQyNC4wMjc0ODljMEBtYWlsLmdhaWF3b2xmLm9yZz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDUuMi4wLjkuMC4yMDAzMDMwOTAyMjc1MC4wMjc1MmVjMEBtYWlsLmdhaWF3b2xmLm9yZz4=","referencesHeader":"PDExOS4yMDIxY2MzOC4yYjljNjY3Y0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60540,"nextInTopic":60553,"prevInTime":60540,"nextInTime":60542,"topicId":23392,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

After <br/>\nthe experience he had in school, I&#39;d say that any fear he has of other <br/>\nchildren is a reasonable response to a bad situation.  We are all made of <br/>\ndifferent stuff.  Some folks might want to rush back into a situation like <br/>\nthat with their chests all puffed up; others would not (I&#39;m one of the <br/>\n&#39;others&#39;).  Your honoring Who He Is by allowing him to approach this <br/>\nsituation in the way that works best for him is not the &quot;problem,&quot; as those <br/>\ntwo therapists told you.  I think it&#39;s part of the solution.  Another thing <br/>\nthat I think would be part of the solution is for him to be able to talk to <br/>\nyou ~ in his own time ~ about what he&#39;s feeling and thinking and how he <br/>\nviews the world.  You are his safe harbor.  You can be his nonjudgmental <br/>\nsounding board who listens compassionately and only gives advice when asked.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;They then continued to tell us that if we were to homeschool him and there <br/>\n&gt;was no choice but to get him penpals, online<br/>\n&gt;buddies, etc., for his own mental well being.

Their <br/>\nprescriptions for his &quot;mental well being&quot; may be helpful and may not (i.e., <br/>\nwhat if one of the online penpals turns out to be not such a nice <br/>\nperson?).  I hear that you are trying to do what is best for your son, but <br/>\nI think you can give yourself a lot more credit; we all have a lot to learn <br/>\n(that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing on this Earth, I believe).  You have the gift of <br/>\nyour instincts and your obvious love for your son.  I think that following <br/>\nyour instincts, listening to your heart, and relying on the knowledge that <br/>\nno one knows your son better than you do will help you help him more than <br/>\nanything or anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son is enjoying his time online, great.
