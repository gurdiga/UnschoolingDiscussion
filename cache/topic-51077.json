It is<br/>\nprobably a biological imperative. So - what you could notice in this is a<br/>\npassion for experiencing interactions with people. Help her get as much of<br/>\nit as possible. Texting and facebooking are great ways to learn all about<br/>\npeople and how they react and respond and what they think and so on. She<br/>\nmight be interested in some other activities that support that same<br/>\ninterest. Polls are often big for girls at that age. My oldest daughter, at<br/>\n13, had a couple of books that were filled with psychological questionnaires<br/>\nand loved to go around having all her friends fill them out (pre-facebook). <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThink of this as supporting her ability to be a wonderful friend and wife<br/>\nand mother and coworker - in the future. She&#39;s learning about the variety of<br/>\nhuman experience - how people are the same and different. She&#39;ll almost<br/>\ncertainly be disappointed in some of her friends - they won&#39;t be as honest<br/>\nas she thinks they should be or they&#39;ll be mean or petty or something. And<br/>\nshe&#39;ll learn to deal with that. And she&#39;ll learn to speak up for what she<br/>\nbelieves in and when to just be quiet and not argue and on and on. Great<br/>\nstuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to &quot;do things&quot; together - try to be creative and focus on things<br/>\nthat have relationships as their core. And, of course, include her friends<br/>\nin things. If you want to go to an art museum, take a couple of her friends<br/>\nalong. If you think of something she might enjoy - baking, etc. - invite a<br/>\nfriend to do it with her. Support this interest - it is a great one!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - watch tv and movies and talk about the relationships. Good time for<br/>\nchick-flicks and romantic comedy.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78881874,"authorName":"emiLy Quick","from":"emiLy Quick &lt;emilyjo@...&gt;","profile":"hanlone","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] when your child doesn&#39;t seem interested in learning","postDate":"1267025755","msgId":51104,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc1NTEyRURGLTFGMjEtNDFGNi1BNTZELUQ5MkJCNUUyODE0RUBlbWlseWpvLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE4NjM3Ni4xNjAzLnFtQHdlYjExMTgwNS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDU3ODAwOS44MjI4NS5xbUB3ZWIxMTE4MTgubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPiA8QTdBMUY5NEItQjZDNi00MDlDLTk1NUUtODQwNjY5MUQ2OEVDQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8MTg2Mzc2LjE2MDMucW1Ad2ViMTExODA1Lm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":51100,"nextInTopic":51105,"prevInTime":51103,"nextInTime":51105,"topicId":51077,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

In the teenage years, she found that the thing that was most important to them was connections with their peers.  Her idea for junior high/ high school was a place where kids that age could be extremely extremely SOCIAL with people of all ages and types.  One example was them (a whole group of teen peers, like a classroom) running a bed & breakfast so they&#39;d meet tons and tons of new people all the time.  They&#39;d also interact with their peers all the time, in a meaningful way in order to accomplish day to day tasks. <br/>\n<br/>\nRunning an inn is the &quot;learning&quot; part of it, but the real part of what she found is that teens are SOCIAL and this is how they learn at that age, no matter what they are doing.  I&#39;m sure your daughter will get back to other things she enjoys.  Perhaps you could look for teen groups she could get together with, or ask her if she&#39;d like to try a job somewhere she could be social.  Or just let her be, doing what she&#39;s doing, and enjoy.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-emiLy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129999023,"authorName":"John and Amanda Slater","from":"John and Amanda Slater &lt;fourslaterz@...&gt;","profile":"fourslaterz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] when your child doesn&#39;t seem interested in learning","postDate":"1267017562","msgId":51089,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIyMTIwLjE2NjQucW1Ad2ViNTM5MDIubWFpbC5yZTIueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhFNjZBODEyLTlFMjUtNDIxNC1BNTY2LUE0MTc1MTA2RjMzM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDU3ODAwOS44MjI4NS5xbUB3ZWIxMTE4MTgubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPiA8QTdBMUY5NEItQjZDNi00MDlDLTk1NUUtODQwNjY5MUQ2OEVDQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8MTg2Mzc2LjE2MDMucW1Ad2ViMTExODA1Lm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDhFNjZBODEyLTlFMjUtNDIxNC1BNTY2LUE0MTc1MTA2RjMzM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":51087,"nextInTopic":51090,"prevInTime":51088,"nextInTime":51090,"topicId":51077,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You might want to check out Roya s speech at the 2005 Live and Learn Conference.
