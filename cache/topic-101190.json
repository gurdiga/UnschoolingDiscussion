Willard and Doug Oplinger<br/>\nBeacon Journal staff writers<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily Fritts was 6 years old when her mother abducted her in <br/>\nStaunton, Va.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the next eight years, Mary Outlaw Fritts and Emily lived on the <br/>\nrun in at least five other states: Tennessee, Oregon, Kansas, Alaska <br/>\nand Montana. They assumed new identities, becoming Mary and Emily <br/>\nStutz.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Fritts took an additional step to keep her secret, something she <br/>\ncould not have done as easily 10 or 20 years earlier in most states: <br/>\nShe home-schooled Emily.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach year, thousands of parents in custody cases abduct their <br/>\nchildren. These parents must elude spouses, the police, state <br/>\nagencies, the FBI and a legion of organizations dedicated to finding <br/>\nmissing children.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents who abduct children live quiet lives on the run. They canmove <br/>\ninto a community, claim they are home schooling and avoid answering <br/>\nquestions or providing proof of their past.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many abductors home-school?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one knows.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one is trying to find out.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if someone were to attempt to determine the extent of the <br/>\nproblem, most state laws are written so loosely that it is impossible <br/>\nto track children through a system they have in common: education.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen children move from one public school to the next, their records <br/>\nfollow them. Most private schools request prior academic files, <br/>\nalthough some private schools -- mainly religious ones -- do not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Ohio, parents notify their school district that they are going to <br/>\nhome-school. They do not need to ask for permission.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe local superintendent cannot ask any questions about the family or <br/>\nchildren, including where the family lived prior to moving into the <br/>\ndistrict. Requesting prior academic records is forbidden.<br/>\n<br/>\nOhio is considered a moderate state for oversight and accountability.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Colorado, home-schooling parents must notify a school district, <br/>\nbut not necessarily the one in which they live. A parent who wants to <br/>\nhome-school can register with a district separated by more than 100 <br/>\nmiles of mountainous terrain, making it difficult for that district <br/>\nto check on the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other states, such as Texas and Michigan, where home-schooling <br/>\nlaws are even looser, families are not required to notify their <br/>\ndistrict. In these states, compulsory education has, in effect, been <br/>\nabandoned.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Emily&#39;s father, Rodney Fritts, the eight years trying to find his <br/>\ndaughter were frustrating and expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nFour FBI agents and the National Center for Missing and Exploited <br/>\nChildren offered no answers, so Fritts paid $50,000 to hire a private <br/>\ninvestigator. Overall, the ordeal cost him $450,000 in attorney&#39;s <br/>\nfees and losses he incurred trying to keep up the search.<br/>\n<br/>\n``It was like looking for a needle in a haystack,&#39;&#39; he said. ``When <br/>\n(Emily) first disappeared, I thought she would be home-schooled <br/>\nbecause there was no way she was going to be put in public <br/>\nschools.... ,&#39;&#39; Fritts said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe push to find children<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a series of high-profile kidnapping, rape and murder cases in <br/>\nthe late 1990s, the federal government and most state legislatures <br/>\npassed laws to alert communities to potential threats from sex <br/>\noffenders and other criminals.<br/>\n<br/>\nStates also createdimmediate-response systems, called Amber Alerts, <br/>\nthat are triggered as soon as a child is reported missing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, formed by <br/>\nCongress in 1984 as a private, nonprofit organization, is a <br/>\nclearinghouse for information about abducted, endangered and sexually <br/>\nexploited children. The agency works closely with the FBI and U.S. <br/>\nDepartment of Justice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe department&#39;s most recent survey on missing children is a snapshot <br/>\nof 1999, when 1.3 million new cases were reported. The number of long-<br/>\nterm abductions -- the type that might require home schooling to <br/>\nmaintain obscurity -- is much smaller.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Beacon Journal analysis of national center data from 1990 through <br/>\nthe summer of 2004 found that 1,000 to 1,200 long-term cases of <br/>\nmissing children involving a family member are reported to the center <br/>\nannually.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo data kept on any link<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the national center, the FBI and the Justice Department were <br/>\nasked whether home schooling hindered attempts to locate missing <br/>\nchildren, the question appeared to catch spokesmen off guard.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul Bresson, an FBI spokesman, said his agency does not have data <br/>\nlinking abductions and home schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n``We&#39;ve seen a few cases where that has happened,&#39;&#39; Bresson said. <br/>\n``It&#39;s probably more than likely something has probably happened in <br/>\nthe past, maybe even on more than one occasion, but how pervasive it <br/>\nis or how frequently those kinds of scenarios come up, I don&#39;t know.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said the FBI has similar difficulty tracking children through the <br/>\npublic school system because privacy laws prevent state education <br/>\ndepartments from compiling specific information on individual <br/>\nstudents.<br/>\n<br/>\nJustice Department officials reiterated the FBI&#39;s assertions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe national center said it received 14,980 reports of a noncustodial <br/>\nparent abducting a child between 1990 and July 2004. The center <br/>\nhelped to locate 12,746 of the children, a recovery rate of about 85 <br/>\npercent.<br/>\n<br/>\nExecutive Director Ben Ermini said the center is not an investigative <br/>\nor research agency. It routinely collects information on abducted <br/>\nchildren, including personal characteristics, family members, and <br/>\nwhere the child was taken from and eventually found.<br/>\n<br/>\nDetails in the center&#39;s recovery reports might mention that a child <br/>\nwas home-schooled if that was volunteered by another agency that <br/>\nconducted the investigation, Ermini said.<br/>\n<br/>\n``We just don&#39;t track that type of information. We don&#39;t ask the <br/>\nquestion of families or the law enforcement agencies that locate <br/>\nthese children,&#39;&#39; he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nCases counted<br/>\n<br/>\nResponding to a Beacon Journal request, the national center <br/>\nidentified 13 cases involving 18 recovered children since 1990 in <br/>\nwhich the family was home schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n``That doesn&#39;t mean that there weren&#39;t hundreds of other kids that <br/>\nwere recovered that were home-schooled, but they never mentioned it <br/>\nin the report,&#39;&#39; Ermini said.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn its research of a shorter period of time, the Beacon Journal found <br/>\n18 more cases that the national center did not identify -- involving <br/>\n28 abducted children -- in which home schooling reportedly was <br/>\noccurring. The newspaper reviewed thousands of articles published <br/>\nsince 1997.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s probable that the Beacon Journal&#39;s research is incomplete. <br/>\nAbductions and reunions aren&#39;t always the subject of news coverage. <br/>\nAlso, newspapers and other publications don&#39;t always note whether a <br/>\nchild was home-schooled while in hiding.<br/>\n<br/>\nCall for regulation<br/>\n<br/>\nThe executive director of Vanished Children&#39;s Alliance, a California-<br/>\nbased agency that is the nation&#39;s oldest and second-largest <br/>\norganization dedicated to finding missing children, said an abducting <br/>\nparent would be motivated to keep the child out of schools and away <br/>\nfrom other children and adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeorgia K. Hilgeman-Hammond said law enforcement agencies should be <br/>\ncollecting data on abducting parents, including whether they use home <br/>\nschooling to elude authorities.<br/>\n<br/>\n``This is a way to keep the child out of the mainstream,&#39;&#39; she said.<br/>\n<br/>\nHilgeman-Hammond thinks state and federal lawmakers should hold <br/>\nparents more accountable by requiring them to notify their local <br/>\ndistricts that they are home schooling and to provide prior academic <br/>\nrecords.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Beacon Journal also found cases in which the national center was <br/>\ninvolved in helping to find the abducted child but had not determined <br/>\nthe child was home-schooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn one such case, Melissa Ann Gooding was caught in Corinth, Texas, <br/>\nin 2002 after the national center&#39;s routine request for an update on <br/>\nthe case prompted the Adams County, Ill., sheriff to renew the search <br/>\nfor the mother and her daughter, Lisa.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had disappeared in 1990, about the time Lisa Gooding&#39;s father in <br/>\nIllinois was awarded custody. Melissa Ann Gooding lived in several <br/>\nstates; among them were Illinois and Texas, where no registration for <br/>\nhome schooling is required.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Texas, home schooling is so common that most people don&#39;t think <br/>\ntwice about a home-schooling family living nearby.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdams County Deputy Clay Doan tracked Melissa Ann Gooding&#39;s parents <br/>\nand sister to the outskirts of Corinth, where a game warden, who <br/>\nregularly set traps for snakes and bobcats near the home, helped <br/>\nidentify the family -- including the missing mother and daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoan said that Lisa Gooding was home-schooled and her mother had <br/>\nnever told her that she was abducted.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoan, who followed the girl&#39;s progress through the court proceedings <br/>\nand afterward, said she was several grades behind for her age when <br/>\nshe was placed in a public school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mother was convicted of a felony and granted supervised <br/>\nvisitation, Doan said.<br/>\n<br/>\nGirl found in Streetsboro<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike the national center, the FBI or the Department of Justice, <br/>\nDeborah Aylward considers home schooling in her searches. As a <br/>\nprivate investigator, she knows it offers a way to hide children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAylward heads Home Fires, a group from Virginia that offers legal and <br/>\ninvestigative services to parents looking for lost children.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a cold afternoon in February 2002, Aylward sat outside a home in <br/>\nStreetsboro, waiting for local police to arrive. Minutes earlier, she <br/>\nhad witnessed a young girl in a dress walk quickly from a car to the <br/>\nhome, a coat pulled over her head.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor three weeks, Aylward had been tracking Gail Perkins, a 6-year-old <br/>\nabducted by her father five years earlier from her home in <br/>\nGreensboro, N.C.<br/>\n<br/>\nGail&#39;s mother, Nikki Jones, had turned to Aylward and Home Fires <br/>\nafter the FBI, the national center and four private investigators <br/>\nwere unable to locate the girl.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the police arrived at the Streetsboro home, they found Gail and <br/>\nher grandmother hiding in a bedroom closet.<br/>\n<br/>\nStreetsboro police said that Gail wasn&#39;t enrolled in school and that <br/>\nthe family said she was home-schooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nAylward said she found Gail by focusing on the extended family of her <br/>\nfather, Adam Perkins.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor five years, as they moved from state to state, Gail had been told <br/>\nthat her grandmother was her mother. Law enforcement officials <br/>\nbelieve the family was in southern Virginia before moving to <br/>\nStreetsboro.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvasion and tracking<br/>\n<br/>\n``It&#39;s very hard to disappear in the United States today,&#39;&#39; Aylward <br/>\nsaid.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said someone in hiding must stop using a Social Security number <br/>\nand credit for purchases. The person needs to find work that pays <br/>\nunder the table, use a post office box instead of a mailing address <br/>\nand register vehicles in someone else&#39;s name.<br/>\n<br/>\n``School is a major issue,&#39;&#39; Aylward said.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn her experience, many abducting parents either home-school or <br/>\nenroll the children in an obscure religious school that doesn&#39;t ask <br/>\nfor student records, she said.<br/>\n<br/>\n``In most of the cases I have handled over the past 10 years, home <br/>\nschooling has been a factor,&#39;&#39; Aylward said, adding she has handled <br/>\nabout 75 cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone is caught with a child, they say as a defense that they <br/>\nare home schooling, she said. ``It&#39;s a great cover. `I&#39;m home <br/>\nschooling my kids.&#39; &#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, she said, home schooling is often only a cover.<br/>\n<br/>\n``They are living a fugitive lifestyle. Schooling is not high on <br/>\ntheir list,&#39;&#39; Aylward said. ``They&#39;re protecting their own butts from <br/>\nprosecution and how they can lay low. I don&#39;t think there is home <br/>\nschooling at all. I don&#39;t think these children are schooled <br/>\nwhatsoever.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe thinks legitimate home-schooling families should be concerned <br/>\nthat these parents are tainting the movement&#39;s reputation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same laws that empower a parent to home-school can provide cover <br/>\nto abducting parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n``It&#39;s a loophole in the whole mess,&#39;&#39; Aylward said. ``Home schooling <br/>\nshould not be looked at as a method of harboring abducted children.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe estimated that abductor families truly were home schooling in <br/>\nabout 10 percent of the cases she has investigated.<br/>\n<br/>\n``It&#39;s a great way to deflect attention about why children are home <br/>\nall day and not going to school. Who is going to call first? It&#39;s the <br/>\nnosy old lady on the street who is going to say, `These kids aren&#39;t <br/>\nin school,&#39; &#39;&#39; she said.<br/>\n<br/>\n``If I were a parent and I moved into a neighborhood, it&#39;s like being <br/>\nin the witness-protection program. I would make friends with <br/>\neverybody, introduce my kids under an alias and say they were being <br/>\nhome-schooled, and that would be it,&#39;&#39; Aylward said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;Out of the sunlight&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda Shay Gardner, a Bethlehem, Pa., lawyer who specializes in <br/>\nabduction cases and sits on the board of The Committee for Missing <br/>\nChildren, said no data exist on the link between home schooling and <br/>\nmissing children, but she has encountered the problem in her efforts <br/>\nto reunite children with custodial parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n``They are home schooling to keep them out of the sunlight. I have <br/>\nseen it in cases,&#39;&#39; she said.<br/>\n<br/>\nGardner said states with laws like Ohio&#39;s make it almost impossible <br/>\nto track a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents are not going to be able to call the more than 600 school <br/>\ndistricts in Ohio, Gardner said. ``Even the national center isn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to spend the time to call (all those) school districts.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that is just one state.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany abductors move their children from state to state.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy Hammer, director of the international division and policy <br/>\ncounsel at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, <br/>\nsaid an abducting parent&#39;s claiming to be home schooling makes sense, <br/>\nbut her experience has been that little or no education is taking <br/>\nplace.<br/>\n<br/>\n``Why would anybody bother to register, even in Ohio, that they are <br/>\nhome schooling if they abducted their child?&#39;&#39; she said. ``I would <br/>\njust wait and see if anybody asked me, and then if I got caught, I&#39;d <br/>\nsay I didn&#39;t know I was supposed to register.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nHammer said the issue raises a number of questions that lack easy <br/>\nanswers, such as: Do relaxed rules for home schooling create an <br/>\nenvironment that leads to an increase in abductions? Would an <br/>\nabducting parent who already has violated laws by taking the child be <br/>\nconcerned about following home-schooling registration laws?<br/>\n<br/>\nSchooling missed<br/>\n<br/>\nThe search for a missing child is, as Rodney Fritts said, like <br/>\nlooking for a needle in a haystack.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor eight years, he and a team of investigators could not break the <br/>\ncase and find his daughter and her mother. Finally, in 2002, he went <br/>\non The Montel Williams Show. Afterward, someone in Montana spotted <br/>\nhis ex-wife, he said, and shortly thereafter they showed up at <br/>\nFritts&#39; back door.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Outlaw Fritts was convicted of a misdemeanor and fined $250. The <br/>\nsame judge recently issued a warrant for her arrest for failure to <br/>\nprovide child support, Rodney Fritts said.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe learned that for eight years, his daughter had never attended <br/>\nconventional private or public schools. Instead, she was home-<br/>\nschooled or attended small religious schools run by a network of <br/>\nparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Emily came home at age 15,Rodney Fritts offered her a choice of <br/>\nschool settings. She opted to enroll in Stuarts Draft High School, a <br/>\npublic school, as a freshman.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily should have been a sophomore, but she had no high school <br/>\ncredits.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe went to summer school, took extra courses and will graduate on <br/>\ntime in June 2005, with plans to go to college next fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nRodney Fritts said their relationship was strained at first, but a <br/>\nfew months ago, Emily&#39;s attitude suddenly changed, and now she is <br/>\nhappy, positive and excited about school.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily, now 18, has also become a standout long-distance runner on the <br/>\nhigh school cross country and indoor and outdoor track teams.<br/>\n<br/>\n``She&#39;s got three letters in three different sports,&#39;&#39; Rodney Fritts <br/>\nsaid. ``She couldn&#39;texcel in anything before without the threat of <br/>\nbeing found.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nComing Friday: The politics of home schooling.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101225,"nextTopicId":101211}}
