Her <br/>\n  husband had never even *changed a diaper*. From what I&#39;ve read, it was all <br/>\n  about him, and what he wanted.  I know that when my three (only three!) kids <br/>\n  were little I felt like there was nothing I could do well.  That gets better <br/>\n  with time, but this woman had NO BREAKS.  Don&#39;t get me started...<br/>\n  Troy<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;The hormones that were causing post partum depression could have been<br/>\n  &gt;cured.  There are homeopathic remedies that treat people with post<br/>\n  &gt;partum depression and even remedies that treat people who feel that<br/>\n  &gt;there is something wrong with their children so they should kill<br/>\n  &gt;them.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Sheila<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
