On the lighter side.........<br/>\nBetty<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf  you&#39;re a bear, you get to hibernate. <br/>\nYou do nothing but sleep for six months. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could deal with that. <br/>\n <br/>\nBefore you hibernate, you&#39;re supposed to eat yourself <br/>\nstupid. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could deal with that, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re a bear, you birth your children (who are the size <br/>\nof walnuts) while you&#39;re sleeping and wake to partially <br/>\ngrown, cute cuddly cubs. <br/>\n <br/>\nI could definitely deal with that. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re a mama bear, everyone knows you mean business. <br/>\nYou swat anyone who bothers your cubs. If your cubs get <br/>\nout of line, you swat them too. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could deal with that. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re a bear, your mate EXPECTS you to wake up <br/>\ngrowling. He EXPECTS that you will have hairy legs and <br/>\nexcess body fat. <br/>\n <br/>\nYup..... I wanna be a bear. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36784,"nextTopicId":36817}}
