If you do join a project group, you<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to do everything that the group offers.  Here a project is<br/>\ndefined as 6 learning activities and a community service activity.  I run<br/>\nthe rabbit project and offer 6 meetings with different topics.  Kids can be<br/>\ninvolved in the project and simply not complete it if they don&#39;t do all six<br/>\nmeetings OR they can do some of the meetings and do other things, like talk<br/>\nto breeders, do a rabbit judging contest, etc., to make out 6 learning<br/>\nactivities and complete the project that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 4-H, very little is MANDATORY.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45425,"nextTopicId":45435}}
