I<br/>\nhave a few things to say.  I don&#39;t know if any of the things I am going<br/>\nto say are actually at odds with much in the previous post.

Drugs didn&#39;t agree with me...except alcohol which I<br/>\nabsolutely loved at first drink. That being said......<br/>\n<br/>\nThe search for altered states of consciousness has been a human<br/>\nendeavour for as far back as one can look.  This occurs in both sacred<br/>\nand secular contexts.<br/>\n<br/>\nHumans are experimenting creatures.  There are definitely dangers<br/>\nassociated with this proclivity.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people who experiment with drugs (in the broadest definition of<br/>\ndrugs e.g. nicotine, caffeine, alcohol,) do not become addicted.  Of all<br/>\nof the available drugs nicotine is the most addictive and dangerous in<br/>\nterms of health consequences.  Alcohol would come second.  &quot;Hard&quot; drugs<br/>\ndo not come close to destroying as many lives as nicotine and alcohol.<br/>\n<br/>\nInhalants are very dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people who are addicted to substances have multiple problems of<br/>\nwhich addiction is one.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost addicted people recover from their addictions on their own without<br/>\nprofessional assistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAddicted individuals who are unable to deal with their addictions are<br/>\noften people who have histories of physical, mental, emotional, and/ or<br/>\nsexual abuse which contributes to their addiction problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are strong puritanical, anti-pleasure, Calvinistic currents within<br/>\nsome of the anti-drug thinking that currently holds sway with many<br/>\npeople.  This confuses the issue and makes it difficult to educate<br/>\npeople as to the real dangers of drugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion the Multinational Drug Cartel (which has two branches i.e.<br/>\nlegal [pharmaceutical] and illegal) and the Multinational Criminal<br/>\nJustice Industry are partners in crime.  There is collusion with the<br/>\nMedical, psychiatric, &quot;health&quot; industry in addition to the Media related<br/>\nindustry.  And of course the Education Industry is a beneficiary of our<br/>\nabsurd public policy.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally people who come from intact, functional families (not a huge<br/>\nnumber) don&#39;t have major drug problems.  Of course many people who come<br/>\nfrom grossly dysfunctional families don&#39;t think that they do because<br/>\nmystification is a common phenomena in dysfunctional families.  Combine<br/>\nthat with the dysfunctional nature of many of our &quot;normal&quot; values and<br/>\nyou have most people thinking such things as: war is a necessary evil,<br/>\nthere are always going to be rich and poor people, you can&#39;t fight city<br/>\nhall and an endless list of platitudes which are the basis for the<br/>\nalmost slave like mentality of the majority.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe war on drugs has militarized the police, destroyed entire<br/>\ncommunities, enriched the prison industry, discarded fundamental civil<br/>\nliberties and rights, spread drug use around the world, maintained<br/>\nartificially high prices and corrupted most police agencies.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrug use is a public health problem to the extent that it is a problem.<br/>\nThe criminalization of &quot;bad&quot; drugs has marginalized entire segments of<br/>\nthe population.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe chaos generated by our irrational (in relation to the public<br/>\ninterest, perfectly rational from the above mentioned cartel&#39;s<br/>\ninterests) policy has harmed millions.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren have been lied to about the nature of drugs, drug use,<br/>\naddiction in the same ways they have been lied to about the nature of<br/>\nlearning, education, and things as basic as &quot;feelings&quot;.

Realistic. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor some reason, drug safety hit me when I first read your post.  So, I<br/>\njust wanted to rattle off some thoughts on that issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to mention some pointers that saved me in ADULT situations<br/>\nlater in life, as well as younger years, if I may.  My father was a police<br/>\nofficer.  He took every opportunity to warn us of dangers of drugs.  Many<br/>\ndangers, for that matter, that stayed with me.  As a child I often pondered<br/>\nwhy he repeated these warnings at EVERY opportunity.  &quot;I know, I know&quot;, I&#39;d<br/>\nthink.  But you know what, this is the one area, where repetitiveness<br/>\nreally pays off!  To this day, I will NEVER cross over a rail road with the<br/>\nbars down.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor one thing, please consider teaching them to NEVER go back to food or<br/>\ndrink they have turned from.  No matter how &quot;close&quot; their friends.  My<br/>\nfather drilled this into me.  I never forgot, years later, my father&#39;s<br/>\nwords resounding in my ears as the news reported a five year old little<br/>\ngirl on an acid trip, because someone at school put it in her milk, when<br/>\nshe wasn&#39;t looking.  And the report explained how she could have those<br/>\nrecurring trips for the rest of her life!<br/>\n<br/>\nLook to channels such as The History Cannel and The Learning Channel (both<br/>\nonline.  Our son abhors smoking.  But thanks to an old TV show, he saw the<br/>\nold &quot;glamour&quot; stand, and imitated it as I myself did at his age.  While he<br/>\nis only 7, I still took advantage of a recent documentary.  One of the<br/>\nthree part episodes, we recorded and played.  It showed a woman with a<br/>\ntrach, and a man frail and dying, etc.  It had a major impact!  These<br/>\ndocumentaries on drugs can be fantastic (but you may want to record them,<br/>\nand be sure it is what your looking for). <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may seem even more paranoid, and you may have already taught them this,<br/>\nbut they should be very leery of anything their friends give them. <br/>\nParticularly at party settings.  I had a VERY VERY close friend tell me he<br/>\nput &quot;nothing&quot; in the brownies.  Well, those ol&#39; Barney Miller runs ran<br/>\nthrough my head, and something went off in me.  It turned out that he lied<br/>\nto me, and another friend (knowing I did not do drugs) told me that he&#39;d<br/>\nput pot or hash in them.  This is where my father&#39;s words really came to<br/>\nlife!<br/>\n<br/>\nYoung children should not even lick &quot;stamps&quot; that other children give them<br/>\n(teach &#39;em to use a sponge).  I know, I&#39;m sounding paranoid (I live in NY -<br/>\nLOL).  But it is true.  They are lacing stamps with drugs now!  It hooks<br/>\nthe children and they don&#39;t realize why, and come back for more.  They<br/>\ngradually increase it, till they are hooked.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn last drug problem, that many of us forget (one I have not brought to my<br/>\nson&#39;s attention yet), &quot;snuffing&quot;.  I read in a Reader&#39;s Digest article,<br/>\nabout a boy who was homeschooled until his teen years.  :When he went to<br/>\nschool, he was introduced to it.  The parents had no clue what was<br/>\nhappening.  The boy was found dead in his bathtub.  Snuffing is the<br/>\npractice of sniffing glue and whip cream aerosols (being the two most<br/>\ncommon aerosols), markers, etc.  You would be surprised how many products<br/>\nin the home are &quot;snuff&quot; products.  Most children don&#39;t realize how<br/>\ndangerous this is.  It doesn&#39;t occur to them it is a drug.  Many children<br/>\ndie on the first &quot;snuff&quot; experience.  Children (and many adults) don&#39;t<br/>\nrealize how dangerous this is. <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, look around.  Aside from the history and learning channels, life is<br/>\na great lesson in this.  Look in the library for documentaries on drug<br/>\nrehab.  Watching folks coming off drugs is a great lesson.  And watching a<br/>\nchild is an even greater lesson!  Especially the babies born to it.  These<br/>\ndocumentaries can be chilling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, a local drug rehab center may offer pamphlets and information.  A<br/>\nvisit / &quot;filed trip&quot; may be valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I recently took myself off a medication (I hadn&#39;t taken<br/>\nprescription drugs in years!) that I was told was &quot;non-addictive&quot; (as my<br/>\npharmacist put it, any drug is potentially addictive).  I suffered from<br/>\nhorrific violent vomiting, shakes and sweats for two weeks!   I used this<br/>\nopportunity to show my son that this was from a drug a doctor gave me, and<br/>\nthat drugs that are not from doctors are even worse!  Every day, as I went<br/>\nthrough this, I reminded him.  If my experience was to save him in later<br/>\nlife, I am thankful for it.  (Don&#39;t do this to yourself on purpose, however<br/>\n- LOL.  I&#39;m just saying that it was an opportunity, and it had an impact.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome might say that you don&#39;t need these impacts to teach your children. <br/>\nMaybe not.  I know they saved me, especially as I got older, as did my<br/>\nfaith in the Lord.  And, when it comes to drugs, the harsh reality is that<br/>\nthey are a harsh, frightening reality, with an impact.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope at least some of this is useful.
