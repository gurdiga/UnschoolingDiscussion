Holly has a friend who&#39;s the most religious person in her family of five.  <br/>\nThe mom is my friend, and she&#39;s the least religious of the five, which is all <br/>\nvery interesting in itself. &lt;g&gt;  The friend indicated that her dad didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant her listening to a certain song, so I turned off the radio.

Do you believe anything?  If you do, you could share that<br/>\nwith them too.  I have come to realize over the years, that you can be a<br/>\nspiritual person without being a religious person.  I took my kids to a very<br/>\nopen accepting small church for a few years because I felt some sense of<br/>\nduty to do it. (I am glad I was able to let that go.) They liked it while I<br/>\ntaught the religious ed,  but when I had had my fill of that,  they decided<br/>\nthey didn&#39;t want to go anymore, so we stopped.  My kids went to Awana with<br/>\nsome friends for a while and it made me really uncomfortable.  I was there<br/>\nwith them when they explained to them (around Halloween) how witches are<br/>\nreal and you could have someone who is a witch living right beside you, how<br/>\na witch is a worker of the devil etc.  It was scare tactics to get them to<br/>\nbelieve what that church believes and that started some interesting<br/>\nconversations between us but it made me very uncomfortable.  They went as<br/>\nlong as they wanted to but when they started to want to stay home, I didn&#39;t<br/>\npush it.  I was glad that they stopped.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI taught my kids to pray (their own words, mostly thankful prayer) because I<br/>\nfeel prayer helps me to focus on the positive in my day.  They enjoy the<br/>\nritual of prayer before bed.  They know that different people believe<br/>\ndifferent things and if they want to explore different religions one day,<br/>\nI&#39;ll help them to do that.  When I was finally able to let go of the guilt<br/>\nof not going to church, it felt so good, so freeing. If you had asked me if<br/>\nI went because I felt a sense of duty, I might have said no, but it was<br/>\nthere, beneath the surface somewhere.  I don&#39;t believe that God, in all his<br/>\npower, could be a jealous or angry  or vengeful god who would be angry if<br/>\nyou missed Sunday service.
