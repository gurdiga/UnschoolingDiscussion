My son was 8 when we read it and we both decided to read it only in the daylight! I began reading HP to him but I got hooked as well--sometimes I&#39;d continue to read after he fell asleep at night and then have to back track for him the next day. We&#39;ve read all 4 books and listened to 1 and 2 on audio as well. We are very impatiently waiting for #5 to come out. We saw the movie and thought it was well-done, but of course, much was left out so that was a disappointment. We don&#39;t (so far) have any of the &quot;stuff,&quot; though ds will be getting some Lego/HP items for Christmas. The children have their own money, which they are free to use on HP if they wish but so far the Legos are the only thing creating an interest here.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Joan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"groundhoggirl","from":"groundhoggirl &lt;groundhoggirl@...&gt;","profile":"groundhoggirl2","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"upLUe8dcakF8iY8v7G4bK3I4Bgp1Ej7vQq8KztbbIKg3q6ySQYU79ZZZGXlbT_5i68cTgE6Z4sc8Q4K3yrja-u54EG_sPEsoqCRN00ExvFkFINo","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Harry Potter Mania","postDate":"1006801264","msgId":28594,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYwRTE0OTJDLUUyOUYtMTFENS04MDEwLTAwMDM5MzQ5RDRBRUBob3VzdG9uLnJyLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDExMTI2MTM0ODQyMDI5MC4wMEEyRDZBRkBtYWlsLjE4MDAtd29yay1mcm9tLWhvbWUuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28592,"nextInTopic":28597,"prevInTime":28593,"nextInTime":28595,"topicId":28592,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We all went and saw the movie on Thanksgiving Day as a special treat.
