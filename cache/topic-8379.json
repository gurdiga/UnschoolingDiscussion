We have a Barnes &<br/>\nNoble nearby, so I guess we will be stopping there today to see if they<br/>\nhave it.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I also just found the Scientific American Explorations magazine site<br/>\nand it looks good too. Here it is:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.explorations.org/index.html\">http://www.explorations.org/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll look for that one also at B&N. No wonder I can spend so much time and<br/>\nmoney at bookstores!

The first one is Science At Home.<br/>\n&gt;They have a web site but I could find no phone #.<br/>\n&gt;scienceathome.com  <br/>\n&gt;the second mag is Scientific American Explorations<br/>\n&gt;phone # to order is 1-800-333-1199 <br/>\n&gt;Scientific American does have a web site but I do not<br/>\n&gt;have the url. You could search it out though. Hope<br/>\n&gt;this helps. Both mags look great, lots of hands on. <br/>\n&gt;Good luck!<br/>\n&gt;Jill </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8267,"nextTopicId":8384}}
