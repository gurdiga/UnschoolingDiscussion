Holly (12) has an artsy (but awkward) <br/>\ncursive.  Marty (14, and a lefty) prints very small.   Small printing is very <br/>\nuseful, and some professionals learn it later in life, or used to, anyway <br/>\n(architects, cartoonists, cartographers).  In school they teach people to write the <br/>\nsame size because of pre-lined paper, and for filling-in-blanks purposes.  Few <br/>\nadults write on pre-lined paper, and blanks are increasingly filled in &quot;print <br/>\nonly&quot; (next time you fill in public forms, see if they don&#39;t ask you to print, <br/>\nand maybe in spaced designed for transferring it to data entry!).<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of weeks ago, I saw Kirby (17) fill in blanks by hand, quickly.  He <br/>\nwas judging karate belt tests, just him and the sensei of the dojo where he <br/>\ngoes.  He prints, but I guess it was acceptable.  He&#39;s been doing that for a few <br/>\nyears.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here&#39;s what about that:  They don&#39;t mind writing.  They don&#39;t fear it.  <br/>\nWhen they need it they use it, and they usually use the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found a sample of Marty-writing in the trash yesterday, and knowing he had <br/>\nused my computer to write the day before, I did a Sherlock search to see how <br/>\nthe final copy had turned out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a character description with stats and lists of previous projects (of <br/>\nthe character).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome words were misspelled by hand, but corrected on the computer.  He had <br/>\nrun spell check.  It didn&#39;t catch &quot;fallow&quot; because it&#39;s a real word.  He meant <br/>\n&quot;follow.&quot;  So I told him what &quot;fallow&quot; meant, and now he knows two words and <br/>\ntheir spellings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe misspellings he corrected were<br/>\naproched<br/>\nofferd<br/>\nspoted<br/>\n<br/>\nSome words he spelled correctly were<br/>\nprevious<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t<br/>\njoined<br/>\naced<br/>\nevery<br/>\nsomething<br/>\n<br/>\nHe needs punctuation help.  Sometime when we&#39;re the only two in the room, <br/>\nI&#39;ll show him a couple of ways to know when to use a comma, if he&#39;s in the mood.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut...<br/>\nI could read it all (even though it was only written for Marty&#39;s own use), <br/>\nand it&#39;s interesting!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo although I know the topic was handwriting, not writing in general, I think <br/>\nmaking a six year old (or eight, or nine) practice writing is more likely to <br/>\nmake him dislike it than like it.

A couple years ago we talked about<br/>\nlearning to type instead and I picked up a couple of kid-oriented typing<br/>\nprograms.  He tried them out once or twice.  What eventually motivated him<br/>\nwas having a real interest ... a true need to learn to type.  For him that<br/>\nneed was getting into online gaming.  After two weeks playing online he was<br/>\na very proficient typist.  In fact, even he remarked that he was surprised<br/>\nhow quickly he picked up the skill once he had a true reason to learn it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes your son have a reason he wants to learn to type .. .other than just<br/>\nbecause he &quot;hates&quot; writing?  You can pick him up a typing program or two to<br/>\ntry out, but don&#39;t be surprised if they don&#39;t hold his attention on their<br/>\nown.  A real reason will do so much more than any fancy piece of software to<br/>\nmotivate him to learn to type.  When he&#39;s got a real reason, he can just<br/>\nstart typing!  I guarantee he&#39;ll get faster with experience.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays I don&#39;t think my son - he&#39;s 12 now - harbours a &quot;hatred&quot; of writing<br/>\n(something he developed in school), it&#39;s just not his communication method<br/>\nof choice.

I am a 39yo mother to 3 <br/>\nwonderful children, a soon-to-be 13yo boy, a 7yo girl, and a 4yo <br/>\nboy. My oldest went to a catholic school for K-5th grade, and my <br/>\ndaughter went part-time to a Lutheran pre-school, and the same <br/>\ncatholic school as my son for some pre-school. I <br/>\nstarted &quot;researching&quot; homeschooling before my son finished fifth <br/>\ngrade, and moved into unschooling as quickly as I could learn about <br/>\nit. All throughout this time, and for the last 15 years, I have been <br/>\nworking as an occupational therapist (full- or part-time) in the <br/>\npublic schools and early intervention programs.<br/>\n<br/>\nA common part of my work is helping children with &quot;handwriting <br/>\nissues&quot;. It has always bothered me that teachers wanted little kids <br/>\nto hold their pencils &quot;properly&quot;, when they have not finished <br/>\ndeveloping their fine motor skills yet. Many kids fine motor skills <br/>\nare not fully refined until age 8, some even later! Yet now, kids in <br/>\npre-K have to learn to write their name to be &quot;ready&quot; for <br/>\nkindergarten, and kindergarteners are writing alot more than that. <br/>\nIt&#39;s so wrong, and I tell all the teachers of students I&#39;m asked to <br/>\nwork with. They&#39;ll agree, but they are being asked to produce <br/>\nresults too, just like teachers at higher grades with testing. With <br/>\nsome of the older children I work with, the focus is on functional <br/>\nwriting. Can the child write legibly? If not, we look to other <br/>\noptions, like portable word processors, or the computers in the <br/>\nclassrooms, or notetakers,etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I can get really carried away, but the main point I wanted to <br/>\nstress is don&#39;t stress about pencil grip or handwriting. Let your <br/>\nchild lead the way, as in all things. If s/he wants to write, and is <br/>\nhaving difficulty, there are a multitude of options out there to <br/>\ntry.  Different pens, pencils, grips, papers, etc. Also, writing can <br/>\nbe done is so many mediums, like art (sand, clay, paint, beads, <br/>\netc.) And there&#39;s always typing!<br/>\n<br/>\nDeanne</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1694471,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","profile":"anoydami","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Handwriting","postDate":"1019681599","msgId":35922,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxYjcwMWMxZWJkYSQxMGRiNzQyMCQ1YzVkZDFkMUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGFhNjljays1czlqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35799,"nextInTopic":96129,"prevInTime":35921,"nextInTime":35923,"topicId":1847,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, all I know is that it was fun and s makes a great swan and p makes a great pound puppy  Lynda ...

Don&#39;t make a big fuss about handwriting. If and when<br/>\n&gt;there is a need for good handwriting, the unschooler will find a way to<br/>\n&gt;improve the way he or she writes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The thoughts that come from the hand of my 17 year old brother are never<br/>\n&gt;weak, even though his handwriting has more in common with some ancient,<br/>\n&gt;indecipherable and long gone language. His handwriting is poor enough that<br/>\n&gt;he he knows it is hard for others to read his handwriting--but not such a<br/>\n&gt;hinderance that he feels that he must improve. His solution is to use a<br/>\n&gt;computer for most of his public writing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For my own part, I had very poor handwriting until I started a daily<br/>\n&gt;journal. I was a new 14 at the time. Writing in the journal cleaned up my<br/>\n&gt;scribbles in short order. My handwriting was perfectly legible by journal #2<br/>\n&gt;or 3, I think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The journal also helped me to learn cursive. Until age 16, I didn&#39;t need<br/>\n&gt;cursive. Once a need arose, though, I decided to use cursive exclusively in<br/>\n&gt;my journal. The first few weeks were rough. Each day, cursive chart in hand,<br/>\n&gt;I would labor over my journal for 45 minutes to an hour. The pace was very<br/>\n&gt;slow, but after a month my cursive was better than most of my friends.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was 17 when I finally picked up cursive.
