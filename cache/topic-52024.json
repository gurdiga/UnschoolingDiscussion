Example:  Our dogs are<br/>\nherding breeds.  The instinct that drives herding behavior is hunting and<br/>\nkilling sheep and goats.  Without training, our dogs might well attack the<br/>\ngoats.  I have bought books and videos and have started training them as<br/>\nstock dogs.  It involves me working with the dog on a long lead in the goat<br/>\npen.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould your dog not be trained to retrieve rather than kill?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51802,"nextTopicId":51992}}
