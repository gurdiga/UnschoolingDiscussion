Granted <br/>\nI didn&#39;t pay that much attention but I caught enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure why anyone would want to participate in what seems to be a very <br/>\nhurtful show.  The participants don&#39;t look happy and it certainly doesn&#39;t look <br/>\nlike fun.  But then again, why do they complain and fight?  They choose to be <br/>\non this show, right?  It&#39;s not like some agency came in a snatched you out of <br/>\nyour life and stuck you in another.  It&#39;s only 2 weeks!!!  Each week, the <br/>\ntable is turned.  I can&#39;t imagine that it would be so hard for 2 short weeks.  <br/>\nEspecially if you chose to do it.  If it was for months or something, THAT would <br/>\nbe hard.  I guess I don&#39;t get it.  Like Survivor and similar, I can imagine <br/>\nhow hard it could be.  But I don&#39;t understand the tears and &quot;I just want to go <br/>\nhome&quot;.  Why sign up?  It&#39;s not like you were forced to do it against your <br/>\nwill.  Must just be for ratings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t imagine being away for 2 weeks.  I would never want my kids to <br/>\nparticipate in it.  That&#39;s what bothered me the most.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>\nhealthy.
