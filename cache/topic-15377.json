It is changing, slowly.  Sometimes <br/>\nthere will be one step back.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Holly asks me &quot;what do I say if people ask what religion I am?&quot;  I say <br/>\n&quot;Why do they want to know?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the answer IS &quot;Christian&quot; for us.  If the person asking is Jewish, <br/>\nor Moslem, we&#39;re Christian.  If someone from Madagascar asks where I live, I <br/>\nlive in the U.S.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone who&#39;s Christian is asking, we&#39;re agnostic.  If their purpose is to <br/>\nknow what denomination, we are none.  That&#39;s like someone in Albuquerque <br/>\nasking where I live.  I live near Juan Tabo and Candelaria.  It&#39;s relative to <br/>\ntheir position, and the information they need. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf their purpose is to ask whether we&#39;re born again so they know whether to <br/>\nproselytize or not, we&#39;re agnostic.  But if the question is what is your <br/>\nfamily, culturally and historically, then in that context we&#39;re Christian.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15362,"nextTopicId":15170}}
