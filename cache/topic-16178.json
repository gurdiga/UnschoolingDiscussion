She would do or say anything that he wanted to get <br/>\nout of that situation alive and to prevent me from watching her get <br/>\nshot.  This is not a scene from a movie or a dramatized portrayal of <br/>\nreality, this actually happened.  My mother lied, &quot;Yes, I love you <br/>\nand only you.  I will do anything for you.  You are a wonderful <br/>\nhusband and father&quot;  She would do ANYTHING to keep from getting <br/>\nshot.  Did she set a bad example for me?  Or did she save her own <br/>\nlife?

Jim and <br/>\nI were playing cards at their house one night and we were all <br/>\ndrinking, having a good, but competitive time (spades, men <br/>\nvs.women).  An argument broke out between her and her husband and <br/>\nthings got out of control very quickly.  Her husband, too, was a <br/>\nhunter and had a rifle.  Right in front of us, he went and got his <br/>\nshotgun and pointed it at her.  I do not know if it was loaded, but <br/>\nall of us would have said or done anything to have him put that gun <br/>\naway!<br/>\n<br/>\nLast but not least, when Jim & I were teenagers we went to a quarry <br/>\nwith a big group of our friends and had a bonfire and a party that <br/>\nnight.  Two teenage guys that we didn&#39;t know came out of the woodsy <br/>\narea and right up to us wondering what we were doing there.  One was <br/>\ncarrying a shotgun and the other an ax or hatchet.  They certainly <br/>\ndidn&#39;t look friendly, and we were on their &quot;turf&quot;.  Here we are, very <br/>\nsuburban, &quot;whitebread&quot; teenagers staring at two &quot;gang&quot; members.  So, <br/>\none of our very outspoken friends stood up, apologized for us <br/>\nintruding, offered for all of us to leave, then offered a beer, and, <br/>\nultimately, diffused the situation.
