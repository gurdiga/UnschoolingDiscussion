She&#39;s had it since birth.  When she was little we would  <br/>\nalways run in when she screamed, expecting something HORRIBLE to be  <br/>\nhappening.  We didn&#39;t want to tell her &quot;never scream,&quot; because if  <br/>\nshe&#39;s being attacked or abducted, that scream by itself could save  <br/>\nher, and because it was SO effective getting attention, we had to ask  <br/>\nher to limit it to REAL emergencies.  We said &quot;If someone&#39;s hurt  <br/>\nbadly, or bleeding, scream.&quot;  But we would say &quot;not cool&quot; about  <br/>\nscreams involving frustration about another child not giving her a  <br/>\ntoy, or anything like just screaming for fun on the swingset.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom had a policy that if someone tattled and the other kid got a  <br/>\nspanking, the tattler got one swat for tattling.  It didn&#39;t last  <br/>\nlong, because we talked to her and said that wasn&#39;t fair.   You might  <br/>\nthink &quot;duh!&quot; but she had grown to adulthood having not tattled on her  <br/>\nbrother who raped her and the died of a fever not long after, and it  <br/>\nwarped her view of the virtue of not tattling, I think.   We were  <br/>\nalso being punished for disturbing her from whatever she was doing  <br/>\nand having to deal with children.  None of that showed much compassion.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":138887996,"authorName":"deyoung@maxnet.co.nz","from":"deyoung@...","profile":"mrsdebus","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Digest Number 5722","postDate":"1141065750","msgId":112471,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NTUuMjEwLjU1LjEwNi40OS4xMTQxMDY1NzUwLnNxdWlycmVsQHdlYm1haWwubWF4bmV0LmNvLm56Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExNDEwNTk0NjAuMjI2LjgwNjU2Lm0xN0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDExNDEwNTk0NjAuMjI2LjgwNjU2Lm0xN0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":112472,"prevInTime":112470,"nextInTime":112472,"topicId":112471,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi there ...
