Obviously Christian means more than that,<br/>\nbut it&#39;s a broad religion encompassing a fair slew of beliefs and practices<br/>\ncentered around Jesus Christ.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut fundamentalist Christians of the most conservative type, identify their<br/>\nnarrow practice of Christianity as Christian. Period. No one is Christian<br/>\nregardless of what you call yourselves. Not Lutherans. Not Episcopalians.<br/>\nAnd very most definitely not Mormons or Catholics.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;d be pointless to argue whether the spread of this movement is truth or<br/>\npolitics, but, regardless, it has a powerful political component. There are<br/>\nmany practices and beliefs in fundamentalism (of any belief system) that are<br/>\neasily encouraged and exploited by those who want to create a movement.<br/>\n(Which leads into HSLDA and Reconstructionists and lots else. The Christian<br/>\npolitical movement is huge and you should be aware of it, especially since<br/>\nit has an effect on homeschooling laws.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who use the word Christian to mean fundamentalist Christian are not<br/>\nat fault and shouldn&#39;t be attacked. They are using the word the<br/>\nfundamentalists Christians use for themselves. If you want to be angry at<br/>\nanyone, be angry at the fundamentalist Christians for appropriating the word<br/>\nChristian and turning it into something narrow that doesn&#39;t reflect your<br/>\nbeliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince most (mainstream) Christians tend to feel their religion is private so<br/>\ndon¹t discuss it much and the (fundamentalist) Christians are very vocal<br/>\nabout their beliefs some people do mistakenly equate fundamentalist beliefs<br/>\nwith all Christians. That is not chance. When fundamentalist Christians<br/>\nspeak their opinions, they self identify themselves as Christians as though<br/>\nthey¹re speaking for all (mainstream) Christians but are actually only<br/>\nspeaking for their narrow definition of Christianity.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is *not* safe to make assumptions about how someone is using the word<br/>\nChristian. If you guess wrong you will be, once again, going down the<br/>\nrancorous path we just visited of two people who think they¹re arguing<br/>\ndifferent points of view about the same subject, when they aren¹t discussing<br/>\nthe same subject at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Please* read and respond thoughtfully, with all this in mind. If you are<br/>\nnot aware of the extent of the Christian political movement, then be aware<br/>\nthat there are people here with a great deal more knowledge on the subject<br/>\nof ³Christians² than you have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis topic is *always* a minefield of misunderstanding.
