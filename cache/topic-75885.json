So the first time I got it, I picked out a movie. Then I figured I<br/>\nwould take Alyssa and let her pick, then Sierra and then Joseph. It&#39;s only<br/>\none movie a day. So I went on Monday with Alyssa and we spent a half an hour<br/>\nin the family section while she picked one up and said maybe this, then<br/>\nNOOOOOOO and went along to do it about 100 times. At the end of the time,<br/>\nbefore I was just about to scream she ended up telling me what she wanted.<br/>\nIt was the same movie we had just brought back. The 2nd Peter Pan movie.

I was SOOO frustrated at Duncan&#39;s indecision. Looking back, I see <br/>\nALL those fabrics and they&#39;re ALL so beautiful and shiny and soft and...well, <br/>\nI do that too!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he&#39;d changed his mind only a dozen times or so! Black with blue and <br/>\npurple. No, black with red and yellow. No, grey with garnet and gold. No, shiny <br/>\nblack with the silvery stars. I was about to pull my hair out!<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally he blew up at me that it was HIS robe and didn&#39;t I understand that he <br/>\nwanted it a certain way?  Why couldn&#39;t I see what was important to him?<br/>\n<br/>\nGotta love &#39;im! &lt;G&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s black with red trim on the hood and mantle with silvery stars on the <br/>\nsleeves and a black hat with yellow lining. Whew!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nShort of wanting to strangle him---well, it was more about time and <br/>\nmoney---(final cost? $25! and time spent? 1 hour!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s going to be SO THRILLED with this robe!

There are many things that take me awhile before I understand to my comfort level. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnless I&#39;m not just seeing it though, unschooling, for me has never been a struggle. And the reason why I bring it up is because I&#39;m not sure why it hasn&#39;t been, or maybe I just haven&#39;t *seen* it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been parenting a lot longer than I&#39;ve been unschooling and parenting is harder for me to get. I do have to make a definite effort every day to watch what I say or what I do or how I handle a certain situation. I&#39;m hoping as my kids get older, I won&#39;t have to as much. I know with Tara now it&#39;s so much easier to not do the wrong thing!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe wanted to homeschool way before Joseph was ready to go according to his age. He was 2 when we joined our local homeschool support group. At that time, I wasn&#39;t really interested in checking out exactly *how* to go about it. We just knew we wanted to. Within a year, I met someone locally who was very much an unschooler. Knowing more now, I still know she really got it. She explained what it was to her and what they did and didn&#39;t do. It all just made so much sense to me right away. Maybe because the kids were still really little. But I did have a daughter in school and my husband and I had always gone to school. I remember telling my husband about it and reading one book about the Colfaxes. I never went searching again for more information. I have read other things, but just because they seemed interesting to me. Not really looking for info.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wish my respectful parenting ways came as easy to me as the unschooling did.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75870,"nextTopicId":75912}}
