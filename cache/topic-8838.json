I really appreciated it! If any one else has some input or <br/>\nsuggetions on moving to the country, I&#39;d love to hear them!<br/>\n<br/>\nThought I&#39;d add my two cents on the food allergies.  My3yo has eczema, red <br/>\ncheeks and behavior changes caused by allergies to milk and wheat!  Then my <br/>\n1yo projectile vomits (as in 8 times in one hour!) from soy and eggs!!! Do <br/>\nyou realize how much stuff out there has these products? UGH!!! So we have <br/>\nbecome VERY organic lately!  The one thing I have learned is that I can <br/>\ntrace 3 of the 4 allergies back to my diet when I was pregnant with them!!! <br/>\nI have also stumbled upon this concept in a few books!  So, if any of you <br/>\nare dealing with food allergies and considering having more children, watch <br/>\nyour diet when you&#39;re pregnant.  The biggest thing I learned was to not eat <br/>\nthe same foods all the time and not eating only craved foods!  You ought to <br/>\nsee me watching for the right child to grab the soy milk and the other to <br/>\ngrab the cow&#39;s milk in our house!  No vacations or visits to other houses <br/>\nfor dinner for awhile! We&#39;re just getting the hang of this.<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8836,"nextTopicId":8839}}
