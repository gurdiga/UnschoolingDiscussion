My mother is telling me we should &quot;force him to stick to his <br/>\noriginal <br/>\ndecision&quot;, because by letting him change his mind, he&#39;s learning how to <br/>\n&quot;manipulate people&quot;! Ummm... couldn&#39;t he be learning how to make the <br/>\nright decision <br/>\nin the FIRST place? Learning to know his own mind? Yeah, like my mother <br/>\nhas <br/>\nnever changed her mind in her life... Sorry, all-didn&#39;t mean to get off <br/>\non a <br/>\nrant-my mother just gets my dander up. And this is just the teeny-est <br/>\ntip of the <br/>\niceburg! Okay, going to go calm down, now... :~D<br/>\n<br/>\n******************<br/>\n<br/>\nHe he he... I had a similar experience with someone when DD wanted to quit some activity (don&#39;t remember exactly what it was now...).  I pointed out to this someone that he quit bible college 2 semesters from graduation because he realized that he was not meant for the ministry and would be going &quot;against God&#39;s will&quot; for his life to continue.  Instead, he switched to follow his &quot;God-given passion&quot; and while he ended up spending an extra 3 years in college than if he&#39;d followed his passion from the start, he is happier now and learned a huge lesson (i.e. follow your instincts insted of what others tell you to do).  Why shouldn&#39;t DD be given the same choice and opportunity??   He replied, &quot;hm... good point.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nvote.yahoo.com - Register online to vote today!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100280,"nextTopicId":100287}}
