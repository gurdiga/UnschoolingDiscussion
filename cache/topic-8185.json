Last summer he begged us to let him play t-ball.  Although <br/>\nwe were hesitant, we signed him up, and  he ended up  not participating much <br/>\nat all.  We helped him by coaching first and third bases, even standing with <br/>\nhim at the  homeplate so that he would bat!!!  It just was something he could <br/>\nnot let him relax and do, and after about 4-5 games, we decided that we would <br/>\nnot continue.  Even though he would not play, and would not bat, he still <br/>\nwanted to go, but we felt it was not in his best interest or ours, as we were <br/>\ngetting very frustrated with it all.  I have to say, honestly, that it was <br/>\nembarrassing,too.  I felt like we were being judged by all of the other <br/>\nparents, and it got to be so uncomfortable.  (Being very pregnant at the time <br/>\nwith all the hormones coursing through me, did not help, either :)  I am <br/>\nreally trying to handle things like this more confidently now, though, as I <br/>\nrealize that chances are he would have warmed up to the t-ball games, and <br/>\nwould have become less scared about participating, even if it took waiting <br/>\nuntil the last game to see it possibly happen.  My feelings (and my dh&#39;s) got <br/>\nthe best of us, for sure!                                                       <br/>\n                                        Karen in Ind</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8184,"nextTopicId":8186}}
