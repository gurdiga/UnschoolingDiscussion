Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople helped me unschool and so I&#39;m glad to pass it along.  I think it is SO <br/>\nwonderful to give kids this incredible (and relatively inexpensive) gift.  I <br/>\nthink it will change the world, a little bit, and that&#39;s enough.  Lots of <br/>\npeople don&#39;t get to change the world, but every one of these unschooled kids <br/>\nwill affect the people around him or her, and even if it&#39;s just a little bit, <br/>\nit will be a lot.  Some of them will unschool their kids.  Some of them will <br/>\nbe researchers, writers, politicians, doctors, bus drivers, and will carry on <br/>\nREAL conversations with kids they meet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on.
