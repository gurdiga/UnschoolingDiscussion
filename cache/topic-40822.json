I learned <br/>\nthe ballad when I was a teenager.   It&#39;s a version of The Twa Sisters, which <br/>\nsometimes leads up to a magical harp.  Not this version.  But I learned <br/>\nsomething new about it just last week.  I was looking something up on google <br/>\n(which means mostly that I was home and the computer was on and I had a <br/>\nthought I couldn&#39;t complete to my own satisfaction), and looked up &quot;beaver <br/>\nhat&quot; so I might could say something intelligent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the song the young man &quot;gave his love a beaver hat.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had thought since 1970 or so that this line must mean that this version <br/>\ndated from the late century or early 18th century.  It&#39;s found in Nova Scotia <br/>\nand somewhere more southerly (I&#39;d have to get up and go look and I&#39;m tired, <br/>\nbut I think Kentucky) that I know of.  I thought it needed to be early in <br/>\nAmerican-days for it to be that similar in those dissimilar places.<br/>\n<br/>\nWELL!!!  As to beavers, I did not know until last week these things:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were beavers in Europe but they had killed them out this way and that, <br/>\nbut in part by the popularity of felt made of beaver fur.   So when the <br/>\nsouthern Europeans were knocking over central and southern &quot;new world&quot; <br/>\ncultures for their gold, northern Europeans were knocking over beavers for <br/>\ntheir pelts, and felling trees for masts for ships.  The beaver hat was a big <br/>\nfad in Elizabethan England, and since beavers were becoming scarce-to-none <br/>\nthere, but they were still common in northern-new-world, the fad grew.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my ballad-dating can be backed up to the early 17th century and if the <br/>\nsong existed in England (nothing suggests it didn&#39;t; other versions are there <br/>\nand points north into Scandinavia, I think), then the fact that it&#39;s in more <br/>\nthan one Canadian/U.S. place isn&#39;t a problem at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra who rambles, but still thinks learning is learning and thinking is good</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Tea Party Ship (was historical interests\tof 9 yr olds)","postDate":"1029485713","msgId":41248,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5ODIyQ0QxLkJCMjglZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGFqaDRtaitvZHZnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41199,"nextInTopic":41497,"prevInTime":41247,"nextInTime":41249,"topicId":40822,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
