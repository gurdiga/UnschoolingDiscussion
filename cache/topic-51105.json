When people start in on my homeschooling, I wait for them to<br/>\n&gt;take a breath and then start in on a looooong discourse about how<br/>\n&gt;wonderfully things are going, how happy we all are, how much Tim has learned<br/>\n&gt;lately, how grateful I am to have people in life who are supportive of what<br/>\n&gt;I do, how educational life is, how many interesting things we&#39;ve read or<br/>\n&gt;seen videos about lately, Tim&#39;s talents, his music lessons, his theatre<br/>\n&gt;work, how helpful he is, etc. etc.  By the time I finished, only my MIL was<br/>\n&gt;dumb enough to make another comment, and I just prattled on for another few<br/>\n&gt;minutes and she left me alone for awhile.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My own mother called CPS on me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for homeschooling my kids. She is a teacher and feels that they are more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; qualified for the job.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;SO WHAT!  They&#39;re not her kids, so the fact that she thinks she could do it<br/>\n&gt;better is totally beside the point.  And calling CPS for homeschooling is,<br/>\n&gt;in my humble opinion, a waste of CPS&#39;s time.

If someone truly wants to homeschool,<br/>\n&gt;they&#39;ll find a way to do it, because they love their kids and believe in it.<br/>\n&gt;You don&#39;t need any particular education to do this, just a healthy curiosity<br/>\n&gt;about the world which you can communicate to your children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;brenda<br/>\n&gt;snuffly with a cold and grouchy from it, too!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 7<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 10 Dec 2002 14:19:45 +0100<br/>\n&gt;    From: Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abtleo@...\">abtleo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Digest Number 2694<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;12/9/02 23:53:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Maybe my question here, as well, is does phonetic oriented exposure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; complicate or enhance or can go either way depending on the child?  I <br/>\n&gt; am not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; always able to present myself clearly...especiallly when I am in the midst<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of a ponder...hope I am making sense!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I suppose it would depend on how it&#39;s presented.  But I don&#39;t think you can<br/>\n&gt;avoid having any exposure to phonics whatsover.  They&#39;re all over the place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I didn&#39;t teach my son phonics so he could read.  He would ask about the<br/>\n&gt;sounds letters make when he saw things in print.  And when we sat down<br/>\n&gt;together with easy books, sometimes I&#39;d point out something that might help<br/>\n&gt;him.  For example, he tried to say the silent e&#39;s on the ends of words, so<br/>\n&gt;we talked about how e is quiet but manipulative, because he changes the<br/>\n&gt;sound of the other letters but doesn&#39;t say anything himself.  And Tim got<br/>\n&gt;mad at c, because he&#39;s a thief without a sound but steals s or k&#39;s sound, so<br/>\n&gt;you never knew which sound he was going to be!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Is that phonics?

I&#39;ve been thinking about going to college but I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; scared to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; death!  I moved out of my parent&#39;s home at 17 and went right to work - <br/>\n&gt; never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had the college experience!  At 46, the thought of even going to the local<br/>\n&gt; &gt; junior college is enough to give me heart palpitations :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Beth,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But Beth, just think how smart you are now!

Even if I played cello as well as a<br/>\n&gt;couple of the prodigies now running around the world (and I don&#39;t!), nobody<br/>\n&gt;would be interested in me because I&#39;m not 10 or 12 or 8.  We&#39;re impressed<br/>\n&gt;with kids who go to college at 15, but not with people who wait until<br/>\n&gt;they&#39;re older and know what they want to study and why they need this<br/>\n&gt;degree.  Why?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Personally, I think anyone who can handle the working world at 17 and raise<br/>\n&gt;children should easily be able to tackle college classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;brenda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 4<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 10 Dec 2002 01:15:52 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: Trisha R Sides &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ursadiana@...\">ursadiana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Writing/Spelling<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have been mostly a lurker here, but I just HAVE to jump in on this one.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;G&gt; To the mother of Lars- he&#39;s an excellent writer!

When people start in on my homeschooling, I wait for them to<br/>\n&gt;take a breath and then start in on a looooong discourse about how<br/>\n&gt;wonderfully things are going, how happy we all are, how much Tim has learned<br/>\n&gt;lately, how grateful I am to have people in life who are supportive of what<br/>\n&gt;I do, how educational life is, how many interesting things we&#39;ve read or<br/>\n&gt;seen videos about lately, Tim&#39;s talents, his music lessons, his theatre<br/>\n&gt;work, how helpful he is, etc. etc.  By the time I finished, only my MIL was<br/>\n&gt;dumb enough to make another comment, and I just prattled on for another few<br/>\n&gt;minutes and she left me alone for awhile.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My own mother called CPS on me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for homeschooling my kids. She is a teacher and feels that they are more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; qualified for the job.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;SO WHAT!  They&#39;re not her kids, so the fact that she thinks she could do it<br/>\n&gt;better is totally beside the point.  And calling CPS for homeschooling is,<br/>\n&gt;in my humble opinion, a waste of CPS&#39;s time.  They have better things to do.<br/>\n&gt;Obviously she needs something better to do, eh?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have to disagree my husband has 2 1/2 yrs. of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mechanical Engineer and I am a Certified Legal Assistant in the State of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Texas. I feel that we as parents are equally qualified.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The last statement is true.  As parents, you are wonderfully qualified.<br/>\n&gt;Your education is not relevant.  If someone truly wants to homeschool,<br/>\n&gt;they&#39;ll find a way to do it, because they love their kids and believe in it.<br/>\n&gt;You don&#39;t need any particular education to do this, just a healthy curiosity<br/>\n&gt;about the world which you can communicate to your children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;brenda<br/>\n&gt;snuffly with a cold and grouchy from it, too!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 7<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 10 Dec 2002 14:19:45 +0100<br/>\n&gt;    From: Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abtleo@...\">abtleo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Digest Number 2694<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;12/9/02 23:53:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Maybe my question here, as well, is does phonetic oriented exposure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; complicate or enhance or can go either way depending on the child?  I <br/>\n&gt; am not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; always able to present myself clearly...especiallly when I am in the midst<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of a ponder...hope I am making sense!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I suppose it would depend on how it&#39;s presented.  But I don&#39;t think you can<br/>\n&gt;avoid having any exposure to phonics whatsover.  They&#39;re all over the place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I didn&#39;t teach my son phonics so he could read.  He would ask about the<br/>\n&gt;sounds letters make when he saw things in print.  And when we sat down<br/>\n&gt;together with easy books, sometimes I&#39;d point out something that might help<br/>\n&gt;him.  For example, he tried to say the silent e&#39;s on the ends of words, so<br/>\n&gt;we talked about how e is quiet but manipulative, because he changes the<br/>\n&gt;sound of the other letters but doesn&#39;t say anything himself.  And Tim got<br/>\n&gt;mad at c, because he&#39;s a thief without a sound but steals s or k&#39;s sound, so<br/>\n&gt;you never knew which sound he was going to be!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Is that phonics?  Of course.  But phonetic oriented exposure sounds very<br/>\n&gt;teachy, and you don&#39;t need to teach him to read.  He&#39;ll read himself when<br/>\n&gt;he&#39;s good and ready.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;brenda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 8<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 10 Dec 2002 08:18:32 EST<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Earthmomma67@...\">Earthmomma67@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Re: Not another record keeping question....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You do make it much more simpler!<br/>\n&gt;I think it was the way the website presented it that seemed like so much to<br/>\n&gt;do.<br/>\n&gt;I live in a portfolio state, one that loves to ask for &quot;extras&quot;.

Depending on the test I can get 3 credit hours or more and can cut my time in class! I should have taken the CLEP tests for my English courses because I believe I could have passed that test. I plan to take History and Natural Science tests and get them out of the way next year after taking my Algebra class. I am also planning to take the quickie summer course. They are trying out classes like 1/2 semesters - you do all the course work in 6 weeks instead of 12. I&#39;m going to do that for my Algebra so I can get it done. What it also means is they cover a lot of info - 3 hour class - and there is homework and if a class is missed it&#39;s hard to make up as the work increases in difficulty. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut check into the CLEP tests. That would help with the frustration with the instructors. Luckily I had some really neat instructors, even in my English 1101 course where I had car trouble and missed some classes.
