(I&#39;m now trying to think of something fairly harmless that could<br/>\nbe done repeatedly -- I know people who are always running their hand<br/>\nthrough their hair when concentrating, etc., there must be more than that<br/>\none, though). If you could help him to pick something along those lines,<br/>\nmaybe you could redirect to that and then if he outgrew it, great, and if<br/>\nnot, no actual harm done.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. My daughter Sierra (6) is a crier. She&#39;s very funny and very easy to<br/>\n&gt; laugh and just as easy to cry. She&#39;ll cry if something physical happens and<br/>\n&gt; cries like she broke something. She&#39;ll also cry if she want&#39;s something that<br/>\n&gt; just isn&#39;t happening. Like when the carnival shut down exactly at 11:00 and<br/>\n&gt; she wanted to ride the dragons again. When this happens, she really cries.<br/>\n&gt; If we try talking to her, it gets worse. I usually just hold her and wait it<br/>\n&gt; out. It can go on quite awhile. If I try to talk to her after the fact, all<br/>\n&gt; she says is I don&#39;t know when asked about how she felt or what we can do to<br/>\n&gt; help. I get no answers at all. I feel bad that she gets so upset and feel<br/>\n&gt; helpless.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Six was hard on my oldest daughter, too. I think sympathizing with her<br/>\ngeneral pain in life will eventually move her past it to better coping. She<br/>\nmay NOT know why she&#39;s crying or what you can do about it. You could talk to<br/>\nher after sometime and make a few suggestions of things you&#39;d be willing to<br/>\ndo, and ask her, &quot;Would you rather I pick you up and take you someplace<br/>\nquiet, or sit with you there? Would you rather I talk to you while you&#39;re<br/>\ncrying, or just hush up and rock you? Does it help if I stroke your hair, or<br/>\nis that just annoying?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96545052,"authorName":"marji","from":"marji &lt;marji@...&gt;","profile":"gaia10921","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] suggestions please","postDate":"1035477263","msgId":47726,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwMjEwMjQwOTIzMTIuMDI3YjVkMDBAbWFpbC5nYWlhd29sZi5vcmc+","inReplyToHeader":"PEYxMDhtRHBseGdNMngxVEVVZW4wMDAxMTYxZkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":47723,"nextInTopic":47733,"prevInTime":47725,"nextInTime":47727,"topicId":47666,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Turned out he had so <br/>\nmuch fun, he still thought there should be more time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you Mary, its heartbreaking to see them cry and cry like that. <br/>\nAnd I always feel so powerless when it happens, and I never know what to say <br/>\nand sometimes, no matter what I say he just cries harder. And these crying <br/>\njags aren&#39;t like temper tantrums, this is pure emotion just pouring out!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy Sympathizing with Mary!

Any suggestions would help.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. My son Joseph (7) has always had these habits that he has picked up that <br/>\naren&#39;t the best. First it was him picking his fingernails. He never bit <br/>\nthem, just picked until they bled. Then it was him picking his lips. That he <br/>\ndid until they bled also. Then he started to chew his tongue. He still does <br/>\nthat some when he&#39;s really involved in something like drawing or even <br/>\nplaying gameboy. We would use a code word to him that no one knew but him so <br/>\nthat we could remind him of what he was doing. He stopped doing each one and <br/>\nnow has moved on to something different. Now he touches his penis. Not like <br/>\na scratching, although he has said it itches. More like a playing twisting <br/>\nkind of thing. He has no rash or anything. If I remind him of it then <br/>\nsometimes he crosses his legs real tight like he has to pee. I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nit&#39;s something he&#39;ll grow out of as it seems to be quite a habit. He also <br/>\ndoes this in public.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2. My daughter Sierra (6) is a crier. She&#39;s very funny and very easy to <br/>\nlaugh and just as easy to cry. She&#39;ll cry if something physical happens and <br/>\ncries like she broke something. She&#39;ll also cry if she want&#39;s something that <br/>\njust isn&#39;t happening. Like when the carnival shut down exactly at 11:00 and <br/>\nshe wanted to ride the dragons again. When this happens, she really cries. <br/>\nIf we try talking to her, it gets worse. I usually just hold her and wait it <br/>\nout. It can go on quite awhile. If I try to talk to her after the fact, all <br/>\nshe says is I don&#39;t know when asked about how she felt or what we can do to <br/>\nhelp. I get no answers at all. I feel bad that she gets so upset and feel <br/>\nhelpless.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas with either one of my dilemma&#39;s would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nUnlimited Internet access -- and 2 months free!� Try MSN. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/2monthsfree.asp\">http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/2monthsfree.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48730,"nextTopicId":48749}}
