If it&#39;s &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; it&#39;s real people, and she can&#39;t bear it.<br/>\nThe indifference you sense may be real fear of learning about something so<br/>\nhorrible. I think I must have been 10 or 11 before I even really understood the<br/>\nDiary of Anne Frank, and more years after that before I realized what kind of<br/>\nhorrors really occurred. I&#39;m 44 years old, and still cringe when I see<br/>\n&quot;Schindler&#39;s List,&quot; -- the very thought that human could do that to human makes<br/>\nmy blood run cold -- and the fact that systemaatic slaughter based on race is<br/>\nstill happening in the world makes it even more chilling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest that you save your research results for when your children are a<br/>\nlittle older, and in the meantime, do a theme study on something a little less<br/>\nfrightening. Or if you are really determined to use this theme, search out some<br/>\nof the fiction  books about children who lived during those times, and keep<br/>\nthings very basic. Hiding in an attic in Amsterdam is a lot less frightening than<br/>\ngoing to the gas chambers at Auschwitz. Or maybe switch your emphasis to how<br/>\nchildren in the US viewed the &quot;Home Front&quot; during World War II (the Molly books<br/>\nof the American Girls series are set in this time frame).<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with your research, and when you&#39;re done, perhaps you&#39;d share some<br/>\nwebsites with us?<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Butterflye~~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1509,"nextTopicId":1469}}
