You can get some information on the park and<br/>\ndirections<br/>\n&gt; to it from the Texas Parks and Rec website:  www.tpwd.state.tx.us.   It is<br/>\n&gt; pretty awesome to go down in the river bed and actually walk in the<br/>\nfootsteps<br/>\n&gt; of dinosaurs.  Also in that area is the Rossil Rim Wildlife Center, a<br/>\ndrive<br/>\n&gt; through wild animal park where you get to feed the animals from your car.<br/>\nWe<br/>\n&gt; really like it there.  Try www.fossilrim.com.  But, that&#39;s all about 1 to<br/>\n1<br/>\n&gt; 1/2 hours south of here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good luck Grandma!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Carron </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13038,"nextTopicId":13042}}
