We started doing research<br/>\non the food pyramid and made our own food pyramid and put it on the<br/>\nrefrigerator for my son and I.  We also had labels with magnets on with<br/>\nthe various categories.  The goal was to make sure you had the right<br/>\namount of food from each category.  It was a great way to keep track of<br/>\nour food and really got us thinking about our diet.  We kept up with it<br/>\nfor a while and my son&#39;s pyramid is still on the fridge.  My son is now<br/>\nsix years old.  One of the funny things was you are only to get one<br/>\nsweet a day and he started changing the number one to a higher number<br/>\nuntil now he says he&#39;s up to 7 sweets a day.  He doesn&#39;t get that many<br/>\nsweets a day by the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12299,"nextTopicId":12297}}
