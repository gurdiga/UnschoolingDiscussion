Sowing Seeds is an intensive, two-day workshop designed to enhance participantsÂ¹ ability to effectively and creatively teach humane issues primarily at the secondary school level.   Educators, advocates, and anyone wishing to develop their teaching and communication abilities to work for positive social change are encouraged to register.   Participants will spend each day learning how to stimulate critical thinking and create learning activities that inspire students to more fully engage with and connect issues such as human rights, our treatment of other species, environmental protection and consumerism.   <br/>\n<br/>\nUFT teachers interested in the workshop should contact Dr. Sheila Schwartz,<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HECsheila@...\">HECsheila@...</a>, (212) 410-3095.

To reach this goal, IIHE offers the first M.Ed. degree in humane education and Humane Education Certificate Program (HECP) in the United States.  These distance-learning programs train students to be highly effective humane educators.  <br/>\n###<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62820,"nextTopicId":62941}}
