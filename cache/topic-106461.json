It was white. <br/>\nOn a black field. Nothing at all like the highly detailed, mult-striped, <br/>\ndark brown and maroon and cream pictures I&#39;ve seen from the Explorer space <br/>\ncraft. But it was still VERY cool. Awesome. Amazing. Seeing it live was <br/>\nbetter than seeing the pictures of it, by a long shot, even though the <br/>\n&quot;live&quot; view wasn&#39;t as visually exciting as the pictures.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, HeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Message: 13<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 4 Jun 2005 17:01:23 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Lars Hedbor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lhedbor@...\">lhedbor@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: UNSCHOOLING OPPORTUNITY: Mars as big as moon duri...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Unfortunately, the original message is simply in error.
