This is something that I am struggling with at the moment. I do not see our society producing <br/>\npeople that are truly happy with their lives. I want different for my <br/>\nfamily, but I wonder if it is possible to be truly happy in isolation. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the key is to remember that you are doing what you believe is best for your child.  You want to raise happy healthy children, there&#39;s no crime in that.  Personally I don&#39;t know anyone in my area who is an unschooler.  It seems that everyone else is more &quot;mainstream&quot;, but I&#39;m friends with them anyway.  ;o)  I just don&#39;t try to force my lifestyle on them and they give me the same respect.  I have joined a moms group in my area called FEMALE (Formerly Employed Mothers At Loose Ends (used to be at Leading Edge) that is nationwide, so there maybe is a group in your area.  If not and your feel ambitious you could contact the National Headquarters to find out how to start one.  :)  I&#39;ve attending meetings in NH and OH and it seems that alot of women that join this group are more &quot;progressive&quot; thinking.  :o)  Anyway, I don&#39;t think you need to live in isolation, just find caring accepting people, they don&#39;t necessarily have to be like-minded.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Free voicemail and email, by phone or Web!
