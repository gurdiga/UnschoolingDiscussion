He asked what<br/>\nspanking was and I explained that if he had done something really<br/>\nwrong I would hit him on the bottom. I asked what he thought of<br/>\nthat...he said, well if you hit me then I would go hit Kyle <br/>\n(his younger brother). Blew me away that he would make that <br/>\nconnection.

I&#39;ve been <br/>\n&gt; reading the posts and slowly working my way through<br/>\n&gt; the archives. I <br/>\n&gt; have enjoyed reading about trusting your children<br/>\n&gt; and giving them <br/>\n&gt; control over their own lives. I realized while<br/>\n&gt; reading everything <br/>\n&gt; that everyone was saying that my dh and I had gotten<br/>\n&gt; in the habit of <br/>\n&gt; saying no and we are trying very hard to change<br/>\n&gt; this, both of us came <br/>\n&gt; from families that were very controlling and that<br/>\n&gt; was/is what we <br/>\n&gt; know. We also know that we don&#39;t wan&#39;t our kids<br/>\n&gt; feeling the way that <br/>\n&gt; we did growing up. I do have a couple of questions,<br/>\n&gt; my oldest(Jaiden <br/>\n&gt; 4yrs) thinks that it is the funniest thing in the<br/>\n&gt; world to hurt his <br/>\n&gt; younger brother (Avery 1yr). example: This morning I<br/>\n&gt; found him <br/>\n&gt; sitting on Avery and shoving a plastic screwdriver<br/>\n&gt; into his mouth. <br/>\n&gt; This is a comman accurance, and I&#39;m at a loss, my<br/>\n&gt; mother say&#39;s to <br/>\n&gt; spank him and make him throw away whatever it is<br/>\n&gt; that he used to hurt <br/>\n&gt; Avery with and then make him spend the day sitting<br/>\n&gt; on his bed, she <br/>\n&gt; says that this is what she did to keep me from<br/>\n&gt; hurting my younger <br/>\n&gt; brother and that after about 3 times it worked. This<br/>\n&gt; seems totally <br/>\n&gt; harsh to me but talking to Jaiden dosen&#39;t seem to<br/>\n&gt; work, he tells me <br/>\n&gt; that it&#39;s funny to make Avery scream and if I try<br/>\n&gt; talking to him more <br/>\n&gt; about it, tell him that Avery does&#39;t think it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; funny... Jaiden tells <br/>\n&gt; me that I talk to much and he flops down and<br/>\n&gt; pretends to go to sleep <br/>\n&gt; (snors and all)I just don&#39;t know what to do, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; sure that a lot of <br/>\n&gt; it is his age and ajusting to a VERY hectic year,<br/>\n&gt; but I don&#39;t think <br/>\n&gt; that it makes it okay for him to hurt his brother,<br/>\n&gt; am I wrong? The <br/>\n&gt; other question I had was, how do you balance out<br/>\n&gt; their (the kids) <br/>\n&gt; wants over your needs? example: It&#39;s 6:00am and I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; been up all <br/>\n&gt; night with Avery (cutting in two molars) I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; finally managed to get <br/>\n&gt; him and me asleep and in comes Jaiden demanding that<br/>\n&gt; I get up and <br/>\n&gt; make him mac&cheese, the left overs in the fridge<br/>\n&gt; are toooooo cold. I <br/>\n&gt; tell him that I can make it in a little bit after<br/>\n&gt; Avery and I get <br/>\n&gt; some sleep. He then preceads to make as much noise<br/>\n&gt; as possable so <br/>\n&gt; that Avery wakes up. So, I needed to sleep but<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t able to and he <br/>\n&gt; got the mac&cheese that he wanted. I keep thinking<br/>\n&gt; that there has to <br/>\n&gt; be a better way to do this but I can&#39;t figure it<br/>\n&gt; out.<br/>\n&gt; TIA Rebecca<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; P.S. re-reading this kinda makes Jaiden sound bad,<br/>\n&gt; and he&#39;s not he&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; a wonderful, energetic little boy that keeps me on<br/>\n&gt; my toes.

I&#39;ve been <br/>\nreading the posts and slowly working my way through the archives. I <br/>\nhave enjoyed reading about trusting your children and giving them <br/>\ncontrol over their own lives. I realized while reading everything <br/>\nthat everyone was saying that my dh and I had gotten in the habit of <br/>\nsaying no and we are trying very hard to change this, both of us came <br/>\nfrom families that were very controlling and that was/is what we <br/>\nknow. We also know that we don&#39;t wan&#39;t our kids feeling the way that <br/>\nwe did growing up. I do have a couple of questions, my oldest(Jaiden <br/>\n4yrs) thinks that it is the funniest thing in the world to hurt his <br/>\nyounger brother (Avery 1yr). example: This morning I found him <br/>\nsitting on Avery and shoving a plastic screwdriver into his mouth. <br/>\nThis is a comman accurance, and I&#39;m at a loss, my mother say&#39;s to <br/>\nspank him and make him throw away whatever it is that he used to hurt <br/>\nAvery with and then make him spend the day sitting on his bed, she <br/>\nsays that this is what she did to keep me from hurting my younger <br/>\nbrother and that after about 3 times it worked. This seems totally <br/>\nharsh to me but talking to Jaiden dosen&#39;t seem to work, he tells me <br/>\nthat it&#39;s funny to make Avery scream and if I try talking to him more <br/>\nabout it, tell him that Avery does&#39;t think it&#39;s funny... Jaiden tells <br/>\nme that I talk to much and he flops down and pretends to go to sleep <br/>\n(snors and all)I just don&#39;t know what to do, I&#39;m sure that a lot of <br/>\nit is his age and ajusting to a VERY hectic year, but I don&#39;t think <br/>\nthat it makes it okay for him to hurt his brother, am I wrong? The <br/>\nother question I had was, how do you balance out their (the kids) <br/>\nwants over your needs? example: It&#39;s 6:00am and I&#39;ve been up all <br/>\nnight with Avery (cutting in two molars) I&#39;ve finally managed to get <br/>\nhim and me asleep and in comes Jaiden demanding that I get up and <br/>\nmake him mac&cheese, the left overs in the fridge are toooooo cold. I <br/>\ntell him that I can make it in a little bit after Avery and I get <br/>\nsome sleep. He then preceads to make as much noise as possable so <br/>\nthat Avery wakes up. So, I needed to sleep but wasn&#39;t able to and he <br/>\ngot the mac&cheese that he wanted. I keep thinking that there has to <br/>\nbe a better way to do this but I can&#39;t figure it out.<br/>\nTIA Rebecca<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. re-reading this kinda makes Jaiden sound bad, and he&#39;s not he&#39;s <br/>\na wonderful, energetic little boy that keeps me on my toes.  I just <br/>\nam not sure how to deal with him.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45105,"nextTopicId":45112}}
