He <br/>\nand I went a few rounds on this when we  first met. . . I have come to see <br/>\nhis side of it. He asked me if it was too harsh. . .I said, you are <br/>\npassionate about it. . . nothing harsh about that. . . anyway, here it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\nEvery year there seems to be a debate on whether/when to tell children that<br/>\nSanta Clause does  not exist.  What an asinine debate.  For those who are to<br/>\nsmall minded not to see Santa Clause as he is, you deserve not to believe.<br/>\nBelief in Santa is a right that all children, of any age, have.  How dare<br/>\nany of you try to tell me that there is no Santa.  I&#39;m 32 years old and have<br/>\nknown Santa since I was 6 months old.  I was one of those lucky children to<br/>\nhave his picture in the paper sitting on Santa&#39;s lap.  I defended him<br/>\nthroughout my junior/senior high school years when my other friends fell by<br/>\nthe wayside.  And yes, he still visits my house every December.  Santa<br/>\nClause is more than a man in a red suit.  He is the spirit of Christmas.  He<br/>\nis giving to children everywhere, without ever asking anything in return.<br/>\nHe is joy.  He is charity.  He is love.  He is Christmas!!!!  Those of you<br/>\nwho deny his existence, deny Christmas exists as anything other than any<br/>\nother day.  You deny that Christmas is special and unique.  If you feel that<br/>\nway about Christmas, you have my pity.  As for myself, I look forward to<br/>\nSanta&#39;s visit next Monday night/Tuesday morning.  Have a happy holiday<br/>\nseason.<br/>\nBryan Ellis<br/>\nCWT/Pack n&#39; Go Travel<br/>\n1-800-WEPACKNGO (937-2256)<br/>\n610-363-1566-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30104,"nextTopicId":30080}}
