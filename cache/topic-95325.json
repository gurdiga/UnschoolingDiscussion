For some time, we have imposed clean <br/>\nup time once or twice a day and required the girls (3 & 5yo now) to <br/>\nput away toys in the living room and throughout the house. Of course, <br/>\nthey have never wanted to do so at any time, and in the past we have <br/>\nused punishment as an &#39;incentive&#39; but have decided, after seriously <br/>\nquestioning our lifestyle that we don&#39;t want to coerce this any more <br/>\neither.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur house is very small and our humble livingroom is the only place<br/>\ntoys can be kept. So it gets out of control to the point that I<br/>\ncannot stand the clutter/lack of floor and sitting space. If left<br/>\nunchecked, it spills over into the kitchen and diningroom and starts<br/>\nto choke out the entire house. At times before we would help the<br/>\nkids clean up, and try to make the chore a game by singing songs,<br/>\netc. Now and then we would get good results, but usually ended up<br/>\nwith two frustrated or angry parents who did most of the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, we want good relationships with dds, and are seeing<br/>\nthat perhaps cleaning should be up to us, as we did choose to have<br/>\nchildren and provide them with the toys. And a tidy home (key word:<br/>\ntidy, NOT perfect)is just not a priority that the kids (and not<br/>\nreally to dh, sigh) can understand yet. We have stopped making it a<br/>\ndaily requirement (and I have been trying to let the mess bother me<br/>\nless) and have been saying, &quot;I would like to get these toys put away<br/>\ntoday&quot; instead of &quot;time for you to clean up&quot;. Then one or both of us<br/>\ndoes the job and casually asks the kids for help. When they refuse<br/>\n(act deaf) we have been trying to let this go, BUT...I (more so than<br/>\ndh) still feel, deep down, anger and resentment at times when I<br/>\nam &#39;stuck&#39; cleaning up after them while they sit and watch or go<br/>\nmerrily on their way. Hmmm...is this how they felt when I made them<br/>\ndo it alone?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been feeling selfish - it really upsets me that I do so much<br/>\nfor the family and no one (not even dh, really, but he tries to keep<br/>\nthe peace)wants to help me take care of things that are important to<br/>\nme now and then.
