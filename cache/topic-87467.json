We walk down to the tracks every day to check what&#39;s <br/>\nthere.  Usually a tanker or hopper left on the siding, waiting for Engine 30 <br/>\nto come and take it away.  We take the long way whenever we drive anywhere <br/>\nlocally, looping over as many tracks as possible.  Where&#39;s Number 30 parked today? <br/>\n Across from the Deli?  Behind the warehouse?  Down by Lizzie&#39;s? <br/>\n  On Thursdays during the summer we hop the bus to town to go to the Farmer&#39;s <br/>\nMarket.  We have a car but the bus ride is part of the adventure.  We have <br/>\nlunch on the Square, or at Wendy&#39;s, visit the Thomas section at the department <br/>\nstore, cross the street to the library, and we&#39;re ready to head back home.<br/>\n  Mornings we walk to the park.  Sometimes there&#39;s other kids there, but Jim <br/>\nwould just as soon roll down the hill or chase after squirrels.  There&#39;s a <br/>\nlittle creek there that we sat in last summer, throwing stones and relaxing in <br/>\nthe shade.  It&#39;s down the bank from the park, and feels secluded. <br/>\n  My sister lives across the street from her city pool, so sometimes we go <br/>\nthere.  We spend lots of time visiting my daughter.  Her son is just a year <br/>\nyounger than mine.<br/>\n  With winter here, we spend more times indoors.  Videos, computer, <br/>\nwatercolor, playdough.  Books.  Trains.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;We live in a little town.  The nearest city is Harrisburg PA, about <br/>\nan hour away&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n  <br/>\n  We went to Harrisburg for a weekend in the middle of December.  There was a <br/>\nhuge gun show there.  My husband buys and sells antique and collectible <br/>\nfirearms and accessories.  I sell scented candles.  We took Jim with us and set up <br/>\ntwo tables for the weekend.  Kind of a working family vacation.<br/>\n <br/>\n  Our little town doesn&#39;t &quot;offer&quot; much, either.  But we shop for groceries, <br/>\ngo to the barber, get gas (make sure to wash the windows each time), visit the <br/>\nnursery (Jimmy loves pansies and gets a new pot of them for about a buck and a <br/>\nhalf at every visit),  take the cardboard to be recycled, lots of walking and <br/>\ntalking to the neighbors (I used to be shy until I had Jim!).  Like Sheila <br/>\nsaid, just live your life fully.  Allow your kids to do the same.  <br/>\n  (We do museums, too.  We live near the Steamtown National Historic Site, <br/>\nand it&#39;s a train museum.  And we visit Strasburg twice a year to ride Thomas and <br/>\nvisit the train museum there.)<br/>\nMary J  <br/>\n<br/>\nPS  Strasburg is right there by Intercourse, and Blue Balls, and <br/>\nBird-in-Hand......<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87235,"nextTopicId":87147}}
