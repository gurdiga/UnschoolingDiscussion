Anyway, anything I can do to get the rain <br/>\n&gt; out <br/>\n&gt;  of here for a day or to.  Yesterday was beautiful.  It was cool, but when <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt;  sun came out it was so nice and warm.  The little ones and I had a pinic <br/>\n&gt;  lunch in our yard.

That&#39;s something like 70 days.  I really want to go tubing in the <br/>\nHill Country, but I don&#39;t think they have any rivers left down there.  (Hey, <br/>\nPris -- you&#39;re in San Antonio, aren&#39;t you?  Isn&#39;t there someone else on the <br/>\nlist who&#39;s down round there in the Hill Country?)  Anything you&#39;d like to <br/>\nship down would be greatly appreciated.  Either that or a recipe for a rain <br/>\ndance.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarron</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12981,"nextTopicId":12990}}
