I am writing now to ask<br/>\n&gt; for some much needed understanding and support(help?).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Something happened yesterday, that made me realize my need for support,<br/>\n&gt; which will require a bit of background information, so here it is:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I live in WA state, and I have been homeschooling my 2 children(ages 8 &<br/>\n&gt; 6) for 2+years now.  Unschooling is an informed lifestyle choice I have<br/>\n&gt; made for my family.  I am a very capable single mother, on a limited<br/>\n&gt; income(disability).  My children&#39;s father is not, and never has been<br/>\n&gt; involved in their lives.  They do have male role models, and their<br/>\n&gt; absent biological father is not a problem or an issue in my life or my<br/>\n&gt; children&#39;s at this time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also have Bipolar disorder(otherwise known as manic depression), a<br/>\n&gt; very serious, potentially life threatening(a shocking 15-20% of<br/>\n&gt; untreated bipolar sufferers commit suicide), incurable, but highly<br/>\n&gt; treatable(medication called mood stabilizers, are a must for this<br/>\n&gt; illness) neurobiological disorder of the brain, which affects mood,<br/>\n&gt; behavior, and thoughts.  It is also highly genetic and happens to run in<br/>\n&gt; both sides of my family(and possibly my children&#39;s paternal line as<br/>\n&gt; well).  I had childhood onset type(even more highly genetic) of bipolar<br/>\n&gt; disorder, as did my maternal grandfather and a maternal uncle.  My<br/>\n&gt; extended family, on both sides, is riddled with &quot;mental<br/>\n&gt; illness&quot;(paternal grandmother & grandfather, my own brother & my<br/>\n&gt; father).  As a result of all of this, I have educated myself about<br/>\n&gt; neurobioligical brain disorders(otherwise called &quot;mental illnesses&quot;),<br/>\n&gt; their symptoms, treatment, etc., and continue to do so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son(age 8.5 yrs.), who is very intelligent, smart, and wonderful &<br/>\n&gt; sweet, has been showing signs of A.D.H.D. since birth, basicly, nothing<br/>\n&gt; for which I am too concerned about other than the fact that ADD is often<br/>\n&gt; seen in children prior to onset of bipolar symptoms(a precursor sign).<br/>\n&gt; Last year, I noticed some changes in my sons mood and behavior, which<br/>\n&gt; had me concerned(he seemed depressed for about 2 weeks).  Knowing what I<br/>\n&gt; know about Bipolar disorder and that it runs in my family, I chose to<br/>\n&gt; speak to his doctor about my concerns at that time(last spring), who was<br/>\n&gt; hesitant to refer me to a specialist, nonetheless I insisted upon a<br/>\n&gt; referral.  I could not get him in at that time, since the doctor in the<br/>\n&gt; next town refused to see him, and we did not have a psychiatrist in our<br/>\n&gt; town then.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We now have one (her specialty is even child psychiatry), she works at<br/>\n&gt; our community mental health facility, who is also my own psychiatrist,<br/>\n&gt; and my prescribing physician.  My sons doctor recently referred him to<br/>\n&gt; her, and yesterday was his appointment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I went to this appointment, expecting to address my sons&#39; mood symptoms<br/>\n&gt; and my concerns about his inheriting the family propensity for this<br/>\n&gt; illness, particularly childhood onset bipolar disorder, and what I can<br/>\n&gt; and can&#39;t do about that.  Like what can I do to help my son deal with<br/>\n&gt; his emotions, what signs should I look for, when to seek treatment if<br/>\n&gt; and when...., NOT to get him on medication(I am not even considering<br/>\n&gt; that as an option at this time), for ADD or anything else.  I have been<br/>\n&gt; told, and have read again and again, in my research on this topic, that<br/>\n&gt; it is best to have a child seen as soon at the first sign of symptoms.<br/>\n&gt; I have suspected for sometime with my son(he is so much like I was in<br/>\n&gt; everyway-and so different from my daughter).  I just wanted some<br/>\n&gt; professional advice/opinion, a professional to hear my concerns,etc.,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just can&#39;t believe what I actually got instead and I am infuriated by<br/>\n&gt; it.  I am also very confused, because she is my own doctor(my new pdoc),<br/>\n&gt; and I don&#39;t want my feelings concerning this to interfere with my<br/>\n&gt; developing relationship with her in that arena(because I need her to<br/>\n&gt; treat me, she is the only pdoc nearby), right now, but perhaps that is<br/>\n&gt; being unrealistic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, my son&#39;s appt. was for an hour, and she spent the first part of<br/>\n&gt; that time talking to him, while I was in the room, most of it talking to<br/>\n&gt; me privately while he played in the waiting room, and about 3 minutes<br/>\n&gt; speaking to him privately.  When asked about school, he told her he was<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling.  He is kind of shy of strangers, so he was not real<br/>\n&gt; forthcoming with her, and kept saying &quot;i don&#39;t know&quot; a lot.  During the<br/>\n&gt; time she spent alone with me talking about my son, she asked me why I<br/>\n&gt; was homeschooling my kids.  I told her it is a lifestyle choice I have<br/>\n&gt; made, and something I thought about doing since Skyler was a baby.<br/>\n&gt; (It&#39;s not like something happened to make me decide this or that it was<br/>\n&gt; a sudden decision, you know?.)  She kept asking me questions like what<br/>\n&gt; grade is he in(I said &quot;he would be in 3rd grade&quot;)?, if I knew what grade<br/>\n&gt; level he was at(I said &quot;not really&quot; and was oviously not too concerned<br/>\n&gt; about it)?, and if we use a curriculum(&quot;no, we do not&quot;)?, and what about<br/>\n&gt; testing, etc.?   I was really caught off guard by this line of<br/>\n&gt; questioning, I mean I took my son to her because of my concerns about<br/>\n&gt; him having symptoms of a mood disorder!!!???  How in the hell does this<br/>\n&gt; have to do with curriculum and testing and grade level?  I am just so<br/>\n&gt; angry about this, and I feel I was discriminated against, although I am<br/>\n&gt; not sure why.  She obviously doens&#39;t understand about homeschooling,<br/>\n&gt; unschooling, or my decision to do so, and I certainly can&#39;t explain that<br/>\n&gt; to her in a nutshell in less than an hour!  But, I also felt<br/>\n&gt; discriminated against because of my having bipolar disorder and because<br/>\n&gt; I am a single parent.  She also asked lots of questions about his<br/>\n&gt; father, etc.,  She asked Skyler to list all the members of his family,<br/>\n&gt; who lives in his house, etc, and then she said &quot;what about your Dad?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and he said &quot;I don&#39;t have a Dad.&quot;  She seemed very concerned about this,<br/>\n&gt; but the fact is that he doesn&#39;t have a Dad, and it doens&#39;t bother him or<br/>\n&gt; me(but it did bother her, it seems she didn&#39;t like his answer).  I have<br/>\n&gt; told him about his biological father as he has asked, but he is just not<br/>\n&gt; very concerned with that.  I&#39;m sure he will ask more questions as he<br/>\n&gt; matures.  Once again, other than her asking for genetic purposes, I see<br/>\n&gt; no point for her concern on this matter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you have followed me this far, please keep reading, because this is<br/>\n&gt; the important part of my story.  Now, get this: by middle of our<br/>\n&gt; converstation and her questioning, she &quot;professionally recommends&quot; to<br/>\n&gt; me, that I enroll my son in p.s., if not full-time, then part-time,<br/>\n&gt; because she says even though kids may not want to go to school all day,<br/>\n&gt; for some kids, it is actually good for them(even if they don&#39;t want to),<br/>\n&gt; because they get to be around other kids and develop relationships with<br/>\n&gt; other adults,etc., AND because she can&#39;t really diagnose him as ADD(i<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t asking her to) if he&#39;s not in school, since the way that she<br/>\n&gt; usually does that is to send forms/diagnostic tests, etc., for the<br/>\n&gt; schools/teachers.  I was so shocked I could barely respond!  She could<br/>\n&gt; see I was not pleased with what she had to say, and I just told her<br/>\n&gt; plain and simple, that I was not even considering putting my children in<br/>\n&gt; ps at this time, that this was not an issue at all with me.  She asked<br/>\n&gt; if I ever planned to, and I told her if my kids ever decided they really<br/>\n&gt; wanted to go to school, then they would go(they definately do not want<br/>\n&gt; to now, I know this, and they know they can if they want).  I also made<br/>\n&gt; it clear to her my ONLY reason for concern about &quot;testing&quot; is because it<br/>\n&gt; is required by law, but not until 4th grade(am I right?).  She was<br/>\n&gt; trying to tell me testing/grade level, etc., was important so he could<br/>\n&gt; &quot;graduate&quot; from h.s.(???) and go to college.  My God, who is this woman,<br/>\n&gt; and what does any of this have to do with why I took him there?  I feel<br/>\n&gt; like I am in the twilight zone here or something, haha!  After her<br/>\n&gt; continual questioning and focusing on this &quot;issue&quot;, I told her my son<br/>\n&gt; reads way beyond his grade level(he can read anything he wants to read,<br/>\n&gt; and does all the time).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, I left there with her unappreciated and unasked for advice on<br/>\n&gt; school, and that is it, basicly.  What a joke!<br/>\n&gt; Finally, she spoke to d.s. privately for a couple of minutes, and when<br/>\n&gt; we left I asked him what she said, he told me that she asked him if he<br/>\n&gt; thought he would like to go back to school or something to that<br/>\n&gt; affect!!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What, if anything, should I do about this?  Is this sort of thing to be<br/>\n&gt; expected from a psychiatrist?  I am just so shocked.  Maybe I am living<br/>\n&gt; in a bubble and this is common discrimination.  Do the rest of you deal<br/>\n&gt; with this sort of nonsense?  If so, how do you deal with it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks to all who read this whole thing, and thanks in advance to all<br/>\n&gt; who respond.  This has really upset me and I feel so alone right now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kelly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;Tracy@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"2jPdF7bE6ebZng9pdkNvlFzwFu8uVc56M0kJ4dqd77ViuVcXuaP_E-b6YR81cL2ZZhIneIyXJ4pq_VILmTRY6ylml0LGD8pYAQRq8DLAx00ODYLvwBBJ2hSn","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 311","postDate":"943487544","msgId":4826,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMTMuNDgyNi45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4821,"nextInTopic":4829,"prevInTime":4825,"nextInTime":4827,"topicId":4815,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ____________________________________________________________________________ ...

I could not get him in at that time, since the doctor in the<br/>\n&gt;next town refused to see him, and we did not have a psychiatrist in our<br/>\n&gt;town then.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We now have one (her specialty is even child psychiatry), she works at<br/>\n&gt;our community mental health facility, who is also my own psychiatrist,<br/>\n&gt;and my prescribing physician.  My sons doctor recently referred him to<br/>\n&gt;her, and yesterday was his appointment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I went to this appointment, expecting to address my sons&#39; mood symptoms<br/>\n&gt;and my concerns about his inheriting the family propensity for this<br/>\n&gt;illness, particularly childhood onset bipolar disorder, and what I can<br/>\n&gt;and can&#39;t do about that.  Like what can I do to help my son deal with<br/>\n&gt;his emotions, what signs should I look for, when to seek treatment if<br/>\n&gt;and when...., NOT to get him on medication(I am not even considering<br/>\n&gt;that as an option at this time), for ADD or anything else.  I have been<br/>\n&gt;told, and have read again and again, in my research on this topic, that<br/>\n&gt;it is best to have a child seen as soon at the first sign of symptoms. <br/>\n&gt;I have suspected for sometime with my son(he is so much like I was in<br/>\n&gt;everyway-and so different from my daughter).  I just wanted some<br/>\n&gt;professional advice/opinion, a professional to hear my concerns,etc., <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just can&#39;t believe what I actually got instead and I am infuriated by<br/>\n&gt;it.  I am also very confused, because she is my own doctor(my new pdoc),<br/>\n&gt;and I don&#39;t want my feelings concerning this to interfere with my<br/>\n&gt;developing relationship with her in that arena(because I need her to<br/>\n&gt;treat me, she is the only pdoc nearby), right now, but perhaps that is<br/>\n&gt;being unrealistic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, my son&#39;s appt. was for an hour, and she spent the first part of<br/>\n&gt;that time talking to him, while I was in the room, most of it talking to<br/>\n&gt;me privately while he played in the waiting room, and about 3 minutes<br/>\n&gt;speaking to him privately.  When asked about school, he told her he was<br/>\n&gt;homeschooling.  He is kind of shy of strangers, so he was not real<br/>\n&gt;forthcoming with her, and kept saying &quot;i don&#39;t know&quot; a lot.  During the<br/>\n&gt;time she spent alone with me talking about my son, she asked me why I<br/>\n&gt;was homeschooling my kids.  I told her it is a lifestyle choice I have<br/>\n&gt;made, and something I thought about doing since Skyler was a baby. <br/>\n&gt;(It&#39;s not like something happened to make me decide this or that it was<br/>\n&gt;a sudden decision, you know?.)  She kept asking me questions like what<br/>\n&gt;grade is he in(I said &quot;he would be in 3rd grade&quot;)?, if I knew what grade<br/>\n&gt;level he was at(I said &quot;not really&quot; and was oviously not too concerned<br/>\n&gt;about it)?, and if we use a curriculum(&quot;no, we do not&quot;)?, and what about<br/>\n&gt;testing, etc.?   I was really caught off guard by this line of<br/>\n&gt;questioning, I mean I took my son to her because of my concerns about<br/>\n&gt;him having symptoms of a mood disorder!!!???  How in the hell does this<br/>\n&gt;have to do with curriculum and testing and grade level?  I am just so<br/>\n&gt;angry about this, and I feel I was discriminated against, although I am<br/>\n&gt;not sure why.  She obviously doens&#39;t understand about homeschooling,<br/>\n&gt;unschooling, or my decision to do so, and I certainly can&#39;t explain that<br/>\n&gt;to her in a nutshell in less than an hour!  But, I also felt<br/>\n&gt;discriminated against because of my having bipolar disorder and because<br/>\n&gt;I am a single parent.  She also asked lots of questions about his<br/>\n&gt;father, etc.,  She asked Skyler to list all the members of his family,<br/>\n&gt;who lives in his house, etc, and then she said &quot;what about your Dad?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;and he said &quot;I don&#39;t have a Dad.&quot;  She seemed very concerned about this,<br/>\n&gt;but the fact is that he doesn&#39;t have a Dad, and it doens&#39;t bother him or<br/>\n&gt;me(but it did bother her, it seems she didn&#39;t like his answer).  I have<br/>\n&gt;told him about his biological father as he has asked, but he is just not<br/>\n&gt;very concerned with that.  I&#39;m sure he will ask more questions as he<br/>\n&gt;matures.  Once again, other than her asking for genetic purposes, I see<br/>\n&gt;no point for her concern on this matter.    <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you have followed me this far, please keep reading, because this is<br/>\n&gt;the important part of my story.  Now, get this: by middle of our<br/>\n&gt;converstation and her questioning, she &quot;professionally recommends&quot; to<br/>\n&gt;me, that I enroll my son in p.s., if not full-time, then part-time,<br/>\n&gt;because she says even though kids may not want to go to school all day,<br/>\n&gt;for some kids, it is actually good for them(even if they don&#39;t want to),<br/>\n&gt;because they get to be around other kids and develop relationships with<br/>\n&gt;other adults,etc., AND because she can&#39;t really diagnose him as ADD(i<br/>\n&gt;wasn&#39;t asking her to) if he&#39;s not in school, since the way that she<br/>\n&gt;usually does that is to send forms/diagnostic tests, etc., for the<br/>\n&gt;schools/teachers.  I was so shocked I could barely respond!  She could<br/>\n&gt;see I was not pleased with what she had to say, and I just told her<br/>\n&gt;plain and simple, that I was not even considering putting my children in<br/>\n&gt;ps at this time, that this was not an issue at all with me.  She asked<br/>\n&gt;if I ever planned to, and I told her if my kids ever decided they really<br/>\n&gt;wanted to go to school, then they would go(they definately do not want<br/>\n&gt;to now, I know this, and they know they can if they want).  I also made<br/>\n&gt;it clear to her my ONLY reason for concern about &quot;testing&quot; is because it<br/>\n&gt;is required by law, but not until 4th grade(am I right?).  She was<br/>\n&gt;trying to tell me testing/grade level, etc., was important so he could<br/>\n&gt;&quot;graduate&quot; from h.s.(???) and go to college.  My God, who is this woman,<br/>\n&gt;and what does any of this have to do with why I took him there?  I feel<br/>\n&gt;like I am in the twilight zone here or something, haha!  After her<br/>\n&gt;continual questioning and focusing on this &quot;issue&quot;, I told her my son<br/>\n&gt;reads way beyond his grade level(he can read anything he wants to read,<br/>\n&gt;and does all the time).  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, I left there with her unappreciated and unasked for advice on<br/>\n&gt;school, and that is it, basicly.  What a joke!  <br/>\n&gt;Finally, she spoke to d.s. privately for a couple of minutes, and when<br/>\n&gt;we left I asked him what she said, he told me that she asked him if he<br/>\n&gt;thought he would like to go back to school or something to that<br/>\n&gt;affect!!!!  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What, if anything, should I do about this?  Is this sort of thing to be<br/>\n&gt;expected from a psychiatrist?  I am just so shocked.  Maybe I am living<br/>\n&gt;in a bubble and this is common discrimination.  Do the rest of you deal<br/>\n&gt;with this sort of nonsense?  If so, how do you deal with it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks to all who read this whole thing, and thanks in advance to all<br/>\n&gt;who respond.  This has really upset me and I feel so alone right now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kelly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt;Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"A.

I am writing now to ask<br/>\nfor some much needed understanding and support(help?).<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething happened yesterday, that made me realize my need for support,<br/>\nwhich will require a bit of background information, so here it is:<br/>\n<br/>\nI live in WA state, and I have been homeschooling my 2 children(ages 8 &<br/>\n6) for 2+years now.  Unschooling is an informed lifestyle choice I have<br/>\nmade for my family.  I am a very capable single mother, on a limited<br/>\nincome(disability).  My children&#39;s father is not, and never has been<br/>\ninvolved in their lives.  They do have male role models, and their<br/>\nabsent biological father is not a problem or an issue in my life or my<br/>\nchildren&#39;s at this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have Bipolar disorder(otherwise known as manic depression), a<br/>\nvery serious, potentially life threatening(a shocking 15-20% of<br/>\nuntreated bipolar sufferers commit suicide), incurable, but highly<br/>\ntreatable(medication called mood stabilizers, are a must for this<br/>\nillness) neurobiological disorder of the brain, which affects mood,<br/>\nbehavior, and thoughts.  It is also highly genetic and happens to run in<br/>\nboth sides of my family(and possibly my children&#39;s paternal line as<br/>\nwell).  I had childhood onset type(even more highly genetic) of bipolar<br/>\ndisorder, as did my maternal grandfather and a maternal uncle.  My<br/>\nextended family, on both sides, is riddled with &quot;mental<br/>\nillness&quot;(paternal grandmother & grandfather, my own brother & my<br/>\nfather).  As a result of all of this, I have educated myself about<br/>\nneurobioligical brain disorders(otherwise called &quot;mental illnesses&quot;),<br/>\ntheir symptoms, treatment, etc., and continue to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son(age 8.5 yrs.), who is very intelligent, smart, and wonderful &<br/>\nsweet, has been showing signs of A.D.H.D. since birth, basicly, nothing<br/>\nfor which I am too concerned about other than the fact that ADD is often<br/>\nseen in children prior to onset of bipolar symptoms(a precursor sign). <br/>\nLast year, I noticed some changes in my sons mood and behavior, which<br/>\nhad me concerned(he seemed depressed for about 2 weeks).
