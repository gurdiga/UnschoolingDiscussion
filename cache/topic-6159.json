His first grade teacher expressed that his level of <br/>\nmaturity are below his age group and was afraid of him falling behind in the <br/>\nlong term...then his second grade teacher blew off my concerns and <br/>\nsuggestions about how to help him in class...I have always beleived in <br/>\nlistening to my children...so I got his input on what might help him...but <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t agree...this was about two weeks ago.  I spent a friday evening at <br/>\nwork agonizing over what I was going to do to help him...I determind that the <br/>\nfollowing monday (Jan 24th) that I would check into charter schools and <br/>\nprivate montessori schools...I couldn&#39;t sleep the sunday before and ended up <br/>\ngetting on the internet and looking into homeschooling.  Everything I read <br/>\nsupported how I was feeling and some such...Monday I actually called the  <br/>\ncounty superintendent and wrote my younger son&#39;s teacher a letter explaining <br/>\nhow I felt she and his class actually did him a disservice...(lol) and then <br/>\ntuesday I checked out about thirty books from the library...the one that made <br/>\nthe most sense to me is the one on Unschooling by Mary Griffith...I withdrew <br/>\nthem from school on Jan 31st...I decided that I didn&#39;t want to wait to start <br/>\nthe deschooling process...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy family is not surprised at my decision as I have always been the more <br/>\n&#39;radical&#39; of my siblings... and my mother wants to partner with me in the <br/>\nadventure of homeschooling...we both work at the same nursing home...I being <br/>\nthe charge nurse of my unit on evenings and she is the med nurse...she is <br/>\ntransferring to day shift on the same unit so that she can work with them <br/>\nwhile I am at work.  I think that my mom is just as excited as I am with our <br/>\nadventure.
