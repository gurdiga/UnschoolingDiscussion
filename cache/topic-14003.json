I had paid for a 2 yr<br/>\nsubscription prior to the cancellation.  When I e-mailed them, they said<br/>\nthat I could get a refund or coupons to get something from their catalog<br/>\nfor the same price.  So far, however, I haven&#39;t received either one.  I am<br/>\ntrying to give them the benefit of the doubt right now, though.  I am sure<br/>\nthat if I were in their shoes, I would forget alot of things right now. <br/>\nGoing through something like a family member with a serious illness can be<br/>\nvery traumatic and wearying for the whole family.  I am so scatter-brained<br/>\nas it is, I would probably not remember to send refunds right away. (I<br/>\nwould probably forget to even pay my bills, or make it to certain<br/>\nappointments too, but that is just the way I am!)  :-)  I sure hope that<br/>\nthey plan on sending refunds though, because I would hate to see people<br/>\ngetting upset or angry about the situation.
