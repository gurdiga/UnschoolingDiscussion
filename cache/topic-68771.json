I really think I have been in <br/>\nthis rut since my business sunk the week of 9/11.  I had just opened a store <br/>\nfront that was costly. (bad idea)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a one woman show with my son as my helper doing a 1000.00 a day selling <br/>\nhigh end children toys on the net. I worked out of my home and actually all <br/>\nthe manufactures thought we had like 20 people answering phones in a big <br/>\nbuilding. All my customers knew we HS and that my son helped.  <br/>\nWe have house its a split entry nothing to write home about but its a house.  <br/>\nBetween the dogs and kids nothing looks untouched to say the least. <br/>\n<br/>\nI shop at Goodwill also I actually prefer it. I just cant justify the added <br/>\nfunds on the same items. I wear Walmart or Eddie Bauer jeans not a big deal <br/>\nat all.<br/>\nThere is nothing flashy or expensive looking about me except my car, people <br/>\nthink the car is worth a lot but its not.  I am a jeans and sneakers person <br/>\nalways have been.  I have never carried a purse except at my wedding for 5 <br/>\nminutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont think it&#39;s that I cant go, go, go.  And the kids are great they really <br/>\nhave all they need and then some.  I dont know what it is.... <br/>\nI have actually asked my husband if we could sell this and move to some far <br/>\naway state with lots of land. We have about an acre and a half that&#39;s back up <br/>\nto 11 acres of woods so we are not in the city at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all I think the business had a lot to do with my rut and I&#39;&#39;ll tell <br/>\nyou why.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am rebuilding the site and the business but its not mine.  It is my older <br/>\nsisters. I have been doing her site and giving all the back door secrets to <br/>\nthe manufacturers. She knows before she calls who to talk to who not and what <br/>\nto say.<br/>\nSo it&#39;s knowing that I could be out of this mess in a year or so that gets <br/>\nme. But I really dont have the energy to want to do the same thing all over <br/>\nagain I need a different business.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was never secure but I could pay my bills, now with the business gone I <br/>\ndoubled my debt and that&#39;s scary.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis stuff is always on my mind why it fell out yesterday I dont know. <br/>\nToday is another day, I vented and I feel much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for listening, I&#39;ll try to be positive now.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3899762,"authorName":"coyote&#39;s corner","from":"&quot;coyote&#39;s corner&quot; &lt;jana@...&gt;","profile":"calourojm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Unschooling and funds was  Feeling alienated fro...","postDate":"1052822727","msgId":68830,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzAwMWMzMTkzYyRjNDk4YjQ2MCQ2NTAxYThjMEBBb3Blbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDFkMS45NjA3NjExLjJiZjFhMDg4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":68771,"nextInTopic":68919,"prevInTime":68829,"nextInTime":68831,"topicId":68771,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is so true!!
