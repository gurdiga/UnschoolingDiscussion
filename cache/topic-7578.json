Though I know of<br/>\nseveral mild conditions that go undiagnosed and can affect fertility, I<br/>\nthought I&#39;d share a quick and easy experiment with you.  It took us 3<br/>\nyears of solidly trying and being devoted to the calendar and cycles<br/>\netc. for me to get pregnant.  A tip that a specialist offered me, as it<br/>\nhad just appeared in a study documented in the Journal of Medicine, was<br/>\ntaking a daily low-dose of Aspirin.  Heck, it can&#39;t really hurt to try,<br/>\ncan it?  Apparently, there are many women who actually are conceiving<br/>\nbut the uterine wall is hostile to implantation.  Either too thin or too<br/>\nthick for the newly-developing fetus to nestle in.  Aspirin, with its<br/>\nrecognized blood-thinning abilities, can apparently solve a lot of those<br/>\nproblems.  Meanwhile, many women don&#39;t even know they&#39;re pregnant<br/>\nbecause we miscarry so early we just assume it&#39;s a usual period.  As<br/>\nwell, aspirin can also help keep the fallopian tubes free-flowing for<br/>\nthe same reason.  There can be irregularities or inconsistencies that<br/>\nimpede the process of ovulation.  Since I&#39;ve learned a bit about this<br/>\nand shared my info with others, 2 acquaintances have become pregnant. <br/>\n(I like to think this idea helped.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I don&#39;t represent any pharmaceutical companies!!!  I wouldn&#39;t trust<br/>\nthis info if it had come from the makers of Aspirin.  My source seemed<br/>\ntotally impartial, and a generic brand of ASA works just as well.  Just<br/>\ntake one of those new &quot;low-dose&quot; formulas or break a regular strength<br/>\ntablet in half.  If it doesn&#39;t work, you&#39;ll at least be reassured<br/>\nthere&#39;s nothing wrong with your uterine lining!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust an idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you lots of luck and never give up hope.  Another friend had a<br/>\nbaby 2 years ago (without medical intervention) after trying for 12<br/>\nyears!<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kayelle42@...\">kayelle42@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;    Kim<br/>\n&gt;     I sincerely apologize to you and anyone else who thought I am trying to<br/>\n&gt; offer a cure.  Believe me, after trying for 7 years to get pregnant, I know<br/>\n&gt; that homeopathy will not cure everything.  But I was hoping to say that<br/>\n&gt; symptoms can be relieved or even eliminated.  Even doctors of homeopathy<br/>\n&gt; recognize that some illness can also be hereditary.  This may mean that they<br/>\n&gt; are very deep rooted and may take a long time to heal.  I believe this may be<br/>\n&gt; the cause of my infertility.  But I also know that my daughter had migraine<br/>\n&gt; headaches  3 times a week as a small child and she was allergic to many<br/>\n&gt; different foods which would then bring on migraines, and thru homeopathy she<br/>\n&gt; is now headache and allergy free.  I would never push anything on anyone - I<br/>\n&gt; just want to share what has helped me and my family.  If I have offended or<br/>\n&gt; hurt anyone, please accept my apologies and know that my intentions are pure.<br/>\n&gt;  Good Luck to you!     jackie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; DON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
