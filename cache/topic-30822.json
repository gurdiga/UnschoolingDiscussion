I have 6 boys 10,14,18,19,21, and 29. I have not relaxed for years, <br/>\nLOL It seems no matter what time it is one of them decides they have an <br/>\nemergency, if they aren&#39;t knocking on the door they are telephoning. <br/>\n    We also gave up years ago on getting them to bed. Once we had teenagers <br/>\nit seemed the house never slept. It has calmed down a bit the last few years <br/>\nas the three oldest are out of the house. (The oldest has his own 2 now, <br/>\nhe,he) <br/>\n    I have found the best way to get them to bed is to go myself. The earlier <br/>\nDH and I go to bed, the earlier they all settle in. He would like me to get <br/>\nthem up early (I hs the 10 and 14yro&#39;s) but I do so enjoy the early morning <br/>\nquiet. <br/>\n    I&#39;m also glad that no one sleeps with us any longer, I thought I had a <br/>\npermanent foot imprint in my back but it&#39;s starting to fade now. Not all of <br/>\nthem cared to join us but those that did were sure exciting to sleep with. I <br/>\noften found myself hanging on for dear life. I would wake up and wonder why <br/>\nmy fingers hurt then realize it was from gripping the mattress to stay on, LOL<br/>\nAhhh, the joys of motherhood,<br/>\nLaura<br/>\nStill sane after all these years.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30848,"nextTopicId":30821}}
