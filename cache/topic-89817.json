My dd&#39;s all had severe  integration issues when they were very little - the ball pit proved a sure way to &quot;unload&quot; the overloaded sensory system - or as a tool to prevent sensory overload before it starts.  And most kids love playing in the balls - regardless of age!<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89792,"nextTopicId":89799}}
