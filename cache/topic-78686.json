It was completely new to us as<br/>\nwe had never had him in any school of any kind before that. And<br/>\nit served to show me just ho easily bound up in school<br/>\nexpectations I can become. Sandra and others really helped me<br/>\nto step back from the automatic school-y ways that set in as I<br/>\npressured, cajoled, nagged and reminded my son to work<br/>\nharder. Yuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust yesterday we went to his counselor appointment. He was<br/>\nslated to take Adv. Math, computer science, Sign language and<br/>\nMusic Theory. But he had decided this summer that he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant any more math. I worried since his choice of profession is<br/>\ncomputer game design and programming.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what a pleasant surprise I had in store for me yesterday. His<br/>\ncounselor pressed him to take the math and he took control of<br/>\nthe conversation saying that he had researched and found that<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t even necessarily need college let alone advanced<br/>\nmath for what he plans to do in the gaming world. The counselor<br/>\nsort of clucked her tongue at him and he replied, &quot;If I need the<br/>\nmath to do the work I&#39;m actually doing, I&#39;ll get it then. I see no<br/>\nneed to ruin next year with math I don&#39;t like that I will forget<br/>\nanyway.&quot; The counselor sort of broke out laughing and said,<br/>\n&quot;Well, I can&#39;t argue with that logic.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe then said with disappointment, &quot;Shoot Noah. I thought we&#39;d<br/>\nget you here for all seven periods one of these years.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe replied, &quot;No way. You&#39;ll never get me here for that many<br/>\nperiods. I like my life too much.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe then worked out his schedule so that he can be with the<br/>\ncomputer science teacher (who he really likes) for study hall as<br/>\nwell as class and lunch hour (three hours to work with an<br/>\nexpert). ASL and Music Theory are on trial. he&#39;ll drop them like<br/>\nhot potatoes if they aren&#39;t engaging, says he.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we left he said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how school kids can stand those<br/>\ncounselors. She was so condescending. Maybe they&#39;re used to<br/>\nbeing treated like little helpless kids that don&#39;t know what they<br/>\nwant to do with their own lives. But I can&#39;t stand it. There is no<br/>\npossible way I&#39;d ever want to spend my entire day in a place like<br/>\nthis.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI smiled. And I learned a lot. Let Noah do the talking. He really<br/>\ndoes know what he wants and where he&#39;s going. I&#39;ve just got to<br/>\nget out of the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

It was completely new to us as <br/>\nwe had never had him in any school of any kind before that. And <br/>\nit served to show me just ho easily bound up in school <br/>\nexpectations I can become. Sandra and others really helped me <br/>\nto step back from the automatic school-y ways that set in as I <br/>\npressured, cajoled, nagged and reminded my son to work <br/>\nharder. Yuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust yesterday we went to his counselor appointment. He was <br/>\nslated to take Adv. Math, computer science, Sign language and <br/>\nMusic Theory. But he had decided this summer that he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant any more math. I worried since his choice of profession is <br/>\ncomputer game design and programming.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what a pleasant surprise I had in store for me yesterday. His <br/>\ncounselor pressed him to take the math and he took control of <br/>\nthe conversation saying that he had researched and found that <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t even necessarily need college let alone advanced <br/>\nmath for what he plans to do in the gaming world. The counselor <br/>\nsort of clucked her tongue at him and he replied, &quot;If I need the <br/>\nmath to do the work I&#39;m actually doing, I&#39;ll get it then. I see no <br/>\nneed to ruin next year with math I don&#39;t like that I will forget <br/>\nanyway.&quot; The counselor sort of broke out laughing and said, <br/>\n&quot;Well, I can&#39;t argue with that logic.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe then said with disappointment, &quot;Shoot Noah. I thought we&#39;d <br/>\nget you here for all seven periods one of these years.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe replied, &quot;No way. You&#39;ll never get me here for that many <br/>\nperiods. I like my life too much.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe then worked out his schedule so that he can be with the <br/>\ncomputer science teacher (who he really likes) for study hall as <br/>\nwell as class and lunch hour (three hours to work with an <br/>\nexpert). ASL and Music Theory are on trial. he&#39;ll drop them like <br/>\nhot potatoes if they aren&#39;t engaging, says he. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs we left he said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how school kids can stand those <br/>\ncounselors. She was so condescending. Maybe they&#39;re used to <br/>\nbeing treated like little helpless kids that don&#39;t know what they <br/>\nwant to do with their own lives. But I can&#39;t stand it.
