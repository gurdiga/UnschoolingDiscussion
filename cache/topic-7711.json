In a discussion on the topic, I cleverly dangled from the<br/>\nwall with my husband&#39;s hand on my throat. My breasts were his, as well as<br/>\nall of my body. If I wanted to keep the Da** baby I would feed the F***er<br/>\nformula or let it starve. Then again, since I decided not to terminate the<br/>\npregnancy to start, it was another item on his list of my faults. When I<br/>\nleft, I felt that most of life was my fault, and I was to blame for anything<br/>\nthat was bad. The cereal fell off a shelf at the store I worked for, and<br/>\namongst tears, I was apologizing to my manager for it being my fault. He was<br/>\nmore upset over it than I. Since it was my life, and his just happening to<br/>\nbe there. Does that make sense?<br/>\nStephanie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7709,"nextTopicId":7713}}
