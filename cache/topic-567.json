I&#39;m not often<br/>\nbored, but I had nothing to do today. I was so bored that about an hour ago,<br/>\nI decided to work on fractions with my old high school CD-ROM course.<br/>\nAnyway, I started doing the problems, and about ten minutes into it I<br/>\nrealized that (for the first time I can remember) I was actually stopping to<br/>\nfigure out the problems in my head, instead of guessing or starting at the<br/>\nscreen in despair. So the whole thing turned into a game. I&#39;d calculate and<br/>\nconvert the problems in my head, and then type them in..score!. I got most<br/>\nof them right, and the ones I got wrong I could understand why. This is<br/>\nreally cool! I&#39;ve never been able to understand fractions before. ~Eryn<br/>\n<br/>\n==<br/>\n&quot;I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky;<br/>\nthen I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of<br/>\nbeing a butterfuly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am<br/>\na man?&quot; - Chuang Tsu<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.camenaworks.com/Eryn/\">http://www.camenaworks.com/Eryn/</a><br/>\n#24591173  ::she just is::<br/>\nAIM ::  Opal Fayre</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":566,"nextTopicId":531}}
