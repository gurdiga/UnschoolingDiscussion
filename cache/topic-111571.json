Our birth children we either in their teens or grown, one was already out of the house.  The adoptive children were 6 & 7.  That amount of space was very helpful.  They have no detachment disorder, nor any FAS nor were drug infected.  The absence of these things make a huge difference.  They are now 11 and 12.  If you didn&#39;t know they had previously been in foster care, you would never guess.  They are very happy, well-adjusted kids.  It took time, was a LOT of hard work, harder than we expected.  Even under what I would consider the best of circumstances.  If you birth children are nearly grown and you have a heart for adoption through the foster care system, the rewards are great.  My younger kiddos have been loads of fun. :0)<br/>\n  Ann<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBring words and photos together (easily) with<br/>\n PhotoMail  - it&#39;s free and works with Yahoo!

We adopted three of our foster<br/>\nchildren and put up with Head Start and public school until all three were<br/>\nadopted. We did sneakily practice attachment parenting for the two who came<br/>\nto us as infants, but had to get their pediatrician to write a note saying<br/>\nthat it was a medical neccessity for them to sleep in our room. (One had<br/>\nsevere asthma and the other has reactive attachment disorder.) We had a crib<br/>\nin there for show, but they were only in it for naps from time to time. When<br/>\nthey got old enough to tell the social worker that they slept in our bed,<br/>\nwe&#39;d say they&#39;d had a bad nightmare or try to change the subject. It was<br/>\nvery difficult and not the way I would have preferred to raise infants, but<br/>\nwe did the best we could and got them adopted as soon as possible. They<br/>\nprefer their own space now, but still crawl in with us once in a while,<br/>\nsometimes bringing their cats and dog, which makes sleeping very<br/>\nchallenging, but warm and cozy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nLil<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s the ones who&#39;ve cracked that the light shines through.&quot; Jeffrey Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111615,"nextTopicId":111658}}
