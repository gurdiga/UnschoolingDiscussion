My girl is sweet, <br/>\ncompassionate, responsible, she understands things & thinks things through, <br/>\nwhile my boy (who is 2.5 yrs. older) acts clueless most of the time.  He <br/>\nneeds to be told over & over again the same things (like to blow his nose or <br/>\nto answer his sister when she&#39;s talking to him.)  He appears to be way more <br/>\nself-centered than his sis--I understand kids are supposed to be <br/>\nself-centered.  If she gets hurt he&#39;s more upset that she can&#39;t play with <br/>\nhim than concerned about how she&#39;s feeling.  He&#39;s always been more advanced <br/>\nwith using his body than his intellect.  He can build anything with legos & <br/>\nonce showed his dad how to put the futon back up (having never done it <br/>\nbefore.)  Girl has been more intellectually gifted.  All in all I see a huge <br/>\ndifference between them & their interests are also different.  As far as <br/>\npotty training, we really forced it on the oldest & it wasn&#39;t very nice for <br/>\nany of us.  With the second, we let it go & she&#39;s almost 5 & wears a pull up <br/>\nwhen she sleeps still but she just suddenly stopped wearing daytime diapers <br/>\naround 2.5.  I&#39;ve heard that boys take longer to get the toilet thing than <br/>\ngirls.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nSara<br/>\n<br/>\nI am continually amazed at the<br/>\ndifference between them that seems to be solely due to gender differences as <br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\npretty sure I don&#39;t parent her much differently than I did him at the same <br/>\nage.<br/>\nHave any of you come across this in your family???<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was  a lot longer than I intended...guess I&#39;m no longer lurking:)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth- busy mommy to Shawn and Shannon, my precious angels.<br/>\n<br/>\noh...today we started intense potty training....I think I&#39;m not using the<br/>\nunschooling method here because I initiated it, but Shawn had NO accidents <br/>\ntoday<br/>\nand went to bathroom to pee a number of times without telling me! So I&#39;m <br/>\npretty<br/>\nsure my gut instincts were right and he is ready, but was holding out for <br/>\nthe<br/>\nattention due to little sister.
