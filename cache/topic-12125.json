When that happens it will be <br/>\nbecause he wants the information and it will stick longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe learned to ignore spelling lessons entirely.  Tried to do some at about <br/>\nage 8, but it wasn&#39;t working well.  DS was simply not interested.  OTOH he is <br/>\na perfectionist and really wants it to be right.  That meant he wasn&#39;t <br/>\nwilling to write anything because he didn&#39;t already know how to spell the <br/>\nwords correctly.  Led to lots of frustration and he simply was not willing to <br/>\ndo any repetitive spelling exercises.  For the last 3+ years I&#39;ve been <br/>\nencouraging him to spell the words exactly the way they sound to him.  Since <br/>\nthe words look like they sound, it was a piece of cake for me to figure out <br/>\nwhat he was writing and he got his thoughts down on paper/computer.  His <br/>\nreading level is quite &#39;advanced&#39; and he reads constantly, so I was pretty <br/>\nconfident he&#39;d instinctively figure out how to spell.  I did teach him to <br/>\nread phonetically, I&#39;m sure that made a difference to this approach.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last year he has started asking me how to spell words when it is <br/>\nimportant to him to get it right.  Once he gained confidence in my ability to <br/>\nread what he was writing, it made a huge difference!  Now I let him know that <br/>\nhis spelling is improving.  He spells most words he uses correctly and asks <br/>\nfor help when he doesn&#39;t have a clue.  I encourage him to write it as best he <br/>\ncan when I find the occasional word that is spelled incorrectly, I let him <br/>\nknow how it is supposed to be spelled and give him a phonics rule or nemonic <br/>\ndevice to help him remember it next time.  I don&#39;t expect him to correct it.  <br/>\nHe often does so on his own, however.  We don&#39;t do repetitive drills.  It <br/>\namazes me how well it is working.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an interesting side note, DH is a college graduate and still spells <br/>\nhorrid.  When I would help him edit his term papers the joke went something <br/>\nlike this:<br/>\n<br/>\n    Me:  Honey, how do you spell &lt;fill in the blank&gt;?<br/>\n    DH:  You know how I spell it, you are looking at it!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I&#39;d tell him the rest of the world doesn&#39;t spell it that way.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, it was really hard to let go of the &#39;need&#39; to &#39;teach&#39; spelling.  I&#39;m <br/>\nreally glad we&#39;ve taken this approach, though.  It has greatly decreased the <br/>\nstress in our family.  The only &#39;negative&#39; thing is a cousin that likes to <br/>\nbug DS with claims that DS is stupid because he h&#39;schools.  That is <br/>\nimproving.  We keep reminding DS and the cousin that people learn different <br/>\nthings at different times and it has nothing to do with intelligence.  DS&#39;s <br/>\nconfidence has improved as he figures out that there are some things he has <br/>\nlearned/is learning way ahead of the cousin&#39;s schedule.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;m soooo looking forward to school starting again (NOT!).  I&#39;m sure this <br/>\ncousin will be up to the same stuff.  I hear lots of phrases from him that <br/>\ncome directly from the NEA via his ps teacher.  Yuck!  Just one more reason <br/>\nto homeschool!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis got long...sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Cararmst@aol.com","from":"Cararmst@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"m23pGS1xK8xhDGfG70XkK2mLsDUHIgbdQNlKBdDTTDTD5Evwi9woPI6OQ5aySp4Pkcghe3AbXQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Reading/spelling...","postDate":"967047503","msgId":12129,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU3LmE0ZjhlMDcuMjZkNTUzNGZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12126,"nextInTopic":12137,"prevInTime":12128,"nextInTime":12130,"topicId":12125,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/23/2000 6:43:48 AM Central Daylight Time, ...
