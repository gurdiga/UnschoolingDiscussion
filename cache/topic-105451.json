The father raised a few other children also and she was his youngest and maybe the last at home. I don&#39;t think bad of him for sleeping at his girlfriends house that night, at least he had respect, and he was home at 6AM to wake her, that&#39;s how he found out she was gone....Sad and you NEVER ,NEVER no who is living right next door to you. That Man that killed her didn&#39;t live there all that long, he moved in with his sister....a total stranger. but you are right it could happen with your brother in law or cousin ... scary<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi K<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105443,"nextTopicId":105455}}
