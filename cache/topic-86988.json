Job preparation is the last thing on my mind.  How would I know what type of job my kid&#39;s are going to have?  What if they don&#39;t even get a job?  What if they have their own business?  <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of people have MANY different jobs throughout their lives, and I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s usually the employer, not the job, that has their own set of &#39;rules and repsonsibilities&#39; that they expect of their employees.  There is no universal preparation for the job market.  Jobs come and go, some become obsolete overnight, some fade away over time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m doing any &quot;preparing&quot; for my kids, then I&#39;m preparing them for life, not a job.  (I don&#39;t even like the term &quot;preparing&quot;, it sounds too...mold-ish.)  Life in the &quot;real world&quot; doesn&#39;t have to be prepared for, it only needs to be LIVED.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLyle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\nDate: Mon, 29 Dec 2003 12:26:16 EST<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] RE: Allowance, Responsibility<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 12/29/03 7:46:16 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamabethuscg@...\">mamabethuscg@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; This aspect of the American educational system is well covered in John <br/>\n&gt; Gatto&#39;s &quot;Underground History of American Education.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I mean I would like it discussed that unschooling isn&#39;t  preparing people for <br/>\n&gt; jobs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gatto&#39;s book bugs me because it so completely disregards the majority of the <br/>\n&gt; history of American schools in favor of studying New York&#39;s navel.

This was new to me-I asked my Dad-waiting till he was in a fairly good mood. He laughed like I was really silly. This was (now that I can look back) right after the war-(rationing) which happened right after the Depression era. Which as I grew older and could think about my parents in a more objective way-totally scarred  and molded them. I asked if I could have 50 cents a  month. I think he gave it to me 2 or 3 times  out of the few times I dared ask.<br/>\nWhen our own first  kids were younger-I linked allowances to extra chores-I gave them  small amounts of money occasionally. At that time my husband earned about 300$ per month. I was terribly hard on them  in all ways but I thought I was really  a much better parent than my father. I can see that they, and our relationships remain  adversely touched  by some of this. My younger son came along when we moved to BC. As he grew older there was more time with him, a little more money for fun things. A way better relatioship-There was never any money  around &quot;in purses, Piggy banks etc.  When we adopted our youngest grandaughter  at birth, 12 years later,  we  had more money (relatively)  we travelled-showing our dairy goat herd, I had my own home business, we gave her things when she wanted, we occasionally  used chore sheets etc. we gave her an allowance. She was the focus of most of our time. We took her everywhere with us. We had a great, affectionate relationship with her.   We gave her extra money  often, I knew she occasionally took money from the house and the shop,  I  &quot;talked&quot; about it to her. &#39;we thought we were doing  such a wonderful job-she was very intelligent, inovative, motivated, but as she got into her teenage years-her stealing  from us escalated, her demands for  things went  on forever-we tried in all ways to  develop  her recognition  of a moral approach. She began to  develop an interest  only in her friends that  were ( and are)  quite frankly -lying thieves. She appeared to have no concept  of the &quot;wrongness&quot; of taking from people who worked for their money.<br/>\nShe does however remain loving, concerned, and  appreciative of us and her childhood.(mostly  :0) )<br/>\nHaving spent much time over the past 9 years wondering-&quot;what did we do wrong&quot;-did we  overindulge her-what is that all about.I have to admit being  totally spooked about  a lot of child raising things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the girls, we started giving them  2$ a week each last year,at age 7. They can save it  or spend it how they wish. Usually they pay no attention to it. they have little  recognition  of money. I usually say-thats more than a &quot;Fancy Barbie&quot; as  much as &quot;three fancy Barbies:&quot;  They do peruse the Barbie aisles quite a bit  ;-0)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not making any case  for limiting  money, gifts, allowances at all. Just telling you that. In Hindsight,   I  remain  confused about cause and effect. However I am quite aware that people do what they do;regardless. I know I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know that for us -using chores-behaviour related allowances-privelages- and punishment  was  an awful thing for me to have done in the way I did it with my older children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis if too long now-but Unschooling has  been a major factor in  other areas  that  plagued their mother and aunts and  uncles.<br/>\n<br/>\ngrace<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] RE: Allowance, Responsibility","postDate":"1072725449","msgId":87042,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOWYwMWMzY2U0MCQ2NzJkZjYwMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDkwMWMzY2RhOSQxNjM4OTU4MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBuZXc+IDxCQzE1NzUzMi4yMjU5MyVmZXR0ZXJvbGxAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4gPDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwMzEyMjkwOTM4MDEuMDI1OWI3YjBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":87040,"nextInTopic":87043,"prevInTime":87041,"nextInTime":87043,"topicId":86988,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: Tia Leschke   And I think that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-149926632\">From: &quot;Tia Leschke&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And those two pieces might be serving a very important function in some<br/>\nother game, in another room.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think that is very important for some people to understand.

If one person wants all the Legos in one bin, but another person says, &quot;Who cares?&quot;, the person with the who cares? attitude usually won&#39;t be the one upset about the Legos.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLyle<br/>\n<br/>\n***Always remember, Lead By Example***<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n___________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign-up for Ads Free at Mail.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm\">http://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162967824,"authorName":"Dawn Adams","from":"&quot;Dawn Adams&quot; &lt;Wishbone@...&gt;","profile":"bluenosegoddess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] RE: Allowance, Responsibility","postDate":"1072699188","msgId":87010,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDcwMWMzY2UwMyQ0MmVkYTQ4MCQ3MDRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDE5NC4yMzJmZGI1My4yZDIxNDEzMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":87009,"nextInTopic":87012,"prevInTime":87009,"nextInTime":87011,"topicId":86988,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Your son is living in the real world of a six year old. The &#39;reality&#39; of employment is fantasy for him and has no real bearing on his real world.

Until the lessons about work his parents drilled into him faded, he realized he had choices and decided to work towards a major career change. He&#39;s not in the navy yet but nothing has been able to stop him from pursuing this goal. People may not have immediate choices about where they work but they can always choose a goal to change that. No choice is much rarer than most people care to admit and really not something I&#39;d care to train my children to accept anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Annette writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;Because that&#39;s me!

I still wonder about your idea of a real world however. It seems to hovering out in your childrens future for you. It IS now for them.

(Revision was implied but they added it to the title in later<br/>\neditions of the course.) *Better* than learning to do what someone else<br/>\ntells us is the right way is to figure out what we want (analyze), figure<br/>\nout ways we can go about it (synthesize), evaluate what&#39;s working and what<br/>\nisn&#39;t (evaluate) and, in light of what we&#39;ve learned from the evaluation,<br/>\ntweak the way we&#39;re working towards the goal or even revise the goal itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to see the world through their understanding and their needs rather<br/>\nthan through adult understanding and adult needs.

Our job is to help them figure out what they<br/>\nwant and then figure out how to get it. Their wants and needs and<br/>\nunderstanding will change through out life so learning how to meet specific<br/>\nneeds (organization for instance) doesn&#39;t help them nearly as much as<br/>\nlearning how to go about meeting any need they have.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd at 5 the overpowering need is to play and have fun :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What good<br/>\n&gt; would it do to have 1o pieces in one room and 2 in another and be trying<br/>\n&gt; to build something and have to go bonkers looking for those 2 to<br/>\n&gt; complete it? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It would drive *you* bonkers.

(Lyle happens to be a relaxing neat freak ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy way of &quot;organizing&quot; is to pile. It looks like chaos in my computer room<br/>\n(and, to a lesser extent, around the house).

Their<br/>\nage in dollars per payday, to spend/save as they wish. So far Sarah blows<br/>\nit, but then, she&#39;s just 7. Occasionally she&#39;ll ASK me to help her save<br/>\ntowards something that she wants but if she decides to dip into that before<br/>\nshe reaches her goal, that&#39;s her choice and I&#39;ll let her. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have always had an allowance. For us that meant money given to them<br/>\nweekly, every week, nothing tied to it, and it was there&#39;s to spend as they<br/>\nwished.  Tara is now working for a little over a year and hasn&#39;t gotten<br/>\nallowance since a month after she started. We pay things and she is<br/>\nresponsible for certain things as well. She is very good with her money. I<br/>\nthought I was good at her age, but she has me beat. The other 3 get money<br/>\nevery week also. Money is saved every week that goes into their bank account<br/>\nbut they don&#39;t get that, I just put it in a separate can. They know we save<br/>\nfor them. They always after a large amount of money acquired, put some of<br/>\nthat into their *bank* account. (like some Christmas money) Sierra would<br/>\nalways spend her money as soon as she got more than $5.00. She could never<br/>\nkeep more than that. Joseph would save well into the 20&#39;s before buying<br/>\nsomething. I would only let Sierra know what she would have leftover when<br/>\nshe asked.

Which meant I never had any allowance, because I never &quot;measured up&quot; to expected levels...mostly because I didn&#39;t really care to. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was old enough to work, I was further punished for it by having to turn my money over to my mother &quot;to save&quot; for me because otherwise I&#39;d just spend it as I wanted to. All that taught me was to lie about my earnings, spend earnings quickly in order to have something I wanted, then hide/lie some more to cover up having bought something I wanted. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor all the book knowledge and lectures in the world over how to handle money, that was the real lesson I learned. I still struggle with it now, 10 years that I&#39;ve been on my own/married. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn contrast, my husband&#39;s allowance was just his allowance. He could spend it as he chose. When he was old enough to work, the allowance stopped, but he had his earnings. No questions asked, no lectures about savings. He learned to take care of the important things (his car payment and insurance were his primary expenses) then his wants/needs (cigarettes mostly as his parents still met his needs for clothing/shelter/food). Not that he&#39;s a penny-pincher but he&#39;s responsible. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is responsible with his money because he taught himself to be responsible, because he was ALLOWED to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, our children have an allowance starting at age 5. Their age in dollars per payday, to spend/save as they wish. So far Sarah blows it, but then, she&#39;s just 7. Occasionally she&#39;ll ASK me to help her save towards something that she wants but if she decides to dip into that before she reaches her goal, that&#39;s her choice and I&#39;ll let her. <br/>\n<br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything I need to know, I learned on my own!<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Most people<br/>\nare lucky enough to be able to chose what they do in life and what<br/>\nduties they take on in a job, but some people are not that lucky at all<br/>\nand they are forced to take any job they can and endure a harder life.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA source of income no, but money of their own given unconditionally for them<br/>\nto do with as they see fit, yes. I would at least say that most who post<br/>\nhere do it that way. Money given with no attachments. It&#39;s not really<br/>\nconsidered income because there is no job. But giving money like that helps<br/>\nthe child with a lot more than just the concept of saving and spending. And<br/>\nI tend to disagree with the whole no choice stuck in a crappy job thing.<br/>\nThere is always a choice. Sometimes one does have a crappy job but there is<br/>\nalways the choice to look for better/different.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Yes, without some guide as to how to do it or how it will be easiest,<br/>\nhow will they know? We HAVE lived this already and just want to help<br/>\nthem. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut again what you see as easier won&#39;t always be seen the same way to<br/>\nothers. I know plenty of people, (live with one) who seem totally<br/>\ndisorganized but funtion quite nicely. Better than I ever would under those<br/>\nsame circumstances and vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Of course, clean is not what I would call clean...that&#39;s when I go in<br/>\nand do it after the fact! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all well and good as long as one isn&#39;t asked to do something, or even<br/>\nmade to do something, and then have someone else go and redo it. If I feel<br/>\nstrongly enough about something like that, I would never ask anyone to do it<br/>\nin the first place. Why would anyone ever *want* to try and do something<br/>\nsomeone else would go and do over later? And what we are talking about with<br/>\nneatness or cleanliness is wanting our children to *want* to do it for them,<br/>\nnot because mom wants them to or someone else made them all their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Because that&#39;s me! Some people cant see dirt on the toilet or in the<br/>\nkitchen, I like for all the legos to be in the same place. What good<br/>\nwould it do to have 1o pieces in one room and 2 in another and be trying<br/>\nto build something and have to go bonkers looking for those 2 to<br/>\ncomplete it? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the legos in the lego bin too. But I never make the kids put them<br/>\nthere. Most end up there but some end up in separate bins too. So I don&#39;t<br/>\n*make* the kids move them so they are all together where I like them.<br/>\nSometimes if they are out of place long enough, I&#39;ll ask if I can put them<br/>\nwhere all the rest are. &lt;bg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;You are right, kids don&#39;t give a hoot about cleaning. They just want to<br/>\nplay and bounce off the walls! BUT, I do feel that a certain level of<br/>\ncleanliness is important in the real world. How else will they learn<br/>\nunless we model a clean living environment. And I don&#39;t mean nagging and<br/>\nmaking them do it, but showing them how pleasant it is to be in a clean<br/>\nand tidy home. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd modeling that and not imposing it is the best way for that to happen<br/>\nnaturally for the child. And modeling just means doing it ourselves and not<br/>\nsaying &quot;okay lets clean up this room, legos go here and those things go over<br/>\nthere, etc.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;This concept sounds great for older children that understand the concept<br/>\nof money and bills. My 6 yr old would not benefit from this yet. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut many children do understand that concept at early ages. My kids get<br/>\nconsumerism and saving and spending and paying bills. Just from everyday<br/>\nlife with us they understand that we even pay for our water. It&#39;s natural<br/>\nfor them to see that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see chores as having the kids do things they wouldn&#39;t normally do right<br/>\nnow because they want the money they are getting paid to do it. So even when<br/>\nthey are being paid to clean their room, they aren&#39;t really cleaning because<br/>\nthey like it that way or even because mom does, they clean for money. And I<br/>\nwas wondering if your son doesn&#39;t spend any he *makes* maybe he&#39;s wondering<br/>\nif the day will come when he won&#39;t want to do any chores at all, making no<br/>\nmoney. At least he&#39;ll have what he has now.

A person is only a kid for a short time, let them enjoy it,<br/>\n&gt; because they will have the rest of their lives to feel the &#39;burden&#39; of<br/>\n&gt; things like cleaning, just like we all do now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are right, kids don&#39;t give a hoot about cleaning. They just want to<br/>\nplay and bounce off the walls! BUT, I do feel that a certain level of<br/>\ncleanliness is important in the real world. How else will they learn<br/>\nunless we model a clean living environment. And I don&#39;t mean nagging and<br/>\nmaking them do it, but showing them how pleasant it is to be in a clean<br/>\nand tidy home. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My two oldest and I read about the sustainable earth one day--someone<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sent<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a link.
