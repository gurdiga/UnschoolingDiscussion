I always admired my aunt&#39;s family<br/>\n&gt; (8 kids on a farm) because it seemed like they all pitched in and did what<br/>\n&gt; needed to be done and enjoyed doing it.  That was a child&#39;s perspective, of<br/>\n&gt; course, and they may have gotten along better with company around and it may<br/>\n&gt; have been more structured than it appeared to my child&#39;s eyes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My sister has 3 kids and she has charts and points and rewards and she has<br/>\n&gt; to keep upping the points earned and the points neccessary to receive<br/>\n&gt; things.  (Did that make sense?)  The usual rewards are Beanie Babies and<br/>\n&gt; before long they either don&#39;t have a Beanie that they really want or they<br/>\n&gt; just don&#39;t want to do the jobs - so they don&#39;t.  This has escalted to the<br/>\n&gt; point that they now get 500 pts a day if they keep their rooms &quot;reasonably&quot;<br/>\n&gt; picked up - meaning if you can&#39;t see the mess from the doorway!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of course you never know how life will turn out BUT - IMHO - your kids will<br/>\n&gt; grow up to be well adjusted adults who know how to share space and<br/>\n&gt; responsibilities.  Of course one of them will probably be a hermit in a huge<br/>\n&gt; house, seeking space and quiet and choosing not to recreate his/her crazy<br/>\n&gt; childhood!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unschooler or not, you all live there and you all have to pitch in or you<br/>\n&gt; would never dig your way to the door!  Hmm - or they could be digging their<br/>\n&gt; way to the door to go visit Mom after she has a complete breakdown!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Keep up the good work and let us know when #7 arrives!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Becky in Ohio<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  home to the world&#39;s liveliest email communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Check it out!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\nbest wishes<br/>\nJoel<br/>\n<br/>\nAll children behave as well as they are treated.
