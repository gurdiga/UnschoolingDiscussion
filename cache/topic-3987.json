We don&#39;t use any one specific curriculum or method to<br/>\n&gt;accomplish this task, but use what works for each child at that<br/>\n&gt;particular moment in time.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is not the first online newsletter that I&#39;ve written  :-) Some of<br/>\n&gt;you may recognize my name and style from AOL&#39;s Homeschool Connection<br/>\n&gt;Newsletter that I wrote a while back. I would like to take the time to<br/>\n&gt;say that I love to hear from you readers!!
