I&#39;ll last this winter here, but I&#39;m getting out<br/>\n&gt; before summer. I get as much cabin fever here in the summer where you can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; go outside in the heat as I figure people in the snow get. When it starts to<br/>\n&gt; cool down in November and we can open the windows, I feel like a new person,<br/>\n&gt; and start to get a little energy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OTOH, though, I don&#39;t want to go where there&#39;s a LOT of snow, either, just<br/>\n&gt; someplace with four seasons.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think I have our solution here!
