The first time I believe was someone at<br/>\nthe school that my children used to attend.  It happened the first year<br/>\nwe hs&#39;ed.  The second time was two years later and I have since found out<br/>\nit was my husband&#39;s insane cousin who turned us in.  Both times the<br/>\n&#39;allegations&#39; were provably false.  And both time CPS refused to tell me<br/>\nwho turned me in.  Here is my advice:<br/>\n1.  Stay very calm.  It is unsettling for them if you are way more stable<br/>\nthan they are.  (worked wonders the second time they showed up.  I was<br/>\ntoo exhausted to care - long story - and they were quite obviously<br/>\nunnerved by my calmness.  So I just calmly told them to stay on the porch<br/>\ntell me what they wanted to say and that I would respond &quot;soon&quot; which was<br/>\nimmediately by fax.) <br/>\n2.  Respond in writing and include a statement that you consider this<br/>\nallegation harrassment.<br/>\n3.  Insist on getting a letter that say the case was closed as unfounded.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have since taken to writing or faxing CPS occassionally and asking them<br/>\nwhat their policy is regarding harassing complaints and if the person who<br/>\nis turned in falsely has any recourse.  I like to point out that clause<br/>\nin the consitution about facing your accuser occassionally too.  It does<br/>\nabsolutely nothing but in the long run, it may make them see that<br/>\ninnocent until proven guilty has some merit. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and if you want to talk off list feel free.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Date: Tue, 16 Oct 2001 17:50:29 +0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: Dawn Bennink &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dbennink@...\">dbennink@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Question about CPS<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am floored.
