MADE IT THROUGH.  No phone calls, no homesickness.  I woke up and realized she is in the next stage of attachment, and I feel a bit sad and proud at the same time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is so odd watching them grow, and take their place among the world, and wondering if I did it right, what I did wrong, and how I may never really know...<br/>\n<br/>\nbe well,<br/>\nRachel Ann <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: April <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, October 01, 2002 4:29 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] hitting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra,<br/>\n  I was just thinking these kinds of thoughts! It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s been that long when I was the mom of young kids looking up to  families that had teens and thinking &#39;wow, they&#39;re so together and have such great kids&#39;, sheesh, I blink a couple of times and now families with young kids are looking at me that way!!!  I can have a complete conversation with dh, I can read chapters at a time in a book without being interrupted, nobody needs help getting dressed or making lunch,  I hardly ever get woken at night (though the girls had a friend stay over last night I had woke up to giggles a few times).  They really don&#39;t stay little long do they?!  But what fun they are as big kids!!<br/>\n  ~April<br/>\n  Homeschooling Mom to: Kate-16, Lisa-13, Karl-11, and Ben-7<br/>\n  Facilitator to REACH-Auburn Hills, an inclusive Homeschool Group in Auburn Hills, MI<br/>\n<br/>\n    ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n    Sent: Tuesday, October 01, 2002 3:28 PM<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] hitting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    In a message dated 10/1/02 1:23:21 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummyone24@...\">mummyone24@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n    &lt;&lt; I see Sierra doing things that Joseph did a <br/>\n    while ago and doesn&#39;t do anymore.
