I think they can and do <br/>\nwork (at least in some instances) and will probably improve over time <br/>\nas the idea gains momentum and more options are available. Also, when <br/>\nyou&#39;re talking about schools where mostly homeschoolers attend, I&#39;d <br/>\nhave to guess that those kids always have the option to *not* be <br/>\nthere and as some have pointed out, that is probably the biggest <br/>\ndetermining factor of whether or not any educational option is useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big issue that is brought up about schools being compulsory is <br/>\nprobably a moot point for many children anyways. Schools are <br/>\nbasically subsidized daycare for many kids - both of their parents <br/>\nwork and so they need to be *somewhere*. If the quality of <br/>\nthe &quot;somewhere&quot; improves so that kids at least have choices about <br/>\nwhat they want to learn and when, well that would be a big <br/>\nimprovement over what is happening for most kids right now where they <br/>\nhave no power at all. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;A bee is pollinating my eye&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) &quot;Asa eat buggy&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Betsy Hill","from":"&quot;Betsy Hill&quot; &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"N2Whkox0KLhw8IJOnfXob7Wxj8pUcTWyUlfdENkACJFB13YkRjqtqFUOqzspciM8gGbiB-N6JwDGqGeaQojxhUdKTUpc8Siz5mujsOw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] For those who think public schools are  doomed...","postDate":"991244468","msgId":22238,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI3M0E3MEMyLTMyN0M2QDIwOS4xNzkuMTkzLjU+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22308,"prevInTime":22237,"nextInTime":22239,"topicId":22238,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
