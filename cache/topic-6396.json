This was preunschooling days. :)  (Notice I was<br/>\nsearching, not him, that&#39;s the key,  he hadn&#39;t even asked for something to<br/>\nread!  I just thought he needed to be reading something.)    I suggested the<br/>\nUnfortunate Events, Narnia, Redwall,  all sorts of adventure books,  nope.<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t want to read those.  Maybe he just didn&#39;t want to read anything<br/>\nright then.  He did read HP5 when it came out, in about 2 days!  What he has<br/>\nfound that he likes right now is the DragonballZ graphic novels and the<br/>\nShowen Jumps.   And now Eragon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s my dd, Abbi(9),  who doesn&#39;t want to sit and listen to me read<br/>\nanymore, :( and doesn&#39;t want to read through such a long book as HP books,<br/>\n(she says they look too long) but then the other day asked to sit with me<br/>\nand read Macbeth.   She also reads the graphic novels,  like Rurouni<br/>\nKenshin,  which I like because of the history that I&#39;m learning.  Her<br/>\ninterest in Anime has led to Tae-Kwon-Do,  Japanese and Chinese writing,<br/>\nhistory of Japan and China  and lots of other stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just never know.............<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLet them do what they want and they may end up in the Classics.

I love books, and there isn&#39;t a room in my house that isn&#39;t<br/>\npiled high with them. People are always giving me more, because they know<br/>\nour family enjoys them. One time my sister, who at the time had a 3yo,<br/>\n6yo, and 12yo, brought me over crates of childrens books that she cleaned<br/>\nout of her house. I asked her if she wanted to wait till the children<br/>\noutgrew them, and she just said no, that is what school is for. I almost<br/>\nalways buy her children books for gifts, and they will ask her if she<br/>\nwill read them that night. She always gives them a &quot;We&#39;ll see&quot;.<br/>\nNot me! I&#39;m always trying to read books to my children, and they love it.<br/>\nLast summer we went to a flea market and the girls ran right past the<br/>\ntables of beanie babies and time-out dolls, straight for the new book<br/>\ntables. I told them that they could each pick out two books. They were<br/>\nhaving trouble deciding because there were so many nice ones. The elderly<br/>\nman selling the books said that any children that excited about books<br/>\ndeserves to have them, and proceeded to give them a stack of about six<br/>\nbrand new books for free! The girls were so happy that they gave the man<br/>\n(a total stranger) a big hug.

It&#39;s a compilation of life<br/>\nstories by 11 teenagers who either left school to unschool, or never went to<br/>\nschool at all, and how it has effected their lives.  Each story is written<br/>\nby the actual teenager.  My own teenage son read it and so identified with<br/>\n&quot;Patrick&#39;s Story&quot;, that he quit high school the following week and hasn&#39;t<br/>\nlooked back since.  He&#39;s happier than he&#39;s ever been, and passion has<br/>\nreturned to his life.  That&#39;s been two years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nShelley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: silvertree &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silvertree@...\">silvertree@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, February 11, 2000 5:34 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] books<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;silvertree&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silvertree@...\">silvertree@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really liked Child&#39;s Work as well.
