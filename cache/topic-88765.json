To make grandma happy?  If that&#39;s what you mean, I let that one fly out the window years ago.  Grandma&#39;s happiness is up to her, not you or your kids.  If being yourselves isn&#39;t good enough, then what will be?  She said that she &quot;knows&quot; your daughter is going to need &quot;goals&quot;, but how can she possibly know what your daughter is going to do with her life?  It sounds like grandma has some pretty high expectations (and I&#39;m guessing she will just keep raising the bar), and depending on your daughter&#39;s personality, that could lead to disaster.  I stay away from expectations for my kids.  Too much potential for disappointment and discouragement.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI want my kids to be themselves, to believe in themselves and to trust their own judgement.  That&#39;s as far as my &quot;expectations&quot; go.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~~&quot;I  just expect some traditional educational goals because I know she&#39;s going to need them.&quot;~~<br/>\n<br/>\nThat statement alone would be more than enough for me to have a long...&quot;talk&quot; with grandma.  What grandma expects is irrelavant.  I would let her know that.  (Keep in mind that I am very blunt and to the point when it comes to my kids.)  My FIL (and the rest of my inlaws) had this same attitude when we first started out.  It came down to me making it very clear that if their attitudes didn&#39;t change, they would see a lot less of  us.  Grandpa has rarely ever mentioned anything about schooling or education since then.  He has even expressed how impressed he is with my boys after seeing the &#39;results&#39; of our choices.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t bother with grandma&#39;s list of goals, but that&#39;s just me.  If anything, let your daughter make the list herself.  If that&#39;s not good enough...too bad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t go out of my way to make someone else happy, regardless of who it is, if they don&#39;t bother trying to understand what we&#39;re doing.  Let grandma put out a little effort on changing the way she looks at things.  SHE needs to try to change, not you or your daughter.  Her concerns may be honest and heartfelt, but her methods could use a little tweaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyle <br/>\n<br/>\n(If I misread your post, and this is not what grandma was meaning, then just disregard this, lol.)<br/>\n<br/>\n***Always remember, Lead By Example***<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n___________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign-up for Ads Free at Mail.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm\">http://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":147376218,"authorName":"liza sabater","from":"liza sabater &lt;listdiva@...&gt;","profile":"lm_sabater","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Input please!

It started when she asked me to have Sarah write out a letter or thank you note for the Christmas presents. I wrote her back that Sarah would be happy to, although she prefers to type rather than write by hand so I wanted her to have a head&#39;s up about that. My mother wrote back saying &quot;Sarah is 9 and needs to be hand writing things.  I will<br/>\nsend a written letter back when she hand writes a letter to me.  Its a requirement in life, and I&#39;m a good one for her to practice on.  If she was in school, she would have to hand write everything every day, I think she needs to be doing what she would have to do in<br/>\nschool.&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nI wrote back &quot;Actually, she&#39;ll be 8 in March! Sarah does write by hand when<br/>\nshe wants to...she just prefers to type. She decided she wants to write<br/>\nit by hand so she&#39;s working on it right now.
