But , my two cents worth....<br/>\nI have 8 and 10 year old daughters.<br/>\nThe 10 year old is just getting into the real-life dramas..like the<br/>\nhistorical effects of war, hatred and the damage it can inflict over<br/>\ndecades and centuries, etc. Two years ago , she did not even want to read<br/>\nthe Narnia series because she found it &#39;mean, scarey, &quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI think all children need time to find a comfort zone with the seedier to<br/>\nthe more horrific things in life. Maybe your daughter is trying to tell you<br/>\nthat it is not the right time for her to deal with this???  Give her a list<br/>\nof other activities/field trips you might organize together and see if<br/>\nthere is something on the list that makes her come alive with interest. <br/>\n<br/>\nSave the very important lessons from the Holocaust until she is ready.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a suggestion, <br/>\nBrooke<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:42 PM 7/12/99 EDT, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KSeebose@...\">KSeebose@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just joined this loop after hsing for a couple of years... my girls are 5, <br/>\n&gt;7 and 1...  I have a question for anyone open to answer it...  In our <br/>\n&gt;homeschooling support group one of our contributions to the group is to plan <br/>\n&gt;an activity/field trip per semester.  I really want to plan one on the <br/>\n&gt;Holocaust for a variety of reason... I&#39;m sensing indifference from my 7 year <br/>\n&gt;old, at just the beginning of my research... this infuriates me... I&#39;m being <br/>\n&gt;unrealisitic  (kick me.. I know!  :-) But this is important to me and I <br/>\n&gt;believe she needs to know about this. Perhaps with further research it may <br/>\n&gt;pique (sp?  right word even?) her interest...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thoughts...?
