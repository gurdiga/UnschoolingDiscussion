Not so much about tv, because <br/>\nthey have always made choices there which I have had no cause to question.  <br/>\nBut with food, it was exceptionally difficult.  My 5 year old boy has one <br/>\npotentially fatal allergy  (peanuts) and one that gives him eczema (processed corn <br/>\nadditives).  Once I gave up control of his eating, he ran with it.  He asks <br/>\nwhat is in something, wont touch anything with chocolate in it and always tells <br/>\npeople of his allergies.  Today a mom at our homeschool group offered him <br/>\nunfamiliar crackers and he said he couldn&#39;t eat them without me reading the label <br/>\nand because there was no label, he&#39;d just rather not.  I thought to myself, <br/>\n&quot;What a kid!&quot;, but they are all this way if we let them be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve worked very hard recently on finding the value in superman and I think <br/>\nI&quot;m there, thanks to help from this list.  <br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: was: enjoying my kids re:shows we don&#39;t agree...","postDate":"1065749481","msgId":82628,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkZi4xMTUzODQ1Ni4yY2I3NjVlOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":82678,"prevInTime":82627,"nextInTime":82629,"topicId":82628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Your feelings and concerns are normal I would say.

It is hard to relax and <br/>\ntrust the child will come out in the end functioning fine but they will.<br/>\nMy daughter watches the shows you listed in the likes and dislikes. Some days <br/>\nshe does and some she does not. She prefers rugrats and all the Nick, Jr. <br/>\nshows.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what matters is not the shows, movies and outsiders but rather the <br/>\nparent model. If you are not beating people over the head or committing crimes <br/>\nyour son will be just fine.

The <br/>\nfairly oddparents really gets under my skin and that one we do not <br/>\nallow because I think he is too young.  In general, I think I am <br/>\nhaving difficulty seeing value in some of these shows.  I am <br/>\nstruggling with how much freedom to give.  IS he making an <br/>\nintelligent choice or just staring like a dog foaming at the mouth  <br/>\nwatching shows that corporate america has put out there marketed to <br/>\nlittle boys (harsh but how I feel. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82440,"nextTopicId":82685}}
