I will let Lisa know.  I set up an e-mail<br/>\naccount for her many months ago, so that she could write to her friends<br/>\nwho have e-mail.  So far, she isn&#39;t interested in writing/typing.  Would<br/>\nrather talk on the phone, but I don&#39;t have a budget for long distance<br/>\ncalls.  Only checks her e-mail when I remind her.  So it obviously isn&#39;t<br/>\nimportant to her right now!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did have a &quot;school&quot; experience yesterday.  Babysat for a neighbor and<br/>\ndrove &quot;E&quot; to school for afternoon kindergarten.  This happens to be<br/>\nlunch/recess (40 minutes to do both).  Lisa was able to find some of her<br/>\nneighborhood friends and enjoyed being with them for a little while. <br/>\nExcept that on the field, the boys were chasing the girls and she said<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t like that.  &quot;E&quot; refused to play on the playground.  He said<br/>\nkindergartners are not allowed on the playground when the bigger kids are<br/>\non it.  I had told his mom that we were going to go in early and that I<br/>\nwould supervise him and my 5 year old, and it was fine with her.  But E<br/>\ninsisted that he could not be on the playground, even if I was there with<br/>\nhim.  So he spent 20 minutes standing in line outside his classroom. <br/>\nThey have a cement courtyard for the kindergarten, with nothing in it.  I<br/>\nhad brought 2 jump ropes and a ball.  But E didn&#39;t even want to play that<br/>\nwith us in the courtyard.  He just stood there, waiting.  Another boy in<br/>\nline told my dd that she didn&#39;t jump rope very good.  So I offered him a<br/>\nturn on the other jump rope, so he could show us how.  He refused.  Our<br/>\nlittle field trip gave us lots to talk about!<br/>\n<br/>\nLater that same day, we met at a homeschooler&#39;s house for a game of<br/>\nkickball.  There were 20 or so kids, from age 12 to 2.  The game was fun,<br/>\nand the older kids included and watched out for all the little ones who<br/>\nwanted to be part of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nGain weight... Stay Active...
