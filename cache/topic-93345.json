In every examply you used, the PARENTS were dangerous, not the swimmies.<br/>\nWhen my children are too young to swim, I am in the water with them (or another largish swimmer that can hold them), swimmies or not. Most of my children hated any kind of floatable on their body, so I held them. But those that did use some kind of flotation device still had me right there....there&#39;s no way any swimmie was dangerous on any level.<br/>\nI alternate between the kiddie pool and the big pool, holding them and being right next to them. Same thing at the beach. Swimmies aren&#39;t dangerous, people are.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n &quot;There is no way to <br/>\npeace.
