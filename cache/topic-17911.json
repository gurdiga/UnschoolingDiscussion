And how you make money <br/>\nthat way. Always looking for new ideas. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, I started out a couple years ago selling educational software that I <br/>\nbuy wholesale. Now I am branching out into collectibles. I have a friend who <br/>\ngoes to garage sales and estate auctions and buys to resale. He makes a lot <br/>\nmore than I do but he also has more free time to run auctions, it does take <br/>\ntime. For example he sells a lot of old postcards, he may spend a few dollars <br/>\nfor a whole box. A lot of them sell on ebay for $10 a piece. Some may go as <br/>\nhigh as $125 a piece. Some may not sell. But that is a nice profit. The cards <br/>\nthat sell the best are non tourist places. Like a swimming pool photo in a <br/>\nsmall town or an old school building and etc. The kind of thing where the <br/>\nbuyer says, hey, I went swimming there as a kid or Grandpa did, you get the <br/>\nidea. He also sells 70&#39;s toys. The kind he said that yuppies had as kids. <br/>\n(his words not mine). All kinds of things sell on ebay. I just sold a lot of <br/>\nbooks we had here that we had used when the kids had an interest in ancient <br/>\nhistory. But we have not used them in a long while and I decided to clean <br/>\nshelves. They sold well and many I had bought used. I made money and we used <br/>\nthem too. I make about $200 a week clear with software, if I get on the stick <br/>\nand run about 40 - 60 auctions a week. At Christmas I sell 3 times that much <br/>\nfor about 6 wks. My friend runs 175 - 200 auctions a week, I am not sure what <br/>\nhe makes but it is his only employment. He has been studying this for quite a <br/>\nwhile and knows what to buy. If you do decide to go the ebay route then you <br/>\nwill need a digital camera. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.etusa.com/auction/\">http://www.etusa.com/auction/</a> has a free program <br/>\nyou can download to set up your auctions for you so you do not have to do <br/>\nHTML which is much faster.
