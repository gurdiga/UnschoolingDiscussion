I ve been thinking about it because some people seem","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-619675655\">I&#39;ve been thinking about this whole bathing suit thing that I said or people thought I said awhile back. I&#39;ve been thinking about it because some people seem to think I&#39;m talking about size when I wasn&#39;t. And I was thinking about it because tonight on the news I see this 52 year old lady who lives in an association and wears a thong bathing suit to the pool. Some people living there have a big problem with her doing so and they are trying to take measures to make her suit up!! The condo has an attorney and she does too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow she looks not bad for 52 and certainly better than some and not as good as others. If I looked like her I wouldn&#39;t be wearing a thong. But that&#39;s me. I didn&#39;t wear one years ago when I looked better. I&#39;m on her side. No rules about it and why should she not be able to wear it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the whole bathing suit comment was made in the context of shopping and having to look at someone in a bathing suit in a place where I don&#39;t expect to see someone half dressed. At the pool and at the beach I don&#39;t sit around and mention who should be wearing what. I&#39;m at the pool or beach, a bathing suit of any kind is appropriate. I don&#39;t invite only people over to my pool that weigh in at 120 or less.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m not passing judgement on how people chose to look, just would like them to keep it where reasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74573,"nextTopicId":74606}}
