While I was sitting here reading your reply, Joyce, my son<br/>\ncame in and asked me to play &quot;multiplication war&quot;, a card game that I<br/>\nmade based on PamS&#39;s suggestion.  A good time was had by all.  My son<br/>\neven &quot;Yee-haa&#39;ed&quot; a few times when he got good cards.<br/>\n<br/>\n**There&#39;s a Dorling Kindersley book that used to be called Comparisons<br/>\nbut I<br/>\nthink has a different title now?**<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this the type of book that shows how many kangaroos stacked one on<br/>\ntop of the other it takes to reach the top of the Empire State building?<br/>\n Those can be cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love DK books, because I am seduced by the pictures.  I have to<br/>\nrealize that I&#39;m a lot more visual than my son.  When I&#39;m looking for a<br/>\ngreat math book for him, I have to tear my eyes away from the juicy<br/>\npictures and actually evaluate the text, preferably by reading it outloud.<br/>\n<br/>\n**But above all speak math.

(Maybe your daughter is only a year<br/>\nor so older than James, 8.)  He frequently asks me how long it is until<br/>\nXmas, his birthday, or Halloween.  I can &quot;show my work&quot; for him when I<br/>\ncalculate it out loud.  (For some reason, this question always comes up<br/>\nin the car, not anywhere near a calendar.)<br/>\n<br/>\n**(It&#39;s more<br/>\nmeaningful to translate 18 feet into 3 Daddy&#39;s for instance.

I don&#39;t think we will<br/>\never be doing/talking math an hour every day, unless we have another<br/>\nMonopoly marathon.<br/>\n<br/>\nJames did get to hear an explanation of percents in the car, recently. <br/>\nBut it was aimed at his dad and I don&#39;t know how much of it was<br/>\naccessible to him.  Dh and I were thinking about investments and<br/>\nspeculating about what an increase in interest rates might do to the<br/>\nstock market.  I was babbling to my dh about &quot;return on investment&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;price-earnings ratio&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59469462,"authorName":"Gerard Westenberg","from":"&quot;Gerard Westenberg&quot; &lt;westen@...&gt;","profile":"leonieann2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] was fluff / now Math","postDate":"1031439838","msgId":43265,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTcwMWMyNTZjMiRkOWI4YjQ0MCRhYjBkODY5MEBwYz4=","referencesHeader":"PEI5OUZFREUyLkNCRDglZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":43254,"nextInTopic":43266,"prevInTime":43264,"nextInTime":43266,"topicId":43235,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
