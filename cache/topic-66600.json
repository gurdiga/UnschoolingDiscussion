Especially if we went to school our whole lives and our<br/>\n parents did and so on and so on.    We&#39;ve been told what to do and when to<br/>\n do it.   We&#39;ve never just done what we&#39;ve wanted to do!   Which in turn<br/>\n never get to develop those interests.   We go from doing what we were<br/>\n supposed to do in school to-- doing what we are supposed to do in our jobs<br/>\n to--doing what we are supposed to do as a wife/mother.<br/>\n<br/>\n Its a huge jump to doing what we are interested in or living our own lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n I don&#39;t think anyone is saying that we can&#39;t take care of our families or<br/>\n children but I think there is a healthy amount of care versus a mother not<br/>\n having her own life.   I&#39;ve seen this in other Moms and I think this was me<br/>\n for a while.   Taking care of others for so long that its so hard to make<br/>\n the jump of allowing them (your children) to just be.  Allowing them to<br/>\njust<br/>\n live their lives  and  then in turn we can live our lives also.<br/>\n<br/>\n Allow and enable your children to do what they want to do; do what you like<br/>\n to do and some of the time those things will intertwine.    Its the weaving<br/>\n of our lives.   Its the flow.<br/>\n<br/>\n An example of one of our days:<br/>\n<br/>\n I get up and work at the computer,   kids get up at different times,  some<br/>\n make own breakfast, some I help.<br/>\n<br/>\n Kids watch a bit of TV,  play with animals,  play with toys/books.<br/>\n<br/>\n If we have to go into town, like today, I let them know,  so they can get<br/>\n ready.   My son will probably stay home and play his gameboy,  daughters go<br/>\n with to look at plants and get dirt for planting.    I love gardening and<br/>\nso<br/>\n do the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n Come home and start working outside on yard,  planting,   cleaning up a<br/>\nbit.<br/>\n Stop, because Kyra, 5 dd,  wants me to jump on trampoline with her.   Do<br/>\n that for a while.   Play for a while.   Other two kids join us,  then I get<br/>\n too tired to move,   so I go and plant more.<br/>\n<br/>\n I start getting hungry,  ask if anyone is hungry,  some are, some aren&#39;t.<br/>\n Some of us eat.   Go back outside to work.   Kyra is scootering,  Abbi is<br/>\n inside drawing flowers,  Alec is working at the computer looking up Pokemon<br/>\n characters and helps for his games.  Alec makes his own lunch, he likes to.<br/>\n<br/>\n Later,  a friend might come over to play, we might go for a bike ride, I<br/>\n might do my yoga,  they for sure watch their Toonami shows.   I sometimes<br/>\n watch with them, sometimes not.<br/>\n<br/>\n This evening we have some friends coming over who are going to help get a<br/>\n piano into our basement.   We&#39;ve had one in our garage for a year and we<br/>\n finally get to bring it in!!   We are all excited about that!   So,<br/>\nsometime<br/>\n today we have to get a space ready for that,   I have to move 2 full book<br/>\ncases,  ugh!    Then,  I bet we&#39;ll play the piano.<br/>\n<br/>\n A glimpse into one of our days.<br/>\n<br/>\n Kelli in MN,   and so excited that its trying to be spring here!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":144628419,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"&quot;Kelli Traaseth&quot; &lt;tktraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:&quot;Getting&quot; Unschooling and a day","postDate":"1051628151","msgId":66600,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyNGMwMWMzMGU1ZiQ2ZGM0ZWM5MCRhMjMzMTlhY0B5b3VyZ2c4N3Zxem96cT4=","referencesHeader":"PDFkOC44OGNkY2Q3LjJiZGZkMzY3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":66613,"prevInTime":66599,"nextInTime":66601,"topicId":66600,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think for lots of people this is such a difficult concept-- getting unschooling.
