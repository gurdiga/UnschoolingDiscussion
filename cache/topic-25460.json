Instead, I encouraged TV.  I rented<br/>\na lot of movies, helped find interesting programs, got cable.  For a<br/>\nsolid month we watched TV.  I served all meals in front of the TV, and I<br/>\ntalked about TV.  I bought TV related toys.  You get the idea.  It took<br/>\nabout a month until everyone was pretty sick of the TV.  I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthe TV was turned on for a couple of months after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll things seem to come in phases.  Sometimes we watch a lot and<br/>\nsometimes we watch a little and sometimes we watch none.  I think you&#39;ll<br/>\nknow when the children are ready to hear alternative suggestions.<br/>\nThey&#39;ll be antsy.<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations and good luck!  I think it is pretty freeing to give up<br/>\ncontrol.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Anderson-Thimmes<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel Wolfe Ravenhart wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been listening to the  great television debate with interest.
