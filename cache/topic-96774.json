I heard that quote directly from a nurse practitioner at our family doctor&#39;s office.  She said this after I had explained that I wanted to wait on this particular vaccine and expressed doubt about the seriousness of the illness.  She said she had personally seen very severe cases come through their office.  I don&#39;t know where you might find more specific evidence for these claims.  Although she seemed sincere and I didn&#39;t doubt she was telling the truth,  I also believe she was attempting to &quot;scare&quot; me into agreeing to have my youngest (now 8) vaccinated.  I wanted to wait in hopes that my DD would catch it naturally, as her older sister did.  But she still hasn&#39;t caught it, although she&#39;s been in public school up until last spring.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I&#39;ve heard from many, many sources that the reaction is more severe the older a child is, I may have her vaccinated one of these days ~ although I also am concerned about the info shared by others on this discussion group that the vaccine doesn&#39;t last forever, can expose and be caught by others, and that the disease can still be caught later in life.  I have heard about some catching it from shingles the elderly sometimes have.  I&#39;ve known a number of elderly people with it, and I wouldn&#39;t wish that painful & dibilitating condition on anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI subscribe to Infectious Diseases, www.infectiousdiseasenews.com, to keep an eye on the whole vaccine issue (although this publication is obviously &quot;pro&quot; vaccine).  You might find something on death or blindness linked to this vaccine in their archives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBTY, I learned something the other day from this publication that relates to the other current discussion about rabies and bats.   A recent article (see www.infectiousdiseasenews.com?200407/rabies.asp) stated that for the first time in the 50-year history of solid organ transplantation, three people have died from rabies who received organs from the same donor from Arkasas.  Eight other cases are known of people who died after cornea transplants.  Not to scare anyone.  Thousands of lives are saved every year thru organ transplantation.  Just one of the  interesting facts I learned by subscribing to this publication.  Usually every month, there is at least one article on vaccines.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helped!<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: jennefer harper <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, July 23, 2004 11:48 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] OT: Chicken Pox<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m curious, has anyone heard of any adverse<br/>\n  reactions/effects due to the Chicken Pox vaccine?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Someone recently posted:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Medical people have warned me that they <br/>\n  have seen cases come through their office of children<br/>\n  who have died or <br/>\n  been blinded by severe cases.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have never heard of anyone dying due to Chicken Pox.<br/>\n  Is there more specific evidence of this?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, I have heard of people getting a pox in their<br/>\n  eye which caused temporary blindness, but the quote<br/>\n  above seems to read permanent blindness.

But what they don&#39;t say is that these <br/>\ncomplications are all derived from acute blood toxemia established by the very <br/>\ntreatments used by allopathic physicians. So strictly speaking, all children that <br/>\ndie, do so from the allopathic medical treatments that are used to treat the <br/>\nsymptoms that accompany chicken pox. There has never been a recorded death among <br/>\nthe many thousands of children treated Hygienically, and without drugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does the CDC list as the most common complication? <br/>\n<br/>\nPneumonia and secondary bacterial infections (caused by the antibiotics). <br/>\nOther complications, according to the CDC, include encephalitis (inflamed brain <br/>\ntissue mostly from the antipyretics), hemorrhagic complications (such as <br/>\nintestinal bleeding, are the most common symptoms of aspirin-an anticoagulant, or <br/>\n&quot;blood thinner&quot;), hepatitis (congested and inflamed liver caused by the <br/>\nantipyretics), arthritis (decalcification of bone for the calcium needed to neutralize <br/>\nacidic blood, mostly caused by the aspirin), and Reye&#39;s syndrome (most <br/>\ncommonly associated with giving aspirin to children that have chicken pox or <br/>\ninfluenza). <br/>\n<br/>\nLike aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen (ie. Tylenol) <br/>\nwill also burden the liver and kidneys and check the vital actions of the body <br/>\nto discharge waste from the blood. Acetaminophen poisoning is also common <br/>\nbecause it throws the chemistry of the liver off. In fact, it is the most common <br/>\ndrug-induced cause of liver failure. It depletes hepatic glutathione, causing <br/>\nthe toxic metabolite NAPQI to fail to conjugate, which leads to hepatic injury, <br/>\nand sometimes death.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, to say that &quot;death is a complication of chicken pox&quot;, is like <br/>\nsaying, &quot;bleeding is a complication of holding a knife in your hand&quot;: each event <br/>\nis neither contingent nor a consequence of the preceding one. Their association <br/>\nis artificial; requiring specific intervening actions to take place. In cases <br/>\nof chicken pox, actions that are in accord and mandated by standard medical <br/>\npractice.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] OT: Chicken Pox","postDate":"1090616680","msgId":96775,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDcwMWM0NzBmOCRhYmMxNzg0MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzIzMTg0ODU5LjEyMDA3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjExMzAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":96774,"nextInTopic":96776,"prevInTime":96774,"nextInTime":96776,"topicId":96774,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: jennefer harper  ...
