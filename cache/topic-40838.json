My son has always had <br/>\nan interest in history from the battles/weapons/wars point of view. These <br/>\nare some of the things he&#39;s liked.<br/>\n<br/>\n*DK books are always great to check out of the library. We&#39;ve liked the ones <br/>\non Medieval times, weapons, gunships, battles, the Civil War, WWII, Native <br/>\npeoples.<br/>\n<br/>\n*We&#39;ve done trips to Air Force Base Museums and retired battleships, plus <br/>\nNatural History museums and Children&#39;s Museums.<br/>\n<br/>\n*The Dear America series of books are told journal style from the point of <br/>\nview of boys in different time periods.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Movies and videos, whether specifically meant to portray a historical event <br/>\nor not. Sometimes just seeing a different time period portrayed leads to <br/>\nquestions and answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Looking through our family stuff. We have old pictures, letters, newspaper <br/>\nclippings, memoribilia from WWII, plus that ancient historical stuff from <br/>\nwhen I was a girl. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I can think of right now. It really would depend on what time <br/>\nperiod you&#39;re looking at too.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40818,"nextTopicId":40839}}
