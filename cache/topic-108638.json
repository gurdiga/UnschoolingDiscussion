Once I could not find him in the playgroud, it&#39;s a big wooden maze place with 2 opening and I had 2 other little one&#39;s I was following around and he just got out of site. When I did locate him, he was sitting on the hill with a family right in the middle of their picnic, chatting away, asking if they lived in Davis, telling them our phone number, where we lived, the color of our house. I calmly walked over, introduced myself, and we stayed a few more minutes until Riley was finished meeting new people.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe still gravitates towards interesting groups, watches from the egde and slowly interacts.
