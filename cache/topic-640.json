So, after <br/>\nthey stopped being involved, I stayed for a while just to be with other moms. <br/>\n But their curriculum-pushing became more and more their first line of <br/>\ndiscussion and I felt more and more like an outsider.  (And in 1982 I had <br/>\nSTARTED the group for my kids to have friends and for me to have fellowship!  <br/>\nNow it&#39;s like 1,000 member families or something and has all kinds of by-laws <br/>\nand stuff, which I NEVER intended!

I do have one<br/>\n&gt;daughter who always wanted to go to college and she did and she&#39;s got a<br/>\n&gt;great job and she&#39;s happy. My husband has been trying to force our 20-yr<br/>\n&gt;old son to go to school ... he just finished his first semester which he<br/>\n&gt;flunked out. $500 wasted (it&#39;s a Tech College). <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At least it was only $500 it could have been much worse.

For some, they return home feeling<br/>\n&quot;guilty.&quot; I&#39;m also reading messages about how non-homeschool &quot;friends&quot;<br/>\nand/or family are laying the guilt trip on us or intimidating us (or our<br/>\nkids) about &quot;school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have just made the unschooling choice for my 16yo daughter; pulled her<br/>\nout of public school about a month ago. I am 44 yrs. old and she is my<br/>\nyoungest. This is all new to me and I&#39;m flying by the seat of my pants,<br/>\nbut I REFUSE to allow ANYONE to pass judgment on a decision I have made<br/>\nfor my family. When I was in my 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s it MATTERED to me what<br/>\nother people thought about me ~ my job, my kids&#39; performance, my house,<br/>\nmy husband. Now, in my 40&#39;s, I have FINALLY become so comfortable with<br/>\nmyself and who I am (I think the buzz word nowadays is &quot;authentic&quot;),<br/>\nthat I could care less what other people think. I&#39;m telling you, ladies<br/>\n~ DON&#39;T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE COMPARISON TRAP. It&#39;s deadly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t belong to a homeschool support group. There is one at our church<br/>\nwhich I have been invited to, but everyone there is homeschooling young<br/>\nones and they are all using curriculum. They don&#39;t even KNOW what<br/>\nunschooling is. What would they possibly have to offer me that I might<br/>\nneed? I can find all the encouragement or advice I need on this list or<br/>\nby surfing unschooling website or searching out a bona fide unschooling<br/>\ngroup in my area. I think a lot of homeschooling groups are made up of<br/>\nmoms and dads who are there for no other reason than to flaunt their<br/>\nchild&#39;s &quot;progress/success.&quot; People are SO into that.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t associate with people or organizations who are going to tear you<br/>\ndown. Homeschooling is so good and right for the family, that Satan is<br/>\ngoing to do everything he can to try and destroy it. Homeschooling is<br/>\nbringing families together and couples together, and it is a very<br/>\npersonal and private and ~ as Martha Stewart would say ~ It&#39;s a good<br/>\nthing!<br/>\n<br/>\nWomen, go with your instincts with your kids. How dare anyone else ~<br/>\nfamily or friend ~ secondguess your decisions/choices for your family. I<br/>\nrealize that they might love and care for you and your kids, but God<br/>\ngave those children to YOU.<br/>\n<br/>\nA second message: I agree with the remarks about college. I do have one<br/>\ndaughter who always wanted to go to college and she did and she&#39;s got a<br/>\ngreat job and she&#39;s happy. My husband has been trying to force our 20-yr<br/>\nold son to go to school ... he just finished his first semester which he<br/>\nflunked out. $500 wasted (it&#39;s a Tech College). I keep trying to tell my<br/>\nhusband that JB just isn&#39;t ready for school and he may never be ready<br/>\nfor school, but my husband believes that you have to have a college<br/>\ndegree to get a good job. Hogwash. My niece has a degree in journalism<br/>\nand has been working as a waitress in a bar for seven years; my<br/>\ngirlfriend&#39;s son has a degree in history and the only job he can find is<br/>\nas a dispatcher with a trucking firm. Duh. I wholeheartedly agree that<br/>\nthe important thing to a fulfilling life is not a job that pays well,<br/>\nbut a job in which one is happy. <br/>\n<br/>\nI worked outside the home for my church for seven years and was not<br/>\nnecessarily unhappy; but the place where I was REALLY happy was at home.<br/>\nSo I quit in January. I am LOVING being home, even though it is a<br/>\nsacrifice. It&#39;s still the best decision I ever made. Life&#39;s just too<br/>\nshort to spend the majority of my time apart from my husband and my kids<br/>\nand my grandchild.<br/>\n<br/>\nLadies ~ do your own thing!<br/>\n<br/>\nDenise, a Tea Lover in South Carolina<br/>\nStop by for a cup of tea ~ <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/sc/tealover\">http://www.angelfire.com/sc/tealover</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101986,"nextTopicId":101973}}
