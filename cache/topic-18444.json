On one hand, I think that as parents we need to be available to<br/>\nour children, but on the other hand I try not to be too child-focused or<br/>\nchild-centric. I&#39;m not sure that they need us to focus on their play, unless<br/>\nthey&#39;re asking us to play with them. Often at home, I&#39;m working on my own<br/>\nstuff or I have the kids with me while I&#39;m doing something (my passions are<br/>\nphotography and I&#39;m also training for a triathlon) and I think that&#39;s great.<br/>\nKids need to see their parents pursuing their passions and having their own<br/>\ninterests, goals, and dreams. I also try to have time available to do things<br/>\nlike crafts where they need my help and/or supervision. A lot of their play<br/>\ntime is spent alone or with each other in imaginative play and that&#39;s great<br/>\ntoo. Sometimes I feel like I&#39;ve spent too much time on my own focus and I<br/>\nneed to pull back and spend more time just hanging out with the kids.<br/>\nSometimes I feel like my own interests are getting neglected and I&#39;ve spent<br/>\ntoo much kid-time and then I need to regain some of my own focus. Always a<br/>\nbalancing act, eh? I&#39;d say go with your own intuition - if you&#39;re feeling<br/>\nlike you&#39;re not spending enough time with them (or they&#39;re showing it via<br/>\ntheir own frustration), then back off of your other activities for a while.<br/>\nIf not, carry on! I try to remember that the years when they are so young<br/>\nand needy are short and few. Soon enough they will be wanting/needing time<br/>\nto do their own thing. I try to treasure the moments I have to spend with<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ps.  I had a successful VBAC to an 8lb 15oz boy almost two years ago.
