Now I just hope I can remember it each day, <br/>\nin the rush of everything else we have planned.  I think we have too much <br/>\n&quot;stuff and activities&quot; in our life right now.  I don&#39;t know how it got this <br/>\nway.  We purposely slowed down our life a couple of years ago, when we <br/>\nstarted unschooling (you know---simplify, simplify), but somehow things are <br/>\ngetting out of control again.  It isn&#39;t so much &quot;activities&quot; as it is that <br/>\nmore and more people have &quot;needed&quot; something.  You feel like you should be <br/>\nhelping and then before you know it your life has gotten out of control as <br/>\nyou run here one night and there another.  We need to slow down and focus on <br/>\nus again.  (I don&#39;t mean that those people don&#39;t have legitimate needs.  They <br/>\ndo!  And I like helping them.  But when you help one person on Monday nights, <br/>\nanother on Tuesdays, someone else on Wednesdays, run errands or help with <br/>\nerrands for someone on Thursdays, then keep someones kids all weekend so they <br/>\ncan work---well that leaves no time for family!!  Somehow, I am going to have <br/>\nto renegotiate.
