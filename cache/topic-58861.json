And I&#39;m not<br/>\ntrying to.  I just want to explain my position.<br/>\n<br/>\nI came here a few years ago, never posted, read a lot and got angry a<br/>\nlot.  I thought we were unschooling, I had read so much for years on the<br/>\nsubject and while I had never personally met anyone who did it (still<br/>\nhaven&#39;t, by the way), I thought we were doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI unsubbed in anger a few times over the past few years, but the stuff I<br/>\nread here sunk in. I may have hated the advice (even if it wasn&#39;t<br/>\ndirected toward me) but I took most of it to heart.  Our family has<br/>\nchanged for the better, a lot due to Sandra (and Mary, and Ren, and<br/>\nJoyce, and Pam, and etc...) and I have never thanked any of them for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still get pissed sometimes when I read certain things, but I realize<br/>\nnow that I&#39;m angry for a reason.  And I think about the information<br/>\nbeing passed on to me by people who have more experience, and I&#39;m<br/>\ngrateful to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thank you to everyone who continues to put up with inflexible people<br/>\n(including me, even though I do it quietly at home and not on the<br/>\nlist).
