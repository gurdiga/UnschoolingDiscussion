It&#39;s<br/>\nactually one of those generic barbies. Her large belly<br/>\npops off and there&#39;s a baby inside (upside down). Then<br/>\nyou push on the edge of the inside of her belly (after<br/>\nthe baby&#39;s been taken out) and a new (spring loaded!),<br/>\nflat belly pops into the hole where baby came out! Oh,<br/>\nif only it were so simple. Of course, she got this in<br/>\nthe UK.
