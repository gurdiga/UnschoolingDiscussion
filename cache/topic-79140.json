She was not   amused.<br/>\nI often feel with regular school-at-home type HSers that I must not mention <br/>\nthe joys of unschooling my children, that they feel very threatened by it.One <br/>\nwoman was asking me about unschooling and kept coming back to her concern <br/>\nabout <br/>\nretaining Authority over her children. What is with this????<br/>\nI want to be an advocate for unschooling, yet am not comfortable really <br/>\ntalking about it to these other homeschoolers because it seems to freak them <br/>\nout. <br/>\nAny one else go thru this?What do you do?<br/>\nAlso, how do I get over this weird desire to buy school supplies every time <br/>\nschool rolls around?&lt;G&gt;<br/>\nNancy in BC<br/>\nI too feel at odds with the school-at-homers. Most of the people I know in <br/>\nour area are very nice, but Oh! Don&#39;t mention what you do! They look at you like <br/>\nthe lady in the boutique in Pretty Woman looked at Julia Roberts right before <br/>\nshe tells her &quot;We don&#39;t have anything here that will fit you.&quot; At 4-H the <br/>\nother night; the only other unschooler mom I know in my town and I were talking. <br/>\nAnother Mom came up and said; &quot;I am starting the Five In A Row coop up again, <br/>\nare either of you interested?&quot; The other Mom just shook her head and said no, <br/>\nbut I had to open my big mouth and say; &quot;Oh, thanks for offering, but we don&#39;t <br/>\nuse curriculums, we unschool... blah blah blah!&quot; &lt;g&gt; This lady smiled a tight <br/>\nsmile and said; &quot;Well that is why we use Five In A Row! We like the <br/>\nunschoolish leanings, you should check it out!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce, when we first started, a Mom was giving me all this advice on how you <br/>\nhave to start your day early so the kids can have breakfast eaten and dishes <br/>\ndone while you set everything up at the table. Then she said you have to make <br/>\nthe kids understand that from 9 to 3 you are NOT Mom, you are the teacher! You <br/>\nhave to get control right from the start or they will never respect you or <br/>\nbuckle down. She said and I quote; &quot;There will be days when your kids hate you, <br/>\nbut you have to keep that goal in sight at all times and having them hate you <br/>\nfor a little while is a small price to pay, besides it is good for them.&quot; I was <br/>\nin shock and had no response. She smiled and patted me on the knee. As if I <br/>\nneeded her comfort! UGH!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for buying school supplies, I still do. I love this time of the year! I <br/>\nget paper, new markers, glue, unbroken crayons... all at huge sales! I stock up. <br/>\nOur house is full of writers and artists, and when Crayola&#39;s are on sale we <br/>\nbuy! Don&#39;t look at it as back to &quot;School&quot; stuff, look at it as July and August <br/>\nare great sale months for unschoolers to get new packs of crayons and glue for <br/>\ntheir kids to make huge paper domes, airplanes, and mobiles in fusha and <br/>\nchartreuse! My kids love to go to Target and Walmart and see all the harried Moms <br/>\nand kids running around with their lists while they happily put what ever <br/>\ncatches their eye in the cart knowing that soon the park wont be so crowded. That <br/>\nsoon they wont have to share the bike trails, the man at the museum wont be so <br/>\ngrumpy and will be happy to see &quot;his favorite kids&quot; back. They love to see <br/>\nthe looks on other kids faces when chatty Mom&#39;s ask if they got the teacher they <br/>\nwanted this year, and they get to say &quot;YES! We got the best teacher of all! <br/>\nOurselves! We don&#39;t have to go to school!&quot; or their favorite, &quot;Is that all that <br/>\nis on your list this year?&quot; asked by the Mom in line behind us as our total <br/>\nis $11.62 and she knows her total is going to be something like $111.62 and my <br/>\nkids get to say, &quot;We don&#39;t know what is on our list this year, we haven&#39;t made <br/>\none yet.&quot; and then turn to me and ask if I will move some of my plants on the <br/>\nporch so they can make a fort. Because they want to bombard Dad, when he gets <br/>\nhome, with all the planes they are going to make with the paper we just <br/>\nbought. Ahh the glory of back to school sales! Revel in them, gloat in your leisure <br/>\nas you sail through the crowded aisles, picking and choosing what you will! <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nHe felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered <br/>\nwhose it was and whether they were enjoying it.<br/>\nDouglas Adams <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79142,"nextTopicId":79146}}
