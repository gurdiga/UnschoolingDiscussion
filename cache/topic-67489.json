That is the very reason she had her puppies out of <br/>\nour reach.  We are not going to try to move them.. But, now we have another <br/>\nsituation on our hands.  She abandoned one of the puppies ( not the first one <br/>\nthat she originally left in the basement), .. She moved it out from under the <br/>\nworkshop, still wet, with the cord and sack still attached.  DH cut the cord <br/>\nand put the puppy back under the workshop.. Little while later, she had moved <br/>\nhim back out.  So, evidently, she is not going to accept him.. He seems  OK.. <br/>\nstrong, able to nurse.. We brought him in, cleaned him up with a dry towel <br/>\nand got him warmed up.  We made him a bed with a hot water bottle and some <br/>\nshredded newspapers in a little box.  I went and go the pet nurser and some <br/>\npuppy milk.  We ended up putting his milk in a regular baby bottle because <br/>\nthe nipple was way too small for him.  He sucked and rooted and sucked and <br/>\nrooted.. I think he got some milk, but he still seems hungry.  Anna is <br/>\nholding him, keeping him warm.   Right now, we are hoping that when Joy comes <br/>\nout to eat, we can maybe get her to lie still long enough to nurse him for a <br/>\nwhile.   I just couldnt bring myself to let him lay out there on the ground <br/>\ncrying so loudly to die.   We already named him Siren, because when he cries, <br/>\nit sounds exactly like an Ambulance siren.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"jmcseals SEALS","from":"&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] OT..

We intended to get her spayed, <br/>\nbut, .. well, we didnt have it done in time.  At first, we were bummed <br/>\nbecause we really didn&#39;t want puppies.  The expense of getting vaccinations <br/>\nand deworming.. The hassle of trying to find good homes.   The MESS of a <br/>\nlitter of puppies... BUT, of course, the bigger Joy&#39;s belly got, the more <br/>\nexcited we got about our new additions. And, she is now scheduled to be <br/>\nspayed in June, so we won&#39;t have any more (at first) &quot;unwanted&quot; litters.<br/>\n<br/>\n   There is only one problem.  She had them under a very low floor of our <br/>\nwork shop. It&#39;s probably about an 8 inch space from the ground to the floor.  <br/>\nShe had a nice bed in the basement.    She usually stays inside(upstairs, in <br/>\nthe house with us) at night, but she made it clear she wanted OUT!..   She <br/>\ndid have one puppy in her bed in the basement, but then she went under the <br/>\nworkshop.  We found the lone puppy this morning, healthy, cleaned up, but <br/>\nobviously hungry.   He was HUGE!.. Joy is a yellow lab, I swear, the father <br/>\nmust have been a St Bernard.. lol.   Anyway, we took the puppy to her, as <br/>\nclose as we could reach.   She was wayyyy under the building.. At first, it <br/>\nwas touch and go.. She came out and sniffed him, licked him, but left him.  <br/>\nDh and I went back inside, I thought maybe she would come get the puppy if we <br/>\nleft her alone.  Dh went back out to check a few minutes later, and she had <br/>\ngotten the puppy!..   <br/>\n<br/>\nI REALLY did not want her to have them under the workshop, but I guess <br/>\n&quot;Mother knows best&quot;  .. She wanted to be safe( from our other male dog) and <br/>\nisolated..   Now, I am just dying to know how many she had, what they look <br/>\nlike, their genders..   OK, now here is where I could use some advice.  <br/>\nShould be try to get them out?  We can tear the floor up on the workshop to <br/>\nget to her, but, should be just leave her where she is?   She is usually very <br/>\nhappy indoors.. But, I suppose animal instincts precedence over domesticated <br/>\ntraits.  Any advice?<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66854,"nextTopicId":67589}}
