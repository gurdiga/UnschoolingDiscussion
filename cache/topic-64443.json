He blocked it quickly <br/>\nand quietly without hurting either of us, just stuck his arm up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought &quot;Hmmm.... that karate has really done him some good!  Worth the <br/>\nmoney!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I can still say I haven&#39;t hit Kirby since he was really little, but not <br/>\nbecause I didn&#39;t try, because he&#39;s trained to defend himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he can take people down, but hasn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery interestingly, I asked him one day if he ever sizes up a place when he <br/>\nenters to see who he could take, if things got crazy.  I asked him because a <br/>\ncouple of adult male friends had talked to me about that, and I&#39;d asked <br/>\nKeith, who said, &quot;Sure, always.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby said no.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut within one week, he had two incidents, a party and a guy on the sidewalk <br/>\noutside the store where he works.  Both times, he said he became clearly <br/>\naware of where people were, and what would be more efficient use of physical <br/>\nforce, but he only used words.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery cool.  Knowing that he COULD handle the situation physically made him <br/>\ncalm enough to be able to think of what to say to diffuse the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if I need someone big immobilized, I hope Kirby&#39;s there to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"NO","postDate":"1050160617","msgId":64444,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMS4xY2Y3NDZiNS4yYmM5ODdlOUBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":64443,"nextInTopic":64448,"prevInTime":64443,"nextInTime":64445,"topicId":64443,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/12/03 1:29:42 AM Central Daylight Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1816805609\">In a message dated 4/12/03 1:29:42 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; John Rosemond whose  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; advice shouldn&#39;t be listened to does have one really good bit - he  <br/>\n &gt; says: &quot;Strike while the iron is cold.&quot; This means that responding <br/>\n </span></blockquote> to  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; problems after-the-fact is tough - but if you plan ahead, don&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote> wait  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; until the &quot;iron is hot&quot; - the things you do when there are no <br/>\n </span></blockquote> problems  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; can help prevent problems from occurring. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think this is really, really important advice.<br/>\nI can usually sense when one child is starting to feel irritable...usually <br/>\nSierra starts to melt down and I can feed her or cuddle or something to <br/>\nprevent the build up between her an Jared.<br/>\nTrevor has a bad habit of calling names when he gets frustrated.
