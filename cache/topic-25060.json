I figured she had kids at home but it was sooooo silent that after<br/>\nawhile I thought she had simply left it on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got all the roots and wiring done and the plants all in their new little<br/>\npots and I said that she should think about getting living moss to add to<br/>\nher pots.  I gave her a list of some nurseries that would sell the moss to<br/>\nher by the chunk.  She jumped up and said she would run right down and get<br/>\nsome and said, &quot;Hold on while I get [baby&#39;s name] and I&#39;ll walk out to the<br/>\nbarn (where you had to park your car) with you.&quot;  She ran in the room with<br/>\nthe television and came back out with a baby already in a car seat.  I guess<br/>\nI had a questioning look on my face because she said, &quot;Oh, when I&#39;m busy I<br/>\npark her in front of the tv.&quot;  Poor baby had a glazed look on her face.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KathrynJB@...\">KathrynJB@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 10, 2001 12:17 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Teletubbies<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 09/10/2001 1:14:22 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe because the show is written as if children were STUPID???
