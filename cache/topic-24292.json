That<br/>\nis what is so much better about being at home, you can take the time and<br/>\nlearn from a real conversation instead of resorting to mere crowd<br/>\ncontrol.  However, if you are managing a group and give a child an<br/>\noption, it makes it easier for all than just giving a demand, and if the<br/>\nchild says &quot;neither,&quot; then they get to choose something else or discuss<br/>\nsomething else with the leader of the group.  When I talk about methods<br/>\nfor making kids mind, it is usually in response to a child who already is<br/>\nbeing rebellious, not just opinionated.  Some children will test your<br/>\nboundaries deliberately.  My children don&#39;t but I have had to be in<br/>\ncharge of other children who do, some by outright defiance.  For example,<br/>\nif you have a child who is breaking things, you had better show them that<br/>\nthey do not have the liberty to do that or they will continue to do so. <br/>\nThey are crying out for some attention, for someone to give them a safe<br/>\nboundary.  And once they are shown that you mean business, they stop and<br/>\ntreat you with respect.  But what I said was something that happens in<br/>\nps, in response to people talking about yelling or spanking, etc. <br/>\nPersonally, I think if there are behavior challenges, it is usually<br/>\nbecause someone isn&#39;t being listened to, or allowed to just &quot;be&quot;, or<br/>\ngiven enough real interaction, or fatigue or hunger, or boredom.  When I<br/>\nget in the middle of a room and say, &quot;Let&#39;s clean up together&quot; or we go<br/>\nin the kitchen and everyone does their part together to wash, dry, put<br/>\naway, we have a great talk while we work together and it is fun.  <br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bridget E Coffman","from":"Bridget E Coffman &lt;rumpleteasermom@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"5EYFvq7bfAD-dtVaMSCZQmFH5ZOdnNbb_3gYyZ2Y9Xlh1o_oiN_UCwpGkpV9adZKvBL9QhEx_OF5fxphT_Z8RoVT3i6KTi7sIkNup32sDoXYYdA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1414","postDate":"999820064","msgId":24296,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTA2LjE5NTA1MC4tNzU1Nzc5LjExLnJ1bXBsZXRlYXNlcm1vbUBqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24295,"nextInTopic":24450,"prevInTime":24295,"nextInTime":24297,"topicId":24292,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Put the apple in trash or get in <br/>\ntrouble.Right. Reminds me of the 123 concept. Count to 3 then what? The child <br/>\npushes to 3 then gets in trouble. Not very productive or empowering. Working <br/>\ntogether to solve issues empowers them for their future interactions w/ <br/>\nothers. Would you tell your dh to throw out the apple or sit on the sofa? No <br/>\nI&#39;d ask dh to please throw away his garbage to help me out. I do not have my <br/>\ndd do chores.
