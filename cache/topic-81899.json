It<br/>\n&gt; could be hazardous to other drivers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last week I was listening to Morning Edition on National<br/>\n&gt; Public Radio (NPR) while driving to work. And when I heard<br/>\n&gt; the beginning of a report on the use of medication to treat<br/>\n&gt; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), I should<br/>\n&gt; have pulled over to the shoulder of the road and turned off<br/>\n&gt; the car so that I could talk back (shout back!) to the radio<br/>\n&gt; without endangering my fellow motorists.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m happy to say that I got to work without plowing my car<br/>\n&gt; into anyone else. That&#39;s the good news. The bad news: Even<br/>\n&gt; though hundreds of thousands of children are being given<br/>\n&gt; pharmaceuticals to treat ADHD, there are &quot;experts&quot; out there<br/>\n&gt; who are convinced that our kids are under-medicated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now aren&#39;t you glad you weren&#39;t driving a car when you read<br/>\n&gt; that last sentence?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Dreaming up diseases<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The NPR report was part of a series on mental illness in<br/>\n&gt; children. But does ADHD really qualify as a mental illness?<br/>\n&gt; In the most extreme cases, possibly. But I wholeheartedly<br/>\n&gt; agree with a Brandeis University medical sociologist named<br/>\n&gt; Peter Conrad who told NPR that the American medical<br/>\n&gt; establishment has come to regard normal human differences as<br/>\n&gt; medical problems - such as judging a child to have a disease<br/>\n&gt; because he doesn&#39;t pay as close attention as the kid in the<br/>\n&gt; next desk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And you know what we do with a disease in this country: We<br/>\n&gt; medicate it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In direct counterpoint to Mr. Conrad&#39;s clear thinking, the<br/>\n&gt; NPR piece also featured Columbia University psychiatrist<br/>\n&gt; Peter Jensen who believes that only half the kids with ADHD<br/>\n&gt; are being properly medicated. So if Mr. Jensen had his way,<br/>\n&gt; the number of U.S. kids taking an ADHD medication would<br/>\n&gt; roughly equal the entire population of Ireland. That&#39;s well<br/>\n&gt; over 3 million.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mr. Jensen is particularly pleased with a National Institutes<br/>\n&gt; of Mental Health (NIMH) study that compared the effectiveness<br/>\n&gt; of behavior modification to medication in treating ADHD. The<br/>\n&gt; behavior modification proved to be useful, but medication was<br/>\n&gt; found to be more effective. Case closed, says Mr. Jensen.<br/>\n&gt; Time to medicate those 1.5+ million stragglers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But psychologist William Pelham says, not so fast. Both<br/>\n&gt; Pelham and Jensen participated in the NIMH study, and Mr.<br/>\n&gt; Pelham points out that other studies (ones that didn&#39;t simply<br/>\n&gt; compare a behavior modification group to a medication group)<br/>\n&gt; have found that more than half of ADHD subjects may be<br/>\n&gt; successfully treated with behavior modification alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No doubt, the concept of trying behavior modification before<br/>\n&gt; resorting to drugs is going to be a hard sell to the medical<br/>\n&gt; establishment. But there&#39;s still a critical element missing<br/>\n&gt; from both of these treatment options.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Oh behave!<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The behavior modification techniques described in the NPR<br/>\n&gt; report don&#39;t include diet modification. And that&#39;s a huge<br/>\n&gt; omission.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the e-Alert &quot;How to Dismantle an &#39;89 Ford&quot; (6/3/02), HSI<br/>\n&gt; Panelist Allan Spreen, M.D., told us how he had successfully<br/>\n&gt; treated hyperactive children with a two-step process: 1) by<br/>\n&gt; discovering and removing food allergies, and 2) by enhancing<br/>\n&gt; nutrition. The drawback to this process is that it&#39;s more<br/>\n&gt; difficult to strictly modify a child&#39;s diet than it is to<br/>\n&gt; have a prescription filled. And dietary changes take time. A<br/>\n&gt; pill is a quick fix. But that quick fix comes with possible<br/>\n&gt; side effects as well as long-range problems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the June 2002 e-Alert, Dr. Spreen wrote: &quot;It&#39;s amazing how<br/>\n&gt; many hyperactive children are chemically sensitive. The trick<br/>\n&gt; is finding out what the sensitivity is. Food allergies are<br/>\n&gt; chemical sensitivities, and they must be ruled out first.<br/>\n&gt; This starts by cutting out the historic offenders - milk (or<br/>\n&gt; other dairy), wheat, corn, soy, peanut, and adding to the<br/>\n&gt; list anything (ANYTHING) that the child craves (or just<br/>\n&gt; insists on eating everyday).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Bear in mind also that sugar is a chemical. It&#39;s purified<br/>\n&gt; and concentrated to a point w-a-a-a-y beyond what our bodies<br/>\n&gt; were genetically designed to comfortably handle, and blood<br/>\n&gt; sugar swings resulting from its use can absolutely have an<br/>\n&gt; impact on behavior. Improvement can be absolutely amazing,<br/>\n&gt; and then maddening to discover that so much control was<br/>\n&gt; available from within the refrigerator.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Add nutrients<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Once a child&#39;s diet is purged of aggravating factors, there<br/>\n&gt; are important nutrients that can help calm hyperactivity. Dr.<br/>\n&gt; Spreen recommends vitamin C in high doses (a &quot;great<br/>\n&gt; detoxifier&quot;) as well as alpha lipoic acid; used in<br/>\n&gt; conjunction with a good basic multi-vitamin/mineral regimen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dr. Spreen adds, &quot;Most ADHD kids have deficient diets, and<br/>\n&gt; essential fatty acids (important for proper nerve formation<br/>\n&gt; and conduction) are often undersupplied. Fish oil<br/>\n&gt; supplements, along with extra vitamin E to assist in its<br/>\n&gt; metabolism, can be very helpful. Sometimes, magnesium (in<br/>\n&gt; doses not high enough to loosen stools) can be a big calmer<br/>\n&gt; in the mineral department, and certain amino acid-type<br/>\n&gt; supplements like GABA and L-tryptophan can be amazingly<br/>\n&gt; effective. However, get educated by starting at the<br/>\n&gt; beginning and don&#39;t quit until you have the answer.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Option one<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The NPR report quotes a Johns Hopkins psychiatrist named<br/>\n&gt; Daniel Safer who notes that over many years of treating<br/>\n&gt; children with ADHD he&#39;s seen the attitude of parents change.<br/>\n&gt; Where parents were once cautious about medicating their<br/>\n&gt; children, many are now quite willing to request a<br/>\n&gt; prescription for Ritalin. Several factors have contributed to<br/>\n&gt; this change in attitude. In 1991, for instance, the U.S.<br/>\n&gt; Office of Education officially identified ADHD as a condition<br/>\n&gt; qualifying a child for special education. And there&#39;s no<br/>\n&gt; doubt that the direct advertising of prescription drugs has<br/>\n&gt; made our culture much more comfortable with the idea of<br/>\n&gt; solving problems with pharmaceuticals.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And now there&#39;s a new drug that&#39;s making the decision to<br/>\n&gt; medicate just that much easier. Strattera is a non-stimulant<br/>\n&gt; ADHD medication introduced by Eli Lilly less than a year ago.<br/>\n&gt; And it&#39;s selling like gangbusters. One million prescriptions<br/>\n&gt; for Strattera were written between November 2002 and June<br/>\n&gt; 2003. The fact that Lilly can back up a new product with a<br/>\n&gt; formidable international marketing effort has a lot to do<br/>\n&gt; with these huge sales. But an ADHD drug that doesn&#39;t mimic<br/>\n&gt; amphetamines (as Ritalin does) is probably very attractive to<br/>\n&gt; parents.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But is it safer? That&#39;s hard to answer. Like Ritalin, the<br/>\n&gt; long-range effects of Strattera are still a question mark.<br/>\n&gt; And Strattera&#39;s most common side effects (mood swings,<br/>\n&gt; dizziness, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and<br/>\n&gt; tiredness) read like the symptoms of a disease. Does that<br/>\n&gt; sound like the best way to help kids get focused?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dr. Spreen sums up the ADHD situation with this<br/>\n&gt; comment: &quot;Never assume that drugs are the only answer.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I would add to that: As effective as it may be in<br/>\n&gt; treating ADHD, behavior modification isn&#39;t complete without<br/>\n&gt; modification of the diet as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **************************************************************<br/>\n&gt;                           HAD ENOUGH<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Are you sick of eating turkey burgers and sprouts...  sick of<br/>\n&gt; forcing gallons of water down your throat... sick of<br/>\n&gt; exercising until you can hardly breathe?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Before you give up everything just because &quot;everyone&quot; says<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s healthy...
