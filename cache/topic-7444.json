I live in New <br/>\nJersey a very homeschool friendly state. I home/unschool my 3 children and <br/>\nmy mother-in-law(she had my husband at 17- two of our kids are the same age- <br/>\nodd...) homeschools her last three(of seven).<br/>\nShe is also homeschooling a 6 year old boy whose mom is a friend of hers. <br/>\nShe would probably say &quot;Don&#39;t do it!&quot;. She has run into all kinds of <br/>\nproblems from him monopolizing all her time to his mother giving her wacky <br/>\ncurriculum that her son is no where near ready for. Not to mention the fact <br/>\nthat he puts a serious crimp in her families homeschool style and flow when <br/>\nhe is there (three days a week).<br/>\nIt&#39;s a big chore and should REALLY be thought about before undertaking.<br/>\n        We also have a great co-op down here. It meets only one day a week <br/>\nin five week sessions. We have 25 families and need a large facility to meet <br/>\nin. The kids are divided into groups from nursery on up to 7th-12th grade. <br/>\nThe moms volunteer class ideas and then teach them. We go from 9:30 to 11:45 <br/>\nthen we all have lunch. Some of the 7th-12th classes have been frog <br/>\ndissection,crime science and inventions. The kids have a great time, and the <br/>\nparents have fun too.We just started this in September and it&#39;s went really <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n   Oh well just my two cents!<br/>\n                  Kimberly<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"HSMOTGO@aol.com","from":"HSMOTGO@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"XUhqH_PsxRSU73Qdsa9o-tUC73Y5-SmuPPtbP3Bn--iXNn-13ztOU0JjGhGIRwKQ4QXWkHyu","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling kids that are not yours","postDate":"954373989","msgId":7444,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJjLjMxMGYxNGMuMjYxM2YxNjVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7455,"prevInTime":7443,"nextInTime":7445,"topicId":7444,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Karen, I have been asked, but in Fla. you cannot homeschool anyone else s kids but your own.
