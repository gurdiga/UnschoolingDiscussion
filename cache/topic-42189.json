Letting our friends and family<br/>\nknow what morons they are for having thier children in there? Or for<br/>\nteaching in there?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a good point. My 80 year old mom, who sent 6 children through the <br/>\nschool system, has become a very vocal unschooling advocate in the <br/>\nretirement home she lives in. &lt;g&gt; She tells me that the other old ladies are <br/>\namazed and really quite interested when she tells them how her grandchildren <br/>\nare learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so proud of my mom for having such an open mind. Just as she is proud of <br/>\nme for being such an involved parent with her grandchildren. I don&#39;t think <br/>\nwe would ever have gotten to this place of understanding though, if she <br/>\nthought I was constantly being critical of the choices she made as far as <br/>\nschooling goes. Or even the choices my siblings made with her other <br/>\ngrandchildren. They did the best they could. If I had been trying to educate <br/>\nher on how bad school is, rather than how great our unschooling life is, she <br/>\nwould have put up a wall. Not everyone would react that way, but I know my <br/>\nmom would have.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m now hoping to show the next generation (the grandchildren, <br/>\ngreat-grandchildren...and their parents) a better way to learn. And I&#39;ve got <br/>\ntheir 80 year old Grandma out there talking up the joys of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42182,"nextTopicId":42192}}
