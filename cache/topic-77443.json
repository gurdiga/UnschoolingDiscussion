My ten year old travelled to twenty six states last year (talk about a learning opportunity!) She drove with us to Florida and drove with my mom and dad to NM to see our family. She couldn&#39;t believe the different climates. She had to plan and pack for all different weather scenarios. This is really my dh and my dream for our family, to get his musical career going enough to just be travelling a lot. The kids love it and it really is SO eye opening to see the different cultures and climates ect. I still love NM more though, it&#39;s where my family is:) Kelli<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\nIn a message dated 7/23/03 7:46:20 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kellibac@...\">kellibac@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Ugh, another muggy day in the east coast, I miss that dry weather in NM <br/>\nSandra, I feel like we live in a jungle!  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda was surprised that it rained hard enough at the airport to delay her <br/>\nflight&#39;s departure, but it didn&#39;t rain at my house.
