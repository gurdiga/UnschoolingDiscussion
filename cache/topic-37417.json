I was reading about a Korean Christian that told about her mother keeping a journal on each of her eight children.

At the end of the month the child could read what mother had observed and written for that month.  She said it was such an exciting time at the end of the month to get to read it.  Mother never put in the negative things or failures of any kind.

I have a kid who tends to think he&#39;s not good at a lot of things <br/>\n(other than sports).  He gets a lot of positive strokes about his athletic <br/>\nsuccesses.
