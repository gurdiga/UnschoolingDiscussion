I not only have problems about their inclusivity, but also that it<br/>\nlooks a heckuva lot like school these days.  It used to be that cubs were<br/>\ngrades 2-4, webaloes 5, and boy scouts 6-12.  Now (at least here...), the<br/>\ncub scouts meet together once a month, but for weekly meetings, it&#39;s tigers<br/>\nin 1st grade, wolves in 2nd grade, bears in 3rd grade, etc.  Being not<br/>\noverly fond of the school model, that doesn&#39;t thrill me.  Part of the appeal<br/>\nof scouting when I was a girl scout was having the older girls help me do<br/>\nstuff and looking forward to when *I* was one of the older girls.
