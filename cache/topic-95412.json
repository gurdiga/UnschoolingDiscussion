They look for resources for &quot;early immersion Spanish&quot; or take<br/>\nclasses, seek out teachable moments, or insist that their children must do a<br/>\ncertain amount of various subjects before playing. I hear the conversations<br/>\nalthough I don&#39;t usually participate in them. The parents strive to make it<br/>\n&quot;more interesting&quot; and sometimes even use (gasp!) videos as part of some<br/>\nunit studies. These are 3 and 4 and 5 year olds. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey talk about how they did &quot;The Food Pyramid&quot; (as if there were only one)<br/>\nso that they could explain why their parental food controls were right. They<br/>\ngenuinely delight in how much fun the kids had cutting out little pictures<br/>\nof fruit etc and sticking them on some chart they downloaded. (Jayn has not<br/>\nshown the slightest interest in this type of activity so far - she likes to<br/>\ncut out paper dolls, snowflakes or geometric shapes for use in collages.) <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is plenty of talk about how much enjoyment their child gets from the<br/>\nwhatever Unit they are doing, and how &quot;We have to stop or she&#39;d want to<br/>\nlearn ALL the State capitols in ONE DAY!&quot; I always say, &quot;So, why stop?&quot; The<br/>\nanswers are always either along the lines of some other commitment coming up<br/>\nin the next half hour, or parental exhaustion. There is always a sense of<br/>\nenvy (not from me!) for those parents whose children love to do workbooks<br/>\nfrom the &quot;unlucky&quot; ones whose children resist the things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve only ever had one (new to our group) parent actually say, &quot;But you&#39;ll<br/>\nuse a Curriculum *later* won&#39;t you - when you *need* one?&quot; Answer (with<br/>\nhidden evil grin): &quot;No - I&#39;m a Radical Unschooler. I can&#39;t see us ever using<br/>\na curriculum.&quot; &quot;Oh&quot;. Then parent literally, and I mean literally, turned and<br/>\nstrode briskly away, to another little knot of parents, and hasn&#39;t spoken to<br/>\nme since. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the children go, when the homeschoolers are all playing together<br/>\nat the park, it is impossible to tell which ones use Abeka or Sonlight or<br/>\nwhatever (names I have heard but know nothing about) from the Unit studiers<br/>\nor Jayn. It is only when they start to interact with their own parents that<br/>\ndifferences in parenting become discernible. There are quite a few parents<br/>\nwho are ready to jump in with &quot;Did you say Thank you for that cracker?&quot;.<br/>\nThere are sometimes: &quot;Can we go to Sophia&#39;s tomorrow?&quot; &quot;We have to finish<br/>\nour school work first&quot;; and the occasional inexplicable &quot;May I take off my<br/>\nsweater?&quot; &quot;No&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is those moments that remind me with a jolt that I am an Unschooler with<br/>\na whole different mind set.

My 7 yo dd (whom I call Odette online) has been fascinated with<br/>\nghosts for the past few months, inspired by seeing the ballet &quot;Giselle&quot; and<br/>\na visit to the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose (which is thought to be<br/>\nhaunted).  Ever since, she&#39;s been reading every ghost-related book she can<br/>\nget her hands on, and practices her ghost-hunting skills regularly.  : )<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, she read about a ghost-related workshop that she wants to attend,<br/>\nwhich has now inspired her to *teach* a ghost-hunting class for kids.  She<br/>\nhas picked a date, has been thinking about what she plans to cover, made a<br/>\nflyer about the class, and is ready to distribute them.  : )  Very<br/>\ncool...except...many parents are not comfortable with this topic.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to inhibit her initiative at all, but I also realize that she might<br/>\nreceive some unexpected/negative responses.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my question for you all is:  Would it be more supportive to talk with<br/>\nher about people&#39;s varied beliefs regarding ghosts in advance or wait and<br/>\nsee what happens?<br/>\n<br/>\nTiffany<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tiftan@...\">tiftan@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Can unschooling be unschooled?
