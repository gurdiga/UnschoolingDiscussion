I&#39;m Tracy, my children are 5 and nearly-<br/>\n4yo, and I live in Yorkshire.  As far as tackling <br/>\ndifferent subjects and planning materials goes, well I <br/>\ndon&#39;t.  For me, unschooling is about living and not <br/>\nthinking too much about learning this or that in any <br/>\nparticular order or way.  I trust my children to learn <br/>\nwhat they need to when they need to.  Now, this can be <br/>\nvery difficult to get one&#39;s head round, most of us <br/>\n(about 99% I think!) have been brought up at least <br/>\nnominally, even if folk skived as much as me, within <br/>\nthe institutional school system.  So it&#39;s kind-of hard <br/>\nnot to think about maths or science or English and just <br/>\nget on with what we want to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there will be others more eloquent than me who <br/>\ncan describe unschooling, in all its myriad forms.

I homeschool our three boys who are: almost nine, six and<br/>\na half, and almost four.  My little one has Down syndrome and finding<br/>\nmaterials and ideas has been a challenge.  I would like to know if anyone<br/>\non this list has experience homeschooling a special needs child.  We are<br/>\ncurrently what you would call &quot;relaxed&quot; homeschoolers.  I really want to<br/>\nlearn more about unschooling and how you do it.  I would really like to get<br/>\nrid of all the &quot;busy work&quot; but don&#39;t really understand what to replace it<br/>\nwith.  I&#39;m sorry to appear so naive but I really do want to change our<br/>\nmethods at home and need some help to do it.  We have an organic garden out<br/>\nback which the children have really enjoyed planting, picking and eating in<br/>\naddition to observing all kinds of insects and caterpillars.  We got to see<br/>\nthe complete cycle of the Black Swallowtail butterfly just by observation<br/>\nin our own little backyard, that was pretty neat!  The back of our house<br/>\nhas a little woods behind it and we saw a beautiful red fox the other day<br/>\nright at the back of our fence.  I think he wanted to eat the rabbit!  I<br/>\nhave the Charlotte Mason series and like her ideas.  I just bought Simply<br/>\nGrammar to do with my two eldest.  My six year old just finished all his<br/>\nbooks he was doing in his language arts program and I was looking for<br/>\nsomething to teach him that didn&#39;t include doing all that book work.  I<br/>\nwould appreciate any ideas you might have.  Both my older boys are<br/>\nvoracious readers and read several grade levels higher than their age.  I<br/>\nam currently looking at materials for next year ( I like to plan ahead) and<br/>\nwould like to know what all you guys use to teach different subjects.<br/>\nRoni</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14267,"nextTopicId":14276}}
