I no longer think of pink poodles when I hear FiFi ( Feefee) but <br/>\nit actualy fits our Ethan quite well, too!  He&#39;s got the sassy attitude and <br/>\ncharm as well.  And these beautiful long eyelashes and sparkling brown eyes <br/>\nto match!  For a little boy who couldn&#39;t be any more BOY, he&#39;s also a <br/>\nprancer and just bounces on air when he walks.  Maybe a male French <br/>\nPoodle??? LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best friend has three kids and calls them poopers, bobo and teetee.  They <br/>\nstarted out as Carly-Poo, Adam-Bo-Badum and Leah-Weah.  Leah&#39;s eventually <br/>\nbecame we-we, then progressed on to teetee.  Don&#39;t ask me why but those all <br/>\nstuck and I figure I&#39;ll tell Ethan it could be worse! Haha!<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;My DD Fiona is often called &quot;Fifi&quot;.  When she was first born my DS (then<br/>\n&gt;2) crowned her Princess Fiona / Fifi.  I thought I&#39;d totally hate having<br/>\n&gt;a Fifi (because of the French poodle thing;) but she totally wears the<br/>\n&gt;name.  She&#39;s got this great sassy attitude and tons charm to pull it<br/>\n&gt;off.  She&#39;s definitely a Fifi.  ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;TreeGoddess<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\">http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64847,"nextTopicId":64859}}
