I&#39;m not doing the homeschooling after divorce thing <br/>\nnow, but I did for a while.  I think my situation was probably so different <br/>\nthat it wouldn&#39;t be much help to you.  I pulled my son out long after we <br/>\nwere divorced.  After a year and a half, he threatened me with court if I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t put Noah back in school.  Being 8 months pregnant with Lars and <br/>\nknowing that Noah wanted all the fighting to end, I caved.  One thing I <br/>\nfound out during that period was that in BC anyway, joint guardianship <br/>\ngives both parents a say in educational matters.
