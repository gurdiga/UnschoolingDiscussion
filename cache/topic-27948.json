Gain a pound or<br/>\n&gt; two?  Have an upset tummy for a while?  When a person with an allergy<br/>\n&gt; (non-lifethreatening allergy) binges, the consequences are<br/>\n&gt; different.  And they can vary amongst alergic people too.  When I<br/>\n&gt; binge, I wheeze and have to up my asthma meds.  When Rachel binges,<br/>\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t kill her, she just wishes it would.  She gets killer<br/>\n&gt; headaches from her allergies, along with skin problems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Had I never forced her to stop eating certain foods she never would<br/>\n&gt; have made the connection between the foods and the headaches because<br/>\n&gt; the headaches were constant.  That&#39;s the problem with allergies to<br/>\n&gt; common foods.  If you are eating it everyday, you don&#39;t see the<br/>\n&gt; changes because there aren&#39;t any, you are just miserable. And the<br/>\n&gt; fact that you crave what you are addicted to (thanks Doc P for that<br/>\n&gt; lesson) doesn&#39;t help matters at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But the flipside of the control issue and the part I think YOU of all<br/>\n&gt; people should understand is that once the person has been given the<br/>\n&gt; chance to learn the reactions and learn the reasons, they should be<br/>\n&gt; given back the choices about their own foods intake at some point<br/>\n&gt; before they are a teen.  We can&#39;t control what they eat forever so we<br/>\n&gt; need to help them learn to do then let them do it for themselves.  At<br/>\n&gt; least that&#39;s how we handled it here.

When my mother<br/>\n&gt;made cookies, they had to last because we didn&#39;t have the money to make them<br/>\n&gt;everyday.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is what it was like in my family, only it wasn&#39;t a lack of money.  My <br/>\nmother felt that junk food was for once in a while, and that&#39;s how often we <br/>\ngot it.  I was told that if I wanted white bread or breakfast candy, I <br/>\ncould spend my allowance on them.  I did.  Once each.  (I did buy candy <br/>\nbars with my allowance, but was more likely to spend it on comics.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I never felt like I was deprived.  I didn&#39;t run out and buy whitebread when<br/>\n&gt;I got married.  I didn&#39;t binge on candy or soda then or now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I still don&#39;t buy white bread and rarely soda.  It&#39;s a big yuck for me.  I <br/>\ndo binge on other things.  It has nothing to do with deprivation and <br/>\neverything to do with the low self-esteem I acquired in school.  That and a <br/>\ndoctor who told me to lose 20 pounds when I was 12.  Years later, I <br/>\nrealized that I was actually at my ideal weight when he told me that.  (And <br/>\nI&#39;d love to get back to that now.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Were there other things going on that have caused folks to react this way?<br/>\n&gt;Or could it be that if it wasn&#39;t the sodas or the candy, it would have been<br/>\n&gt;something else.  Or could it be that even if there weren&#39;t controlling<br/>\n&gt;parents, some other sort of issues would have occured in their life anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See above.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Maybe it isn&#39;t about how a child&#39;s life was controlled but how they<br/>\n&gt;subconsciously choose to view themselves?  Maybe because as children they<br/>\n&gt;couldn&#39;t see that it wasn&#39;t all about them but really about their parents<br/>\n&gt;and their parents issues?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It wasn&#39;t even my parents.  It was other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Am I clear as mud as usual?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As usual.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nTia Leschke   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island<br/>\n**************************************************************************<br/>\nIt is the answers which separate us, the questions which unite us. - Janice <br/>\nLevy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bridget","from":"&quot;Bridget&quot; &lt;rumpleteasermom@...&gt;","profile":"rumpleteasermom","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"F5dYjE0bzxo538m_HudMVd8Qq_3IPjfev01LofVI1LgY7Pb2369P2Uwlcy7VvsSB4AtVtfNRGoqDuUZzdosu8UmdcflYopmnHzi0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Allergies and Bingeing","postDate":"1006276316","msgId":28097,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDl0ZTJzcyt2bG45QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDExMTIwLjEwMDE0MC4tMjczNDU1LjEuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":28095,"nextInTopic":28107,"prevInTime":28096,"nextInTime":28098,"topicId":27948,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I guess that s where the craving factor plays a big part.

When I <br/>\nbinge, I wheeze and have to up my asthma meds.  When Rachel binges, <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t kill her, she just wishes it would.

Mine was gone in three days; hers was mostly there in three weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s because when I was a kid candy was rare, and counted (four <br/>\nkids--things were divided by four all the time).  I looked forward to being <br/>\nold enough to have it when I wanted it, or looked forward to having enough <br/>\nmoney to buy my own.  My kids don&#39;t spend money on candy; it&#39;s free at the <br/>\nhouse to them.  With six people in the family, if we had donuts, that was two <br/>\napiece.

But didn&#39;t tell me directly (because it <br/>\nwould have gone over like a lead balloon), and hoped I would &quot;respect their <br/>\nwishes&quot; as conveyed by a kid reciting rules.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTheir house&#39;s rules stop around the edge of their yard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t expect any other family to give my kids the freedoms and regard and <br/>\nprivileges they have at my house.  If they go to another house with rules <br/>\nabout where and what and how and how much, fine!  It&#39;s not my house.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-K- Maybe they aren&#39;t aware of that your rules come before theirs, or <br/>\nthat there&#39;s any difference. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not running a drop in daycare center.

They wouldn&#39;t even have to beg.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I have told my kids when they <br/>\nasked how I felt about my time at school. That may have<br/>\ninfluenced them some, for better or worse. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI told them I really loved it, but that most people don&#39;t.  They all have <br/>\nfriends in school.

We graze<br/>\nalot.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWe take requests. They can go shopping if they want.   Every time my husband <br/>\nor I go to the store we ask each other and kids if there&#39;s anything they <br/>\nneed.  Kirby usually requests shampoo or toiletries.  Holly asks for <br/>\nvegetables and fruit.  Marty often says  nothing, or pizza, or avocados or <br/>\nchips.  Mostly they say nothing, but there&#39;s usually food.  If Holly runs out <br/>\nof Ramen she wants more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot of grazing, frequent casserole or crock pot stuff that&#39;s there <br/>\nfor whenever people come by, homemade bread that&#39;s for whoever wants it <br/>\nwhenever. Breakfast is the most likely formal deal (especially with company). <br/>\n  Holly likes to help cook, but never lasts the whole course.  Very often one <br/>\nperson will cook for the one or two others around at the moment.

I know that people don&#39;t<br/>\nalways want help, but saying what works for us has given other people <br/>\nfreedom to consider new possibilities. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; k&quot;-=-Many parents have said that their allergic kids feel deprived and <br/>\n&gt; binge, others say their kids understand and feel good about taking <br/>\n&gt; care <br/>\n&gt; of themselves. The bingeing may have more to do with addiction than <br/>\n&gt; with <br/>\n&gt; social deprivation. -=-&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>S-&quot;&gt; By this logic, any teen or adult who rejects the parental <br/>\nrestrictions when <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; freedom hits and goes ahead and eats wheat or sugar has proven the parent <br/>\n&gt; right!  The child WAS an addict, proving that by not continuing the food ban <br/>\n&gt; for life?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>K- What if the parent was right? What if the parent was wrong? If they <br/>\nwere right the child may bee in good physical health and really notice <br/>\nthat the binge made them ill. If they were wrong the child could learn <br/>\nthat it was not a problem after all. I guess you&#39;re upset that the <br/>\nchild lost all those years of making their own decisions. I agree with <br/>\nthat, yet I feel conflict about health and freedom. I don&#39;t think they <br/>\nhave to be mutually exclusive, yet I am sure the balance is possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you disagreeing with the idea of addiction? I don&#39;t really know <br/>\nwhat I think of addiction. I am still asking lots of<br/>\nquestions. There are so many other issues that come up when anyone <br/>\ntalks about binge foods- self control, will power, stress,<br/>\nsocial pressure. They are related but how can people stop binges? <br/>\nSomeone here said that they kept some of the foods in the<br/>\nhouse and that stopped the bingeing at friends&#39; houses. So far for us, <br/>\nwe just binge here instead if I do buy the foods. I am not<br/>\ntrying to fight with anyone. I am really asking 600 people if they have <br/>\nany other thoughts on the subject besides that it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhappen to sensible people. This is not a food disorders list, I know <br/>\nthat. It is a list of curious people though, who don&#39;t always<br/>\nfollow society&#39;s line, and do find their own answers. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=-Why are the things that are the worst <br/>\n&gt; for us considered treats?-=- <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>S-&quot;&gt; I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s true.  There are traditional seasonal or <br/>\nholiday <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; foods that are not the worst-for-us foods.  It&#39;s rarity that makes a treat, <br/>\n&gt; not bodily damage.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess I am using the word treat the way I hear it used most often. <br/>\n&quot;Treat yourself to dessert (daily), have a treat at the store (candy), <br/>\nbuy a treat at the movies&quot;, all over the place every day, as if you&#39;re <br/>\nnot normal if you avoid that stuff. If treat only meant rarity that <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be a problem. It&#39;s the on going bombardment of junk foods at <br/>\nevery house,<br/>\nhalloween/easter/christmas/valentine&#39;s candy that is passed out all <br/>\nover the place, the high fat/sugar/salt diet that is most people&#39;s<br/>\nidea if regular food. The idea that to avoid this kind of food is <br/>\nunnatural and bad. I&#39;m trying to keep the kids healthy enough to<br/>\nlearn the difference. If you&#39;re constantly in a drugged state, you <br/>\nwon&#39;t notice it, but if you are fine until you have the cake and ice<br/>\ncream, you&#39;ll learn the connection. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>S-&quot;&gt; Without options, a child cannot learn to &quot;develop their own <br/>\nchoices.&quot;  If the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; foods are highly restricted, some children will choose to be sneaky or eat <br/>\n&gt; elsewhere.  They can&#39;t choose fruit over cake if there was no cake available.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>K- I guess that I don&#39;t highly restrict foods. I don&#39;t buy things that <br/>\nare junk because they&#39;re just not food. They are treats that can<br/>\nbe had once in awhile, but not every day, every week. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids turn down junk sometimes, or just have a little. Not because <br/>\nI&#39;m hovering over them with a whip, but because they eat<br/>\nwhatever they want most of the time. I haven&#39;t made any food evil or <br/>\nforbidden, just I try not to buy stuff that makes us sick. Is<br/>\nthat nuts? I really am still learning about all this food stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you or your own children have never binged, how do you know what&#39;s <br/>\nthe right thing to do about it? I don&#39;t know myself. <br/>\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nS-&quot;&gt; A child can&#39;t clean his room by his own choice (as Marty did a few <br/>\nweeks <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; back--big reorganization) if room cleaning is mandated.  If it is mandated on <br/>\n&gt; a schedule, the child can ONLY &quot;choose&quot; by choosing not to cooperate. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband&#39;s family of origin set up that kind of &quot;choice&quot;--the &quot;my way or <br/>\n&gt; the highway&quot; scenario.   We have in full knowledge of our intent set out <br/>\n&gt; never to do that to our kids.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;K-&quot; -=-I think that the best person to determine what freedoms the <br/>\n&gt; child is ready for is the observant responsive guardian at first, <br/>\n&gt; then gradually as the kid gets more real experience it shifts to the kid. -=-&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>S-&quot;&gt; My mother in law still tells adults just what to do and how, and <br/>\nchortles <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; derisively at anything except &quot;Okay!  right now! Thanks!.&quot;   A notable <br/>\n&gt; quote--Kirby was five days or so old when she came to see him, and I asked if <br/>\n&gt; she wanted to change his diaper (I thought it was a generous, friendly thing <br/>\n&gt; to offer; she had been a nurse and the mother of three boys).  She came back <br/>\n&gt; and said bruskly with no eye contact &quot;You have to get him circumcised.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (And don&#39;t bother to ask if I lied and said I would.)&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>K- I agree that some people (nosey relatives) are not moved by <br/>\narguments that you are doing the right thing by your best<br/>\navailable knowledge. Sometimes I just say that (whatever) is working <br/>\nwell for us and we&#39;re happy thanks. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;k-&quot; -=-I say the lucky parent who follows the child&#39;s true needs will raise a more <br/>\n&gt; responsible happier person.-=-&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>S-&quot;&gt; She was sure that her children truly needed to do what she said <br/>\nwithout <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hestitation or question until they were out of her house.  Guess how quickly <br/>\n&gt; they were all out of her house?  Navy, run-away, college in another city.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>K- You snipped away the part where I said what I thought a few of a <br/>\nchild&#39;s true needs are. Self control, mutual respect,<br/>\naccomplishment. <br/>\n<br/>\nActually the Navy sounds like another place for someone to be expected <br/>\nto do what they&#39;re told without hesitation or question.<br/>\nIronic. A very challenging career is the military. Many people excel <br/>\nand serve with honors, and learn very useful skills. <br/>\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;k&quot; -=-Anyone who experiences real problems with certain foods is free <br/>\n&gt; to choose to avoid them, and to ask that any caregiver follow that <br/>\n&gt; choice also. If you are not comfortable with that, then the honest thing to <br/>\n&gt; do is to decline to watch the kid.-=-&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>S-&quot;&gt; I&#39;ve had kids come to visit who, AFTER the parent has left says <br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m not allow <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ed to watch TV,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not allowed to play with weapons&quot; or whatever. <br/>\n&gt; Fine!  They can, themselves, avoid such things.  But other than telling my <br/>\n&gt; kids it would be nice if they did something else, I have never said &quot;OKAY <br/>\n&gt; THEN!  TV ban for everyone!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>K- Why not? Is TV sacred? I don&#39;t think TV is evil. Maybe the parent <br/>\nmeant no violent power rangers stuff, or that they wanted<br/>\nthem to play instead of veg. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that you don&#39;t want to deprive anybody, or to make your kids <br/>\ndread his visit. It&#39;s hard to know when to respect another<br/>\nparent&#39;s wishes or not. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nS-&quot;&gt; If parents want to leave their children at my house but they don&#39;t <br/>\nlike my <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; rules (and I&#39;m not talking about peanuts) they shouldn&#39;t leave them there.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>K- Maybe they aren&#39;t aware of that your rules come before theirs, or <br/>\nthat there&#39;s any difference. <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nS-&quot;&gt; If I took money to watch other people&#39;s kids then I&#39;d negotiate.  <br/>\nBut there&#39;s <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; not enough money in the world to get me to lie to kids and say &quot;You can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; have this because it&#39;s bad for you&quot; if I don&#39;t believe it.  There&#39;s not <br/>\n&gt; enough money to get me to control other people&#39;s kids arbitrarily just <br/>\n&gt; because the parents would like to do it but they want to go and do something <br/>\n&gt; else for a while.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>K- Then you would not negotiate. Money has nothing to do with it. They <br/>\ndon&#39;t owe you anything if you agreed to watch the kids<br/>\nfor free. It doesn&#39;t make you better than them. If you don&#39;t like their <br/>\nrestrictions on their kids, maybe you can help nurture the<br/>\nkids in other ways. <br/>\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;k-&quot; I think that as curious <br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers all topics can be up for discussion as they relate to <br/>\n&gt; life, science, health, and personal empowerment through healthy <br/>\n&gt; discussion.-=-&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>S-&quot;&gt; I&#39;m thinking some people might be suffering a bad reaction to the <br/>\ndiscussion. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Who decides if it&#39;s healthy?&quot;&quot; <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>K- I would imagine that if anyone is suffering a bad reaction to this <br/>\ndiscussion they are free to say so. That&#39;s the healthy part. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nS-&quot;&gt; It seemed to me that the tone of the suggestion was more that <br/>\nthose who allow <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; their children freedom (not just of food) are neglectful, but those who are <br/>\n&gt; being controlling are being responsible.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>K- My original post was about parents of children with allergies, not <br/>\nall parents. I think that all parents, with or without allergies,<br/>\nallow as much freedom as they think is safe. I hope like you do that <br/>\nthey will base their judgments on their own children&#39;s&#39; needs<br/>\nand abilities, not on the fears or failings of the adult. <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\nS-&quot;&gt; Maybe there should be an unschooling with allergies list.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI think we are free to make one. I also think it is not necessary to <br/>\npush a topic off to a separate list right away. Many things are<br/>\ndiscussed here, even the weather. I will not keep beating this though. <br/>\nThe question is out there, any replies would be interesting,<br/>\nbut I will not ask it again. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; k &quot;-=-You are free to say that you feel allergies are just an <br/>\n&gt; excuse <br/>\n&gt; for poor parenting and restricting freedom, and I am free to suggest <br/>\n&gt; that they could be real for some, and for everyone to do their own <br/>\n&gt; research.-=-&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>S- &quot;&gt; YES but I didn&#39;t say that.  So you&#39;ve paraphrased me wrongly and <br/>\naddressed <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that.  It&#39;s called attacking a straw man.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>K- I&#39;ve addressed everything else point by point, in exhausting detail <br/>\nto both of your posts. Sorry that I chucked all my feelings<br/>\ntogether into the straw man. <br/>\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; K- &quot;-=-I guess you could live in a remote hut completely free of any social <br/>\n&gt; ties, or restrictions on your freedom. <br/>\n&gt; -=-I would miss you if you lived in a hut.-=-&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>S- &quot;&gt; How can you tell who lives in remote huts and who doesn&#39;t by e-<br/>\nmail?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nK- I can tell by the content that you are not alone in a hut with a <br/>\nsatellite connection. No one who writes to as many posts as you do has <br/>\nany desire to be alone.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nS- &quot;&gt; I&#39;m not free of social ties, and I arrange for my kids to have a <br/>\nlot of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; freedom.  Free to come or go, they stay here and their friends do, too.Free <br/>\n&gt; to go to school or not, they don&#39;t.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>K- I am curious, would you send your kids to school if they begged? How <br/>\nold are they. What have you told them about school<br/>\nthat could influence their decision. I have told my kids when they <br/>\nasked how I felt about my time at school. That may have<br/>\ninfluenced them some, for better or worse. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nS- &quot;Free to eat what they want, they eat an <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; amazingly balanced diet.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>K- Do they shop with you and help plan the meals? I think that is <br/>\nimportant to have freedom of choice. Do you cook or do they?<br/>\nDo you all sit down for one meal a day? We do sometimes. Do you take <br/>\nturns planning the meals, or do you just graze. We graze<br/>\nalot. <br/>\n<br/>\nS- &quot;Free to stay up or sleep, they sleep every single <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; night.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>K- Again I think that could depend on the age.

It&#39;s okay if a child <br/>\nwould rather play alone than watch a movie with the rest of us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be okay if one of my kids wanted to have Thanksgiving with another <br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat has to do with my faith in them, my lack of possessive jealousy about <br/>\nwhere they learn things or how, my confidence in their trust and awareness, <br/>\nand many other factors which have come about because of my beliefs, which are <br/>\nstrengthened and reinforced by my children&#39;s responses to my practices.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo.  When people come to talk about unschooling and they&#39;re having ANY <br/>\nproblems, it&#39;s worth looking at their beliefs and helping them clarify the <br/>\nprinciples on which they want to base their unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they want unschooling to fit in the same space and time that structured <br/>\nhomeschooling was fitting in, it&#39;s not going to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they want unschooling to guarantee that their child is &quot;ahead&quot; in all <br/>\n&quot;subject areas&quot; and gets into college &quot;early,&quot; it&#39;s not going to work.

If Holly&#39;s  having fun <br/>\nwe stay; if not we go.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby and Marty were young we had hours-long unschooling get-togethers <br/>\nat our house or the nearby park weekly, for years (until two years ago).  <br/>\nThere are several families I&#39;ve known lem peacefully and directly.

Parental arbitrary decision designed to make them feel <br/>\nlike good parents.  Deciding in advance what is good for your children, and <br/>\nsticking to it regardless of evidence (or failing to look for evidence once <br/>\nthe &quot;good&quot; decision has been made).<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout putting rules (parental decision) above kids, and putting bad logic <br/>\nabove living with your children in the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I would be helpful for others to <br/>\nkeep an open mind that it could be real. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all real.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome allergies are more real than others.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Many parents have said that their allergic kids feel deprived and <br/>\nbinge, others say their kids understand and feel good about taking<br/>\ncare <br/>\nof themselves.

Try to find a culture with nothing <br/>\nbreadlike or porridge-like (or both).   See what special ingredients might be <br/>\ntoo expensive for daily use and what is saved for celebrations.

They can&#39;t choose fruit over cake if there was no cake available. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nA child can&#39;t clean his room by his own choice (as Marty did a few weeks <br/>\nback--big reorganization) if room cleaning is mandated.  If it is mandated on <br/>\na schedule, the child can ONLY &quot;choose&quot; by choosing not to cooperate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s family of origin set up that kind of &quot;choice&quot;--the &quot;my way or <br/>\nthe highway&quot; scenario.   We have in full knowledge of our intent set out <br/>\nnever to do that to our kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I think that the best person to determine what freedoms the <br/>\nchild is ready for is the observant responsive guardian at first,<br/>\nthen gradually as the kid gets more real experience it shifts to the kid. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother in law still tells adults just what to do and how, and chortles <br/>\nderisively at anything except &quot;Okay!  right now! Thanks!.&quot;   A notable <br/>\nquote--Kirby was five days or so old when she came to see him, and I asked if <br/>\nshe wanted to change his diaper (I thought it was a generous, friendly thing <br/>\nto offer; she had been a nurse and the mother of three boys).  She came back <br/>\nand said bruskly with no eye contact &quot;You have to get him circumcised.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(And don&#39;t bother to ask if I lied and said I would.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I say the lucky parent who follows the child&#39;s true needs will raise a more<br/>\nresponsible happier person.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was sure that her children truly needed to do what she said without <br/>\nhestitation or question until they were out of her house.

Navy, run-away, college in another city.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-You allow you kids the freedom to choose because that&#39;s what works<br/>\nfor you. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMany families do NOT allow children choice because they don&#39;t believe it <br/>\nwould work, they are unwillint to try it, because they don&#39;t WANT it to work. <br/>\n They like control.  (TV, &quot;schoolwork,&quot; bedtime, clothing choices, book <br/>\nchoices, friends, hobbies...)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Anyone who experiences real problems with certain foods is free<br/>\nto choose to avoid them, and to ask that any caregiver follow that<br/>\nchoice also. If you are not comfortable with that, then the honest thing to<br/>\ndo is to decline to watch the kid.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had kids come to visit who, AFTER the parent has left says &quot;I&#39;m not allow<br/>\ned to watch TV,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not allowed to play with weapons&quot; or whatever.  <br/>\nFine!  They can, themselves, avoid such things.  But other than telling my <br/>\nkids it would be nice if they did something else, I have never said &quot;OKAY <br/>\nTHEN!  TV ban for everyone!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf parents want to leave their children at my house but they don&#39;t like my <br/>\nrules (and I&#39;m not talking about peanuts) they shouldn&#39;t leave them there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I took money to watch other people&#39;s kids then I&#39;d negotiate.  But there&#39;s <br/>\nnot enough money in the world to get me to lie to kids and say &quot;You can&#39;t <br/>\nhave this because it&#39;s bad for you&quot; if I don&#39;t believe it.  There&#39;s not <br/>\nenough money to get me to control other people&#39;s kids arbitrarily just <br/>\nbecause the parents would like to do it but they want to go and do something <br/>\nelse for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis culture is filled with people who DO like to boss younger people around. <br/>\n Let them take the money and do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-K- What is your point? That we cannot discuss the possibility of any <br/>\nfood allergies because you feel that average kids don&#39;t have big<br/>\nones? <br/>\nThere are a few homeschooled kids with big allergies. There also are <br/>\nhomeschooled kids with allergies that are not life threatening, but<br/>\nare <br/>\nalso real. There are homeschooled kids that may have hidden allergies <br/>\nthat parents could look into if they choose. There are many<br/>\nhomescholed <br/>\nkids who have no allergies at all.

So you&#39;ve paraphrased me wrongly and addressed <br/>\nthat.  It&#39;s called attacking a straw man.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are real food allergies.  And there are parents who make some up, or <br/>\nhope for a food allergy instead of looking for behavioral changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about changing the way we live.

The complete dismissal of any real problems based on the <br/>\npercieved inconsistancies of a few aquaintances is a bit extreme.

It makes them feel like better parents to say no, and so<br/>\nthey say no <br/>\n&gt; in odd and arbitrary ways, sighing and rolling their eyes.  It<br/>\nhappens not <br/>\n&gt; just with foods.  Sometimes TV.  Sometimes not playing with kids<br/>\nfrom a <br/>\n&gt; certain other town, or neighborhood, or religion.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nK- Do you know any of these people well enough to ask their reasons <br/>\nbehind their choices? Are you upset by their human inconsistancy, the <br/>\nfact that you disagree with their choices, or by their method of <br/>\nexpresing disaproval? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nS-&quot;&gt; We have moms say loudly and with feeling in homeschooling group <br/>\nmeetings <br/>\n&gt; things like &quot;OH, if Bubba has soda he&#39;ll get hyper&quot; or &quot;No more<br/>\nsugar, <br/>\n&gt; Trixie, you&#39;ll never calm down.&quot;  But we KNOW these kids, and sugar<br/>\nand soda <br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t their problem.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nK- Are any of them close friends enough to you for you to see the<br/>\nreal <br/>\nreactions of their kids on or off the foods? Do you only see them on <br/>\nthe days that there is a large gathering of people with lots of<br/>\nexcited <br/>\nkids, and the mom wants to visit and hopes her kids will just play. I <br/>\nagree that that&#39;s not an ideal approach to parenting. Many times I <br/>\nsupervise all the kids while other moms play, because it helps the<br/>\nmoms <br/>\nrelax for once. Saying something &quot;loudly and with feeling&quot; might be <br/>\nasking for help, information or support, but I don&#39;t think ridicule<br/>\nis <br/>\na helpful path.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nS-&quot;Maybe they have to say &quot;MOM&quot; five times with <br/>\n&gt; increasing volume to get their mom&#39;s attention.  Maybe other people<br/>\nhave to <br/>\n&gt; come in TWICE and say &quot;Bubba fell down,&quot; or whatever.  But if the<br/>\nmom can <br/>\n&gt; find something to blame the situation on and say the noise is<br/>\nescalating <br/>\n&gt; because that new other new family brought donuts, instead of<br/>\nthinking maybe <br/>\n&gt; the kids are getting more attention from donuts than their moms,<br/>\nthat&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; easier.  And they calm right down from having found their<br/>\nscapegoat.  Someone <br/>\n&gt; else; a substance.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nK- I agree that there are moms who habitually ignore their kids, and <br/>\nthat the kids get desparate for attention. Even times when otherwise <br/>\nattentive moms are engrossed and ignore their kids. This doesn&#39;t<br/>\nprove <br/>\nor disprove the idea that the donuts could be part of the problem for <br/>\nsome families. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my own anecdotal evidence on the topic of food at meetings <br/>\naffecting the kids&#39; behavior. I was at a La Leche League meeting a<br/>\nfew <br/>\nyears back, and all the kids were playing pretty well until it was <br/>\nsnack time. I saw someone&#39;s sweet tempered 2yo daughter and 4yo son <br/>\nfade into tears, agitation, red cheeks, and fighting a few minutes <br/>\nafter they ate some cookies. That is not scientific, purely<br/>\nempirical. <br/>\nJust an observation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nS-&quot;&gt; I had a friend who was not the most honest of people. She<br/>\nadmitted <br/>\nto it and <br/>\n&gt; said she was trying to get better. She told me that her son wasn&#39;t<br/>\nallergic <br/>\n&gt; to milk at all, but she had told some people he was, just because<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; want them giving him ice cream or cereal. It seemed more dramatic<br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; scientific and fair to say (dishonestly) &quot;lactose intolerant&quot; than<br/>\n&quot;I eat <br/>\n&gt; sugar all the time but I don&#39;t want him to have much.&quot; Then a few<br/>\nmonths <br/>\n&gt; later I was babysitting him and she told me when she left, &quot;He&#39;s<br/>\nallergic to <br/>\n&gt; milk.&quot;    I ignored it; he was fine.  People who are liars need to<br/>\nlearn to <br/>\n&gt; keep their stories straight.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nK- Did you lie to her and say you would follow, or had followed, her <br/>\ninstructions? Why is your idea about his health more important than <br/>\nkeeping your word to her? Your brief observation that he was fine is <br/>\nnot the final word. Reactions can take hours or days to develop.<br/>\nMaybe <br/>\nhe has no sensitivity to it at all, but maybe she was trying an <br/>\nelimination diet. OK too many maybes for this instance, but I say the <br/>\ndecision was not yours to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like people to be as clear as they can without lying.<br/>\nSometimes <br/>\npeople might feel forced to lie and use more recognizable terms like <br/>\n&quot;lactose intolerant&quot; to sound official if they feel that others will <br/>\nnot take their request for &quot;no sugar&quot; seriously. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s<br/>\na <br/>\nuseful approach and can actually damage your cause. I think it&#39;s hard <br/>\nfor parents who want better for their kids than what they do for <br/>\nthemselves. Wanting him to give up sugar but unwilling or able to do<br/>\nit <br/>\nherself. I think that comes back to addiction. Yeah everythings all <br/>\nabout addiction with me. Really though, if she&#39;s adddicted to sugar, <br/>\nbut doesn&#39;t want him to be also. It can be hard to live the life you <br/>\nwant to teach.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nS-&quot;&gt; Twin friends of mine moved to Los Alamos from Espanola when we <br/>\nwere 13.  My <br/>\n&gt; cousin and I had hung out with them weekly or better.  It&#39;s 18<br/>\nmiles, <br/>\n&gt; physically, but a thousand socially.  The mom said they couldn&#39;t<br/>\ncome to our <br/>\n&gt; house anymore, but we could go to theirs.  We lived in the poor<br/>\n&quot;Mexican <br/>\n&gt; town&quot; (only in Los Alamos did anyone use that term in northern New<br/>\nMexico) <br/>\n&gt; and it just wasn&#39;t safe.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Huh.   We went once, for an overnighter, and no more.  We lived in<br/>\nan old <br/>\n&gt; adobe farmhouse, with a big yard to play in, and a parent always<br/>\nhome.  At <br/>\n&gt; their house, they lived in an old two-story quad barracks thing and<br/>\nthe kids <br/>\n&gt; nearly set it on fire while we were there putting a skirt over the<br/>\nlamp to <br/>\n&gt; keep the light low.  They didn&#39;t have any that night,  but they<br/>\ntalked about <br/>\n&gt; having smoked dope (something we had never seen yet in the poor<br/>\ntown down the <br/>\n&gt; hill, but these kids had bought freely from other moneyed anglo<br/>\nkids in their <br/>\n&gt; neighborhood).  So I quit visiting that safe &quot;better&quot; town and the<br/>\ngirls <br/>\n&gt; never ever came to visit us.  But golly their mom felt like a<br/>\nreally great <br/>\n&gt; mom.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nK- I&#39;m not sure how this relates to food allergies. Was that about <br/>\ncontrol? That the mom was controlling of social apperances yet not of <br/>\ndrugs. Or about poor parenting? Or your own regretted misjudgement of <br/>\nthe friends because of their drug use? Or what?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nS-&quot;&gt; Too much of what passes as responsible parenting in some<br/>\nfamilies <br/>\nis <br/>\n&gt; arbitrary superstitious prejudice.  Parents want to feel better<br/>\nabout their <br/>\n&gt; parenting, and they care more about that than they care about<br/>\nreally, truly <br/>\n&gt; looking at the world through their child&#39;s eyes, and about being<br/>\nopen to <br/>\n&gt; really examining their own prejudices and beliefs.   Saying NO is<br/>\nway easier <br/>\n&gt; in some families than saying yes, and often &quot;NO&quot; is wrapped in<br/>\njustifications <br/>\n&gt; and excuses which are so flimsy that even little kids see them as<br/>\nfalsehood.  <br/>\n&gt; And that erodes trust between child and parent, and it erodes the<br/>\nchild&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; faith in the parents&#39; judgement and veracity.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So in a family in which there is a true food allergy, it&#39;s worth<br/>\nthose <br/>\n&gt; parents remembering that they are in the company of others who say<br/>\n&quot;food <br/>\n&gt; allergy&quot; when it&#39;s not really that at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nK- We are reminded of that constantly by the dismissal and doubt. By <br/>\nthe many who question our parenting as being arbitrary and<br/>\ncontrolling <br/>\ninstead of just accepting that we are just trying to work out what <br/>\nreally is a problem for us or not. I would be helpful for others to <br/>\nkeep an open mind that it could be real. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nS-&quot;Or others&#39;  kids are kept from a <br/>\n&gt; food just in case that&#39;s the cause of their hives or excema or<br/>\nsnotty nose or <br/>\n&gt; whatever, and they suffer more stress from the deprivation than<br/>\nthey would <br/>\n&gt; from the actual symptoms.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nK- Many parents have said that their allergic kids feel deprived and <br/>\nbinge, others say their kids understand and feel good about taking<br/>\ncare <br/>\nof themselves. The binging may have more to do with addiction than<br/>\nwith <br/>\nsocial deprivation. I still question why certain foods are so<br/>\nsocially <br/>\nimportant and sacred anyway. Why are the things that are the worst<br/>\nfor <br/>\nus considered treats? Maybe because they might be reserved for<br/>\nspecial <br/>\noccasions like birthdays and thanksgiving, not for everyday. If<br/>\nsugary <br/>\nhigh fat stuff was reserved for feast days instead of breakfast,<br/>\nlunch, <br/>\nand dinner, then there might not be an obesity epidemic in this <br/>\ncountry.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that of course comes back to control. I agree that the best way<br/>\nto <br/>\nteach self control and moderation is by example. I don&#39;t buy junk<br/>\nfoods <br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t want to eat them, not to punish or control my kids.<br/>\nThe <br/>\nfoods that affect us like drugs, I will not buy, frankly for the same <br/>\nreason I don&#39;t buy any other drugs that make us ill. On special <br/>\noccasions my kids seem ok to enjoy cake and ice cream for birthdays, <br/>\npumpkin pie at Thanksgiving. They complain afterwards of tummyaches<br/>\nand <br/>\nrunny nose and cough, but maybe that will help them learn for <br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried to have any foods available all the time, but that<br/>\nwasn&#39;t <br/>\nworking for us right now. Maybe things will change, or maybe like an <br/>\nalcoholic who can never drink again, we&#39;d be better off avoiding <br/>\ncertain foods completely.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nS-&quot;&gt; We share the reputation with other homeschoolers, whether we <br/>\npunish our <br/>\n&gt; children with a rod for looking out the kitchen window instead of<br/>\nstudying <br/>\n&gt; creation science or not.  It&#39;s not fair to deny truths around us.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The suggestion seemed to being made here that those of us who allow<br/>\nour <br/>\n&gt; children freedom to choose whatever foods they want would risk<br/>\ntheir lives <br/>\n&gt; about it.  I don&#39;t think it was rhetorically valid as an argument.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nK- The suggestion that was made is that some children have a life <br/>\nthreatening allergy, and if a parent who is aware of the problem<br/>\nallows <br/>\nthem the freedom to choose whatever they want, that could be a risk<br/>\nto <br/>\ntheir life if they are not old enough to ask every question of every <br/>\nfood, or to have the self control to avoid it. I am all for kids<br/>\nhaving <br/>\nplenty of healthy choices of what and when and how much to eat. <br/>\nLearning to develop your own choices is very important.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s back to control and freedom again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith freedom comes responsibility. There are different opinions about <br/>\nwhen children are old enough for different degrees of freedom and <br/>\nresponsibility. All kids, families, and people are different and<br/>\nthings <br/>\nchange. I think that the best person to determine what freedoms the <br/>\nchild is ready for is the observant responsive guardian at first,<br/>\nthen <br/>\ngradually as the kid gets more real experience it shifts to the kid. <br/>\nThat might bristle those who want to kids to have absolute freedom. I <br/>\nsay that as parents we make choices for the newborn and gradually do <br/>\nless as they do more. Conventional parenting seems to say that the <br/>\nparent dictates every choice and the child must obey. I say the lucky <br/>\nparent who follows the child&#39;s true needs will raise a more<br/>\nresponsible <br/>\nhappier person. I mean needs like mutual respect, self regulation, <br/>\naccomplishment, and responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou allow you kids the freedom to choose because that&#39;s what works<br/>\nfor <br/>\nyou. Anyone who experiences real problems with certain foods is free<br/>\nto <br/>\nchoose to avoid them, and to ask that any caregiver follow that<br/>\nchoice <br/>\nalso. If you are not comfortable with that, then the honest thing to<br/>\ndo <br/>\nis to decline to watch the kid.<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n <br/>\nS-&quot;&gt; Unschooling might be a HORRIBLE choice for some families,<br/>\ntotally <br/>\nunworkable, <br/>\n&gt; some kids (for whatever mental or social reasons) might NEVER hang<br/>\nout at <br/>\n&gt; home reading and playing and learning.  And in those families,<br/>\nunschooling <br/>\n&gt; would not work.  But this is an unschooling list.  And so it&#39;s<br/>\ntotally <br/>\n&gt; reasonable for us to assume that readers are unschoolers or would<br/>\nlike to be. <br/>\n&gt;  And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable to assume along with that that<br/>\nif we <br/>\n&gt; talk about foods we&#39;re talking about average homeschooled kids<br/>\nwithout big <br/>\n&gt; allergies.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nK- What is your point? That we cannot discuss the possibility of any <br/>\nfood allergies because you feel that average kids don&#39;t have big<br/>\nones? <br/>\nThere are a few homeschooled kids with big allergies. There also are <br/>\nhomeschooled kids with allergies that are not life threatening, but<br/>\nare <br/>\nalso real. There are homeschooled kids that may have hidden allergies <br/>\nthat parents could look into if they choose. There are many<br/>\nhomescholed <br/>\nkids who have no allergies at all. I think that as curious <br/>\nhomeschoolers all topics can be up for discussion as they relate to <br/>\nlife, science, health, and personal empowerment through healthy <br/>\ndiscussion.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nS-&quot;&gt; I don&#39;t think an entire school should be stripped of peanuts for <br/>\ntwo kids.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nK- They are not your two kids. Peanuts are not sacred. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nS-&quot;&gt; I don&#39;t think this list should be stripped of discussions about <br/>\nallowing kids <br/>\n&gt; freedom, because a kid&#39;s mom might be exposed to something that<br/>\nwould be <br/>\n&gt; dangerous to her child if she tried it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nK- Whenever was that a real concern? Nowhere was it even suggested.<br/>\nIt <br/>\nseems though that you are suggesting stripping the list of discussion <br/>\nof food allergies because the average homeschooler doesn&#39;t have big <br/>\nones.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you mean that you feel that some posts have suggested <br/>\ndiscussions of freedom of kids are not safe for the list, because <br/>\npeople with kids who have life threatening allergies might be tempted <br/>\nby a discussion of allowing kids freedom, to let their kids eat <br/>\nanything. I haven&#39;t seen that, nor do I think it&#39;s a real danger.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not want to restrict discussion. I would like it to be open and <br/>\nhonest. You are free to say that you feel allergies are just an<br/>\nexcuse <br/>\nfor poor parenting and restricting freedom, and I am free to suggest <br/>\nthat they could be real for some, and for everyone to do their own <br/>\nresearch.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all know that people dealing with life threatening allergies are<br/>\nnot <br/>\nfools. They research and deal with it the best they can. They put up <br/>\nwith derision, dismissal, and criticism from those who have no clue. <br/>\nThey will not be harmed by real discussions of freedom. They actually <br/>\nhave a good deal more at stake than some when the issues of their <br/>\nfreedoms are concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand you don&#39;t want your absolute freedom to be remotely <br/>\ninterferred with by anyone elses&#39; needs, but that&#39;s not life in a <br/>\nsociety. We are together because we look out for each other,<br/>\notherwise <br/>\nI guess you could live in a remote hut completely free of any social <br/>\nties, or restrictions on your freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would miss you if you lived in a hut.<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n <br/>\nS-&quot;&gt; Nobody&#39;s going to scrape peanut butter, or an idea, off their <br/>\nkeyboard and <br/>\n&gt; die.  (Or if they do, the peanut butter will not have arrived by<br/>\ne-mail.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nK- Now that&#39;s just thoughtless.

It makes them feel like better parents to say no, and so they say no <br/>\nin odd and arbitrary ways, sighing and rolling their eyes.  It happens not <br/>\njust with foods.  Sometimes TV.  Sometimes not playing with kids from a <br/>\ncertain other town, or neighborhood, or religion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have moms say loudly and with feeling in homeschooling group meetings <br/>\nthings like &quot;OH, if Bubba has soda he&#39;ll get hyper&quot; or &quot;No more sugar, <br/>\nTrixie, you&#39;ll never calm down.&quot;  But we KNOW these kids, and sugar and soda <br/>\naren&#39;t their problem.  Maybe they have to say &quot;MOM&quot; five times with <br/>\nincreasing volume to get their mom&#39;s attention.  Maybe other people have to <br/>\ncome in TWICE and say &quot;Bubba fell down,&quot; or whatever.  But if the mom can <br/>\nfind something to blame the situation on and say the noise is escalating <br/>\nbecause that new other new family brought donuts, instead of thinking maybe <br/>\nthe kids are getting more attention from donuts than their moms, that&#39;s <br/>\neasier.  And they calm right down from having found their scapegoat.  Someone <br/>\nelse; a substance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a friend who was not the most honest of people. She admitted to it and <br/>\nsaid she was trying to get better. She told me that her son wasn&#39;t allergic <br/>\nto milk at all, but she had told some people he was, just because she didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant them giving him ice cream or cereal. It seemed more dramatic and <br/>\nscientific and fair to say (dishonestly) &quot;lactose intolerant&quot; than &quot;I eat <br/>\nsugar all the time but I don&#39;t want him to have much.&quot; Then a few months <br/>\nlater I was babysitting him and she told me when she left, &quot;He&#39;s allergic to <br/>\nmilk.&quot;    I ignored it; he was fine.
