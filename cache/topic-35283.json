They have a good discussion of<br/>\nthe law on the website and good people to answer questions on the email<br/>\nlist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mhla.org\">http://www.mhla.org</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:masshomelearningassoc-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">masshomelearningassoc-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MAhomeschoolers-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">MAhomeschoolers-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(One is more for legal discussion and one for more general homeschooling<br/>\ndiscussion and I forget which is which. But you can ask any question on<br/>\neither -- or go to the website and read the descriptions of the lists!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI use Carol Narigon&#39;s letter, which Sandra Dodd helpfully makes available at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html\">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAs for HSLDA, the general feeling outside fundamentalist Christian<br/>\nschool-at-home circles is that they are more harmful than helpful. You can<br/>\nread more about them at More Inforation on HSLDA<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/page/folchslda)\">http://expage.com/page/folchslda)</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *think* there was a lawyer or two listed at the MHLA website, but if not,<br/>\nthe MHLA list might be a good place to ask. But you shouldn&#39;t need one. If<br/>\nyou send in your letter of intent and a plan that they can&#39;t prove to be<br/>\nineffective and you can come to some agreement on assessment (it says the<br/>\nform of assessment must be approved by the parents) then there&#39;s no reason<br/>\nto have problems. If a superintendent is asking for more than allowed, it<br/>\nhelps to quote relevant passages from the case laws in your reply to them.<br/>\n(Generally they are speaking from their assumption of how laws should work<br/>\nor are counting on your ignorance.) There&#39;s also a &quot;For Superintendent&#39;s&quot;<br/>\npage at HMLA&#39;s website that you can send to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Intro and a question about reporting and the law--","postDate":"1019232818","msgId":35309,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Ni5kMjgwZWQ1LjI5ZjE5YzMyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35292,"nextInTopic":35313,"prevInTime":35308,"nextInTime":35310,"topicId":35283,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/19/02 8:51:13 AM, pagan_dar@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1110884180\">In a message dated 4/19/02 8:51:13 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pagan_dar@...\">pagan_dar@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Has anyone needed help from a lawyer?
