I don&#39;t think I want to go THERE.  That&#39;s another assumption, too, when <br/>\npeople hear I&#39;m homeschooling, they often think it&#39;s because I&#39;m Christian.  <br/>\n*wrong*<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that reminds me of your post on Children&#39;s Rights.  A lot of the most <br/>\nliberal people I&#39;ve talked to, when they had an issue with homeschooling, point <br/>\nto those kinds of situations as the dark side of a home based education.  If we <br/>\nhad a standard Children&#39;s Rights bill, or constitutional amendment, that <br/>\nissue wouldn&#39;t be such a problem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHey, maybe all the unschooled kids will get the momentum going one day and <br/>\nget the international treaty ratified here in the states.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo clarify what I&#39;m talking about.....On the human right&#39;s watch page<br/>\n&lt;&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hrw.org/children/\">http://www.hrw.org/children/</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Despite the convention&#39;s near-universal ratification (only the U.S. and <br/>\nSomalia have not ratified it), children are still denied their basic rights. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Aimee</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75451,"nextTopicId":75469}}
