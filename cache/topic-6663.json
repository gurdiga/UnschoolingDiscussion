My name is Lara Kimber, and I wanted to take a moment <br/>\nto introduce myself. First, thank you very much for allowing me to be <br/>\na part of your discussions. I enjoy very much talking with other <br/>\nhomeschoolers, and know that in my entire lifetime I will never cease <br/>\nto learn new things. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am currently a stay at home mom, married to a supportive and hard <br/>\nworking husband named Sam, and we have a wonderful 16th month old <br/>\ndaughter named Abigail. We are also currently living in the Marietta, <br/>\nGA. area.  Though Abigail may not be &quot;officially&quot; homeschooling yet, <br/>\nI do believe that we learn from birth and homeschooling is just a <br/>\nnatural progression from there. I knew about 5 years before I had <br/>\nAbigail that I would be homeschooling my children. It was actually <br/>\nsomething I had thought of since my childhood and as I grew older I <br/>\nknew for a fact that it was what I wanted to do for my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been reading more and more about Unschooling. I currently <br/>\nsubscribe to Growing Without Schooling magazine, and I have become a <br/>\nbig fan of John Holt&#39;s books. I&#39;ve also started collecting other <br/>\nbooks on Unschooling. While I cannot say that we will Unschool <br/>\ncompletely (as of yet *wink*), I do know that it will be a large part <br/>\nof our lifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost a year ago I founded a Homeschool Support Group <br/>\ncalled &quot;L.L.G. - Lifetime Learners of Georgia&quot;. Due to my computer <br/>\ndying, I have been without the Internet for almost 7 months, but <br/>\nother members of the group helped keep it running while I was away. I <br/>\nam happy to say that my family now has another computer and I am <br/>\nworking hard to pick back up where I left off with the support group. <br/>\nI am also resubscribing to any discussion lists that I became dropped <br/>\nfrom due to inactivity. So I am sure I will see some familiar names. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe L.L.G. website can be found at: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freeyellow.com/members8/llg/\">http://www.freeyellow.com/members8/llg/</a> , and I will be updating it <br/>\nthis week (as it is very outdated due to my lack of computer). It <br/>\nwill also be continually updated and if you know anyone in need of a <br/>\nsupport group in Georgia, feel free to give out our web address, so <br/>\nthey can see if we might be able to help. Anyone can of course drop <br/>\nby if they like. I am hoping the site will be of help to all <br/>\nhomeschoolers, not just the members of L.L.G. We also have an email <br/>\ndiscussion list which can be found at: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/LLGlist\">http://www.egroups.com/group/LLGlist</a> . Thanks to the storage <br/>\nabilities of the Internet, our website and email list (including <br/>\narchived posts) are still there. For that I am very greatful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe L.L.G. support group caters to the diverse society we live in, <br/>\nand all homeschooling families are welcome! However, our members <br/>\nprefer their religious and political beliefs not be a part of the <br/>\ngroup&#39;s identity and purpose. We are in no way related with the <br/>\nSecular Humanists, nor are we anti-Christian, or any other religious <br/>\nor political belief, in any way. Our group is an eclectic mix of many <br/>\npersonal religious and political beliefs. Our main focus is to <br/>\nsupport learning lifestyles. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am eager to begin speaking and interacting with other homeschoolers <br/>\nagain. I look forward to learning from you all, and helping any way I <br/>\npossibly can. My current email address is: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrslarak@...\">mrslarak@...</a>. Please <br/>\nfeel free to contact me through email if you ever want information <br/>\nabout the L.L.G. support group, or just to talk.  *smile* <br/>\n<br/>\nLara Kimber<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The important thing is not to stop questioning&quot;<br/>\n-- Albert Einstein (1879-1955)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"K WORTHEN","from":"&quot;K WORTHEN&quot; &lt;kworthen@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"nYExXeThvvwzy4NIimEqj9_PzQHLoI36sYpmdW7kLWY9UWqaFFBOTZQOeAS7GDnWv11702NJ_gaG33LzY2VtOBYsCH4AWCRv9e8","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: Welcome to Unschooling-dotcom","postDate":"951345512","msgId":6746,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MzEuNjc0Ni45NTkyNjk3NDdAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6702,"nextInTopic":8704,"prevInTime":6745,"nextInTime":6747,"topicId":6663,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t think so, but I ll ask my father in law.
