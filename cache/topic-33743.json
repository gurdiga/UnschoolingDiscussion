I had a memory when you were talking about your Dad. I remember being able to figure out math problems, I think addition, without taking the steps REQUIRED. I remember my teacher telling me that the problem was wrong though the answer was right because I did not follow the STEPS! That may be why I dont like math to this day, because I dont want to do it &quot;wrong&quot;. How awful, I have always carried this fear that I am doing it wrong. That may be why! Ok- dont laugh everyone- major epiphany going on here! :-)<br/>\nGod bless<br/>\nVivian<br/>\nMom to three Happy little Monkeys<br/>\nAustin 10/31/93 Sarah 8/28/95 Emmalee 8/15/00<br/>\nAnd loving wife to Randy<br/>\n<br/>\n**If fifty million people say a foolish thing, it is still a foolish thing.<br/>\n-Anatole France***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: zenmomma * <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, March 26, 2002 7:20 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Answering people<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;My brother almost didn&#39;t graduate high school, from all his f&#39;s in<br/>\n  English.  He skipped English to go to the computer lab and play with<br/>\n  computers.  Fortunately my sister tutored him that last six months of<br/>\n  prison, I mean high school, so he was set free, I mean graduated.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  This was my Dad! Well, except that they didn&#39;t have computer lab in 1939. <br/>\n  ;-) But he also had loads of trouble in school due to poor English grades. <br/>\n  And they&#39;d also mark his math papers wrong, or worse failed for cheating, <br/>\n  becasue he didn&#39;t show his steps when he solved problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This man definitely dreams in numbers. I wouldn&#39;t recognize his house if he <br/>\n  didn&#39;t have long strings of numbers listed on papers on various desk tops <br/>\n  and counters throughout the house. He hated his one year in Cooper Union <br/>\n  College and went on to become an Electrical Engineer on his own. He told me <br/>\n  that the schools step by step process didn&#39;t make sense to him. He had to <br/>\n  make sense of the numbers on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, the best part of the story follows. This man who failed every English <br/>\n  class, who hated to read, who swore he couldn&#39;t write or spell, has written <br/>\n  a book. When he retired he became one of those guys who does geneology. He <br/>\n  does nothing but read, write, research and use his beloved numbers <br/>\n  practically every day. He wrote a book on his findings and they put it in <br/>\n  his local library for other researchers to use. He is just my best example <br/>\n  of *they&#39;ll learn it because they need it and have an interest*.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Life is good.<br/>\n  ~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n  _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
