Just the whole TRUSTING our <br/>\n&gt; children is sooo empowering to them and to us. I keep saying to my two year <br/>\n&gt; old all the time now when she is trying to destroy her sister, &quot;come here, <br/>\n&gt; I like it when you are near me.&quot; and she feels so great about it, I want to <br/>\n&gt; be with her, and she wants to be with me too!
