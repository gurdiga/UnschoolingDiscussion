One is REALLY old (maybe 30 or so), is a combination<br/>\nconvection oven and dehydrator (I like it the best) and I don&#39;t have the<br/>\nfaintest what the name is (it is in the rafters now as we are done<br/>\ndehydrating for this year) and the other one is one of those round things<br/>\nthey sell in tv which we bought because it was cheap and we needed to run<br/>\nmore trays during the peak season.  It works pretty well and you can buy<br/>\nspecial sheets to set in them for making fruit leathers.  The other reason<br/>\nwe bought it was the kidlets wanted to do their own dehydrating and it isn&#39;t<br/>\nheavy and it doesn&#39;t get hot to the touch where little hands would get<br/>\nburned.  It is easy to use and they love using it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Valerie Herrera &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vcveggie@...\">vcveggie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, November 30, 2001 11:18 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Lynda&#39;s waffle recipe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Thank you!
