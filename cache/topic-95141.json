At least right now, though, <br/>\nI&#39;m an expert at frugal living.  I know frugal is not always simple <br/>\nliving because simple can mean living with less (which may or may not <br/>\nbe simple--gardening is definately not simple), or it can just mean a <br/>\nsimpler, more organized life (which can mean living with more <br/>\nexpensive products to keep your life simple--think, Simple Living <br/>\nMagazine).  Gardening and cooking from scratch is not simple, but it <br/>\ndoes use less resources.  This is opposed to having your grocery <br/>\nstore deliver and ordering out, which uses more resources but less of <br/>\nyour own time and energy.  I&#39;m assuming your definition of simple <br/>\nliving is the same one as mine and that you&#39;re looking to live with <br/>\nless while using less resources.
