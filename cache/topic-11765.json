Even if I&#39;m beginning to read something that I don&#39;t <br/>\nlike about a particular post I read the rest of it.  I&#39;ve learned that there <br/>\nis a lot of valuable information in a post that I can learn about another&#39;s <br/>\nlifestyle or what they are doing with kids.  Your last one for example was <br/>\nvery interesting in how you do the unschooling with your hubbie.. My husband <br/>\nis at work outside the home all day and gets home at 4:14pm and take over <br/>\nwith the kids then and all weekend so I can run my business.  It&#39;s wonderful <br/>\nto see how he&#39;s different with them and what he brings to the relationship.  <br/>\nHowever ultimately I&#39;m making the decisions because I&#39;m the one that&#39;s home.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s not to say that if he wants to do something with them he asks me... <br/>\nOnly asks me if I want to come with him, which most of the time, to be honest <br/>\nwhen I&#39;ve been with them from 6am every morning, if he wants to do something <br/>\nwith the kids in this 109 degree weather I&#39;m just as happy for him to go and <br/>\ngive me a few hours peace and quiet so I can get my head together and nourish <br/>\nmy own soul and spirit for the onslaught of questions coming the next day <br/>\n(LOL)....<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I are working on changing positions... We are consolidating <br/>\nour outstanding debt so that he can stay home with the kids and I&#39;ll expand <br/>\nmy business to support all of us... The goal is for both of us to work part <br/>\ntime in our respective businesses so that we can both be at home with the <br/>\nkids and give them the benefit of both of us.  This is a life choice we are <br/>\nmaking happen, one day at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11733,"nextTopicId":11766}}
