I homeschool my 12 yr <br/>\nold son part time, and send him to a charter school for science.  I <br/>\nalso teach a Literature and Writing Circle for middleschoolers at the <br/>\nschool, of which my son is a student.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hold a B.A. degree in Multiple Subjects, but do not have a <br/>\ncredential, deciding at graduation that I DID NOT want to be a part <br/>\nof the state educational system.  I have taught private school, and <br/>\nalso had my own tutoring business over the years.  Since my son was <br/>\nborn, I have been at home full time, earning extra money doing <br/>\ndesktop publishing for clubs and organizations, teaching basic <br/>\ncomputer skills, and tutoring K-12 students in all subjects.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main job has been raising and educating my son.  I finally pulled <br/>\nhim out of regular public school last year, after finally convincing <br/>\nmy husband that it was in our son&#39;s best interest to educate using <br/>\nalternative schooling methods such as the charter school.  Thank God <br/>\nthe school is so supportive of homeschooling and unschooling.  They <br/>\nhave been very helpful and encouraging about the choices I have made <br/>\nfor my son.  Basically they offer a variety of classes at the school, <br/>\nwith an emphasis on Scienct and Math.  Many classes are taught by <br/>\nparent volunteers like me.  I like the variety of choice available to <br/>\nmy son.  He was able to choose for himself which classes he wished to <br/>\ntake in the charter school setting, and which areas he wished to <br/>\nlearn at home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt first, it was difficult to let go of my need to impress on him <br/>\na &quot;schedule&quot; for his days at home.  I had to let go of the idea that <br/>\nI was supposed to be &quot;teacher&quot; during &quot;school-time&quot; and &quot;Mom&quot; the <br/>\nrest of the time.  Another homeschool/charter school parent helped me <br/>\nrealize that as my son&#39;s &quot;Mom&quot; I am ALWAYS teaching him.  Now, after <br/>\nseveral months, I  am much more relaxed, and allow him to choose for <br/>\nhimself what he wishes to learn and when.  I discovered that if I <br/>\njust provide a variety of learning opportunities, and then get out of <br/>\nthe way, learning will take place naturally, and will be a joy for <br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are a bi-racial family.  I am French/Cherokee and my dh is black.  <br/>\nAs far as how our being a bi-racial family fits into homeschooling, I <br/>\nincorporate much more cultural awareness and history than he would <br/>\nget at a public school.  We live in a rural area of northern <br/>\nCalifornia, and, unfortunately, there is a lot of racism in our <br/>\narea.  There is very little cultural awareness or history, especially <br/>\nBlack History, taught in the public schools here.  A nod is given on <br/>\nMartin Luther King Day; perhaps with one day of general history that <br/>\nincludes Dr. King&#39;s story and a sanctimonius message <br/>\nabout &quot;brotherhood&quot; and &quot;equality&quot;.  Unfortunately, the life lessons <br/>\nmy son has learned at the public schools, and, indeed, in our local <br/>\nneighborhood about &quot;brotherhood&quot; and &quot;equality&quot; are not encouraging.  <br/>\nHe has had to learn that there are those who wish him ill merely for <br/>\nthe color of his skin.  But I also teach that there are many others <br/>\nwho respect and care about him for his character and talents, <br/>\nirregardless of his ethnic background.  We attend marches and <br/>\nfestivals to celebrate his African heritage, as well as pow-wows and <br/>\nclasses at the local Indian Educatin Center.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAt home, he doesn&#39;t have to worry about gangs and gang violence, or <br/>\nabout kids from racist homes harassing him or beating him up.  At his <br/>\ncharter school, there are only about 30 kids in the middle school <br/>\ngrades.  All come from good families where the parents are <br/>\nenlightened and very involved with their kids education.  As when he <br/>\nwas in public school, he is the only black kid in his class.  But the <br/>\natmosphere of inclusion at his new school is so different from the <br/>\natmosphere of exclusion he knew before!<br/>\n<br/>\nI know homeschooling my son is the right choice for our family.  I <br/>\nwish to learn more about unschooling.  This is a new concept for me.  <br/>\nBut I like what I&#39;m learning about it.  Perhaps next year, I&#39;ll be <br/>\nready to make the leap to unschooling...<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo! Groups SponsorADVERTISEMENT<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

(My 18-year-old has been unschooling for 10 years.)  I <br/>\ntaught  in elementary schools for 4 years after I graduated from <br/>\ncollege in 1965.  In the spring of my second year of teaching, I read <br/>\nSummerhill, and was forever changed.  It brought to the forefront <br/>\nthings that, at some level, I already knew. But I was very shy, and it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t until I had children that I became brave enough to live these <br/>\nideas.  My daughter was born in 1969, and I became an at-home mom--very <br/>\nclear in knowing that, even if it meant being poor, it was the only <br/>\nthing that made sense to me.  When she was 2, she attended Community <br/>\nPlay Group (a cooperative), where children were free to choose how they <br/>\nspent their time.  When she was 3, I was given this preschool and <br/>\nstayed involved for 8 more years.  In 1979, a second daughter was born, <br/>\nand it wasn&#39;t long before I came across books by John Holt, which <br/>\nreinforced what I had been lucky enough to observe in my own children <br/>\nand the children in the cooperative preschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 3 awesome children (ages 33, 23, and 18), and when people ask me <br/>\nwhat I did as a parent that made them so awesome, I tell them that it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t what I did, but rather it was what I didn&#39;t do.  I spent (still <br/>\ndo) lots of time getting to know who they are instead of trying to make <br/>\nthem be who they aren&#39;t.  Choice (which, I like to say, began in the <br/>\nwomb) was always (well, o.k., almost always) a part of their lives, and <br/>\nthey learned from the choices they made.  What I wanted for my children <br/>\nwas for them to know themselves, be happy, know how to solve problems, <br/>\nand pursue their passions.  Each child has taught me something major <br/>\nabout life, which has been my biggest surprise about mothering.  My <br/>\nparents never said, &quot;We learned so much from you children.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n From the time I was in elementary school, I knew I wanted to be a <br/>\nteacher.  I haven&#39;t called myself teacher for a long time, because that <br/>\nimplies imparting knowledge.  Instead, I think of myself as sharing in <br/>\nthe life journey of people of all ages.  Not a title,  just a person.  <br/>\nAt present, I�m known as tutor to 20 in-school children who live in <br/>\npublic housing, consultant to 28 homeschooling (some unschoolers, some <br/>\nnot) families, Mom to my unschooler son and grown children, and Nana to <br/>\nalmost-3-year-old Ylena.  Hmmm.  Are those titles?<br/>\n<br/>\nDid having a teaching background help or hinder my unschooling  <br/>\nleanings?  Who can say?  Teaching school, being a parent, having a <br/>\npreschool, tutoring, living life--all of these experiences have <br/>\ncontributed to this passion of mine, this belief that the best learning <br/>\nhappens where there is freedom to pursue one�s interests and passions.  <br/>\nHave I wrestled with my background in traditional schooling and teacher <br/>\neducation?  You bet!  When we first dumped the curriculum and Zach  <br/>\nspent hours playing with Legos, I had weekly panic moments about what <br/>\nwe weren&#39;t doing.  Over time, we learned to laugh at these, and they <br/>\ngradually ceased.  I think there&#39;s a developmental process that takes <br/>\nplace as people who have been traditionally schooled  move toward <br/>\nembracing unschooling.

We follow a spiritual Hindu tradition too, <br/>\nso she learns from that as well. Anyway, it&#39;s like an ecclectic mixture <br/>\nof things I guess.

I just wanted to warn you that the word &quot;teach&quot;<br/>\nsometimes raises flak in this forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main point is that a lot of us believe that learning is something<br/>\nthat a person does to themselves, with or without the help of a teacher<br/>\nor a book.  The learning happens in the mind of the learner.  When I see<br/>\n&quot;teaching&quot; as a transitive verb, with the student as the object, I feel<br/>\nuncomfortable.  (I don&#39;t think young people should be treated like<br/>\nobjects, and that sometimes happens in the assembly-line public school<br/>\nsystem, as you know.)  I like the Yeats (?) quote that says teaching or<br/>\nlearning isn&#39;t like filling a bucket, it&#39;s like lighting a fire.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it&#39;s tempting to rephrase what you said above to break it into two ideas:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) As a human being, your son is always learning from the world around him.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) As his mom, one of the most important people in his life **, your son<br/>\ninteracts very frequently with you and learns a great deal from those interactions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I&#39;m fiddling around here *just* to make the word &quot;teach&quot; go away.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m uncomfortable with saying that we teach our children, but I&#39;m fine<br/>\nwith saying that we inspire them.

I homeschool my 12 yr <br/>\nold son part time, and send him to a charter school for science.  I <br/>\nalso teach a Literature and Writing Circle for middleschoolers at the <br/>\nschool, of which my son is a student.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hold a B.A. degree in Multiple Subjects, but do not have a <br/>\ncredential, deciding at graduation that I DID NOT want to be a part <br/>\nof the state educational system.  I have taught private school, and <br/>\nalso had my own tutoring business over the years.  Since my son was <br/>\nborn, I have been at home full time, earning extra money doing <br/>\ndesktop publishing for clubs and organizations, teaching basic <br/>\ncomputer skills, and tutoring K-12 students in all subjects.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main job has been raising and educating my son.  I finally pulled <br/>\nhim out of regular public school last year, after finally convincing <br/>\nmy husband that it was in our son&#39;s best interest to educate using <br/>\nalternative schooling methods such as the charter school.  Thank God <br/>\nthe school is so supportive of homeschooling and unschooling.  They <br/>\nhave been very helpful and encouraging about the choices I have made <br/>\nfor my son.  Basically they offer a variety of classes at the school, <br/>\nwith an emphasis on Scienct and Math.  Many classes are taught by <br/>\nparent volunteers like me.  I like the variety of choice available to <br/>\nmy son.  He was able to choose for himself which classes he wished to <br/>\ntake in the charter school setting, and which areas he wished to <br/>\nlearn at home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt first, it was difficult to let go of my need to impress on him <br/>\na &quot;schedule&quot; for his days at home.  I had to let go of the idea that <br/>\nI was supposed to be &quot;teacher&quot; during &quot;school-time&quot; and &quot;Mom&quot; the <br/>\nrest of the time.  Another homeschool/charter school parent helped me <br/>\nrealize that as my son&#39;s &quot;Mom&quot; I am ALWAYS teaching him.  Now, after <br/>\nseveral months, I  am much more relaxed, and allow him to choose for <br/>\nhimself what he wishes to learn and when.  I discovered that if I <br/>\njust provide a variety of learning opportunities, and then get out of <br/>\nthe way, learning will take place naturally, and will be a joy for <br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are a bi-racial family.  I am French/Cherokee and my dh is black.  <br/>\nAs far as how our being a bi-racial family fits into homeschooling, I <br/>\nincorporate much more cultural awareness and history than he would <br/>\nget at a public school.  We live in a rural area of northern <br/>\nCalifornia, and, unfortunately, there is a lot of racism in our <br/>\narea.  There is very little cultural awareness or history, especially <br/>\nBlack History, taught in the public schools here.  A nod is given on <br/>\nMartin Luther King Day; perhaps with one day of general history that <br/>\nincludes Dr. King&#39;s story and a sanctimonius message <br/>\nabout &quot;brotherhood&quot; and &quot;equality&quot;.  Unfortunately, the life lessons <br/>\nmy son has learned at the public schools, and, indeed, in our local <br/>\nneighborhood about &quot;brotherhood&quot; and &quot;equality&quot; are not encouraging.  <br/>\nHe has had to learn that there are those who wish him ill merely for <br/>\nthe color of his skin.  But I also teach that there are many others <br/>\nwho respect and care about him for his character and talents, <br/>\nirregardless of his ethnic background.  We attend marches and <br/>\nfestivals to celebrate his African heritage, as well as pow-wows and <br/>\nclasses at the local Indian Educatin Center.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAt home, he doesn&#39;t have to worry about gangs and gang violence, or <br/>\nabout kids from racist homes harassing him or beating him up.  At his <br/>\ncharter school, there are only about 30 kids in the middle school <br/>\ngrades.  All come from good families where the parents are <br/>\nenlightened and very involved with their kids education.  As when he <br/>\nwas in public school, he is the only black kid in his class.  But the <br/>\natmosphere of inclusion at his new school is so different from the <br/>\natmosphere of exclusion he knew before!<br/>\n<br/>\nI know homeschooling my son is the right choice for our family.  I <br/>\nwish to learn more about unschooling.  This is a new concept for me.  <br/>\nBut I like what I&#39;m learning about it.  Perhaps next year, I&#39;ll be <br/>\nready to make the leap to unschooling...<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96351299,"authorName":"Q","from":"&quot;Q&quot; &lt;witchmama@...&gt;","profile":"quenbya","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Happy New Year, a real self-intro, and some questions","postDate":"1041491454","msgId":52919,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwN2YwMWMyYjIyZSQxNzY4ZDA2MCQwMjAwYThjMEBBT0tJPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":52947,"prevInTime":52918,"nextInTime":52920,"topicId":52919,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been on the list for a month and have responded to a few things, but I don t think I ever wrote a proper self-intro.
