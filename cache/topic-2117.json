I know most of the<br/>\n&#39;school moms&#39; around here are eagerly anticipating the start of school so<br/>\nthey can separate the siblings!<br/>\nMy three do have their moments/days;  but overall,  they seem to do fine<br/>\nwith each other.  I have wondered if schooling fosters sibling rivalry --<br/>\nwith the separation into age groups and the peer pressure to be &#39;cool&#39;.  I<br/>\nwonder if the parent&#39;s frustration comes in part from the pressure about<br/>\nbeginning the school year and hoping your child will &#39;measure up&#39; , make<br/>\nfriends,  etc.  And if the children fight more knowing their time will be so<br/>\nscheduled, the homework battles will begin, etc.<br/>\nI&#39;m afraid I haven&#39;t come close to answering your questions.... :-(<br/>\nHave you seen the books  Siblings Without Rivalry   and  How to Talk So Your<br/>\nChild Will Listen And Listen So Your Child Will Talk  ?<br/>\nIt&#39;s a tough balance between letting them work it out on their own and<br/>\nintervening to mediate.<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RRAINENJ@...\">RRAINENJ@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It seems everytime I turn around, my children are fighting!!!
