They are wonderful people and very<br/>\nsupportive of most of what we do, even when they may not get it.  (They are<br/>\nChristian, we are pagan, they are more traditional, we are, well, not!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, they asked if 7 year old DS was going to school this year or if we<br/>\nwere keeping him home again.  (Last year was first year home--after pulling<br/>\nhim 3 weeks in.)  I said we were keeping him home and planning, with his<br/>\nagreement, to do so all the way through.  MIL asked DS what he thought of<br/>\nthat and he just grinned and gave a thumbs up.  (Love this kid!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then she asked, &quot;Well how do you know he&#39;s learning what the other kids<br/>\nare?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI swear to you this answer was out of my mouth before I realized how bitchy<br/>\nI might sound, but I just said, &quot;Who cares?&quot;  She gave me such a shocked<br/>\nlook!  I added, &quot;I care what HE&#39;s learning, what HE needs to know, not what<br/>\nthey are doing in school.&quot;  Then she sort of laughed, nervously, and said,<br/>\n&quot;Well, I mean can he READ?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point I got a little annoyed, but said, &quot;Of course he can.  He reads<br/>\nvery well.&quot;  And went on to explain how I knew he read well because he reads<br/>\nhis gaming books and reads things off the TV and games and....THEN she<br/>\nquized him, &quot;Well read something for me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI defended him and said, quite honestly, &quot;He doesn&#39;t PERFORM.&quot;  And he never<br/>\nhas, it&#39;s part of why &quot;school at home&quot; doesn&#39;t work for us.  He can do it or<br/>\nhe can&#39;t, put he won&#39;t put on a show of it either way.  I told him outright<br/>\nhe didn&#39;t have to do it.  About a half hour later he picked up the sample my<br/>\nFIL had given him and read it out, clear as a bell.  MIL teased that he&#39;d<br/>\nmemorized it.  Uhm, something off the back of a phone book???  Why would he<br/>\nread it at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think they have a clue they were being rude about it.  -sigh-<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, they have a pair of new pet turtles and spent hours with<br/>\nhim talking about them and playing with them, catching minnows to see if<br/>\nthey&#39;d eat them (they did) and MIL printed out a few pages from the internet<br/>\nabou them and just handed them over with no pushing.  She joked, &quot;Ok,<br/>\nschool&#39;s over.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI sort of sat there and went, &quot;Hey, I can enter this in my log and it&#39;s<br/>\nschool.  Cool.&quot;  Have to start thinking that way, &#39;cause we are in PA.<br/>\nDidn&#39;t have to do ANYTHING, but we can call it school.  Gotta love it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78487,"nextTopicId":78473}}
