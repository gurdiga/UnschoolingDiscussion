I thought I was a scarry monster or something that people were<br/>\ntrying to avoid me. (and since I really never make the attempt to join a circle,<br/>\nI usually can be found on the park bench alone) Makes me sort of happy that I am<br/>\nactually given the time to watch them at play.  And I agree with you, I would<br/>\nnot let my dd&#39;s play with that child either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe homeschooled kids haven&#39;t impressed me much either at<br/>\ntimes.  The dynamics of one group (unfortunately the one<br/>\nwhere my children&#39;s friends are) is not one I really like.<br/>\nThe mothers of the children sit in a circle and talk; the<br/>\nchildren play.  It doesn&#39;t seem to matter if their child is<br/>\n2 or 12 - little adult supervision is provided!  I try to<br/>\nstay near my children but with two it&#39;s hard to be in several<br/>\nplaces at the same time.  It would be nice if there were more<br/>\nadults in the playground area.  New mothers come to the group<br/>\nand either leave or start sitting in the circle leaving their<br/>\nlittles to fend for themselves - or get groused at for needing<br/>\ntheir mother&#39;s attention!<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of weeks ago a 11 year old child tried to choke and<br/>\npush an 8 year old off a fairly tall play structure (5 feet high<br/>\nat least).  She was his best friend&#39;s sister and he seems to have<br/>\nsome issues - not the first time he&#39;s done things to his friends&#39;<br/>\nsiblings.  His mother went and talked to him - and then came back<br/>\nto the circle and paid no attention to him the rest of the time<br/>\nthere!  Maybe I&#39;m an overprotective mother but this really, really<br/>\ndisturbed me.  I was talking to the 8 year old 10+ minutes after<br/>\nthe incident and she told me her neck still hurt.  My children will<br/>\nnot be near this child without me being there - ever!<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy Ferguson<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMessage boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\nCheck it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnother great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!

We used to have a regular<br/>\n&quot;palygroup&quot; once a week, but we quit going for a<br/>\nnumber of reasons, not the least of which being that<br/>\nit was TOO MUCH socialization for both the boys.  My<br/>\nshy and easy going child was overwhelmed, cried and<br/>\nhid.  My outgoing and hyperactive child was<br/>\noverstimulated and had melt downs.  Now we rely on<br/>\nweekly visits with one other family of two kids, whom<br/>\nwe all get along with great, as well as occassional<br/>\nvisits to the park and neighbors, and multi year<br/>\nvisits with cousins.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly I would not lament too much that there are not<br/>\nmore kids your daughter&#39;s age in the neighborhood if I<br/>\nwere you.  I have never been too impressed with the<br/>\npublic schooled neighbor kids behaviors around here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNor do I think an excess of socialization is required<br/>\nfor a child that age to be healthy and well developed<br/>\nsocially.  I think just a few friends with whom they<br/>\nspend time occassionally is great for this age.  I<br/>\nmean, kids this age are still mastering their social<br/>\nskills and focusing mostly on family relationships. <br/>\nToo many social encounters will leave a child that age<br/>\nstressed and exhausted.
