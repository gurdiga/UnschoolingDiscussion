The logistics?  My husband works outside the <br/>\nhome and I have my own business which I work around the kids.  However, <br/>\nanyone who has a business knows, the phone rings when it wants to and people <br/>\nwant to talk to me when they want to.  Do you schedule everything at night?  <br/>\nDo you work when the other is home and available for the kids?  Do you work <br/>\nonly weekends?   Does it only work if you both work out of the home?  Do you <br/>\ninvolve the kids in the business?  I&#39;ve been thinking that these are also <br/>\nsome concerns I have about how to balance both and not to hurt either.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9477,"nextTopicId":9470}}
