What area of early <br/>\nchildhood education have you worked?  I&#39;m a family child care <br/>\nprovider and mentor.  I just pulled my children (boy 9 and girl 7)out <br/>\nof school a couple of months ago.  I&#39;ve seen how well unschooling <br/>\nworks with preschoolers and know it will be very rewarding with my <br/>\nchildren in their &quot;school years&quot;.  Unschooling is one of those gut <br/>\nfeeling, know it in your heart, techniques that requires much trust.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s harder for me to trust a 9 year old than a 3 year old and I <br/>\nthink that comes from my public school upbringing.  That is my <br/>\nchallenge, to trust my children to know what they need.  Coming here <br/>\nhelps and meeting other unschoolers helps too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find this message board very informative and challenging to many of <br/>\nmy beliefs, which I love and need.<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95679678,"authorName":"alaurashome","from":"&quot;alaurashome&quot; &lt;alaurashome@...&gt;","profile":"alaurashome","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Hello -- new to list","postDate":"1024326948","msgId":38374,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFla3VmNCs2NDhpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNEMERENERGLjQwMDA0MDBAYWRlbHBoaWEubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":38373,"nextInTopic":38376,"prevInTime":38373,"nextInTime":38375,"topicId":38373,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... with ...

Our homeschooling ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1274791444\">Hi Everyone -<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d just like to introduce myself to the list.  I live in Virginia with <br/>\ntwo boys ages 12 and 8, my DH, and our dog and cat.  Our homeschooling <br/>\njourney began April 2001 when our oldest son finally convinced us that <br/>\nwe could do no worse by him.  Hsing was his idea -- and he even wrote a <br/>\nproposal outlining the positive and negative aspects of hsing. <br/>\n Actually, his proposal didn&#39;t include any negatives, and he had <br/>\ncounterarguments for every negative that I raised.  My youngest son was <br/>\nnot interested in hsing and wanted to continue to attend public school, <br/>\nand he just completed second grade.  After spending the past year <br/>\ndealing with teachers who are hyper-focused on standardized tests that <br/>\nhe&#39;s not even supposed to worry about until the end of the 3rd grade, <br/>\nhe&#39;s not interested in returning to ps.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was attracted to unschooling from the very first.  After spending the <br/>\nlast 10+ years in the field of early childhood education, I&#39;ve come to <br/>\nunderstand that children learn best when allowed to follow their own <br/>\npaths and the proper role for the educator is to provide a safe, <br/>\nlearning rich environment, observe the children for their interests and <br/>\nto provide opportunities to enrich their explorations of those <br/>\ninterests.  While I know in my bones that this is the best approach for <br/>\nmy children, I still struggle with a certain amount of ingrained <br/>\nschoolishness.  Hanging with other unschoolers is a great counterbalance <br/>\nfor that.      <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, hello to all -- I&#39;m happy to be here!<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Alicia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38357,"nextTopicId":38366}}
