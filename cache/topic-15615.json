I was raised in a fairly traditional<br/>\nway - even though my mom worked out of the home, she and I still did all<br/>\nthe &quot;housework&quot; while my three brothers did the &quot;yard work&quot;.  In high<br/>\nschool, my sports participation was drill team.  My brothers wrestled,<br/>\nran track, and climbed mountains.  Now I have only daughters.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>\ncare less about sports, although I do humor dh by trying to at least be<br/>\naware of which sport is in season.  Besides the sports, because I&#39;m SAHM<br/>\nwhile dh works out, I end up doing all the housework!  My dh&#39;s mom was<br/>\nthe one who was out in the yard throwing a baseball with him and sitting<br/>\nin the stands watching all his games, so he believes it is the mother&#39;s<br/>\njob to be the sports coach too.  Children&#39;s soccer is HUGE here and he&#39;s<br/>\nbeen pressuring me to get dd into a soccer league.  I&#39;m not anti-soccer,<br/>\nbut not thrilled about the idea of being a soccer mom, and dd hasn&#39;t been<br/>\nbegging to do it anyway.  I keep telling dh that if he wants her to play<br/>\nsoccer he should make it happen - sign her up, get her to practice, kick<br/>\nthe ball around the yard with her, etc.  Of course, practices are in the<br/>\nafternoon while he&#39;s still at work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I would like to raise my daughters to be physically active.
