One also needs<br/>\n&gt; to be aware that withdrawal syptoms from carbohydrates will<br/>\n&gt; probably arise, along with the effects of said toxins.  I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; followed the diet fully, but have felt considerably better since<br/>\n&gt; stopping eating regular breakfast cereal and eating omelette or<br/>\n&gt; bacon or ham.  I think this is becoming a circular argument, since<br/>\n&gt; I believe I&#39;ve said this before.  Yes it could be the reduction of<br/>\n&gt; milk in my diet from cutting out cereal, but I think it&#39;s the protein-<br/>\n&gt; balance that&#39;s more critical to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tracy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 15 Jul 2000, at 18:02, aworthen wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but isn&#39;t it bad to cut out<br/>\n&gt; all carbs?
