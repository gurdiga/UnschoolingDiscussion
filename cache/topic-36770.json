My oldest daughter came home one day, when she was about 14, <br/>\nand said, &quot;I just can&#39;t BELIEVE there are all these PEOPLE there who know so <br/>\nmuch and they are getting PAID to share it with students.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then she&#39;s run into a few bad teachers - but really, for the most part, <br/>\nshe&#39;s had incredibly good teachers who inspired her and really have passions <br/>\nand are there to share them. AND - this is a community college. It costs $11 <br/>\nper unit for an 18-week semester. A typical class is three units - so it is <br/>\ntypically $33 for each class. Full-time attendance  - 12 or 15 units would be <br/>\nwell under $200 per semester, so we&#39;re not talking about big bucks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter has spent a year and a half on a debate team - that was a <br/>\nWONDERFUL and challenging experience. She has been in two different vocal <br/>\nperformance groups - jazz and musical theater. She designed lighting for a <br/>\ndance concert and ran the light board for a number of plays and other <br/>\nperformances. She&#39;s had her mural photographs displayed at a Laguna Beach <br/>\ngallery. She&#39;s taken 8 semesters of ceramics, gotten a good job because of <br/>\nher ceramics expertise and twice been invited to the home of Paul Soldner <br/>\n(known as the Father of American Raku). All of these opportunities came about <br/>\nbecause of going to community college. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are so many opportunities on our college campus - and we have a little <br/>\ntiny not-particularly-spectacular community college. My second daughter is <br/>\nnow just getting involved there - she is learning website design and computer <br/>\nprogramming from a man who is a GREAT teacher - she&#39;s thrilled with his <br/>\nability to help her &quot;get&quot; things that she&#39;s read but not thoroughly <br/>\nunderstood. She has an opera class - learning about opera, not performing it <br/>\n- from a young woman who sings opera herself and gets her students lots of <br/>\ndiscounted tickets to all kinds of musicals and operas and other singing <br/>\nperformances. We saw &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; a few weeks ago at the Los Angeles <br/>\nMusic Center and we have tickets for Camelot in a couple of weeks. Also, her <br/>\nbeginning voice class is collaborating with a sound recording class to make a <br/>\nclass cd.

Not because he knew how too spell.  One teacher told me he would probably never be a good speller because if a child is going to be a good speller it happens at the beginning - they either spell good or they don&#39;t.  Another teacher told me that he&#39;s not a good speller because he never ABSORBED the phonics of spelling, that anybody can spell good if the phonics are taught EARLY.  Well, in my opinion he doesn&#39;t spell because he doesn&#39;t yet see the importance of doing it.  He is 14 and still spells the way words sound.  That doesn&#39;t bother him and FINALLY it doesn&#39;t bother me.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But what&#39;s the rush? What great enhancement to their joy &gt;in life will they<br/>\n&gt;have if they enter college at 15 instead of 18 (or 20 or &gt;25)? Is it a<br/>\n&gt;competition to get as many work years in as possible &gt;before retirement<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At our church there are a couple of kids graduating from public High School this year.  I ask one of the boys what he planned to do afterwards and he siad,  &quot;:Well, I guess I&#39;ll go to college&quot;  I asked what he planned to major in and he said &quot; I think math and my mionr will be religion&quot;  I said &quot;oh, that&#39;s interesting what are you palnning to do with that when you finish?  Teach?&quot;  He said, &quot;Oh, Gosh no, I don&#39;t know what I want to do yet.  Math is just something that I like and thought would be easy and studying religion is just something I thought I might gst a kick out of.&quot;  <br/>\nI know of several young peoiple who have gone into college right after HS then come out and do something entirely different with their lives while paying off the debt of student loans for studying something that means NOTHING to them now!  DOES THIS MAKE SOME KIND OF SENSE THAT I MISSED??? <br/>\nI don&#39;t care if my son goes to college or not!! I do care that he will be able to do something with his life that makes him happy.  If that means college in order to achieve that then I&#39;ll do all I can to help him.  If it means Technical school, so be  it.  Whatever!  But to go to college just for the sake of going to college, to me is a gross waste of time, money and INTELLIGENCE!.<br/>\n  High Schools do not teach children to think for themselves.  They are not allowed to reason anything outside of a textbook.  Some are not ready, academically OR mature enough , to take on deciding what they&#39;re going to do with the rest of their lives.  They&#39;ve never been allowed to think about what they REALLY want  to do.  Only what&#39;s EXPECTED of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat joy is there in being young if you are in college by the ripe old age of 15 and by the time you finish you&#39;re BARELY old enough to enter the work force.  Seems to me they going to miss some really great years when they could have been KIDS!<br/>\n<br/>\nBetty<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":55326806,"authorName":"rumpleteasermom","from":"&quot;rumpleteasermom&quot; &lt;rumpleteasermom@...&gt;","profile":"rumpleteasermom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Spelling & college","postDate":"1020692726","msgId":36774,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFiNjFkbSs0dDJmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEI4RkJFQ0E0Ljg2MjUlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":36771,"nextInTopic":36775,"prevInTime":36773,"nextInTime":36775,"topicId":36770,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, I go to college because I enjoy it.
