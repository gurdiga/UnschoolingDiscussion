I hope in the future when conflict arises we will be able to handle these situations in the moment and part confident that each of us is helping our children learn to live  together.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point I&#39;m not sure where to go. I do what to keep this simple. I&#39;ll have to decide if I want to hand deliver this and possibly get involved in dialog with her or through the mail, what do you think? At this point I think she is pretty fired up towards me and I really do not want to have my kids around a mother with so much angst kicking. .<br/>\nThank you for the ideas, this is just what I wanted. I have yet to act on this and have not called her or seen her. I was the only eye witness parent, though some 5 year old kids were near by. I am so shocked she felt I didn&#39;t sound concerned. I think she wanted to see me yell and scold him in public and force him to say sorry when he was still really mad. I have learned to let my son cool off alone, he is that type and he knows when he is ready to come back and deal with what he created. I left him sitting under a tree collecting his thoughts. I also was busily gathering my stuff because I needed to pick up my older daughter and was now late. <br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":102372243,"authorName":"deedeanne","from":"&quot;deedeanne&quot; &lt;deedeanne@...&gt;","profile":"deedeanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Mary&#39;s support group problem","postDate":"1104243416","msgId":101827,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNxcnBzbytjOXM3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":101841,"prevInTime":101826,"nextInTime":101828,"topicId":101827,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Mary, I just wanted to say that Sandra s idea of a written apology and a letter to the group about trying to avoid future situations are great ideas. ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1689720948\">Hi Mary,<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to say that Sandra&#39;s idea of a written apology and a <br/>\nletter to the group about trying to avoid future situations are <br/>\ngreat ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nCalling the police was an extreme response, and the comment that <br/>\nconselors have been involved, indicate that there may be more going <br/>\non with this mother and son than meets the eye. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a neighbor that called the police after her son gave the <br/>\nfinger to my son and his friends riding by on their bikes. They gave <br/>\nit back. I was sitting in the driveway with my little ones and saw <br/>\nit all. A few minutes later, the mom came out yelling, &quot;This <br/>\nharrassment has got to stop, or I&#39;m gonna call the cops.&quot; She <br/>\nproceeded to tell me how the boys had given her son the finger &quot;for <br/>\nno reason.&quot;  She couldn&#39;t see from her window that her son did it <br/>\nfirst. Anyway, I set her straight, and she didn&#39;t like that. About <br/>\n15 minutes later, the police were at her house taking her complaint. <br/>\nThis mother has called the police at least 6 times in the last year <br/>\non various children in the neighborhood. Her son is unable to get <br/>\nalong with anyone in the neighborhood, and her way of working it out <br/>\nhas been to make him a victim, and look to the police to &quot;solve&quot; the <br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea if your situation is the same, but talking to other <br/>\ngroup members, and working to improve the dynamics of the group can <br/>\nonly help. Maybe other group members have had similar experiences <br/>\nwith this child/parent, or concerns about playground sharing that <br/>\nthey want to address too. Also, having a written apology on file is <br/>\ngood for legal purposes. (The police call scared us alot. We called <br/>\nour brother who is a lawyer and he told us to just keep a written <br/>\nrecord of everything. That would be the best thing to do. That, and <br/>\nof course, stay away from the kid, which I already emphasized!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMost importantly, I agree with others who suggest maybe skipping the <br/>\npark days if your child is not enjoying it. But talk about it first. <br/>\nFind out if there were more guidelines about sharing, if parents <br/>\njumped in more to help resolve conflicts sooner, if he would enjoy <br/>\nit more. If there is anything that would make it better for your <br/>\nchild, find out what it is. If not, maybe it&#39;s time to take a break.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck to you!<br/>\n<br/>\nDeanne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101713,"nextTopicId":101877}}
