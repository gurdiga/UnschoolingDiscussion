He&#39;s <br/>\nrepaired/modified a few of his own as well as one belonging to a <br/>\nfriends&#39; kid. He does good work and he&#39;s VERY meticulous.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, he can&#39;t start charging for the service until he gets some <br/>\nmore experience. So if anyone has an electric guitar in need of <br/>\nrepair lmk and I&#39;ll pass on the info so he can decide whether or not <br/>\nit&#39;s a repair he can handle. All you&#39;d have to pay for is shipping <br/>\n(we&#39;re in Utah) and parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny takers??? Beth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49696,"nextTopicId":49779}}
