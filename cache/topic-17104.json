It&#39;s <br/>\nabout following their interests and trusting them, that <br/>\nif they need or want to know something they&#39;ll find a <br/>\nway to find it out.  Our role is as facilitator, like <br/>\nthe great stories about the train-obsessed boys!  Those <br/>\n&#39;let&#39;s go look it up!&#39; sessions...  I have a similar <br/>\nthing with my dd and dinosaurs atm, we got a DK CD on <br/>\ndinosaurs cheap with a newspaper, and now she quotes to <br/>\nanyone who&#39;ll listen, and wants to know anything and <br/>\neverything there is to know about dinosaurs *grin*  We <br/>\nwent to the UK&#39;s National Museum of Photography, Film <br/>\nand Television on Friday, and she was more interested <br/>\nin the model dinosaurs used in 10 million years BC (or <br/>\nwhatever it&#39;s called!) (oh, we saw the Art of Star Wars <br/>\nexhibition while were there, spendy but good, real <br/>\nproduction models of the ships and costumes and stuff, <br/>\nwish I hadn&#39;t been dragged round by the kids who wanted <br/>\nto look at something else...)  So I don&#39;t do &#39;maths&#39; or <br/>\n&#39;reading&#39; or &#39;writing&#39; or any other subject, we just <br/>\nlive our lives and follow what we&#39;re into.  And you <br/>\nknow what, it really works!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaths, Linda, you&#39;ve had great suggestions about how <br/>\nyou can deal with maths in real-life ways.  Now I <br/>\nwonder if you can let go of the idea that it&#39;s <br/>\nnecessary to think about it in this way, and just do <br/>\nthose things without turning your life into a series of <br/>\n&#39;educational experiences.&#39;  (I think it&#39;s very easy for <br/>\nhome-edders to fall into this pattern, and it&#39;s a very <br/>\nquick route to burn-out.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeschooling is a natural process which will occur if <br/>\nit&#39;s allowed to.  You can&#39;t deschool your son, nor make <br/>\nhim deschool, it would defeat the object I think.  <br/>\nGiven that (can someone back me up on this, I keep <br/>\nquoting it and I need to know if others concur) <br/>\ndeschooling is said to take around a month for each <br/>\nyear of institutionalised school, you can give both you <br/>\nand him at least until August to shed whatever <br/>\npreconceptions about learning and issues of self-image <br/>\nand self-worth have been gathered in his time at <br/>\nschool, before even thinking about assessing any <br/>\n&#39;progress.&#39;  It&#39;s my guess that in that time, he&#39;ll <br/>\nhave rediscovered enough of himself and his interests <br/>\nto be doing stuff on his own initiative.  Simply <br/>\nsupport whatever he&#39;s doing and try not to worry when <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t seem to be doing anything, many people&#39;s <br/>\nbrains work best when they don&#39;t appear to be doing <br/>\nanything!  (Those vacant driftings-off are actually <br/>\ntimes of brain development, or so I read a couple of <br/>\nyears ago, and it&#39;s important not to interrupt them.  <br/>\nUnfortunately if I left my dd until she came out of <br/>\nsuch fugues, the cats would come and eat her tea from <br/>\nher plate without her knowing, and we&#39;d never go <br/>\nanywhere!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I hope this helps in some way, even if it&#39;s not <br/>\nwhat either of you were asking in the first place!<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Vaughnde Edwards","from":"&quot;Vaughnde Edwards&quot; &lt;stampinbookworm@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"xNAJb66XVDd1J6C-aXIMNQ0ATii5JqO93YaFRjIHeGI-BB9bshlYvfIKpF98S-DqZUNesPE4N9JkobOGN4glxzEIgBUYJZv7knaN1Tf0izVz7sDxpKitz9Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschoolers in preschool, was Re: Bonnie","postDate":"985452027","msgId":17214,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWMwMWMwYjQ4MSQyMmYxNjQ4MCRhZTY3YThjMEBqZXNzaWNhPg=="},"prevInTopic":17205,"nextInTopic":17221,"prevInTime":17213,"nextInTime":17215,"topicId":17104,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sit down with your son and ask him to help you make up a calendar.
