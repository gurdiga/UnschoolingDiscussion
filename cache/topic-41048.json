I have lost alot of <br/>\nme....of who I was and who am suppose to be. BEcause of the assumilation, but <br/>\nit is slowly being washed away, but it is taking ALOT of time. I was battling <br/>\nthe demons so to speak....on one side my spirit guides trying to guide me and <br/>\nthen the other side of religions trying to control me and my thoughts and <br/>\ntelling me that they are wrong. It was wrong to talk to your spirit <br/>\nguides/ancestors.<br/>\nI was hurt when I was told that I could no longer celebrate Kwanzaa....my <br/>\nethinicity was stripped. <br/>\nIt&#39;s all about control and I can admit that it works and I am fighting HARD <br/>\nto be free.........<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace ALL<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41044,"nextTopicId":41052}}
