I broke my ankle last October, was casted for almost <br/>\n8 weeks and even now have trouble walking too far.  It doesn&#39;t help (the <br/>\nwalking) that I&#39;m pregnant, but that&#39;s almost over.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat worked for me was shifting my activities to stuff indoors.  Lots of <br/>\ncrafty stuff, board games, word games, making up songs, putting on music for the <br/>\nkids to dance to (they liked putting on shows), arranging play dates for the <br/>\nthe 4 year old who would leave the house without me, having help come in, having <br/>\na dear friend stay with us for a couple of weeks.  Yes, you need to mourn for <br/>\nthe things you&#39;ll be missing until you heal properly, but you also need to <br/>\nmove on and figure out things you CAN do with the children.  And then do them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s depressing and not where you want to be right now, I know.  But it will <br/>\nend as long as the arm heals.  I&quot;m looking forward to getting my plates, <br/>\nscrews and pins out in about six months or so after the baby.  Then I&quot;ll feel more <br/>\nnormal and will be able to function better with my cherubs.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164396504,"authorName":"Elizabeth Roberts","from":"Elizabeth Roberts &lt;mamabethuscg@...&gt;","profile":"mamabethuscg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] OT, need some kind words and ideas","postDate":"1074071814","msgId":88807,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTE0MDkxNjU0LjY4MTExLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEyNjAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDdlLjQ0ZmIxYjlhLjJkMzYzZGYwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":88800,"nextInTopic":89002,"prevInTime":88806,"nextInTime":88808,"topicId":88800,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Nancy, First of all, HUGS to you!
