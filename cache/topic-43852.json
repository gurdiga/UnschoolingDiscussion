We used to play soccer with our friend Nathan,<br/>\nwhen he was 4. He proclaimed himself goalie whenever he wanted to pick up<br/>\nthe ball, and if Rain had tried she could have dribbled circles around<br/>\nhim.

To me, reading a bob book from cover to cover and calling it reading is not the same thing as riding a stationary bike and calling it &quot;riding a bike.&quot;  When my middle son learned to ride a bike he did it very gradually, and for a while he would pedal for a short time and then need to put his feet down to catch himself before he tried again.

My first son picked up reading effortlessly... it seemed like he went from not reading at all to reading whatever he wanted.  My second son is approaching it differently... he *isn&#39;t* picking it up as quickly/suddenly as his brother but his interest is *much* greater.  He talks about it all the time... if he &quot;reads&quot; a stop sign, and says &quot;I just read that, didn&#39;t I?!&quot; who am I to tell him, &quot;well you&#39;re not really reading unless you can pick up any newspaper or full length novel and read it.&quot; <br/>\nI think that reading a bob book *is* reading, albeit in the early stages, and for some kids it gives them a feeling of success and encouragement to be able to read something, even if it&#39;s something simple, a baby step.

It&#39;s just like my niece had this <br/>\nbig major problem with my baby being 3 months younger than hers and Alyssa <br/>\nwould already be crawling and walking when her&#39;s wasn&#39;t. She would actually <br/>\ncall her baby lazy and made a big deal out of it. I&#39;ve had 3 kids walk at 8 <br/>\nmonths and 1 at a year. They&#39;re all walking fine now. 1 very early talker <br/>\nand 3 very late talkers. The late &quot;bloomers&quot; will give the early one a run <br/>\nfor her money anyday with their mouths!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI see it the same with learning. I know homeschool kids that started reading <br/>\nat 5 and others not until 12. By the time they&#39;re 18, you can&#39;t tell the <br/>\ndifference and they are all reading. So why wonder what level, because I <br/>\nthink if it does matter, if they are &quot;below&quot; one might not unschool like <br/>\nthey did before.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a sight from the World Book I think it was where they list for each <br/>\ngrade level what children &quot;should&quot; be learning. When the kids were little, <br/>\nlike 4, I would check this sight and see that they already knew stuff ahead <br/>\nof what was mentioned. Then I started to think about what difference it made <br/>\nand thought about what we are doing here and how I feel about it. Haven&#39;t <br/>\nlooked at it since.<br/>\n<br/>\nI once asked my husband, (to see if we were on the same wavelength) before <br/>\nour 2 were reading, what would happen if they were 12 and still not reading? <br/>\nHe said he would have no problem with that. He said if they got to be 18, <br/>\nthen he might start worrying!!!
