Do not have illicit sexual relations (this does not refer to premarital sex by the way, it refers to a specific list of illicit acts).<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  Do not eat the limb of a living animal (this is to discourage animal cruelty).<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  Do not commit theft<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  Do not blaspheme, which means not using G-d&#39;s name to curse Him or any of His creation.  (G-d&#39;s name is more than just the term &quot;G-d&quot;._<br/>\n<br/>\n 7.

So he convened the first ecumenical (empire-wide) <br/>\n    council of all the bishops of the church and asked them to set forth the <br/>\n    beliefs and practices of the church.

They produced a canon of Scripture by comparing the <br/>\n    books read in the local Christian assemblies.   In the battle against <br/>\n    gnosticism Christian assemblies had already agreed to four canonical gospels <br/>\n    and excluded gospels they regarded as gnostic.  They accepted the canon of <br/>\n    Old Testament books that the Jewish rabbis had already established, although <br/>\n    they changed the order in the Old Testament so that the prophetic books came <br/>\n    last.  They believed that all of these books in the Old and now in the <br/>\n    canonized New Testaments were inspired.  The bishops affirmed the doctrine of <br/>\n    the Trinity (which necessarily includes the co-divinity of Christ with the <br/>\n    Father and the Holy Spirit) by appealing to the statements in the gospels and <br/>\n    epistles and the devotional practices of their people.  Confessing one God in <br/>\n    three co-equal persons excluded the Arians who taught that the Son was <br/>\n    subordinate to the Father.
