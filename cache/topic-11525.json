The both of you!  Isn&#39;t it gut-wrenching to have to decline<br/>\nyour baby&#39;s request for a nursing, when you know you can provide her<br/>\nwith what she needs?  Several years back I had a similar situation with<br/>\nmy daughter who needed major dental work, under general anesthesia.  It<br/>\nbroke my heart to hear her crying in the night and I had to ignore her<br/>\npleas!  (My husband slept with her as I thought that might make it<br/>\neasier for her to not expect a nursing...)  Thank goodness it&#39;s over<br/>\nwith and you can make it up to Casey...Hope you&#39;re both feeling better<br/>\nsoon!<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia<br/>\n<br/>\nPS...The other difficult thing I had to deal with back then was when I<br/>\ntried to nurse my daughter in recovery and later at home, and after all<br/>\nthe work that had been done to her mouth, she couldn&#39;t nurse very well! <br/>\nWe both cried when she lamented to me, &quot;Mama, I can&#39;t nurse anymore!&quot; <br/>\nIt took her a week to make the adjustment and learn to nurse again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; aworthen wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi all. Just wanted to let you know that our littlest darling (2 yo<br/>\n&gt; Casey) had surgery-ear tubes-this morning. All went well and she came<br/>\n&gt; through with flying colors. We were home from the hospital by 9:30<br/>\n&gt; a.m. The only thing that was a prob. was that she couldn&#39;t nurse after<br/>\n&gt; midnight, so when she wanted to at 3 am she got really upset. In her<br/>\n&gt; anger she manged to wake up fully and kept us up from that point on.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m typing this at 1:30 pm and it feels like the end of the day. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; already had a 2 hr. nap. :)<br/>\n&gt; Amy<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11510,"nextTopicId":11527}}
