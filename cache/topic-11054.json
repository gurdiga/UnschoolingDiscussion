However Jobs like that <br/>\nare also usually seasonal so SAVE SOME MONEY!  My DH&#39;s little Brother works <br/>\nfor VECO which is an oil company.  He spends a month on the slope then a <br/>\nweek at home and goes back up but that is how he choses to do it, Im not <br/>\nsure that that is the regular way it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;I understand the homeschool laws are quite favorable in AK.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes!!  AK has some of the best homeschooling laws I have seen.   You are <br/>\nfree to homeschool your child in AK however you see fit. NO STRINGS <br/>\nATTATCHED.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;What can you tell me about actual living conditions?  What to look out for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and what to look forward to?&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As far as living conditions go, I lived in some pretty crappy places right <br/>\nafter hubby and I got married and I was never COLD.  Most houses are VERY <br/>\nwell insulated.   If you live in the lower half of the state the cold isn&#39;t <br/>\nreally that bad as it is a DRY cold instead of a Wet cold that gets you to <br/>\nyour bones.  The weather in my hometown (Wasilla) can get pretty cold but <br/>\nbuy a good coat and some snow boots and you will be just fine. (Gloves would <br/>\nbe a good idea too) Alaska has become very commercialized in the past decade <br/>\nso you can also get anything you need there.  In fact I found more shopping <br/>\nopportunities there than I did after moving stateside!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;I have a medical condition...FMS (fibromyalgia syndrome)&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI really do not know anything about this but my Mom  works in the medical <br/>\nfield in AK and I could ask her if she knows anything about how the weather <br/>\nmight affect that if you want me to.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Cost of living...I understand is high...? &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, in some cases the cost of living is high but I have found that it is <br/>\nnot extravigantly higher except for housing prices.   I had a one room <br/>\napartment in AK that was $625.00  a month in rent in AK, but had a 3 bedroom <br/>\nin Arkansas for $350.00   However that is why you make more money in AK to <br/>\ncompensate for that.   For Grocery stores ect.  I really didn&#39;t  notice too <br/>\nmuch of a difference in prices.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Is housing hard to find?  I would<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;assume homes are pretty well insulated against the cold?  We would have to<br/>\n&gt;rent, if that makes any difference.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Like I said earlier, the houses are very well insulated with most having <br/>\ngood heaters.  I would reccomend AGAINST a trailer if you were considering <br/>\nit.  They seem to have a lot of fires in trailers.   Anyway, The economy is <br/>\nbooming in AK right now so finding a place to live should be an easy task.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;I&#39;m sure there are zillions of questions I should ask,&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk away!!

When I was there once and did not<br/>\nbreak a sweat the whole time and we had to walk<br/>\neverywhere we went. I was on a church trip there as a<br/>\nyouth and had traveled by bus. If we wanted to go<br/>\nanywhere the group wasn&#39;t going we walked. I was<br/>\namazed when I looked up at temp on the bank and it was<br/>\n102. Here in Houston at 85 you walk outside and it is<br/>\nlike walking into a sauna literaly. You walk outside<br/>\nand there is instantly moistur on your skin. Many days<br/>\nwe have humidity in the 80-90%.

Heat can kill you!  I know this<br/>\nbecause despite our sometimes baking-hot summers (we&#39;re currently<br/>\nenjoying 90 degree temps), our winters can be fowl.  It sometimes can<br/>\nget to 40 below...and my husband and others I know who suffer from<br/>\nFibromyalgia are much more comfortable.  No one likes it THAT cold, but<br/>\nanything below zero is usually an improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia in Saskatchewan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:braunville@...\">braunville@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; My apologies to anyone that gets this in multiples...I&#39;m seeking first hand<br/>\n&gt; info quickly, so sending this message to more than one list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; DH is applying for 3 jobs in Alaska.   (We NEED a job, I might add...almost a<br/>\n&gt; year of earnestly seeking employment is getting old!)  One job is on Cook<br/>\n&gt; Inlet, the other two are rotational on the north slope.  I anticipate that<br/>\n&gt; both north slope jobs would have him going alone and flying home during time<br/>\n&gt; off.  Having never been there or done this sort of thing, I&#39;d be interested<br/>\n&gt; if anyone has info on whether that is typically how things are done and if so<br/>\n&gt; (or not) any suggestions on what to expect.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I understand the homeschool laws are quite favorable in AK.  We&#39;ve wanted to<br/>\n&gt; move there for over 20 years and it appears to be a real possibility this<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What can you tell me about actual living conditions?  What to look out for<br/>\n&gt; and what to look forward to?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a medical condition...FMS (fibromyalgia syndrome).  If anyone has<br/>\n&gt; first hand experience on how living in very cold weather affects them or<br/>\n&gt; someone they know with FMS, that would be very helpful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cost of living...I understand is high...?  Is housing hard to find?  I would<br/>\n&gt; assume homes are pretty well insulated against the cold?  We would have to<br/>\n&gt; rent, if that makes any difference.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure there are zillions of questions I should ask, but beyond these, I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know where to start!  so, any information is helpful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; TIA<br/>\n&gt; Eiraul<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Life&#39;s too short to send boring email.
