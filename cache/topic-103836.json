And it couldn&#39;t have come at a better time.  <br/>\nMy 7yo ds has always made books, even at two years old, he&#39;d draw <br/>\npictures, and either dictate to me or make his own &quot;writing&quot; to tell <br/>\nthe story.  (the one I remember the most was a few pages of us at <br/>\nthe grocery store, each page a different step of shopping...at the <br/>\nend of the book he wrote the letters &quot;DN&quot; meaning &quot;the end&quot;...I <br/>\nloved that!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, when he started first grade, we had meet the teacher day.  <br/>\nShe told us one of her favorite things to do was to teach the kids <br/>\nhow to write stories.  Her method included a story web, where they <br/>\nwrite their ideas, and go on from there...sloppy copies, good print, <br/>\nillustration, and eventually publishing (transferring all this into <br/>\na hard cover &quot;real&quot; book, very exciting).  Well, they start this at <br/>\nschool, I get a phone call Nick wanted to do the first step at home, <br/>\nhe was having a hard time &quot;getting his thoughts together&quot;, they <br/>\nthought he&#39;d do better at home.  Then another conversation about how <br/>\nhe wants to illustrate, but that&#39;s not the step they are on, and how <br/>\nhe&#39;s just not cooperating with them during writing time, he&#39;s not <br/>\nfocused enough.  We had been struggling with this writing project <br/>\nuntil the day he left school (last week).  He actually got his <br/>\nprogress report that Monday (and I&#39;m so happy to be able to <br/>\nsay...and believe...that the report doesn&#39;t matter, but it is <br/>\nrelevant to what I&#39;m getting at) and his progress report showed <br/>\nimprovement in everything, except writing.  The teachers are <br/>\nconcerned and say he needs help in this area.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know he doesn&#39;t...or at least he didn&#39;t until now!  After reading <br/>\nthis article, I am hoping so hard he won&#39;t have lasting impressions <br/>\nfrom this project.  Poor kid.  I&#39;m so glad I DID take them out now, <br/>\ninstead of finishing out the year.

I skated around the edge of the rink a few times (badly, <br/>\nlol--I don&#39;t have very good coordination) and then just chose to hang <br/>\nout at the rink without rollerskating anymore.  An adult figured <br/>\nthere must be something wrong that I wasn&#39;t skating, and he tried to <br/>\nget me to go out into the rink.  I politely said no many, many times <br/>\nbut he just kept after me to go out and try.  When he dropped me off, <br/>\nhe told my mom that he tried to get me to go out and skate more but <br/>\nthat I wouldn&#39;t.  My mom was embarassed, and afterwards kept on me <br/>\nabout why I wouldn&#39;t let him take me out to rollerskate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember how awful I felt then, feeling like there must be <br/>\nsomething wrong with me because I hadn&#39;t wanted to rollerskate with <br/>\nthat guy.

It sounds like for your kids being home just feels right, like for you, getting out some just feels right.  We all have to be okay the way we are.  And that includes you too.  But you have the ability to wait knowing that your day will come.  But if you can manage to get out a bit without dragging them with you, all the better.  If not, see how your kids take it when you have someone come over instead.  That could meet your extrovert need for outside interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for sharing your situation.

If it&#39;s a deep fear or an oncoming flu or a need to hole up at home, that should be seen and honored.&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is something I have been thinking about but haven&#39;t been able to get time to post.  I think it is reasonable to talk to the child about all the factors involved and to see if they might really like to go once having broken through the surface of some minor resistance.  But if the child really persists in not wanting to go, and says he would go to get the hot dog but then wants to come straight home, I would have to respect that.  We never know what is lurking beneath the surface with them, and sometimes it might be the flu or something else we might feel horrible about if discovered after forcible playdating, and so I think we will always do well to really listen to our children and honor their needs and wishes about such things, just like in everything else, like food and TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also agree about getting over the embarrassment thing.  I mean, so what if we&#39;re embarrassed?  What message do I send my child if I choose to force her to go because I don&#39;t want to be embarrassed?  I think it says I care more about what other people think than about her.  I personally think that anyone we would be playdating with would understand if my child really strongly wanted to cancel.  If they couldn&#39;t be understanding about that, then I am not sure why we would be hanging out with them anyway.  I think I would ask my child if they would be okay with the other folks coming over to our house, and if so, then invite the other family to come over instead of going over there, if the orginal plan wasn&#39;t an option.  If this was something that happened often I would talk to my child about the impact on the other people and really ask her if she was sure before making plans again.... along with warning everyone that we only make plans if we can be flexible about it.  Our good friends are like this such that their daughter is highly sensitive and intense and is very very easily overwhelmed.  When something doesn&#39;t feel right to her she gets panicky-like and is clearly miserable.  So when she changes her mind about something and doesn&#39;t want to come play, we honor that.  To force her to come would be a miserable experience for everyone.  Instead, we ask her what she would like to do and then leave it to her and my child to decide what they can agree on.  Very rarely can they not find something, unless one of them is getting sick.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: embarrassment & karate WAS: Re: Manipulation","postDate":"1109020186","msgId":103854,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNGODhGRkY3LjNBQzg1MDE1LjBCOTdBM0ZCQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103845,"nextInTopic":103856,"prevInTime":103853,"nextInTime":103855,"topicId":103836,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

When I was the one organizing the playgroup (for years) we HAD to be there, and it was more pressure than was fun, but it also helped getting the kids out of the house, to know that they DID want to claim the best tables and make sure there wasn&#39;t glass where the toddlers would play.  It was a responsibility that perked them up lots of times, but eventually they got tired of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to alternate plans so that everyone knows what to expect, it seems it could be overplanning and MORE frustration and negotiation.  Plans made the night before can be all different when the morning comes and one kid&#39;s puking and the freeway&#39;s closed and someone left something plastic on the stove and it&#39;s melted and stuck.  Flexibility itself can be a plan, and it&#39;s good for families to learn to walk lightly on the surface of the world instead of claiming a spot and expecting it not to change.  Things change.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think parents should be honest with kids, and kind to them, and also persuade them not to be huge inconveniences to others around them on a little whim.   It helps kids be honest with parents and others, if they&#39;re expected to say WHY they don&#39;t want to go, instead of having the power to cancel a family&#39;s whole day with a light poof of &quot;I think I&#39;m not in the mood.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe they don&#39;t know why and can&#39;t be articulate, and in those cases the parents do best when they can gauge the depth of the objection, and the emotion of the resistence.

If you&#39;re his coach and he&#39;s &quot;signed up for the team,&quot; you could think of it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way to look at it is that maybe he&#39;s really NOT ready, and a karate teacher won&#39;t want a kid who&#39;s not really there. It won&#39;t really help the class or the kid for him to be there against his will, if that&#39;s the case.   And adulthood isn&#39;t too late to take karate.  If he wants to learn later, he can.  And karate isn&#39;t necessary to life.  It can be very cool for those who are into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t obsess about the one point of going or not going.  Look at the realities all around it.

Children aren&#39;t *trying* to embarrass you. They&#39;re just being who they are (unlike many parents who seem to go out of their ways to be huge embarrassments to their teenagers). <br/>\n<br/>\n*YOU* may feel embarrassed, but your child didn&#39;t *cause* it. It&#39;s your *own* reaction. Leave the kid out of it!<br/>\n<br/>\nEmbarrassment is something *we* projest onto ourselves---NOT something someone else projects onto us.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd my little embarrassment rant!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the karate possiblities: I would telephone the instructor and let him know *in advance* that the child who is interested in the class has a hard time with transitions, that he might not feel comfortable going---and that he might decide to not show up. I would advise him on all this stuff before even making the first appointment. If the instructor blows you off, find another instructor---one who is willing to deal with your child&#39;s sensitive issues. If he&#39;s willing to work with him, you child will probably sense it and *want* to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing with playgroups: let them know in advance that your kids *may* not want to go at the last minute. Plan out options *IN ADVANCE* so that everyone knows what to expect. Insisting on going to the &quot;anti-technology house&quot; and engaging in trickery because of being too embarrassed to be honest is creepy.
