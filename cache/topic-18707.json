You download a free desktop organizer, and then you <br/>\ncan choose whatever photographs you want. They&#39;ll be your screensaver <br/>\nand your wallpaper. The wallpaper changes daily, unless you change <br/>\nit, and the screensaver changes as frequently as you want it to. What <br/>\nI think makes this of interest to unschoolers is that we chose mostly <br/>\nanimal pictures, and the kids are getting interested in all sorts of <br/>\nanimals they hadn&#39;t really been familiar with before. There are other <br/>\ncategories to choose from, too, like insects, nature, water and sky, <br/>\nholidays, people, fire, storms, etc. And you can put your own <br/>\npictures on there, too. Just thought some of you might want to check <br/>\nit out. Juli</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18680,"nextTopicId":18716}}
