I enjoyed the books<br/>\n&gt; and the movie. I also like tons of other books about adventure, and<br/>\n&gt; sometimes magic. I like the Chronicles of Narnia, the Half Magic<br/>\n&gt; series, the Borrowers series, The Castle in the Attic, so many more.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m glad my 6y loves to read also. She is just getting into some of<br/>\n&gt; these old favorites.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I put off Potter though, not forbidden, just not suggested yet either.<br/>\n&gt; She bought a copy now because I took her to the movie. I guess I<br/>\n&gt; thought parts of it were not great for some young kids. I think most<br/>\n&gt; kids are fine with the evil and violence, but my 4 & 6y kids are still<br/>\n&gt; very real based. I mean that they worry that it&#39;s real somehow. I took<br/>\n&gt; them because the movie looked like it would convey some of the magic in<br/>\n&gt; the story. Maybe the basics of the story have been told by others many<br/>\n&gt; times before, but the details are what bring it to life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What does this have to do with unschooling? Well I guess it&#39;s about<br/>\n&gt; reading for fun, writing your own adventure stories, doing the math to<br/>\n&gt; save up for a toy, discussing the psychology of how ads make people<br/>\n&gt; really want things and make toys look better than in real life, and<br/>\n&gt; even discussions about different religions and good and evil.

She is just getting into some of <br/>\nthese old favorites. <br/>\n<br/>\nI put off Potter though, not forbidden, just not suggested yet either. <br/>\nShe bought a copy now because I took her to the movie. I guess I <br/>\nthought parts of it were not great for some young kids. I think most <br/>\nkids are fine with the evil and violence, but my 4 & 6y kids are still <br/>\nvery real based. I mean that they worry that it&#39;s real somehow. I took <br/>\nthem because the movie looked like it would convey some of the magic in <br/>\nthe story. Maybe the basics of the story have been told by others many <br/>\ntimes before, but the details are what bring it to life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does this have to do with unschooling? Well I guess it&#39;s about <br/>\nreading for fun, writing your own adventure stories, doing the math to <br/>\nsave up for a toy, discussing the psychology of how ads make people <br/>\nreally want things and make toys look better than in real life, and <br/>\neven discussions about different religions and good and evil. Just life <br/>\nstuff. Like all unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy B.<br/>\n(whew, finally a post without the word &quot;addiction&quot; in it.(whoops))</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27925,"nextTopicId":28210}}
