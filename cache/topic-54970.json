And I am<br/>\n&gt; not talking from a societal view, but a health view.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It has been fascinating to me to watch my two daughters grow up.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrit is built like me and is growing up like I did -- tall, thin. I didn&#39;t<br/>\ngain any weight no matter what I ate until I was in my 20s. Now I&#39;m a hefty<br/>\nAmazon-woman &lt;g&gt; but I swear I was a stick until 24 or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nMikey is built like Wally&#39;s sisters -- they&#39;re short and she&#39;s tall, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think she&#39;ll be as tall as Brit, and she&#39;s just rounder all over.<br/>\nShe&#39;ll have actual curves as a teenager, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither one is fat. Brit was a huge baby and toddler -- born at 11.5 pounds,<br/>\noff the charts for height and weight forever. Now, at 8, she&#39;s tall and thin<br/>\n-- a perfect child&#39;s size 10. She looks like a kid model in jeans. Mikey was<br/>\na big baby and toddler, but nothing to compare with Brit, but looks<br/>\ndefinitely &quot;fatter&quot; compared to her sister.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey both run around inside and out like wild lunatic heathens at least<br/>\nseveral times per day. &lt;g&gt; I don&#39;t ask them to exercise, and since we&#39;re in<br/>\na townhouse and share a wall with a very kind elderly neighbor, I even ask<br/>\nthem NOT to race around after 10 p.m. ;) They seem to have worked out their<br/>\nown exercise needs. I&#39;m sure it helps that we live in California where the<br/>\nweather is good enough to be outside even on most winter days.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55243,"nextTopicId":55297}}
