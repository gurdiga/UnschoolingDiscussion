I know how you are feeling right <br/>\nnow, I felt the same way when I first discovered how much I allowed my mother <br/>\nto &quot;control&quot; my life a few years ago.  She is also a &quot;control freak&quot; and <br/>\nloves to tell everyone what, where, when, and how to do something. <br/>\n     You are right when you say that it won&#39;t be easy.  I have been trying to <br/>\nput up boundaries for 3 years now.  My mother is just refusing to give up the <br/>\ncontrols.  Every time I get two steps ahead, she pulls me one step back.  She <br/>\nalso lays guilt trips on me, as far as my leaving her control.  She <br/>\nalternates between yelling at me, to crying and saying that my pulling away <br/>\nhurts her feelings.  The tension between us is very tough to handle.  There <br/>\nwould have been many times that I would have given in to her tears (never her <br/>\nanger, but her tears always get to me) and allowed her to control me once <br/>\nagain if she would just stop crying.<br/>\n     If it wasn&#39;t for my husband, I would be back at step one.  My husband is <br/>\nvery laid back, and he just doesn&#39;t ever seem to let anyone get on his <br/>\nnerves, so when he tells me that what my parents are doing is wrong, then I <br/>\nknow I can believe him.  He cannot believe, how hard they are clinging on for <br/>\ncontrol of us, when we are trying to make our own decisions.  They just won&#39;t <br/>\naccept it!  Every confrontation brings either anger or tears from them, then <br/>\nthey pull away for a few weeks, then they slowly start right back to trying <br/>\nto control us!<br/>\n     I don&#39;t know your own parents, of course, so it may not be so hard for <br/>\nyou.  I hope it is not, as it can be emotionally draining.  I feel for you, <br/>\nand I wish you the best of luck.

See, my parents(mother & stepfather), are<br/>\nvery close with my children, as well as a big influence, and have been<br/>\nsince they were born(ages 6 & 8).  I told my Mom I had some articles<br/>\nabout Unschooling I thought she might be interested in reading, and she<br/>\nsaid &quot;I just don&#39;t see why anyone would even want to consider<br/>\nunschooling&quot;.  I spoken to her about it before, and given her reading<br/>\nmaterials on child led learning early on in my decision to do<br/>\nhomeschooling(a year and a half ago).  She had no comment then either,<br/>\ncome to think of it.  But, I think she read the articles and then gave<br/>\nthem back to me(again, no comment).  THis is disapproval for her, she is<br/>\nonly holding her tongue.<br/>\n\tI don&#39;t need her approval.  If I did, I never could&#39;ve made it this<br/>\nfar.  It&#39;s just that after joining this list, I am realizing some things<br/>\nI don&#39;t really like.<br/>\n\tI consider my Mom to be a &quot;control freak&quot; by nature, and she especially<br/>\nlikes to meddle in my life and my kids&#39;.  I can&#39;t stand this about it,<br/>\nbut also I can&#39;t change it, unfortunately.  She is big on education. <br/>\nShe in financial aide director at a state university.  SHe is very<br/>\nopinionated.  My stepdad is much, much better.  He is a retired<br/>\nProfessor of English.   Still, eduction is the primary focus in my<br/>\nextended family.  My own father is a retired school teacher(music), and<br/>\nhe is the worst of all, I think.  <br/>\n\tBut, right now my Mom is driving me crazy!  She is constantly<br/>\n&quot;quizzing&quot; the kids, as you were talking about on here.  She is<br/>\nconstantly buying books, from readers, to workbooks, to chapter books<br/>\nand such.  Everytime we visit, she makes little comments about whether<br/>\nor not my son reads enough.<br/>\nHe reads as much as he wants to, no more, more less, and somedays this<br/>\nis a lot, and some it is none at all.  I just say &quot;he reads all the<br/>\ntime, don&#39;t worry about it&quot; and she acts surprised.  Why?  Because when<br/>\nshe is around him, she is always trying to get him to read to her and do<br/>\nschool type stuff/learning.  I can&#39;t believe I am only just now<br/>\nrealizing all of this.  I knew she was REALLY gettting on my nerves, but<br/>\njust couldn&#39;t put my finger on it to this extent.  O.K., well, it seems<br/>\nto me the more she tries to manipulate him into reading, the less<br/>\ninterested he becomes, hmmmmmmmm....<br/>\n\tIt really makes me mad that she is trying to control my children&#39;s<br/>\neducation this way.

I copied it so I can read it again & again, for myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am continuously surprised(learning to expect it) at people&#39;s<br/>\nresponse(I mean everyone!) to when I tell them I am Homeschooling my<br/>\nkids(I don&#39;t even bother trying to explain unschooling).  Immediately<br/>\nthey usually respond by commenting on how hard it much be to do that,<br/>\nand try to say something positive like, &quot;you have more patience than I<br/>\ndo&quot; or something or other, then ask a question pertaining to curriculum<br/>\nand ALWAYS, comment or ask a negative question about &quot;what about<br/>\nsocialization&quot;.  I keep wondering why everyone says almost exactly the<br/>\nsame thing, even people whom I would&#39;ve thought to be more openminded;<br/>\nare they all programmed by the same people?  hahaha!<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":599,"nextTopicId":609}}
