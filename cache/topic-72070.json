Do you<br/>\nplay<br/>\nwith them sometimes, getting down on the floor and all?  Do they play<br/>\noutside now that the weather is getting nicer?  Do they have friends who<br/>\njoin in their play sometimes and bring fresh ideas?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids do a lot of play inside with their toys. I&#39;m also very fortunate<br/>\nthat they have each other and get along as they do. Plus we get together<br/>\nwith other kids once a week. When it&#39;s not summer, it&#39;s twice a week<br/>\ngenerally. Some times more often than that but not usually less unless<br/>\nsomeone is sick. They also have the backyard with swing set, sandbox and<br/>\npool. We take walks arounf the neighborhood or just go to the park<br/>\nourselves. My kids always find someone else to play with. I&#39;m also lucky<br/>\nthat pretty much all year round my kids can out and play if they want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Do you have art supplies around, available to them&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not realy crafty at all. But I keep one whole cupboard full of creative<br/>\nthings for the kids. They can get to it themselves. We have a felt board<br/>\nwith all kinds of felt objects I made for them. Playdough, paper, markers,<br/>\npencils, crayons, paints, yarn, pipecleaners, glues, scissors, fake eyes,<br/>\npom poms, stencils and I&#39;m sure more. Being that it&#39;s right there for them<br/>\nto use, they often do all sorts of things without me suggesting anything. If<br/>\nI come across something on the net, or like at holiday times I&#39;ll go<br/>\nsearching for cute little things to make, I&#39;ll ask and see if the want to do<br/>\nit. I must admit that last Christmas I had a wonderful time with the kids<br/>\nwatching them make snowdomes and ornaments of all kinds. I even joined in<br/>\nand made some of my own.
