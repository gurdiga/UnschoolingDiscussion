How does a person heal the wounds of religious<br/>\n&gt; abuse? Hopefully, within a caring and understanding new social setting. This<br/>\n&gt; can be a family, a support or therapy group, or an organized community such as<br/>\n&gt; a mainstream church, religious group, or humanist society. It should also be<br/>\n&gt; done with patience and the consideration that recovery will take time and<br/>\n&gt; effort. The following are some ideas for persons who have walked away from<br/>\n&gt; religious abuse and who are on the road to reclaiming their lives.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *    Work towards trusting yourself and relying on your own abilities.<br/>\n&gt; *    Put your experience down in writing. This will help you to evaluate,<br/>\n&gt; understand, and cope with your past involvement in the abusive group.<br/>\n&gt; *    Get in touch with other people who have gone through similar experiences,<br/>\n&gt; either one-on-one or in a support group.<br/>\n&gt; *    Find a hobby or pastime to reinforce a positive sense of accomplishment.<br/>\n&gt; *    When floating occurs, firmly remind yourself that the episode was<br/>\n </span></blockquote>triggered <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; by some stimulus. Remember also that it will pass. Identify the trigger, learn<br/>\n&gt; to make a new association, and repeat the new association until it overrides<br/>\n&gt; the old one. Talking it over with someone who undersands can really help, too.<br/>\n&gt; *    Handle decisions, tasks, and relearning of interpersonal skills one setp<br/>\n </span></blockquote>at <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a time. Don&#39;t rush yourself, talk and think things over, and don&#39;t be afraid<br/>\n&gt; if you make mistakes  we all do!<br/>\n&gt; *    Be more willing to help people as you go along. This builds up<br/>\n </span></blockquote>self-esteems <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and exercises your problem-solving skills.<br/>\n&gt; *    Take a breather from organized religion for about three to nine months,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>at <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; least.
