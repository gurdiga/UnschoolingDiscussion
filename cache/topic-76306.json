Their drive to keep us all together in one place is amazing -- as soon as one person starts to &quot;stray&quot; from the &quot;flock&quot;, the dog is out and around them and trying to persuade them to turn back where it&#39;s &quot;safe&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a stressful situation (like the fireworks) I can certainly see where a dog that is hard-wired for herding (as the vast majority of ACDs are) would try to keep you all in as tight a bunch as possible, so that might explain the behavior.  I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s motivated out of a protective instinct or out of nervousness (and hence desire to control the situation) -- I&#39;m guessing the latter would usually be the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a serious lapse of judgement, we had our sheep up grazing the front yard on the night of the 4th.  (That&#39;s usually where we have them at night, it didn&#39;t occur to us to do any differently until it was too late.)  Two sets of neighbors started setting off bottle rockets and roman candles and a variety of other noisy, exploding fireworks.  The sheep actually did a good job of ignoring most of it (picture that scene from Babe where the sheep are watching the Christmas fireworks, LOL).  The problems happened when we sent our Border Collie, Summer, out to gather them to put them in the barn for the night.   We chose Summer because he is our oldest, best-trained, most reliable dog.  But even he couldn&#39;t work competently under the stress of the fireworks display (and this is not a dog that is particularly sensitive to sounds or anything else).  His lack of confidence in the situation was easily translated by the sheep, and we had a real mess on our hands -- sheep bolting here and there, and Summer running frantically about trying to control everything, but with such urgency that he was just making things worse.  I finally called him to me and put him on leash -- once he figured I had control of the situation, he settled down, and together we drove the sheep to the barn. <br/>\n<br/>\nMakes me marvel at military dogs -- keeping their cool under fire is an incredible feat!<br/>\n<br/>\n--Shelley, Mommy to Jacob (2 1/2 yrs) and Gabriel (4 mos)<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Harvest Moon -- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:harvest.moon@...\">harvest.moon@...</a><br/>\n  Working Rough and Smooth Collies<br/>\n  www.geocities.com/harvestmooncollies<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"dogs herding us?","postDate":"1057594848","msgId":76306,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3Ni4xY2U0NDE4Yi4yYzNhZjdlMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":76310,"prevInTime":76305,"nextInTime":76307,"topicId":76306,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kelly, Shelley, any other dog-wise people here, Our dog Gudrun, a five year old or so Australian cattle dog, has been outside with us in the presence of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-580569796\">Kelly, Shelley, any other dog-wise people here, <br/>\n<br/>\nOur dog Gudrun, a five year old or so Australian cattle dog, has been outside <br/>\nwith us in the presence of fireworks since she was a little lap puppy and we <br/>\ntook turns holding her so she wouldn&#39;t be scared her first year.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other night it was just me, Marty and Holly out in the cul-de-sac with a <br/>\nfew fireworks.
