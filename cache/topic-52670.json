Getting lost IS the consequence. Feeling scared IS the <br/>\nconsequence. and what caused it? Me. I became distracted or busy or I didn&#39;t <br/>\npay enough attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, sometimes getting lost teaches children not to do it again and feeling <br/>\nscared does too, but there are many instances I&#39;ve seen where the child took <br/>\noff and was where they wanted to be and wasn&#39;t scared or in their opinion <br/>\nlost.  They were where they wanted to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that 3 and 4 are young, but we often don&#39;t realize that kids can <br/>\nunderstand and learn more than what we think.  I realize in my post that I <br/>\ncame across as someone who uses a &quot;negative&quot; approach most of the time.  <br/>\nActually, I use distraction, a lot of praise and attention, food and snacks <br/>\nfor long shopping times, and I always thank them for helping me, for <br/>\nlistening to me, and for behaving in a public place.  It&#39;s been a long time <br/>\nsince I had any problems with my children at a public place.  I can take them <br/>\nto nice restaurants, departments stores, libraries and other places without <br/>\nworrying or dealing with misbehavior.  We all have a wonderful time.  They <br/>\nunderstand there are times and places where they can do certain things, and <br/>\ntime and places where they are expected to behave in a certain manner.  I <br/>\nteach them that it&#39;s important for them to tell me about what they want to <br/>\ndo, how they&#39;re feeling, and if they need something, instead of throwing a <br/>\ntemper tantrum or running off.  My children are also 3 and 4.  We were <br/>\nrecently in a Meijer department store and my daughter took a few steps away <br/>\nfrom me to go and look at a few Dora toys.  She stopped and turned around and <br/>\nasked me if she could look at them.  I told her sure we can do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the consequence for having to leave a public place because my children <br/>\nwon&#39;t stay with me is because once they won&#39;t listen and I can&#39;t insure their <br/>\nsafety, I feel we&#39;d better leave.  It&#39;s true I could strap them in a cart, <br/>\nbut my kids don&#39;t like being in carts, especially for long outings.  In this <br/>\nsituation, I feel we misewell just leave.  I want my children to explore and <br/>\nhave fun in public places instead of having to be strapped in.  That&#39;s why I <br/>\ntaught them at an early age to stay with me at all times.  Children&#39;s <br/>\nmaturity may play an important part in that, or their behavior.  Some <br/>\nchildren are very spontaneous, active, and/or have a hard time listening to <br/>\nauthority.  These children may need to be kept at home if mommy or daddy <br/>\ncan&#39;t watch them carefully.     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Not because I am a ditzbrain or don&#39;t care or am lazy, but because I came <br/>\n </span></blockquote>into the store to do something specific. So my little one stays in the cart <br/>\nor with someone who CAN watch him. I don&#39;t think that a child getting away in <br/>\nthe store is doing something &quot;wrong&quot;, he is exploring and learning! Seeing <br/>\nwhat is cool and interesting in his world.. So it&#39;s important to let him have <br/>\nthat freedom, when I am free to pay attention. <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that often times its the parents who are at fault for their chidren&#39;s <br/>\nbehavior.  One thing I&#39;ve noticed, at least with my children and with others, <br/>\nis once they taste the sweet flavor of freedom, they don&#39;t want to be in the <br/>\ncart even for a few minutes.  It&#39;s true that for their safety, they can stay <br/>\nin the cart, no matter what temper tantrum and whining and crying they do, <br/>\nbut it doesn&#39;t make a very pleasant time for anyone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI happen to disagree that a child taking off has not done something wrong, <br/>\ndepending on the child and what the child has been taught.  Children at that <br/>\nage can learn and understand why it&#39;s important to stay with mommy or daddy.  <br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that parents can be oblivious to what their children are doing <br/>\nwhile they&#39;re in a public place and expect children to always remember and <br/>\nfollow their instructions.  I remind them, have them help me choose things, <br/>\ntalk with them, aks them questions, etc.  There is no parent who wants to <br/>\nexperience the horror and feeling when their child is out of sight at a <br/>\npublic place, but most parents have at least once.  I know when I had that <br/>\nscary feeling happen to me I decided it would never happen again.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething I am working hard on is remembering to act on what I believe so <br/>\nstrongly. That Kids Come First. They need to do what they desire just as much <br/>\nas I do. I can be &quot;in charge&quot; and tell them what they can and can&#39;t do, OR I <br/>\ncan work their needs in so that they get to do, see, touch, move as much as <br/>\nI.<br/>\nThat&#39;s one of the few reasons that the superstores are good, I can throw BOTH <br/>\ntowels in the bigass cart and debate the colors while standing in the toy <br/>\nsection!<br/>\n<br/>\nI strongly agree that kids come first, but what does that mean and at what <br/>\nexpense.  I know there&#39;s a method out there that teaches parents to let their <br/>\nkids explore, never use any negative connotations, and let them be creative <br/>\nand explore all they want.  I&#39;ve seen kids who have been raised this way to <br/>\nan extreme and I don&#39;t want my kids to grow up like that.  They have no <br/>\nrespect for others feelings and belongings.  They do what they want, no <br/>\nmatter who it might bother, upset, or hurt.  The children I&#39;m talking about <br/>\nhad parents who went to the extreme.  I&#39;m not saying you are this way.  No <br/>\none would ever want to be around these kids, and they could not find any <br/>\nbabysitters.  They could not go anywhere with them without embarassment, <br/>\ntantrums and a lot of hassles.  I love children and I realize that their <br/>\nbehavior is not their fault, but I can&#39;t stand to be around these children.  <br/>\nThey break toys with no remorse, throw things to see how neat a golf ball can <br/>\nbounce on the wall and hit a kid in the head, color on walls and toys, and <br/>\nignore and have no respect for anyone&#39;s feelings or adult authority.  They do <br/>\nall these things because the parents taught them that they are more important <br/>\nthan anyone else and if they want to be creative by taking apart a friend&#39;s <br/>\ntoy, or running and jumping up and down a restaurant aisle, that it&#39;s okay <br/>\nbecause parents shouldn&#39;t tell their children what to do and how to behave.  <br/>\nAs a parent, I feel we need to use a combination of different methods to help <br/>\nour children explore, learn, and understand the world we live in.  We don&#39;t <br/>\nlive in a world where we can do whatever we want at all times.  My children <br/>\nare happy and wonderful to be around.  I don&#39;t think I stifle their <br/>\ncuriosities, their need for exploration, and their desire to learn about the <br/>\nworld around them.  They have many opportunities to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatti<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":123374705,"authorName":"ejcrewe@aol.com","from":"ejcrewe@...","profile":"ejcrewe2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Three year old running away in crowds","postDate":"1040585134","msgId":52728,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NS4xOTQzNThjZi4yYjM3NmJhZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52725,"nextInTopic":52729,"prevInTime":52727,"nextInTime":52729,"topicId":52670,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/22/2002 8:36:07 AM Central Standard Time, ...

Getting lost IS the consequence. Feeling scared IS the <br/>\nconsequence. and what caused it? Me. I became distracted or busy or I didn&#39;t <br/>\npay enough attention.<br/>\nNot because I am a ditzbrain or don&#39;t care or am lazy, but because I came <br/>\ninto the store to do something specific. So my little one stays in the cart <br/>\nor with someone who CAN watch him. I don&#39;t think that a child getting away in <br/>\nthe store is doing something &quot;wrong&quot;, he is exploring and learning! Seeing <br/>\nwhat is cool and interesting in his world.. So it&#39;s important to let him have <br/>\nthat freedom, when I am free to pay attention.

He<br/>\n| couldn&#39;t find a double stroller cart at Kohls and our daughter<br/>\nran away from<br/>\n| him.  Both kids do this from time to time, my son is four and<br/>\nmy daughter is<br/>\n| three.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| This time it was a huge store and Mark really couldn&#39;t find<br/>\nher.  He asked a<br/>\n| clerk, couldn&#39;t describe Julia, was worried that Nathan was<br/>\nabout to bolt too<br/>\n| and was just in a fog looking for her and panicking.

Ten<br/>\n| minutes later (for some reason he looked at his watch), another<br/>\nfemale clerk<br/>\n| came up holding Julia&#39;s hand.  &quot;Is this your daughter?&quot;  Why<br/>\ndidn&#39;t she ask<br/>\n| Julia if Mark was her father???<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Ok, so my issue isn&#39;t with the store, but with the child.  Both<br/>\nkids<br/>\n| actually.  One of my biggest fears in taking them to huge<br/>\npublic places alone<br/>\n| is that I wont be able to keep track of them.  They are too<br/>\nyoung, at least<br/>\n| Julia is, to understand the danger.  And I don&#39;t want to scare<br/>\nthem too much.<br/>\n|  But whatever we have said in the past hasn&#39;t worked.  They<br/>\nunderstand that<br/>\n| it scares us, that we might not be able to find them, that<br/>\nsomething bad<br/>\n| could happen.  Or at least, we have told them that.  I&#39;m not at<br/>\nall sure they<br/>\n| understand.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Help, help, help.  I love to give them the freedom to walk in<br/>\nstores instead<br/>\n| of being secured to a stroller or cart.  They are pretty<br/>\nrespectful of stuff<br/>\n| and have never broken anything.  But should I strap them in?<br/>\nRemember, I&#39;m<br/>\n| walking slowly and mostly with one crutch.

My","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-275230586\">When my daughter was just a little one herself, Adam Walsh was abducted and <br/>\nkilled. It happened in the same shopping plaza we shopped in and still do <br/>\nnow. My daughter at that time would love to hide in the clothing racks and <br/>\nnot answer when called. After that happened to the little Walsh boy, I <br/>\nexplained to her not in great detail what happened. I told her some people <br/>\nwill take little children and hurt them. It was very important that she not <br/>\nleave my sight. If she couldn&#39;t see me, than I couldn&#39;t see her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve done that with all 3 younger ones. I make them understand from early on <br/>\nhow dangerous it could be for them to be away from me in a store. They also <br/>\nunderstand procedures if they are at sports camp and someone asks them to go <br/>\nwith them, whether it&#39;s someone they know or not. We&#39;ve gone over what to do <br/>\nin case someone does try to take them and even what to do if they find <br/>\nthemselves in a car with a stranger. I felt bad about having to deal with <br/>\nsuch things and little children, but I&#39;ve seen too much sorrow with kids <br/>\nbeing taking in just a matter of a minute. I take the precaution. If I have <br/>\nto go out shopping with all 3, I take another pair of eyes. And my kids are <br/>\n2, 7 and 8. Even at that age, I need to keep track of them. If I can&#39;t have <br/>\nsomeone with me, I put the youngest in a stroller or buggy. I may let her <br/>\nout in the toy aisle and make sure all 3 stay with me. Rather have them <br/>\nupset with me about that then go through losing them. Of course now my kids <br/>\nknow enough to be careful. Even the 2 year old understands. But when I need <br/>\nto shop as in look for something, she&#39;s in the buggy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I&#39;ve scared them silly. I use to worry about my oldest and <br/>\nsuch things but she has grown up understanding even now, at 17 how important <br/>\nit is to be aware. She uses her head now as she has learned form early on. <br/>\nNot just children get abducted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI say do what it takes to make sure the kids stay safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 3 months FREE*. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail&xAPID=42&PS=47575&PI=7324&DI=7474&SU=\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail&xAPID=42&PS=47575&PI=7324&DI=7474&SU=</a> <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/getmsg&HL=1216hotmailtaglines_advancedjmf_3mf\">http://www.hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/getmsg&HL=1216hotmailtaglines_advancedjmf_3mf</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":123374705,"authorName":"ejcrewe@aol.com","from":"ejcrewe@...","profile":"ejcrewe2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Three year old running away in crowds","postDate":"1040518600","msgId":52680,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhLjMxODA5OTRjLjJiMzY2N2M4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":52674,"nextInTopic":52686,"prevInTime":52679,"nextInTime":52681,"topicId":52670,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/21/2002 6:13:44 PM Central Standard Time, ...

He <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t find a double stroller cart at Kohls and our daughter ran away from <br/>\nhim.  Both kids do this from time to time, my son is four and my daughter is <br/>\nthree.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time it was a huge store and Mark really couldn&#39;t find her.  He asked a <br/>\nclerk, couldn&#39;t describe Julia, was worried that Nathan was about to bolt too <br/>\nand was just in a fog looking for her and panicking.  He vaguely remembers an <br/>\nannouncement over the PA but has no idea of they secured the exits.  Ten <br/>\nminutes later (for some reason he looked at his watch), another female clerk <br/>\ncame up holding Julia&#39;s hand.  &quot;Is this your daughter?&quot;  Why didn&#39;t she ask <br/>\nJulia if Mark was her father???<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so my issue isn&#39;t with the store, but with the child.  Both kids <br/>\nactually.  One of my biggest fears in taking them to huge public places alone <br/>\nis that I wont be able to keep track of them.  They are too young, at least <br/>\nJulia is, to understand the danger.  And I don&#39;t want to scare them too much. <br/>\n But whatever we have said in the past hasn&#39;t worked.  They understand that <br/>\nit scares us, that we might not be able to find them, that something bad <br/>\ncould happen.  Or at least, we have told them that.
