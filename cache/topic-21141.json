I am sympathetic to those who &quot;I&quot; feel truly need assistance. It<br/>\namazes me how many adults( I use this term loosely, since alot are teenaged<br/>\nmothers and fathers) on assistance use their allotments to get cash and then<br/>\nspend it on alcohol and cigarettes.  I know I am probably bias in this area.<br/>\nI was a single mom and no one assisted me.  It was my decision to  raise my<br/>\nchild and I intended to do so.  I do sympathize with those parents with<br/>\nchildren with special needs, special diets and high cost foods.  What amazes<br/>\nme the most is the amount of grandparents that have to raise their<br/>\ngrandchildren because their child wasn&#39;t responsible enough to do so.<br/>\nI find the homeschool story a little unsettling.

I like to think that<br/>\nI would, but who can ever say what the details of life will bring to us? <br/>\n I am just bothered by the idea that this mother should have been<br/>\nworking, rather than being with her kids, because she had once had a high<br/>\npaying job.<br/>\nAnd, I think the father should be ashamed of himself that his children<br/>\nended up homeless.  Maybe he should have been working two jobs and<br/>\nsending the extra money to his kids!  Why should any children end up<br/>\nhomeless?  The circumstances were certainly not their fault.<br/>\nI am reading &quot;The Price of Motherhood&quot; , by Ann Crittenden.  While I<br/>\ndon&#39;t agree with everything she says, she makes some excellent points<br/>\nabout the fact that our society does not value motherhood as a career. <br/>\nWe (as a society - I am not referring to any specific individual) tend to<br/>\nview it more as volunteer work that women do by choice.
