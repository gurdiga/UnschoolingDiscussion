I<br/>\nhave to make the best decisions I can for things like their safety (and that<br/>\nsometimes means real &quot;No&#39;s&quot; - &quot;No, you can&#39;t run into the street&quot;), for<br/>\ntheir health (&quot;Yes, you may eat cookies after dinner&quot;) and for their<br/>\nwell-being. Sometimes that makes them unhappy, and that is en emotion they<br/>\nneed to be able to recognize and deal with effectively. So if the kids are<br/>\nnot happy to wait, I just empathize with them &quot;It&#39;s frustrating to have to<br/>\nwait for something you really want now&quot;. I have these frustrations in my own<br/>\nlife too, and when I don&#39;t acknowledge them, they build to an unhealthy<br/>\npoint.<br/>\nMy mantra is &quot;I&#39;m not responsible for my child&#39;s emotions, I am only<br/>\nresponsible for my reaction to them.&quot; I try really hard to avoid falling<br/>\ninto my mom&#39;s pitfall, which is that she always wants to &quot;fix&quot; any &quot;bad&quot;<br/>\nemotions. She changes the subject or ignores the negative emotion or tries<br/>\nto bribe someone out of it. It took me a very long time as an adult to even<br/>\nrecognize my emotions and be able to acknowledge them as valid.<br/>\nSo IMHO, along with changing the way we present things, reflection and<br/>\nvalidation of whatever emotions arise are also useful tools.<br/>\n<br/>\n Blue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;I&#39;m going to puff a bunch of hot air into the<br/>\natmosphere and then it will be spring!&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) the aspiring gymnast<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16905,"nextTopicId":16875}}
