But, wasn&#39;t it GREAT!!  What a turnout, <br/>\nconsidering how frigid it was.  It seems that we were toward the beginning <br/>\nof the march as it left the Mall.  Do you know where you were, Shyrley?  I <br/>\nwas marching under a large pink homemade banner that said something like <br/>\n&quot;Warwick Peace Action Group&quot; and &quot;No Blood For Oil&quot;  and &quot;Not in Our <br/>\nName.&quot;  It could&#39;ve been about 10 or 15 degrees warmer and then that would <br/>\nhave been great.  The cops were a little scary at one point though, <br/>\nright?  Did you see when the parade went under the highway how the police <br/>\nwere lined up maybe every six feet or so on either side holding their <br/>\nnight-sticks?<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t wait to see your pictures.  I snapped a few too, but I have no idea <br/>\nhow they&#39;ll come out.  I just held the camera up as high over my head as I <br/>\ncould and snapped away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t get home until about 1 in the morning, and it was 2 below zero <br/>\nwhen we got back to my car.
