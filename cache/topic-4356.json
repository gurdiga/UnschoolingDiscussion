I can&#39;t stand clutter.  Maybe that is<br/>\nwhy I was able to find my own way to unschooling naturally as a teenager,<br/>\ndespite so much opposition and conditioning.  (Of course I did not know I<br/>\nwas Unschooling, I just thought I was being a bad kid and a failure, as<br/>\nusual.)  I used to periodically &quot;clean out&quot; my bedroom when I was still<br/>\nliving with my parents, and since I was not allowed to throw things out I<br/>\nwould make a pile of &quot;useless&quot; and redundant items in the hallway for my<br/>\nmother to throw out or keep as she wanted.  Once, I even put my closet door<br/>\nin the hallway pile, as it was getting in my way, and then I saved space in<br/>\nmy bedroom by putting my turntable and records in the closet and running<br/>\nthe speaker wire out into the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also was in the habit of giving things away to friends who made comments<br/>\nadmiring them.  Everything from bric-a-brac, to my clothes, to a pillow off<br/>\nmy bed once!  They were all items I did not need, and they did not have an<br/>\nemotional signifigance for me.  I also still will give gifts (Birthday,<br/>\nholidays) to people from my own pool of redundant miscelaneous.  However,<br/>\nthese days I do not have nearly as much miscelaneous items to give away.<br/>\nMy parents, particularly my mother, showed their affection by giving me<br/>\ngifts.  Some of the things I could not get rid of fast enough, as they<br/>\nrepresented times when even they, in their closed little short sighted<br/>\nworld, could see that they should have been there for me or had pushed me<br/>\ninto performing something that was extremely damaging for me.  So they<br/>\nwould give me a gift, and call it good.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bonknit@xxx.xxx","from":"Bonknit@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"_CQUQdV16vzi2j8aZPtyoZa8nyvPTIbWMZQWl8BSUcuDaZRl0VurI5evvNcRw9xA0TXhWzL8","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: Growing without Education","postDate":"942195668","msgId":4403,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yOTAuNDQwMy45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4402,"nextInTopic":4410,"prevInTime":4402,"nextInTime":4404,"topicId":4356,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/9/99 6:11:42 PM Eastern Standard Time, LisaBugg@unschooling.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-212977102\">In a message dated 11/9/99 6:11:42 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LisaBugg@...\">LisaBugg@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; We&#39;re working hard at shedding and simplifying.
