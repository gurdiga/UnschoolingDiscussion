I really liked my dad&#39;s pretty antique pistol,<br/>\nand told him not to get rid of it. I just wish that<br/>\nSOMEONE (parents mostly) would do something (like<br/>\nworking on that whole repressed anger thing)that would<br/>\nkeep guns out of hands of people who want them as an<br/>\noutlet for thier anger. Does that make sense? I can&#39;t<br/>\nreally say that i believe a certain law or one certain<br/>\nthing would do the trick, cuz it is too complicated<br/>\nfor that. Just like I don&#39;t think the whole abortion<br/>\nissue is as simple as saying &quot;pro-life&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;pro-choice&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is sooo sad about your sister. It nearly made me<br/>\ncry. I am always so worried about things like that. <br/>\nWhen i was little, my little sister (I think she was 3<br/>\nor so) and me were jumping on our bed and she got it<br/>\nin her head to jump OFF the windowsill and onto the<br/>\nbed where she would sommersault. Well, she tumbled<br/>\nright off he bed and hit the corner of her forehead<br/>\n*SMACK* against the side of the door. She got a HUGE<br/>\npurple egg sized bruise/bump and the next morning her<br/>\neyes were swollen shut. It was sooo awful looking. The<br/>\ndoctor said she was fine, it just looked much worse<br/>\nthan it was, and so we still played with our next door<br/>\nneighbors and told them the whole story. But they<br/>\nstill felt the need to call social services on my mom,<br/>\neven though we were almost never even spanked or<br/>\nhardly ever even got in trouble. An officer came and<br/>\nwe were outside playing and I went up to him (who<br/>\nknows why) and he asked me all these questions about<br/>\ngetting spankings and where we got them and if she hit<br/>\nus in the face, etc. Then talked to my mom and she<br/>\nexplained and he left. whew.<br/>\nThen there are kids that truly are neglected and<br/>\nunwanted that nothing is ever done about to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that things work out so that your sister can<br/>\nhave her son back.<br/>\n-Bobbie <br/>\n<br/>\n--- Nicoletta Manns &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snmanns@...\">snmanns@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I personally don&#39;t believe that gun laws are going<br/>\n&gt; to make much of a<br/>\n&gt; difference, because guns are not really the problem:<br/>\n&gt; people/kids with<br/>\n&gt; repressed rage are the problem that needs to be<br/>\n&gt; addressed.
