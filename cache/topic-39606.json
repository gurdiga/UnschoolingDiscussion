For example, if she thinks that huamn biology will be inportant, have her decide WHAT about human biology would be important and what she would like to do about it (research it, attend an autopsy, have a baby -- okay, I&#39;m being really far out here, and very tongue in cheek, but the point I am trying to make is : why does she think a specific area is important?  You mentioned Math -- is she thinking it will be important to a future career, or just an entrance subject to University?  Or does she really love it?  Whatever the answer is will dictate a very different approach.  If she is wanting it for a career, have her talk to somebody in that career and see what exactly they use and why -- was it mainly learned &quot;on the job&quot; or is there a specific theorem that is really useful?  If it is for university, both of you sit down and talk to a registrar and see what equivalencies would be accepted.  If it is an intrinsic interest, how would she care to pursue it?  As she begins to &quot;deschool&quot;, she will even quit dividing things into discrete subject categories, and start thinking instead about what interests her and why.  For example, a passage I just read tonight in a book talks about a girl sitting outside and copying a picture of a bird&#39;s skeleton.  A boy asks her if she is doing science.  She laughed.  &quot;See how school shutters you,&quot; she said.  &quot;I&#39;m drawing, painting, reading, looking. I&#39;m feeling the sun and the air on my skin.  I&#39;m listening to the balckbird&#39;s song.  I&#39;m opening my mind.  Ha!  School!&quot;         Does your daughter like to read?  There are numerous living books out there on the topic of homeschooling, and unschooling.  I just read one to my kids tonight, called Skellig.  Now, I don&#39;t know where you are at with the supernatural and fantasy, but the boy&#39;s next door neighbor, Mina, is unschooled.  He needs to take time off school to deal with his baby sister&#39;s illness, and hangs out with Mina.  He asks her a lot of the same kinds of questions about how will she learn anything, and she shows him the sculptures she has been making, and shares her research on the archaeopteryx and how birds fly.  Then they look at his homework of fill in the blanks and see the contrast.  It&#39;s a great lesson.  However, there is a supernatural character, who seems to be evolving from a human into a bird.  I can see where many people would be put off by this, but I really like the homeschool scenes.  There is another book called Libby on Wednesday, where the girl is homeschooled, and then tries public school.  Her friends are really impressed by the time lines and other projects she worked on while she was at home.  You know your daughter best and what will motivate her.  Possibly talking to other homeschooled teens will be a reassurance to her.  Anyway, I wish you luck -- and if there is anything more concrete I can do (book recommendations or whatever) let me know!

This year <br/>\nwe moved and dd13 entered highschool (year 7 in land of Oz) She hated <br/>\nit and was miserable.  After a month (school starts in Jan here) I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t stand it anymore.  She has always liked school so this was <br/>\nnew territory.<br/>\nI am a firm believer in learning our own life lessons and I thought <br/>\nshe would learn what she needed to from the experience and things <br/>\nwould improve.  I was wrong.  So I made a soul decision to remove her <br/>\nfrom school realising that it was as much my life lesson as hers.<br/>\nFor the first month we followed a schedule of subjects like school, <br/>\nboth of us not knowing any different.  I got frustrated with that so <br/>\nstarted researching other methods.  We have tried Rudolf Steiner and <br/>\nCharlotte Mason.  Even though these worked better and have something <br/>\nto offer they still weren&#39;t quite what I wanted.  Then I <br/>\ndiscovered &#39;unschooling&#39;.  Something clicked and I knew it was the <br/>\nway to go.  <br/>\nI have tried to explain the concept of natural learning to dd13 but <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t believe that it could be that &#39;simple&#39;.  I&#39;ve told her to <br/>\nforget about subjects and how schools teach, just to do whatever she <br/>\nfeels like doing.<br/>\nAnyway, sorry for rambling on :), she will do this for a week or so <br/>\nand then get into a panic about all the things she is not learning <br/>\nand what she &#39;should&#39; be &#39;studying&#39;.  She is really scared that she <br/>\nwill be behind her peers, that she will not be able to go to <br/>\nUniversity if she doesn&#39;t follow a cirriculum - Maths is the bigger <br/>\n(She hates maths!)<br/>\nI&#39;ve explained till I&#39;m blue in the face and there is still a &#39;but&#39; <br/>\nafter each discussion.  I was hoping :) that some of you could post <br/>\nsome reassurances to her, especially if you have children her age or <br/>\nolder.  Maybe they have some words of wisdom to offer her too?<br/>\nHer name is Coreyna and she is one of the lights of my life.  If she <br/>\nthrived and was happy doing hours of &#39;school&#39; bookwork each day I <br/>\nwould do it with her.  But she hates it.  I don&#39;t like seeing her so <br/>\nscared and anxious about her future.<br/>\nI asked if she would like to read some posts from people who have <br/>\nbreathed &#39;life learning&#39; and she is very interested in doing that.  <br/>\nGuess she doesn&#39;t trust my judgement or her own :(  I think she <br/>\nthinks I will change my mind again on how we will homeschool as we <br/>\nhave tried so many methods.  She doesn&#39;t quite get that this isn&#39;t <br/>\na &#39;method&#39;, just life.<br/>\nSo, pleeeeeeeeeeez help.  Your guidance would be very much <br/>\nappreciated.<br/>\nLove Joz<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  Pulled other 2 out of the &#39;system&#39; recently with dh&#39;s full <br/>\nsupport.  They are both &#39;deschooling&#39; and loving it.  Have had others <br/>\nin the neighbourhood plead with me to homeschool them!  There are no <br/>\nother homeschooled kids in this area.  Some parents think I am insane <br/>\nor just plain stupid - and I&#39;ve never been happier in my life.<br/>\nJoz</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39680,"nextTopicId":39671}}
