I myself am Christian.  Unschooling is a style of learning where the <br/>\nparent lets the child learn in a way that is best for them (very <br/>\noversimplified I know). I know many, many different types of people that <br/>\nunschool that represent many different religions (or have no religion at <br/>\nall).  My  point is that unschooling is not a religious style, it is a <br/>\nlearning style (however, some particular religious groups may be attracted to <br/>\nunschooling).<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\nDena<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/HsMomsSupport\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/HsMomsSupport</a>    <br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6348,"nextTopicId":6357}}
