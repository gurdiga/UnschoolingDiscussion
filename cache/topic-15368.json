Believe me, as an openly pagan family who lives in a VERY Mormon community spiced with fundamental Christians, we get our fair share of preaching and condemnation.  There are many Christians (as there always have been throughout the history of the religion) who do not practice what they claim to believe in tolerance, acceptance, non-judgemental attitudes, brotherhood, love and friendship, no matter how pleasant and unoffending you try to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe feel much as you do.  While our beliefs are strong and deeply spiritual, we do not believe that they take away the sanctity or reality of the beliefs of others.  As someone shared with the wheel of many spokes analogy, Divinity has many faces.  God and Goddess to us are the two main representations of the divine entity, representing the male and female, life and death and rebirth, the elements and seasons, light and dark, all within one source.  God and Goddess in turn have many faces.  Diana, Hecate, Arrionrod, Mary, Holy Mother, Venus, and Gaia are just a few of the names by which Goddess is called upon and revered.  God, Holy Father, Jesus, Cernunos, Pan, Zeus, and Odin are just a few of the names by which the male force of the divine is recognized and worshipped.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo us, each of these faces if valid and important, just as each of us is unique and adds to the richness of the whole of any groups we belong to (cultural, religious, racial, national, Professional, familial, etc.)  We are complex beings, made in the image of our creators, and just as we present different faces of our inner selves, as appropriate, to different beings in our lives, so too our divine force presents different faces to us, as appropriate for us at any given stage in our development and enlightenment.  None is better than any other, as they all have things to teach us and important work for us to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the pagans I have known in my life and travels so far have believed in all the same principals and tenets that underpin Christian theology that I mentioned above, brotherhood and love, acceptance and tolerance, non-judgementalism along with the the often uniquely pagan desire to learn and be enriched by the beliefs of others.  They also extend this to include all life in our existance, not just human life, but plants, animals and the living energies of the planet.  Most ( I cannot say all, as their are always exceptions to everything) pagans feel a deep responsibility and stewardship for the earth and it&#39;s inhabitants, in addition to a link and brotherhood with all human life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot see how any of this should offend or upset Christians just because our prayers and rituals are different and we call divinty by a different name.  But, invariably, it does, over and over.  To the point that openly pagan families lose jobs, friends, business, and even are forced to move in some cases by harrassment from the Christian community.  Sad but True.  Just look in your Library archives for articles about it.  They are there, they happen all the time in today&#39;s judgemental, holier than thou America.  Just as San Francisco is a haven for gay people wh owish to live in a community where they are more free to be themselves without fear, so Salem, Mass (ironically) has turned into the same for modern &quot;witches&quot; and pagans.  There are very good reasons why there is such a LARGE per capita pagan population there, just as gay people in America still have real things to fear that we see in the headlines all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.
