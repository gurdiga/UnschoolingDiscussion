I <br/>\nwould talk to Grandpa about changing his mind and having the kids stay for <br/>\ndinner. Explain that you believe the children deserve the same treatment as <br/>\nthe rest of the family, that you don&#39;t differentiate between adults and <br/>\nchildren. Maybe invite Grandpa over for a meal at your home so he can see <br/>\nyour kids calmly sitting down to dinner and participating in polite <br/>\nconversation. But if he remains firm about no kids at his special dinner then <br/>\nmake sure the room service for the kids is included in the room. I say this <br/>\nbecause I firmly believe that if they can&#39;t enjoy a catered meal (Is enjoy <br/>\nthe right word? Catered hotel meals aren&#39;t always the best! &lt;beg&gt;) with the <br/>\nrest of the family, then they should at least get the *same* food. Good luck! <br/>\n:o)<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38205,"nextTopicId":38209}}
