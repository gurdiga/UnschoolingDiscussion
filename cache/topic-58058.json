The answer to your questions above would lie in the intent <br/>\nand the actions of the unschooling parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, if a relative happened to remark to my son that it was <br/>\nnecessary for him to study arithmetic in order to learn math, and <br/>\nthen my son asked for an arithmetic workbook and I simply went ahead <br/>\nand bought him one, then I would be reacting passively to the <br/>\nsituation and leaving out my own intrinsic involvement as an <br/>\nunschooling parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the above scenario, what would be more likely to happen in my <br/>\nhousehold would be that when the remark about studying arithmetic was <br/>\nmade, I would probably state my own opinion (if I was there at the <br/>\ntime), and my opinion is that no, it&#39;s not necessary. It&#39;s one path <br/>\nto learning math, but there are many different paths. Then, when my <br/>\nson asked for the workbook, we would probably have a dialogue about <br/>\nit. This wouldn&#39;t be forced, or any sort of interrogation, but since <br/>\nwe are used to being in each other&#39;s company and discussing things <br/>\nthat we&#39;re interested in, we&#39;d talk about why he wanted the workbook. <br/>\nIf it seemed like he was just interested in having space to work <br/>\nthrough math problems, or having the problems created for him, or <br/>\nthat he thought it would be fun to take on car trips, or whatever, <br/>\nthen that would be that. However, if he was wanting the workbook out <br/>\nof some anxiety that he needed to have it in order to learn math, <br/>\nthen we&#39;d talk about that, and I&#39;d give him my thoughts on that and <br/>\nmaybe some examples of how he has learned math in the past, or how <br/>\nhis dad or I have learned it in ways other than rote learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn neither case would I deny him the workbook, but he would <br/>\ndefinitely have acquired different viewpoints on the subject to think <br/>\nabout, allowing him to come up with his own opinion and make a <br/>\ndecision about the workbook without it coming from some fear-based <br/>\nnotion of learning passed on by someone who doesn&#39;t understand any <br/>\nother models.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the dialogue and the constant interaction between us and our <br/>\nchildren, and the respecting of their opinions and offering of our <br/>\nown that makes unschooling &quot;work&quot; in our lives.

Or when he plays chess.  He said &quot;How is that Math???&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then took two measuring cups and I talked about one being 1 cup, and the other being a 1/2 cup, something we both know.  I asked him how he would explain that to someone who didn&#39;t speak english without a language they could both understand.  He said he didn&#39;t know, so I said, that is what the language of &quot;arithmetic&quot; is for.  We talked about how math is EVERYWHERE, and always has been,  but that in order to communicate the mathematics that we saw, or to work with mathematical ideas, arithmetic was invented.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI picked up a circular object and asked him what shape it was.  He told me it was circle.  I told him, &quot;but who decided it should be called a &#39;circle&#39;&quot;?  It has always been this shape, but the word &quot;circle&quot; is just the word we use to tell someone else what it is we see.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about his Galileo thermometer.  His has numbers, but the original Galileo thermometer did not.  I asked him if he realized that the original was *still* mathematical, even though it didn&#39;t have numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about the pendulum and the physics of a billiard game, the kinetic energy of the que ball when it hits the 8 ball...and theagain, how that is math without numbers.  Then we talked about how there is actually a mathematical formula to discuss kinetic energy and the Laws of Physics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked him if he thought he would learn fractions if he went to work at the lumber yard.  He said he thought he probably would.  So I asked him &quot;then why do we need to learn it now, on a piece of paper?&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI asked him what *he* wanted to learn and told him that I am here to help him learn whatever he wants to learn in any way I can.  I&#39;m here, I&#39;m ready to help in whatever way he wants...its up to him to decide what and I&#39;ll help him with how if he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked him if he still wanted to do the math problem I gave him.  He said &quot;no&quot;.  We threw it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, February 06, 2003 9:49 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] When to push<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 2/6/03 7:05:08 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:litlrooh@...\">litlrooh@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;   I&quot;ve heard unschoolers say (and this is at unschooling.com message <br/>\n  boards) that if a child *wants* to use a workbook, then its still <br/>\n  unschooling.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Holly had a workbook and she was filling in blanks.<br/>\n  Was she &quot;using&quot; the workbook?<br/>\n<br/>\n  The line is drawn somewhere there, internally, and involves factors like:<br/>\n<br/>\n  what did Holly think about the power of the workbook?

And something he has to learn to deal with in his own way.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  You are right.  And I&#39;m fine with it all when I know he is going to stay home.  I&#39;m just not sure how to deal with the criticism of others.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My husband&#39;s boss (who runs the lumber yard I was referring to where my son has said he&#39;d like to work) routinely quizzes my kids when he sees them.   If my son wants to work there, the first thing that boss will do is quiz him to see what he knows.  I guess that just means my son will have to decide if its worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;It doesn&#39;t sound like you have the trust necessary for unschooling to unfold <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  in the joyful manner that it can. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I do, as long as I&#39;m not forced to worry about someone else&#39;s timeline (like the school&#39;s).  To me, our unschooling life and the schedule of the school are diametrically opposed simply *because* my kids don&#39;t learn things at the rate that the school would assign them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wasn&#39;t sure how to deal with that conflict if he decided to return to school.  But perhaps I should just let *him* deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;And he is still blaming YOU for what he <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  didn&#39;t learn, which tell me a lot.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Not to sound dumb, but what does that tell you?  (I&#39;m honestly curious, I&#39;m thinking maybe I&#39;m missing some wisdom here).<br/>\n<br/>\n   I chalk that up as part of his personality.  He consistantly *does* blame others when things don&#39;t go the way he wants them to.  If its a video game, its the computer&#39;s fault.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;&gt;My son takes full responsibility for what he does /doesn&#39;t know.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  He knows I will help him get to information he wants, but I will NOT push him <br/>\n  to do or learn something that frustrates him.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, I&#39;ve also made this clear to my son by explaining that nobody can make him learn anything, even the school.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;If your son thinks school is the answer, I don&#39;t think he has the trust in <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  himself that he needs.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  He thinks its the answer to being with his friends.
