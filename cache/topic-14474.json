Well, probably not, but here&#39;s what else we&#39;re giving for Christmas:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Homemade jam<br/>\n- Cookies<br/>\n- Shopping bags, decorated<br/>\n- Hand-rolled beeswax candles - you can get sheets of beeswax and kids as<br/>\nyoung as 2 or 3 can roll candles with help. Try contacting a beekeeper or<br/>\nhoney company first to see if you can get the beeswax there, it&#39;s a whole<br/>\nlot cheaper than getting it at crafts or specialty stores and much cheaper<br/>\nthan getting the kits. Our honey company even sells wick by the yard. After<br/>\nyou roll the candles, you can cut out designs from beeswax and stick them to<br/>\nit, or roll them in glitter<br/>\n- I made a CD for each of my parents and my sister of our favorite Christmas<br/>\nmusic from when I was a kid. I downloaded it all from Napster.com and burned<br/>\nit onto a CD. This is great because all of the Christmas albums we loved as<br/>\na kid are on vinyl so of course we don&#39;t listen to them anymore. You&#39;d be<br/>\nsurprised what you can find at Napster!<br/>\n- A home-made ornament - this year we&#39;re doing wool angels. You take clean,<br/>\ncarded sheep&#39;s wool and tie some ribbon around it to make the head and body,<br/>\nfluff out some wings and you have a lovely angel. Last year our ornament was<br/>\nwreaths made from canning jar rings. Decorate with beads, felt,  and such to<br/>\nmake a wreath. You can put a picture in the middle too, just glue it to the<br/>\nflat center part of the canning jar lid and glue it in<br/>\n- Some home-grown mint tea. My son and I picked and dried all the mint and<br/>\nlemonbalm and we&#39;re gift-packing it up. We&#39;re also trying to make some<br/>\nmint/lemonbalm lotion or lip balm, we&#39;ll see if we get that done in time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n  -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;What if there was no gravity, but we all held on<br/>\nto something really tight??&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) who says &quot;Odwalla!&quot; (her favorite treat at the store)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sonia Ulan","from":"Sonia Ulan &lt;sulan@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"r68nYK4iy_K7BuMQ1GIIX_briVy1-TmtSJeJefadV1HZb8MRLdm3cAwIgUXCSXQYGTHUnNQl3UnAw3jdggcg3PT3","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] 2 good holiday gift ideas","postDate":"976530185","msgId":14480,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBMzRBQjA5LkFDNjZDOTJGQGhvbWUuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDk3NjQ0NzMwNC41MzkyMUBlZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDAwM2EwMWMwNjJkZiRhZjI1ZTgyMCQ5OGQ0MGUzZkA4MzhmMzAxPg=="},"prevInTopic":14479,"nextInTopic":14486,"prevInTime":14479,"nextInTime":14481,"topicId":14474,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for the craft ideas Robin!
