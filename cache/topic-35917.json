I try to explain it this way when I get into a discussion with my friends who also homeschool but do not unschool. It is difficult because they think I am weird and wacky for trusting that my kids WILL learn what they need to. And not that I need to cram it down their throats. I am still growing and learning how not to school them. It is a process and I am getting somewhere in that process. I feel so passionately that this is the right way for us. that it is usually hard to express to others.

She seems to be interested <br/>\n. . . and often asks to sit on the potty seat if for nothing else then to <br/>\nenjoy the &quot;thrill&quot; of flushing.  (Go figure . . . maybe I thought it was neat <br/>\nto flush the toilet at that age, too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy nephew was not potty-trained until he was almost six.
