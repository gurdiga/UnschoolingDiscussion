When she went to<br/>\ncollege he still liked piano and we tried a different teacher.  It didn&#39;t<br/>\ngo well.  She required homework, a certain amount of practice, lots of<br/>\nexercises etc, and it just wasn&#39;t fun any more.  I talked with her<br/>\nprivately to see if she would just let him play and ease off the other<br/>\nand she said &quot;that&#39;s not how we teach piano!&quot;   My son decided to quit<br/>\nthose lessons but took lessons again when his former instructor came home<br/>\nfor the summer.   He hasn&#39;t taken lessons in a year, but he still plays. <br/>\nHe asked me if we could find another student so he could learn some<br/>\nChristmas songs and I&#39;ll call the high school band teacher today and ask<br/>\nif he knows anyone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe bought the piano before he was taking lessons.  We bought it because<br/>\nit was old and beautiful and an amazing price.  At the time we lived in<br/>\nthe smallest house and we had to put our sofa in the back of my husbands<br/>\ntruck to fit the piano in the living room.  We lived with one chair and a<br/>\npiano bench  for two years before we moved into a bigger place.  We<br/>\nactually discoverd a lot of our friends could play a little when the only<br/>\nplace to sit was at the piano. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nWe bought a used violin so Dylan could mess around with it.  He hasn&#39;t<br/>\nwanted lessons but he enjoys it.  He&#39;s lately playing his recorder and<br/>\nhas asked for bongo drums and we&#39;ll find some somewhere I&#39;m sure.  He<br/>\nplays around with his dads guitar sometimes.  He has tried my brothers<br/>\nflute and we rented a piccolo for a while but he never took lessons.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think any of it is a waste.  He&#39;s getting what he needs for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t push the practice.  Just let her decide the level of<br/>\nparticipation she wants right now.  Maybe the lessons are still fun and<br/>\nthat can&#39;t hurt.   Let it be her choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe found a clarinet for my niece by calling around to some of the folks<br/>\nwho gave lessons and asking where we could find a used clarinet.  One<br/>\nsteered us to a student who had just switched to something else and we<br/>\nbought a fairly good one for $50.00.   It might take a little effort but<br/>\nyou could call music stores and schools and so on and just ask where you<br/>\nmight find a good used flute for a good price.  If you have a symphony in<br/>\nyour area call some of the members who play flute and get their ideas. <br/>\nThere are also pawn shops.   Maybe renting for a while would be ok, until<br/>\nshe knows for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople with little hands can have a hard time with a flute so visiting a<br/>\nmusic store where she could hold one might be good. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Violin lessons... do I PUSH it?","postDate":"1032272789","msgId":44263,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYyOUZVdExjaDl3UGl5QXBod0YwMDAwNTdlNkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":44248,"nextInTopic":44274,"prevInTime":44262,"nextInTime":44264,"topicId":44242,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... unschooling?

I always had to remind them to <br/>\npractice.  My son became tired of practicing the guitar and would <br/>\nprefer just having a guitar around to pick up at his leisure.  My <br/>\noldest daughter tried a few different instruments and regrets giving <br/>\nup the violin. Actually I took her out because I got tired of telling <br/>\nher to get ready for her lessons as she sat on the couch or whatever <br/>\nand wouldn&#39;t get her act together, so I removed the frustration from <br/>\nmy life and took her out.  Like I said before, she now regrets it and <br/>\nwould like to start up again.  My other daughter had to be reminded <br/>\nand told to practice the piano when she first started, but now she is <br/>\nin her seventh year of piano and really enjoys playing. She is past <br/>\nthe struggling part, so that makes it much more fun to play. It is <br/>\nlike having a private concert each day!!! My youngest daughter who <br/>\nwill be ten soon started piano and can&#39;t stand practicing the first <br/>\ntwo days after lessons because it is hard for her.  I know she really <br/>\nwants to play, so I told her she had to practice, or I wasn&#39;t going <br/>\nto continue lessons.  It wasn&#39;t fair to expect us to pay for lessons <br/>\nand to take the time and energy on my part to drive her there if she <br/>\nwasn&#39;t going to do her part.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; She mentions she wants to now play flute, but we shelled out big <br/>\n&gt; bucks for the violin.

My oldest daughter tried the flute, piano and <br/>\nviolin, each reaquiring a rental with the gear that came along with <br/>\nit. At least we owned the piano!  Maybe she could save some $$ from <br/>\nbirthdays or doing small jobs and pay a percentage.

Outlining all the issues -<br/>\nwhat each of you really want from the violin, then together<br/>\nbrainstorming ideas to meet both of your needs?  Just to start while<br/>\nweekly lessons are typical, surely they are not the only way to learn to<br/>\nplay an instrument?  One can spend a lot of time trying things out for<br/>\noneself, one can watch videos, one can take monthly lessons, or perhaps<br/>\na lesson could be booked when your daughter is ready to learn something<br/>\nnew?   <br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine it was a child-size violin?  If so, I imagine she will grow<br/>\nout of it in a few years.  In the meantime she may pick it up a few<br/>\ntimes - she may or may not pursue it more avidly.  It is a fact that<br/>\nthroughout our lives we occasionally wish we had back the money we spent<br/>\n(on getting to a dud of an event, on wedding dresses, or washed out<br/>\nholidays) - perhaps the violin may be one of those, but there is no way<br/>\nto be sure yet.  When the violin is eventually grown out of, if you have<br/>\nno younger children to give it a go, perhaps it might be sold on to<br/>\nanother child who wants to try the violin.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou wrote: <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I had considered stopping paying for lessons <br/>\n&gt;until she gets interested again, but she&#39;ll lose so much if she lets <br/>\n&gt;it slide for a year or more.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What would she lose?  Is it something she can&#39;t find again?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua and I took a few violin lessons - his stopped when he lost<br/>\ninterest, mine when the weekly budget required that money for other<br/>\nthings.  We hadn&#39;t been able to afford to buy violins and had been<br/>\nhiring them, so now I can&#39;t even pick up a violin and give it a go by<br/>\nmyself.  Perhaps it would have been a good idea to layby a violin for<br/>\nmyself and forget about the lessons.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also wish we had a piano in the house so I could play it occasionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t easy choosing how to help our kids with their interests -<br/>\nwanting to try something out can become in a hopeful parent&#39;s eyes the<br/>\nstart of a brilliant career!  It happened that way for me.  And then<br/>\nthere is my frugal side which says - if they aren&#39;t serious about it<br/>\nthen it isn&#39;t worth the money.  Darcy wanted to get taps for his shoes -<br/>\nI started imagining tap dancing lessons.  We have found some tie on taps<br/>\nand if he asks for actual tap shoes or lessons *then* we shall work out<br/>\nhow to do them.  Of course I fear what if I don&#39;t offer what they need,<br/>\nwhat if I don&#39;t spot the latent life-shaping spark that needs to be<br/>\nblown to develop into a flame for my son?
