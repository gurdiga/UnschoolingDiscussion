After reading the various posts, I think we have come to opening the bed in the family room (where the t.v. is and I lay with him while he watched his movie.  He has other movies and I tell him when I am tired and need to go to sleep.  This has been working well so far.  I am open to it for as long as he needs.  I am able to get enough sleep this way and still allow him to make the choices he feels comfortable with.

I wonder if you  <br/>\nreally need to get him even MORE exercise during the day - maybe he  <br/>\nneeds far far more than you do or ever did, more than you can  <br/>\nimagine. Some active kids that age can pretty much go full blast with  <br/>\nintense physical activity all day long - they desperately need that  <br/>\nvery intense strenuous active time - not a few hours a day, but  <br/>\nalmost ALL the time, every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really sounds like he&#39;s not getting worn out enough, physically,  <br/>\nthroughout the day and so ends up the day with a LOT of pent-up  <br/>\nenergy. What you want is for him to be physically tired so that he&#39;s  <br/>\nREADY to have a hot bath, maybe spend some time playing with toys in  <br/>\nthe bathtub, have a cup of warm cocoa and some graham crackers, brush  <br/>\nteeth, get nice clean pajamas on, watch a movie with you while all  <br/>\ncuddled up under a blanket. Lower the lights, watch something he&#39;s  <br/>\nseen before and liked, nothing too thrilling. (Musicals are good.)  <br/>\nThe key to all of this is for him to have many HOURS of intense  <br/>\noutdoor play time every single day. Get a trampoline - get Dance,  <br/>\nDance Revolution. Go to a karate class every day. Swim as much as  <br/>\npossible - consider a swim team so he can swim almost every day.  <br/>\nMaybe tap dance, if he&#39;d like that. Ice skating. Gymnastics can be  <br/>\ngood if there isn&#39;t too much standing around, waiting.  You have to  <br/>\nsupport the REAL child you have - and you have a very physically  <br/>\ndemanding high energy kid. Other people may not have kids who are so  <br/>\nneedy of physical outlet and so may not understand how important it  <br/>\nis for him to burn off all that energy - how exhausting it can be if  <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t get that chance. I don&#39;t think you described his &quot;special  <br/>\nneeds&quot; - but if it includes lack of focus, lack of attention,  <br/>\nhyperactivity, etc., then PLEASE for his sake consider making it a  <br/>\nvery high priority to provide him with MANY hours of free play  <br/>\nphysical activity time as well as possibly some more structured  <br/>\nintense activity time. If you&#39;re thinking of organized sports,  <br/>\nremember that soccer involves much more active play time AND, in  <br/>\ngeneral, is more supportive and positive.

It  <br/>\ncould be a worthwhile conversation - but, ultimately, the real answer  <br/>\nis that whether or not we agree there is a safety issue and even if  <br/>\nwe know WE would never sue them, they are the management and if they  <br/>\ndon&#39;t want us to do that there, we can either go somewhere else or  <br/>\nabide by their wishes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t let the neighbor kids get in and out of the pool, when  <br/>\nthey&#39;re swimming at our house. I don&#39;t let them get out and jump back  <br/>\ninto the pool - even though I know this is fun. I&#39;m not a big mean  <br/>\ncontrolling parent with rules for no reason who likes to have power  <br/>\nkids. And when it is only my own kids in the pool, they can do what  <br/>\nthey want. But it is MY house and my pool and I&#39;m letting them swim  <br/>\nhere and I want them to just stay in the pool. It is nerve-wracking  <br/>\nfor ME when they&#39;re out on the deck and jumping in - I don&#39;t enjoy  <br/>\nmyself, I get more stressed, this is MY issue but so what? I&#39;m &quot;the  <br/>\nmanagement&quot; and if kids want to know why I have this rule, it is hard  <br/>\nto explain about MY psychological processes - how do I tell a five- <br/>\nyear-old that he gets to swim at my house FAR<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think an employee is enforcing a rule that the store  <br/>\nmanagement would NOT agree with, then by all means complain to the  <br/>\nstore management. But if a kid is climbing a store ladder, I bet the  <br/>\nstore management is going to say they don&#39;t want him to do that. They  <br/>\nmight cite safety issues, but it might just be that they just don&#39;t  <br/>\nlike it. They get to decide - they&#39;re the &quot;management.&quot; If WE think  <br/>\nthe management of a store is so unfriendly to kids that we don&#39;t want  <br/>\nour kids exposed to it, then we can shop without our kids or shop  <br/>\nsomewhere else. And we can complain to management about employees who  <br/>\nbehave rudely to our kids, especially if it is in a place where kids  <br/>\nare presumably welcome (like a kids&#39; museum, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt HOME, we get to decide how much freedom our kids will have. People  <br/>\nhere argue that there are wonderful benefits of giving kids FAR more  <br/>\nfreedom than typical/conventional parents. And we can find ways to  <br/>\ngive our kids more freedom outside our homes, too, especially by  <br/>\nfinding friends who share our parenting philosophies and spending  <br/>\nlots of time in kid-friendly places. But there are people who are  <br/>\nhandicapping their kids by NOT helping them understand that  life  <br/>\nwill be more difficult for them if they don&#39;t learn to discern when  <br/>\nand where to insist on &quot;their way&quot; and when to abide by other  <br/>\npeoples&#39; wishes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese aren&#39;t moral or ethical choices - I mean, there ARE times to  <br/>\nstand up to authorities even WHEN they are &quot;in charge&quot; - there are  <br/>\nmost definitely times to refuse to abide by management&#39;s desires.  <br/>\nRosa Parks refusing to give up her seat is a perfect example. In 1966  <br/>\nor so, my dad was working on getting financing for a customer of his  <br/>\n(my dad owned an industrial building construction company) when he  <br/>\nsuddenly realized that his bank was engaging in outright  <br/>\ndiscrimination against the customer because of his race. My dad could  <br/>\nhave said, &quot;Well, it is their bank,&quot; but he didn&#39;t - he asked to  <br/>\nspeak to the bank manager and closed his multi-million dollar  <br/>\nbusiness accounts with that bank, on the spot. And he reported them  <br/>\nto various agencies.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there are times to take a stand and refuse to go along with other  <br/>\npeople&#39;s desires/rules/etc! But life is smoother and happier when  <br/>\npeople accept that there are times to respect other peoples&#39; rights  <br/>\nto be seemingly arbitrary in their OWN spheres of control. When this  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t involve any kind of moral/ethical/right versus wrong/serious  <br/>\ncompromise of standards - then creating harmony and happiness and  <br/>\npeace in the world is ALSO valuable and worthwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed that some who love the whole radical unschooling/ <br/>\nrespectful parenting approach can really go too far - maybe it is  <br/>\nthose who felt extremely controlled as a kid, themselves, and are  <br/>\nsaying, &quot;I&#39;m NOT doing that to my kid and I&#39;m not going to let  <br/>\nanybody ELSE do it to my kid, either.&quot; Which is good - I&#39;m glad there  <br/>\nare so many of us who are finding ways to give our kids so much more  <br/>\nfreedom! But I see a &quot;defiance&quot; sometimes - like they&#39;ve not let go  <br/>\nof the &quot;rigidity&quot; of the controlling parenting style - but they&#39;re  <br/>\napplying that &quot;rigidity&quot; to making sure their kid doesn&#39;t get  <br/>\ncontrolled in any way by anybody. In a way, those parents are still  <br/>\nBEING controlled - if they are still reacting &quot;against&quot; the way they  <br/>\nwere raised. It is possible to move beyond that - to even more  <br/>\nmindful parenting which will be less hostile, less defensive, calmer,  <br/>\nmore peaceful, and allow for sometimes going along with controls and  <br/>\nnot feeling &quot;bristly&quot; over things like a grocery store employee  <br/>\nasking kids not to climb on the store ladder.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that also there is a further and higher level of trust in our  <br/>\nchildren that we can reach, as well, if we&#39;ve protected and respected  <br/>\nthem when they were little and helped them learn how to respond to  <br/>\nother people being arbitrary and controlling, then we don&#39;t have to  <br/>\nconstantly be on guard to create a world/environment around them that  <br/>\nis absolutely respectful and courteous and never arbitrary - at  <br/>\nleast, as they get older, they&#39;ll be able to appropriately respond to  <br/>\nit themselves and make their own decisions about going along or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if we&#39;re talking about a 3 year old climbing on a store  <br/>\nladder, the parent might hug the child sweetly while removing him  <br/>\nfrom the steps and give him a kiss and say, &quot;They don&#39;t want us to  <br/>\nclimb their ladder in this store,&quot; and move quickly on to, &quot;Hey do  <br/>\nyou want to pick out cereal?&quot; If we&#39;re talking about a 5 year old,  <br/>\nthe parent might say, &quot;I know you&#39;re a safe ladder climber, but they  <br/>\ndon&#39;t know that here, so that&#39;s why they don&#39;t want you to climb -  <br/>\nmakes them too nervous. But, hey, when we get home do you want to get  <br/>\nour BIG ladder out and climb up it?&quot; If we&#39;re talking to a 9 year  <br/>\nold, we might have a more in-depth conversation about arbitrary rules  <br/>\nand why stores have them and it might get into lawsuits and how some  <br/>\npeople will sue for anything and what happens to prices because of  <br/>\nthat and on and on. If we&#39;re talking about a 13 year old, depending  <br/>\non the kid, the parent might not say a word, just let the kid decide  <br/>\nhow to respond. If the employee is rude, then I do think it is  <br/>\nappropriate for a parent to say, &quot;No need to be rude,&quot; or something  <br/>\nlike that. When the kids are getting up into their teens, I do think  <br/>\nthe parents should, at that point, more and more trust their kids to  <br/>\ndecide if they want to address rudeness or arbitrariness or whatever,  <br/>\nnot do it &quot;for&quot; them, even if it annoys the parent. This comes up  <br/>\nbecause teens DO quite often get spoken to rudely by people &quot;in  <br/>\nauthority&quot; and I know I &quot;bristle&quot; - it brings back my own teen years  <br/>\nof being treated less than respectfully. But I think my kids have the  <br/>\nright to decide if this is a time that they want the rudeness  <br/>\naddressed or not - so I will sometimes bite my tongue and let it  <br/>\nslide. The kids know my urge to &quot;protect their environment&quot; is still  <br/>\nstrong and sometimes they&#39;ll even say, quietly, &quot;It is okay, mom,  <br/>\njust ignore it.&quot;  BUT, they will also sometimes ask me to step in -  <br/>\nas Roya did at the CIty Museum in St. Louis when an employee was very  <br/>\nrude to her and some other kids. She knows that if she asks, that I  <br/>\nwill try to at least lodge a complaint about that employee - assuming  <br/>\nthat if there are enough complaints that something will be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - it is a balance we all have to find and well worth  <br/>\ndiscussing. Interesting how the issue doesn&#39;t really disappear as the  <br/>\nkids grow up, it changes form but we continue to deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209676473,"authorName":"joanne","from":"&quot;joanne&quot; &lt;oh.kneel@...&gt;","profile":"kc2ark","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Detoxing","postDate":"1130603466","msgId":109167,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGYwMWM1ZGNhNiQyOWMwZjMwMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBKb2FubmU+","referencesHeader":"PGRrMDZzNytjZnFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":109161,"nextInTopic":109169,"prevInTime":109166,"nextInTime":109168,"topicId":109139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Also for me as a parent I do not want my child to run wildly through the stores per se but if he has decided to take off I have to catch him first to stop him.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-15110216\">Also for me as a parent I do not want my child to run wildly through the stores per se but if he has decided to take off I have to catch him first to stop him.

I was starting to fwonder if perhaps I didn&#39;t fit in with this group. As if everything my son was doing was somehow related to something I as doing wrong.  I know I have a lot to learn but my son has always been like this. It is nothing new.   My son has VERY High energy.  A psychiatrist had  suggested that he be put on medication so that his language issues could better be addressed.  I have MS so I can only run around with him for so long.  I am still not really sure how I am suppose to highlight what you wrote so that can respond but I will try to do it correctly this time.  But now have found that the way I did it doens&#39;t allow me to spell check the resposnes I wrote in the body of your text.  YIKES!!!  <br/>\n  ***Do you mean food wrappers and that sort of thing? Is he doing it on <br/>\n  purpose***<br/>\n<br/>\n  I really don&#39;t think so.  It doesn&#39;t seem mean or defiant.  It just seems like he is done with something so he is getting it out of his way.  I continue to ask each time if he could either give it to me or leave it so that mommy doesn&#39;t have to pick it up off the floor.  I explained that then I have more work to do which makes less time I can play with him.  He gets it at the moment but then seems to forget the next time. <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n  ***Well, he has a point i think. You told him what you needed, but not <br/>\n  much info about how to address *his* needs. That doesnt always mean <br/>\n  your needs go out the window (although i think the younger the child, the less your needs get attention)...playing tag probably seemed pretty important to him at the time. Maybe you could have <br/>\n  said &quot;i&#39;ll play tag for ten minutes but then i need to do something less active&quot;...compromised? ***<br/>\n<br/>\n  That probably would have been a good idea.  I had played tag with them already before we left to go to the library so that I was just feeling a bit tired.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ***Do you think he wouldve accepted compromising? He <br/>\n  and his friend playing tag while you watch?***  <br/>\n<br/>\n  My ds seems to get a very specifc idea in his head about what he wants.  He almost gets stuck there.  I have seen it with me and with his freinds.  He seems to have trouble compromising at those times and just keeps saying what he wants over and over again.  If after playing tag or whatever game for quite a while, when I want to stop he gets very upset.  I remind him how many minutes are left so the transition is not a surprise and he still says it is too short.  If we can only do what he wants all of the time I end up feeling a bit like I am being controlled by a five year old.  It doesn&#39;t feel good.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ***Is this something <br/>\n  ongoing (him wanting to do something really active in the evening, <br/>\n  you wanting to relax), or is it mostly because of a friend being <br/>\n  there?***<br/>\n<br/>\n  No he usually wants to keep playing actively after dinner.  In the past we have tried to redirect or distract him.  But as I am learning about unschooling I am also learning that I need to really hear his needs and then help support him in creatively finding ways to meet those needs. <br/>\n<br/>\n  ***Is this something he just started since leaving school, or is it <br/>\n  typical behavior?***<br/>\n<br/>\n  Typical behavior for him. He has difficulty with transitioning from one activity to another even when enjoys the one we are transitioning to<br/>\n<br/>\n  ***What have you told him about unschooling? Did he want to leave school? Are there parts about it he misses, that he&#39;s upset at having to leave(friends, toys, routine?)***  My ds had not wanted to go to school when he was younger (3-5) but since he has special needs we thought that we were doing the best things for him by sending him to experts that &quot;specialize&quot; in these things.  He is happy to be home.  He wanted to try kindergarten since it was a new school but after a few days didn&#39;t want to go anymore.  We had told him that if he wanted to stop he could stay home. We explained that there were different ways to do school.  We haven&#39;t really clarified for him the difference between home schooling and unshcooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  *** Keep <br/>\n  talking to him, explaining *why*, getting his input, asking for his <br/>\n  help. I think it will get better with time, at least in my <br/>\n  experience.****  <br/>\n  Thanks you for the encouragement and the support.

Its good to know that you are handling it <br/>\ncalmly...i wasnt very good at it then. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf i had to do it over again, i wouldve spent more time being his <br/>\npartner, instead of the &quot;mom who has to chase him down and strap him <br/>\ninto the cart&quot;...i wouldve started earlier, as a toddler, exploring <br/>\nthe store with him, looking at anything he wanted to, including him <br/>\nin the process instead of making shopping something i was doing TO <br/>\nhim. Its hard to know if it wouldve changed his behavior, but it <br/>\nwouldve changed our relationship i think.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for doing things like climbing on the employee ladders...my son <br/>\nstill does that, at age 9. He always comes down when i ask now <br/>\nthough (not without protest)...i think for some kids, its just too <br/>\ntempting. Maybe if you see something like that try to distract him, <br/>\ndont go down the aisle, maybe really get into talking about it, what <br/>\nits used for, talk to him about why he can&#39;t be on it. For me, those <br/>\nsituations kind of suck, because i feel like i&#39;m forced to enforce <br/>\nthe store&#39;s rule or get yelled at by some salesperson, when very <br/>\noften their fears are unfounded (would your son *really* get hurt by <br/>\nclimbing up a couple of steps, and then down, with you watching, <br/>\nkeeping him safe? Probably not, and yet i know i feel like i&#39;m <br/>\nletting my son do &quot;bad&quot; if i allow it.) We got yelled at (well, in a <br/>\nvery singsongy polite way)by the lady at the shoestore in the mall <br/>\nthe other day. Seamus was trying on shoes, and was running up and <br/>\ndown the (carpeted, empty,short)aisle we were in, to see if the <br/>\nshoes would fall off when he ran (they did). &quot;No running, i dont <br/>\nwant you to get hurt&quot;...i said &quot;oh he&#39;s just testing out his <br/>\nshoes&quot; &quot;I know, but i dont want him to get hurt&quot;...there was zero <br/>\nchance of him getting hurt, but yet we were still reprimanded. So i <br/>\ncan see how a kid might not fully buy into WHY he can&#39;t do <br/>\nsomething, because oftentimes there isnt a real good reason behind <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Another on going challenge ds  just takes something he does want <br/>\n&gt;and throws it on the floor.  (I  have asked if he could put it in <br/>\n&gt;the garbage or give it to me or  leave it on the table.....) <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you mean food wrappers and that sort of thing? Is he doing it on <br/>\npurpose (defiantly, like &quot;There YOU pick it up!&quot;), or is he just <br/>\nforgetful? My son does this quite often...like sometimes it doesnt <br/>\neven *occur* to him that we have these things called garbage cans. <br/>\nJust a bit ago, i asked him (i had been in another room), did you <br/>\nthrow your paper plate in the garbage? &quot;oh i&#39;ll go do it!&quot;...later i <br/>\ngo in, yes he threw out the plate, but left the ketchup sitting on <br/>\nthe table. Didnt think &quot;oh on my way to the garbage, i&#39;ll stick this <br/>\nin the fridge. &quot; He isnt doing it to be wasteful (i&#39;ve had to throw <br/>\nout food that he&#39;s left out overnight), or to be disrespectful, i <br/>\nthink its just how is mind works...he&#39;s thinking too quickly, and <br/>\nonce he&#39;s done he&#39;s onto the next thought, which isnt usually &quot;now i <br/>\nshould clean up.&quot; Not sure if its the &quot;correct&quot; thing to do, but i <br/>\nusually just pick it up and throw it away. Sometimes i <br/>\ncomment &quot;you&#39;ve left wrappers on the floor&quot; and either wait a bit <br/>\nfor him to clean them up, or do it myself. Its improved as he&#39;s <br/>\ngotten older, and i think he&#39;ll get better at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Another episode, after dinner Ds wants  me to play tag (again) with <br/>\n&gt;he and his friend.  I say (which is  consistent on my part) that <br/>\n&gt;after dinner mommy likes to wind down.   I like to read and be <br/>\n&gt;quieter and get ready for bed.  I would be <br/>\n&gt; happy to watch a movie with him.  He then gets angry and tells me <br/>\n&gt; that Since I don&#39;t do his needs he is not listening to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, he has a point i think. You told him what you needed, but not <br/>\nmuch info about how to address *his* needs. That doesnt always mean <br/>\nyour needs go out the window (although i think the younger the <br/>\nchild, the less your needs get attention)...playing tag probably <br/>\nseemed pretty important to him at the time. Maybe you could have <br/>\nsaid &quot;i&#39;ll play tag for ten minutes but then i need to do something <br/>\nless active&quot;...compromised? I think in another post you wrote that <br/>\nhis friend agreed to the movie and you both were trying to convince <br/>\nhim....maybe he felt ganged up on, like his friend didnt even have <br/>\nhis back yknow? Do you think he wouldve accepted compromising? He <br/>\nand his friend playing tag while you watch? Is this something <br/>\nongoing (him wanting to do something really active in the evening, <br/>\nyou wanting to relax), or is it mostly because of a friend being <br/>\nthere? If it wasnt a regular thing i think i&#39;d have just done what <br/>\nhe wanted. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;This  time I wait. He doesn&#39;t throw his food on the floor, he <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t run  out the door, he doesn&#39;t start knocking things over.  <br/>\n&gt;But he has  done all of those things at others times this week. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is this something he just started since leaving school, or is it <br/>\ntypical behavior? My son would have horrible outburts when things <br/>\ndidnt go as planned, or as he wanted, and theyve gotten much less <br/>\nfrequent as he&#39;s gotten older (maybe just a few times a year <br/>\nnow?)...so if its just a part of his personality, and how he deals <br/>\nwith anger, then thats not really an unschooling issue, its more an <br/>\nissue of helping him transition without getting upset. But if its <br/>\nnew behavior that has started very recently, maybe its his response <br/>\nto the big change of leaving school. Maybe he feels like his whole <br/>\nworld has turned upside down and he doesnt know what to expect. What <br/>\nhave you told him about unschooling? Did he want to leave school? <br/>\nAre there parts about it he misses, that he&#39;s upset at having to <br/>\nleave(friends, toys, routine?)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of what you have described sounds like typical behavior for MY <br/>\nkid...but it is very hard sometimes to get through it, i know. Keep <br/>\ntalking to him, explaining *why*, getting his input, asking for his <br/>\nhelp. I think it will get better with time, at least in my <br/>\nexperience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59925222,"authorName":"queenjane555","from":"&quot;queenjane555&quot; &lt;queenjane555@...&gt;","profile":"queenjane555","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Detoxing","postDate":"1130559904","msgId":109147,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRqdXRqMCtlbWxhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRqdWc3aCt2NnJhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":109145,"nextInTopic":109148,"prevInTime":109146,"nextInTime":109148,"topicId":109139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I think i&#39;d need more info to <br/>\nknow what the situation is...what time do you go to bed? Before you <br/>\ngo to sleep, do you make up a comfy place for your son so he can <br/>\nfall asleep when he wants to? Is he watching tv?Playing on the <br/>\ncomputer? Playing quietly in his room? Its hard for me to remember <br/>\nthe exact ages that my son was doing things (he is 9, today <br/>\nactually!)but i think at 5, i might have made him a comfy &quot;bed&quot; on <br/>\nthe couch or floor in front of the tv, and made sure he had plenty <br/>\nof tapes (or cartoon cable channel, if we had it), also made sure he <br/>\nhad something to drink handy and maybe a snack. He mightve come to <br/>\nbed with me later on, or more likely fallen asleep where he was. <br/>\nSometimes, if we had a little tv in our room (cosleeping), i&#39;d go to <br/>\nsleep while he was watching a tape. I dont particularly like going <br/>\nto sleep with a light on (from nightlight or tv)but am willing to <br/>\nsacrifice usually esp when he was younger. Now, when we stay at my <br/>\nmom&#39;s (i take care of her a few days out of the week, and stay at <br/>\nher house on those days), Seamus usually plays computer quietly <br/>\nwhile i sleep (same room). At our own apt i usually will go to sleep <br/>\non my own (ahhh darkness!)and he comes later. Havent had much luck <br/>\ngetting to him to sleep in his own room yet though. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son usually goes to sleep around 2-4am and sleeps til 11am-1pm <br/>\n(varies.) So i dont think your son staying up late and sleeping in <br/>\nare worrisome alone. Why is he cranky? Because you&#39;re waking him <br/>\nearlier than he&#39;d like? Does he *want* to take the riding lesson? <br/>\nCan he take a lesson later in the day? Might he prefer to postpone <br/>\nthem for now and keep his later schedule? Given my son&#39;s preference <br/>\nfor sleeping in, i wouldnt schedule him for anything before <br/>\nafternoon time. Luckily, i prefer a &quot;second shift&quot; schedule as well <br/>\n(so do most members of my extended family, i think its genetic!)so i <br/>\ndon&#39;t have too many judgements that he &quot;should&quot; be up by a certain <br/>\ntime...it would cause WAY more problems for me if he woke at 6a and <br/>\nwent to bed at 8p or something. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a more gentle way to wake your son (if that applies), give <br/>\nhim more time to wake up? Sometimes if i do need to wake my son <br/>\nbefore he&#39;s really ready to wake up, it might take an hour to get <br/>\nhim fully awake. Also, do you talk with him the night before about <br/>\nhis commitments the next day? <br/>\n<br/>\nHas your son been in school? How long has he been unschooling? I <br/>\nthought perhaps he hadnt been in school long if he&#39;s only 5, but <br/>\nthen remembered there is daycare and preschool that might be an <br/>\nissue as well. What was your bedtime routine before embracing <br/>\nradical unschooling? How did you transition to &quot;no bedtimes&quot;? We&#39;ve <br/>\nnever really had set bedtimes, so this hasnt been much of an issue <br/>\nfor our family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll reply to the rest of your post in another post so this won&#39;t <br/>\nget too long.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209676473,"authorName":"joanne","from":"&quot;joanne&quot; &lt;oh.kneel@...&gt;","profile":"kc2ark","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Detoxing","postDate":"1130551413","msgId":109145,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzkwMWM1ZGMyYyRmNzU0MzU5MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBKb2FubmU+","referencesHeader":"PDE5YS4zZmNlMzI5Yy4zMDk0MjdmZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":109143,"nextInTopic":109147,"prevInTime":109144,"nextInTime":109146,"topicId":109139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I had to read you response several times.

We are new to unschooling <br/>\nand actually feel that the best match for our son and our family <br/>\nwould be what is now loosely described as radical unschooling.  But <br/>\nmy dh and I are really detoxing!  I will only speak for myself from <br/>\nthis point on but I feel like I am on an emotional roller coaster.  <br/>\nDs (5) digss up all the shale from the back path to make a volcano.  <br/>\nDH and I both have strong feelings but work it through had allow him <br/>\nto proceed without dumping any further judgment on him.  He makes an <br/>\nawesome volcano which then the family fills with baking soda and <br/>\nvinegar and it erupts.  It was just great.  Another episode, DS is <br/>\nnow choosing to stay up very late (way past us guessing 3:00 a.m. or <br/>\nso) and is sleeping past noon.  When we wake him for his horseback <br/>\nriding lesson he is angry that he has been woken.  Now dh and I are <br/>\nwondering if we are doing the wrong thing allowing him to choose <br/>\nwhen he is sleeping half the day and so cranky.  Another episode, ds <br/>\ngoes to store and gets overstimulated (my fault ad choice for him) <br/>\nand climbs up the metal staircase for employees and won&#39;t get down.  <br/>\nThen when he does runs all over the store as I try to chase him (and <br/>\ncatch him).  When I catch him his body almost seems to relax.  I <br/>\nthen carry him out of the store.  I feel frazzled but glad I can <br/>\ntalk with him calming not get angry.  Another on going challenge ds <br/>\njust takes something he does want and throws it on the floor.  (I <br/>\nhave asked if he could put it in the garbage or give it to me or <br/>\nleave it on the table.....)  Another episode, after dinner Ds wants <br/>\nme to play tag (again) with he and his friend.  I say (which is <br/>\nconsistent on my part) that after dinner mommy likes to wind down.  <br/>\nI like to read and be quieter and get ready for bed.  I would be <br/>\nhappy to watch a movie with him.  He then gets angry and tells me <br/>\nthat Since I don&#39;t do his needs he is not listening to me.  This <br/>\ntime I wait. He doesn&#39;t throw his food on the floor, he doesn&#39;t run <br/>\nout the door, he doesn&#39;t start knocking things over.  But he has <br/>\ndone all of those things at others times this week.  So I guess I am <br/>\nsaying that we are transitioning and like giving birth it is <br/>\nuncomfortable and hard work at times.  I am not someone who cries <br/>\neasily and yet I feel teary.  I am tired. I am sad for the time I <br/>\nhad put him in school.  I am frustrated that I can&#39;t reach him <br/>\nbetter at times.  I am ashamed that I don&#39;t know more about what to <br/>\ndo to diffuse the situation.  I offer to come close.  I offer to <br/>\nhold him.  I offer to give him space.  I just want someone to know <br/>\nthat we are hurting.  When you drink too much and discover you are <br/>\nan alcoholic, one can chose to detox and then begin to recover one <br/>\nday at a time.  Well we lived a way that was unhelpful to ds and <br/>\nhave discovered that we need to detox from not only school and <br/>\nexpectations but our own upbringings.  We have a strong desire to <br/>\nfind a new way for ds and us but it is really hard right now.  I <br/>\njust didn&#39;t want to be alone with all of these new feelings.  Sorry <br/>\nfor the lengthy share.  I just needed to know someone out there <br/>\nmight be able to offer me some hope.  Joanne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109208,"nextTopicId":109215}}
