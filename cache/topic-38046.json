I was talking with some ladies at church that homeSCHOOL and I put that emphasis there for obvious reasons. They usually make fun of me because they like to say that I do not ever teach my kids and they dont learn anything either. I think they are just jealous. <br/>\nAnyhow, they were wondering how I respond to naysayers and rabid anti homeschoolers. I told them that other peoples opinions of me are none of my business. I thought it was brilliant. :-) (So thanks Tia...) They didnt get it! I think that they didnt get it because when we do hear others opinions of us we may tend to change what we are doing to conform to those said opinions. I think they would LIKE to unschool but feel that they could not because others may think that they are &quot;doing nothing&quot;. I told them I dont want to change from what I am doing because it works for me and my kids. I am not sure whether they got it then or not but they understood I think.<br/>\nAnyhow that was my AHHAH!!! moment for the weekend and I thought I would share!<br/>\n God bless<br/>\nVivian<br/>\nMom to three Happy little Monkeys<br/>\nAustin 10/31/93 Sarah 8/28/95 Emmalee 8/15/00<br/>\nAnd loving wife to Randy<br/>\n<br/>\n**If fifty million people say a foolish thing, it is still a foolish thing.<br/>\n-Anatole France***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Tia&#39;s sig line","postDate":"1023071326","msgId":38088,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDYwMjE5MjcyMi4wMjhmYTc0MEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDI4LjI3NzBiMDJmLjJhMmFmZDI3QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":38065,"nextInTopic":38094,"prevInTime":38087,"nextInTime":38089,"topicId":38046,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
