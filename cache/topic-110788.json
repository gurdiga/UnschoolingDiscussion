I&#39;m doing a holiday CD swap (getting my boss to listen to Gatto&#39;s &quot;Seven Lesson Schoolteacher&quot; while he has me listen to Friedman&#39;s book on tape) and I was curious if anyone had any opinions on him from an unschooling perspective - the folks at work talk about him all the time (we make self-directed technology curriculum software) and I managed to find a site that uses gatto and friedman to discuss the different sides of open-source programming... I figured I&#39;d listen to &quot;The World is Flat&quot; before forming any solid opinions, but I wanted to know what other unschoolers thought of him.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  -Jason<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
