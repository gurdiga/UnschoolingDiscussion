They showed me what compassion, gratitude, love, honesty, <br/>\npatience, understanding, limits, personal boundaries, beauty and <br/>\ncourage (just to name a few) really were. They give me these gifts <br/>\nevery moment of everyday I spend with them.  They encourage me to be <br/>\nthe best person I can be (Ned, it&#39;s called self-awareness and <br/>\nemotional intelligence - have you heard of it? :) and I do the same <br/>\nfor them.

To me, it means, simply, no<br/>\nschooling. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some of the things talked about like; allowing the child to decide<br/>\n&gt; what he/she watches on TV and for how long, what to eat and when,<br/>\n&gt; when to go to bed, whether to brush teeth etc are, I thought,<br/>\n&gt; parenting choices.  Even children who go to school have these issues.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, every family must deal with those issues individually. They are under<br/>\nParenting, not &quot;education.&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So if these are part of unschooling how do they learn self-<br/>\n&gt; discipline, self-control and good life habits? Do you just use<br/>\n&gt; natural consequences for everything?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Many seem to think that if a parent sits back and has &quot;good thoughts&quot; about<br/>\ntheir child, that the child will do what that parent imagines is the &quot;right<br/>\nthing.&quot; <br/>\nSuch parents are kidding themselves. Get a parenting book (maybe five) if<br/>\nyou have no idea how to raise a kid. Parenting is not something adults are<br/>\nsuddenly able to do just because they have a kid. It is hard work, much like<br/>\nany relationship. Your questions make it difficult to know where to start in<br/>\na serious answer. You seem to need to start pretty near the beginning.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; How does religion work with unschooling?  Do people who are devout<br/>\n&gt; believers &#39;teach&#39; their children their &#39;beliefs&#39;?  If a child asks<br/>\n&gt; about God do they get the parents &#39;beliefs&#39; as truth?  Same for non-<br/>\n&gt; believers too? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your attitude will determine how your child responds to your religion. My<br/>\nexperience tells me that children who see the benefits of their parents&#39;<br/>\nfaith, usually respond agreeably. Those who have it stuffed down their<br/>\nthroats, usually don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe old testament is about rules that say, &quot;Don&#39;t&quot;  --&quot; Thou Shalt NOT....&quot;<br/>\nBut the new testament is more positive -- the Beatitudes -- &quot;Blessed are the<br/>\npeacemakers,&quot; etc.<br/>\nThe new testament shows how far people came the period that the Bible<br/>\ndescribes. It was a period of great self-examination and discovery.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or do you say &quot;this is what I believe and some people<br/>\n&gt; believe such and such, and in your life the choice is yours what you<br/>\n&gt; choose to believe&quot; or something like that?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That sounds most agreeable to me. That will be true no matter what we do, so<br/>\nit seems best to start out with that attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41515,"nextTopicId":41564}}
