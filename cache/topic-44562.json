Thanks so much!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>7/8ths is a really odd size, and extremely uncommon in any string<br/>\ninstrument, but particularly cellos.  Most children under 5 feet use a 3/4th<br/>\nsize (or smaller).  You should be able to rent or buy one of those from any<br/>\nmusic store, but you&#39;re likely to get a nicer sounding instrument from an<br/>\nactual string instrument dealer.  These are the folks that sell, make,<br/>\nrepair string instruements and don&#39;t have shops full of synthasizers, band<br/>\ninstruments, etc.  (Music stores are great.  I&#39;ve worked for them, and buy<br/>\nfrom them.  But they don&#39;t generally know strings very well.)  Check under<br/>\nviolin shops in the yellow pages, or visit www.stringsmagazine.com.  They<br/>\nhave a Buyer&#39;s Guide which includes a world-wide directory of shops and<br/>\nmakers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe 7/8ths size was originally intended to be an instrument a little bigger<br/>\nthan a 3/4ths for a budding prodigy, so they could have more size and hence<br/>\nmore sound, without straining their body.  Generally they are violinists,<br/>\nsince the physical difference between 3/4 and 4/4 size is significantly more<br/>\nstrenuous on the neck of a child.  Because a cello rests on the floor, this<br/>\ndifference is irrelevant.  If a child can handle a full size, they play it.<br/>\nMost 3/4 size cellos don&#39;t have the &quot;tinny&quot; tone associated with smaller<br/>\nsize violins, simply because cellos are bigger in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease check with a teacher, instrument dealer or other professional before<br/>\nyou buy; there&#39;s a lot of difference between instruments, and it would be<br/>\nsad to be dissappointed by what you get.  If your daughter doesn&#39;t play yet,<br/>\nfind a cellist who can play it for you so you can hear the instrument.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my field; if you think that can help you in any other way, please<br/>\nemail me off list.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112087015,"authorName":"luv2unskool","from":"&quot;luv2unskool&quot; &lt;cmr0523@...&gt;","profile":"luv2unskool","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: CELLO WANTED","postDate":"1032839213","msgId":44569,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFtb243ZCtsb2YwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNTEwMWMyNjM3NyRkNDFiMWQ0MCQ2NTAwYThjMEBXb3JrZ3JvdXA+"},"prevInTopic":44565,"nextInTopic":44580,"prevInTime":44568,"nextInTime":44570,"topicId":44562,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would appreciate that - I m about to purchase an inexpensive student cello, but would rather have an older, better quality one.
