Maybe some of you can help her, though:<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHello everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\na short introduction first:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m Satu, an unschooling mother of two (4- and 6 years) from Helsinki.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re probably the only unschooling family in Finland, so you can <br/>\n<br/>\njust imagine the overwhelming support... :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBeen lurking on this list quite awhile, but never got around posting <br/>\n<br/>\nanything. And now I&#39;ve landed into a little problem, hoping you might <br/>\n<br/>\nbe able to help: Last winter I ran accross an american unschooling-site, <br/>\n<br/>\nin which there was a page including a &#39;form&#39; or such, meant to be <br/>\n<br/>\nused as a model, if any family needs to give reasons for their choise <br/>\n<br/>\nto unschool, in case there&#39;re problems with the state or with the school <br/>\n<br/>\ndistrict, when a more curriculum-based approach is demanded etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole concept of unschooling was very well and closely argued, <br/>\n<br/>\nas well as was the position of parents as the best possible &#39;teachers&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nfor their own children. I didn&#39;t bookmark the page at the time, and now <br/>\n<br/>\nI could really make a use of it (I&#39;d like to use the format and the model as <br/>\n<br/>\nthe basis for my own letter: I&#39;m putting together some papers for our school <br/>\n<br/>\nofficials, and I want to do it so well the first time they won&#39;t have a <br/>\nreason to <br/>\n<br/>\nbother us afterwards - I know, I know, I&#39;m a born optimist...) :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t remember excactly where that particular page was, but <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a feeling, it was put there by a small support group or such, <br/>\n<br/>\nwhich could have been on the east coast... But I&#39;m not definate, <br/>\n<br/>\nand I don&#39;t seem to find it with any search engine either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would really really appreciate your help, if you happen to know <br/>\n<br/>\nwhat site I&#39;m referring to. Or if you know any similar pages or <br/>\n<br/>\nsuch, please, give me a hint! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSatu <br/>\n----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent her a link to Carol Narigon&#39;s curriculum, in case that&#39;s what she had <br/>\nseen (and for the benefit of anyone else who hasn&#39;t seen that, it&#39;s at http:/<br/>\n/expage.com/CarolNarigonCurriculum , and what it is is a description of <br/>\nunschooling in terms a school district might relate to).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of you know of other such forms or summaries, please post them to this <br/>\nlist and/or send them directly to Satu (who isn&#39;t on this list) at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hanhijoki@...\">hanhijoki@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24498,"nextTopicId":24465}}
