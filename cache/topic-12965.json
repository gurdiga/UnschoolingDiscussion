If he draws a square<br/>\nand you say, &quot;Great square! I love how you mixed red with purple&quot; and he<br/>\nsays &quot;What&#39;s a square?&quot; you would tell him and if he seemed interested could<br/>\npoint to a rectangular box of crackers and tell him what that shape is, and<br/>\na circular window and tell him that.

Motive counts in unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i&#39;m just very concerned they will not learn all the things they need to<br/>\n&gt; know to get into a college.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What if they don&#39;t want to go to college? :) It&#39;s not a death sentence. And<br/>\neven if they do want to go to college, unschoolers can and do and have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;i&#39;ve never given my children tests but i would<br/>\n&gt; imagine one day i will so they will be prepared for college.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure. And if they show interest in college as they get toward &quot;college age&quot;<br/>\nyou can point out to them that knowing how to take tests there will be a<br/>\nuseful skill, and you can help them find practice tests and such that they<br/>\ncan do. But to start testing early a child who might not even want college<br/>\nis unnecessary -- a five or eight year old unschooled child is a long way<br/>\nfrom college, and learning how to take tests doesn&#39;t require years to<br/>\nmaster.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;i do understand<br/>\n&gt; lots of learning comes from daily life,but i don&#39;t see how my children<br/>\n&gt; could ever figure out how to add fractions with different denominators if i<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t show them by giving them work.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If they have a need to know how to figure out how to add fractions with<br/>\ndifferent denominators, they will either develop the skill on their own (I<br/>\nknow it&#39;s hard to believe from where you&#39;re sitting now. I may be a radical<br/>\nunschooler but I was still pretty astounded when my always-unschooled<br/>\nnever-seen-a-math-worksheet daughter made up her own one day, for fun, and<br/>\nshowed me later) or, if you see they have a real-life need for that skill<br/>\nright then, you can offer to show them how to do it.

The point is that whatever it is that your <br/>\nkids want to do, you figure out a way to do it if at all possible.<br/>\n     My daughter is upset about our town banning skateboards and <br/>\nscooters, so we&#39;re into this huge civics project, walking the town <br/>\ndoing a survey (and we&#39;ll do a graph and figure a percentage of how <br/>\nmany residents are for/against) and getting signatures on a petition, <br/>\ntalking and writing to council members, etc.  If I wanted to divide <br/>\nit into school subjects, I would say we have civics, language arts, <br/>\nand math.  However, I&#39;m not doing this project because I want to <br/>\ncover those subjects.  I&#39;m doing it because it&#39;s something that&#39;s <br/>\nimportant to my daughter.  None of it requires us to leave our town. <br/>\n   My boys are into trains.  We went (two hours) to Strasburg, PA to <br/>\nride on the real Thomas the tank engine.  We visited the railroad <br/>\nmuseum of PA.  We&#39;re going on a santa train ride, we&#39;re visiting <br/>\nthree other train museums.  They have every Thomas toy you could <br/>\nimagine.  We&#39;re touring an engine shed.  <br/>\n    I can see where life in general would be harder without a car.  <br/>\nBut that doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t follow their interests.  Wait <br/>\nuntil you see them really excited about something and go for it.  <br/>\nYou&#39;re right that a trip to the seashore would be better than a <br/>\nbook.  If they would really get into it, maybe you could find a way <br/>\nto earn the money together so that you could take a bus trip?  Maybe <br/>\nsell tupperware or baked goods or do a paper route together, and save <br/>\nall your profits in a jar?  <br/>\n    I can also relate to not having kids around with similar <br/>\ninterests to your kids.  My daughter really likes video games but <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really have any friends who are into them.  She gets to play <br/>\nvideo games with her dad, though, so it&#39;s special for them.  She <br/>\nloves American Girl dolls too, but has found a few friends who are <br/>\ninto them and who do that stuff with her.  American Girls are popular <br/>\namong girls in homeschool groups.  Do you have any homeschool groups <br/>\nnear you?  Where do you live?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\nmaybe that&#39;s why unschooling would be harder for me.last night the <br/>\ngirls & i were putting sea salt on each others feet & inside the jar <br/>\nwas a seashell & they wanted to know all about them,so i said we&#39;d <br/>\ngot to the library to get books on them,but if i could go to a beach <br/>\n& they could see seashells,i think they would learn much more than <br/>\nfrom a book.they are also interested in little house on the prairie <br/>\nbut we are far away from missouri or any other landmarks.i think <br/>\nseeing things in person would be much more educational & something <br/>\nthey would remember but all we can do is go to the library.my dream <br/>\nwould be to live on a small farm & my kids would help raise all the <br/>\nanimals & we&#39;d have a huge garden & also maybe make crafts to sell <br/>\nbut sadly it&#39;s only a dream.my girls are also interested in colonial <br/>\ntimes & we&#39;d love to have a party &quot;american girl&quot; style but we don&#39;t <br/>\nknow any girls since we moved up here 3 years ago.i don&#39;t have a way <br/>\nto get to any fascinating places.i guess if i had my own car & knew <br/>\nplaces near by of interest,i could probably do the unschooling thing <br/>\nquite well.are there any members here in my situation & if so how do <br/>\nyou unschool?especially with winter coming,i&#39;d like to know what you <br/>\nall do.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Renee :)  ...who&#39;s hoping to find her way to unschooling<br/>\n&gt;  Julie Stauffer &lt;jnjstau@g...&gt; wrote:&lt;&lt;do you make dinner a math <br/>\n </span></blockquote>project or what learning is going on&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi Renee,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You are about to engage in a wonderful journey and a major paradigm <br/>\n </span></blockquote>shift<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (at least if you are one of the lucky ones).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let me see if I can explain:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Adriane (11) wanted to raise dairy goats for 4-H.

He says<br/>\nhe <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to read it. So then I said to myself, &quot;I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nmake him read a book he doesn&#39;t want to read&quot;.  But he isn&#39;t really <br/>\ninterested in reading other books on his own either.  We go to the <br/>\nlibrary a lot and he checks out books on subjects that he is<br/>\ninterested <br/>\nin.  Like right now it is hockey.  But they are all adult books, he <br/>\njust looks at the pictures.  Which I think is great, but he has no <br/>\ninterest in learning to read them.
