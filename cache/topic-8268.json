It is true that you may not get<br/>\na lot af time for yourself, but you will probably get more than you think. I<br/>\nget mine before my kids get up in the morning. Others get it at night,<br/>\nnaptime, etc. Getting involved in a local group may get you time out too.<br/>\nBetween parents meetings, parents night out and games nights, etc. I get at<br/>\nleast 3 nights/month (almost 1/week) out. I also sell Pampered Chef and my<br/>\nkids are very good about giving me time to prep for a show if I just tell<br/>\nthem &quot;mommy&#39;s working now&quot;. I recently hired a mother&#39;s helper and she plays<br/>\nwith the kids while I do housework and i enjoy shutting my bedroom door,<br/>\nturning on the T.V. and just folding laundry or cleaning in peace. My<br/>\nhusband and I are going on our first &quot;date&quot; in 3 years tonight, because we<br/>\nfound a girl in our hs group that babysits. I&#39;m very excited.(Of course<br/>\nwe&#39;ll prob. talk about thekids all night-LOL) Boy, I get more time out than<br/>\nI thought&lt;g&gt;. Good luck.<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8261,"nextTopicId":8269}}
