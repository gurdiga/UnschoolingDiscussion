We just cleaned up the living room, and Gracie brought a puzzle in and sat down by the marker board which is leaning up against the wall because I haven&#39;t managed to hang it on the wall yet. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  It hit me that her puzzle pieces would probably be pretty darn cool with magnets on the back to play with on the board...so we stuck some on them - some animals...and VOILA! a &quot;new&quot; toy! :-) <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I just added magnets to a couple other puzzles, and Gracie asked me to put them on her Strawberry Shortcake letters and numbers puzzles as well so I&#39;m working on it. Thought I&#39;d take a moment to share...maybe someone else has little ones who would enjoy this. I bought the roll of magnets at Walmart in the craft section for less than $3, and it has a peel-off thing on the back so you can just stick it onto whatever. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Beth<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://serendipityacademy.blogspot.com\">http://serendipityacademy.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSing, Dance, Laugh...LOVE!<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
