To ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-465657321\">I know its the hardest thing for a parent to wait, but I never had a choice.  <br/>\nI have a strong-willed child, and that is one of his strongest assets.  To <br/>\ninterfere with his will to survive and to excell was going to bring about <br/>\nfailure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been waiting and waiting and waiting.  Sure, he could read some <br/>\nthings, and always asked about words.  This was of course when no one could <br/>\nhear it, as it was beyond the point of being socially acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when it comes to common sense and practicalities -- especially now when <br/>\nhe can read a lot more than before -- he is ahead of the others.  He comes <br/>\nout with, &quot;Mom, can&#39;t you read the directions?&quot; or &quot;Didn&#39;t you see what the <br/>\nsign said, 30 mph&quot;.  It&#39;s just that, rather than fooling around with nonsense <br/>\nfor years in school, he has just been dealing with what&#39;s important and what <br/>\nkeeps his interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was stunned this year when I asked him to describe what he had done <br/>\nyesterday on paper.  After he finished writing it (it was all phonetically <br/>\ncorrect but dictionarily there were some errors), he was stunned that I could <br/>\nread every word of it.  He wanted it corrected.<br/>\n<br/>\nI encourage you mothers to just let go, and let them develop.  Especially the <br/>\nboys.  They are so busy!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI should add that we have had to &quot;fake it&quot; lots of times --- with relatives <br/>\nand school authorities.  That is why I would rather remain anonymous, as we <br/>\nstill have a lot of stuff to get through until he is 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in the West.  Are very involved with ski racing, motorcross, BMX, RC <br/>\ncars and airplanes.  He has ski racing and bike racing sponsors who pay for <br/>\nalmost all of his costs.  My son works at construction making $10 per hour in <br/>\nthe summer.  He is a happy, well-balanced person.  Has tons of friends.  <br/>\nPeople stop by our house because of all the activity.  He loves to do stuff <br/>\non the internet.  Helps repair other people&#39;s computers.  Loves landscaping. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis fall we set up snowmaking in our yard with garden hoses, and then made <br/>\njumps from a ramp off of the roof.  Then we looked up on the internet and <br/>\nfound a fantastic site about snowmaking and physics.  His comment:  &quot;If I had <br/>\nonly known this years ago.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve me!!!  I have gone through all the fears.  Unschooling really <br/>\nworks!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nMiss Wally</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39553,"nextTopicId":39495}}
