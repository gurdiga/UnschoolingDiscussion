As Quakers, as a religious matter we<br/>\ndon&#39;t celebrate any holidays (or, more accurately, all days are holidays<br/>\nas they hold equal promise for revealing the divine to us); as a<br/>\ncultural matter, we are free to do as we choose.  We are very conscious,<br/>\nhowever, of how important Christmas is to the people around us, and we<br/>\ntry hard to honor that.  For several years now, my wife has taken my<br/>\ndaughter (a violinist) to the local hospital on Christmas Day where she<br/>\n(daughter) goes from room to room playing carols for kids who can&#39;t get<br/>\nhome for Christmas and their families.  My younger one (a pianist) goes<br/>\nto the local nursing home to play.Prior to holiday, they usually set up<br/>\nshop outside the local supermarket and play and collect money for the<br/>\nlocal homeless shelter at which we all volunteer.  The day after<br/>\nChristmas we have a family tradition of heading to Seattle to a<br/>\nUnitarian church which has the largest Handel&#39;s Messiah Sing-and-Play-In<br/>\nin western Washington.  (when we lived in coastal California, the day<br/>\nafter Christmas was a day to go visit the elephant seals, and celebrate<br/>\nthe natural world around us.)<br/>\n<br/>\n We also celebrate Chanukah -- but with the militarist story removed --<br/>\nrather as a celebration of light in the darkness, hope in hard times. We<br/>\ndo it up with lights, potato pancakes, and the whole bit.  We also<br/>\ncelebrate Diwali -- the Hindu festival of lights -- commemorating the<br/>\nvictory of good over evil.  My kids developed a puppet show to go with<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that lack of strong religious belief in your case, or<br/>\nobjection to adult myths foisted upon children in mine, has to take away<br/>\nfrom the opportunity of celebrating who we are as a family, or as part<br/>\nof a larger community.
