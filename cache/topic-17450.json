There&#39;s a <br/>\n$550 dollar tuition, but \u000f<br/>\nif you have no alternatives or like the support it&#39;s <br/>\nwell worth it and, hey, \u000f<br/>\nit&#39;s cheaper than private school!\u000f<br/>\nI can&#39;t think of another way you could do it within the law, because it&#39;s \u000f<br/>\nawfully strict, but I&#39;m sure the others have some good <br/>\nideas.\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\nHope this helps.\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\nGood luck!\u000f<br/>\nErin Mills\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\nwww.goddessmoon.org have an &#39;umbrella school&#39; set up, I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re &#39;authorised&#39; (or whatever the <br/>\ncorrect term is) by NY.

You have to work on their schedule, submit <br/>\na plan, take tests. They even specify exactly what &quot;needs&quot; to be studied in <br/>\neach grade! If by not registering with the school district you mean not <br/>\nsubmitting a &quot;declaration of intent to utilize a homestudy program&quot;, then <br/>\nyes that is illegal. However, there are homeschooling families who do that <br/>\nand you probably could and get away with it but..... If you think they would <br/>\nnotice or if the idea just strikes fear into your heart you might like to <br/>\nlook into Clonlara School&#39;s Home-based Education Program (www.clonlara.org). <br/>\nClonlara&#39;s a nationally accredited private campus school and if you register <br/>\nwith them you are officially considered a private school student by The <br/>\nSystem,and Clonlara takes care of everything. And they don&#39;t force a <br/>\nparticular curriculum or even a structured school like system on you. You do <br/>\nyour thing, Clonlara gives credit for it. There&#39;s a $550 dollar tuition, but <br/>\nif you have no alternatives or like the support it&#39;s well worth it and, hey, <br/>\nit&#39;s cheaper than private school!<br/>\nI can&#39;t think of another way you could do it within the law, because it&#39;s <br/>\nawfully strict, but I&#39;m sure the others have some good ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nErin Mills<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"willie13339@yahoo.com","from":"willie13339@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"M4v9QxHEKIu7Q4LgW1EzvDncjunDoRMUCZE1mWKqk932yP4kCMqF4KfvXHVpadsyvOmWql2a3nNThzsA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"from bookwork to no work?","postDate":"985908750","msgId":17450,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlhMGdtZSttbTJkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":17471,"prevInTime":17449,"nextInTime":17451,"topicId":17450,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone,my name is Renee and I homeschool my 8 yob.
