Some may even be inherited.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids were adopted and none of them are biologically related.  However, I<br/>\nknow their birthfamilies (even had siblings live with us at times) and the<br/>\nkids&#39; &quot;responsibility levels&quot; tend to be closer to their birth siblings than<br/>\nto their adoptive siblings.  Let me say that all the kids have lived with us<br/>\nsince they were newborns.  We are the only family they have ever known.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdriane is  &quot;Miss Responsibility&quot;.  Her room is clean, her animals cared<br/>\nfor, used her allowance to start a savings account to save for a trailer for<br/>\nher 4-H project, when considering having her ears pierced she talked with<br/>\nabout 20 people to get their experiences, talked to the people who do the<br/>\npiercing and paid for it herself.  She has rarely done anything we have<br/>\nasked her not to.  Her birthmother is much the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\nZach is &quot;Wild Man&quot;.  His room is raunchy, money burns a hole in his pocket,<br/>\nhe breaks or loses most things he comes in contact with.  His birthfather is<br/>\nmuch the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarsie is &quot;Everybody&#39;s Best Friend&quot;.  She has never met a stranger, would<br/>\nthink nothing of getting in the car with someone she didn&#39;t know, makes<br/>\nfriends everywhere she goes, has no problem &quot;mooching&quot; off acquaintances,<br/>\ndismantles everything she plays with whether it is hers or not.  Her<br/>\nbirthsister lived with us for 8 months prior to Marsie being born and the<br/>\ngirls are very similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nDanny is &quot;Mr. Destructo&quot;.  He lives his life at full speed, is heedless of<br/>\nany dangers even after being pointedly warned about them, he runs off,<br/>\nconstantly explores and climbs, has big falling in the floor fits whenever<br/>\nany little thing doesn&#39;t happen the way he wants.  He is a carbon copy of<br/>\nhis brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle I don&#39;t know about because I have little contact with her<br/>\nbirthfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll my kids have had the same behavior modeled for them, the same<br/>\nexplanations, the same cautions about things......very different results.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38568,"nextTopicId":38575}}
