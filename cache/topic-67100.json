If I taught &quot;with&quot; those degrees, the kids would be bored stupid (pun??).  Idolizing degreed people is a crock of s**t.  I see it in business too.  &quot;Oh, you must be smart, you have a degree.  Gush, gush.&quot;  Actually my degree is testament to the fact that I can get up and go to class (hard one that), put up with and memorize the prof&#39;s opinions (able to suppress gag reflex), repeat them on a test and fund the whole thing with summer jobs and loans.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo find a smart person, look for people who challenge the status quo.  They think, rather than follow!  They love and learn, rather than watch TV 55 hours/week.<br/>\n<br/>\nTim Thomas<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, May 01, 2003 5:44 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] something nagging<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 5/1/2003 7:11:05 AM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mabeitzel@...\">mabeitzel@...</a> writes:<br/>\n  &gt; She had a neighbor get quite absurd <br/>\n  &gt; with her when she found out that she had pulled her son out of <br/>\n  &gt; school and made the comment that &quot;That should not be allowed...only <br/>\n  &gt; people with college degrees should be allowed to teach children.&quot;  <br/>\n  &gt; Now I was not there, so I cannot say word for word what happened or <br/>\n  &gt; how it was perceived, but how would you respond?
