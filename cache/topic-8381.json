I too have a 3yob, and he just had conjunctivitis, and <br/>\nwe had to go through the whole thing with the drops too. Argh!<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I would just squeeze a few drops on there without even warning him <br/>\nabout it. I always do all this on the changing table so I keep the drops <br/>\nhandy and just do it before changing a diaper.<br/>\n<br/>\nThree-year-olds want to be in control of themselves so I have found that <br/>\nother times it helps to offer limited options. I would say, &#39;Point to the <br/>\neye you want the drops in first. Did I get it in there? Should I put more <br/>\nhere? Would you like to try squeezing the bottle yourself?&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that you actually don&#39;t need to get much of the liquid into the eye <br/>\nfor it to work. The general vicinity of the eyelid is good. Also, I often <br/>\nused probably six or eight drops to get one close enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think it is important to treat conjunctivitis because besides being <br/>\nreally uncomfortable, it is quite contagious. Whenever one of mine gets it, <br/>\nI do too. So far, I have managed to keep it from spreading between the kids <br/>\nwith stringent hand-washing and treating ASAP. I guess I catch  it from the <br/>\nsnuggles, can&#39;t help myself...<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8389,"nextTopicId":8391}}
