The 13 year old girl sat down by my<br/>\nhusband last night while he was gaming and told him that I was her closest<br/>\nfriend.  She talks to me and I answer her questions. I think she needs that<br/>\nso I want to handle this in a way that won&#39;t make her parents feel like they<br/>\nhave to keep their kids away from our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think they are allowed here because my husband and I came out of a very<br/>\nreligious background.  Many years ago we were both very involved in church.<br/>\nWe also worked together in christian radio and in a christian bookstore.  We<br/>\ngot burned (multiple times) and neither of us wants a repeat performance,<br/>\nnor do we want to see our kids go through that crap.  However, we know how<br/>\nto &quot;talk&quot; and &quot;act&quot; around those people so I think they are assuming we have<br/>\nnot found the &quot;right&quot; church or something.  They will figure it out soon<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir youngest daughter (11) was giving my son the &quot;you need to be saved&quot;<br/>\nroutine yesterday.  I heard him say &quot;what&#39;s sin?&quot; from the other room and I<br/>\nquickly found something to do closer to them so I could hear what was going<br/>\non.  I am sure she is doing this because they are baptist and that is what<br/>\nthey are taught to do.  If you don&#39;t save your friends they are going to<br/>\nburn in hell.  Nice way to scare kids if you ask me and somewhat warped to<br/>\nhave them always fearing for their friends.  I know because I was raised the<br/>\nsame way.  It is what is making her so pushy about it, I think, so I am<br/>\ntrying to be kind about it all.  Really though, inside I am seething about<br/>\nthe whole situation....probably because it hits such a raw nerve with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she finished with her &quot;presentation&quot; I explained to C that that is what<br/>\nChristians believe.  He has been exposed to it before along with the basics<br/>\nof other religions.  There are many different beliefs held by friends and<br/>\nother family members which he is beginning to notice.  He looked relieved<br/>\nand just said &quot;well, I am not Christian.&quot;  She looked horrified as I then<br/>\nsaid &quot;that&#39;s ok, you don&#39;t have to be if that&#39;s not what you want.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the parents are still letting them come over and are still talking<br/>\nto us because we are their pet project.  It would be a big deal if they<br/>\ncould &quot;get us back into the fold.&quot;  My husband also used to be a youth<br/>\nminister.  When they found out about that I felt like the vultures were<br/>\ncircling again.  Oh the ways they could use us.....I can see the glint in<br/>\ntheir eyes. &lt;sigh&gt;  I hate feeling so cynical but I have been through this<br/>\nway too many times to do it again.
