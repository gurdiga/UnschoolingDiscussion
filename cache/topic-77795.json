An &quot;omnibus&quot; bill such as this one takes awhile to sort out <br/>\nand comprehend.  H.R. 2732 proposes amending a number of different <br/>\nlaws, and I have been digging into discussions that explore various <br/>\naspects and ramifications of this bill. Here is some &quot;in the news&quot; <br/>\ninfo to get you started on your own research.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bill begins:  &quot;108th Congress, 1st Session, H.R. 2732, to amend <br/>\nselected statutes to clarify existing Federal law as to the treatment <br/>\nof students privately educated at home under State law.&quot;  Read it in <br/>\nits entirety at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_bills&docid=f:h2732ih.txt.pdf108th\">http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_bills&docid=f:h2732ih.txt.pdf108th</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nFamily News in Focus, By David Brody, July 16<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://family.org/cforum/fnif/news/a0026905.cfm\">http://family.org/cforum/fnif/news/a0026905.cfm</a><br/>\nHeadline:  Home-Schooling Protection Bill Introduced<br/>\n&quot;Chris Klicka and his group - the Home School Legal Defense <br/>\nAssociation - wrote the bill... The bill has a chance of passage. It <br/>\nhas the support of House Education and Workforce Committee Chairman <br/>\nJohn Boehner, which should ensure it has life through the legislative <br/>\nprocess. Supporters say even if the whole bill doesn&#39;t pass, they <br/>\nplan to attach certain parts of it to different education bills to <br/>\nmove their agenda forward.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn:  Not all homeschoolers believe this bill is a good one. On July <br/>\n28, Helen Hegener posted her position on the HEM-Networking list. <br/>\nHere is a small quote: &quot;But there&#39;s an even larger question to ask, <br/>\nand that is: Why the move to strengthen the power of the federal <br/>\ngovernment over what has always been a state concern? <br/>\nConstitutionally, education is the province of the states, and bills <br/>\nlike this one force a conflict between the federal government and <br/>\nstate governments.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you&#39;ve done your research, here is help in expressing your opinion.<br/>\n&quot;How to Lobby Congress: A Workbook for Citizen Organizations&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.citizenlobbyist.com/index.html\">http://www.citizenlobbyist.com/index.html</a><br/>\n&quot;We... can help you, the average person with no contacts, make your <br/>\nway through Washington&#39;s corridors of power and turn your ideas into <br/>\nlaw, all without having to pay high priced Lobbyists and without <br/>\nhaving to travel to D.C.&quot;<br/>\nDownload the free workbook (31 pages), &quot;How to Lobby Congress: A <br/>\nWorkbook for Citizen Organizations&quot; at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.citizenlobbyist.com/download/\">http://www.citizenlobbyist.com/download/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n*** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***<br/>\n<br/>\nTo read the rest of this NewsComm issue, click here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/whts_nw.html\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/whts_nw.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHEM News & Commentary is a weekly report on what&#39;s happening in the <br/>\nworld of homeschooling.
