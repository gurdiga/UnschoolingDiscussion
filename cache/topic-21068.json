","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2111715306\">Your son sounds like mine in many ways.  We got quite<br/>\na bit of help from our chiropractor, who is also a<br/>\nnutritionist, homeopathist, ND who uses kinesiology. <br/>\nThe biggest help she gave us was telling us what foods<br/>\nhe was sensitive to... eliminating corn (corn starch<br/>\nand syrup was the most difficult to do), dairy, and<br/>\nwheat did him a lot of good... eliminated the constant<br/>\near infections and helped him with impulse control a<br/>\ngreat deal.  Bach flower essences have helped a bit on<br/>\noccasion, as has homeopathy, but I&#39;d say the food<br/>\nelimination was the most significant thing.  It didn&#39;t<br/>\nsolve the problems completely, but it sure kept the<br/>\nfamily sane, and helped my son considerably.  The<br/>\nother thing we did was use the book &#39;Holding Time&#39;<br/>\nwhen our son was two... if you can use it now, I&#39;d<br/>\nhighly recommend it.  It was really hard on us,<br/>\nbecause our son was *extremely* touch aversive, so he<br/>\nnever relaxed into it the way they describe, but we<br/>\nsaw *huge* improvements after two weeks of treatment. <br/>\nAfter a couple months we stopped using it regularly,<br/>\nand only used it when he seemed to spiral out of<br/>\ncontrol of himself, it really seemed to help him get<br/>\ngrounded and centered.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the hard thing, but invaluable, I think... to<br/>\nhelp your son learn to recognize his own feelings of<br/>\nstress and &#39;spiralling&#39; and to do what he needs to do<br/>\nto break the pattern and center himself.  I found that<br/>\nmy son was generally lashing out physically when he<br/>\nwas overwhelmed in terms of stress/stimuli, so helping<br/>\nhim eliminate the stimuli for a bit was helpful.  I<br/>\nfound it helpful to make his room very zenlike... not<br/>\na lot of stuff, nothing on the walls... kids like this<br/>\nare often very open to the world, they don&#39;t have the<br/>\nsame ability to filter out what is extraneous and what<br/>\nis important.  We sort of prioritize what is of<br/>\nimport, ignore the peripheral stuff and focus on what<br/>\nis useful to the situation; for these kids it&#39;s all<br/>\nthe same, everything is important, which is *so*<br/>\noverwhelming.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Ritalin is not necessary in a lot of cases, I<br/>\nthink some parents find it extremely helpful.  You<br/>\nneed to assess your own situation, and your child&#39;s,<br/>\nand be flexible, try different things.  DON&#39;T worry<br/>\nabout him doing what other kids are doing at the same<br/>\nage... they aren&#39;t dealing with the same stuff he is,<br/>\nso it isn&#39;t a fair comparison.  Be aware of where his<br/>\nown strengths and gifts lie, and praise him for those;<br/>\nthe rest of the world is hard on his self esteem, so<br/>\nshore up what you can at home.  He isn&#39;t sensitive to<br/>\nothers because he is so overwhelmed by his own senses;<br/>\nhe is actually more sensitive than most other<br/>\nchildren.  If he can learn to control that to some<br/>\ndegree, that can be a gift as well as a burden.<br/>\n<br/>\nEileen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Nanci Kuykendall &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aisliin@...\">aisliin@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Right now we are agonizing over what to do to help<br/>\n&gt; our<br/>\n&gt; son, and the rest of the family, function on a daily<br/>\n&gt; basis.

It worries me, and makes me angry with<br/>\nmyself.  But I came from an alcoholic and abusive home<br/>\nand the fact that I left my ex and married my husband<br/>\nat all are miracles I think.  I left him when I was 2<br/>\nmonths pregnant and the realities of trying to parent<br/>\na child with him, or even near him, hit me in the<br/>\nface.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I had been coworkers for over 2 years<br/>\nat that point and he was recently (less than a year)<br/>\ndivorced from his chemically dependent, abusive ex. <br/>\nWe just sort of fell into each other and were married<br/>\na few months later.  He did birthing classes with me<br/>\nand was my coach and everything.  He was very excited<br/>\nand very ready to parent.  We decided to put his name<br/>\non the birth certificate, since my ex told me numerous<br/>\ntimes to &quot;get rid of it&quot; with regards to the baby.  My<br/>\nhusbands name is Thomas and it was his idea to name<br/>\nour eldest after his side of the family (5 Toms in a<br/>\ndirect line).  He is a wonderful father, and I am<br/>\nextremely lucky.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It seems that he has one thing under control that is<br/>\n&gt;usually something that has to be taught--going to a<br/>\n&gt;quiet/safe space (his room) to desensitize and<br/>\n&gt;then coming back to the rest of the family.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes this is something we taught him early on, and<br/>\nrecently in the last 6 months, he has begun to self<br/>\nimplement it and not have to be told when it is time<br/>\nfor some quiet time.  He will say, &quot;I&#39;m just goin&#39; to<br/>\nmy room!&quot;  and we will say &quot;Good Idea!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;One thing that struck me that you said &quot;at the level<br/>\n&gt;we are expecting him to&quot; is something we told parents<br/>\n&gt;to throw out the window.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I meant by that was behavior wise and not<br/>\nacademics or anything.  We put no pressure on him to<br/>\nperform anything along the &quot;schoolish&quot; lines of<br/>\ncourse.  But I see what you mean as applied to<br/>\nbehavior.  I do not however, think that his<br/>\nexpectations are unreasonable for his particular case.<br/>\n His expectations are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1 - to ask politely for things and not demand or<br/>\norder.  When he does we simply give him the arched<br/>\nbrow look, or say &quot;excuse me?&quot; or &quot;Could you ask that<br/>\nagain?&quot;  He knows the drill and responds &quot;May I<br/>\nplease...bla bla&quot;  rather than Gimmee!<br/>\n<br/>\n2 - Do not express your displeasure by screaming at or<br/>\nhurting anyone in the family.  If he does, he is asked<br/>\nto please go to his room until he is ready to be<br/>\naround other people again. <br/>\n<br/>\n3 - The potty thing.  He knows when he has to go, he<br/>\nhas absolute control that I have seen him display on<br/>\nnumerous occassions.  He is just resistant, and/or<br/>\nlacks the impulse control and attention span to stop<br/>\nwhat he is doing to go to the bathroom.  He was going<br/>\nfrom standing at the bathroom door, clear upstairs to<br/>\nhis room to pee his pants and hide them at one point.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis week I have implemented a new strategy.  I set a<br/>\ntimer and every 15 to 20 minutes (I swear he has the<br/>\nbladder capacity of a mouse) I remind him to go to the<br/>\nbathroom, not optional.  He pees every single time,<br/>\nand it prevents the &quot;accidents&quot; that we were having<br/>\ncompletely.  He likes me to make a big fuss over him<br/>\nwhen he goes, so I do.  He is feeling great about<br/>\nhimself and being able to go a whole day with dry<br/>\npants.  Now we just have to get over his resistance to<br/>\npooping in the potty, which he has yet to do.  He says<br/>\nhe is scared.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a lot for all the encouragement though, Lynda. <br/>\nI do appreciate it.  I am thinking that this is more<br/>\nchemical related than diet related.  As his diet<br/>\ncycles through various likes and passions and there<br/>\nseems to be no appreciable difference in his behavior<br/>\nwhen he is focused on a very small menu for a while,<br/>\nor when he chages gears and moves on to something<br/>\nelse.  He really loves baked beans though.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I suggested maybe he should<br/>\n&gt; get on his trike and put his things in the bag on the<br/>\n&gt; hadlebars so that he could steer, as he was trying to<br/>\n&gt; push it from behind, with poor results.
