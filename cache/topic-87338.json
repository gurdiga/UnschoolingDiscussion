They&#39;re not<br/>\ndesigned to do anything but prove that the kids scanned the whole room, and <br/>\nthey DO<br/>\nscan. They end up ignoring important and interesting things just to find<br/>\ntheir answers. Just like answering the questions at the end of a chapter, <br/>\nonly<br/>\nworse.

When they had rushed on out of <br/>\nthe building a few minutes later Patrick noted &quot;Mom, they didn&#39;t look at <br/>\nANYTHING if it wasn&#39;t on their sheets.

We <br/>\nplanned the whole things out, complete with exotic ingredients, and headed out.  We <br/>\nmust have wandered that store for hours, buying lucky bamboo and engraved <br/>\nporcelain chopsticks along with all of our eventually found ingredients...then we <br/>\ncame home and had a blast cooking it and presenting it as traditionally as we <br/>\ncould.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wonton fell apart in the broth and the rice cakes were tough, but we sure <br/>\ndid have a good time. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of ways of engaging the mind without resorting to schoolish <br/>\nactivities.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87333,"nextTopicId":87351}}
