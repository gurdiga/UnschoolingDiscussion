If something goes wrong, then you are a bad parent <br/>\nand you will be charged. If nothing goes wrong, you won&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n- RICHARD WEXLER, director a children&#39;s advocacy group, who has compiled<br/>\nresearch on children left home alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/19/nyregion/19MOTH.html?th\">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/19/nyregion/19MOTH.html?th</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the story: <br/>\n       . . .The Child Trends researchers found that higher-income children <br/>\nbetween 6 and 9 were actually more likely than poor children to be left <br/>\nunsupervised for several hours, even after controlling for the fact that the <br/>\nbetter-off parents were more likely to have jobs. <br/>\n<br/>\n       The authors of the report, &quot;Left Unsupervised: A Look at the Most <br/>\nVulnerable Children,&quot; warned that leaving children under 13 routinely on their own <br/>\nmay put them at risk for injuries and developmental problems. But they also <br/>\nhedged, writing: &quot;Self care is not always harmful. Children typically become <br/>\nmore independent as they mature, gradually spending more and more time alone and <br/>\ntaking increasing amounts of responsibility.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n       When unsupervised children become notorious, the legal system may feel <br/>\n<br/>\nextra pressure to hold parents accountable, even when the case did not end in <br/>\ntragedy. . .Yet in other strikingly similar cases, parents were not <br/>\nprosecuted. . . <br/>\n<br/>\n       Professor Lareau said that among the well-off families she followed <br/>\nfor her new book, &quot;Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race and Family Life (University <br/>\nof California Press, 2003), were a pair on an out-of-town trip to a soccer <br/>\nchampionship who left two 10-year-olds, two 8-year-olds and a 5-year-old alone in <br/>\na hotel room while the two sets of parents went out to dinner a mile away.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n       They left the kids with cell phones, pizzas and videos saying to each <br/>\nother, `They&#39;ll turn us in,&#39; &quot; she recalled. The children did not turn them <br/>\nin, however, and no fire broke out. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83030,"nextTopicId":83078}}
