As a young, recently divorced mother I had a infant to care <br/>\nfor that battled numerous illnesses (bronchities, chronic ear infections, <br/>\nasthma).  Even with the coverage we had the copays and deductibles nearly <br/>\nbroke me financially.  I thanked God every day that I had a very supportive <br/>\nmother that didn&#39;t mind helping out financially.  At times I know the burden <br/>\nwas almost too much for her to bear.  Here I am now, nearly 10 years later, <br/>\nin the same boat.  We pay over $400 a month for medical coverage that really <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t cover much.  Our copays are astronomical on top of this huge monthly <br/>\nburden.  Getting decent care in this state seems to be too much to ask as <br/>\nwell.  Though my son outgrew most of the ailments that burdened us earlier - <br/>\nnow we have a whole new set of ailments that are frowned upon severely in <br/>\nthis medical community - mental health issues.  How quaint that our copay <br/>\nincrease only affected mental health prescriptions that don&#39;t happen to have <br/>\na generic version available.  Sorry to get on such a soap box, but this issue <br/>\nis so near and dear to my heart and my every day life.  I truly believe there <br/>\nhas to be a better solution for available health care for all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSheri</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4158,"nextTopicId":4164}}
