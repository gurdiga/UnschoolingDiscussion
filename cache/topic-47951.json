I&#39;m so much more patient now then <br/>\nwhen I was younger. (or is it that I&#39;m just slower?!) I don&#39;t even send <br/>\nanyone to their rooms or anything. I&#39;ll usually suggest a calming down <br/>\nperiod if I see things are heating up. It&#39;s usually between my 6 and 7 year <br/>\nolds. When I suggest that we all take a minute to breath and calm down, one <br/>\nof them will actually get up and leae and go somewher else. Luckily we have <br/>\nplenty of other places for one to go around here. The one that stays is <br/>\nusually the one I can talk to first about what happened and how did they <br/>\nfeel and how do you think the other one felt and what could we do different <br/>\nif it happens again. Then when that&#39;s settled, I go and see the other one, <br/>\nwho by now I can talk to. Usually that&#39;s my son but not always. That&#39;s <br/>\npretty much how we work everything out. Not always does one leave either. <br/>\nThey are getting more and more use staying and working it out and I even <br/>\nhear them both at different times working it out together before anything <br/>\nstarts. How nice is that???<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m working on getting my husband to understand. He&#39;s really good with <br/>\nthe kids but sometimes he doesn&#39;t think right away and raises his voice, <br/>\nwhich causes the kids to ask if he&#39;s mad at them. That&#39;s a good reminder for <br/>\nhim then to go a different route. He definitely doesn&#39;t want them to think <br/>\nhe&#39;s mad at them for whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one of the children takes a tone maybe that isn&#39;t sounding so nice, I <br/>\nwill ask them to stop a minute and think if that&#39;s the way they really want <br/>\nto put it. I haven&#39;t ever had any of them in the past couple of years say <br/>\nyes and continue being as some might call sassy. I say past couple of years <br/>\nbecause I have a 16 year old who we didn&#39;t nurture the same way and well, 12 <br/>\nand 13 were tough years. 14 and 15 were better and now we&#39;re great!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI just look at what would work for me and someone saying is that what you <br/>\nreally meant or why are you saying it like that would cause me to stop and <br/>\nlisten. It works with the kids too. At the same time, they are very much <br/>\nable to express anger to me or my husband and have that be fine. It&#39;s just a <br/>\nmatter of caring about the other person at the same time you&#39;re mad at them!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBroadband?�Dial-up?
