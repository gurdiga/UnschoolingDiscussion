I would <br/>\njust make sure she knows the commitment (depending on her age she may already <br/>\nknow).  Sounds like a great opportunity and an interest of hers.<br/>\n<br/>\nA side example: I have a sister with a little girl who is now 11. She has a <br/>\nvoice that puts many professional singers to the bench. She has always wanted <br/>\nto do try outs and auditions. She has made several tapes. The kid can sing <br/>\nbeautifully. The problem is my sister doesn&#39;t wont to be bothered with the <br/>\ncommitment but also knows she will be successful and wants her to wait a few years to <br/>\nget her schooling down.  When I call often times her DH is on line looking up <br/>\naudition dates and information but never tells her Mom she wants to go to one <br/>\noften enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an extreme situation as Unschoolers listen much more than PS parents <br/>\nbut sometimes they just dont show their dreams enough for the parents to see <br/>\nhow big.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she does make it you will have the joys of a child and maybe a tape to <br/>\nremember for both of your lives. She will always remember the goods and the bad-s <br/>\nof making it. Memories of Mom supporting her rather than saying no with fair <br/>\nmuch better for years to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n&lt;&lt;The Problem???<br/>\nLast night she was so nervous about &quot;failing&quot; she was crying at almost <br/>\nmidnight!<br/>\nShe says she wants to get called back.

She was very sad...for awhile, but, I thought, okay.<br/>\nThis past week, she received an e-mail for auditions for &quot;Christmas Carol&quot; <br/>\nHer audition is for 1:45 this afternoon.<br/>\nShe has to sing - she&#39;s okay w/ that - while she hasn&#39;t had lessons, she has a very pleasing voice and can sing rather well.<br/>\nShe has to tell a joke - she&#39;s okay with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Problem???<br/>\nLast night she was so nervous about &quot;failing&quot; she was crying at almost midnight!<br/>\nShe says she wants to get called back.
