Forty percent of students lack basic reading <br/>\nskills, and their academic performance is dismal compared with that <br/>\nof their foreign counterparts. In response to this crisis, schools <br/>\nare skilling-and-drilling their way &quot;back to basics,&quot; moving toward <br/>\nmechanical instruction methods that rely on line-by-line scripting <br/>\nfor teachers and endless multiple-choice testing. Consequently, kids <br/>\naren&#39;t learning how to think anymore - they&#39;re learning how to <br/>\nmemorize. This might be an ideal recipe for the future Babbitts of <br/>\nthe world, but it won&#39;t produce the kind of agile, analytical minds <br/>\nthat will lead the high tech global age. Fortunately, we&#39;ve got Grand <br/>\nTheft Auto: Vice City and Deus X for that. <br/>\n  <br/>\nAfter school, kids are devouring new information, concepts, and <br/>\nskills every day, and, like it or not, they&#39;re doing it controller in <br/>\nhand, plastered to the TV. The fact is, when kids play videogames <br/>\nthey can experience a much more powerful form of learning than when <br/>\nthey&#39;re in the classroom. Learning isn&#39;t about memorizing isolated <br/>\nfacts. It&#39;s about connecting and manipulating them. Doubt it? Just <br/>\nask anyone who&#39;s beaten Legend of Zelda or solved Morrowind. <br/>\n  <br/>\nThe phenomenon of the videogame as an agent of mental training is <br/>\nlargely unstudied; more often, games are denigrated for being violent <br/>\nor they&#39;re just plain ignored. They shouldn&#39;t be. Young gamers today <br/>\naren&#39;t training to be gun-toting carjackers. They&#39;re learning how to <br/>\nlearn. In Pikmin, children manage an army of plantlike aliens and <br/>\nstrategize to solve problems. In Metal Gear Solid 2, players move <br/>\nstealthily through virtual environments and carry out intricate <br/>\nmissions. Even in the notorious Vice City, players craft a persona, <br/>\nbuild a history, and shape a virtual world. In strategy games like <br/>\nWarCraft III and Age of Mythology, they learn to micromanage an array <br/>\nof elements while simultaneously balancing short- and long-term <br/>\ngoals. That sounds like something for their résumés. <br/>\n  <br/>\nThe secret of a videogame as a teaching machine isn&#39;t its immersive 3-<br/>\nD graphics, but its underlying architecture. Each level dances around <br/>\nthe outer limits of the player&#39;s abilities, seeking at every point to <br/>\nbe hard enough to be just doable. In cognitive science, this is <br/>\nreferred to as the regime of competence principle, which results in a <br/>\nfeeling of simultaneous pleasure and frustration - a sensation as <br/>\nfamiliar to gamers as sore thumbs. Cognitive scientist Andy diSessa <br/>\nhas argued that the best instruction hovers at the boundary of a <br/>\nstudent&#39;s competence. Most schools, however, seek to avoid invoking <br/>\nfeelings of both pleasure and frustration, blind to the fact that <br/>\nthese emotions can be extremely useful when it comes to teaching <br/>\nkids. <br/>\n  <br/>\nAlso, good videogames incorporate the principle of expertise. They <br/>\ntend to encourage players to achieve total mastery of one level, only <br/>\nto challenge and undo that mastery in the next, forcing kids to adapt <br/>\nand evolve. This carefully choreographed dialectic has been <br/>\nidentified by learning theorists as the best way to achieve expertise <br/>\nin any field. This doesn&#39;t happen much in our routine-driven schools, <br/>\nwhere &quot;good&quot; students are often just good at &quot;doing school.&quot; <br/>\n  <br/>\nHow did videogames become such successful models of effective <br/>\nlearning? Game coders aren&#39;t trained as cognitive scientists. It&#39;s a <br/>\nsimple case of free-market economics: If a title doesn&#39;t teach <br/>\nplayers how to play it well, it won&#39;t sell well. Game companies don&#39;t <br/>\nrake in $6.9 billion a year by dumbing down the material - <br/>\naficionados condemn short and easy games like Half Life: Blue Shift <br/>\nand Devil May Cry 2. Designers respond by making harder and more <br/>\ncomplex games that require mastery of sophisticated worlds and as <br/>\nmany as 50 to 100 hours to complete. Schools, meanwhile, respond with <br/>\nmore tests, more drills, and more rigidity. They&#39;re in the cognitive-<br/>\nscience dark ages. <br/>\n  <br/>\nWe don&#39;t often think about videogames as relevant to education <br/>\nreform, but maybe we should. Game designers don&#39;t often think of <br/>\nthemselves as learning theorists. Maybe they should. Kids often say <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t feel like learning when they&#39;re gaming - they&#39;re much too <br/>\nfocused on playing. If kids were to say that about a science lesson, <br/>\nour country&#39;s education problems would be solved. <br/>\n  <br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n---------- <br/>\n  <br/>\nJames Paul Gee, a reading professor at the University of Wisconsin-<br/>\nMadison, is the author of &#39;What Video Games Have to Teach Us About <br/>\nLearning and Literacy&#39;. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/view.html?pg=1\">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/view.html?pg=1</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66299,"nextTopicId":66386}}
