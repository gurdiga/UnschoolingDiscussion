One <br/>\nnight I didn&#39;t see Kirby at all, and I had forgotten I had an early morning  <br/>\nappointment with Marty at the orthodontist.  On the way home I remembered  Kirby <br/>\nhad a 9:00 a.m. meeting and I had forgotten all about reminding him and I  <br/>\nfelt a moment of panic, but when we got nearer the house, I saw his van was  gone.<br/>\n <br/>\nMarty&#39;s alarm clock just went off.  It&#39;s 9:50 and he&#39;s supposed to be  at <br/>\nwork at 11:00.  I thought &quot;how nice&quot; and kept typing here, but it didn&#39;t  stop.  <br/>\nI had to turn it off, because he&#39;s already upstairs, having woken up  before <br/>\nthe alarm.  He just started the shower.<br/>\n <br/>\nHOW COOL IS THAT!?  He&#39;s 16 and would have done what he&#39;s doing  whether I <br/>\nwas home or not, whether I was asleep or not.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"Heidi Crane","from":"&quot;Heidi Crane&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE:curious question about when unschoolers grow up","postDate":"1112886540","msgId":105220,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEwMi1GMTdEMTQ2NkY0OURENkJFOEYyOUVDREMwM0UwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMTI4NzQ3NTMuNTU0LjE0NDI3Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":105223,"prevInTime":105219,"nextInTime":105221,"topicId":105220,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is ringing true in our family, in the area of bedtimes.

I let it go a <br/>\ncouple of years ago, and my kids all go to bed quite late. One, ehem, quite <br/>\nEARLY ;) But!!! What the kids really want to do, even if they have to get up <br/>\nearly, they do. This tells me that, when it is important to them, they are <br/>\ncapable of rising and shining (or tidying up, or being on time, or saving <br/>\nmoney, etc.) I don&#39;t have to give them sheets of paperwork and make sure <br/>\nit&#39;s in on time; when they NEED to be on time, they will BE on time.
