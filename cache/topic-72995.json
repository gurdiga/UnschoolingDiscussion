But through way of children who went to college, who <br/>\nmoved out and those who still live at home, they are here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are not &quot;mine&quot; but they are MINE.  Just in this year, my youngest son, <br/>\noldest child at home called me on my way home from out to town to &quot;break the <br/>\nnews&quot;.  The puppy was here, the puppy was staying.

I <br/>\nguess I could just ship the dog off to the pound or something but I just <br/>\ncan&#39;t.  My son LOVES the dog, he&#39;s busy.  I knew he would be busy.  He does take <br/>\nher with him when he can and if I remind him she might like to go.  I feed her, <br/>\nI play with her, I let her out, I sleep with her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t want her, she loves me, I love her, has it only been three and a <br/>\nhalf months since she came?<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we honor our children and it makes more work for us.  Sometimes <br/>\nit&#39;s way more work than we wanted but I see the joy in my son&#39;s face when he <br/>\ncomes in from work or class or a ballgame and HIS puppy runs to greet him.  In my <br/>\nopinion it&#39;s way better than a grandchild at his young age.  It lets him know <br/>\nreal quick that no matter what his girlfriend says, he is NOT ready for <br/>\nanymore responsibility than the puppy, she&#39;s too much at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nI HATED the IDEA of yet another puppy but I LOVE the puppy that is here, work <br/>\nand all, chewed clothes and all, crazy face kisses and all, nighttime <br/>\nsneaking under the covers and all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorta like the food you were hesitant to try but your mother said it was oh <br/>\nso good, maybe your daughter is nudging you towards something you might very <br/>\nwell love.

A puppy is a lot of work and getting an older dog<br/>\nwould certainly help cut down on that whole time thing. Plus explain to your<br/>\ndaugher what a great thing you would be doing not just for her but for this<br/>\nlonely dog who has no home now. Visit the Humane Society and check out your<br/>\noptions. Visit often and don&#39;t just decide on what&#39;s there because your<br/>\ndaughter wants a dog. The shelters generally try real hard to be honest<br/>\nabout the dogs they place. They don&#39;t want an unhappy family bringing the<br/>\ndog back. Explain that there are children and a cat. The shelter here states<br/>\nwhether they are use to children and other animals, whether they are<br/>\nhousebroken or not. Older dogs are less likely to chew also. Plus you can<br/>\nsee the size and decide short or long hair. I&#39;m wanting to visit the shelter<br/>\nnow just by talking about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe important thing is to take your time chosing.

I do<br/>\nnot like dogs.  I like and have cats, chickens emus etc.  Dogs<br/>\neat chickens and chase cats all too often.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, here is what we did.  Some of it may work for you.<br/>\nFirst I did some research with folks who use assistance dogs -<br/>\nthey are very practical about their working dogs.  In their<br/>\nestimation essentially no kid is going to be able to take full<br/>\ncare taking responsibility for a dog, especially for training a<br/>\npuppy.  No matter how responsible and dedicated the owner is, we<br/>\nare talking kids.  Your daughter may vary in this, but it led me<br/>\nto see the responsibility thing differently.  She had to be old<br/>\nenough dedicated enough to be the dog&#39;s emotional owner/&quot;alpha<br/>\nperson&quot;.  She didn&#39;t need to be old enough to drive to the vet&#39;s<br/>\nor order Frontline Plus.  5 seemed to be about the right age for<br/>\nthat and was.  She feeds the dog, brushes the dog (more or less<br/>\ndaily), plays with the dog because they go on rambles together.<br/>\nShe is a lost cause for training the dog - smart as Percy is, she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get long explanations of &quot;When I do this, you do that,<br/>\ngood baby dog&quot; and DD doesn&#39;t get Skinnerian modification as a<br/>\nlearning style, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond we did breed research - a lab pretty as they are would<br/>\nhave driven us crazy, but a collie was a good idea.  She on her<br/>\nown selected collie as we researched, read stories, talked to<br/>\npeople who have dogs.  I would be really sure that your daughter<br/>\nhas a good idea of what is involved in keeping a lab fully<br/>\noccupied enough to be a happy dog - they are pretty and friendly<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird - and this was a VERY helpful piece of advice - skip the<br/>\npuppy stage if at all possible for your first time around.  That<br/>\nwas the single happiest tid bit we got.  Percy is a rescue dog<br/>\nwho came to us at about a year, mainly collie, fully vaxxd,<br/>\nwormed, housebroken at so forth.  We got to know her personality<br/>\nand preferences before we took her; we knew she liked cats.  Her<br/>\nformer owner still touches base from time to make sure she is a<br/>\nhappy dog.  After almost 2 years with her, I would be willing to<br/>\nundertake a puppy maybe.  DD would love a dog who is not &quot;fixed&quot;<br/>\nbecause she would like to see how mamma dogs raise puppies.<br/>\nDunno; may happen; am hugely glad we got a &quot;broken&quot; mostly grown<br/>\nrescue to start with though.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheran@...\">sheran@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 08, 2003 5:23 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] pets/dogs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| Continuing the pet thread...<br/>\n|<br/>\n| My daughter is turning 10 this month.

She really wants a dog.  Dh <br/>\nfinally said ok, IF she can be the one to take care of it.  Neither <br/>\nhe nor I want the responsibility--it&#39;s enough taking care of the <br/>\nhouse and the kids!  Neither of us mind having a dog around if she <br/>\ndoes the work.  We made it very clear to her all of the things she <br/>\nwould need to do.  She wants a chocolate lab.  We found a breeder and <br/>\nare waiting for the dog to have puppies. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were at the library she got some books on dog care and read a <br/>\nlot.  She wrote stuff down from the book so that she could tell her <br/>\ndad and I about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen one day she came to me crying.  She didn&#39;t know if she should <br/>\nget the dog or not.  She said she really wants it but doesn&#39;t know if <br/>\nshe will be able to handle the responsibility.  She also said that <br/>\nshe&#39;s afraid she&#39;ll feel that it&#39;s unfair that her younger brothers <br/>\nwill enjoy playing with the dog but she&#39;ll end up doing all the <br/>\nwork.  I was torn.  I didn&#39;t know whether to encourage her to go for <br/>\nsomething that she really wanted (a puppy) or to seriously consider <br/>\nthe reality of all the work a puppy would be.  I ended up telling her <br/>\nto just give it some more thought, that the decision was hers, and to <br/>\nspend some time thinking about whether she wanted the dog badly <br/>\nenough to be willing to spend the time on the puppy that she would <br/>\nneed to spend on it.  I&#39;d be paying 200 for this dog so I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto just get it and give it away if it doesn&#39;t work out. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, a neighbor girl has gotten a lab puppy and has spent a lot of <br/>\ntime playing with it in our yard and even brought it into the house <br/>\nonce.  Our cat was terrified of the dog.  I grew up with a dog and a <br/>\ncat living peacefully in the same house--we even had a cat nursing <br/>\nfrom a dog alongside the puppies!  But our cat really is terrified of <br/>\nthis dog.  If we got a dog, what if the cat never got used to it? (Dd <br/>\nis also very attached to the cat and would be heartbroken if the cat <br/>\nchanged personalities or got hurt because of the dog)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what would you do?  Encourage her to get the dog, or encourage her <br/>\nnot to get the dog?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73589,"nextTopicId":73664}}
