Worse, if it&#39;s a &quot;reward&quot; for doing something I don&#39;t want to do I despise the person offering it because they are disguising their controlling me.  What am I a rat you can manipulate with a morsel!!?  Little people are in touch with this feeling too. They do the action, but hate it and you.  So you have to up the ante over and over.  One gold star, two, three, a book, a bike, a car, a sports car.  On and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if we unschool, we open the world to what they want to do naturally.  Intrinsic motivation.  It works in business too and in management.  A friend (and unschooler) has transformed a bank branch in a small town into Western Canada&#39;s top producer with intrinsic motivation - let them do what comes naturally and all HQ-Toronto manipulative &quot;contests&quot; and bribes never make it into his branch.  The staff was relieved!!!!  We can focus on what we do well and give customers service they deserve and no unnatural pushy behaviour to get the gold star.  I&#39;ve met these people.  Wow! They rock!  Still, HQ wants it to stop.  Dangerous!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, no, a job is not a bribe.  But a gold star is a bribe and a manipulation.  It can be subtle, but to the victim, it&#39;s as clear as crystal!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thots, <br/>\n<br/>\nTim Thomas<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Tia Leschke <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, April 30, 2003 6:39 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Punished by Rewards<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;  &lt;&lt;So bribery depends, just like a lot of things, on the situation.<br/>\n  &gt;  It&#39;s not the best way to get someone to learn something....doesn&#39;t work<br/>\n  &gt; very<br/>\n  &gt;  well.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; The point is it does work sometimes and why say it&#39;s not a good tool when<br/>\n  &gt; sometimes it is?<br/>\n<br/>\n  It might be a good tool for some things, but it&#39;s not a good tool for<br/>\n  getting someone to learn something.<br/>\n  Tia<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary<br/>\n  saftety deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;  Ben Franklin<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
