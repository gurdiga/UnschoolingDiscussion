I am new to unschooling and have not gotten<br/>\ncompletely comfortable with it yet. I hear so much about the emphasis<br/>\non the importance of MATH that I panic when I don&#39;t see Azure doing<br/>\nany (I just haven&#39;t noticed that, yes, she is really doing &quot;math&quot; in<br/>\neveryday life!) Your words are comforting to me and I will check out<br/>\nyour website. I am new to this list, but already I know it will be<br/>\nvery valuable to me. I appreciate any and all advice that I am given -<br/>\nthank you. I guess that I am more comfortable with unschooling other<br/>\nsubjects and just need to treat math the same way. I know that (in my<br/>\nhead at least) she will learn what she needs to know for college, I<br/>\njust get scared and revert to my old home &quot;school&quot; thinking. This list<br/>\nis awesome. I am not alone, I now know people who also unschooling and<br/>\nthey are sucessful in raising educated kids. I have a lot to learn<br/>\nabout letting go of my old thinking.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111117,"nextTopicId":111137}}
