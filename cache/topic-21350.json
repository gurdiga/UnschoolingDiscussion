I just<br/>\nhave one thing to say about it.  BRAVO!<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n******************************************************<br/>\nI think we need to realize, though, that the people<br/>\ndoing these studies have a different opinion about<br/>\nwhat kind of &quot;achievement&quot; is important, and what kind<br/>\nof &quot;coping skills&quot; are best.  I do not agree that<br/>\nachievement is important, nor that the typical coping<br/>\nskills are necessarily healthy (and I have been<br/>\ntrained as a psychological counselor).  Therefore, I<br/>\ncannot look to these studies to tell me what is best<br/>\nfor my child, because the parameters of the study will<br/>\n<br/>\nonly give the researches the answer to the questions<br/>\nthey asked....and I believe they are asking the wrong<br/>\nquestions, therefore getting the wrong answers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAuthoritarian parenting is not good, we agree on that.<br/>\n But I don&#39;t believe authoritative is any better.  I<br/>\nbelieve there is a kind of parenting that is not<br/>\nmeasured by any study, and has yet to be  labeled<br/>\nbecause so few parents use it, and so few researchers<br/>\nunderstand it.  I personally would call it &quot;intuitive<br/>\nparenting&quot;.  All the other labels...authoritarian,<br/>\npermissive, etc....focus on the parents disciplinary<br/>\nstyle.  But I don&#39;t believe you have to focus on that.<br/>\n That&#39;s focusing on externals....behavior.  I believe<br/>\nwe need to focus <br/>\non what&#39;s inside....thoughts, feelings, and<br/>\nperceptions, which is what makes people behave the way<br/>\nthey do.  I don&#39;t think the studies focus on that type<br/>\nof parenting, and therefore I personally don&#39;t put<br/>\nmuch faith in those traditional, mainstream type of<br/>\nstudies.<br/>\nJudie C.
