I often use<br/>\nthe example of a friend&#39;s son who picked out which<br/>\npaintings were by Picasso out of a coffee table book<br/>\nwhen he&#39;d never seen Picasso paintings before, all<br/>\nbecause he&#39;d watched Toy Story. You know when Mr<br/>\nPotato Head puts all his body parts on one side and<br/>\nsays &quot;Look, I&#39;m Picasso&quot; Who would have thought Toy<br/>\nStory was so educational? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t wait for the TV binge to be over with before<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; get on with life. I think parents who have said they<br/>\n&gt; tried to let there kids to self regulate and it<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; work were waiting for the TV binge to stop then when<br/>\n&gt; the TV binge stopped they would have helped their<br/>\n&gt; kids<br/>\n&gt; do cool stuff. But if there isn&#39;t cool stuff<br/>\n&gt; happening<br/>\n&gt; how is a kid to choose to do the cool stuff over TV/<br/>\n&gt; in addition to TV.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Very true.

If it looks interesting, he&#39;ll join you, and if you&#39;re<br/>\nbusy yourself, you won&#39;t spend this time worrying about him.  If he gets<br/>\nbored with the tv, and isn&#39;t interested in what you&#39;re doing, he&#39;ll find<br/>\nsomething else or ask you for an idea.  If you can give this your all, I<br/>\nthink you&#39;ll both be happy in the end.
