And one <br/>\nthat will go into the arsenal ;-&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIntro:<br/>\nI&#39;ve been on the list for a bit now, but mostly unable to read the <br/>\npostings (been busy). I&#39;ve been hsing since 1995, but have been <br/>\nunschooling my children since birth. My dh is supportive, but <br/>\nconstantly worries me about what they know, and college, etc. I&#39;ve <br/>\nexplained to him my position: It is more important to me that my <br/>\nchildren be HUMAN, ie be able to empathize with others, treat others <br/>\nwith respect and dignity, and generally deal with others in a <br/>\npositive, uplifting fashion, than it is for them to know the times <br/>\ntables, or the atomic weight of plutonium, or the exact date that the <br/>\nConstitution was ratified. In my opinion, these things can all be <br/>\nlooked up (unless you&#39;re answering the questions as a contestant on <br/>\nJeopardy &lt;g&gt;); and anyway, how many people do we know of who remembers <br/>\nmost of that stuff that we were force fed as children *anyway*?!?<br/>\n<br/>\nI digress. We live in a small town, and everyone knows me as the &#39;lady <br/>\nwho homeschools her kids&#39;, so my children are constantly scrutinized, <br/>\nit seems. But people generally comment that they are very smart, what <br/>\nam I doing to make them that way? &lt;lol&gt; *I* didn&#39;t *make* them smart, <br/>\nthey *are* smart!! <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is so great to be around other people who actually think about why <br/>\nthey are doing things, and if something is not working, to ditch it. <br/>\nMost people that I know of won&#39;t do that, even if it causes them pain. <br/>\nMy hats off to you! <br/>\n<br/>\nLaVeda Mason</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76374,"nextTopicId":76388}}
