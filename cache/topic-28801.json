Wyndham couldn&#39;t<br/>\nread because he believed he couldn&#39;t do it.  My mom moved in next door<br/>\nand he started going there regularly for the food.  But the price of the<br/>\nfood was that she got to &quot;teach&quot; him.  He&#39;s perfectly okay with that<br/>\narrangement.  He gets attention and food and I run interference if she<br/>\ngets too pushy about it to suit him.<br/>\nNow, I realized something a few days ago . . . the reason she could help<br/>\nhim learn to read and I couldn&#39;t is because I have no patience for<br/>\nrepetition.  She was a special ed. teacher for 14 years and taught second<br/>\ngrade before that.  The &#39;read the same book three thousand times&#39; thing<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t phase her a bit.  The patience to listen to him sound out the<br/>\nsame word six times on the same page doesn&#39;t reside in me, but it does in<br/>\nher.  <br/>\nSo tell your daughter that the key to learning this stuff may just be<br/>\npatience to do it again and again.  Mind you , I didn&#39;t say make her sit<br/>\nthere and do it whether she wants to or not, just tell her that she<br/>\nshould be patient with herself and that you will be patient with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n          Bridget<br/>\n                                Nollaig Shona  --  S�och�in ar domhan, <br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n     In three words I can sum up everything I&#39;ve learned about life: it<br/>\ngoes on.<br/>\n                                                     - Robert Frost</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Kolleen","from":"Kolleen &lt;Kolleen@...&gt;","profile":"kaydeecross","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"LHMqLrCFr0dBNOpEeKVg1HzKKeCFvjBX8E5WUFr9yiCcdyd_EU57hd14QT-1LrwKu3LPcBmcFZnSp1QvCkQVyg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1633","postDate":"1007040589","msgId":28888,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDExMTI5MTMzNi5mQVREYWZGVzAxMjM5MEBueWNzbXRwMm91dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":28882,"nextInTopic":28899,"prevInTime":28887,"nextInTime":28889,"topicId":28801,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... *Nods in agreement* Taking that leap of faith in your child is the most precious gift you can give them. kolleen","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1167466028\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;Julie write:<br/>\n&gt;Ack!!!!!
