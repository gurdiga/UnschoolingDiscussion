I<br/>\nabsolutely believe in the process of unschooling and do not worry about<br/>\nwhether my daughters are learning or not- I know they are. I&#39;m also not<br/>\nworried that they don&#39;t think they&#39;re learning- they&#39;re both very confident<br/>\nand think they know everything ;-) I guess I&#39;m torn when it comes to<br/>\nlabelling or pointing out their learning though. It&#39;s important for them to<br/>\nknow that they are capable learners and to acknowledge just how much<br/>\nlearning is going on, but I also don&#39;t want to separate life out like that-<br/>\nit&#39;s ALL learning. And that&#39;s it, isn&#39;t it- I hate that question! When<br/>\npeople ask what we did today, I feel that I&#39;m being asked to make our life<br/>\nfit into their idea of what &quot;real&quot; learning is. And I don&#39;t want to!<br/>\n(Erin&#39;s right- I did have to take ownership of the &quot;problem&quot;) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I did have a good discussion with my daughters tonight and I feel<br/>\nbetter. I realised that I&#39;d never really told them what unschooling is, so<br/>\nwe talked about that and what it means to all of us. I told Zoe that our<br/>\nreading the Little House books could be thought of as her &quot;history lesson&quot;,<br/>\nthat asking her to double the dipping sauce recipe tonight could be her<br/>\n&quot;math lesson&quot; and it was like the light came on in her head! She said, &quot;Oh,<br/>\nthen when I read the story of Romulus and Remus to Molly this morning, that<br/>\ncould be _her_ history lesson!?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe decided that when someone asks again, they can tell people about the<br/>\nbooks they&#39;re reading, the things they&#39;re building in the workshop, the<br/>\nstories they&#39;re working on... and that they played all day too!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again- I&#39;d still like to hear more!<br/>\n<br/>\nLyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8118,"nextTopicId":7224}}
