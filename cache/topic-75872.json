Gosh, we are avid campers <br/>\nand we do know how to eat out of cooler and hot pot ( a fire would be nice, but <br/>\nI dont think the hotel would allow it).   We can all fit in a room with 2 <br/>\ndouble beds, although sleeping on the floor is fun and they may end up having a <br/>\nslumber party too.   I talked with another friend today who has been to the <br/>\nconference and she absolutely loved it.   I thought the deadline for registration <br/>\nwas the end of this month, but she refreshed my memory that is it not until <br/>\nAug 19.. SOOO, I have a couple more weeks to scheme and scrape.. LOL.    I am <br/>\ngoing to do everything I can in order to come!
