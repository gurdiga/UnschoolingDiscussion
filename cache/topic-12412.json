Last year my son did an &quot;experiment&quot;<br/>\n&gt; where he (unknown to me) stuffed toilet paper in the bathroom sink drain<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; overflow hole, turned on the faucet full blast and closed the door.  Then<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; suggested we play outside.  I, again unknowingly, agreed and three hours<br/>\n&gt; later returned.  Once I felt the squishy carpet (10 feet down the hall)<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; discovered the ocean of water streaming out of the bathroom down the<br/>\nhallway<br/>\n&gt; and into the heating ducts, I was a screaming zombie!!!!  The water ruined<br/>\n&gt; the subflooring, carpet and pad (throughout 3/4 of the house), ductwork<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; swelled the doorjambs and drywall.  The damage was over 5 thousand<br/>\ndollars.<br/>\n&gt; Thankfully insurance picked up a good deal of the &quot;experiment&quot;.  I asked<br/>\nhim<br/>\n&gt; later what he was trying to do...he said that he was trying to create an<br/>\n&gt; ocean by closing the door.  Boy, at the time, school was sure looking<br/>\ngood.<br/>\n&gt; And there are other days when I think school doesn&#39;t look all that bad.<br/>\nBut<br/>\n&gt; I must admit, that it was pretty smart of him (at four) to have noticed<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; the water flows out better if you stuff it into the overflow hole!  But<br/>\n&gt; seriously, I know that I would be having equally hard days (if not harder)<br/>\n&gt; sending him off to school and all the issues that brings.  I so enjoy<br/>\nseeing<br/>\n&gt; him grow and learn (and experiment--within reason!) and I would not want<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; miss that for the world.<br/>\n&gt;     I understand your frustrations.  It sounded like though that the day<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; going really well up until that point.  Hang on to the treasures of the<br/>\nday.<br/>\n&gt; We keep a short journal and write down tidbits of the day to reassure us<br/>\n&gt; that we are on the right path.
