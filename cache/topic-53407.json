One hardly knows where to start!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy jury duty lasted 7 weeks, ending last Friday, just in time for <br/>\nme to feel festive for a few days, bury the house in a wash of <br/>\ntissue paper and bows, and Get Through Christmas. Since <br/>\nChristmas is, for me, a month-long softly glowing celebration of <br/>\ntradition, baking and festooning everything including the cat with <br/>\nribbons, you can only imagine what Pam&#39;s Christmas-on-Fast-<br/>\nForward looked and felt like. Joyous like a Roller Coaster. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJury duty. Everyone whines about it, I spent the 7 weeks utterly <br/>\nfascinated by the Shakespearean tragedy that had been <br/>\nenacted. I wonder if all murder scenarios today were foretold by <br/>\nthe Bard? My 11 fellow jurors swore never to sit on another <br/>\nmurder case, I would again in a second.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe play was written thus: Jake Silva, a jealous and abusive <br/>\nboyfriend (just 18 years old); Renee Ramos, a &quot;cheating&quot; <br/>\ngirlfriend (just 18 years old); the stage is set in a small but <br/>\ncrime-ridden burg and the participants are all members of a <br/>\nskateboarding and graffiti gang (first lesson learned: one does <br/>\nnot want one&#39;s children to cultivate the society of some to most <br/>\nskateboarders. Who knew?) This gang-of-children had an older <br/>\n&quot;friend&quot; (where &quot;friend&quot; is defined as &quot;pervert child molester&quot;) <br/>\nwho bought the alcohol for their frequent parties. The <br/>\nskateboarding gang called themselves Grim Crew.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe prosecutor was an angry veteran who obviously (and one <br/>\nfeels not unreasonably) takes every murder case deeply <br/>\npersonally. He was jovial and Columbo-like towards us jurors, <br/>\nbut turned red-faced and enraged to some witnesses (including <br/>\nour defendant, on the stand for over 2 days during his defense <br/>\ntestimony). Some of the prosecutor&#39;s camp and anger was an <br/>\nact, but it was an act based on him in reality -- he played up his <br/>\nnatural Columbo-like shenanigans, and waved his arms a bit <br/>\nmore than required in his rages, but it was, at the root, all him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe defense attorney I actually felt sorry for, where previously I <br/>\nhave had a great deal of contempt, at least at times, for the <br/>\nspecies. Hers was a catastrophically difficult task, and I expect <br/>\nmost of her cases are. I am perhaps still naive, but I think the <br/>\nlegitimately not-guilty defendants are vastly outnumbered by the <br/>\nlegitimately guilty. Being a defense attorney seems to me like it <br/>\nwould be like coaching a perpetually-losing sports team. For all <br/>\nthat, she was talented. She and the prosecutor had an obvious <br/>\nrespect for each other. Objections and sidebars were few, <br/>\nshouting between the attorneys non-existent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe witnesses often lied and often lost track of their lies. I filled <br/>\nup 7 notebooks of notes on the trial, and I was not the most <br/>\nprolific note-taker of the jurors. There was video testimony and <br/>\nDNA evidence and false trails laid by the defense and leaps to <br/>\nsome facts by the prosecution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe jury was excellent. There was a great deal of common <br/>\nsense and little folly. We guarded fiercely those amongst us who <br/>\ncould not help babbling about the case as they walked down the <br/>\ncourt hallways. *** and *** were always escorted to lunch and <br/>\nback by a pack of us, ready to turn the subject as necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe families both attended every day of the trial. We knew them <br/>\non sight and they knew us. The courtroom was like a horrific <br/>\nparody of a wedding with the &quot;bride&#39;s&quot; side (the victim Renee&#39;s <br/>\nfamily) and the &quot;groom&#39;s&quot; side (the accused murderer Jake&#39;s <br/>\nfamily).<br/>\n<br/>\nRenee&#39;s mother was first on the stand, looking sad and very <br/>\ntired. I imagine she has looked that way since her daughter was <br/>\nmurdered over 2 1/2 years ago. Various family members rotated <br/>\nin and out in supporting her as the days went on -- Renee&#39;s <br/>\nstepfather, Renee&#39;s grandmother, Renee&#39;s aunt.<br/>\n<br/>\nJake&#39;s stepmother was there every day, with various supporters. <br/>\nJake&#39;s father was seldom in the courtroom -- one reason was <br/>\nthat he was a defense witness and could not be present until <br/>\nafter his testimony, but even after that he was mostly absent. He <br/>\nis a small man, physically dwarfed by his young, strong son. He <br/>\nlooked bewildered, and his testimony was confused. He was too <br/>\nhonest to lie on the stand and too terrified for his son to tell the <br/>\ntruth. I felt even worse for him than I did for Renee&#39;s mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe crime scene photos were as bad as you can imagine. <br/>\nRenee was gang-raped and beaten and strangled, three <br/>\ndifferent strangulations with accompanying marks, including the <br/>\nfinal strangulation that killed her. It was 2 to 5 days before they <br/>\nfound the body. The prosecution, in submitting photos to us on <br/>\nthe jury, arranged the order of one set to: Renee&#39;s school photo, <br/>\nshowing a pretty blond girl about a size 5. Then the four boy-men <br/>\nand man implicated in her rape. Then the worst of the crime <br/>\nscene photos of Renee. I wonder if the prosecution really <br/>\nthought that anyone on our jury would not notice and resent the <br/>\ntactic?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn spite of the lying witnesses, in spite of the prosecution&#39;s heavy <br/>\nhand, we went into the jury room knowing what had happened <br/>\nwithout much to talk about. I was elected foreperson (yes, you <br/>\ncan all smile here, I know you never doubted it. :) We took a poll <br/>\non the most serious of the three counts, the murder, and came <br/>\nto 11 guilty and one undecided.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe undecided was ***, a young man who was the conscience <br/>\nof the jury. I will be grateful to him forever for bringing up every <br/>\ntiny possible doubt he had and making all of us carefully <br/>\nexamine it. By the time *** had finished with his last concern, and <br/>\nhad gone over with the rest of us the evidence that answered <br/>\neach concern, we were a sad but resolute body.<br/>\n<br/>\nJake Silva is now 20 years old. He has been in prison since a <br/>\nfew months after Renee&#39;s murder, when he was arrested, and <br/>\nhe will now be in prison for the rest of his life. Not one of us <br/>\nenjoyed sending him there, but not one of us would do it <br/>\ndifferently for the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were bright spots -- our judge liked us because we were <br/>\nattentive, we liked him because he was so fair in the courtroom, <br/>\nand looked after our comfort. Our main bailiff was the nicest man <br/>\nin the world and fussed over us like a hen. I carpooled with <br/>\nanother juror, an 80-year-old world traveler who wanted to be a <br/>\nrace car driver in her youth.
