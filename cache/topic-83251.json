After a few times, I realized it wasn&#39;t working.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was real young - like 3 or 4 - Rosemary (next door kid) was a major biter. It never occurred to me to bite her back. It wasn&#39;t apart of my reality.<br/>\nHer mom would BITE her everytime Rosemary bit someone. I never squealed - but then she bit me so hard she drew blood on my right arm and my mom saw it and told her mom - her mom drew blood from Rosemary. I thought that was so sick.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight, Brianna & I will smudge and pray for all the kids that were taken from us and all the kids that are suffering.<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: joylyn <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, October 26, 2003 9:31 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Even state supervision doesn&#39;t help...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lisa Steinsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have a book on her.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She attended school every day.

Officers discovered that<br/>\nthe teen-ager weighed only 45 pounds (20 kg). His adoptive siblings -- aged<br/>\n9, 10 and 14 -- weighed as little as 23 pounds (10 kg).<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It really strikes at the heart of anyone that has any sense of compassion.<br/>\nAnd, quite frankly, it boggles the mind,&quot; Camden County prosecutor Vincent<br/>\nSarubbi told a weekend news conference.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents Raymond Jackson, 50, and his wife Vanessa, 48, claimed the boys<br/>\nsuffered from eating disorders but a physician found no evidence of<br/>\ninherited deficiencies, authorities said. The couple also had two adopted<br/>\ngirls, aged 5 and 12, and were in the process of adopting a 10-year-old<br/>\ngirl.<br/>\n<br/>\nAuthorities said the parents&#39; two biological children, a boy and a girl both<br/>\nover 18, lived in the same house and appeared healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe three younger boys were removed from the Collingswood home and sent into<br/>\nfoster care, while the 19-year-old was hospitalised. The girls were also<br/>\ntaken from the home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe state case worker who had been visiting the Jacksons resigned, and 10<br/>\nmanagers and supervisors from the state Division of Youth and Family<br/>\nServices were suspended with pay.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe division has been under fire over a series of child abuse cases,<br/>\nincluding one that involved a 7-year-old Newark boy whose decomposing body<br/>\nwas discovered with his two starving brothers in January.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Jacksons have been charged with four counts of aggravated assault and 14<br/>\ncounts of endangering the welfare of a minor.

I know she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t do it personally for me, but I could see where she&#39;s coming from.<br/>\nI started to read the first article and then started skimming quickly<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s yada, yada, yada, to me.  I started homeschooling on the<br/>\nwhole religious precept and have WOW gradually thought what is going on<br/>\nhere.  So thanks Sandra, it worked for me.

It was immediately clear to me that the history was bogus, so I<br/>\nstopped. It was not until after Sandra and Nancy posted that I thought I<br/>\nhad better force my way through the whole thing. I think the second half<br/>\nabout returning to the family would stand on its own without the<br/>\nfaux-history of the homeschooling movement introduction, if people are<br/>\ndetermined to pass it on to their spouses etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I would not have known about the white supremacist<br/>\njargon (rather than just some catch phrase invented by the author) if I<br/>\nhadn&#39;t been informed of it, simply because it is outside of my<br/>\nexperience. It is interesting how seemingly innocuous phrases take on a<br/>\ndifferent meaning when you realize they have been co-opted by that kind<br/>\nof political extremism. I appreciate being warned about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I see articles that have as part of their theme &quot;The Collapse of<br/>\nthe Family&quot; and &quot;The Loss of the Father&quot; I get wary.

It has lots of detailed stats on<br/>\nmarriages and remarriages. Marriage sure does seem popular. Contrary to<br/>\nthe notion that half of all new marriages end in divorce, these<br/>\nstatistics show it will be only 33% (one third) after 10 years. There<br/>\nare statistics about remarriage after divorce too. That seems to say<br/>\nthat the majority of people stay married, or want to be married. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150551601,"authorName":"Stepheny Cappel","from":"&quot;Stepheny Cappel&quot; &lt;stephc62@...&gt;","profile":"stephc621587","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Homeschooling Article","postDate":"1067197129","msgId":83254,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZDUwMWMzOWJmOCRjODUzNDE4MCQxYzhlZDZkMUBzdGVwaGM2Mj4=","referencesHeader":"PDE0Yy4yNWUyNzBjMi4yY2NkNWY4ZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":83253,"nextInTopic":83259,"prevInTime":83253,"nextInTime":83255,"topicId":83251,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I actually enjoyed Sandra pulling apart that post for me.

I know she didn&#39;t do it personally for me, but I could see where she&#39;s coming from.  I started to read the first article and then started skimming quickly because it&#39;s yada, yada, yada, to me.  I started homeschooling on the whole religious precept and have WOW gradually thought what is going on here.  So thanks Sandra, it worked for me.
